Spanish Files offers a unique look into this fascinating chapter of Spanish history.\n\nFor more local news and events in the Almeria province click here."

        "article_content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Can artificial intelligence be an effective wingman?\n\nRoman Khaves, co-founder and CEO of Rizz, thinks so. The AI dating assistant app analyzes screenshots of conversations you're having on other platforms \u2014 from Tinder to iMessage \u2014 and crafts reply suggestions.\n\nRizz amassed millions of downloads since launching in 2022, with more and more competition also emerging into the dating scene since.\n\nKhaves recently spoke with The Associated Press about the demand for this kind of platform, how AI is being used to find in-person connections, and what guardrails are needed to bring AI technology into such an intimate part of our lives.\n\nThe interview was edited for clarity and length.\n\nQ: How does Rizz work?\n\nA: Rizz is an AI dating assistant. If you're stuck in a conversation or you don't know how to open up on a dating app, you can pull out Rizz and upload a screenshot of a particular profile or conversation that you're having trouble with on that other platform. It will give you tons of suggested replies \u2014 and also a strategy on how you could start the conversation or respond to certain things.\n\nThe more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you like. That trains the model to improve over time.\n\nQ: Why launch this kind of app?\n\nA: Three years ago, I personally found myself stuck in the middle of dating app conversations. Sometimes, I would take a screenshot to send to some of my friends and say, \"Hey, what do I say next?\" We knew there had to be a better way.\n\nThe moment ChatGPT hit the scene, that's when we launched Rizz. We integrated the API technology with our product to make it possible.\n\nWe saw immediate traction. We've had over 7.5 million downloads to date, growing about 30% month over month, since launching in 2022. There's clear demand for this type of product.\n\nQ: Who are your biggest competitors?\n\nA: I'd say at least 40% of our screenshots and conversations come from messaging apps like iMessage and Instagram.\n\nWe get a lot of Instagram, which I would argue is the biggest dating app in the world today \u2014 and Instagram recently added an AI feature that can give you different variations of how to rephrase a message, like more funny or witty suggestions. So, for now, Instagram is a huge competitor.\n\nTinder also suggested openers. It's still very different than what we do \u2014 we take it a step further and we give users a strategy \u2014 but I think those are the biggest competitors, as well as ChatGPT. There's many similar apps now and new ones emerging every single day.\n\nQ: What would you say to folks who may be concerned about bringing AI into their dating life? Where do there need to be guardrails?\n\nA: We're not trying to replace human connection. We're just trying to help people get to the date in the first place \u2014 because it is hard out there. A lot of people don't even know how to start conversations online, and I think AI is helping boost that confidence.\n\nStill, privacy and control is critical in this new world of AI. We could have built Rizz very differently. We could have made it so that Rizz would respond automatically or connect to the dating apps \u2014 but we don't do any of that. All users are in control of exactly what gets sent out to their match. And we are going to continue building with these priorities in mind.\n\nQ: What's next for AI and dating?\n\nA: A lot of the big dating companies are thinking about how to leverage AI in order to enhance human connection in this space today. That's also what we set out to do, and are still improving on.\n\nRizz is currently built to help you get off dating apps as quickly as possible. Next, we might want to help you beyond the first date, perhaps with future date ideas or something like birthday gift ideas. It's really about supporting the user throughout their journey."

        "article_content": "To keep the ghosts at bay, read on for Entertainment Weekly\u2019s list of the 30 best paranormal movies, ranked.\n\nParanormal movies mainly preside in the horror and thriller genres, but there are a few comedic or dramatic exceptions. Almost all of them offer audiences an indelible glimpse of the supernatural that real life, for better or worse, doesn\u2019t afford us. There\u2019s nothing like that implacable tingle, that crawling dread, of films like these.\n\nOne has to wonder how ghosts and ghouls have time to haunt us when they\u2019re so preoccupied acting in paranormal movies. Certainly, the genre lets us live vicariously through (often ill-fated) characters who either summon or accidentally encounter some of the other side\u2019s residents.\n\n30. Paranormal Activity (2007) Everett Collection Oren Peli\u2019s genre-defining found footage thriller stars Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat as a couple who believes their suburban home might be beset by malevolent forces of some kind. With the help of a handy digital camera, the pair set out to find the source of the nightly disturbances. The Paranormal Activity franchise has gone so far down the rabbit hole that it\u2019s easy to forget its ultra-simple, stripped-back roots. Peli structures his picture in the seamless style of old-school horror-thrillers, first by establishing the characters and then spinning scares from their relationship that further exacerbate the bumps in the night. Where to watch Paranormal Activity: Max\n\n29. Session 9 (2001) Everett Brad Anderson\u2019s skin-crawling ghost story follows a group of sanitation workers (led by David Caruso and Josh Lucas) who encounter some creepy goings-on, and even spookier recordings of therapy sessions, when they\u2019re sent to clean out a disused mental asylum. Journeyman director Anderson outdid himself with this rollicking yet understated horror-fest, which executes its finest scares without using much more than its ingeniously unsettling sound design. Where to watch Session 9: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n28. The Frighteners (1996) Everett Peter Jackson\u2019s jolly horror-comedy finds an architect turned exorcist (Michael J. Fox), who\u2019s able to communicate with departed spirits, trying to solve the mounting body count in his idyllic small town while romancing the widow (Trini Alvarado) of one of the victims. Nobody does their respective jobs as well as Jackson and Fox do theirs, and to see these two working together is almost too much goodness to behold. The Frighteners is just as goofy and splattery as you want a Jackson genre picture to be, anchored in a solid mystery and Fox\u2019s preternatural ability to command the screen. Where to watch The Frighteners: Tubi\n\n27. Insidious (2010) Everett Collection Josh and Renai Lambert (Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne) move their family to what should be an idyllic suburban home; but when one of their children falls ill, the Lamberts uncover a much darker reason behind his ailment. James Wan\u2019s haunted house picture essentially birthed Blumhouse\u2019s brand of inexpensive, wildly lucrative horror. In the same vein of Paranormal Activity, Wan\u2019s film launched a sprawling franchise with a simple, effective formula that packed an additional wallop for having been absent from cinemas for some time by the 2010s. Where to watch Insidious: Peacock\n\n26. It Follows (2014) Everett David Robert Mitchell\u2019s astonishing paranormal picture has spawned a litany of imitators, none of which match It Follows\u2019 distinctive mix of mood, high-concept plotting, and propulsive fear. Jay (Maika Monroe) has sex with her boyfriend Hugh (Jake Weary) only to discover he\u2019s passed along a fatal curse that she can only shake by sleeping with another person. And so it begins its shape-shifting pursuit \u2014 slow, deliberate, agonizingly persistent. Mitchell conjures a maddening sense of dread out of the simplest techniques; once we\u2019ve seen the entity walking toward Jay, every person casually moving in the background feels like a threat. Of course, It Follows is as much about growing up as it is about fear and sex \u2014 or, rather, it\u2019s about what\u2019s scary about growing up, the dying of the youthful presumption of safety, protection, and immortality. Where to watch It Follows: Netflix\n\n25. The Amityville Horror (1979) Everett Collection This classic haunted house tale tells the unfortunate \u201ctrue\u201d story of George and Kathy Lutz (James Brolin and Margot Kidder), who buy a rambling house on Long Island only to discover its murderous past and supernatural inhabitants. A tremendously effective horror story that takes its time to eke out substantial frights, Stuart Rosenberg\u2019s completely over-the-top vision of yuppie-dom gone awry kicked off one of Hollywood\u2019s most dubious franchises. Though a few of the sequels have their merits, Amityville in Space and Amityville Karen remain for completists only. Where to watch The Amityville Horror: Max\n\n24. Sinister (2012) Phil Caruso/Summit Entertainment Scott Derrickson\u2019s brilliant found footage-cum-haunted house tale stars Ethan Hawke as a morally murky true crime journalist who moves with his wife (Juliet Rylance) and kids into the home where a brutal family murder took place, the inspiration for his latest book. Things go badly, and only get worse when Hawke finds a box of 16mm snuff films in the attic. Derrickson is a woefully underrated horror director, and Sinister is his crowning achievement. The gory recordings are photographed in a surrealistic, utterly chilling manner, and, set to Christopher Young\u2019s masterful industrial score, they carry an uncommon power. Where to watch Sinister: Max\n\n23. Child\u2019s Play (1988) United Artists/Everett Tom Holland\u2019s franchise kick-off finds the soul of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) transferred into a cherubic Good Guys doll named Chucky. When the toy makes its way into the home of Andy (Alex Vincent) and his exhausted mother (Catherine Hicks), only a dedicated detective (Chris Sarandon) can stop the bloodshed. Holland treats the idea of a loony murderer\u2019s spirit occupying a doll\u2019s form with an uncommon seriousness. Though some of the later installments veered into comedy, this original makes a compelling case for taking Chucky very seriously indeed. Where to watch Child\u2019s Play: Tubi\n\n22. Final Destination 2 (2003) Everett Collection David R. Ellis\u2019 wildly entertaining first sequel in the admirably consistent franchise follows a group of spring-break revelers (led by A.J. Cook and returning star Ali Larter) who manage to avoid a catastrophic highway pileup only to find themselves being picked off, one by one, by that dreaded specter known as Death. Breathtakingly gory and hell-bent on a very particular type of early-aughts destruction, Final Destination 2 is a slasher movie crossed with something approaching a supernatural action film. It\u2019s remarkably entertaining and always rewatchable, with a few murder set pieces that will make you genuinely wince. Where to watch Final Destination 2: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n21. Ringu (1998) Mary Evans/Ronald Grant/Everett Reiko (Nanako Matsushima), a reporter, sets out with her ex-husband (Hiroyuki Sanada) to investigate the ghostly phenomenon of a disturbing videotape that seemingly killed her niece. Hideo Nakata\u2019s seminal fright flick kicked off a sprawling franchise across several continents, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Ringu possesses a singular sort of fear that few films can pull off. Watching it leaves you with that unshakeable, unpleasant feeling of recalling too vividly a particularly disturbing nightmare.

The Others (2001) Everett Collection Grace (Nicole Kidman) moves with her children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley), who possess a sunlight allergy, into an isolated country cottage as she awaits the return of her husband from fighting in WWII. There, the arrival of a governess (Fionnula Flanagan) and her peers kicks off a series of horrifying supernatural occurrences that threaten to unravel Grace\u2019s reality. A wonderfully paced, brazenly old-fashioned ghost story, The Others feels timeless as all the best horror films do. Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar directs with a lush eye for atmosphere and details, while the oft-imitated twist ending feels earned and emotionally cathartic. Where to watch The Others: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n19. The Eye (2002) Everett The Pang Brothers\u2019 ultra-spooky immersion into the supernatural underworld stars Angelica Lee as Mun, a prodigious blind musician who is gifted sight with a radical corneal transplant. Yet as she\u2019s tormented by visions of the dead, Mun wonders if sight is worth her mental sanity. One of Hong Kong\u2019s signature modern thrillers, The Eye got swept up in American audiences\u2019 fascination with Asian horror from the late \u201990s through the aughts, later receiving an obligatory remake in 2008 starring Jessica Alba. Like most modern horror encores, that version is best left unseen; it can\u2019t match the Pangs\u2019 contemporary twist on classical, spine-tingling fright. Where to watch The Eye: Not available to stream\n\n18. The Beyond (1981) Everett Collection Lucio Fulci\u2019s paranormal masterwork concerns a young woman (Catriona MacColl) who inherits a palatial hotel that sits above the gates of hell. Predictably, things don\u2019t go so well for her. To define what the experience of The Beyond is actually like is\u2026 well, if you\u2019ll forgive the paraphrased steal from Casablanca, it\u2019s like any other Italian horror movie, only more so. Fulci embraces nightmare logic as enthusiastically as any filmmaker of his genre or generation, and this film is him at his gorily most unhinged. He indulges his penchant for toe-curling eyeball violence and subtly effective set design in this everything-and-the-kitchen-sink haunted house riff. Where to watch The Beyond: Peacock\n\n17. Jennifer\u2019s Body (2009) Doane Gregory/TM and Fox Atomic/Courtesy Everett Collection Karyn Kusama\u2019s supernatural high-school dark comedy, written by Diablo Cody, is utterly excellent despite its initially lackluster reviews. Amanda Seyfried plays Needy Lesnicky, the dowdy best friend to the popular/hot/cool/flexible Jennifer Check (Megan Fox). When Jennifer is sacrificed as part of a devilish ritual by a skeevy rock band, she returns as a succubus with a taste for teenage boys\u2019 flesh. Jennifer\u2019s Body is one of those perfect fusions of time and place, capturing that mid-aughts period when pop culture was paradoxically alt. Cody also flexes her sprawling knowledge of the horror genre, making for a riotously entertaining film with a ferocious satirical undercurrent. Where to watch Jennifer\u2019s Body: Tubi\n\n16. Talk to Me (2022) A24 This recent A24 effort from Australian directors Danny and Michael Philippou is one of the studio\u2019s scariest outputs yet. A mummified hand that can imbue its possessors with both horrifying glimpses of the afterlife and a drug-life euphoria threatens to undo a suburban family when a young boy (the stupendously natural Joe Bird) spends too long on the other side and becomes possessed. Remarkably unsettling and shockingly brutal, Talk to Me is a singular horror film that ranks among this decade\u2019s finest. With a smart application of style and humor, the Philippous crafted a relentless modern chiller. Where to watch Talk to Me: Paramount+\n\n15. Suspiria (1977) 20th Century Studios Dario Argento\u2019s groundbreaking opera of furious sight and sound concerns young Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), who upon being sent to a prestigious German ballet academy discovers that it is but a front for a coven of youth-siphoning witches. Argento\u2019s galvanizing picture remains a masterclass in harnessing the power of image and music to beguile an audience. It also feels as fresh and exciting today as it did almost 50 years ago. Where to watch Suspiria: Xumo Play\n\n14. Lake Mungo (2008) Mungo Productions After their teenage daughter (Talia Zucker) drowns, a family begins experiencing strange events in their home. They call in a paranormal psychologist, who uncovers disturbing secrets while parsing through their surveillance camera and cell phone footage. This is a particularly somber and understated movie, resembling domestic dramas like Ordinary People more than traditional horror films. With a canny mix of found footage and faux-documentary, Lake Mungo transports the audience into its spare, chilling universe. Where to watch Lake Mungo: Tubi\n\n13. Hereditary (2018) Toni Collette; Hereditary. A24 Ari Aster\u2019s astonishingly original yet somehow terrifically old-fashioned ghost-and-witchcraft story stars Toni Collette as a bereaved mother who turns to the paranormal in the hopes of contacting family members she\u2019s recently lost. As the supposedly well-intentioned woman leading her to doom, Ann Dowd commits to one of the most insidious villain performances in modern horror history. The movie that established Aster as an art-house freakout auteur, Hereditary is breathtakingly, exhaustively intense and frequently just as emotional. That Collette didn\u2019t collect an Oscar nomination for this role is a stain on the Academy. Where to watch Hereditary: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n12. The Orphanage (2007) Everett Collection J.A. Bayona directed this Spanish production about a young woman (Bel\u00e9n Rueda) who buys the orphanage in which she grew up with the intention of converting it into a home for infirm children. When her son goes missing, she turns to the many ghosts residing within the home to aid her desperate search. More than a bit inspired by Guillermo del Toro\u2019s The Devil\u2019s Backbone, The Orphanage weaves a similarly melancholy and thematically rich haunted house tale that calls on the country\u2019s complicated past to inflect its plot with verisimilitude. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s exceptionally scary. Where to watch The Orphanage: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n11. Jacob\u2019s Ladder (1990) Everett Adrian Lyne\u2019s mind-warping erotic thriller stars Tim Robbins as a Vietnam vet plagued with horrifying hallucinations once he returns stateside. As he discovers he's not the only member of his platoon to experience such oddities, Jacob is further removed from his already tenuous reality. A thoughtful and enveloping exploration of psychosis, Lyne\u2019s film remains a high-water mark in the psychological freak-out genre. Robbins grounds the eccentric proceedings with his reliable everyman persona, while Lynne one-ups his signature opulent visual style in such a way that he often wrong-foots the audience\u2019s genre expectations with nothing more than a simple camera move. Where to watch Jacob\u2019s Ladder: Amazon Prime Video\n\n10. The Sixth Sense (1999) Everett Collection Young Cole (Haley Joel Osment) is plagued by visions of those who died violent deaths. His exasperated mother (Toni Collette) seeks help in the form of a psychologist (Bruce Willis), who may have more in common with Cole than he thinks. M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s classic ghost story popularized a now-ubiquitous twist ending and got all of us swearing we saw dead people. It\u2019s still a hard-edged, substantially creepy fable with a heart-wrenching central performance from Osment and some of Willis\u2019 best dramatic acting. Where to watch The Sixth Sense: Max\n\n9. Cat People (1942) Everett Collection A well-intentioned husband (Kent Smith) accidentally ignites his wife\u2019s (Simone Simon) supernatural curse, in which she transforms into a large feline when aroused. She then goes about stalking her nemeses, including the beautiful woman (Jane Randolph) with whom her partner has become infatuated. Jacques Tourneur\u2019s fabulously creepy and macabre exploration of jealous sexual awakening features some unbelievably detailed sets and camerawork that seem innovative even today. Far from the staid paranormal horrors produced during this period, Cat People is ferocious and mysterious in equal measure. Where to watch Cat People: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n8. Rosemary\u2019s Baby (1968) Courtesy Everett Collection Roman Polanski\u2019s adaptation of Ira Levin\u2019s satirical shocker stars Mia Farrow as a young housewife who begins to believe her dream pregnancy is a cover for something much more nefarious, as her actor husband (John Cassavetes) brings an eccentric elderly couple (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) uncomfortably into their lives. Polanski\u2019s picture is elegant yet abrasive, an uncommonly lovely combination. Farrow is terrific in the lead role, getting the audience almost instantly on her side as the director ratchets up the tension to an unbearably chilling climax. Where to watch Rosemary\u2019s Baby: Paramount+\n\n7. Poltergeist (1982) Everett Collection Tobe Hooper\u2019s story about a suburban family (helmed by Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams) beset by paranormal activity in their new home, which may or may not be built on an ancient burial ground, is completely insane. It\u2019s one of the first horror movies to feel like an out-and-out action (or even disaster) movie, with crumbling sets and flashing lights right out of a Clive Barker climax. Poltergeist has endured, though, because its scares are rooted in this authentic family unit\u2019s terror. We feel for them, and the dissolution of their \u2014 \u201980s American dream. Where to watch Poltergeist: Amazon Prime Video (to rent)\n\n6. The Innocents (1961) 20th Century Fox Film Corp./Courtesy Everett Based on Henry James\u2019 The Turn of the Screw, Jack Clayton\u2019s spine-chilling ghost story (with a script by Truman Capote, among others) stars Deborah Kerr as a governess sent to an isolated estate to care for two odd children (Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin). There, she encounters \u2014 what else? \u2014 disembodied voices and vengeful spirits. Clayton\u2019s exceptionally frightening haunted house picture established many of the genre\u2019s most beloved tropes, a great deal of which are still in circulation today. Nearly every film on this list has arguably drawn inspiration from The Innocents. Here, Clayton creates a masterful mood of dread and dense mystery within a rich and oddly cozy atmosphere. Where to watch The Innocents: Not available to stream\n\n5. Hausu (1977) Everett There\u2019s no other way to describe Nobuhiko Obayashi\u2019s film except for \u201cgenuinely f\u2014ing crazy.\u201d Even to call it a haunted house movie seems tame; it\u2019s more of a spiritual home invasion, really. A group of seven schoolgirls \u2014 all with cheeky names like Kung Fu and Mac (for \u201cstomach,\u201d because she likes to eat) \u2014 venture to the home of one girl\u2019s aunt, where they\u2019re beset by disembodied, bottom-chomping heads, possessed mattresses, and hungry ghosts. Obayashi\u2019s picture is an authentically singular experience, and also a rather sweet one. It plays like a live-action, exaggeratedly silly Studio Ghibli movie. Where to watch Hausu: Max\n\n4. The Haunting (1963) Everett Collection Robert Wise\u2019s adaptation of Shirley Jackson\u2019s masterful novella finds a specially selected group of people brought together to spend a night at the famously haunted Hill House. Each has their different motives \u2014 Eleanor (Julie Harris) wishes to separate from her overbearing family; a gregarious psychic (Claire Bloom) hopes to write a bestselling book; Dr. John Markway (Richard Johnson) wants to uncover the home\u2019s paranormal truth. Joined by the home\u2019s heir (Russ Tamblyn), they set about uncovering the home\u2019s insidious past. Wise crafts an elegant and memorable ghost story here, retaining much of Jackson\u2019s scabrous dialogue while improving upon the suspense set pieces established in her book.\u200b\u200b It\u2019s one of the spookiest, and most elegant, haunted house pictures ever made. Where to watch The Haunting: Tubi\n\n3. The Shining (1980) Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) encounters the Grady twins (Lisa and Louise Burns) inside the Overlook Hotel in 'The Shining.'. Warner Brothers/courtesy Everett Stanley Kubrick\u2019s supernatural opus continues to spark scrutiny and debate almost 50 years later. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a has-been writer, takes a job at the Overlook Hotel as the off-season caretaker so he can write his next novel. Soon, his family (wife Shelley Duvall and son Danny Lloyd) experiences gory hallucinations and unexplainable events within the corridors. Kubrick\u2019s film is a devastatingly rendered portrait of an artist\u2019s descent into psychosis, one that\u2019s implicit through the pursuit of crafting a great work. The Shining is every bit as meticulous and fetishistic as its reputation would suggest, with Kubrick using his stern directorial hand to create a sense of unease on screen. Where to watch The Shining: Max\n\n2. Evil Dead II (1987) Everett Sam Raimi\u2019s gleeful, gore-gag-laden romp (essentially a higher-budget, more jocular spin on his 1981 original) finds Bruce Campbell\u2019s Ash once again battling a group of Deadites in a remote cabin. Raimi strikes an inimitable tone of feel-good fun that precious few films are able to attain, let alone those in the horror genre. The director previously compared this movie to The Three Stooges with viscera standing in for custard pies, and that\u2019s the precise vibe one feels upon viewing. There\u2019s nothing offensive or off-putting in Evil Dead II, only a merry sense of the possibilities paranormal filmmaking presents. Where to watch Evil Dead II: Plex"

Janus wanted to give Philip information about saving the planet.\n\n\"The meeting never took place, and most likely this character Janus was actually a Russian spy,\" the film says.\n\nIn addition, historian Richard Felix in the film suggests that the late Queen Elizabeth wanted to study the secret documents of the Vatican.\n\nAccording to Felix, at the headquarters of the Catholic Church in The Vatican has a well-known secret archive where documents are kept, possibly several thousand years old, which describe in detail the origins of Christianity and the like. But there are also claims circulating that they are keeping the truth about the UFO phenomenon.\n\n\"Fifty-three miles of corridors full of secret documents and objects, including alien skulls in the basements of the Vatican and other things.

Similar wasp species are known to target flies during their younger, more vulnerable larva and pupa life stages.\n\nThe study, led by Logan Moore during his doctoral studies at Mississippi State University, was published in the journal Nature on September 11.

The egg then hatches into a tiny wasp larva, which grows inside the fly for about 18 days before leaving its host for dead.\n\n\"It will effectively emerge out of the side of the fly, and just to add an additional layer of horror, the fly will normally remain alive for several hours after that,\" Morre said, explaining the chilling process."

        "article_content": "Nobel laureate Andre Konstantin Geim called on the next generation of scientists to resist the pull of routine and go beyond the confines of their job descriptions in order to make meaningful contributions to their fields.\n\n\u201cToo many brilliant minds have wasted their lives trapped in the comfort of routine. It is when we step outside our comfort zones and explore new ideas that we often find ourselves doing the most important things in our lives and careers,\u201d said Geim, Regius Professor and Royal Society Research Professor, University of Manchester, UK.\n\nProf Geim was in Chennai on Saturday, addressing the 15th Convocation of Hindustan Institute of Technology and Science (HITS).\n\nGeim highlighted the challenges and rewards of pushing the boundaries of human knowledge. He urged the graduates to embrace both the challenges and opportunities ahead and to push beyond conventional limits in their pursuit of discovery.\n\nHe pointed out that his most impactful work emerged from simple, curiosity-driven projects he pursued outside of his official duties. \u201cA mere act of pouring water into an electromagnet led to the world\u2019s first demonstration of magnetic levitation. Similarly, an attempt to mimic how geckos climb walls resulted in the creation of a revolutionary dry adhesive, now a major research topic,\u201d he said.\n\nProf Geim, a Dutch-British physicist of Russian descent, is renowned for his pioneering work in condensed matter physics and material science. His most notable achievement is the discovery of graphene, which earned him the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics alongside Konstantin Novoselov.\n\nNote on his discovery of graphene\n\nDelving into the details of his Nobel Prize-winning discovery of graphene, Geim highlighted how curiosity served as the driving force behind the breakthrough. \u201cI\u2019m not even a biologist! The experiment that earned me the Nobel Prize began with a simple question: What if we keep dividing graphite into smaller and smaller pieces until it can\u2019t be divided any further? This curiosity led to the discovery of graphene, the thinnest material in existence. It is through these moments of curiosity and daring to think beyond routine that we make our most significant breakthroughs, often the turning points of our careers,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Indian aerospace scientist and Padma Bhushan awardee Nambi Narayanan shared the challenging journey of ISRO scientists in developing a liquid-fueled rocket engine. This technology now powers many of the country\u2019s successful space missions and marks a pivotal moment in the nation\u2019s space exploration efforts.\n\nP Veeramuthuvel, Project Director at ISRO, also addressed the convocation, discussing the challenges faced during the Chandrayaan-3 mission. He stressed the importance of learning from failures, highlighting resilience, teamwork, and rigorous testing as crucial elements in overcoming obstacles and achieving success.\n\nAnand Jacob Verghese, Chancellor of HITS and Chairman of the Hindustan Group of Institutions, called on the new graduates to harness their knowledge and skills to make a meaningful impact on society. He urged them to work towards creating a brighter future for themselves and future generations"

        "article_content": "Wounds that resist healing have long posed a significant challenge in medical care, but a recent discovery offers a solution that combines luxury with cutting-edge science.\n\nResearchers have tapped into the remarkable healing properties of gold nanoparticles mixed with antioxidant-rich red wine.\n\nThis unexpected fusion of precious metal and natural compounds paves the way for a revolutionary approach to treating chronic wounds and other medical conditions.\n\nTraditional medicine and new technology\n\nIn the heart of South Africa, the University of the Western Cape hosts a team of researchers driven to make significant strides in medical science.\n\nThe team\u2019s dedication to exploring novel solutions for persistent health challenges has led them to a fascinating discovery that blends traditional medicine with cutting-edge technology.\n\nTheir latest research was focused on a concoction combining gold nanoparticles with the potent antioxidants found in red wine. The innovative formula has shown tremendous potential, as lab tests revealed that it significantly accelerated wound healing.\n\nRemarkably, in just 72 hours, wounds treated with this unique mixture of gold and red wine healed almost entirely \u2013 a promising and exciting outcome that could pave the way for future advancements in chronic wound care.\n\nThe dangers of chronic wounds\n\nChronic wounds, defined as those that fail to heal within three months, represent a widespread and persistent health challenge, affecting approximately 3.8 million patients each year.\n\nChronic wounds often stall in the inflammatory phase, a stage where the body\u2019s natural healing processes become hindered. This prevents progression to the crucial remodeling phase where new tissue begins to grow and repair the damaged area.\n\nFor individuals with underlying conditions like diabetes, this issue becomes even more serious. Poor blood circulation, a common complication of diabetes, exacerbates the healing process, leaving these wounds vulnerable to infections.\n\nIn severe cases, the inability to heal can lead to devastating outcomes, including the risk of limb amputation. Identifying solutions for chronic wound care is a medical priority.\n\nThe wound healing power of gold\n\nThe research team hypothesized that gold could act as the ideal catalyst to jump-start the healing process for chronic wounds.\n\nGold\u2019s renowned anti-inflammatory properties, combined with its natural compatibility with human tissues, have made it a valuable element in medical treatments for centuries.\n\nIts unique ability to reduce inflammation without causing adverse reactions allows gold to interact harmoniously with the body, promoting faster recovery.\n\nHistorically, gold has played a significant role in medicine, with gold particles being used as early as the 20th century to treat chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis in the UK.\n\nBuilding on this legacy, the research team explored how gold could unlock similar benefits in the realm of wound care, providing a modern twist to an age-old remedy.\n\nPowerful antioxidants of red wine\n\nRed grapes, the foundation of many popular wines, are rich in powerful antioxidants like resveratrol. These naturally occurring compounds play a crucial role in protecting the body from oxidative stress by neutralizing harmful free radicals.\n\nFree radicals can damage cells and impede the healing process, but the antioxidants in red wine help to counteract these effects.\n\nBy combating these damaging molecules, resveratrol and other antioxidants support the body\u2019s ability to repair itself.\n\nThe antioxidants ensure that tissues receive a sufficient oxygen supply, which is essential for regeneration and recovery, ultimately boosting the healing process and enhancing the body\u2019s natural defenses.\n\nCombining gold and red wine\n\nThe team tested their hypothesis by drying red wine to obtain extracts, which were then mixed with chloroauric acid, a gold-containing chemical.\n\nThe blend was applied to a lab dish containing human skin cells, with a scratch in the middle to simulate a wound.\n\nCells treated with this golden mixture saw an 80% wound closure within 72 hours, compared to 50% with wine alone.\n\nThe combination of cabernet sauvignon and gold proved even more effective, healing wounds almost entirely in the same time frame.\n\nThe future of wound care\n\nRenowned vascular surgeon Stella Vig of Croydon University Hospital praised the novel use of red wine and the innovative production of gold nanoparticles. Both silver and gold nanoparticles could play a critical role in reducing wound infections.\n\nDr. Ahmed Osman from Queen\u2019s University, Belfast added that gold particles encourage cell growth and enhance the natural healing process of the skin.\n\nThis revolutionary approach to wound healing, combining gold and red wine, holds remarkable promise for the future of wound care.\n\nWhile further research is needed, the implications are significant, opening new avenues for advanced medical treatments.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

When they arrived in town, Katelyn Potts went to Sleep in Heavenly Peace's website to see if there was a chapter she could join.\n\nThere wasn't a local chapter, so she started her own last month.\n\nMTN News\n\n\u201cThe estimate is 3% nationwide of kids sleep on the floor, so that's either a mattress on the floor, the floor itself, a couch, whatever it may be,\u201d Katelyn Potts said. \u201cIt definitely is needed here. It's needed everywhere, but it's needed here.\u201d\n\nTheir goal is to build and deliver fully furnished beds to kids in our community that don't have one.\n\n\u201cI know there's a lot of good nonprofits out there that do a lot of things, but there's plenty of kids in our community that I know are sleeping without beds,\u201d Adam Potts said. \"She (Katelyn) approached me as something she wanted to get started. So as a good husband and a supporter of her, I said yes. And as soon as we started getting involved, I was excited about it.\"\n\nBefore they can start building, they need the communities help.\n\nMTN News\n\n\"The whole goal of it is to get as much community members involved as possible. We want as many hands on that bed and impacting that child's story because that helps people build their story, the Sleep in Heavenly Peace, and that helps get the word around as to who we are and what we do,\" Katelyn Potts said. \"You can either do a donation, request to volunteer with us, or partner with us. So we would partner with different organizations, depending on how many beds they want to sponsor. We would bring all of our tools and equipment to that bed build.\"\n\nThey will accept donations of new bedding or handmade quilts to furnish the beds.\n\n\"Sometimes we hear stories about a child being sixteen and that's their very first bed. It's just mind blowing. It's not something you think about on a day to day basis. It's something I think about all the time now. But it's not something people just think about,\" Katelyn Potts said. \"I would say every child deserves a good night's sleep. And they need it. It helps them get through the school day. It helps them get through. Maybe there's some rough things going on at home. But being able to have a good night's rest, it all starts at home.\"\n\nTo get involved with the Billings chapter of Sleep in Heavenly click here.\n\n\u201cWe want to get Billings involved to help get the children of Billings off the floor,\u201d Katelyn Potts said."
