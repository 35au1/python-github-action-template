            "article_content": "Experts have revealed dozens of theories over the years\n\nMYSTERY SOLVED? UK\u2019s most famous UFO sighting could finally be solved 45 years on \u2013 as expert reveals \u2018electromagnetic PLASMA\u2019 theory\n\nTHE UK's most famous UFO sighting could finally be solved 45 years on - as an expert revealed a new \"electromagnetic plasma\" theory.\n\nMystery lights spotted by SAS troopers in December 1980 could have been down to a \"mass psychosis\" caused by \"electromagnetic plasma\" coming from the earth, they revealed.\n\n3 The mystery lights are believed to be down to a 'mass psychosis'. Pictured, a sculpture now at the site Credit: Alamy\n\n3 The Rendlesham Forest UFO incident information board Credit: Alamy\n\n3 The plasma theory was first put forward by Dr Ron Haddow Credit: Alamy\n\nMany high ranking officers from the US Air Force personnel reported seeing a triangular alien craft in Rendlesham Forest, a remote part of Suffolk.\n\nOne even claimed to have got close enough to touch a \"triangular spacecraft\".\n\nBut despite multiple investigations into the sighting no explanation for the glowing scenes was ever found.\n\nPhilip Mantle, an expert in UFO sightings, has revealed he may know what really happened that night.\n\n\"If you look at what those involved said to begin with, the only concrete info was that they saw strange lights in the forest - that's what we start with,\" he told Metro.\n\nThe plasma theory was first put forward by Dr Ron Haddow.\n\nPhillip said: \"He was concerned this plasma emitted a type of electromagnetic energy, which could interfere with aircraft communications of cause cognitive impairment.\"\n\nBritish UFO expert Albert Budden later showed that the Earth produces electromagnetic forces which can emit light - otherwise called the plasma.\n\nPhillip added: \"Some people can be hypersensitive to these lights - in other words allergic - and can have the most bizarre experience you'll think is absolutely real.\n\n\"It could be these soldiers came into contact with it and all hallucinated.\"\n\nHe also discounted old theories, which suggested SAS troops staged the sighting as revenge on US troops, saying \"pranking\" would not have taken place in the heat of the Cold War.\n\nThe theory was upheld by UFO enthusiast Dr David Clarke who said, \"lights and coloured flares were rigged in the woods and black helium balloons were coupled to remote-controlled kites.\"\n\nBut like Phillip, former Ministry of Defence UFO investigator Nick Pope, told the Sun Online he was sceptical of such claims.\n\nNasa discovers mysterious green spots on Mars that could be signs of ancient alien life Despite its nickname of 'the Red Planet', mysterious green dots have been discovered in the sand on Mars. Nasa's Perseverance rover, which has been navigating Mars for nearly four years, stumbled upon the new mystery in a region called \"Serpentine Rapids\". After scraping away the top layer of regolith in a red rock outcrop named \"Wallace Butte\", the rover uncovered a \"striking\" array of colours within the rock, Nasa wrote. Colours of white, black and even green were discovered. \"One of the biggest surprises for the rover team was the presence of the drab-green-colored spots within the abrasion patch, which are composed of dark-toned cores with fuzzy, light green rims,\" Nasa added. The green patches can also be found on Earth's so-called 'red beds' - areas of sediment where water, carrying iron, has filtered through, and eventually hardens into rock.\n\nHe told the Sun Online: \"It's classic friend-of-a-friend stuff: a ufologist claims he was contacted by a former SAS soldier, who claims he was involved in a prank.\n\n\"Frankly, there's no evidence such a prank even occurred, let alone that it played a role in the infamous Rendlesham Forest incident.\n\n\"Having undertaken a cold case review of this incident for the MoD, I can confirm that the events in Rendlesham Forest 40 years ago remain unexplained.\n\nThe US airman Jim Penniston's claim that he touched the aircraft is also dubious, according Philip, who said his account changed over time.\n\nHe said: \"Jim underwent hypnosis a few years back and said the craft was a machine from the futures.\"\n\nHe admitted however that the plasma theory could also be an incorrect assumption as UFO researchers all \"suffer confirmation bias\".\n\nHe added: \"But I'm sure Rendlesham's legend will only continue to grow in the years ahead.\""

            "article_content": "British UFO expert and filmmaker, Mark Christopher Lee\n\nBritish UFO expert and filmmaker, Mark Christopher Lee, has asserted that the images of a mysterious orb at Manchester Airport are unequivocally evidence of a UFO. Recently delving into so-called \"drone\" episodes at military installations across the UK, Lee is now scrutinising the curious event at Manchester Airport. The imagery, dating back to June, has sparked a wildfire of speculation on social media platforms like X (once known as Twitter) and Reddit, where it was shared. The footage depicts a round entity captured by an alleged co-pilot on the tarmac, seen either soaring in the sky or \"hovering\" just above ground near another plane. These events trail a spate of similar sightings, specifically several orbs spotted over Washington DC's supposed no-fly zone. The person who released the Manchester sighting description claimed the UAP matched the size of a small vehicle. Intrigued, Mark Lee has flagged this incident as particularly noteworthy. Drawing parallels with historical accounts, he mentioned: \"This blue orb sighting reminds me of UK researcher Timothy Good who wrote about the Australian government capturing an alien sphere in 1957 - it was made of an unknown substance and had no visible means of levitation.\"\n\nWARNING TAKEN FROM TWITTERCAPTION: UAP at Manchester Airport causes frenzy on Reddit with alien fansLINK: https://x.com/PNWMPA/status/1861843806074876103/photo/1\n\nLee elaborated that this peculiar object was apprehended at Woomera's Nuclear test facility in Australia and eventually found its way to the Wright Patterson Airforce Base in the USA, reports the Daily Star. Discussing the recent Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) activity he's been investigating, he stated: \"People are assuming that the UAP sightings at military bases in the East of England are Russian drones. But eye witnesses of locals who have seen these UAPs state that they move very slowly and if they are Russian how did they get here - have they flown all this way at such a slow speed\" Mark further revealed that his research for his new film - The Rendelsham UFO - The British Roswell - about an alleged UFO landing at a military base in Suffolk in 1980 (RAF Bentwaters) - has led him to believe that an alien intelligence is constantly monitoring our military bases (particularly those with Nuclear weapons). With global tensions currently high, he believes the alien presence has increased its surveillance using AI drones.\n\nUAP at Manchester Airport causes frenzy on Reddit with alien fans\n\nHe said: \"What we found with the Rendelsham UFO - was that an alien presence was monitoring the Nuclear weapons that were being stored at RAF Bentwaters as part of the NATO defence during the Cold War.\" However, a spokesperson from Manchester Airport dismissed any theories of extraterrestrial visitors in this case. He suggested that the most likely explanation is either a weather or helium balloon, and questioned the authenticity of the photograph showing an object hovering above the ground on the airfield. \"We have systems that pick up anything that could be a threat to aviation,\" he said. He stated: \"Anything that gives off a signal we would know about.\" He added that if there was anything on the airfield, as depicted in the photograph, it would be treated as a major incident, and no such disruption-causing event has occurred.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "A veteran UFO investigator has claimed that UFOs have visited America's nuclear weapons sites since the dawn of the atomic age \u2014 and he believes these intruders may have the power to 'neutralize' such weapons.\n\nRobert Spearing is an investigator for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), which has 700 investigators in the US and is one of the world's oldest UFO organizations, having collected evidence of suspected extraterrestrial encounters since the 1960s.\n\nSpearing said that among MUFON's files \u2014 and the organization has nearly 137,000 reports on UFO encounters from the US and around the world \u2014 there are multiple cases alleging alien visitors hovering above nuclear bases and nuclear-armed ships.\n\n'There is enough evidence that the visitors have the ability to neutralize their use,' as Spearing told DailyMail.com.\n\n'The question is whether it is for defensive purposes or offensive purposes,' according to Spearing. 'It's either to save us from ourselves or to ensure they could destroy us if they had to.'\n\nWhen former Pentagon counterintelligence official Luis Elizondo reemerged this summer, the veteran UFO hunter floated an equally dire theory: the dozens of UFOs sighted near nuclear bases since 1945 could be scouts for a potential invasion.\n\nSpearing personally investigated one sighting from the Vietnam War, which he believes shows at least a definite 'connection' between UFOs and nuclear sites.\n\nAbove, US Coast Guard photographer Shell Alpert took this photo through a window screen on July 16, 1952 - allegedly capturing four unidentified flying objects in a 'V' formation over the Salem Massachusetts Air Station - back in the early days of the 'UFOs and Nukes' mystery\n\nWhether their intentions were for good or ill, as he told DailyMail.com, 'There was all sorts of stuff coming out of the South China Sea' during the war, as well.\n\nJanuary 15, 1973 - South China Sea\n\n'I enjoy the Vietnam cases the most,' Spearing said.\n\n'This particular encounter happened when, in theory, no one knew that the United States had nukes that were close to China and Vietnam,' according to the MUFON director, who previously worked as a forensic investigator for railroads as part of the New York Port Authority.\n\n'But,' Spearing added, 'somebody knew.'\n\nA witness on board ammunition ship the USS Mauna Kea reported seeing a strange orb of pulsing light come out of the sea, while the man was loading nuclear-tipped missiles onto the USS Oklahoma City.\n\nHe described the encounter in his report as a 'hovering pulsating orb shape color, similar to a large beach ball hovering about 30 to 50 feet above the water, hovering at approximately 16 to 18 knots.'\n\n'Could see reflection on water,' the witness continued, 'could see clearly underneath no wake.'\n\nWhen the encounter occurred, the man was loading nuclear weapons with a forklift.\n\n'This sighting was in the South China Sea off the port beam,' he said. 'Our ship was an ammunition ship carrying nuclear weapons. It felt as if we were being probed.'\n\nSpearing interviewed the witness himself, and said that the man 'felt chills and felt he was being observed'.\n\nA witness on board the ammunition ship the U.S.S Mauna Kea reported seeing a strange orb\n\nThe orb was 'car-sized' and was visible up close for around 10 minutes, between two and four AM.\n\nWhen the witness checked the radar room, no one had registered images of the object.\n\nSpearing described the encounter as 'very suspicious,' saying, 'There is, of course, the possibility it was a plasma ball, like ball lightning, which was carried along by being magnetically linked [attracted] to the ship hull.'\n\n'However, the duration of sighting is too long for ball lightning and ball lightning would have been [further] attracted into the hull and would have exploded.'\n\nMay 1960 - Mountainside, New Jersey\n\nA witness approached MUFON about an eerie encounter in 1960 near a nuclear base in New Jersey.\n\nThe witness told MUFON's investigators that a group of young children and teens saw a formation of silver discs hovering near a nuclear base while leaving their homes at dusk.\n\nThe Watchung Mountains base housed Nike Ajax missiles designed to shoot down incoming bombers - the project experimented with nuclear-tipped missiles, before the focus shifted towards ICBMs rather than nuclear bombers.\n\nThe children knew there was a base in the area, and had done many safety drills in school as a result \u2014 making it easy to determine that that these mysterious discs were hovering above the base.\n\nIn 1957, during the Cold War, the U.S. army declared that it would construct a Nike missile base on the Watchung Reservation\n\nAbove, a Minuteman III missile in a silo in the late 1970s.\n\n'I know this was a long time ago,' the witness said, 'but... when exiting the woods above our homes we were shocked to find a perfect V formation of five plain, dull silver discs hovering over us. No sound. No movement.'\n\n'After about five minutes they took off to the west without making sounds of any kind. The location where we were is on the edge of \"first mountain\" just west of New York City,' the witness told Spearing.\n\n'Directly above us, about one mile, on the top of the mountain was a deeply buried nuclear anti-ballistic missile in a military outpost in the Watchung Mountains which was part of NYC area defense system,' the source continued.\n\n'We realized when talking about it, that it seemed that these discs were hovering above that nuclear warhead site. I have never forgotten it.'\n\nMUFON closed the case (which has never been reported before in the mainstream media), classifying the oddity as an 'unknown UAP'.\n\nThe USS Kilauea was in a group with other ships including the carrier U.S.S. Mason\n\nAbove, three classic flying saucers in a photo dramatization\n\nEarly 1974 - Vietnam\n\nWhile investigating the first encounter in Vietnam, Spearing came across another eerie account of an orb visiting another nuclear-armed ship.\n\nThe witness said that they were in a group with a destroyer and an aircraft carrier, the USS Mason, when they saw a incredible craft exit the water.\n\n'We were watching the USS Mason in front of us and the glowing trail of ocean it was kicking up from the phosphorus algae in the water when the ocean in front of us lit up, started glowing,' the witness said in astonishment.\n\n'It got brighter and brighter and then this really bright orange/yellow ball came out of the water on the right-starboard side of the destroyer.'\n\n'It flew over the top of the destroyer and went back in the ocean on the port side, with the same glowing ocean water and then disappeared,' this Navy source continued. 'We all just stared at each other with our mouths open.'\n\n'We could not believe what we saw, but I asked friends of mine who were on watch on the bridge if they saw it,' he noted, 'and they all did.'\n\nThe witness said that the object was up to 200 feet in diameter \u2014 and that officers on the destroyer must have had a 'good look at it' although nothing was ever officially recorded.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nRetired US Air Force staff sergeant, Larry Hancock, who has contributed to a series of studies on the UFOs and nukes connection for the Scientific Coalition of UAP Studies (SCU), believes that just the regularity of these events offers solid clues.\n\nSolid military and police cases from 1945 to 1975, Hancock told DailyMail.com this year, appear to show intentional study of America's most sensitive weaponry.\n\n'I mean, focus implies intention,' he said. 'And focus obviously implies intelligence.'\n\n'The way it progressed from one type of facility to another type \u2014 I mean, it starts with manufacturing plants, moves on through assembly plants, storage, deployment, it's hard to read that as anything other than someone having an agenda,' according to Hancock.\n\nHancock's research partner, Ian Porritt, ventured even a little further: 'They may have a better understanding of the future, our future, than we do.'"

            "article_content": "Podcasts can be a great way to learn complex subjects, but not everything you're reading has been discussed in an episode. AI audio maker ElevenLabs is solving that with a new feature that reshapes documents you upload into an audio show with virtual hosts discussing the subject matter. The newGenFM feature is part of the ElevenLabs Reader App and will turn any mix of PDFs, articles, and digital books into your own personal podcast episodes.\n\nThe new feature shares many similarities with Google NotebookLM, which uses Google Gemini AI models to turn documents into podcast-style shows where synthetic personalities discuss whatever you've uploaded to each other. As with Google's feature, GenFM analyzes the information you upload and produces a synthetic podcast with two AI co-hosts discussing the material. GenFM even attempts to match the voices to the topic under discussion.\n\nIf you're an auditory learner or need to absorb information while doing other things, GenFM is likely to appeal to you. That said, while GenFM restricts itself to the documents you upload, you'll likely still want to be wary of any accidental hallucinations or misunderstood data. You can see and hear some examples in the demo video below.\n\nAI podcast future\n\nThough GenFM and Google NotebookLM are pursuing the same kind of product, ElevenLabs' AI-generated podcast efforts are a step beyond Google's. NotebookLM is currently limited to the web and can only make shows in English. In contrast, GenFM's AI hosts can converse in 32 languages. Still, both tools cater to more diverse ways of learning and lifestyles.\n\nThe potential demand from students alone will likely justify the work behind GenFM. And, unlike some other ways AI composition tools are used in academia, this doesn't raise ethical questions about cheating or plagiarism. They also increase accessibility to those with impaired vision who don't want to hear a long document read out when they could hear a podcast about it. They also democratize access to information, enabling individuals with visual impairments or reading difficulties to engage with content more easily.\n\nYou might also like"

            "article_content": "As you scroll through your social media feed or let your favorite music app curate the perfect playlist, it may feel like artificial intelligence is improving your life \u2013 learning your preferences and serving your needs. But lurking behind this convenient facade is a growing concern: algorithmic harms.\n\nThese harms aren\u2019t obvious or immediate. They\u2019re insidious, building over time as AI systems quietly make decisions about your life without you even knowing it. The hidden power of these systems is becoming a significant threat to privacy, equality, autonomy and safety.\n\nAI systems are embedded in nearly every facet of modern life. They suggest what shows and movies you should watch, help employers decide whom they want to hire, and even influence judges to decide who qualifies for a sentence. But what happens when these systems, often seen as neutral, begin making decisions that put certain groups at a disadvantage or, worse, cause real-world harm?\n\nThe often-overlooked consequences of AI applications call for regulatory frameworks that can keep pace with this rapidly evolving technology. I study the intersection of law and technology, and I\u2019ve outlined a legal framework to do just that.\n\nSlow burns\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of algorithmic harms is that their cumulative impact often flies under the radar. These systems typically don\u2019t directly assault your privacy or autonomy in ways you can easily perceive. They gather vast amounts of data about people \u2014 often without their knowledge \u2014 and use this data to shape decisions affecting people\u2019s lives.\n\nSometimes, this results in minor inconveniences, like an advertisement that follows you across websites. But as AI operates without addressing these repetitive harms, they can scale up, leading to significant cumulative damage across diverse groups of people.\n\nConsider the example of social media algorithms. They are ostensibly designed to promote beneficial social interactions. However, behind their seemingly beneficial facade, they silently track users\u2019 clicks and compile profiles of their political beliefs, professional affiliations and personal lives. The data collected is used in systems that make consequential decisions \u2014 whether you are identified as a jaywalking pedestrian, considered for a job or flagged as a risk to commit suicide.\n\nWorse, their addictive design traps teenagers in cycles of overuse, leading to escalating mental health crises, including anxiety, depression and self-harm. By the time you grasp the full scope, it\u2019s too late \u2014 your privacy has been breached, your opportunities shaped by biased algorithms, and the safety of the most vulnerable undermined, all without your knowledge.\n\nThis is what I call \u201cintangible, cumulative harm\u201d: AI systems operate in the background, but their impacts can be devastating and invisible.\n\nWhy regulation lags behind\n\nDespite these mounting dangers, legal frameworks worldwide have struggled to keep up. In the United States, a regulatory approach emphasizing innovation has made it difficult to impose strict standards on how these systems are used across multiple contexts.\n\nCourts and regulatory bodies are accustomed to dealing with concrete harms, like physical injury or economic loss, but algorithmic harms are often more subtle, cumulative and hard to detect. The regulations often fail to address the broader effects that AI systems can have over time.\n\nSocial media algorithms, for example, can gradually erode users\u2019 mental health, but because these harms build slowly, they are difficult to address within the confines of current legal standards.\n\nFour types of algorithmic harm\n\nDrawing on existing AI and data governance scholarship, I have categorized algorithmic harms into four legal areas: privacy, autonomy, equality and safety. Each of these domains is vulnerable to the subtle yet often unchecked power of AI systems.\n\nThe first type of harm is eroding privacy. AI systems collect, process and transfer vast amounts of data, eroding people\u2019s privacy in ways that may not be immediately obvious but have long-term implications. For example, facial recognition systems can track people in public and private spaces, effectively turning mass surveillance into the norm.\n\nThe second type of harm is undermining autonomy. AI systems often subtly undermine your ability to make autonomous decisions by manipulating the information you see. Social media platforms use algorithms to show users content that maximizes a third party\u2019s interests, subtly shaping opinions, decisions and behaviors across millions of users.\n\nThe third type of harm is diminishing equality. AI systems, while designed to be neutral, often inherit the biases present in their data and algorithms. This reinforces societal inequalities over time. In one infamous case, a facial recognition system used by retail stores to detect shoplifters disproportionately misidentified women and people of color.\n\nThe fourth type of harm is impairing safety. AI systems make decisions that affect people\u2019s safety and well-being. When these systems fail, the consequences can be catastrophic. But even when they function as designed, they can still cause harm, such as social media algorithms\u2019 cumulative effects on teenagers\u2019 mental health.\n\nBecause these cumulative harms often arise from AI applications protected by trade secret laws, victims have no way to detect or trace the harm. This creates a gap in accountability. When a biased hiring decision or a wrongful arrest is made due to an algorithm, how does the victim know? Without transparency, it\u2019s nearly impossible to hold companies accountable.\n\nClosing the accountability gap\n\nCategorizing the types of algorithmic harms delineates the legal boundaries of AI regulation and presents possible legal reforms to bridge this accountability gap. Changes I believe would help include mandatory algorithmic impact assessments that require companies to document and address the immediate and cumulative harms of an AI application to privacy, autonomy, equality and safety \u2013 before and after it\u2019s deployed. For instance, firms using facial recognition systems would need to evaluate these systems\u2019 impacts throughout their life cycle.\n\nAnother helpful change would be stronger individual rights around the use of AI systems, allowing people to opt out of harmful practices and making certain AI applications opt in. For example, requiring an opt-in regime for data processing by firms\u2019 use of facial recognition systems and allowing users to opt out at any time.\n\nLastly, I suggest requiring companies to disclose the use of AI technology and its anticipated harms. To illustrate, this may include notifying customers about the use of facial recognition systems and the anticipated harms across the domains outlined in the typology.\n\nAs AI systems become more widely used in critical societal functions \u2013 from health care to education and employment \u2013 the need to regulate harms they can cause becomes more pressing. Without intervention, these invisible harms are likely to continue to accumulate, affecting nearly everyone and disproportionately hitting the most vulnerable.\n\nWith generative AI multiplying and exacerbating AI harms, I believe it\u2019s important for policymakers, courts, technology developers and civil society to recognize the legal harms of AI. This requires not just better laws, but a more thoughtful approach to cutting-edge AI technology \u2013 one that prioritizes civil rights and justice in the face of rapid technological advancement.\n\nThe future of AI holds incredible promise, but without the right legal frameworks, it could also entrench inequality and erode the very civil rights it is, in many cases, designed to enhance.\n\nSylvia Lu, Faculty Fellow and Visiting Assistant Professor of Law, University of Michigan\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "article_content": "Trend Micro Premium Security Suite MSRP $149.95 Score Details \u201cTrend Micro antivirus has a great track record of defending against online threats and offers several affordable price tiers.\u201d Pros Near perfect protection for 11 years\n\nQuick and helpful 24/7 support\n\nAffordable multidevice plans\n\nReasonable renewal cost Cons Free app lacks real-time protection\n\nTable of Contents Table of Contents Tiers and pricing Design Features Support Privacy and security Is Trend Micro right for you?\n\nHackers are learning new tricks so Trend Micro recently updated its antivirus packages with new features like AI app safeguards and browser notification scam protection. I tested the latest version to find out how it compares to the best antivirus software on the market.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nI researched Trend Micro\u2019s pricing, noting the features and coverage for each. Next, I reviewed its flagship Premium Security Suite, testing app usability, malware protection ratings, customer service, and more to help you decide whether it\u2019s the best solution for you.\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nTrend Micro has several price tiers, starting at $15 per year for the basic Antivirus+ subscription for one device. That\u2019s even more affordable than the least expensive Avast antivirus plan. It can scan for malware on your computer, block website threats, and alert you to scams.\n\nYou probably own more than one device, so a more expensive plan like the $35 Internet Security plan that covers three devices makes more sense. For $4 more annually, you can install Trend Micro Maximum Security on five computers and mobile devices.\n\nThe top tier is Trend Micro\u2019s Premium Security Suite. For $45 annually, it protects up to 10 devices. You get a VPN, $1 million in identity theft insurance, and 24/7 support.\n\nTrend Micro offers free 30-day trials of all four cybersecurity subscriptions, so you can ensure it suits your needs before committing.\n\nTrend Micro also offers HouseCall, a free virus scanner that checks if your computer is infected and clears active malware. However, it\u2019s not as effective as a full antivirus since it can\u2019t prevent malware until it\u2019s installed, potentially harvesting data and damaging your system.\n\nAVG offers a better free antivirus solution, offering real-time protection as well as malware cleanup for one device\n\nDesign\n\nWindows installation was quick and the app displayed a QR code to direct me to the iOS App Store or Play Store to get the mobile app and prompted me to install a Trend Micro browser extension.\n\nSwitching back to the app, I was greeted with a green checkmark showing I was protected from malware. I used the large green scan button to complete a quick scan to verify my computer wasn\u2019t infected.\n\nTrend Micro\u2019s dashboard is cleaner and friendlier than most antivirus apps. Above the central scan button, four tabs let me see device options like scheduled virus scans and PC health reviews, privacy checking, data protection, and parental controls.\n\nThe help and account menus are easy to access at the top right, and a gear to the right of the scan button lets me dig deeper into settings to fine-tune how the app works.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe most important part of antivirus software is how well it identifies threats and blocks them before personal data is at risk. I was impressed by Trend Micro\u2019s near-perfect track record in ongoing evaluations by independent cybersecurity lab AV-Test.\n\nTrend Micro antivirus earned six out of six in 59 of 69 test periods spanning 11 years. Zero-day attacks accounted for the 10 misses, which isn\u2019t a surprise since those are the hardest to block since there\u2019s no advance warning of the threat.\n\nAV-Test doesn\u2019t judge harshly for vulnerabilities of this type and Trend Micro received 5.5-star ratings on those occasions. Trend Micro\u2019s track record is almost as good as leading antivirus solutions like Norton and Bitdefender.\n\nI spot-checked Trend Micro Premium Security Suite by visiting Wicar.org, a malware test website. With my normal browser security disabled, I ran every test. Trend Micro\u2019s browser extension blocked all 13 malware downloads and browser hacks.\n\nSatisfied I was safe from viruses, I moved on to the other features. Trend Micro Premium Security Suite includes a premium VPN. I tried a server in the U.K. and the BBC\u2019s iPlayer thought I was a local.\n\nWhen antivirus software includes a VPN, it\u2019s rarely fast enough for the best quality streaming, but Trend Micro\u2019s VPN was quite fast, reaching a download speed of 343Mbps overseas. That\u2019s as fast as the best dedicated streaming VPNs.\n\nTrend Micro says its AI app protection feature prevents tampering with AI models. Another new feature identifies and blocks malicious browser notifications.\n\nOverall, Trend Micro Premium Security Suite is a very complete solution for privacy and security concerns, preventing viruses, protecting me from existing malware, and blocking a variety of threats.\n\nSupport\n\nTrend Micro offers phone support for all customers and 24/7 live chat support for Premium subscribers. I tried the chat option, and an AI quickly answered with useful information, demonstrating a good understanding of my question about the built-in VPN and providing a link to a support article for more details.\n\nI asked for a human anyway to check the responsiveness. I filled in my name and email address, then a live agent was immediately available to help.\n\nI asked about the difference between quick and full scans and learned the full scan looks for dormant malware as well as active threats. I was pleased with the prompt and helpful replies from both the chatbot and the live agent.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nTrend Micro is a well-known and trusted name in cybersecurity that\u2019s been protecting consumers from online threats for decades and helping businesses secure LANs before the internet began.\n\nThe terms and conditions indicate the company only uses your data to provide the service you pay for. For example, a Trend Micro privacy notice during installation suggested I shouldn\u2019t use the anti-spam, anti-scam, or password protection features if I wanted to opt out of data collection. These features require access to email contents and login details to provide more thorough protection.\n\nRegarding Trend Micro\u2019s internal security, I found a minor customer data breach in 2019 caused by a rogue employee who sold data from the support database. This affected less than 1% of all Trend Micro customers. Still, any leak of personal data is worth noting.\n\nI haven\u2019t noticed any increase in spam after using Trend Micro Premium Security Suite, and I trust the company to keep my data private.\n\nIs Trend Micro right for you?\n\nTrend Micro offers several tiers of protection, from a well-rated antivirus app for one computer to a full-featured cybersecurity suite that protects all your devices.\n\nFor malware prevention, Trend Micro earned a place among the best antivirus software available. The ease of use, friendly layout, and added features of the Premium Security Suite make it worth the extra investment.\n\nDespite the top protection performance and robust options, it\u2019s one of the least expensive and best values on antivirus software you can find. That said, there are often significant savings available from competitors, so check out the best deals on antivirus software if you\u2019re looking for a bargain."

            "article_content": "Dandadan has been nothing short of a masterpiece since the series dropped on Netflix and Crunchyroll in October 2024, instantly becoming a favorite amid a loaded season of other exceptional series. The anime adaptation of Yukinobu Tatsu\u2019s original manga has it all: high-octane shonen action, an adorable high school love story, surprisingly heartfelt moments, and perfect comedic timing. Since the story veers heavily into the paranormal, having the ability to break up intense moments with comedy is paramount.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nEpisode 9 of Dandadan, \u201cMerge! Serpo Dover Demon Nessie!\u201d proves just how great Science SARU has been handling the writing for the series, taking one of the manga\u2019s most infamous moments and elevating it way beyond the source material. In the episode, after Okarun, Aira, and Momo finally take down the Serpos \u2013 and Okarun and Momo finally clear the air about the Aira situation \u2013 the trio are sent back to the real world. Unfortunately for them, they lost their clothes in the battle and, upon returning home, were almost completely nude. Other students obviously take notice, and as Momo and Okarun run away, Aira joins them.\n\nWhile in any other show, this would have been rather unremarkable other than wrapping up a punchline, fans quickly noticed how Aira was running. The moment reminded fans of the show of another infamous moment from the anime adaptation of Attack on Titan, wherein a group of survivors hunker down, terrified, when a Titan crashes into the square, running in an anything but terrifying way.\n\nWIT Studio / Science Saru\n\nThe Iconic Running Titan Has a Way Of Making It Into (Almost) Every Major Anime\n\nMade popular due to how tonally jarring the Titan was when he originally appeared in Attack on Titan, Dandadan isn\u2019t the first anime to have this peculiar parallel noticed by fans. When Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead began airing in July 2023, fans noticed that in the show\u2019s very first episode when Akira discovers a zombified version of his boss and Saori together, the former runs at him in the same way as the Titan icon. The viral run cycle meme didn\u2019t originate from Attack on Titan, though, as any long-time or eagle-eyes anime fans have pointed out that this specific type of running is often associated with the age-old trope of an anime girl running late to school.\n\nThe trope was a staple in shoujo manga for decades before it started worming its way into other demographics. While the Titan and Aira\u2019s version of the run don\u2019t feature the \u201ctoast of tardiness,\u201d their frantic arm movements certainly deliver the same energy seen in more traditional takes on the trope like K-On!, Sailor Moon, and even Evangelion.\n\nH/T VishalSid on X, TV Tropes"

These vertical columns of light, mistaken for paranormal activity, are actually a natural optical illusion formed by ice crystals reflecting light under specific weather conditions\n\nRecently in Central Alberta, Canada, residents witnessed a beautiful spectacle of light pillars that illuminated the night sky during the winter. These columns of light appear to rise from the ground and stretch up into the dark, creating an ethereal visual spectacle. While many people are led to believe that these columns of light are paranormal, they are, in fact, a natural optical illusion that is created under specific weather conditions.\n\nThe Science Behind Light Pillars\n\nLight pillars are a phenomenon that is formed when the light sources like streetlights or building lights reflect off tiny hexagonal ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. The ice crystals are as small as 0.02 mm in diameter and function like mirrors. As light hits the ice crystals, it is reflected, giving the appearance of vertical columns shooting into the sky. The illusion can be almost magical, with beams of light soaring high above the ground to cast a shimmering glow over the dark sky.\n\nCheck out the visuals here\n\nLight pillar season has begun in Alberta, Canada \ud83d\udd38 Light pillars are caused by light reflecting off ice crystals suspended in the air. This phenomenon occurs in cold places where the temperature allows hexagonal ice crystals to form.

They are not associated with otherworldly or paranormal activity. Generally, the phenomenon is most common in colder climates, especially during the winter months when the temperatures plummet. Ideal conditions for light pillars include temperatures ranging from -10\u00b0C to -40\u00b0C, high humidity, and still air. Under these conditions, ice crystals form and reflect the light, thus creating this fantastic visual effect.\n\nAlberta, along with other cold regions like Russia and parts of Scandinavia, is an ideal location for witnessing this extraordinary natural wonder. While the light pillars may seem to originate directly from the light sources, they are actually an optical illusion, created by the reflection of light off the suspended ice crystals, often located high in the atmosphere.\n\nA Winter Marvel in Alberta\n\nFor those in Alberta, who have to bear the bitter cold, light pillars provide a moment of awe amidst the harsh winter conditions. Despite the freezing temperatures and biting wind-chill, the phenomenon offers a reminder of the mysterious beauty that nature can create. The stunning display transforms the icy winter landscape into a celestial wonder, providing residents and observers with an unforgettable winter experience.\n\nALSO READ: Rare First Edition Of Harry Potter Book \u2013 One Of Only 500 Copies \u2013 Sells For \u20b938 Lakh At UK Auction"

            "article_content": "Advertisement Discovery of fossilized footprints reveals the moment two ancient human species crossed paths Share Copy Link Copy\n\nMore than 1.5 million years ago, two different species of ancient humans crossed paths on a lakeshore, perhaps locking eyes with each other. These early forerunners of Homo sapiens wandered in a landscape teeming with wildlife, including giant maribou storks that stood 6.5 feet tall.A stunning discovery of fossilized footprints pressed into soft mud preserved the unexpected and extraordinary moment, suggesting that the two distinct types of hominin were able to live as neighbors sharing a habitat rather than as competitors who kept to their own territory.\"It's surprising that you would have two kinds of similarly sized, large-bodied hominin species on the same landscape,\" said Kevin Hatala, first author of a study on the footprints that published in the journal Science on Thursday.\"We see them in the very same lake margin environment, passing within this area within hours to a couple of days of one another. They probably would have been aware of each other's existence. They saw each other and they might have interacted,\" added Hatala, who is an associate professor of biology at Chatham University in Pittsburgh.The first part of the find occurred in July 2021 during an excavation at Koobi Fora, on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya, where the skeletal remains of several ancient human relatives have been found. That excavation revealed one hominin footprint, alongside several other tracks made by large birds. The team decided to rebury the tracks with fine sand until a detailed excavation was possible.The dig took place in 2022, when Hatala and his colleagues exposed 23 square meters (248 square feet) of sediment, revealing 11 more hominin tracks similar to the first in a line that suggested they were made by the same individual, plus three isolated footprints that were oriented in a perpendicular direction.The researchers also found 94 nonhuman tracks belonging to birds and cow- and horse-like animals. The largest bird track was 27 centimeters (10.6 inches) across and likely belong to a kind of giant stork known as Leptoptilos.\"There's one long trackway with 12 (hominin) footprints in it. It was made at a decent walking pace \u2026 especially since they were walking through mud. There's not a clear destination at the end,\" Hatala said.\"It's hard to say what exactly they were doing, but they walked in that perfect zone of mud,\" he said. \"If you think about the shoreline of a lake or a modern beach, you've got kind of a narrow zone where the mud is perfect for making footprints. If you move too far this way, it's too dry, if you move too far the other way, it's too wet. And they're walking almost like in a straight line through the perfect area for their footprints to be made, which is very lucky for us,\" he said.The three other footprints perpendicular to the trackway were scattered across the site. Hatala thinks they were made by three separate individuals, their other tracks perhaps wiped out by other animals walking around the surface at the same time.Pristinely preservedHatala and his colleagues couldn't directly date the footprints. But Hatala said the fossils were found below \u2014 and therefore were \"slightly older\" than \u2014 a layer of volcanic ash on the same site known as Elomaling'a Tuff, which has been dated to 1.52 million years ago, according to the study.However, the researchers said they are confident that the tracks were imprinted within hours to a few days of one another because there is no cracking on the surface of the footprints, which would be the case if they were exposed to air and dried under the sun for a longer period.Instead, the scientists said the prints were all pristinely preserved in a similar fashion under the accumulating strata of sediment, thanks to fine and silty sand that gently covered the tracks soon after they had formed.\"This was probably a delta system, with lots of shallow, low-energy water in this area and lots of nice muds,\" Hatala said.The term hominin refers to all species in the human family tree that emerged after the split from the ancestors of the great apes 6 million to 7 million years ago. This group includes more recently extinct species such as Neanderthals, which disappeared 40,000 years ago, and Australopithecus afarensis, represented by the famous Lucy skeleton in Ethiopia, which was 3.2 million years old.Homo sapiens, our own species, is the only living type of hominin, making the idea of encountering another species from the same lineage particularly tantalizing to imagine. The researchers found some clues as to which groups of ancient humans crossed paths during this encounter.Who did the footprints belong to?The team concluded that hominins belonging to the species Homo erectus and the smaller-brained Paranthropus boisei made the footprints. P. bosei made the long trackway, while Homo erectus made the other three footprints, the study suggested. The skeletal remains of both species have been found at the site.However, it wasn't immediately obvious that the footprints were made by two different species. Hatala, who is an expert in foot anatomy, determined they reflected different patterns of gait, stance and motion only after detailed 3D imaging and analysis.Through experiments in the field and in the lab, he compared the footprints with those made by living humans, including 59 of the Daasanach people in Ethiopia, who typically don't wear shoes, as well as other fossilized hominin prints and tracks made by chimpanzees.Hatala found that the 12-print trackway was made by an individual whose footprints didn't fall within the range of variation seen in Homo sapiens, unlike the three scattered footprints, which plotted more closely to those made by living humans.\"Homo erectus, from the neck down, they look very similar to modern humans, and within this time period, they are the best candidate for being a direct ancestor of ours. We hypothesize that those more humanlike footprints are more likely Homo erectus just because the rest of their anatomy is so human,\" Hatala said.\"Paranthropus boisei, they look quite different. Most of the fossils that are confidently attributed to them are skulls or teeth. They have very large jaws, very large teeth and large attachments for chewing muscles. It looks like they adapted to eating a very different kind of diet than Homo erectus,\" he said. Hatala explained that Bosei likely ate a plant-based diet, whereas Homo erectus was more of an omnivore.Hatala and his colleagues reviewed old fossil data from the site and found evidence the two species overlapped at the site for a significant period of time \u2014 perhaps over the course of 100,000 years, he said.\"That's exciting to see and to us that implies that direct competition between the two of them must have been relatively low, that they must have been OK with one another living on the same landscape. They weren't driving each other out,\" he said.\"It would have been a risky area, there would have been hippos, crocodiles, other sorts of dangerous animals that were living in those areas, too,\" Hatala added. \"So there must have been some appeal for both of them to go to those areas repeatedly over such a long time.\"The footprints are the first physical proof that different hominin species overlapped in exactly the same time and space, dodging predators and finding food in the ancient landscape, according to the study. Homo erectus went on to thrive for 1 million years more. Paranthropus boisei, however, went extinct within the next few hundred thousand years. Scientists don't know why.Briana Pobiner, a research scientist and museum educator at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's Human Origins Program, said it was \"mind-blowing\" to find footprints of not just one but two species walking in the same area.\"Maybe, they actively competed for the same food; maybe they just eyed each other warily from across a grassy patch. Maybe they ignored each other entirely,\" said Pobiner, who was not involved the new research.While it's the first time that footprints have suggested hominins of two species directly encountered one another, genetic evidence has revealed that Neanderthals interbred with Homo sapiens and Denisovans, a little understood hominin only known from a scant few fossils. Denisova Cave in Siberia was home to a girl who had a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father.Maybe, Pobiner said, P. boisei and H. erectus \"were similar enough that they even mated with each other on occasion.\"\"This finding tells us that they lived in the same place, at the same time, and walked around practically next to each other,\" she said.\"It's impossible to go back in time to actually observe these species 1.5 million years ago \u2014 but having both of their footprints on the same surface? That's the next best thing.\""

            "article_content": "The crypto market is buzzing as two standout ICOs, Flockerz (FLOCK) and BlockDAG (BDAG), dominate headlines.\n\nFlockerz has caught the attention of meme coin enthusiasts with its Vote-to-Earn concept, while BlockDAG is setting records with its Layer-1 blockchain technology and a presale fast approaching $150 million.\n\nAs the numbers roll in, it\u2019s clear that BlockDAG (BDAG) is pulling ahead and creating a frenzy like no other.\n\nFlockerz (FLOCK) ICO: Meme Coin Fun with a V2E Twist\n\nFlockerz is carving a niche in the meme coin market with its unique Vote-to-Earn (V2E) concept, giving holders the power to influence the project\u2019s future. This fresh approach has helped the presale cross $3.3 million, drawing in meme coin enthusiasts and staking fans alike. Flockerz pairs its playful branding with staking opportunities, aiming to deliver both entertainment and utility.\n\nDespite its momentum, the project\u2019s reliance on the saturated meme coin market raises questions about its scalability. While Flockerz has attracted attention, its niche focus may limit its ability to compete with more versatile projects like BlockDAG, which offers an infrastructure that supports meme coins and much more.\n\nBlockDAG (BDAG): Presale Powerhouse Breaking Records\n\nBlockDAG is dominating the presale space, setting new standards with its innovative Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. Designed to revolutionize blockchain scalability, speed, and decentralization, BlockDAG is capturing the attention of traders and developers alike.\n\nThe presale has raised an extraordinary $151 million, selling over 16.6 billion coins, with the current price of BDAG sitting at $0.0234 in batch 26. Early backers have already enjoyed an astonishing 2240% ROI, making BlockDAG one of the most lucrative opportunities of the year.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s success isn\u2019t limited to numbers\u2014it\u2019s about the ecosystem it\u2019s building. Through its low-code no-code platform, BlockDAG is positioning itself as the ultimate hub for meme coins, offering developers the tools and infrastructure to launch projects efficiently and scale seamlessly.\n\nThe excitement isn\u2019t just theoretical; in the past 48 hours alone, BlockDAG raised over $20 million, driven by significant whale activity that signals high confidence in its potential. For perspective, consider that while FLOCK\u2019s entire presale raised $3.3 million, a single whale on the BlockDAG platform has bought BDAG coins worth over $3.3 million.\n\nAs its Mainnet dev enters the audit phase, BlockDAG is gearing up for mass adoption, with projections of a market cap explosion post-listing. With a presale $151 million, analysts believe this project could surpass $600 million in funding soon, cementing its status as a blockchain leader.\n\nBlockDAG vs Flockerz ICO: Which Is Here to Stay?\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s (BDAG) and Flockerz\u2019s (FLOCK) ICOs highlight two vastly different approaches. Flockerz appeals to the meme coin crowd with its Vote-to-Earn model and community focus, while BlockDAG\u2019s scalable infrastructure is designed to redefine the entire crypto ecosystem.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s presale success is unmatched, with nearly $150 million raised and over 170,000 holders supporting its vision. By comparison, Flockerz\u2019s $3.3 million presale and 11,000 holders pale in scale and ambition. Traders are rallying behind BlockDAG for its potential to lead the crypto market, while Flockerz remains an interesting but limited player in the meme coin niche.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s BLACKFRIDAY150: A Limited-Time Window to Win Big\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s BLACKFRIDAY150 bonus has taken its presale frenzy to the next level. Offering a 150% bonus on all coin purchases, this deal exceeded trader holdings.\n\nAs the bonus ends on Monday, 2nd December, traders are racing to lock in their stakes before this opportunity disappears.\n\nIn Summary: Why BlockDAG is the Superior Choice\n\nIn the battle of BlockDAG (BDAG) vs Flockerz (FLOCK) ICO, BlockDAG emerges as the undisputed winner. Flockerz offers creativity and community appeal, but its $3.3 million presale can\u2019t compare to BlockDAG\u2019s staggering $151 million raised. The proven scalability of DAG technology and BlockDAG\u2019s role as a hub for meme coins give it a broader and more impactful vision.\n\nThe combination of whale confidence, record-breaking stats, and the time-sensitive BLACKFRIDAY150 bonus has made BlockDAG the hottest crypto presale of 2024. As the bonus comes to an end in just 2 days and the project inches closer to listing, traders are scrambling to secure their stake in what could be the next crypto giant."

            "article_content": "December is almost here, which means it is almost the start of the Advent season.\n\nWhile many equate Advent with calendars full of treats leading up to Christmas Day on Dec. 25, Advent is a term that comes out of Western Christianity and is the season encompassing the four Sundays (and the weekdays) leading up to the celebration of Christmas, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nAdvent started as a time for remembrance and a sign for Christians to be open and ready for the second coming of Christ and held to traditional items and events like a wreath with candles, a large feast at the end of the four Sundays and, of course, the Advent calendar.\n\nMany of the traditions around Advent have been adopted by mainstream culture as part of traditions for people who celebrate Christmas, especially the Advent calendar, which has taken a place in the holiday season for many whether they are Christian or not.\n\nHere's a look at the traditions some Christians uphold during this time of year and how some of those came to be mainstream.\n\nWhat is Advent?\n\nAdvent is the start of the Christian church's liturgical year. It starts four weeks ahead of Christmas, which usually is the last Sunday in November or the first Sunday of December. The start date changes every year.\n\nThe term Advent is from \"ad-venire\" in Latin and means \"to come to.\"\n\nThe Catholic church sees it as \"a time of preparation that directs our hearts and minds to Christ\u2019s second coming at the end of time and to the anniversary of Our Lord\u2019s birth on Christmas.\"\n\nDuring this time, the Christian faith has followers that reflect on scriptures of what they believe to be the second coming, but also a time for penance before Christmas with feasts, presents and more.\n\nWhen is Advent 2024?\n\nAdvent this year starts Sunday, Dec. 1, and runs through Christmas Eve on Tuesday, Dec. 24.\n\nWho celebrates Advent?\n\nWhile some of the traditions of Advent are seen leading up to the Christmas holiday, Advent itself is associated with Western Christianity. Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Episcopalians, Lutherans and many other Protestant churches mark the roughly month-long period with special observance.\n\nHow did we get Advent calendars?\n\nAdvent calendars were adopted at some point in the 19th century by German Lutherans as a way to mark the days of the season leading up to Christmas. Most of the time the days were marked by Bible readings or pieces from the Christian Christmas story.\n\nAs times changed, so did the Advent calendar.\n\nThere are now hundreds of Advent calendars available that don't always quite cover the days Advent is observed and usually start on Dec. 1. Calendars help to herald the arrival of Christmas by marking each day with something like a piece of candy, a small gift or even full-size products, depending on how much you want to spend.\n\nIn recent years, Advent calendars of every shape and size are available, from the ones you buy at the grocery store with a piece of chocolate each day to Advent calendars with makeup, Funko Pops and Squishmallows. Swarovski even has its own Advent calendar that sells for $1,200."

            "article_content": "Trend Micro Premium Security Suite MSRP $149.95 Score Details \u201cTrend Micro antivirus has a great track record of defending against online threats and offers several affordable price tiers.\u201d Pros Near perfect protection for 11 years\n\nQuick and helpful 24/7 support\n\nAffordable multidevice plans\n\nReasonable renewal cost Cons Free app lacks real-time protection\n\nTable of Contents Table of Contents Tiers and pricing Design Features Support Privacy and security Is Trend Micro right for you?\n\nHackers are learning new tricks so Trend Micro recently updated its antivirus packages with new features like AI app safeguards and browser notification scam protection. I tested the latest version to find out how it compares to the best antivirus software on the market.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nI researched Trend Micro\u2019s pricing, noting the features and coverage for each. Next, I reviewed its flagship Premium Security Suite, testing app usability, malware protection ratings, customer service, and more to help you decide whether it\u2019s the best solution for you.\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nTrend Micro has several price tiers, starting at $15 per year for the basic Antivirus+ subscription for one device. That\u2019s even more affordable than the least expensive Avast antivirus plan. It can scan for malware on your computer, block website threats, and alert you to scams.\n\nYou probably own more than one device, so a more expensive plan like the $35 Internet Security plan that covers three devices makes more sense. For $4 more annually, you can install Trend Micro Maximum Security on five computers and mobile devices.\n\nThe top tier is Trend Micro\u2019s Premium Security Suite. For $45 annually, it protects up to 10 devices. You get a VPN, $1 million in identity theft insurance, and 24/7 support.\n\nTrend Micro offers free 30-day trials of all four cybersecurity subscriptions, so you can ensure it suits your needs before committing.\n\nTrend Micro also offers HouseCall, a free virus scanner that checks if your computer is infected and clears active malware. However, it\u2019s not as effective as a full antivirus since it can\u2019t prevent malware until it\u2019s installed, potentially harvesting data and damaging your system.\n\nAVG offers a better free antivirus solution, offering real-time protection as well as malware cleanup for one device\n\nDesign\n\nWindows installation was quick and the app displayed a QR code to direct me to the iOS App Store or Play Store to get the mobile app and prompted me to install a Trend Micro browser extension.\n\nSwitching back to the app, I was greeted with a green checkmark showing I was protected from malware. I used the large green scan button to complete a quick scan to verify my computer wasn\u2019t infected.\n\nTrend Micro\u2019s dashboard is cleaner and friendlier than most antivirus apps. Above the central scan button, four tabs let me see device options like scheduled virus scans and PC health reviews, privacy checking, data protection, and parental controls.\n\nThe help and account menus are easy to access at the top right, and a gear to the right of the scan button lets me dig deeper into settings to fine-tune how the app works.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe most important part of antivirus software is how well it identifies threats and blocks them before personal data is at risk. I was impressed by Trend Micro\u2019s near-perfect track record in ongoing evaluations by independent cybersecurity lab AV-Test.\n\nTrend Micro antivirus earned six out of six in 59 of 69 test periods spanning 11 years. Zero-day attacks accounted for the 10 misses, which isn\u2019t a surprise since those are the hardest to block since there\u2019s no advance warning of the threat.\n\nAV-Test doesn\u2019t judge harshly for vulnerabilities of this type and Trend Micro received 5.5-star ratings on those occasions. Trend Micro\u2019s track record is almost as good as leading antivirus solutions like Norton and Bitdefender.\n\nI spot-checked Trend Micro Premium Security Suite by visiting Wicar.org, a malware test website. With my normal browser security disabled, I ran every test. Trend Micro\u2019s browser extension blocked all 13 malware downloads and browser hacks.\n\nSatisfied I was safe from viruses, I moved on to the other features. Trend Micro Premium Security Suite includes a premium VPN. I tried a server in the U.K. and the BBC\u2019s iPlayer thought I was a local.\n\nWhen antivirus software includes a VPN, it\u2019s rarely fast enough for the best quality streaming, but Trend Micro\u2019s VPN was quite fast, reaching a download speed of 343Mbps overseas. That\u2019s as fast as the best dedicated streaming VPNs.\n\nTrend Micro says its AI app protection feature prevents tampering with AI models. Another new feature identifies and blocks malicious browser notifications.\n\nOverall, Trend Micro Premium Security Suite is a very complete solution for privacy and security concerns, preventing viruses, protecting me from existing malware, and blocking a variety of threats.\n\nSupport\n\nTrend Micro offers phone support for all customers and 24/7 live chat support for Premium subscribers. I tried the chat option, and an AI quickly answered with useful information, demonstrating a good understanding of my question about the built-in VPN and providing a link to a support article for more details.\n\nI asked for a human anyway to check the responsiveness. I filled in my name and email address, then a live agent was immediately available to help.\n\nI asked about the difference between quick and full scans and learned the full scan looks for dormant malware as well as active threats. I was pleased with the prompt and helpful replies from both the chatbot and the live agent.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nTrend Micro is a well-known and trusted name in cybersecurity that\u2019s been protecting consumers from online threats for decades and helping businesses secure LANs before the internet began.\n\nThe terms and conditions indicate the company only uses your data to provide the service you pay for. For example, a Trend Micro privacy notice during installation suggested I shouldn\u2019t use the anti-spam, anti-scam, or password protection features if I wanted to opt out of data collection. These features require access to email contents and login details to provide more thorough protection.\n\nRegarding Trend Micro\u2019s internal security, I found a minor customer data breach in 2019 caused by a rogue employee who sold data from the support database. This affected less than 1% of all Trend Micro customers. Still, any leak of personal data is worth noting.\n\nI haven\u2019t noticed any increase in spam after using Trend Micro Premium Security Suite, and I trust the company to keep my data private.\n\nIs Trend Micro right for you?\n\nTrend Micro offers several tiers of protection, from a well-rated antivirus app for one computer to a full-featured cybersecurity suite that protects all your devices.\n\nFor malware prevention, Trend Micro earned a place among the best antivirus software available. The ease of use, friendly layout, and added features of the Premium Security Suite make it worth the extra investment.\n\nDespite the top protection performance and robust options, it\u2019s one of the least expensive and best values on antivirus software you can find. That said, there are often significant savings available from competitors, so check out the best deals on antivirus software if you\u2019re looking for a bargain."
