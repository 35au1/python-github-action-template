In short Elon Musk suggests that UFO sightings could be the result of classified US government projects testing new aircraft or missiles, rather than evidence of extraterrestrial life.\n\nHe assures that if he ever discovers proof of alien life, he will immediately share it.\n\nMusk also speculates that if the government knew about aliens, they might portray them as threats to justify increased military spending. Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nMusk said he has not seen any evidence of aliens\n\nElon Musk believes UFO sightings are US government's secret weapons\n\nBy Mudit Dube 04:46 pm Oct 09, 202404:46 pm\n\nWhat's the story SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has weighed in on the recent spate of unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings in the United States. Speaking to political commentator and journalist Tucker Carlson, he argued that these UFOs aren't proof of extraterrestrial life but rather classified \"new weapons programs\" being tested by the US government. Even though he heads his own company, Space Exploration Technologies, Musk said he has \"not seen any evidence of aliens.\"\n\nAlien existence\n\nMusk questions existence of aliens amid numerous satellites\n\nMusk emphasized the fact that there are more than \"6,000 satellites\" in orbit around Earth, and none of them have ever had to dodge an alien spacecraft. He made the observation when Carlson asked him about the reports of US military regularly encountering unexplained objects. \"Well, unidentified flying objects are one thing, but there are always a bunch of classified programs that are underway,\" Musk said.\n\nClassified projects\n\nMusk suggests classified projects behind unexplained sightings\n\nMusk proposed the government could be testing \"new aircraft, new missiles, and things\" under highly classified programs. He said these tests could be so secretive that even high-ranking military officials may not be aware of them. This could explain why pilots report seeing fast-moving objects they can't identify, leading to increased UFO sightings.\n\nDisclosure promise\n\nMusk promises to disclose any evidence of extraterrestrial life\n\nMusk assured that if he ever finds evidence of alien life, he won't keep it a secret. He promised to share any such evidence immediately on the X platform, predicting it would probably be their most popular post ever. The promise is in line with his earlier statements where he hoped for friendly extraterrestrial beings and doubted government cover-ups about their existence.\n\nGovernment response\n\nMusk's views on government's potential response to alien existence\n\nPreviously, Musk had suggested that if the government knew about aliens, it would probably depict them as threats to justify more military spending. This perspective was shared in the context of a 2023 report that failed to confirm any recent alien sightings by service members as extraterrestrial life. The report prompted Congress to direct the Pentagon to examine its UFO files dating back to the end of World War II."

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nDatabricks just made app development a piece of cake. The Ali Ghodsi-led company announced Databricks Apps, a capability that allows enterprise developers to quickly build production-ready data and AI applications in a matter of clicks.\n\nAvailable in public preview today, the service provides users with a template-based experience, where they can connect relevant data and frameworks of choice into a fully functional app that could run within their respective Databricks environment.\n\nAccording to the company, it can be used to create and deploy a secure app in as little as five minutes.\n\nThe announcement comes at a time when enterprises, despite being bullish on the potential of data-driven applications, continue to struggle with the operational hassle of the entire development cycle, right from provisioning the right infrastructure to ensuring security and access control of the developed app.\n\nWhat to expect from Databricks Apps?\n\nMuch like Snowflake, Databricks has long provided its customers the ability to build apps powered by their data hosted on the company\u2019s platform. Users can already build applications such as interactive dashboards to delve into specific insights or sophisticated AI-driven systems like chatbots or fraud detection programs.\n\nHowever, no matter what one chooses to develop, the process of bringing a reliable app to production in a secure and governed manner is not an easy one.\n\nThe developers have to go beyond writing the app to handle several critical aspects of the development pipeline, right from provisioning and managing infrastructure and ensuring data governance and compliance to manually bolting integrations for access controls and defining who could use the app and who could not. This often makes the whole development process complex and time-consuming.\n\n\u201cApp authors had to become familiar with container hosting technologies, implement single sign-on authentication, configure service principals and OAuth, and configure networking. The apps they created relied on integrations that were brittle and difficult to manage,\u201d Shanku Niyogi, the VP of product management at Databricks, tells VentureBeat.\n\nTo change this, the company is now bringing everything to one place with the new Databricks Apps experience.\n\nWith this offering, all a user has to do is select a Python framework from a set of options (Streamlit/Dash/Gradio/Flask), a template of the type of app they want to develop (chatbot or data visualization app) and configure a few basic settings, including those for mapping resources (like data warehouses or LLMs) and defining permissions.\n\nOnce the basic setup is done, the app is deployed to the user\u2019s Databricks environment, allowing them to use it themselves or share it with others in the team. When others log in, the app automatically prompts them with single sign-on authentication. Further, if needed, the developer will also get the option to customize the developed app and test their app code in their preferred IDE (integrated development environment).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/databricks/status/1843639454596247664\n\nOn the backend, Niyogi explained, the service provisions serverless compute to run the app, ensuring not only faster deployment but also that the data does not leave the Databricks environment.\n\n\u201cEach app is fortified with robust security measures for seamless and secure user access. Plus, the integration with Unity Catalog provides comprehensive data governance and management capabilities, while the apps inherit the networking protections of your workspace, ensuring a multi-layered security approach for your sensitive data and applications,\u201d he explained.\n\nAt this stage, Databricks Apps only supports Python frameworks. However, Niyogi noted that the company is working to expand to more tools, languages and frameworks, making secure app creation easier for everyone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started with Python, the #1 language for data. Anyone familiar with a Python framework can write their app in code, and anyone with an existing app can onboard it into Databricks Apps easily. We support any Python IDE. We are working with ISV partners to enable their tools to support Databricks Apps, and add support for other languages and frameworks,\u201d he added.\n\nSome 50 enterprises have already tested Databricks Apps in beta, including Addi, E.ON Digital Technology, SAE International, Plotly and Posit. With the public preview launching today, the number is expected to grow in the coming months.\n\nNotably, Snowflake, Databricks\u2019 biggest competitor, also has a low-code way to help enterprises develop and deploy data and AI apps.\n\nHowever, Databricks claims to distinguish itself with a more flexible and interoperable approach.\n\n\u201cDatabricks Apps supports Dash, Gradio, Flask, and Shiny as well as Streamlit, and supports more versions of Streamlit than Snowflake does. Developers can also use their choice of tools to build apps. We will continue to build on this flexible approach, adding support for more languages, frameworks and tools,\u201d Niyogi pointed out."

        "article_content": "Adobe Content Authenticity, a free web app that allows users to easily add content credentials as well as artificial intelligence (AI) labels, was introduced on Tuesday. The platform is aimed at helping creators with their attribution needs. It works on images, videos, and audio files and is integrated with all of the Adobe Creative Cloud apps. Alongside adding attribution, creators can also use the platform to opt out of training AI models using their content. It is currently available as a Google Chrome extension in beta.\n\nAdobe Content Authenticity Web App Introduced\n\nIn a newsroom post, Adobe detailed the new platform. Notably, while it is available as a Chrome extension currently, a free web app will be available in public beta in the first quarter of 2025. Users can sign up here to be notified when the beta is available to download. The company highlighted that the platform is aimed at \u201chelping creators protect their work from misuse or misrepresentation and build a more trustworthy and transparent digital ecosystem for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe app will act as a one-stop shop for all the attribution needs of creators. They can use it to add Content Credentials, which is the information added to a file's metadata highlighting details about its creator. The app can be used to add these attributions to a batch of files. Creators can also choose the information they want to share and it can include their name, website, and social media accounts.\n\nAdobe said that Content Credentials can protect creators from unauthorised use or misattribution of their work. Interestingly, while the web app supports all the Adobe Creative Cloud apps, content not created on its platform can also be attributed. This goes for images, videos, and audio files.\n\nApart from attribution, the web app will also let users mark if they do not want their content to be used by or to train AI models. The company highlighted that it only trains Adobe Firefly, the in-house family of generative AI models, on content which is either publicly available or has permission to use. However, adding the AI label will also protect the creator from other AI models in the market.\n\nHowever, that will only work if other companies decide to respect Content Credentials. Currently, only Spawning, the opt-out aggregator of generative AI, has committed to recognise this attribution. Adobe said it is actively working to drive an industry-wide adoption of this preference. Unfortunately, there is a downside. If a creator does not allow their work to be used for AI training, the content will not be eligible for Adobe Stock."

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)\n\nIf scientists can better understand how they work and how to manipulate them, it could one day lead to powerful treatments for diseases like cancer.\n\nThe work by Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun is \u201cproving to be fundamentally important for how organisms develop and function,\u201d according to a panel that awarded the prize in Stockholm.\n\nAmbros and Ruvkun were initially interested in genes that control the timing of different genetic developments, ensuring that cell types develop at the right time.\n\nTheir discovery ultimately \u201crevealed a new dimension to gene regulation, essential for all complex life forms,\u201d the panel said.\n\nWhat is the Nobel Prize for?\n\nRNA is best known for carrying instructions for how to make proteins from DNA in the nucleus of the cell to tiny cellular factories that actually build the proteins. MicroRNA does not make proteins, but helps to control what cells are doing, including switching on and off critical genes that make proteins.\n\nLast year\u2019s Nobel for medicine went to scientists who discovered how to manipulate one of those types of RNA, known as messenger RNA or mRNA, now used to make vaccines for COVID-19.\n\nAmbros\u2019 and Ruvkun\u2019s revolutionary discovery was initially made in worms; they set out to identify why some kinds of cells didn\u2019t develop in two mutant strains of worms commonly used as a research model in science.\n\n\u201cTheir groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans,\u201d according to the citation explaining the importance of their work.\n\nThat mechanism has been at work for hundreds of millions of years and has enabled evolution of complex organisms, it said.\n\nAmbros, currently a professor of natural science at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, performed the research at Harvard University. Ruvkun\u2019s research was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, where he\u2019s a professor of genetics.\n\nWhy does microRNA matter?\n\nThe study of microRNA has opened up approaches to treating diseases like cancer because it helps regulate how genes work in our cells, said Dr. Claire Fletcher, a lecturer in molecular oncology at Imperial College London.\n\nFletcher said there were two main areas where microRNA could be helpful: in developing drugs to treat diseases and in serving as possible indicators of diseases, by tracking microRNA levels in the body.\n\n\u201cIf we take the example of cancer, we\u2019ll have a particular gene working overtime, it might be mutated and working in overdrive,\u201d said Fletcher. She said scientists might one day be able to use microRNA to stop such effects.\n\nEric Miska, a geneticist at Cambridge University, said the discovery by Ambros and Ruvkun came as a complete surprise, overturning what scientists had long understood about how cells work.\n\nTheir discovery of microRNA shocked many scientists, Miska said, explaining that such small bits of genetic material had never been seen before. The tiny fragments of RNA \u2014 the human genome has at least 800 \u2014 were later found to play critical roles in how our bodies develop.\n\nMiska said there is ongoing work on the role of microRNA in infectious diseases like hepatitis and that it might also be helpful in treating neurological diseases.\n\nFletcher said the most advanced studies to date are reviewing how microRNA approaches might help treat skin cancer, but no drugs have yet been approved. She predicted that might happen in the coming years, adding that most treatments at the moment target cell proteins.\n\n\u201cIf we can intervene at the microRNA level, it opens up a whole new way of us developing medicines,\u201d she said.\n\nHow did Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros react?\n\nThe phone call from the Nobel panel is often a surprise, but there are certain signs that recipients and their families pick up on.\n\n\u201cWell, when a phone rings at 4:30 in the morning. \u2026 It never happens here,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\n\u201cNatasha actually answered it,\u201d Ruvkun added, referring to his wife. \u201cAnd she goes: \u2018He has a Swedish accent.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt took a little longer to rouse Ambros.\n\n\u201cSomebody called my son, who called my wife as my phone was downstairs,\u201d he said.\n\nRuvkun knew immediately the impact the award would have on his life.\n\n\u201cWell, I just kept repeating in my mind, this changes everything because you know, the Nobel is just mythic in how it transforms the life of people who are selected,\u201d Ruvkun said. \u201cThe Nobel Prize is a recognition that\u2019s sort of 100 times as much press and celebration as any other award. So, it\u2019s not part of a continuum. It\u2019s a quantum leap.\u201d\n\nGoing to pick up his award in December will be the third time he has been to a Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm after attending to watch his mentor Robert Horvitz receive the 2002 award and then his buddy Jack Szostak, who won in 2009.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a trip coming up. It will be the third, possibly the best,\u201d Ruvkun said.\n\nAmbros said he didn\u2019t expect the award as he felt that the Nobel committee has already singled out RNA in the 2006 prize that went to his friends Andrew Fire and Craig Mello.\n\n\u201cIt represents the recognition of how wonderful and unexpected discoveries come from a curiosity in basic science financed by taxpayer money. It\u2019s a vitally important, probably the most important message, that this investment really pays off,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine went to Hungarian-American Katalin Karik\u00f3 and American Drew Weissman for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 that were critical in slowing the pandemic.\n\nThe prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the prize\u2019s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel.\n\nNobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday, chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on Oct. 14.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify that microRNA helps regulate gene activity, rather than carrying instructions for making proteins.\n\n___\n\nCorder reported from The Hague, Netherlands, Cheng reported from London.

        "article_content": "The ancient graves were found in the basement of a house in a southern suburb of Paris that is thought to have been built on the site of a medieval chapel.\n\nDuring a basement renovation project, a homeowner near Paris unexpectedly unearthed a skeleton. The discovery eventually led to the excavation of a cemetery where dozens of people were buried, some of them up to 1,700 years ago.\n\nThe oldest grave dates from the third century A.D., during the Late Roman period ; and 10 plaster sarcophagi date from the early Merovingian period of Frankish rule, which lasted from roughly 476 to 750.\n\nThe most recent grave dates to about the 10th century, which indicates that the cemetery was in use for about 700 years.\n\nArchaeologists originally thought the site was an early medieval graveyard because a seventh-century chapel had once stood in the area. So the existence of even older graves was unexpected, according to a translated statement from the French archaeology company Archaeodunum , which is carrying out the excavations on behalf of regional authorities.\n\nThe homeowner found the first grave this past winter, and archaeologists have now unearthed 38 graves there in a four-room area covering 560 square feet (52 square meters).\n\nRelated: Ancient necropolis unearthed just feet away from bustling Paris train station\n\nImage 1 of 3 The first skeleton was found in the basement of the house by the homeowner during renovations several months ago.

(Image credit: Archeodunum) Many of the graves date from the Merovingian period from the fifth to the eighth centuries. The dead at this time were placed in plaster sarcophagi. (Image credit: Archeodunum)\n\nMedieval chapel\n\nThe house in the Montconseil district of Corbeil-Essonnes, a commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, is thought to have been built at the site of the medieval Notre-Dame-des-Champs chapel, which in turn is said to have been built above an even older pagan temple honoring a spring.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

This is the first time that the chapel's cemetery has been studied, according to the statement.\n\nAlthough the basement site included several outcrops of rock, most of the graves were arranged in parallel rows. The dead from the Roman period had been buried on their backs in wooden enclosures that have since rotted away. But the 10 dead people in the Merovingian graves were buried in distinctive plaster sarcophagi, arranged side by side in a fan-shape, the statement said.\n\nOne sarcophagus was originally covered by a shaped stone block, now in pieces, that seems to have had a rosette and two crosses carved into its surface. The archaeologists said such motifs were common on Merovingian sarcophagi, as well as outside places of Christian worship at this time.\n\nImage 1 of 2 Archaeologists have now found the graves of 38 people in the four-room basement. Other burials had previously been found nearby. (Image credit: Archeodunum) One of the Merovingian sarcophagi was covered with a stone block that is now in pieces. It was carved with the emblem of a rosette and two types of crosses. (Image credit: Archeodunum)\n\nAncient burials\n\nMerovingian sarcophagi from other sites are sometimes decorated and often contain the remains of several people. But most of the sarcophagi at Corbeil were undecorated and each held only the remains of a single person, the statements said.\n\nThe age of the oldest graves indicate that people were buried at the site long before the medieval chapel was built there.\n\nThe skeletons will now be analyzed in a laboratory. The archaeologists hope to determine the sexes and ages of the buried people and any indications of their living conditions, the statement said, such as their health at death and their general diet.\n\nThe archaeologists hope the burial ground will give them a better understanding of the population that lived near the site during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and how their funeral traditions changed over time."

This operation carried out with the French Tech Seed funds, managed on behalf of the State by Bpifrance as part of France 2030, IRDI Investment Capital, Xplore By \u00c9pop\u00e9e Gestion and EuroBIM, will allow the company to accelerate the development of its offer, to strengthen its presence in France and internationally and to recruit new talents.\n\nA unique innovation in the world to meet the energy efficiency needs of electronic chips\n\nGeneral-purpose processors are omnipresent on the market. Offering great versatility, they equip all types of electronic devices, from IoT to the automotive world. Capable of handling a multitude of tasks, these \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d products are the default solution for manufacturers in a hurry to position themselves on the market. However, this general approach presents significant limits in terms of cost, energy efficiency and performance: 50% of the functionalities will never be used during the life of the processor. Well aware of these obstacles, more and more players wish to turn to personalized chips, but are faced with excessively slow and costly development cycles.\n\nA true catalyst for innovation, Keysom responds to this challenge and allows manufacturers to design a tailor-made processor in the space of a few simple and rapid iterations, without any constraints linked to inherent technical development. To this end, with a highly qualified technical team, Keysom devoted 4 years of R&D to develop Keysom Studio, its intelligent and easy-to-use tool capable of exploring, testing, modifying and optimizing a very wide variety of complex architectures in order to arrive at a unique solution each time, entirely adapted to the customer\u2019s needs \u2013 without the need for advanced technical skills or a team of experts.\n\nKeysom thus opens a new era for manufacturers, putting within their reach the design of more efficient, more economical and more ecological tailor-made processors, on both a small and large scale. The launch of this solution marks a turning point for all companies seeking agility and competitiveness.\n\n\u201cWhere manufacturers pay for oversized generic processors, which generate costs and energy waste, a custom processor uses less raw material (in this case silicon), leading to lower production costs and simplified manufacturing processes. In a context where demand for semiconductors continues to increase, reducing the silicon area per chip is a major strategic advantage. Our software allows to explore up to 12 million processor combinations to achieve this.\u201d confides Luca Testa \u2013 Co-founder & Director of Operations of Keysom\n\nRaising \u20ac4M to accelerate sales on an international scale\n\nSupported by the French Tech Seed funds, managed on behalf of the State by Bpifrance as part of France 2030, IRDI Investment Capital, Xplore by \u00c9pop\u00e9e Gestion and EuroBIM, Keysom has just completed a \u20ac4M fundraising. This funding round marks a decisive step for Keysom, thus anchoring its position as a technological pioneer in the field of custom processor design.\n\n\u201cThis fundraising is an important milestone in our growth strategy. It gives us the means to further accelerate the development of our technology and lead our commercial expansion into new markets. We firmly believe that our no code tool will redefine the way manufacturers approach the design and optimization of their systems. \u00bb adds Cyril Sagonero \u2013 President of Keysom\n\nPart of the funds will be dedicated to the recruitment of new R&D technical experts, in order to continue to innovate and improve the performance of hardware and software solutions, as well as to the recruitment of qualified commercial profiles. With the support of its investors, Keysom aspires to continue offering solutions that transform the industry while keeping in mind the democratization of the access to high-tech tools for as many people as possible.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the State, Bpifrance actively participates in the reindustrialization of France and works for the sovereignty of the country by supporting companies in strategic sectors. We are happy to be alongside the deeptech company Keysom, whose talented teams and custom processor design technology promise a real revolution in industrial electronics. \u00bb adds Fran\u00e7ois Charbonnier, Investment Director at Bpifrance.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to support the Keysom team in this kick-off sales phase because we are convinced that Keysom makes it possible to provide an innovative, sovereign solution with a limited carbon impact to industrial players, many of whom need processors. \u00bb Camille Le Roux Larsabal, VC Associate at Epop\u00e9e Gestion.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the elements already cited by my colleagues \u2013 disruptive innovation, technical excellence and environmental impact \u2013 I would add that Keysom is a company with strong local roots, in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region. We are convinced that the managers have all the qualities to make this startup an important player both locally and internationally. \u00bb Vincent Brousse, Investment Director at IRDI Investment Capital.\n\nAbout Keysom\n\nIn 2019, Cyril Sagonero and Luca Testa are beginning to question the market approach of buying off-the-shelf processors in order to reduce time to market. The waste of area and energy consumption is huge. At the same time, version 2.2 of the RISC-V ISA is frozen, opening the door to this new ISA to the industry. The following year, discussions with PhD J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Crenne of the University of Bordeaux and software architecture expert Fabrice Bonnet laid the foundations for Keysom, a French startup which aims to enable semiconductor companies to automatically and simply obtain the RISC-V processor best suited to their needs. In 2022 Keysom is developing the world\u2019s first coding-free tool dedicated to the design of custom processors.\n\nAbout Bpifrance and the French Tech Seed fund:\n\nBpifrance finances companies \u2013 at each stage of their development \u2013 \u200b\u200bwith credit, guarantees and equity. Bpifrance supports them in their innovation projects and internationally. Bpifrance also ensures their export activity through a wide range of products. Consulting, university, networking and acceleration program for start-ups, SMEs and mid-sized companies are also part of the offer presented to entrepreneurs.\n\nThanks to Bpifrance and its 50 regional locations, entrepreneurs benefit from a close, unique and efficient contact to help them face their challenges.\n\nEndowed with 500 million euros, the French Tech Seed Fund aims to support fundraising by innovative start-ups and VSEs less than 3 years old carrying out technologically intensive innovation. Resulting from the Future Investment Program (PIA), now integrated into France 2030 and operated on behalf of the State by Bpifrance, the fund is based on certified business providers, responsible for identifying and qualifying these young companies and put them in touch with private investors. These business providers, ensuring the technological validity of the project, will allow public investment, in the form of Convertible Bonds of up to 400 million euros, in addition to the capital provided by private investors. 100 million euros are also dedicated to equity investments in addition to the conversion of Convertible Bonds.\n\nMore info on: www.Bpifrance.fr \u2013 https://presse.bpifrance.fr / \u2013 Follow-us on X (formerly Twitter): @Bpifrance \u2013 @BpifrancePresse\n\nAbout IRDI Investment Capital\n\nIRDI Investment Capital has been one of the leaders in regional investment capital for 40 years.
