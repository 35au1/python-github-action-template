        "article_content": "With all the horrifying moments in Silent Hill 2 Remake, it is nice that the two classic joke endings from the original game. One of these endings is the \u201cUFO\u201d Ending which is a running joke that has appeared in many of the series\u2019 entries. While this version of the UFO Ending is slightly different from the original, players will still want to know how to reach this humorous conclusion. This guide will show players how to get the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake.\n\nMore Silent Hill 2 Remake Guides\n\nFull Achievement and Trophy List | How Long Is Silent Hill 2 Remake? | How To Get All Guns & Special Weapons | How to Get the Handgun | How to Get the Shotgun | How to Get the Hunting Rifle | Pyramid Head Boss Fight Guide | Flesh Lip Boss Fight Guide | Abstract Daddy Boss Fight Guide | Eddie Boss Fight Guide | Dual Pyramid Heads Boss Fight Guide | Final Boss Fight Guide | All Number Locks & Keypad Solutions | How To Unlock Every Classic Ending | Secrets Guide | How To Unlock Two New Secret Endings\n\nHow to Get the \u201cUFO\u201d Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake\n\nTo get the UFO Ending, you will first need to beat the game at least once and then go through it all again in New Game+. During New Game+, new items will appear throughout the game, including special ones that are required to get special endings like the UFO one.\n\nYou will need to use the Blue Gem item at designated locations to get the UFO ending. This Gem is found just a little north of the top right corner of Katz and Nathan Street on the east side of South Vale. Look for the blue awning that says \u201cJEWELLERS.\u201d Break the left window to pick up the Blue Gem.\n\nNow, progress through the game as normal but make sure to stop at specific locations and then inspect the Blue Gem. The first location is on the roof of the Saul Street Apartments which you will go to when you are getting the Jukebox button. When you inspect the Gem in the right location, it will glow which means you have successfully checked off the location you are currently at.\n\nThe next place you need to use the Blue Gem is the pier of Rosewater Park.\n\nGet all the way to the start of the Lakeview Hotel section of the game. After getting off the boat used to get across Toluca Lake, use the Gem while on the dock to get it to glow.\n\nMake your way through all of the Lakeview Hotel until you complete the Lakeview Hotel Music Box Puzzle and can now go to Room 312. Instead of putting the Video Tape in the VCR, use the Blue Gem on the left window. This will immediately begin the UFO Ending.\n\nAliens will descend down but it won\u2019t just be them. It isn\u2019t Harry from Silent Hill 1 that gets off the fly saucer-like in the original game, but instead the PlayStation 2 version of James. he tells Remake James that he is nothing but a clone and it\u2019s time to take him home. An alien knocks Remake James out as the creature and PS2 James takes him aboard their spacecraft.\n\nYou can now get the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake. Stay tuned to Gameranx for more news, updates, and guides for Silent Hill 2 Remake as well as other great games in the future."

Gribble, keeps records of sightings around the globe. Since 1995, the centre has kept sighting reports on its website.\n\nBeyond the explained sightings of comets or northern lights, Unidentified Flying Objects are just that, unexplained objects spotted in the sky. Recently, scientists are using the acronym \u201cUAP\u201d (Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon) for unexplainable sights or phenomena. NASA established a team in 2022 to study UAP.\n\nIn Canada, Ontario has the highest number of reports at 2,562 in the National UFO Reporting Center database. British Columbia is next with 1,226. Toronto has the highest number of sightings in 2024.\n\nThese numbers are likely due to the population. Ontario has the highest population in Canada at 16,124,116, according to Statistics Canada. British Columbia is next at 5,698,430.\n\nToronto, with a population of 6,431,000 in 2024, has had six UFO sightings reported to the National UFO Reporting Center in 2024.\n\nIn September, someone reported a \u201cnear stationary white changing object\u201d in the city and in July another report indicated there was an \u201coval craft\u201d that floated at an almost helicopter level.\n\nOther reports in the GTA include a recent sighting in Mississauga. On Oct. 10, someone reported and egg-shaped object following an aircraft on a final approach to Pearson Airport.\n\nOn Aug. 31, a person in Burlington claimed to see nine craft that appeared as dots in a delta formation.\n\nThere was a report of an \u201cextremely large triangle\u201d over Clarington on Aug. 29.\n\nIn April, someone spotted a \u201cwhite ball moving very fast \u2013 too fast for a satellite\u201d in Milton.\n\nWhile often ridiculed, UFO sightings are part of Canada\u2019s history.\n\nLast month, The Royal Canadian Mint announced a coin commemorating one of Canada\u2019s most notable UFO sightings. The Langenburg Event, as it came to be known, was a sighting on Sept. 1, 1974 near the town of Langenburg, Saskatchewan.\n\nA farmer reported five saucer-shaped objects hovering just above the ground. He watched as they rose up, emitting a strange vapour and then disappeared into the sky. The RCMP investigated and the incident report noted \u201cfive different distinct circles, caused by something exerting what had to be heavy air or exhaust pressure over the highgrass.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the National UFO Reporting Center, see the website here."

        "article_content": "The surge of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has contributed to unprecedented demand on datacentre infrastructure.\n\nExisting facilities are no longer fit for purpose and AI-ready capacity is in short supply, exacerbated by the existing demand from hyperscalers and cloud providers.\n\nHyperscaler providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft, already consume the vast majority of datacentre capacity in Europe, and are looking to secure even more space to support the expansion of their digital services and outpace competitors. This is increasing the pressure on datacentre developers to increase supply across Europe.\n\nAI technologies, particularly generative AI, require significantly more power than traditional datacentre workloads. For example, the development of an AI training model that looks at thousands of faces to learn what a nose should look like, requires more computational power and energy than a traditional computing environment. In addition, the rising uptake of AI across countries, industries, and functions, is rapidly increasing demand for datacentre space.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) believes AI-powered web searches will boost electricity demand tenfold. By 2026, the IEA expects total datacentre electricity demand to increase from approximately 460 TWh in 2022 to over 1,000 TWh.\n\nDesigning datacentres for AI Datacentre design is also evolving to accommodate AI workloads, due to the need for more processing power compared to generic forms of computing. This generates more heat, which requires a radically different approach to cooling. Datacentre operators are having to redesign their infrastructure to include liquid cooling, to ensure they can handle the higher power densities required for AI technology. This includes installing direct-to-chip or immersed solutions. Datacentres like this will need larger dedicated areas to house the advanced cooling equipment. Given this complexity, many operators are choosing to build completely new liquid-cooled datacentres from scratch. In Europe\u2019s metro markets, where most colocation datacentres are found, there is a lack of power available. This is due to limited grid capacity, sustainability, and political pressure, as datacentre operators compete with residential developers and other commercial users for power. Additionally, the availability of land that\u2019s within easy reach of high-speed network connectivity and within reasonable proximity of datacentres where they have let space is limited. Consequently, where land with power and network is available, it is at a premium and datacentre operators are also looking further afield to find suitable locations. Providers are struggling to keep pace with the demand for datacentre capacity from hyperscalers and cloud providers, and this trend is being exacerbated by the demand from next generation AI. As a result, available datacentre space has plummeted in the largest cities of Europe.\n\nCan the surge in AI demand be accommodated? Existing colocation facilities can to an extent support AI workloads if they can be retrofitted with specialised hardware and cooling equipment. But if, as expected, the use of AI continues to grow, new datacentre capacity will be required to fulfil the demand. This is unlikely to happen at scale in the traditional markets of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin, because power and land availability is increasingly hard to find. To accommodate the requirements created by AI, the industry\u2019s development strategy will have to change. Datacentre operators will need to look outside the European metro markets when seeking locations to develop new capacity. This will lead to the development of smaller, secondary markets in countries such as the UK or France (e.g. Marseille or Lyon), where there may be more power and land available for datacentre purposes. In the UK, this development trend is accelerating, which is encouraging investors, hyperscalers, and datacentre providers to purchase land for AI-ready data centre development. We estimate that at present 56% of the country\u2019s colocation datacentres are located within 30 miles of London, although operators are shifting their focus outside the capital. For example, the datacentre operator Virtus has announced that it has purchased land in Saunderton, north west of London, where they plan to deliver 75MW of capacity for AI applications. Lower latency connectivity will become more important for datacentre providers as inference AI is rolled out given the need to deliver services to users. In the meantime, equipment that powers AI training models are being implemented in datacentres; inference AI is expected to follow."

        "article_content": "The first dinosaur fossils discovered in Hong Kong may provide valuable insights into the Cretaceous period\u2019s terrestrial ecosystems in South China and bring new blood to the academic field, experts have said.\n\nBut a veteran geologist expressed concerns that the fascinating find could result in lasting damage to nature, adding that the city\u2019s curriculum design had misled students interested in geology into selecting a social science subject.\n\nThe experts\u2019 remarks were made before a group of fossil rocks found on Port Island in the Hong Kong Unesco Global Geopark was due to be shown to the public for the first time on Friday.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nYoung Ng Chun-yeong, former chairman of the Association for Geoconservation and a key proponent of the geopark designation, said he expected the discovery to reignite public interest in geoscience and deliver long-term benefits to academia.\n\n\u201cBefore having the geopark, most people thought that Hong Kong was mainly a city and a concrete forest, without paying special attention to the natural rock foundations that we have,\u201d said Ng, who now chairs an ecotourism strategy reference group of the Australian Geoscience Council.\n\n\u201cNow that dinosaur fossils have been discovered, people will again notice that the natural foundation of Hong Kong is quite spectacular.\u201d\n\nThe star attraction of the geopark has long been the hexagonal rock columns in Sai Kung, which were formed when a supervolcano erupted 140 million years ago.\n\nNg said that with the finding, \u201ca new story will emerge\u201d that will also put the sedimentary rock formations in other parts of the geopark under the spotlight.\n\n\u201cNew stories will create new excitement, especially for teenagers as they are particularly interested in dinosaurs. So we can use the fossils as an attraction to stimulate teenagers\u2019 interest in this aspect, which will drive interest in future learning,\u201d he said.\n\nNg added that the greater interest from students might also make geoscience research topics popular at universities, which could eventually lead to an increase in researchers and resources in the city\u2019s Earth science academia.\n\nThe fossils belonged to an undetermined kind of dinosaur that dated to the Cretaceous period about 145 million to 66 million years ago.\n\nPalaeontologist Fion Ma Wai-sum said that no animal could survive alone in the wild. She explained that the discovery suggested there was an ecosystem in the vicinity of the island during prehistoric times.\n\n\u201cIt definitely helps to provide a full picture of the dinosaurs living in South China in the past,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that it was plausible that experts would find even more fossils on the island, not only dinosaurs but other animals and plants.\n\nShe also expressed hopes that more resources would be allocated to relevant research, education and outreach activities due to the new discovery and the scientific significance of it.\n\nMichael Pittman, assistant professor at the school of life sciences at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said experts will compare the fossils found in the city with those from mainland China after conducting scientific research to determine the exact type of dinosaur.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that we can find out with further study,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf the new finds lead to additional resources for the further expansion of paleontological studies in the city, that would be fantastic.\u201d\n\nChan Lung-sang, a visiting professor of the Department of Earth and Planetary Science at the University of California, Berkeley, said he doubted sufficient resources would ever be properly allocated to support geological studies in Hong Kong because geology was often considered as a marginal subject at schools.\n\n\u201cAlthough many students are passionate about topics like rocks, fossils and weather, they are frequently directed toward studying geography, which is primarily social studies ... The current school curriculum design, unfortunately, is not conducive to a proper earth science education in Hong Kong,\u201d he said.\n\nThe veteran geologist, who curated the new palaeontology gallery that opened last year at the Science Museum, also cautioned against attempts to commercially exploit scientific discovery.\n\n\u201cMy greatest concern is that fascinating discoveries, such as the dinosaur bone fossils, could end up being leveraged for economic initiatives, like promoting \u2018dinosaur bone tourism\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis could potentially lead to infrastructure development in our country parks, eventually resulting in irreversible changes to our natural heritage.\u201d\n\nMore from South China Morning Post:\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2024."

Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nNew study redefines traditional views on black hole formation\n\nMIT scientists discover 1st-ever black hole triple system\n\nBy Akash Pandey 01:21 pm Oct 26, 202401:21 pm\n\nWhat's the story In a recent study, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have discovered a black hole triple system. This is the first time such a configuration has been observed. The unique system consists of a central black hole consuming a nearby star that orbits it every 6.5 days, and another distant star orbiting it every 70,000 years.\n\nTheory challenge\n\nBlack hole must have formed due to 'direct collapse'\n\nThe discovery of the black hole triple system is challenging existing theories about how black holes are formed. Traditionally, black holes are believed to form from the violent explosion of a dying star, a process known as a supernova. However, the newly discovered triple system suggests that this black hole may have formed through a gentler process called \"direct collapse\" rather than a violent supernova, due to the presence of a distant star orbiting the central black hole.\n\nAccidental find\n\nDiscovery of black hole triple system was unexpected\n\nThe discovery of the black hole triple system was somewhat fortuitous. The scientists stumbled upon it while examining Aladin Lite, a collection of astronomical observations from telescopes worldwide. They were initially searching for new black holes within our Milky Way galaxy when they made this unprecedented discovery.\n\nSystem focus\n\nTriple system centers on well-studied black hole\n\nThe triple system revolves around V404 Cygni, a black hole situated some 8,000 light-years away from Earth. Even though it is one of the most studied black holes (since 1992), none of the previous studies reported what study author Kevin Burdge and his colleagues observed. The team spotted two different sources of light near V404 Cygni, which led to the discovery of this unique triple system.\n\nMotion confirmation\n\nOuter star's motion confirms triple system\n\nTo confirm the link between the outer star and the black hole, scientists examined data from Gaia, a satellite that has been monitoring all stars in our galaxy since 2014. They observed that both the stars moved in perfect sync as opposed to other nearby stars. The odds of such synchronized movement are about one in 10 million, further solidifying their discovery of this unique triple system.\n\nSimulation support\n\nSimulations support theory of black hole's gentle formation\n\nTo understand how this triple system could have evolved and retained the outer star, Burdge and colleagues conducted simulations. The results overwhelmingly showed that the most plausible way for this triple system to exist is through direct collapse. This supports their theory that the black hole in question was formed gently, without a violent supernova explosion."

A rundown of all the changes can be found below:\n\nFixed to delete files received from an unknown sender with the same payload ID.\n\nFixed an issue that caused the app to crash when a file name has non-ASCII characters.\n\nFixed an issue where non-ASCII characters prevented received files from opening successfully.\n\nFixed an issue when reading preferences.\n\nFixed an issue where preferences failed to save on certain system configurations.\n\nFixed an issue that kept the Quick Share shortcut icon from showing up in the Start menu after installation.\n\nFixed an issue that caused the app to crash when reading an input file.\n\nFixed an issue that caused multiple GATT reads during discovery.\n\nFixed a bug to stop Wi-Fi LAN advertising.\n\nFixed an issue that caused the app to crash when connecting to Bluetooth.\n\nFixed an issue that prevented the Wi-Fi hotspot profile from being deleted correctly.\n\nFixed an issue where the Wi-Fi hotspot couldnt be recovered when the app was closed during file transfer.\n\nGet ready for an improved mobile app UI as well\n\nThe update follows version 1.0.1939.4, which improved the app's animations, added car and foldable devices to the list of device types, alongside support for credential expiration. It's worth noting that the Quick Share app on the Microsoft Store is Samsung's iteration, and currently only works with Samsung devices. Google's unified version of the app for Windows devices is only available through its own website.\n\nIn other Quick Share-related news, Google seems to be testing out a UI tweak for the app on mobile that brings it closer to the desktop counterpart. For reference, Quick Share on Windows shows an estimate of the time remaining alongside the transfer speed during an active transfer. As part of a recent test, users on mobile have now started spotting a percentage-based progress bar, resulting in more precise transfer progress tracking. The change seems to be part of an A/B test, and hasn't rolled out widely yet."

        "article_content": "HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 MSRP $1,400.00 Score Details \u201cThe HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 takes over the mantle as the best 2-in-1 convertible you can buy.\u201d Pros Solid build quality\n\nAttractive aesthetic\n\nVery good battery life\n\nGorgeous OLED display\n\nExcellent keyboard\n\nGreat haptic touchpad Cons Performance is just OK\n\nExpensive list prices\n\nI really liked HP\u2019s Spectre x360 14 2-in-1. It was incredibly well-built, drop-dead gorgeous, was built around a spectacular OLED display, and at the time, landed on our ranking of the best laptops you could buy. I was a little nervous when HP announced its rebranding, doing away with the Spectre line and introducing the OmniBook is its new brand for its entire consumer lineup.\n\nThe OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is the Spectre\u2019s true replacement, and when I pulled it out of the box, I was a little relieved. It\u2019s built around Intel\u2019s latest Lunar Lake chipset, and that needed testing, but the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 shares many of the same great characteristics as its predecessors. It\u2019s not as long-lasting as some other Lunar Lake laptops in terms of battery life, but it\u2019s still a great 2-in-1 option.\n\nSpecs and configuration\n\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 Dimensions 12.35 x 8.51 x 0.59 inches Weight 2.97 pounds Display 14.0-inch 16:10 2.8K (2880 x 1800) OLED, 120Hz CPU Intel Core Ultra 5 226V\n\nIntel Core Ultra 7 256V\n\nIntel Core Ultra 7 258V\n\nIntel Core Ultra 9 288V GPU Intel Arc 130V\n\nIntel Arc 140V Memory 16GB LPDDR5X RAM\n\n32GB LPDDR5X RAM Storage 512TB M.2 NVMe SSD\n\n1TB M.2 NVMe SSD\n\n2TB M.2 NVMe SSD Ports 2 x USB-C with Thunderbolt 4\n\n1 x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2\n\n1 x 3.5mm headphone jack Camera 9MP with infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 7 Bluetooth Bluetooth 5.4 Battery 64 watt-hour Operating system Windows 11 Price $ 1,450+\n\nHP\u2019s prices vary from sale to sale, and so you have to check regularly to see what the actual price is when you\u2019re ready to make your purchase. The OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is no different. The base model with a Core Ultra 5 226V chipset, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and the standard 14-inch 2.8K OLED display has a list price $1,450 but is currently on sale for $1,100 at the time of writing. My review unit with a Core Ultra 7 258V, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD is on sale for $1,400, down from a list price of $1,750. And then the high-end configuration with a Core Ultra 9 288V and a 2TB SSD lists for $2,080 but is on sale right now at $1,730.\n\nIf you compare the list prices to a competitor like the Asus Zenbook S 14, another Lunar Lake laptop, the HP is more expensive. The Asus costs $1,399 for a Core Ultra 7 258V, 32GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 14-inch OLED display. The equivalent HP list price would be a more expensive $1,700, but the sale price is slightly less at $1,350. And then consider the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x, which is just $1,199 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chipset, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 14.5-inch OLED display. With 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, it\u2019s $1,313. That\u2019s less than the HP\u2019s sale prices.\n\nThe bottom line is that the OmniBook Ultra Flip tends to run on the more expensive side, though the sale prices make it more competitive.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Spectre x360 14 was an awesome 2-in-1. It had a gorgeous aesthetic, was solidly built, and featured some useful features like USB-C ports notch of the back corners that allowed plugging in and keep cables neatly out of the way. The OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 has a slightly less ostentatious design, but it maintains what was best about the Spectre. And it\u2019s a strong competitor against laptops like the Zenbook S14, the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x, and the Yoga Slim 7i that has a larger 15.3-inch display.\n\nTo begin with, the notches are still there and remain just as functional. The build quality is incredibly solid, with no bending, flexing, or twisting in the lid, keyboard deck, or chassis. The hinge is just slightly too firm to open the lid with one hand, but that\u2019s because it has to hold everything in place in clamshell, tent, media, and tablet modes. Simply put, the OmniBook exudes quality just like the best premium laptops.\n\nAnd while the OmniBook doesn\u2019t have the same colorful accents as the old Spectre, its all-black color way is just as attractive. The edges are more rounded, which is not only a good look but also helps the OmniBook being more comfortable to hold as a tablet. I\u2019ve mentioned a few other very nice laptops I\u2019ve reviewed lately, and the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is as nicely design as any of them.\n\nIt\u2019s also just as portable. It\u2019s thin at 0.59 inches and light at 2.97 pounds. Its display bezels are reasonably small, especially for a 360-degree convertible 2-in-1.\n\nKeyboard and touchpad\n\nI\u2019ve long been a fan of HP\u2019s keyboards, particularly those in the Specre lineup. The keycaps are large with highly legible lettering, and there\u2019s a ton of key spacing. The switches are light and snappy, giving a precise feel. I found the OmniBook\u2019s keyboard to be every bit as comfortable as Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard, my other favorite, for long-form writing \u2014 such as this review. HP gave the function keys a gray color and it helps them stand out, but that does detract a little from the otherwise cohesive aesthetic. The power button is a light-blue color with a bright LED, and it helps identify it but, again, it kind of stands out a little too much.\n\nEqually excellent is the large touchpad that takes up most of the available space on the palm rest. Not only is it large enough, it\u2019s also a haptic feedback touchpad that\u2019s responsive and supports clicking across the entire surface. It doesn\u2019t have the same kind of Force Click functionality of Apple\u2019s Force Touch haptic touchpad, but it\u2019s still very good and welcome here.\n\nThe display is pen- and touch-enabled, of course, and everything works as it should. If you want a laptop that can convert to a tablet for writing and drawing on the display, then the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is a great example of the form.\n\nConnectivity and webcam\n\nConnectivity is pretty light for a 14-inch laptop. There are just three USB-C ports \u2014 two of them with Thunderbolt 4, and one of them provides power. It\u2019s nice that two are tucked away in the notches, but I would have liked to see at least on legacy port and an SD card reader. At least there\u2019s a 3.5mm audio jack, which Dell dropped on the XPS 13. Wireless connectivity is up-to-date.\n\nThe webcam is a high-res 9MP model with an infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello facial recognition. There\u2019s also a fingerprint reader in the power button. This is as good a time as any to mention that the OmniBook has a fast enough neural processing unit (NPU) to power Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+ PC AI initiative. Today, it supports the enhanced Microsoft Studio Effects software, which includes AI-assisted background blur and replace, filters, and auto framing. HP\u2019s own AI Companion software is also on its way, which will support a variety of on-device features under the rubrics Discover, Analyze, and Perform that apply AI to getting intelligence assistance using the laptop, analyzing files, and optimizing performance.\n\nDisplay and audio\n\nThe OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 has one display option: a 2.8K (2880 x 1800) OLED panel running at up to 120Hz. Out of the box, it\u2019s awesome, with OLED\u2019s usual inky blacks and dynamic colors.\n\nMy colorimeter agreed. It\u2019s bright at 385 nits, although several OLED displays I\u2019ve reviewed recently are brighter. The Surface Pro 11\u2018s panel is an example at 533 nits. The OmniBook\u2019s colors are wide at 100% of sRGB, 95% of AdobeRGB, and 100% of DCI-P3, with a color accuracy of Delta-E 0.67, which is excellent. The Surface Pro 11\u2019s display is less colorful at 100%, 85%, and 97%, respectively, and its accuracy was around the same at 0.74.\n\nReally, there\u2019s nothing to complain about with this display. You\u2019ll love it. Dual downward-firing speakers pump out loud audio with some distortion at full volume, and with crisp mids and highs but little bass. It\u2019s pretty typical.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is the latest laptop I\u2019ve reviewed running Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake chipset. Specifically, it\u2019s the Core Ultra 7 258V, a Series 2 chipset running at 17 watts. As such, it competes most directly against Intel\u2019s previous 15-watt Core Ultra U-series, but in practice it\u2019s the most immediate replacement for the 28-watt Core Ultra H-series processors.\n\nOverall, Lunar Lake has shown itself to be faster than the U-series, which was also aimed at efficiency, and in some cases to be faster in single-core tasks than the H-series while around the same speed in multi-core. We see that with the OmniBook compared to the Spectre x360 14 running that Core Ultra 7 155H. Notably, the OmniBook is slower than laptops running Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X chipsets, another efficiency-focused lineup. And then the Apple M3 has much faster single-core performance than all these laptops to go with very good multi-core performance.\n\nThe bottom line is that the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is plenty fast for demanding productivity users. Its Intel Arc 140V graphics are faster than its predecessor, but not as fast as entry-level discrete GPUs. So, that means it won\u2019t offer any advantages for creators or gamers.\n\nCinebench R24\n\n(single/multi) Geekbench 6\n\n(single/multi) Handbrake\n\n(seconds) HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V / Intel Arc 140V) 116 / 598 2483 / 10725 99 HP Spectre x360 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 155H / Intel Arc) 102 / 485 2176 / 11980 93 Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V / Intel Arc 140V) 109 / 630 2485 / 10569 88 Asus Zenbook S 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V / Intel Arc 140V) 112 / 452 2738 / 10734 113 HP OmniBook X\n\n(Snapdragon X Elite / Adreno) 101 / 749 2377 / 13490 N/A Asus ProArt PX13\n\n(Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / RTX 4050) 116 / 897 2710 / 14696 54 MacBook Air\n\n(M3) 141 / 601 3102 / 12078 109\n\nBattery life\n\nAs I\u2019ve stressed in each of my Lunar Lake laptop reviews, efficiency is the primary goal of this round of Intel\u2019s chipsets. As we see above, performance doesn\u2019t stand out, so battery life becomes more important. In part, that\u2019s because of the excellent efficiency of Apple Silicon, with the M3 chipset being both fast and efficient.\n\nHere, we see that the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is a lot more efficient than the Spectre x360 14, especially in web browsing. It\u2019s not quite as efficient as Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i and the Zenbook S 14, and the Qualcomm laptops are stronger as well.\n\nThe OmniBook is held back a bit by its 64-watt-hour battery, which isn\u2019t huge, and it also sports a high-res, 120Hz OLED display. That also doesn\u2019t help. And while it\u2019s not as good as some others, it\u2019s still a lot more efficient than most Intel Meteor Lake laptops. That means that while it can\u2019t keep up with Apple\u2019s M3, it will still likely get through a day\u2019s work with moderate productivity workflows.\n\nWeb browsing Video Cinebench R24 HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V) 11 hours, 5 minutes 15 hours, 46 minutes 2 hours, 14 minutes HP Spectre x360 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 155H) 7 hours, 9 minutes 14 hours, 22 minutes N/A Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V) 14 hours, 16 minutes 17 hours, 31 minutes 2 hours, 15 minutes Asus ExpertBook P5\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V) 8 hours, 54 minutes 16 hours, 29 minutes 2 hours, 15 minutes Asus Zenbook S 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V) 16 hours, 47 minutes 18 hours, 35 minutes 3 hours, 33 minutes Microsoft Surface Laptop\n\n(Snapdragon X Elite X1E-80-100) 14 hours, 21 minutes 22 hours, 39 minutes N/A HP Omnibook X\n\n(Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100) 13 hours, 37 minutes 22 hours, 4 minutes 1 hour, 52 minutes Asus Vivobook S 15\n\n(Snapdragon X Plus) 13 hours, 10 minutes 16 hours, 19 minutes N/A Asus ProArt PX13\n\n(Ryzen AI 9 HX 370) 8 hours, 7 minutes 11 hours, 12 minutes 1 hour, 12 minutes Apple MacBook Air\n\n(Apple M3) 19 hours, 38 minutes 19 hours, 39 minutes 3 hours, 27 minutes\n\nA worthy successor to one of our favorite 2-in-1s\n\nThe Spectre x360 14 was a great laptop, maybe the best example of the 360-degree convertible 2-in-1. With HP\u2019s rebranding, I was wondering how much else would change with the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t have to worry too much.\n\nThere\u2019s really not a lot to dislike about the OmniBook. It gets very good battery life, has a gorgeous OLED display, and it look and feels great. Its performance isn\u2019t the best, but it\u2019s fast enough, and its keyboard and touchpad are excellent. It\u2019s most attractive, though, at its sale prices."
