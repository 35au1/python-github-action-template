The rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa\n\nHe has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansj\u00fcrgen K\u00f6hler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (CENAP), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says K\u00f6hler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office CENAP.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nAccording to its director, CENAP has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, K\u00f6hler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact for observers of the inexplicable\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, K\u00f6hler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe founded CENAP as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand.\"\n\nThe organization, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to CENAP has changed dramatically over the decades, K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese Lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nNumber of reports spike thanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organization recorded over 850 cases by October 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups - rocket ignitions - in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun,\" K\u00f6hler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, CENAP records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nThe organization also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the CENAP director.\n\nDo only conspiracy theorists report UFO sightings?\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, K\u00f6hler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship ... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nK\u00f6hler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organization is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nK\u00f6hler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life - or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth.\"\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\"\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa"

            "article_content": "LLMs. Co-pilots. Agents. Two years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, the hype behind artificial Intelligence remains palpable. Major tech companies are pouring billions into sparkling new infrastructure for AI workloads. Utility companies in areas with dense data centers are seeing revenues and power consumption soar. Yet, outside of semiconductor and infrastructure players, few companies have seen significant revenue from AI products. Investors are increasingly left asking: When will these massive capital investments start benefiting software companies? What\u2019s causing the delay?\n\nWhere AI is showing up in our world today\n\nFirst, let\u2019s be clear: AI has been around in many industries for years, including financial services. Quantitative traders long ago embraced techniques that are now classified as \"AI\" including non-linear regressions and advanced optimization techniques. What excites us now are the rapid advancements in new areas like Generative AI, pattern recognition and deep learning. You\u2019ve likely noticed early use cases of GenAI like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot or Adobe\u2019s AI Assistant. These tools are being integrated into software platforms across industries with new use cases emerging at a rapid clip.\n\n\n\nAcross other industries, anecdotal datapoints of GenAI value creation are starting to stack up. Walmart recently shared that large language models helped them to \u201ccreate or improve more than 850 million pieces of data across its product catalog,\u201d completing the project with just 1% of the typical headcount. Amazon\u2019s CEO Andy Jassy shared a similar datapoint when he disclosed that the use of Amazon\u2019s GenAI assistant saved 7,500 \u201cdeveloper-years\u201d of programming time in a recent major software update.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most salient example of AI generating value is hiding under our collective noses in social media, where algorithmic matching on posts like Instagram and TikTok optimizes the content and ads we see. This area has seen tremendous gains in recent years and has helped leading AI adopters in social media improve ad returns and gain market share.\n\n\n\nAt our firm, we\u2019ve adopted AI with care, led initially by eager adoption of various AI copilots and coding assistants. We have also explored alpha-generating use cases like pattern recognition and sentiment analysis. Looking further out, we are excited about developing custom assistants to superpower our investment and client teams. We believe this is just the tip of the iceberg. Much more is yet to come.\n\nThe delay in benefits of AI for software investors\n\n\n\nSo, if AI is being leveraged across industries, why hasn\u2019t the software sector seen the uptick in growth that investors expected? New revenue streams for software firms haven\u2019t met the hype, leading to stark underperformance for the software industry with a few notable exceptions. We believe this partly reflects Amara\u2019s law: We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. The rapid adoption of ChatGPT, and the sense of magic many of us experienced when first using it, may have exacerbated elevated expectations.\n\n\n\nThe reality is that product development and adoption take time. AI development and testing alone can take months, if not years, before a project is ready for deployment. This timeline is further elongated by data governance challenges. As anyone who has worked at a massive conglomerate can likely attest, many large firms have poorly structured and poorly governed data policies, rife with operational silos and inconsistent rules. This complicates development. Compliance and cybersecurity can further stretch timelines. While many firms are seeing real and tangible benefits from AI, getting these projects into production is taking longer than anticipated, creating a mismatch between investor expectations and reality.\n\n\n\nWhile this delay has certainly led to disappointment among software investors, it has not been the only issue. The rapid pace of breakthrough innovation in AI has also sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the room for other technology projects. Some companies have paused major technology initiatives, hesitating to commit to multi\\year contracts while still developing their AI strategy. All of this has elongated sales cycles and created a temporary slowdown in software demand.\n\nA window of opportunity for longer-term investors\n\nSurveys have shown that corporations are seeing real, tangible value creation from AI, especially in cost reduction. But AI isn\u2019t just about optimizing existing business models \u2014 it\u2019s driving innovation in areas like autonomous cars, healthcare, clean energy, and even entertainment and media. These advancements have the potential to reshape industries and open up new markets. For long-term investors, this makes AI more than a short-term play \u2014 it\u2019s a foundation for future growth. Again, like many transformative technologies, AI\u2019s impact may have been overestimated in the short term, but its long-term potential will likely have been underestimated.\n\n\n\nWe believe the current market anxiety in software creates an opportunity for long-term investors. The project delays are largely temporary in nature and should be resolved as firms update their technological road map and set AI priorities. Recently, we\u2019ve noticed renewed enthusiasm in the software demand environment. As demand normalizes, we expect industry growth to re-accelerate, which should remove the wet blanket from valuations.\n\nBottom line\n\n\n\nA Gartner survey earlier this year found that 90% of CFOs expected increased AI budgets in 2024, with none planning cuts. Yet, it has been clear that many projects have faced delays due to complexity, data governance issues, security concerns, and a scarcity of talent. This has created an air pocket in an industry that is usually known more for \"eating the world\" than for booms and busts. Just as the internet didn\u2019t take off overnight, AI still has some development before it starts to deliver significant results for investors. We believe those returns are coming, and the impact is on the horizon if investors can remain patient. Now is the time for investors to position themselves for the shift from hype to impact. As AI projects move from development to deployment, those who stay the course or increase their exposure to the right opportunities are likely to see meaningful returns ahead.\n\nDave Smith is head of technology investing at Bailard.

Each was followed by much applause and favorable stock price movement. But when I got those phones into my hands, the AI was underwhelming, to say the least.\n\nThe theory is that smartphones as we know them are evolving into something new: AI smartphones. An AI smartphone will be a new kind of device that doesn\u2019t force you to interact with a grid of apps all day long; you\u2019ll be able to ask it to order pizza or send an email just by using an AI-imbued voice assistant. You\u2019ll be able to point your camera at a flyer for a show, have the AI check whether you\u2019re free, and add it to your calendar. You\u2019ll ask it about something a friend said to you \u2014 maybe in an email or a text, you\u2019re not sure which \u2014 and it will go find the information for you.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini assistant has steadily improved since launch but still falls short of a true AI assistant.\n\nPersonally, all of the above sounds great to me. I\u2019d love some help with the chores I carry out a hundred times a day on my phone \u2014 and with the firehose of incoming information and notifications I deal with. But AI smartphones are not here yet, not by a long shot, despite what you may have heard. Instead, what we have feels like a collection of loosely associated tech demos.\n\nThe (supposedly) AI smartphones of 2024\n\nAll of the major phone makers are at fault. Samsung opened the year with its Galaxy S24 launch in January, declaring \u201cGalaxy AI is here\u201d at a hockey arena-appropriate volume. To be sure, the devices it announced are good smartphones, and they run a blend of Samsung and Google\u2019s Gemini Nano models on-device, but I wouldn\u2019t call them AI smartphones.\n\nSupposedly, they can help you take distractions out of your photos \u2014 but you might end up with something even more distracting instead. The live language interpreter feature for phone calls could come in handy for something like making a dinner reservation. But it also translated a statement from my colleague as \u201cI am eating my chair.\u201d (She was not.) Most users will find that these AI features fade into the background once the novelty wears off.\n\nSometimes AI gets it right \u2014 it correctly identifies an artificial plant here.\n\nLater in 2024, fall hardware season arrived early with AI-ified Pixels. Google has made much of AI on its phones for the past couple of years, but the company\u2019s Gemini AI is absolutely everywhere on the Pixel 9 series. There\u2019s an AI-generated summary at the top of the weather app, a new app that saves and tags your screenshots using AI, a new AI-powered default assistant, and lots of AI image generation tools \u2014 from silly to seriously worrying.\n\nSome of it does feel useful, particularly the screenshots app, which is the kind of thing you might find handy if you tend to keep infinite Chrome tabs open on your phone as bookmarks. But these features, siloed into their respective apps, don\u2019t feel like they have much to do with each other. Gemini sort of connects the dots with extensions, but support for different apps is being added slowly \u2014 and even with an extension, Gemini can only do so much for you.\n\nApple Intelligence started shipping a month after the iPhone 16, but its blockbuster features won\u2019t arrive until 2025.\n\nLast but not least, we met the iPhones \u201cbuilt for Apple Intelligence\u201d in September. I think it says a lot about the state of Apple\u2019s AI that the iPhone 16 initially shipped without Apple Intelligence. AI features finally arrived in late October with iOS 18.1. And if anyone was waiting with bated breath, this first update was probably underwhelming.\n\nRight now, Apple Intelligence includes summaries for notifications and emails, tools to alter the style of your writing, and a new glowing UI for Siri. Notification summaries can be useful, but usually they\u2019re just funny. The writing tools are standard fare at this point, and Siri is basically the same old assistant with a new coat of paint. There\u2019s more to come, but what\u2019s here now certainly doesn\u2019t add up to an AI smartphone.\n\nA messy year for AI\n\nIt\u2019s not just phones; this is a messy moment for AI in general. Depending on who you ask, AI is either a massive bubble that\u2019s about to burst or a few months away from evolving into digital God. AI is being foisted on us in every direction: surfacing in Google search results, lurking in every Meta product, greeting you by name in the Spotify app. It\u2019s hard to separate the signal from the noise when it comes to AI, because the noise is everywhere and it\u2019s so goddamn loud!\n\nAnd there really might be a signal in there \u2014 especially when it comes to our phones. Siri really might become more useful, with an Apple Intelligence update this spring that will allow it to take action in apps through something known as App Intents. Developers will be able to surface certain actions \u2014 like ordering the pizza that AI proponents keep promising \u2014 so they\u2019re accessible at the system level by Siri. Google seems to be preparing a similar framework in Android 16, which could help bridge the gap between Gemini and individual apps without the apps needing an entire extension. And who knows? Maybe Bixby will get in the game, too.\n\nThe trouble is, after a full year of supposedly game-changing AI on our mobile devices that amounted to nothing, it\u2019s starting to sound like the phone makers are crying wolf. The real AI smartphones need to stand up pretty soon \u2014 before our collective patience starts to run out."

However, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Garrett Simons a new property they were moved to has caused her to be fearful for her children due to \"paranormal activity\".\n\nThe mum told proceedings how since they moved in \u201cnumerous objects\u201d in the new house have been \u201cflown from side to side\u201d, while doors and a table and chairs \u201cwere moving in front of our eyes\u201d. She claims while making food for her children, objects flew out of the cupboard she opened.\n\nMs Stokes said she contacted the previous occupant of the house, who wrote them a letter the applicant described as \u201cbeyond traumatic\u201d. She claimed she brought the letter to the attention of the council but was \u201claughed at\u201d in a meeting. She said: \u201cEveryone deserves a home. I never asked for a mansion, I asked for a safe home for my kids.\n\n\u201cI just want somewhere safe for my kids five days before Christmas,\u201d the Irish Mirror reported.\n\nThe High Court heard how the mould in the first property was so bad the entire family had to sleep downstairs instead of their bedrooms. They also had to make several hospital visits. The couple claim in the five years they lived in the property, the problem with mould became so bad that they were forced to leave and live temporarily with relatives before returning to the house.\n\nThe court heard the council placed the family on a transfer list and the offer of a new property was accepted by the Stokes in October. At the High Court Mr Justice Simons struck out the Stokes\u2019 claim against Leitrim County Council.\n\nMr Justice Simons said the claim before him only related to the first property and that if there were new claims, they would have to be lodged separately with the court. Mr Justice Simons said the only case before him was in relation to the first house and \u201cthe case has come and gone, as it were\u201d due to the Stokes' transferring to the new house.\n\nHe told Ms Stokes he understood her concern about the second house experiencing \"paranormal activity\" and her fears for the safety of her children but a third house would mean a new application to the local authority."

The two of them start talking after Momo rescues Okarun from getting bullied. However, an argument ensues between them \u2013 Momo believes in ghosts but denies aliens, and Okarun believes in aliens but denies ghosts,\u201d reads the official synopsis. \u201cTo make the mutual deniers believe in each other, Momo goes to an abandoned hospital known for its UFO sightings, and Okarun goes to a tunnel that is said to be haunted.

            "article_content": "In early October, Metal Gear Solid creator and friend of every celebrity alive Hideo Kojima posted that he'd watched and enjoyed the debut of Dan Da Dan, the anime adaptation of Yukinobu Tatsu's terrific manga. This isn't out of the ordinary, as Kojima is pretty fond of liberally posting about all of the media that he likes. And when he praised the seventh episode, at the time the best episode so far in a long string of 'best episodes so far', it affirmed that Dan Da Dan is a series that you shouldn't miss.\n\nHowever, the power of Dan Da Dan lies in something that might not be apparent at first. In fact, much of the strength of the series comes from it undermining any expectations that you might have.\n\nDan Da Dan tells the story of two teens, the sheepish Ken Takakura, aka \"Okarun\", who is fascinated by aliens and the paranormal, and the outspoken Momo Ayase who, thanks in part to her spirit medium grandmother, is invested in the supernatural.\n\nNeither is convinced about the other's obsessions, and so when Takakura goes to investigate a \"haunted\" tunnel, he becomes possessed by a spirit there. Meanwhile, Ayase is abducted by perverse aliens, an encounter that awakens her psychokinetic powers. Working together, the two begin to take on all manner of fantastical enemies, all while navigating their own burgeoning romantic feelings.\n\nUnusual usual\n\n(Image credit: \u00a9Yukinobu Tatsu/SHUEISHA, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\n'People taking on sci-fi monsters while blushing around one another' is certainly not uncharted territory, and it would be easy for Dan Da Dan to operate on a level of simple escapism. But few anime have been able to filter all this through pure, effective teenage angst quite like Dan Da Dan. Ayase, like most teens, fears being an outsider, and still reckons with childhood memories of being treated like one thanks to her grandmother's metaphysical mandates.\n\nTakakura, on the other hand, soon discovers that his genitals have been stolen by Turbo Granny, the spirit that lurks within him (yes, really). And so the typical hyper-awareness that one has about themselves during this stage in your life is magnified tenfold for the eternally anxious Takakura. It doesn't help that many of the creatures and spirits prod and taunt Takakura and Ayase about these things, exposing all of the little insecurities that even regular teenagers struggle to hide.\n\nDan Da Dan is also beautifully animated and bears stellar character and creature designs (courtesy of anime veteran Naoyuki Onda), some of which reflect traditional Japanese yokai and a host of otherworldly beasts. These foes are outsized, monstrous, and come loaded with their own eccentricities, but just when you feel caught up in the adrenaline of seeing a spirit-filled Takakura take on one of them in a high-speed contest, you're hit with the gut punch of what lies under the quirks.\n\nSign up for the Total Film Newsletter Bringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nMany of these foes, from Turbo Granny, whose spirit tends to the souls of young women who died under horrific circumstances, to Acrobatic Silky, a yokai who desperately searches for the child that was once taken from her when she was alive, generate profound sympathy. The latter was even treated to a beautiful tearjerker of an extended flashback that showed her attempts to give her daughter the best life possible despite their circumstances.\n\nBittersweet victory\n\n(Image credit: Netflix)\n\nAs such, their defeat is rarely a triumphant 'boss fight' event, but instead a bittersweet denouement to a tragic afterlife. Even human characters that initially emerge as one-note bullies, like pink-haired Aira Shiratori, are revealed to be grappling with something personal. Aira, for instance, lost her mother at a young age, and much of her imperious personality comes from her search for a purpose.\n\nDan Da Dan continuously shows us that it has heart. Takakura and Ayase bicker constantly in will-they/won't-they fashion, and it's common in lesser anime for relationships to subsist entirely on this type of repartee. But the pair are also constantly worried about one another. From the beginning, there's genuine care shown for each other's emotional upkeep, something that they've taken upon themselves even if the other person is still, in the grand scheme of things, a stranger. They're not teaming up to save the world (though they do want to get Takakura's privates returned to him) \u2013 they're teaming up because they've formed a genuine connection. In their cliquish school setting, that's pretty rare.\n\nIt's easy to imagine the kind of story that Dan Da Dan could've been, one that milks nothing but fan service out of Takakura and Ayase's relationship, one that presents new creatures for the sole purpose of their explosive defeats, and one that ignores any weighty themes about growing up and teenage paranoia in favor of purely digestible escapades. But Dan Da Dan rarely takes the easy route. Instead, it's consistently thoughtful in a way that has turned each episode into not just a fun weekly occurrence, but an outright event. Combine that with a production that is hitting all the right notes, and you have an anime that's bound to surprise you regardless of whether you've read the manga or not.\n\nDan Da Dan is set to return for season 2 in July 2025. While we wait, you can read everything we know about Dan Da Dan season 2."

            "article_content": "Right whales are among the rarest whales on Earth, and their populations are highly endangered. Now, scientists say some of the gentle giants may live nearly twice as long as previously thought. The new findings, published December 20 in the journal Science Advances, make southern right whales the mammal with the second-longest known life span, behind only the bowhead whale. The findings\u2014and the novel methods used to achieve them\u2014could help inform conservation efforts moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking about these whales all wrong,\u201d says study co-author Peter Corkeron, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia, to the Guardian\u2019s Petra Stock. \u201cIt\u2019s impeded our ability to get it right when it comes to doing the science for conservation to stop these whales from going extinct.\u201d\n\nEstimating the age of some individual whales is relatively easy. For example, a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) killed in 2007 had a harpoon tip stuck in its blubber that was manufactured in the late 1800s, allowing researchers to surmise it was at least 115 years old.\n\nBut deducing the average life expectancy of an entire species can be more challenging. For one, past methods\u2014such as analyzing their earwax, which builds up each year like the rings of a tree\u2014have required whales to be dead. In addition, commercial whaling was so intense throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that most of the largest, oldest animals were likely missing from researchers\u2019 calculations. Most of today\u2019s longevity estimates are probably skewed by an overrepresentation of younger whales, the team writes in the paper.\n\nSo, for the new study, researchers deployed some new tactics. Using photos of right whales dating back to the 1970s, they identified individual females based on their appearance and noted when they stopped showing up in photos, presumably because they died. Then, they incorporated this information into statistical models that are similar to those used by life insurance companies to estimate human life expectancy.\n\nThese novel methods are \u201cquite impressive,\u201d as C. Scott Baker, an ecologist at Oregon State University who was not involved with the paper, tells Science\u2019s Mitch Leslie. \u201cThey make a good case for the plausibility of their results.\u201d\n\nThe findings suggest southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) have a median lifespan of about 73 years. But up to 10 percent might live to be 131 years old\u2014and a handful may even approach 150. That\u2019s much higher than previous estimates, which suggested the marine mammals had a maximum life expectancy between 70 and 80 years.\n\nResearchers used the same techniques for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), a critically endangered species with an estimated 372 individuals remaining. The study finds that North Atlantic right whales have a median lifespan of just 22 years, with the longest-living 10 percent surpassing the age of 47.\n\nOverall, the findings reinforce the idea that these animals are still bouncing back from the damage wrought by commercial whaling, a practice that ended less than four decades ago.\n\n\u201cTo attain healthy populations that include old animals, recovery might take hundreds of years,\u201d says study lead author Greg Breed, an ecologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, in a statement. \u201cFor animals that live to be 100 or 150 and only give birth to a surviving calf every 10 years or so, slow recovery is to be expected.\u201d\n\nWhy such a big life expectancy gap between southern and North Atlantic right whales? Scientists suspect North Atlantic right whales are much more vulnerable because of where they live. They primarily inhabit Atlantic coastal waters near Canada and the United States\u2014a bustling region with lots of commercial activity.\n\nThis month alone, three North Atlantic right whales were seen tangled in fishing gear off the East Coast of the U.S. They\u2019re also susceptible to boat strikes and climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a maze of rope these animals need to get through, and there\u2019s huge ports coming into the U.S., there\u2019s lots of shipping,\u201d Corkeron tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s Sam Bradbrook and Samantha Goerling.\n\nThe Southern Ocean, meanwhile, is not nearly as congested. One takeaway from the study is that \u201cit\u2019s important to keep it that way,\u201d Corkeron adds.\n\nMoving forward, researchers say their methods could be applied to other species, such as blue, fin, sei, humpback, gray and sperm whales. And, in the meantime, their recent findings could lead to the development of more effective conservation plans.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how long wild animals live has major implications for how to best protect them,\u201d Corkeron and Breed write in the Conversation. \u201cAnimals that have very long lifespans usually reproduce extremely slowly and can go many years between births. \u2026 Conservation and management strategies that do not plan accordingly will have a higher chance of failure. This is especially important given the expected impacts of climate disruption.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Microsoft and OpenAI have had something of a symbiotic relationship, with the former giving billions of capital to a startup AI lab and in return gaining early access to cutting-edge models that are now baked into Microsoft\u2019s suite of productivity software. The two companies have been headed in diverging directions, however, and Reuters reported today that Microsoft is looking to add more models to its 365 Copilot product that aren\u2019t built by OpenAI.\n\nThe reasoning, according to the report, is that Microsoft sees OpenAI\u2019s cutting-edge GPT-4 model as too expensive and not fast enough to satisfy its enterprise customers. Copilot 365 is an AI-powered assistant built into Microsoft\u2019s suite of productivity applications including Word and PowerPoint. The tool is supposed to ingest all of a company\u2019s data and do a myriad of things, like give users the ability to quickly find information without needing to hunt through disparate apps; quickly generate a list of the company\u2019s most profitable business units; or instantaneously summarize meetings and emails.\n\nIt is supposed to do those things, but customers and insiders alike are still underwhelmed by Copilot 365, which costs an extra $30 per month per user on a team. In a recent Business Insider story, employees of Microsoft speaking anonymously called the tools \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cgimmicky,\u201d not working well 75% of the time. On the customer front, Business Insider cited a survey of 123 IT leaders published by management consultancy Gartner, which found only four said Copilot provided significant value to their companies. It should be noted some other stories have reported on companies that have found value in using large language models, such as by simplifying customer support.\n\nSome customers who spoke to Business Insider specifically noted that 365 Copilot is too expensive.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT is a frontier, general model, meaning it is trained on vast swaths of data and can be more expensive and slow to run; that is why most models are offered in \u201clite\u201d versions that perform less intensive inference or \u201cthinking.\u201d Microsoft has been training its own in-house, smaller models like one called Phi-4, and Reuters reports that sources speaking to the outlet said the company is looking to \u201ccustomize other open-weight models to make 365 Copilot faster and more efficient.\u201d\n\nIn one sense, it makes sense that Microsoft would want to reduce its reliance on OpenAI. If the company is right and AI is going to be the next generational change in computing, relying on an independent company for the core technology is not a great idea.\n\nMicrosoft has plowed billions of dollars into OpenAI and will receive 75% of its profits until it makes it breaks even on its investment, and even then will still hold a large stake in the startup. The company in effect gets to hedge its bets\u2014build its own in-house models while keeping a lottery ticket in OpenAI in case it continues on its current skyward trajectory.\n\nDespite being the front-runner today, some skeptics of OpenAI say that we may not know a true winner in the AI race yet (should these technologies be as revolutionary as we are told to believe). In the same way that there were numerous search engines that came online in the \u201990s, only to be quickly trounced when the latecomer Google showed up. Microsoft is likely wise to hedge."

            "source": "Gizmodo",
            "article_content": "New Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse just dropped: According to the Financial Times, major defense technology companies Palantir and Palmer Luckey\u2019s Anduril are in conversations with SpaceX and OpenAI (among other tech players) to form a consortium to bid for US government defense contracts.\n\nThe goal of the group, which reportedly plans to announce its membership as soon as January, is to disrupt the \u201cprime\u201d contractors who have a habit of scoring major deals with the Pentagon. In the crosshairs of the consortium, there\u2019s Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing.\n\nThere is little question that the legacy brands do well bidding on defense work. According to the Department of Defense\u2019s Fiscal Year 2023 review, Lockheed Martin took home $61.4 billion, RTX (n\u00e9e Raytheon) scored $24.1 billion, and Boeing got a cool $20.1 billion. In 2021, 71% of all of Lockheed Martin\u2019s revenue came from contracts with the US government. Just under 50% of all annual sales for Boeing and RTX went to the feds during the same time period. As The American Prospect has previously pointed out, these are basically state-funded companies but the government has no real control over operations or leadership.\n\nSo would the safety and security of the country improve by disrupting the big three\u2019s vice grip on the Pentagon? Probably, under the assumption that mass-producing weapons of war and supplying them to allies for conflicts that range from mostly just to genocidal is a net positive on national security, which, let\u2019s call that dubious.\n\nBut this particular collection of tech firms as the hammer to bash the oligopoly? It\u2019s not clear that this is an improvement upon the status quo.\n\nPalantir has carved itself out a niche as the Defense Department\u2019s go-to for AI systems. Just this year, it snagged a $100 million contract to build the military AI-powered targeting tools and $480 million to expand the Pentagon\u2019s data analysis and decision making tools. The company has been more than happy to lend its tech to programs that are at best ethically questionable, including being the technological backbone of the Trump administration\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, helping lead to the breakup of migrant families and facilitating mass raids that led to the separation of children and parents. The company\u2019s technology has also been central to Israel\u2019s ongoing seige in Gaza that has killed over 45,000 people.\n\nAnduril, called \u201ctech\u2019s most controversial startup\u201d by Bloomberg, has built sensor towers for use on the US-Mexico border to track migrants and has explored the development of autonomous weapons. The company\u2019s big play is building drones for warfare, but it also has its eyes on building surveillance satellites, all of which carry some serious ethical questions attached.\n\nOpenAI recently announced a partnership with Anduril to work on anti-drone systems, but it seems likely that will be the first of many collaborations if the consortium comes together. The agreement, which has caused some upheaval among OpenAI employees who don\u2019t particularly want to be involved in doing defense work, comes after OpenAI quietly removed language from its usage policy restricting the use of its technology for military and warfare purposes.\n\nAnd on top of all that, It\u2019s Peter Thiel all the way down, baby. Thiel, the techno-libertarian lizard man who has not-so-quietly been trying to place his acolytes in as many branches of government as possible, has his hands in basically all of these firms. He founded Palantir, co-founded OpenAI, put major financial backing behind Anduril, and was an early-stage investor in SpaceX. He\u2019s proven himself to be a less-than-scrupulous person with an ideology that can far-too-generously be summed up as \u201ctechnological progress no matter the human cost.\u201d Thiel\u2019s biographer, Max Chafkin, told Time that Thiel is worth fearing, stating, \u201cWhen you combine the hostility to democracy and institutional norms with the bankroll of a billionaire you can potentially do some damage.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, maybe the malignant but status quo evil of the old school defense contractors doesn\u2019t seem quite as bad."

            "article_content": "Nestle Vietnam has set its sights to capitalise on rising demand for convenient beverage options in the country to drive the growth of its Nescafe a ready-to-serve liquid concentrate.\n\nAccording to the firm, Nescafe stepped up its format and product innovation to keep up with the latest trends and consumer demands.\n\n\u201cVietnam, in particular, is a country with a very rich coffee culture, and there have also been some novel popular trends emerging over the past few years,\u201d Nestle Vietnam Business Executive Officer Mostafa Youssef told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\n\u201cCold coffee tends to be more popular here, and interestingly there has also been a movement towards liquid coffees \u2013 which is why we have recently launched a new innovation in the form of a coffee concentrate in a stick.\n\n\u201cThe convenience factor is strong with these as all consumers need to do is open up the coffee stick, pour over ice \u2013 and that\u2019s all done, they can enjoy a very quick cup of coffee with no need to source hot water to dissolve powder or dilute the coffee unless they want to.\u201d\n\nFoodNavigator-Asia has asked experts in India to weigh in with recommendations for India\u2019s spice sector bounce back from two high profile contamination scandals this year.\n\nCarcinogenic ethylene oxide is a pesticide that was found in spice powders from major Indian brands Everest and MDH, putting the country\u2019s spice industry under intense scrutiny.\n\nThis has led to bans in Hong Kong and the Maldives, product recalls in Singapore, and stricter checks on India\u2019s spices in Australia and the US.\n\nDespite the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) emphasising its stringent regulations, overseas bans and domestic concerns raised questions about the effectiveness of these measures.\n\nFollowing the Hong Kong ban on 5 April, FSSAI issued a statement on 8 April that raised the maximum residue limits (MRL) of pesticides by 10 times from 0.01mg/kg to 0.1mg/kg.\n\nAlthough FSSAI clarified that these only applies to pesticides not registered with the Indian authorities, and that the international Codex standards were adhered to, it sparked criticism and confusion.\n\n\u201cIt does seem counterintuitive for the FSSAI to increase the MRL for pesticides not registered with authorities, especially considering the potential health implications,\u201d Equinox Labs CEO Ashwin Bhadri said.\n\n\u201cThe implications of such a decision could be significant, as it may lead to increased pesticide residues in food products, potentially impacting consumer health in the long term.\n\n\u201cIt may also raise doubts about the effectiveness of regulatory measures in ensuring food safety and quality.\u201d\n\nThe Indonesian government has revised food packaging regulations in response to consumer and academic concerns over the presence of dangerous chemicals entering the food supply chain.\n\nAs of 2023, Indonesia had no specific regulations in place regarding certain harmful chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), more commonly known as the \u2018Forever Chemicals\u2019 due to their slow degradation rate.\n\nA great deal of scientific evidence already linked PFAS exposure to an array of health issues from cancer, cardiovascular disease, infertility, elevated blood pressure and more.\n\n\u201cIndonesia currently has no regulations on PFAS in food packaging [but] the troubling findings from our study indicate that we need stronger regulations to protect our children and families from exposures to toxic PFAS chemicals especially in daily products,\u201d Nexus3 Senior Advisor Yuyun Ismawati said whilst announcing the study findings.\n\n\u201cPFAS can also be released when people wear clothing, during washing, and when used synthetic textile wastes are disposed \u2013 [this] can contaminate waterways, leading to PFAS exposures from contaminated drinking water or food.\u201d\n\nFoodNavigator-Asia took a closer look at five of the top trends affecting the Asia Pacific food and beverage industry in 2024.\n\nThese included the \u2018premium affordability\u2019 trend surfaced by many food firms, as well as the evolution of plant-based protein to moving away from mimicry in innovation.\n\nOther significant trends included the rise of ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages driven by convenience and relatability, the continuous rise of low-to-no alcohol, and major factors behind the growth of the snacking industry.\n\nThe European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) has faced major pushback from ministers and trade organisations within Europe, as well as alongside continued pressure from palm oil producer nations in Asia this year.\n\nOn March 28 2024, an industry-wide cross-commodity letter was addressed to EC President of the Council for Environment and Minister for the Climate, the Environment, Sustainable Development and the Green Deal of Belgium Zakia Khattabi, calling for \u2018urgent clarifications and workable solutions\u2019 on EUDR implementation.\n\nThis was signed by a coalition of more than 20 European industry organisations spanning many areas of trade, including representatives on food trade in cereals, oils, rice, livestock, meat and more \u2013 all highlighting concerns over the supposed enforcement in December 2024.\n\n\u201cConsidering the significant adjustments that are needed from suppliers, operators and traders, we would like to express serious concerns regarding the pace of preparation of EUDR-related legislative acts, the mandatory systems and the guidance and clarifications required for implementation,\u201d the coalition said in the letter, which FoodNavigator-Asia has viewed.\n\n\u201cOperators and traders are working hard to prepare their supply chains and adapt their systems and due diligence processes for compliance with the EUDR [and] try to develop workable solutions compatible with the EUDR provisions.\n\n\u201cHowever, these efforts are impeded by large gaps in information, lack of appropriate technical solutions and by misconceptions as to the functioning of our complex chains.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean government has planned to mandate label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, replacing this with a digital QR code system over the next two years.\n\nSouth Korea committed to a range of sustainability goals, including the slashing of plastic waste production by 50% and the doubling of recycling rates in the country from 34% to 70%, both by 2030.\n\nThis year\u2019s developments saw the ministry calling for public comment on an initiative to mandate the use of label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, to be implemented after a two-year transition period.\n\n\u201cIn order to reduce the amount of label waste in the country from drinking water bottles and improve the efficiency of recycling systems locally, we will introduce a new label-free QR code system for all such bottles,\u201d MoE said via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cFrom January 1 2026, all individual types of drinking water bottles such as mineral waters that are manufactured in Korea will be subject to this change.\n\n\u201cAs the label-free QR code display method is mandated for target audiences, we aim to start with a smooth trial operation and early conversion [in order to] reflect any industry difficulties regarding displaying any necessary sales information via the QR code, as well as to determine the scope for product promotion and advertising.\u201d\n\nGlobal food corporation Cargill has leveraged its cocoa-sourcing networks in Asia and other business units to support customers in overcoming the cocoa supply shortage, and ensure consumers continue to have access to chocolate products.\n\nAccording to the International Cocoa Organization, global cocoa supply is projected to decline by nearly 11% to 4.449m tonnes in the 2023-2024 season, compared with 2022-23.\n\nThis is primarily caused by \u201ccatastrophic harvests\u201d in Ghana and Ivory Coast, which are responsible for over 60% of the world\u2019s cocoa supply.\n\nIn the face of this crisis, Cargill has drawn on its extensive cocoa sourcing networks and innovation expertise to help customers address current challenges, and ensure consumers still get to enjoy chocolate products.\n\n\u201cCocoa supply is indeed a pressing issue for the industry. Cargill is a bean-to-bar solutions provider, which means that we have the capabilities to innovate along every step of the value chain, from sourcing of raw materials to product customisation and solutions provision. For example, we are able to provide Asian-sourced cocoa products as we source globally.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are actively reaching out to our customers to see if they need support in managing this situation, such as sourcing, alternative recipes and product trials. We are able to tailor-make cocoa powder for a certain flavour and colour, and combine different ingredients to create new solutions or replacements,\u201d Xiaoling Liu, Indulgence Leader, Food Solutions Asia Pacific at Cargill, told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nThe EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) has faced pressure from within its own Parliament to postpone implementation as an \u2018urgent\u2019 matter this year, with concerns over key trade commodities such as palm oil and cocoa.\n\nThe EUDR received much criticism particularly from palm oil industry experts and countries producing key commodities likely to be affected such as palm oil, cocoa and coffee, and came under fire from within the EU parliament as well.\n\nThis dissent was led by European Peoples\u2019 Party (EPP) environmental spokesperson Peter Liese, who pushed for an \u2018urgent\u2019 postponement and \u2018far less bureaucratic\u2019 implementation of the EUDR.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the EUDR is correct, but its implementation is far too bureaucratic [and] the European Commission absolutely must postpone the entry into force of the deforestation regulation, then use the transitional period to reduce bureaucracy in the text,\u201d he said via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cWe must do something about deforestation worldwide and take our responsibility seriously, [however] the regulation has been turned into a bureaucratic monster - Many small farmers around the world and even small forest owners in the European Union cannot work with the text.\n\n\u201cThe preparatory work that the Commission should have carried out has not been done [and many] countries are complaining massively about the legislation, including countries that are pursuing the same goal as we are, namely to stop deforestation.\n\nAs of time of writing, the EUDR implementation has been postponed to the end of 2025.\n\nResearchers in India have highlighted that the misuse of antibiotics in food animal production in Asia could pose a serious danger to public health in the region.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a significant global threat, causing substantial economic losses and an estimated annual loss of 700,000 lives.\n\nResearchers at the Veterinary and Animal Sciences University in Punjab noted the alarming rise of antibiotic resistance and its potential transmission to humans through the food chain.\n\nThey also shed light on the pervasive use of critically important antibiotics in food animal production across Asia as well as how limited surveillance and regulatory controls had amplified concerns over antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe study encompassed 11 WHO member countries \u2014 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste.\n\nResults from the review of 108 selected publications revealed a staggering 1,126 scientific publications on antibiotic use in food animals, wherein the study identified a concerning trend of antibiotic misuse in livestock, poultry and aquaculture.\n\nChina\u2019s removal of tariffs on all dairy products from New Zealand has been posited to spell huge potential for brands with a strong focus on quality and sustainability.\n\nChina and New Zealand signed a free trade agreement (FTA) in 2008, but with regard to dairy it took 16 years to finally see all tariffs removed.\n\nAccording to New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade data, New Zealand was the first developed country in the world to enter into an FTA with China.\n\nVarious New Zealand dairy products have seen export tariff decreases over the years, but although many of these hit zero in 2019, duties were still in place for liquid milk, butter and cheese until 2021; and for milk powder until Dec 31 2023.\n\nAs of Jan 1 this year, all tariffs were officially declared to have been removed by the Chinese Embassy in New Zealand via a formal statement, which was warmly welcomed by New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay.\n\n\u201cAll safeguard duties on milk powder [entering China] have been removed as of January 1 2024, which marks the final liberalisation of dairy access under the [China-New Zealand] FTA,\u201d McClay announced via a separate statement."

According to a recent Gartner report, 70% of companies that successfully apply observability will gain a competitive edge through faster problem identification and enhanced decision-making.\n\nHowever, as application development has progressed from monolith stacks to microservices, and user expectations have shifted toward instant digital experiences, companies have accumulated a mix of observability tools, each tailored to different parts of their tech stack. This hodgepodge raises costs, complicates data analysis, and slows issue resolution.\n\nThe Kloudfuse observability platform addresses these challenges by building on three foundational principles: unification, cost optimization, and intelligent automation. Here\u2019s a closer look at the observability landscape, the unique challenges organizations face today, and how Kloudfuse is designed to provide a unified, affordable, and intelligent approach to modern observability."

            "article_content": "The recent market shifts reveal contrasting trends \u2014 Solana price forecast suggests further dips, as the coin drops from $263.83 to $185, with predictions pointing to a bearish trend. Meanwhile, Binance coin (BNB) security remains a focal point for investors, emphasizing advanced protection mechanisms amidst increasing scrutiny.\n\nOn the other side, BlockDAG (BDAG) offers a compelling edge with its recent dashboard upgrade that comes with a limited-time 5-tier bonus system. Starting with an impressive 150% bonus on the first purchase, the rewards grow even bigger as buyers proceed. This utility-focused project has also exceeded expectations by raising over $171 million in its presale, firmly establishing itself as one of the crypto coins to watch right now.\n\nSolana Price Forecast: Will It Recover After 18% Drop to $185?\n\nSolana recently achieved an all-time high of $263.83 but quickly dropped by 16%, trading at $224.92. Market predictions suggest further declines, with a low of $215 anticipated this week. It has struggled to maintain its upward momentum, raising concerns among its community.\n\nDespite its large market cap of $107.94 billion, short-term forecasts paint a bearish picture, and recovery to its peak may take time. While optimism persists among long-term supporters, the Solana price forecast reflects ongoing challenges that cast uncertainty over its immediate performance.\n\nExamining Binance Coin (BNB) Security Features\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) is widely recognized for its robust security features, including advanced encryption and Proof of Stake mechanisms. Binance coin (BNB) security is further reinforced by two-factor authentication (2FA), offering an additional layer of user protection.\n\nHowever, concerns about regulatory scrutiny and centralized dependencies weigh heavily on BNB. Recent legal challenges, including investigations by major authorities, have heightened uncertainty about its long-term prospects. Moreover, analysts argue that its reliance on the Binance ecosystem raises questions about decentralization.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s 5-Tier Gamified Bonuses to End on January 8!\n\nCrypto enthusiasts often seek opportunities where their investments yield more than expected, and BlockDAG\u2019s latest dashboard upgrade delivers exactly that. By introducing an innovative 5-tier bonus system, BlockDAG has created a unique reward structure that turns every purchase into a step toward greater returns, redefining the way buyers engage with their holdings.\n\nUsing the BDAG250 code, buyers can start with a 150% bonus on their first purchase, followed by an even bigger 170% bonus on the second. But the excitement doesn\u2019t stop there\u2014\u201dmystery boxes\u201d reveal hidden bonuses as users make additional purchases. Each step unlocks higher rewards, making the process both thrilling and highly rewarding.\n\nThis gamified bonus structure has quickly become one of the most talked-about features in the crypto market, giving participants a unique incentive to grow their portfolios. But here\u2019s the catch: the bonus offer is set to end on January 8, making now the perfect time to take advantage of these incredible rewards.\n\nMoreover, BlockDAG\u2019s presale success underscores its growing dominance in the market, with over $168.5 million raised by selling more than 17.4 billion BDAG coins. Early BDAG holders have already seen their stakes multiply, as the price has surged 2,240% from its starting point of $0.001 to $0.0234 in batch 26.\n\nFor those looking to become a part of this rising crypto star, now could be the ideal time, as the BDAG coins are still available at affordable prices of a mere $0.0234. Yet, this low-entry price won\u2019t be around for long, as the current batch is nearing its close, setting the stage for a significant price increase in the next batch.\n\nCrypto Coins to Watch Now in the Market\n\nWhile Solana price forecast suggests further dips to $215 and Binance coin (BNB) security faces regulatory scrutiny, BlockDAG is charting a different course. With its innovative 5-tier bonus system and the use of the BDAG250 code, BlockDAG offers up to 170% bonuses, transforming user engagement and rewards.\n\nThe project has already raised $168.5 million in its presale, with prices surging 2,240% in just a couple of months. As the current batch nears completion, prices are set to rise in the next round. For those seeking crypto coins to watch now for massive gains, BlockDAG\u2019s record-breaking momentum and unique incentives make it a standout choice.\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu"

            "article_content": "Right whales are among the rarest whales on Earth, and their populations are highly endangered. Now, scientists say some of the gentle giants may live nearly twice as long as previously thought. The new findings, published December 20 in the journal Science Advances, make southern right whales the mammal with the second-longest known life span, behind only the bowhead whale. The findings\u2014and the novel methods used to achieve them\u2014could help inform conservation efforts moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking about these whales all wrong,\u201d says study co-author Peter Corkeron, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia, to the Guardian\u2019s Petra Stock. \u201cIt\u2019s impeded our ability to get it right when it comes to doing the science for conservation to stop these whales from going extinct.\u201d\n\nEstimating the age of some individual whales is relatively easy. For example, a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) killed in 2007 had a harpoon tip stuck in its blubber that was manufactured in the late 1800s, allowing researchers to surmise it was at least 115 years old.\n\nBut deducing the average life expectancy of an entire species can be more challenging. For one, past methods\u2014such as analyzing their earwax, which builds up each year like the rings of a tree\u2014have required whales to be dead. In addition, commercial whaling was so intense throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that most of the largest, oldest animals were likely missing from researchers\u2019 calculations. Most of today\u2019s longevity estimates are probably skewed by an overrepresentation of younger whales, the team writes in the paper.\n\nSo, for the new study, researchers deployed some new tactics. Using photos of right whales dating back to the 1970s, they identified individual females based on their appearance and noted when they stopped showing up in photos, presumably because they died. Then, they incorporated this information into statistical models that are similar to those used by life insurance companies to estimate human life expectancy.\n\nThese novel methods are \u201cquite impressive,\u201d as C. Scott Baker, an ecologist at Oregon State University who was not involved with the paper, tells Science\u2019s Mitch Leslie. \u201cThey make a good case for the plausibility of their results.\u201d\n\nThe findings suggest southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) have a median lifespan of about 73 years. But up to 10 percent might live to be 131 years old\u2014and a handful may even approach 150. That\u2019s much higher than previous estimates, which suggested the marine mammals had a maximum life expectancy between 70 and 80 years.\n\nResearchers used the same techniques for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), a critically endangered species with an estimated 372 individuals remaining. The study finds that North Atlantic right whales have a median lifespan of just 22 years, with the longest-living 10 percent surpassing the age of 47.\n\nOverall, the findings reinforce the idea that these animals are still bouncing back from the damage wrought by commercial whaling, a practice that ended less than four decades ago.\n\n\u201cTo attain healthy populations that include old animals, recovery might take hundreds of years,\u201d says study lead author Greg Breed, an ecologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, in a statement. \u201cFor animals that live to be 100 or 150 and only give birth to a surviving calf every 10 years or so, slow recovery is to be expected.\u201d\n\nWhy such a big life expectancy gap between southern and North Atlantic right whales? Scientists suspect North Atlantic right whales are much more vulnerable because of where they live. They primarily inhabit Atlantic coastal waters near Canada and the United States\u2014a bustling region with lots of commercial activity.\n\nThis month alone, three North Atlantic right whales were seen tangled in fishing gear off the East Coast of the U.S. They\u2019re also susceptible to boat strikes and climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a maze of rope these animals need to get through, and there\u2019s huge ports coming into the U.S., there\u2019s lots of shipping,\u201d Corkeron tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s Sam Bradbrook and Samantha Goerling.\n\nThe Southern Ocean, meanwhile, is not nearly as congested. One takeaway from the study is that \u201cit\u2019s important to keep it that way,\u201d Corkeron adds.\n\nMoving forward, researchers say their methods could be applied to other species, such as blue, fin, sei, humpback, gray and sperm whales. And, in the meantime, their recent findings could lead to the development of more effective conservation plans.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how long wild animals live has major implications for how to best protect them,\u201d Corkeron and Breed write in the Conversation. \u201cAnimals that have very long lifespans usually reproduce extremely slowly and can go many years between births. \u2026 Conservation and management strategies that do not plan accordingly will have a higher chance of failure. This is especially important given the expected impacts of climate disruption.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will zoom by the sun on Tuesday during a record-breaking flyby, coming within 3.8 million miles (6.1 million kilometers) of the solar surface during humanity\u2019s closest approach to a star.\n\nThe uncrewed spacecraft will fly at 430,000 miles per hour (692,000 kilometers per hour), which is fast enough to reach Tokyo from Washington, DC, in under a minute, according to NASA. The speedy flyby will make the probe the fastest human-made object in history, the agency shared December 16 during a NASA Science Live presentation on YouTube.\n\nThe mission has been building up to this historic milestone since it launched on August 12, 2018 \u2014 an event attended by the probe\u2019s namesake, Dr. Eugene Parker, an astrophysicist who pioneered the solar research field of heliophysics.\n\nDr. Eugene Parker is pictured with a model of the Parker Solar Probe on May 31, 2017. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nParker was the first living person to have a spacecraft named after him. The astrophysicist, whose research revolutionized humanity\u2019s understanding of the sun and interplanetary space, died at age 94 in March 2022. But he was still able to witness how the spacecraft could help solve mysteries about the sun more than 65 years after the mission was originally envisioned.\n\nThe probe became the first spacecraft to \u201ctouch the sun\u201d by successfully flying through the sun\u2019s corona, or upper atmosphere, to sample particles and our star\u2019s magnetic fields in December 2021.\n\nOver the last six years of the spacecraft\u2019s seven-year mission, the Parker Solar Probe has collected data to enlighten scientists about some of the sun\u2019s greatest mysteries.\n\nHeliophysicists have long wondered how the solar wind, a constant stream of particles released by the sun, is generated as well as why the sun\u2019s corona is so much hotter than its surface.\n\nAn animation shows the solar wind streaming away from the sun, across the solar system and encountering Earth. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nScientists also want to understand how coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, are structured.\n\nWhen these ejections are aimed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of the planet\u2019s magnetic field, that can affect satellites as well as power and communication infrastructure on Earth.\n\nNow, the time has come for Parker\u2019s closest and final flybys, which could complete the answers to these enduring questions and uncover new mysteries by exploring uncharted solar territory.\n\n\u201cParker Solar Probe is changing the field of heliophysics,\u201d said Helene Winters, Parker Solar Probe\u2019s project manager from Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Applied Physics Laboratory, in a statement. \u201cAfter years of braving the heat and dust of the inner solar system, taking blasts of solar energy and radiation that no spacecraft has ever seen, Parker Solar Probe continues to thrive.\u201d\n\nA blisteringly close flyby of a fiery star\n\nParker\u2019s flyby at around 6:53 a.m. ET on Christmas Eve will be the first of the spacecraft\u2019s final three closest approaches, with the other two expected to occur on March 22 and June 19.\n\nThe spacecraft will be so close that if the distance between Earth and the sun were the length of an American football field, the spacecraft would be about 4 yards from the end zone, according to NASA.\n\nAt this proximity, the probe will be able to fly through plumes of plasma as well as within a solar eruption if one releases from the sun.\n\nThe spacecraft encountered a coronal mass ejection on September 5, 2022. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nThe spacecraft was built to withstand the extremes of the sun and has flown through coronal mass ejections in the past with no impact to the vehicle, said Parker Solar Probe project scientist Nour Rawafi.\n\nThe spacecraft is equipped with a carbon foam shield that is 4.5 inches (11.4 centimeters) thick and 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide. On Earth before launch, the shield was tested and able to withstand temperatures near 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (nearly 1,400 degrees Celsius). On Christmas Eve, the shield could face temperatures up to 1,800 F (980 degrees C).\n\nMeanwhile, the spacecraft\u2019s interior will be at a comfortable room temperature so the electronics systems and science instruments can operate as expected. A unique cooling system designed by the Applied Physics Laboratory pumps water through the craft\u2019s solar arrays to keep them at a steady temperature of 320 F (160 C), even during close approaches to the sun.\n\nAn animation depicts Parker Solar Probe's close pass near the intense heat of the sun. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nThe spacecraft will conduct its flyby autonomously because mission control will be out of contact with the probe due to its proximity to the sun.\n\nAfter the closest approach, around midnight between Thursday and Friday, Parker will send a signal called a beacon tone back to mission control to confirm the success of the flyby, Rawafi said.\n\nThe beacon tone is a limited piece of data that relays the overall state of the spacecraft, he said.\n\nThe immense set of data and images gathered during the flyby won\u2019t become available to mission control until Parker has moved away from the sun in its orbit, which will occur about three weeks later in mid-January, Rawafi said.\n\nPerfect timing to see an active sun\n\nJust over a year after the Parker Solar Probe first launched, the sun entered a new solar cycle. Now, as Parker makes its closest approach, the sun is experiencing solar maximum, meaning that the mission has had a chance to witness most of a solar cycle and the transitions between its highs and lows, said Dr. C. Alex Young, associate director for science in the Heliophysics Science Division at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nThe sun is much more active during solar maximum, as seen in this comparison of solar phases. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nScientists from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the international Solar Cycle Prediction Panel announced in October that the sun has reached solar maximum, or the peak of activity within its 11-year cycle.\n\nAt the peak of the solar cycle, the sun\u2019s magnetic poles flip, causing the sun to transition from calm to active. Experts track increasing solar activity by counting how many sunspots appear on the sun\u2019s surface. And the sun is expected to remain active for the next year or so.\n\nThe sun\u2019s increasing activity became obvious this year during two major displays of auroras on Earth in May and October, when coronal mass ejections released by the sun were directed at our planet. The solar storms are also responsible for generating auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky.\n\nAn array of colors can be seen during an auroral display visible from the International Space Station. NASA\n\n\u201cBoth of those storms caused auroras to be visible down to the very bottom of the United States,\u201d Young said. \u201cBut the May storm was an especially strong storm. In fact, we think it could be a 100- to possibly 500-year event, and that caused auroras very close to the equator, which is extremely unheard of. It was a worldwide event that millions and, hopefully billions, of people, were able to see, and it may not happen again.\u201d\n\nThe data gathered by Parker Solar Probe could enable scientists to better understand solar storms and even how to predict them, Young said.\n\n\u201cThe sun is the only star that we can see in detail, but we can actually go to and measure it directly,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s a laboratory in our solar system that allows us to learn about all the other stars in the universe and how all those stars interact with the billions and billions of other planets that may or may not be like our own planets in our solar system.\u201d\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will continue orbiting closely to the sun over the next six months. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nWith that in mind, Rawafi said he hopes that the sun puts on a spectacular show during the probe\u2019s close approaches, enabling scientists to gain insights into the sun\u2019s activity.\n\n\u201cSun, please do your best,\u201d Rawafi said. \u201cGive us the strongest event you can do, and the Parker Solar Probe can deal with it.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Today, the push for efficiency is more than just a goal- it's a necessity. Organizations are accelerating efforts to streamline processes, empower teams, and boost productivity to stay ahead of the curve. When workflows are streamlined, productivity increases, enabling organizations to scale effectively and adapt to the demands of an evolving market. AI is fundamentally centered on data\u2014training on the right data, ensuring secure access, and continuously refining this data is critical to meaningful AI-driven insights and automation success. Gartner predicts that by 2026, 30% of enterprises will automate over half of their network activities, reflecting a shift toward automation-driven efficiency. This trend not only enhances daily operations but also fosters a culture of growth and innovation, essential for staying competitive in a data-centric landscape.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nData services are an essential part of this transformation. They are persistent data storage services that bring powerful no-code data modeling and storage capabilities to your Robotic Process Automation (RPA) projects. Whether it\u2019s managing large data sets, automating data analysis, or simplifying access across departments, data services streamline the flow of information throughout an organization. They fit seamlessly into automation strategies, helping to reduce the manual effort needed for data handling and providing a foundation for predictive analytics, personalized customer experiences, and process improvements.\n\nThe Role of No-Code Data Services in Modern Automation\n\nTraditionally, handling data required technical expertise and complex configurations, which became even more challenging amid a talent shortage in automation-ready skills. No-code data services address this gap by offering a user-friendly approach that empowers business users, or citizen developers, to drive automation projects independently. Through simple, drag-and-drop functionality, data sets, files, and resources can be seamlessly incorporated into workflows without coding, while security and data consistency are maintained automatically.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAs organizations increasingly adopt automation, a no-code approach in data services becomes pivotal. It enables seamless integration with existing automation tools, allowing teams to manage, analyze, and access data across departments without relying heavily on IT support. By simplifying data handling, no-code data services make information more accessible and actionable, equipping organizations to provide real-time insights and solutions.\n\nA Practical Example: Monthly Financial Reporting\n\nIn monthly financial reporting, data from multiple systems, including bookings, invoices, billings, and payments, must be gathered. Without a centralized solution, both attended and unattended workflows retrieve data individually, requiring users to access all backend systems, leading to delays and potential inconsistencies. By setting up an unattended workflow to gather data in Data Service, other workflows can access this information consistently and efficiently. This eliminates the need for multiple data pulls, streamlines the reporting process, and mitigates issues related to data changes during the reporting cycle. Moreover, it removes the need to store aggregated data locally, enhancing data security and consistency across systems.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHow Enterprises Benefit from No-Code Data Services\n\nUnified Data Integration for Seamless Access: These services simplify the process of integrating data from disparate sources. By consolidating data from legacy platforms, enterprise systems, and custom applications into a single, secure repository, businesses can maintain data consistency and reliability across automations.\n\nStreamlined Data Reusability Across Automations: No-code data services offer a centralized data hub that makes information accessible and reusable across multiple automation projects. This eliminates the need for building separate connections for each workflow, enabling consistent data schemas and shareable variables through intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.\n\nScaling with Growth: As automation initiatives expand, the demand for scalable data solutions grows. No-code data services provide limitless capacity through secure platforms like Automation Cloud, allowing businesses to confidently scale their automation projects without sacrificing performance or security.\n\nEnhanced Security and Governance: Security remains a priority in a data-driven world. No-code data services help mitigate risks by transitioning sensitive information from local systems to a secure, centralized platform. With role-based access controls, organizations can manage data access and usage, ensuring that data governance remains intact.\n\nNo-Code as a Launchpad for Citizen Developers\n\nAdvertisment\n\nCitizen developers are crucial players in the digital transformation journey. Through no-code data services, employees in finance, marketing, HR, and customer service can independently create automated solutions, significantly enhancing productivity for themselves and their teams. With their deep understanding of daily operations and the potential impact of automation, they drive efficiency from the ground up, fostering continuous innovation and improvement.\n\nBy 2025, Gartner anticipates that 70% of new enterprise applications will harness low-code or no-code technologies\u2014a significant move reshaping the future of software development. This shift isn\u2019t just about innovation; it's a game-changer, empowering teams to drive transformation at pace, with greater flexibility and responsiveness. As organizations embrace these dynamic solutions, they\u2019re not only streamlining operations but also paving the way for transformative breakthroughs that redefine their impact.\n\nAttributed to Prashant Momaya, Senior Director of Sales Engineering, UiPath India"

            "article_content": "ZDNET\n\nIt was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was the age of wise development. It was the age of open-source business foolishness. It was the spring of AI hope. It was the winter of security despair.\n\nThe year 2024 saw major advances in Linux and open-source software development. However, it also witnessed some disturbing open-source business moves that raised concerns about its future.\n\nLet's start with the bad news.\n\n1. Businesses dump open source in search of profits\n\nCompany after company abandoned their open-source roots to seek money with prosperity licenses and trademarks.\n\nFor all practical purposes, all software is built using open source. By Synopsys' count, 96% of all codebases contain open-source software. But all too often in recent years, once a business has established itself with open source, it dumps its code's open-source licenses for semi-proprietary licenses such as the Server Side Public License (SSPL) and the Business Source License (BSL) 1.1.\n\nAlso: The open-source tools that could disrupt the entire IT incident management market\n\nThis trend has included companies such as Cockroach Labs, Confluent, MongoDB, Elastic, MariaDB, Redis Labs, and HashiCorp. The list goes on and on and grows ever larger.\n\nStill, other businesses compromise their open-source licenses by locking down their code with delayed open-source publication (DOSP). These companies include GitButler, Sentry, and Snowplow. Here, the name of the game is to promise that their code will be released under an open-source license at some point in the future.\n\nA new anti-open-source movement has been started by WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg, who founded and is the CEO of Automattic. In this case, the code is still open source, but he's demanding that one WordPress hosting company, WP-Engine, must pay 8% of its net profits for using the WordPress trademark. Rumor is he'll be making similar demands on other WordPress companies. Just this last week, it appears that WordPress is threatening to cripple all new and updated third-party WordPress themes and plugins. This is not how open source is supposed to work.\n\nAlso: If ChatGPT produces AI-generated code for your app, who does it really belong to?\n\nWhat I find most annoying about all these efforts to squeeze profits from open source is there's no proof whatsoever of changing licenses or otherwise restricting them. Indeed, a study by Redmonk analyst Rachel Stevens, which examined several companies that made such license changes, found their growth rate remained the same as it was before the change. In addition, market capitalization results were mixed, with only MongoDB showing significant growth while valuations for others, such as HashiCorp, dropped.\n\nNow, open source has never been a business model, but it's essential for developing software. Companies that don't recognize its vital importance to their future efforts will find themselves unable to progress in tomorrow's markets.\n\n2. Major Linux security vulnerabilities avoided\n\nOn a more positive note, a potentially catastrophic security breach was narrowly avoided when Microsoft developer Andres Freund discovered a backdoor in XZ Utils, a widely used Linux data compression utility. The backdoor, which could have compromised millions of computers, was inserted by a malicious actor who had spent years gaining trust within the open-source community. This incident highlighted the sophisticated threats facing open-source projects and the importance of vigilant code review.\n\nAlso: Leaving Windows 10 for Linux? 5 security differences to consider first\n\nThis catch underlines, though, that we must spend a lot more time on securing open-source software development. The OpenSSF's Open Source Consumption Manifesto may serve as the foundation for establishing this approach. Something must be done. Open source is vital to all software now.\n\n3. CentOS replacements gain traction and Linux continues to rule\n\nFollowing Red Hat's withdrawal of support for CentOS, a host of CentOS replacements has arisen. In 2024, they came of age. AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux emerged as prominent replacements for the numerous businesses that had relied on CentOS. These businesses have filled the void left by CentOS by providing stable, community-driven enterprise Linux distributions.\n\nWith its CentOS-friendly replacement, Liberty Linux, SUSE is also doing well. SUSE's own Linux family, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), is growing. Liberty, Rocky, and Oracle Linux are also now built on the new Open Enterprise Linux Association (OpenELA) codebase. This project's goal is to create a truly open-source enterprise Linux that's compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).\n\nAlso: Want to save your old computer? Try these 6 Linux distros\n\nThis isn't to say that Red Hat is hurting. It's not. The biggest commercial Linux distribution is doing just fine. IBM's Red Hat acquisition has proven to be arguably IBM's most successful acquisition ever.\n\nArvind Krishna, IBM's CEO, claimed that Red Hat had doubled in size since its acquisition and saw a 14% growth rate in its last quarter. According to IBM CFO James Kavanaugh, OpenShift, Red Hat's Kubernetes distro, and the Ansible DevOps program both grew at more than 20% year over year, with the core Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) disto business growing \"in the double digits.\"\n\nIndeed, put it all together, and it's clear that without Red Hat, IBM would be struggling to make a profit.\n\n4. AI and open source go together like bread and butter\n\nWithout open source, there is no AI. It's that simple. In their search for profits, though, AI companies -- with the notable exception of IBM with its Granite models -- like to give open source a lot more lip service than they do to releasing their code and models under an open-source license. Yes, I'm looking at you, Meta, with your Llama.\n\nThat said, open source doesn't fit easily with AI. If you don't believe me, just look at the endless fights over the Open Source Initiative's (OSI) Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) 1.0. We may have an \"official\" open-source definition, but we are nowhere close to an agreement about how valid OSAID is.\n\nAlso: IBM's new enterprise AI models are more powerful than anything from OpenAI or Google\n\nWhile the details are still being worked out, there can be no question whatsoever that AI and open source will continue to work together. AI's foundations are built from open-source programs such as Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, and Tensorflow. Without these programs and others, none of the AI programs you use every day -- such as ChatGPT -- would exist.\n\n5. Real-time Linux made it into mainstream Linux\n\nIt took 20 years -- no, really! -- but Real-Time Linux (PREEMPT_RT) is finally in the mainline kernel.\n\nAnd what is a real-time operating system (RTOS), you ask? It's a specialized operating system designed to handle time-critical tasks with precision and reliability. Unlike general-purpose operating systems like Windows or MacOS an RTOS is designed to respond to events and process data within strict time constraints, often measured in milliseconds or microseconds.\n\nAlso: 20 years later, real-time Linux makes it to the kernel - really\n\nMany people assume that RTOSs are for fast processes. They're not. Speed is not the point of RTOSs -- reliability is. This feature is crucial in applications where timing is everything, such as industrial control systems, medical devices, and aerospace equipment.\n\nThis opens up a new field of devices for Linux. Going forward, we'll see numerous new real-time hardware gadgets running Linux.\n\nLooking ahead, I see all these trends continuing, for better or worse. It's my sincere hope that it will all, in the end, work out for the best."

            "article_content": "The latest AI model from OpenAI achieved an \u201cimpressive leap in performance\u201d but it still hasn\u2019t demonstrated what experts classify as human-level intelligence\n\nOpenAI announced a breakthrough achievement for its new o3 AI model Rokas Tenys / Alamy\n\nOpenAI\u2019s new o3 artificial intelligence model has achieved a breakthrough high score on a prestigious AI reasoning test called the ARC Challenge, inspiring some AI fans to speculate that o3 has achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI). But even as ARC Challenge organisers described o3\u2019s achievement as a major milestone, they also cautioned that it has not won the competition\u2019s grand prize \u2013 and it is only one step on the path towards AGI, a term for hypothetical future AI with human-like intelligence.\n\nThe o3 model is the latest in a line of AI releases that follow on from the large language models powering ChatGPT. \u201cThis is a surprising and important step-function increase in AI capabilities, showing novel task adaptation ability never seen before in the GPT-family models,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, an engineer at Google and the main creator of the ARC Challenge, in a blog post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat did OpenAI\u2019s o3 model actually do?\n\nChollet designed the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) Challenge in 2019 to test how well AIs can find correct patterns linking pairs of coloured grids. Such visual puzzles are intended to make AIs demonstrate a form of general intelligence with basic reasoning capabilities. But throwing enough computing power at the puzzles could let even a non-reasoning program simply solve them through brute force. To prevent this, the competition also requires official score submissions to meet certain limits on computing power.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s newly announced o3 model \u2013 which is scheduled for release in early 2025 \u2013 achieved its official breakthrough score of 75.7 per cent on the ARC Challenge\u2019s \u201csemi-private\u201d test, which is used for ranking competitors on a public leaderboard. The computing cost of its achievement was approximately $20 for each visual puzzle task, meeting the competition\u2019s limit of less than $10,000 total. However, the harder \u201cprivate\u201d test that is used to determine grand prize winners has an even more stringent computing power limit, equivalent to spending just 10 cents on each task, which OpenAI did not meet.\n\nThe o3 model also achieved an unofficial score of 87.5 per cent by applying approximately 172 times more computing power than it did on the official score. For comparison, the typical human score is 84 per cent, and an 85 per cent score is enough to win the ARC Challenge\u2019s $600,000 grand prize \u2013 if the model can also keep its computing costs within the required limits.\n\nSign up to our The Daily newsletter The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nBut to reach its unofficial score, o3\u2019s cost soared to thousands of dollars spent solving each task. OpenAI requested that the challenge organisers not publish the exact computing costs.\n\nDoes this o3 achievement show that AGI has been reached?\n\nNo, the ARC challenge organisers have specifically said they do not consider beating this competition benchmark to be an indicator of having achieved AGI.\n\nThe o3 model also failed to solve more than 100 visual puzzle tasks, even when OpenAI applied a very large amount of computing power toward the unofficial score, said Mike Knoop, an ARC Challenge organiser at software company Zapier, in a social media post on X.\n\nIn a social media post on Bluesky, Melanie Mitchell at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico said the following about o3\u2019s progress on the ARC benchmark: \u201cI think solving these tasks by brute-force compute defeats the original purpose\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile the new model is very impressive and represents a big milestone on the way towards AGI, I don\u2019t believe this is AGI \u2013 there\u2019s still a fair number of very easy [ARC Challenge] tasks that o3 can\u2019t solve,\u201d said Chollet in another X post.\n\nHowever, Chollet described how we might know when human-level intelligence has been demonstrated by some form of AGI. \u201cYou\u2019ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible,\u201d he said in the blog post.\n\nThomas Dietterich at Oregon State University suggests another way to recognise AGI. \u201cThose architectures claim to include all of the functional components required for human cognition,\u201d he says. \u201cBy this measure, the commercial AI systems are missing episodic memory, planning, logical reasoning and, most importantly, meta-cognition.\u201d\n\nSo what does o3\u2019s high score really mean?\n\nThe o3 model\u2019s high score comes as the tech industry and AI researchers have been reckoning with a slower pace of progress in the latest AI models for 2024, compared with the initial explosive developments of 2023.\n\nAlthough it did not win the ARC Challenge, o3\u2019s high score indicates that AI models could beat the competition benchmark in the near future. Beyond its unofficial high score, Chollet says many official low-compute submissions have already scored above 81 per cent on the private evaluation test set.\n\nDietterich also thinks that \u201cthis is a very impressive leap in performance\u201d. However, he cautions that, without knowing more about how OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3 models work, it is impossible to evaluate just how impressive the high score is. For instance, if o3 was able to practise the ARC problems in advance, then that would make its achievement easier. \u201cWe will need to await an open-source replication to understand the full significance of this,\u201d says Dietterich.\n\nThe ARC Challenge organisers are already looking to launch a second and more difficult set of benchmark tests sometime in 2025. They will also keep the ARC Prize 2025 challenge running until someone achieves the grand prize and open-sources their solution."

The rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa\n\nHe has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansj\u00fcrgen K\u00f6hler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (CENAP), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says K\u00f6hler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office CENAP.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nAccording to its director, CENAP has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, K\u00f6hler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact for observers of the inexplicable\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, K\u00f6hler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe founded CENAP as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand.\"\n\nThe organization, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to CENAP has changed dramatically over the decades, K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese Lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nNumber of reports spike thanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organization recorded over 850 cases by October 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups - rocket ignitions - in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun,\" K\u00f6hler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, CENAP records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nThe organization also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the CENAP director.\n\nDo only conspiracy theorists report UFO sightings?\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, K\u00f6hler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship ... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nK\u00f6hler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organization is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nK\u00f6hler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life - or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth.\"\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\"\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa"

            "article_content": "Right whales are among the rarest whales on Earth, and their populations are highly endangered. Now, scientists say some of the gentle giants may live nearly twice as long as previously thought. The new findings, published December 20 in the journal Science Advances, make southern right whales the mammal with the second-longest known life span, behind only the bowhead whale. The findings\u2014and the novel methods used to achieve them\u2014could help inform conservation efforts moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking about these whales all wrong,\u201d says study co-author Peter Corkeron, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia, to the Guardian\u2019s Petra Stock. \u201cIt\u2019s impeded our ability to get it right when it comes to doing the science for conservation to stop these whales from going extinct.\u201d\n\nEstimating the age of some individual whales is relatively easy. For example, a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) killed in 2007 had a harpoon tip stuck in its blubber that was manufactured in the late 1800s, allowing researchers to surmise it was at least 115 years old.\n\nBut deducing the average life expectancy of an entire species can be more challenging. For one, past methods\u2014such as analyzing their earwax, which builds up each year like the rings of a tree\u2014have required whales to be dead. In addition, commercial whaling was so intense throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that most of the largest, oldest animals were likely missing from researchers\u2019 calculations. Most of today\u2019s longevity estimates are probably skewed by an overrepresentation of younger whales, the team writes in the paper.\n\nSo, for the new study, researchers deployed some new tactics. Using photos of right whales dating back to the 1970s, they identified individual females based on their appearance and noted when they stopped showing up in photos, presumably because they died. Then, they incorporated this information into statistical models that are similar to those used by life insurance companies to estimate human life expectancy.\n\nThese novel methods are \u201cquite impressive,\u201d as C. Scott Baker, an ecologist at Oregon State University who was not involved with the paper, tells Science\u2019s Mitch Leslie. \u201cThey make a good case for the plausibility of their results.\u201d\n\nThe findings suggest southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) have a median lifespan of about 73 years. But up to 10 percent might live to be 131 years old\u2014and a handful may even approach 150. That\u2019s much higher than previous estimates, which suggested the marine mammals had a maximum life expectancy between 70 and 80 years.\n\nResearchers used the same techniques for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), a critically endangered species with an estimated 372 individuals remaining. The study finds that North Atlantic right whales have a median lifespan of just 22 years, with the longest-living 10 percent surpassing the age of 47.\n\nOverall, the findings reinforce the idea that these animals are still bouncing back from the damage wrought by commercial whaling, a practice that ended less than four decades ago.\n\n\u201cTo attain healthy populations that include old animals, recovery might take hundreds of years,\u201d says study lead author Greg Breed, an ecologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, in a statement. \u201cFor animals that live to be 100 or 150 and only give birth to a surviving calf every 10 years or so, slow recovery is to be expected.\u201d\n\nWhy such a big life expectancy gap between southern and North Atlantic right whales? Scientists suspect North Atlantic right whales are much more vulnerable because of where they live. They primarily inhabit Atlantic coastal waters near Canada and the United States\u2014a bustling region with lots of commercial activity.\n\nThis month alone, three North Atlantic right whales were seen tangled in fishing gear off the East Coast of the U.S. They\u2019re also susceptible to boat strikes and climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a maze of rope these animals need to get through, and there\u2019s huge ports coming into the U.S., there\u2019s lots of shipping,\u201d Corkeron tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s Sam Bradbrook and Samantha Goerling.\n\nThe Southern Ocean, meanwhile, is not nearly as congested. One takeaway from the study is that \u201cit\u2019s important to keep it that way,\u201d Corkeron adds.\n\nMoving forward, researchers say their methods could be applied to other species, such as blue, fin, sei, humpback, gray and sperm whales. And, in the meantime, their recent findings could lead to the development of more effective conservation plans.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how long wild animals live has major implications for how to best protect them,\u201d Corkeron and Breed write in the Conversation. \u201cAnimals that have very long lifespans usually reproduce extremely slowly and can go many years between births. \u2026 Conservation and management strategies that do not plan accordingly will have a higher chance of failure. This is especially important given the expected impacts of climate disruption.\u201d"
