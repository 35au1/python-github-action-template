            "article_content": "The groundbreaking aspect of the otherwise copycat chatbot was that DeepSeek was created without access to the most advanced semiconductors and at a claimed cost of around $5 million, a tiny fraction of the expense of developing rival AI models. In the stock market, shares of Nvidia, the leading maker of AI chips, dropped 17 percent , while other tech stocks also took a hit.\n\nThe free-of-charge app, launched last week, showed off conversational chops close to the level of ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI offerings from US companies (just don\u2019t ask it questions about Chinese politics ). Over the weekend, DeepSeek rocketed to the most downloaded position in the app stores of Apple and Google.\n\nBy some measures, Boston\u2019s startup ecosystem has been left far behind Silicon Valley in the race to develop artificial intelligence. But the shocking emergence of Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek could actually help Boston catch up.\n\nAs Globe tech columnist Hiawatha Bray noted, DeepSeek published a white paper revealing how it developed the model inexpensively, which should help AI researchers all over the world make advancements more quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDeepSeek is the next piece in the AI arms race,\u201d said computer science professor Elke Rundensteiner at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. \u201cNew AI models like DeepSeek are fuel for launching new startups and accelerating existing ones in New England and beyond.\u201d\n\nSo far, California has dominated Boston and other regions in raising venture capital backing for AI startups. Out west, most of the money has gone to companies developing underlying tech like ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Boston\u2019s ecosystem has focused on building applications that use AI, or in the case of MIT spinoff Liquid AI, creating its own version of much cheaper AI models.\n\nVC Jeff Bussgang at Flybridge Capital Partners sees the plummeting cost of AI as a boon for local startups. \u201cWe saw it with cloud computing and we are seeing it now with AI,\u201d Bussgang said. \u201cAs a result, we will see an explosion of demand and AI-based apps will benefit tremendously.\u201d\n\nCheaper AI could also benefit public companies in the area that have been adding AI features. Shares of HubSpot and Klaviyo have gained about 11 percent each so far this week, as the companies have been incorporating AI services into their marketing and customer service software.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost AI tech may not be quite so beneficial for the stock market at large, where seven tech giants each valued at over $1 trillion dominate market indexes. The fallout could be more severe, and some have drawn parallels to the end of the Internet bubble.\n\nFrom the start of 1995 to March, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite Index increased almost 600 percent. Then over the weekend of March 18, 2000, Barrons magazine published a cover story headlined \u201cBurning Up,\u201d which provided evidence that hundreds of dot com companies would run out of money by year end.\n\nWithin a year, the index had fallen more than 60 percent and didn\u2019t reach 5,000 again for 14 years.\n\nThe leaders of the current tech big seven, including Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and Apple chief executive Tim Cook, all will address Wall Street analysts in coming weeks as they report fourth quarter results. Their responses to the DeepSeek shockwave could make or break the Internet bubble analogy.\n\n\u201cThis is likely to act as an overhang on the technology and energy sectors until a broad array of company management teams provide their own insight/perspectives during the Q4\u201924 earnings season,\u201d a team of analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote on Monday.\n\nAaron Pressman can be reached at aaron.pressman@globe.com.

Known for their expertise in electronic voice phenomena (EVP), the Constantinos brought a unique blend of humour and skill to the show, making them fan favourites. However, beneath their on-screen chemistry lay a troubled relationship marked by domestic strife.\n\nGhost Adventures stars. Photo: @GhostAdventures (modified by author)\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nMark and Debby Constantino were notable figures in the paranormal investigation community, particularly recognised for their Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) expertise. They gained fame by appearing on the Travel Channel's popular series Ghost Adventures, where they contributed to various episodes by capturing purported ghostly voices and sounds.\n\nWhat happened to the Constantino couple?\n\nOn a quiet September morning in 2015, in the eerie silence of Sparks, Nevada, the news of the Ghost Adventures couple found dead in Nevada broke out. The couple (Mark and Debby Constantino) had a darker side to their story.\n\nTheir journey from paranormal enthusiasts to tragic figures unfolded with a backdrop of domestic violence and legal battles, culminating in an event that left the paranormal community and fans of the show in disbelief and mourning.\n\nBackground and rise to fame\n\nMark and Debby Constantino were initially celebrated for their work in electronic voice phenomena (EVP), a method used in paranormal research to capture the voices of spirits on recording devices. They appeared on Ghost Adventures, where they helped analyse audio evidence for signs of ghostly communication.\n\nTheir work was not only a part of the show's appeal but also contributed significantly to the field of paranormal investigation, making them beloved figures in this niche community. Their dynamic, often seen as playful banter on the show, made their appearances memorable. However, there were signs of a troubled relationship behind this public persona.\n\nDomestic strife and public records\n\nThe Constantinos' relationship had a history of domestic violence, which became public knowledge through several court documents and police reports.\n\n2012 incident\n\nMark filed for a temporary restraining order against Debby, claiming he feared she might stab him while intoxicated. He withdrew the request the following day, but this incident was the first public hint of their domestic issues.\n\nAugust 2015\n\nA more severe incident led to Mark being charged with kidnapping, domestic battery by strang, and domestic battery. That stemmed from an altercation where Mark allegedly dragged Debby from a car, leading to her filing for divorce and seeking a protective order. Their daughter, Raquel, was also implicated in this incident.\n\n10 September 2015\n\nDebby filed for divorce from Mark, citing his control over their finances and alleging that he was \"bleeding the accounts dry.\" She sought spousal support and the return of their business, which she claimed to have created.\n\nThe Constantinos had a long history of domestic abuse allegations against each other, including multiple restraining orders filed over the years. Debby had previously accused Mark of severe physical abuse, claiming he had beaten and strangled her during confrontations.\n\nIn one instance, she described being dragged from her car and assaulted until police officers intervened. Mark and Debby's history of violence was well-documented in court records and was known to local law enforcement. Both had filed protective orders against each other at various times, indicating a deeply troubled relationship that escalated over time.\n\nThese events painted a starkly different picture from their on-screen camaraderie, revealing a relationship fraught with violence and legal battles.\n\nThe final days\n\nThe events leading to their deaths unfolded tragically on 22 September 2015. They include:\n\n22 September 2015\n\nThe day of the incident began with a disturbing discovery. Debby's roommate found James Anderson, a third roommate, dead from a gunshot wound in their shared apartment. Concerned for Debby's safety, the roommate contacted the police, fearing she might also be in danger.\n\nThe morning of 22 September\n\nPolice tracked Debby's mobile phone to an apartment rented by their daughter, where Mark was staying. When officers knocked on the door around 11:15 AM, they heard shots fired from inside. Mark shouted that he had Debby and demanded time to \"gather his thoughts,\" threatening her life if his demands were not met.\n\nThe police attempted to negotiate with Mark for several hours. However, communication ceased after a certain point, leading authorities to breach the door using explosives.\n\nDiscovery of bodies\n\nUpon entering, police found both Mark and Debby deceased from gunshot wounds. Mark had shot Debby twice before turning the gun on himself. The investigation revealed that Mark had also been involved in the earlier murder of James Anderson.\n\nImpact on the Paranormal Community\n\nGhost Adventures couple Mark and Debby Constantino pose for the camera. Photo: @GhostAdventures\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nThe paranormal community and Ghost Adventures fans were left in shock and mourning. The show's cast and crew expressed profound sadness and confusion over the incident, with Zak Bagans, the host, tweeting that it was a \"very tragic dark day.\"\n\nThe event sparked discussions about the emotional toll of dealing with the paranormal, possibly exacerbating underlying personal issues.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath included tributes from fans and peers, some of whom speculated on the influence of their paranormal activities on their personal lives, though these theories remain unsubstantiated.\n\nThere was a notable episode of Ghost Adventures where the crew attempted to contact Zak Bagan's friends who passed away, Mark and Debby, which was met with mixed reactions regarding the ethics of such an investigation.\n\nDespite their deaths, Debby and Mark left a legacy in the paranormal community through their contributions to EVP and the cautionary tale of their personal lives. Their story has since been a topic of discussion in forums and among paranormal enthusiasts, often as a lesson on the importance of mental health and the dangers of domestic violence.\n\nFAQs about Mark and Debby Constantino\n\nWhat happened to Debby Constantino from Ghost Adventures?

The new planet, with a mass six times that of Earth's, orbits a star similar to our Sun. It has been named HD 20794 d and confirmed by an international team of scientists. It was originally found two years ago by Dr Michael Cretignier from Oxford University's physics department and is located in the Eridanus constellation. Dr Cretignier explained: \"With its location in a habitable zone and relatively close proximity to Earth, this planet could play a pivotal role in future missions that will characterise the atmospheres of exoplanets to search for biosignatures indicating potential life.\" He first identified the potential exoplanet signal in 2022 while studying archive data recorded by the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) spectrograph at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Such data analyses light absorbed and emitted by objects.\n\nREAD MORE NASA breakthrough as experts discover there may be life on Uranus moons\n\nThe new planet has a mass six times that of Earth\n\nThe expert spotted periodic shifts in the spectrum of light emitted by the host star, which Oxford University said could have been caused by a nearby planet's gravitational pull. At the time of Dr Cretignier's initial discovery, it was unclear if the signal was caused by a planet, the star or if it was just a technical glitch. Members from the international team of scientists studied \"highly-precise\" measurements taken over 20 years by HARPS and the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO). The two instruments are among the most advanced in the world for measuring tiny variations in light. Detailed in a new study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, the discovery also relied on data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Dr Cretignier said scientists worked on the data for years, analysing and eliminating possible sources of contamination to pinpoint the planet's signal. The discovery was confirmed after the results from HARPS and ESPRESSO were combined.\n\nThe new planet was originally found two years ago (file image)\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "Earth's biggest hidden mountains revealed deep beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean\n\nScientists find mysterious \"islands\" beneath Earth with unpredictable seismic behavior\n\n\n\nUnusual seismic behaviour revealed Earth's deepest secrets\n\nAlso Read:\n\nScientists have discovered two enormous structures deep inside Earth whose sizes are forcing scientists to rethink the way they see the inside of their planet, at the boundary between Earth's core and the mantle, beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean, these \"islands\" described as continent-sized regions whose temperatures are thousands of degrees higher than the average temperature of the surroundings. According to new research from Utrecht University, these structures are not only gigantic but also old, with origins at least half a billion years ago. The discovery raises new questions about the geological history of the planet and the forces shaping its interior, offering fresh insights into Earth's dynamic evolution.The world's largest mountains have been found deep inside Earth, according to a landmark paper published in the journal Nature today. These giants are some 100 times higher than Mount Everest, rising 1,000 kilometers, while Everest's peak is about 8.8 kilometers above the sea. Researchers estimate that these mountains are at least half a billion years old, dating back to the Earth's formation, over four billion years ago.Scientists say the mountains are at least 500 million years old and probably date back to Earth's origin. Surrounding the mountains is tectonic debris that comes from subduction, in which one tectonic plate is sunk beneath another. Seismic shockwaves have led scientists to reveal these giant land masses hidden in Earth's core and map its interior. The lead researcher, Dr. Arwen Deuss, does not know the origin of these mountains; it is a matter of whether they are transient structures or an old age mountain. This new discovery shook the understanding that existed within geology and further revealed the dynamics into the history of the Earth's interior.LLSVPs Large Low Seismic Velocity Provinces Large blobs of unknown, mysterious material lurking deep beneath our Earth's surface lie at the core-mantle boundary beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean. Enormous \"islands,\" they are found surrounded by a \"graveyard\" of cold sunken tectonic plates descended through the mantle via subduction. Seismic waves are slowed down as they travel through Earth's interior because of its very high temperatures in these regions.In a new study, researchers Arwen Deuss and Sujania Talavera-Soza approached things differently. Instead of measuring just the slowdown of seismic waves, they measured the waves' damping, or how much energy the waves lose as they travel. Contrary to their expectations, they found that the LLSVPs caused minimal damping, making seismic waves unusually loud, while the surrounding cold tectonic plate graveyard dampened the waves more, offering new insights into Earth's deep interior.The LLSVPs have remained enigmatic with deep, puzzling features located deep in Earth. Located near the boundary between Earth's core and its mantle, LLSVPs are hotter than surrounding tectonic plates. Analyzing seismic waves did something surprising; their energy dissipation or loss due to friction with Earth was lower compared to what has been considered usual, thereby causing the sound emitted to be surprisingly louder than other seismic events.Differently, the cold tectonic plate graveyard exhibited tremendous damping where the waves could be described to be softer. This was contrary to previous assumptions set forth that the upper mantle would dampen the waves. The scientists believe that the LLSVPs are much older and include bigger grain minerals that take less energy absorbed, meaning that explains their unusual seismic response."

The firm\u2019s goal is to work with scientists early and help them commercialize their research more quickly by providing expertise and funding.\n\n\u201cDeerfield is in that missing middle: funding initiatives which cannot be conducted under NIH or NSF funding but are too early stage for angel or venture funding,\u201d says Samir Mayekar, associate vice president and managing director of UChicago's Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. \"That\u2019s the hardest money to get.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with Deerfield is the latest move by UChicago to step up its game in technology transfer, or commercializing research and creating startup companies. It was a key goal of former President Bob Zimmer, and the effort is picking up under his successor, Paul Alivisatos, a materials-science researcher who has founded several startups.\n\nUChicago launched a deep-technology incubator and created several venture capital funds to help faculty, staff and students launch new companies. The most recent is UCM Ventures, a $25 million fund focused on healthcare startups.\n\nUChicago also will have space for researchers and a life-sciences incubator in a new 14-story office and lab facility called Hyde Park Labs, which is expected welcome its first tenants soon.\n\nBill Slattery, a partner at Deerfield, praised the university for its \"spirit of entrepreneurship that doesn\u2019t abandon the principles of education, which is a tough line to walk. This is a moment in time for U of C to seize that.\"\n\nDeerfield Management and UChicago are calling their partnership Hyde Park Discovery. A committee made up of leadership from the university, the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and Deerfield\u2019s scientific team will evaluate projects.\n\n\"Drug discovery takes time and is expensive,\" Slattery says, adding that Deerfield has made roughly a dozen investments so far at UIC, Northwestern and UIUC."

            "article_content": "OpenAI announced on Tuesday a new version of ChatGPT tailored specifically for government use. ChatGPT Gov, as it is called, appears to be something akin to giving Malibu Stacy a new hat.\n\nThe major difference between this version and the commercial chatbot, according to CNBC, is that with ChatGPT Gov, public agencies can feed \u201cnon-public, sensitive information\u201d into OpenAI models hosted within their own Microsoft Azure commercial cloud, or Azure Government community cloud, and manage their own security and compliance requirements.\n\nThe new version of ChatGPT is not yet approved for government use on non-public data, but of course, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been aligning himself closely with Trump in hopes of accumulating influence, and the company\u2019s head of product Kevin Weil told reporters it hopes that could help grease the wheels of bureaucracy. \u201cI know President Trump is also looking at how we can potentially streamline that, because it\u2019s one way of getting more modern software tooling into the government and helping the government run more efficiently,\u201d Weil said. \u201cSo we\u2019re very excited about that.\u201d\n\nOpenAI has released other versions of ChatGPT, including one built for universities that essentially gives students higher message limits and controls for university IT administrators.\n\nOpenAI demonstrated ChatGPT Gov to reporters, and the applications are more of the same features we have come to expect:\n\nAaron Wilkowitz, a solutions engineer at OpenAI, showed reporters a demo of a day in the life of a new Trump administration employee, allowing the person to sign into ChatGPT Gov and create a five-week plan for some of their job duties, then analyze an uploaded photo of the same printed-out plan with notes and markings all over it. Wilkowitz also demonstrated how ChatGPT Gov could draft a memo to the legal and compliance department summarizing its own AI-generated job plan and then translate the memo into different languages.\n\nIn the first few days of his new term, Trump\u2019s administration has been accused of using AI to write a flurry of executive orders that have been described as sloppy and hard to understand.\n\nSecurity of non-public data has been a major concern surrounding the use of commercial chatbots in the workplace. Early on in the chatbot fervor of 2023, major corporations blocked their employees from accessing the likes of ChatGPT and Claude over fears the models would ingest proprietary corporate data. And Microsoft\u2019s own chatbot for enterprises, called Copilot 365, has received criticism for inadvertently oversharing sensitive data with employees not granted permission to see it.\n\nAnother concern with the use of AI in government is that it is prone to error and could display bias. It has already been shown repeatedly that AI systems have been used to tie people to crimes, leading to false arrests when law enforcement relies too much on the systems. Years ago, ProPublica published an investigation looking at how judges across the country were using AI to decide whether or not to grant bail to defendants. The system was less likely to suggest offering bail to people from poorer neighborhoods with higher crime rates, therefore biasing the system against them. But AI speaks with confidence and makes people complacent even though it is a glorified autocomplete; users are prone to accept what it says as fact.\n\nOpenAI \u201cacknowledges there are special considerations\u201d for government use of AI,\u201d and that users still must comply with its usage policies.\n\nAltman is trying his best to gain power and influence in Washington, stoking fears that China\u2019s artificial intelligence is a major threat to America and simultaneously offering the solution\u2014even though generative AI\u2019s true value remains up for debate. ChatGPT Gov seems another attempt to entrench his company as quickly as possible. President Trump says he is dedicated to beating China in the artificial intelligence race; he says jump, and Altman asks, \u201cHow high?\u201d"

To coincide with our Predictions event on thedrum.com, each day this week we are spotlighting agencies that we believe are primed to set the agenda in the months to come.\n\nIn part one, we examined why the likes of AMV BBDO, Hearts & Science and Code and Theory are among the ones to watch this year. Today, we introduce you to 10 more agencies \u2013 some already firmly established, others on the march \u2013 that are due recognition based on their achievements in 2024 and what they promise to deliver from here on out.\n\nWe will continue to reveal the featured agencies in a series of articles until the end of this week. They hail from all corners of the world and represent a diverse range of specialisms. But what they all have in common is that they have earned The Drum Recommends status on the strength of their recent performance.\n\nSo now, it\u2019s over to our next 10 Agencies to Watch to learn about the secrets of their success so far and what makes them believe 2025 will be their year.\n\nThe President\u2019s Award winner at The Drum Awards for Content 2024 will be eager to continue proving itself as a jewel in the IPG crown as its mega-merger with Omnicom takes shape.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nEmma Armstrong, CEO: For many reasons, I think we\u2019re going to see a continued focus on efficiency in 2025 \u2013 both on the client and agency side. We all know that, if left unchecked, this has the potential to lead to a race to the bottom and the continued erosion of the value and distinctiveness of agencies and our work. We need to shift the industry focus to effectiveness \u2013 that magical combination of insightful, creative ideas that drive real business results for our clients.\n\nSecondly, I think there will be a continued trend of the more successful agencies putting clear water between themselves and the rest of the industry by doubling down on innovation.\n\nOur industry is changing at lightning speed. Our clients \u2013 and the people at our agencies \u2013 are relying on us to keep pace or even outpace the speed of change.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nIn 2024, we brought in 12 new brands looking to make a big creative splash this year. We\u2019re excited to launch new campaigns for Pringles, Cheez-It, Listerine and more in the next few months, starting with Pringles Super Bowl work.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nSpotify \u2018Spreadbeats\u2019: To challenge media planners\u2019 assumptions that Spotify is just an audio platform and showcase our video offerings, we found a way to hack the media RFP process and shift the conversation.\n\nMichelob Ultra \u2018Lap of Legends\u2019: Michelob Ultra wanted to join the Formula 1 conversation, but instead of simply placing their logo on a car, we created \u2018Lap of Legends,\u2019 the world\u2019s first real versus virtual F1 race. Instead of pitching Lap of Legends to prospective media partners, TV and streaming networks actually pitched to host our show on their platforms and brands paid to be featured during the commercial breaks to bring in a $30m ROMI.\n\nFDA Center for Tobacco Products \u2018Toxic Taxidermy\u2019: We\u2019ve built a decade-long partnership with the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products with The Real Cost campaign to prevent teens from using tobacco. In our latest iteration, we warned teens about formaldehyde in their vapes through spokespeople that we knew would get teens to take notice \u2013 taxidermized animals who know the impact of formaldehyde all too well.\n\nBudweiser \u2018Old School Delivery\u2019: Understanding the value of earned impressions, we brought the iconic Budweiser Clydesdales and labrador back to the Super Bowl in epic fashion. The campaign became Budweiser\u2019s most viewed, shared and commented Super Bowl spot in their history and significantly increased purchase intent.\n\nThe purpose-driven agency, which has won acclaim for change campaigns such as its NHS drive placing cancer awareness prompts in unexpected places, is primed to deliver more work that inspires real action in 2025.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nConsumers are done with empty purpose statements. The era of selling through abstract ideals is over. We\u2019re seeing customers demanding authentic action, not rhetoric, so we\u2019re counseling clients to prove their commitment through tangible initiatives, not impressive manifestos. Real change, measurable impact and genuine social responsibility are now the benchmarks for consumer trust. Companies that understand this shift \u2013 those who demonstrate their values through concrete actions will successfully engage modern audiences.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWe\u2019ve got some exciting things planned as we continue to evolve our brand and campaign services that change behavior for the better \u2013 all of which we will share throughout the course of the year. We\u2019ve also just welcomed two exceptional creative talents in Dan McCormack and Luke Boggins into our fold with a proven pedigree working on award-winning international work for blue-chip clients, including McDonald\u2019s, Tesco, Virgin Holidays, Subway and Pfizer. We can\u2019t wait to unleash them and see what we are able to achieve together!\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe\u2019re proud of our innovative NHS \u2018Be Body Aware\u2019 campaign, which integrates health messaging into everyday items such as Morrisons\u2019 underwear labels and Tesco toilet rolls. By placing cancer awareness prompts in unexpected places, our campaign messaging is now in millions of products in our target audiences\u2019 homes, so we\u2019re really helping people take proactive health steps.\n\nWinning the creative account for \u2018This Girl Can\u2019 has been another milestone, adding to the stellar work our PR and partnerships teams have achieved with Sport England this year. As the campaign marks its 10th anniversary, we\u2019re busy with the next phase.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nDavid&Goliath\n\nFresh from celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Californian content and creative agency is readying itself for the next era of helping challenger brands flourish.\n\nDavid&Goliath\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nWith a name like David&Goliath, we welcome new challenges and trends and continue to look at them as opportunities. This year\u2019s turbulence surrounding social platforms will create opportunities for brands to stand out and stand up for their audiences and the world to see. We envision brands being recognized for what they don\u2019t do on platforms as much as, if not more so, than what they do. We\u2019re heading into 2025 by challenging every assumption of what works and why and looking at existing and new platforms to gain an even greater advantage for our brand partners.\n\nWhat\u2019s a trend forecast without a mention of AI? It is integral throughout our process, from strategy to creative to measurement. The speed to outcome frees up our people to focus more on finding opportunities and crafting brave new thinking and ideas.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nThis past year marked a milestone for David&Goliath as we celebrated our 25th anniversary \u2013 a quarter century of helping challenger people and brands face their biggest goliaths and rise to unthinkable heights.\n\nWe continued to live our Brave philosophy from the inside out as we kicked off the anniversary at Cannes by introducing our next Brave initiative with BraveU, a transformative program for young creators, empowering them to bravely own their truth. In addition, we continued to build on our Brave Camp initiative that helps inner city kids of Harlem travel outside their comfort zone and become the best versions of themselves.\n\nFounder and creative chairman David Angelo and long-time veterans Ben Purcell, chief creative officer, and CJ Stockton, chief of operations, expanded the executive leadership at David&Goliath. Amy Chiang was promoted to chief of integration. Michele Tebbe returned to the agency as chief of client services and business growth. And Brendan Robertson was hired for his insightful thinking as our chief strategy officer. Together, this group is working closely across all aspects of the business heading into 2025 and beyond.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe started 2024 helping Kia Save New Year\u2019s in Times Square. Then for the Super Bowl, we launched Kia\u2019s flagship vehicle, the EV9, with a heartfelt campaign that stood out in the sea of celebrities. Then we crashed the big game through social with our Jollibee partners and deep-fried football. And for Vizio, we brought to life a new platform and a few new characters that encouraged the world to \u2018Watch Us.\u2019 In addition, we continued to lead culture as we enlisted the help of hype man Flavor Flav to play the role of the Flavor Genie, who helps America discover the new flavors of Smartfood popcorn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe small but mighty Agency of the Year (under 10 staff) at The Drum Awards for Agency Business has big ambitions for the year ahead.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nGulliver Moore, managing director and founder: As they bend the knee to a new western economic and cultural order, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon will continue dominating, accounting for over 70% of global ad spend growth. Amazon\u2019s retail media expansion highlights the shift towards direct-to-consumer strategies, leveraging first-party data to target buyers more effectively. For marketers, standing out in this data-driven space will require fresh creativity to reach audiences.\n\nAs cookies continue to phase out due to privacy concerns, first-party data is taking center stage. Clean rooms and authenticated targeting are becoming more standard, allowing brands to deliver personalized campaigns while maintaining consumer trust. The challenge for agencies lies in integrating complex data strategies into compelling creative work.\n\nWith nearly 20% growth projected, Connected TV (CTV) platforms like Netflix and YouTube are transforming video advertising. CTV allows for richer storytelling and better targeting than traditional TV, offering brands a new space to captivate audiences with longer-form narratives. Linear TV spend also remains strong, particularly in the UK compared with other markets. We saw this trend reflected in our own work at Sunday Treat, with many TVCs on our slate last year for brands like KLM and Leonardo Hotels airing across the UK and Ireland.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nMoore: We were thrilled to win Agency of the Year last year, which really was our first industry recognition and has given us the confidence to develop more of an awards strategy this year.\n\nWe\u2019ve recently hired a fantastic new business development manager which is part of a complete refresh of our already very successful new biz strategy \u2013 and in anticipation of this investment, we\u2019re bringing in new roles to handle the additional work.\n\nFinally, we\u2019re doubling down on our commitment to \u2018Find the Fun\u2019 in all the projects we work on; it has been an incredibly successful niche for us and so rewarding for the team to be working on fun projects. I categorise all of our projects and last year 67% were in the \u201cfun/ creative\u201d category which is quite simply incredible compared to the start of Sunday Treat in 2021.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nMoore: \u2018Yes It Daz\u2019 was the slogan for the new Daz campaign that we worked on with the influencer Troy Hawke. It was a big brand partnership for him and a big campaign for Daz, which has recently been acquired by a new company. The campaign was a huge success and it was so fun to take the whole team out to Westfield shopping center to see our work on the big screens along with the TV commercials on ITVX.\n\nWe onboarded Canon as a new client, completing many new projects for it, such as the flagship C400 launch video featuring Sarah Thomas Moffatt the Dual Fisheye lens video which we conceptualized with Sam Baumel, the US-based VR filmmaker we brought over from New York.\n\nVirtual Production: we had many VP projects in 2024, but the highlight for me was a currently unreleased project for KLM which saw a huge cast of characters travel to Hong Kong, Rio and Capetown all from our studio in Slough.\n\nOur first Sunday Treat \u2018Original since Sliced Bread\u2019 was shot in 2024, featuring the incredible Alice Etches. It\u2019s about a woman who goes on a date with a half-man/half-goat. Our commitment to short-form comedy is one of the founding principles at Sunday Treat and I\u2019m excited to run the festival circuit with this one and start planning our follow-up this year.\n\nThe Grand Prix winner at The Drum Awards for PR is in a rich vein of form creatively and is on a mission to ensure PR takes its rightful place in the marketing mix.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nKat Arnull, chief strategy officer: PR will continue to shift toward being a marketing mindset over a channel. 2025 will be the year where we see the shift from PR being seen as a marketing channel \u2013 seen as a choice between or amplifier of advertising \u2013 toward PR being seen as a marketing mindset that ensures effectiveness. The breakthrough campaigns will all be devised by using an earned first approach designed to reach audiences on their terms. In a year where we saw a president chosen by a podcast, it\u2019s going to be even more important that we are thinking about how we connect with audiences on multiple levels and challenge the laws that have gone before.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nArnull: Our clients want smart, channel-agnostic thinking, audience-led media strategy and great earned thinking, so over the last year and into next year, we are sharpening our integrated media planning and capabilities by investing in new hires \u2013 such as ex-LadBible\u2019s Gemma Combellack as consumer EVP and Gareth Davies as integrated media EVP, social director Paige Hiley, as well as building out our influencer team.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nArnull: Our \u2018Misheard Version\u2019 work with Specsavers won seven Cannes Lions in 2024, including two Grand Prix with the first ever PR Lion Grand Prix won by a PR agency\u2019s creative idea, truly showing the power of an earned-first idea.\n\nAsics \u2018Desk Break\u2019: We recruited the world\u2019s scariest boss, Brian Cox, to deliver a rousing public service announcement to desk workers, calling on them to reject wellness perks like \u2018Wellness Wednesdays\u2019 and to \u2018f**k the fruit\u2019 to instead take a 15-minute #DeskBreak to move for your mind. Supported by research and The Desk Break experiment by Dr Brendon Stubbs that proved the benefits of a 15-minute break, the campaign took the world by storm, reaching over 2.7 billion with the director general of the World Health Organisation organically sharing our work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving expanded its digital expertise with the acquisition of Don\u2019t be Shy last autumn, the fast-growing B2B specialist continues to thrive with brands that have a complex route to market or a technical product to sell.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nThere is growing recognition in the benefits of working with an agency that exemplifies a truly positive culture. Our managing director, Alexander Swann, spoke on this topic at B2B World Fest recently and the importance of looking beyond talent, strategy, creativity and effectiveness, instead focusing on what makes a positive agency culture and invest in it. The result is the agency will yield talented people, who take pride in doing a great job for their clients. Positive culture is one of the single biggest force multipliers to campaign success. Agencies not getting this right has sunk more campaigns \u2013 and client budgets \u2013 than we care to mention. If those working on an account aren\u2019t giving their all, then you\u2019re likely to get mediocrity (or worse) back in return. So why would clients not make agency culture a big part of your selection process?\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWe\u2019ve now fully integrated our acquisition of Manchester-based Don\u2019t be Shy. In the next year, we\u2019ll crack on as an expanded agency with impressive digital skills that perfectly complement our strategy, PR and creative specialisms. People from both offices are working on some major campaigns with big B2B names in the tech, construction and telecom industries \u2013 so you\u2019ll be hearing a lot more from us in the coming months.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe won numerous awards in 2024, spanning all parts of the agency, including PR, creative, strategy and digital. From a brand perspective, it was extremely satisfying to develop a product identity and creative campaign for Polypipe Building Services that led to tens of millions in sales for it. On the demand side, campaigns for KBR, a global project engaging the world\u2019s biggest energy companies, and for Finning, the world\u2019s largest Caterpillar\u00e2 dealer, together generated over \u00a330m in qualified leads. We\u2019ve also supported Michelin on a global basis as it repositioned its B2B offering and continued projects with TalkTalk Business and Marks & Spencer.\n\nWith its first acquisition on the horizon, the winner of Agency of the Year (11-49 staff) at The Drum Awards for Agency Business is gearing itself up for further growth at home in the UK and beyond.\n\nManifest\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nAlex Myers, chief executive officer and founder: AI will go from crappy PR stunts to integral operational catalyst, with agencies super-charging teams with their own bespoke and customized systems and protocols. The era of purpose is well and truly over, but we\u2019ll see positive impact brands thrive by delivering enhanced experiences, not just better practices, ushering in an era of \u2018progress-driven marketing.\u2019\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nMyers: We\u2019ll be kicking off 2025 by completing our first acquisition (coming soon\u2026) Our team in Australia is set to double in size by the end of 2025, with some big wins about to be announced imminently. We are looking to expand our proprietary systems into software products for agency and in-house teams, including our creator management platform, Roger, and our omnichannel reporting framework, The Loop.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nMyers: Our recent campaign with Rewearing is Caring saw pioneering cleaning brand Ecover partnering with model and sustainability activist Lily Cole to urge Brits to stop over-washing and start rewearing. Hundreds of consumers swarmed to attend the pre-loved pop-up store and panel, hosted in partnership with Charity Super.Mkt, ready to snap up a designer bargain and learn about how they can be more sustainable.\n\nStateside, we drove a nationwide plant-based pizza trial inspired by the master manipulators with Daiya\u2019s Pizza Pyramid Scheme. Over 12,000 people got their first taste of plant-based pizza through peer-to-peer recommendations, discovering a new world of dairy-free deliciousness.\n\nWe rebranded the iconic Michigan Theater Foundation to Marquee Arts, a contemporary new look and proposition that modernized the much-loved institution while maintaining its unique heritage and setting it up for its next exciting chapter as a shining light for the Arts.\n\nSuggested newsletters for you Daily Briefing Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

The Drum Insider Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum.\n\nAfter a dominant display at The Drum Awards for B2B, the women-led US agency is investing in both AI and talent to continue its momentum.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nDoug Kamp, chief creative officer: All the buzz in the last year has been about the application of AI. And while many have seen demonstrative benefits in digital, media, personalization,and administrative efficiency, creative application has been incredibly inconsistent. As a tool to coalesce thinking and ideation, it\u2019s been amazing. As a tool to execute final production, it\u2019s been incredibly inconsistent and still a bit austere.\n\nWhich leads me to one a few top trends: authenticity. Brand affection is a key tenet of Mower strategy and creative \u2013 along with relevance and trust. Whether a remnant of the recent election cycle, or a result of the constant bombardment of digital and traditional media, authenticity, driven by empathy, is driving longer-term brand connections.\n\nVisual creative continues to drive increased engagement and growth. It\u2019s no surprise that video and social content continues to provoke customers. 2025 will see this trend ascend. Against the cacophony of political noise and talking heads, visual entertainment, storytelling, and simplicity is driving stickier\u2014and more deeply emotional-- connections (re: Pavio\u2019s \u2018Picture-Superiority Effect\u2019). This is especially true for target audiences not currently in the market to buy.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nAs a women-led organization, we\u2019re excited to secure our WBENC certification in 2025 to support clients with diverse procurement goals. We\u2019re investing in AI to enhance operations and empower faster, smarter work in strategy, creative and media. Our talent development initiatives include mentorship programs, emerging leaders training, a coach-in-residence for emotional intelligence and Disc. We\u2019re advancing analytics with a focus on attribution challenges and strengthening industry expertise through our B2B, financial services, travel & tourism, energy & sustainability and healthcare specialties. Lastly, we\u2019re deepening ties with our global networks like IPREX and TheNetworkOne to drive growth and innovation.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nMower has had an extraordinary run of exceptional work, culminating in 10 The Drum B2B Awards, plus B2B Marketing and ANA B2B Agency of the Year. And Best B2B Campaign from the Indie Awards. The biggest contributor to this recognition has been our breakthrough work for Carhartt. While consumers love the brand, Carhartt\u2019s business offering, which focused on uniforms, were relatively unknown. We launched Carhartt\u2019s first B2B campaign, \u2018More Than a Uniform,\u2019 positioning Carhartt as not only the best workwear but also a competitive business advantage. This resulted in an incredible +105% increase in revenue and 150% increase in sales. Oh, and our client was named \u2018Marketer of the Year.\u2019\n\nA second standout has been our work for energy provider FirstEnergy. Here, we were asked to educate drone pilots on the dangers of flying in and around power lines. Mower\u2019s internal research team discovered that these \u2018Drone Daredevils\u2019 are competitive thrill seekers who push limits and regulations. And likely wouldn\u2019t respond to straightforward education messages. The solution? Give them what they crave \u2013 a gamified experience fueled by adrenaline but driven by safety education, FirstEnergy\u2018s \u2018Drone Safety Zone Racing Game.\u2019 In just one year, the campaign flew far past our goals, with nearly 300,000 gameplays that included safety education, proving safety scores big when you know how to play their game.\n\nFresh off its strongest year, the punchy public relations agency enters its 10th year with its ambition to stand apart from \u201cboring PR\u201d as strong as ever.\n\nRomans\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nJoe Mackay-Sinclair, founder and chief executive officer: A succession of old network guys talking about return to work. Followed by a succession of old network guys talking about the death of purpose, ESG and all the other stuff they don\u2019t like. Hopefully swiftly followed by a spate of exciting new startups led by disgruntled ex-old-network employees.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nMackay-Sinclair: The Romans invested in new PR hotshop, Earnies, last year and it is absolutely flying. This year, we\u2019d be quite keen to invest in someone else\u2019s rage-quit startup. So, if you\u2019ve just been told to return to work, why not get in touch? Internationally, The Romans\u2019 offices in London, Amsterdam, Dubai and Brooklyn are all knitting together really nicely and in 30%+ growth. It feels like the next expansion will be in Berlin. Or Riyadh. Or Singapore. Watch this space.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nMackay-Sinclair: When it comes to work, it\u2019s been a vintage year. Our Lidl Croissant Bag became the first carb to conquer London Fashion Week. We worked with Finnish metalheads Lordi to record Made Of Metal, a wild new track to launch OnePlus\u2019s new metal phone. We helped serial Wimbledon runner-up Andy Roddick win his first Wimbledon title by taking over Wimbledon, North Dakota (population: 144) and mowing the town\u2019s first tennis court. We got Nationwide into the fried chicken shop game to launch its new student account with NationFried. And we melted LinkedIn for hot takes when our Freeway truck hit the road in December as some people felt it bore a passing resemblance to another famous Christmas campaign.\n\nEmbracing disruption across our digital world, the social agency is determined to make 2025 the year creators and the C-suite collide.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nNeil Waller, group co-founder and co-chief executive officer: 2025 will be the year that the creator economy evolves from a marketing footnote to a boardroom priority. As creators move from the fringes of culture to the mainstream, C-suite executives are developing a deeper awareness of creators and their full potential. This year, we\u2019ll see that the creator economy will be cemented as a critical topic in business strategy and cultural conversations.\n\nThe creator economy in 2025 will mark a significant evolution, defined by increased professionalism, strategic planning and technological innovation.\n\nGenerative AI will also play a transformative role, with creators adopting tools for tasks such as editing, animation, captions and workflow optimization. Platforms and startups alike are developing solutions to enhance efficiency and unlock new creative possibilities. Compared with traditional media, creators are agile, non-unionized and aggregate younger. Therefore, their adoption of an AI toolset is going to be quicker. As a result, it is going to be transformative for the creator economy.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWaller: At Whalar, 2025 is our year of impact and disruption, driven by the unstoppable momentum of the creator revolution. From the Whalar Group level, we are thrilled about launching The Lighthouse, a first-of-its-kind Creator campus in Venice in February. Game-changing partnerships with Tribeca, iHeartMedia and LinkedIn continue to redefine possibilities, while campaigns with clients such as Anthropic, NFL, Oatly and eBay bring new opportunities to the forefront. We\u2019re also navigating emerging platforms and adapting to potential TikTok shifts. From pitching \u2018The Whalar Way\u2019 to the UK government to activating at Coachella and the Super Bowl, 2025 is all about bold moves and shaping the future of the creator economy.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWaller: Whalar\u2019s 2024 highlights are a testament to the power of creativity and cultural resonance. Standout campaigns include the NFL Creator of the Week initiative, which celebrates dynamic and engaging content and Twinings partnering with creators to reveal a \u201cnew way to tea.\u201d Mozilla Firefox captivated Gen Z audiences with authentic conversations about data privacy, while J2O \u2018Posh Perspectives\u2019 brought a touch of storytelling sophistication to beverage marketing. Our long-term partnership with Diageo creator campaigns elevated global spirits brands to new heights. Oatly\u2019s bold Moofia takedown sparked industry buzz and Waymo\u2019s collaboration with creators, especially Sooraj\u2019s video, redefined how tech stories are told. Each project demonstrates Whalar\u2019s ability to unlock the full potential of creativity through creators while driving cultural impact."

The new planet, with a mass six times that of Earth's, orbits a star similar to our Sun. It has been named HD 20794 d and confirmed by an international team of scientists. It was originally found two years ago by Dr Michael Cretignier from Oxford University's physics department and is located in the Eridanus constellation. Dr Cretignier explained: \"With its location in a habitable zone and relatively close proximity to Earth, this planet could play a pivotal role in future missions that will characterise the atmospheres of exoplanets to search for biosignatures indicating potential life.\" He first identified the potential exoplanet signal in 2022 while studying archive data recorded by the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) spectrograph at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Such data analyses light absorbed and emitted by objects.\n\nREAD MORE NASA breakthrough as experts discover there may be life on Uranus moons\n\nThe new planet has a mass six times that of Earth\n\nThe expert spotted periodic shifts in the spectrum of light emitted by the host star, which Oxford University said could have been caused by a nearby planet's gravitational pull. At the time of Dr Cretignier's initial discovery, it was unclear if the signal was caused by a planet, the star or if it was just a technical glitch. Members from the international team of scientists studied \"highly-precise\" measurements taken over 20 years by HARPS and the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO). The two instruments are among the most advanced in the world for measuring tiny variations in light. Detailed in a new study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, the discovery also relied on data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Dr Cretignier said scientists worked on the data for years, analysing and eliminating possible sources of contamination to pinpoint the planet's signal. The discovery was confirmed after the results from HARPS and ESPRESSO were combined.\n\nThe new planet was originally found two years ago (file image)\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "Though immensely powerful, volcanoes are not always spewing hot lava around. Many are considered dormant or even extinct and have not shown their strength for hundreds of thousands of years in some cases. However, a team of scientists recently found magma chambers lurking beneath six volcanoes in the Cascade Range. The findings published January 23 in the journal Nature Geoscience are challenging the idea of what separates an active volcano from a dormant one.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday. Email address Sign up Thank you! By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nActive vs. dormant volcanoes\n\nObviously, visible lava spewing from a volcano\u2019s caldera, like Hawai\u2019i\u2019s Mount K\u012blauea or Grimsv\u00f6tn in Iceland, indicates that a volcano is active. However, not all active volcanoes are erupting. They have the potential to erupt in the future with young and fresh magma chambers.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), a dormant volcano is one that is not erupting now. However, they could still erupt in the future. Some volcanologists will use the qualifier \u201clong-dormant system\u201d to refer to a volcano that has not erupted in thousands of years. A \u201crecently active system\u201d might have erupted a few years or decades or centuries ago. What makes it dormant versus \u201cpotentially active\u201d is that its large magma bodies have typically been expelled during eruptions and have dissipated over time. Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania\u2013which last erupted about 360,000 years ago and Japan\u2019s Mount Fuji\u2013317 years ago\u2013are both currently considered to be dormant volcanoes.\n\nHowever, new research is challenging these definitions.\n\nThe magma beneath\n\nIn the new study, a team from Cornell University and the USGS studied six volcanoes of various size and dormancy status within the Cascade Range in the northwestern United States\u2014Lassen Peak, Crater Lake, the Newberry Volcano, Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Rainier. Seismic waves identified persistent and large magma chambers in all of the volcanoes\u2013even the dormant ones. According to the team, these results were surprising since some of the volcanoes\u2013including the Crater Lake volcano in Oregon\u2013have not been active for thousands of years.\n\n\u201cRegardless of eruption frequency, we see large magma bodies beneath many volcanoes,\u201d Guanning Pang, a study co-author and Cornell University postdoctoral researcher, said in a statement. \u201cIt appears that these magma bodies exist beneath volcanoes over their whole lifetime, not just during an active state.\u201d\n\nObserving that more volcanoes have sustained magma bodies is an important factor for researchers that monitor and predict future volcanic activity. As part of the National Volcano Early Warning System, the USGS has spent time expanding and upgrading volcanic monitoring networks within the Cascade Range and elsewhere. The goal is to detect the signs and signals of an impending eruption as early as possible to give people ample warning.\n\n[ Related: Extinct volcanoes could hold rare earth elements. ]\n\n\u201cWe used to think that if we found a large amount of magma, that meant increased likelihood of eruption,\u201d Pang said, \u201cbut now we are shifting perception that this is the baseline situation.\u201d\n\nThese results suggest eruptions do not always completely drain a magma chamber. Instead, it will release some of the excess volume and pressure. The magma chamber can then be slowly expanded and refilled over time as the crust melts gradually.\n\n\u201cIf we had a better general understanding of where magma was, we could do a much better job of targeting and optimizing monitoring,\u201d study co-author and Cornell geophysicist Wiliam Abers said in a statement. Abers also noted that there are a, \u201cgreat many volcanoes that are sparsely monitored or have not been subject to intensive study.\u201d\n\nA portable method\n\nAdditionally, the team found that they could use fewer tools to recover this important data. They used a very small network of seismometers situated around each volcano in the study and leveraged some of the recent upgrades made to seismic broadband stations near Cascade Range volcanoes. They then applied a technique that uses scattered wavefields from distant earthquakes, to create detailed subsurface images.\n\n\u201cPreviously, imaging methods required deploying tens to hundreds of seismometers around a volcano, making for a challenging undertaking,\u201d Abers said.\n\nPlans to expand the magma monitoring system to see if the same discovery in the Cascades can be applied elsewhere are already in the works. One of those locations is Alaska, home to over 130 volcanoes, 90 of which have been active within the last 10,000 years.\n\n\u201cOur method is very portable and can be used at many if not most other volcanoes around the world, with just a small number of modern seismographic stations,\u201d Abers said. \u201cWe think it can help systemize volcano studies, and provide a key piece of global frameworks for volcanic hazard assessment.\u201d"

Organizations reported that resource constraints, heavy administrative overhead, and lack of automation in their ITSM programs hold them back from improved service execution. (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nTeamDynamix sponsored an IDC study and white paper to look deeper at how IT leaders are addressing ITSM modernization efforts. Key findings highlight that 63% of participants use some form of AI-enabled automation, and 54% have an AI-enabled technician assistant. Currently, 39% of respondents report using GenAI-enabled knowledge management. Additional organizations are prioritizing these implementations over the next 12\u201318 months as part of a broader ITSM modernization initiative. ITSM modernization is accelerating with the adoption of automation and AI to reduce the time IT teams are spending on manual, mundane tasks to instead focus on improved user experiences.\n\nTeamDynamix Outlook: Key Trends for ITSM in 2025 \u2013 The Rise of No-Code Automation and AI is Driving Agility and Easing IT Teams\u2019 Burden Amid Increasing Demands\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio, January 28, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--IT leaders are rapidly adopting automation and AI to fuel IT Service Management (ITSM) modernization initiatives. As demands for IT resources continue to rise, IT leaders are challenged to increase operational efficiency while delivering superior user experiences.

This combination is revolutionizing the IT service desk by eliminating manual bottlenecks, empowering teams to work faster, delivering better insights and enabling seamless alignment with broader business goals.\"\n\n\"The unique ability of the platform to leverage AI with the underlying integration hub and automation layer is fueling rapid adoption,\" adds Graf. \"We are seeing the most interesting, unique use cases emerge \u2013 there\u2019s the obvious use for information retrieval or efficient content generation, but we can take you further when you pair conversational AI with automation.\"\n\nKey use cases for ITSM automation with AI include on/offboarding, equipment replacement, PTO balance inquiries, requisition requests and more.\n\nITSM Modernization Trends to Watch in 2025\n\nTo further explore these emerging trends, TeamDynamix sponsored an IDC White Paper, Bridging the Maturity Gap to Modernize IT Service Management*, that looked at the top challenges and priorities facing IT leaders today.\n\nKey Findings:\n\nAutomation Reduces Time Spent on Routine Tasks - The study reveals that 63% of IT leaders spend between 1\u20134 hours weekly on manual tasks like equipment replacement, system audits/compliance checks, onboarding and software provisioning, with 20% reporting 4+ hours per week. Automating these processes could optimize the service desk to unlock significant productivity gains and free IT teams to focus on innovation.\n\nEnterprise-Wide Integration Is Falling Short - While 80% of organizations have some basic ITSM integrations, fewer than 35% report their systems as fully operational across the ecosystem \u2013 hindering true digital transformation. Equally limiting is the deployment of Enterprise Service Management (ESM). Only 35% of respondents have extended ITSM workflows for ESM to departments beyond IT including HR, finance and facilities, highlighting a critical need for tools that enable true ESM.\n\nAI Is Transforming Service Management - Nearly 63% of organizations are exploring AI-enabled automation to streamline ticket management, with 32% fully implementing AI for case resolution and 39% utilizing AI for knowledge-based content creation. AI drives efficiencies across service management by enabling faster resolutions, automating ticket handling, improving employee self-service, enabling advanced chat interactions and expediting access to information.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Microsoft is rolling out a new tool dubbed \u201cscareware blocker,\u201d which uses machine learning and computer vision to identify a very pervasive type of online scam.\n\n\u201cScareware\u201d has blighted the web almost since its inception, often in the form of fake antivirus software that claims to have detected a nonexistent threat on a user\u2019s machine. They then either trick the user into installing a malicious program or paying for software they don\u2019t need.\n\nJust last year, two tech support firms were forced to pay $26 million as part of a settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which had accused the companies of deceptive marketing practices, including using fake Windows pop-ups, to scam consumers.\n\n\u201cThese companies used scare tactics and lies about threats to consumers\u2019 personal computers to bilk consumers, particularly older consumers, out of tens of millions of dollars,\u201d Samuel Levine, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement at the time.\n\nMicrosoft already offers some tools to block scammy websites that have been detected and reported elsewhere, but the new feature is all about blocking previously unknown scam tools when they attempt to open a full-screen page.\n\nMicrosoft first teased the blocker at its Ignite conference in November, but now it\u2019s calling on users to help test the feature through a preview program in its Edge browser.\n\nSetting up\n\nScareware blocker requires the user to activate the feature through the \u201cPrivacy, search, and services\u201d setting in Edge.\n\nActivating scareware blocker. Image Credits:Microsoft\n\nThis adds an additional level of security to what exists within the likes of Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, which already looks for suspicious activity on web pages. Scareware blocker specifically intervenes if a scam tool attempts to open a full-screen page, a tactic that can make it more difficult both to identify a scam and circumvent it \u2014 for example, a user might not know to hit the \u201cEsc\u201d key to exit full-screen mode.\n\nMicrosoft said it used thousands of real-world sample scams to train the machine learning model that underpins scareware blocker. It then uses computer vision to compare these samples with new scams it encounters in real time.\n\nIf the tool suspects potential scareware, it will exit full-screen mode, stop any audio playback (e.g., an alarm or voice) that might accompany the scam, and give the user the option to continue to the page or close it completely.\n\nScareware blocker in action. Image Credits:Microsoft\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe fact that Microsoft is using computer vision to analyze users\u2019 screens might raise concerns. There are some parallels with Microsoft\u2019s controversial AI-powered Recall feature, which takes snapshots of users\u2019 screens to create a searchable history of everything they\u2019ve done on the computer.\n\nHowever, with scareware blocker, Microsoft maintains that the machine learning model runs locally on the user\u2019s machine, and nothing is saved or sent to the cloud.\n\nTo improve the model and broader Defender SmartScreen software, Microsoft is also soliciting feedback from early adopters, presenting them an option to share a screenshot of the scam with Microsoft. Users can also report scenarios where scareware blocker makes a mistake and blocks a genuine website."

A report from the National Council for Scientific Research in Lebanon said a preliminary estimate of damages showed that nearly 3,000 buildings in the Dahiya area south of the city had been destroyed, severely damaged or extensively damaged."

            "article_content": "By Oliver Griffin, Luis Jaime Acosta and Nandita Bose\n\nBOGOTA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Colombia's President Gustavo Petro averted an economic disaster at the 11th hour after diplomats from his government and the U.S. reached a deal on deportation flights, but the Colombian business community on Monday called for cooler heads to prevail as Colombians bemoaned canceled U.S. visa appointments.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump had threatened tariffs and sanctions to punish Colombia for refusing to accept military flights carrying deportees, part of his sweeping immigration crackdown.\n\nBut in a statement late on Sunday, the White House said Colombia had agreed to accept the migrants after all and Washington would not impose the penalties. Colombia's Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo said separately the country's presidential plane was ready to carry deportees.\n\nColombia's ambassador to the U.S., Daniel Garcia-Pena, a long-time diplomat and former peace commissioner, was key to the late-night resolution of the dispute, a Colombian foreign office source said, after \"very tense\" discussions.\n\nGarcia-Pena sought to paint the late-night reversal as a victory for Colombia.\n\n\"There was a win-win here. The United States withdrew the threat of tariffs and Colombia was able to get the United States to accept that the treatment given to our citizens should be dignified,\" Garcia-Pena told local television channel Caracol.\n\nAsked if Trump had used Petro as an example to other countries, a White House source with knowledge of the matter said \"absolutely. Yes. Countries have an obligation to accept repatriation flights.\"\n\n\"The United States is simply sending back the criminals that Colombia sent to the United States,\" the source added.\n\nPetro's condemnation of the use of military planes, saying deportees were being treated like criminals and that his administration is \"the opposite of the Nazis\", seemed to rile Trump more than similar spats with Mexico and Brazil.\n\nThe showdown between Petro and Trump, who has been in office a week, played out through verbose posts on social media, with Petro on X and Trump on the Truth Social platform.\n\nThe measures announced by Trump, including a 25% tariff on all Colombian goods that was set to rise to 50% in a week and emergency treasury, banking and financial sanctions, would have had an \"immense impact\" on the Colombian economy, said Bruce Mac Master, president of business association ANDI.\n\n\"It was very worrying how the president (Petro) approached the problem because he was not conscious about all the consequences that it would have for the country,\" Mac Master told Reuters.\n\n\"It's as if Colombia had raised its hand and said 'I want to be part of the fight, please include me.' Well, they included us and we learned how we could potentially lose a lot,\" Mac Master said, adding that leaders in Brazil and Mexico had handled the issue better.\n\nThe Colombian foreign ministry said later on Monday that an air force plane was departing for San Diego, California, to bring home 110 Colombian deportees. A second similar flight would depart in the coming days, it added.\n\nVISA FRUSTRATION\n\nThe U.S. is Colombia's largest trading partner, largely due to a 2006 free trade agreement, with $33.8 billion worth of two-way trade in 2023 and a $1.6 billion U.S. trade surplus, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nThe U.S. accounted for a little over 29% of Colombia's exports in the first 11 months of 2024, according to Colombia's statistics agency.\n\nBillions of dollars of exports of Colombian oil, coal and coffee make their way north, as do around $1 billion in flowers, especially before next month's Valentine's Day event.\n\nColombia's already weak currency was down in early trading on Monday. Economic growth was a tepid 2% in the third quarter.\n\nThe cancellation of visa appointments at the U.S. embassy in Bogota frustrated many people, who told Reuters they had received emails saying appointments would be rescheduled.\n\nThe rigorous visa process for Colombians to go to the U.S., including as tourists, can take years and comes at great expense for those who must travel to the capital for several embassy appointments.\n\n\"We hope the president (Petro) will fix this,\" said Diosa Camacho, who traveled from the eastern city of Bucaramanga. Camacho said she had been engaged in the visa process for more than a year.\n\nValentina Forero said her family has been in the process for two years and though she wants deportees to be treated with respect, she wished the spat had been handled differently.\n\n\"They should have discussed it between the two governments and not included the people,\" she said. \"It wasn't diplomatic.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Petro's office or Colombia's foreign ministry.\n\n(Reporting by Oliver Griffin, Luis Jaime Acosta, Camilo Cohecha and Javier Andres Rojas in Bogota and Nandita Bose in Washington; additional reporting by Julia Symmes Cobb in BogotaWriting by Julia Symmes Cobb; editing by Paul Simao and David Gregorio)"

            "article_content": "The new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 graphics cards reportedly won\u2019t be available for the $999 MSRP, and it\u2019s apparently all down to low profit margins for third-party card manufacturers. That\u2019s according to comments made on social media by hardware leakers, who suggest this particular Nvidia GPU is priced too low compared to the cost of manufacturing a card, with third-party graphics card makers struggling to make it work at the suggested price.\n\nNvidia is looking to continue to dominate the best graphics card market with its new GPUs, with recent leaked RTX 5080 benchmarks placing it ahead of the RTX 4080 Super. However, a troubled storm of RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 stock shortages, along with very high demand, could make these cards particularly hard to obtain for some time, especially at the prices that Nvidia is setting itself.\n\nIn a recent post on the Chiphell industry forum, leaker Wjm47196 shared some thoughts about the RTX 5080 price. Suggesting that the basic FE edition is already \u201c100% out of stock\u201d for gamers, Wjm47196 went on to say that the cause is because Nvidia has left third-party board partners with a very low gross profit margin after building the boards at the $999 MSRP price.\n\nWjm47196 speculates that the cost of the more expensive GDDR7 memory chips is being passed to the third-party card manufacturers, and that the issue of profitability will affect most of the RTX 5000 series. These comments were supported by another renowned hardware leaker, harukaze5719, who suggested in a post on X that gamers \u201cshouldn\u2019t expect [the RTX] 5080 will be sold at MSRP.\u201d\n\nAn earlier RTX 5080 price leak, showing the cost for a range of Gigabyte cards from a Finnish retailer, suggested that the majority of them were priced above Nvidia\u2019s $999 MSRP, with only one basic model card offered at that price. If Wjm47196\u2019s comments are true, however, board manufacturers such as Gigabyte don\u2019t have a huge incentive to manufacture the cheaper cards, due to the low profit margins, so we\u2019d expect any stock of RTX 5080 cards at MSRP to sell very quickly indeed.\n\nThat\u2019s before considering the significantly high demand that we expect to see for both cards when we reach the RTX 5090 release date. With campers already lining up outside brick-and-mortar stores to buy one of these cards, you might need to be quick off the mark if you\u2019re planning to pick up one of these new cards yourself.\n\nWe can help you out here, however. Make sure to keep checking our where to buy 5080 guide for the latest available stock levels each day for this new graphics card."

            "article_content": "Originally published by Illumio.\n\nWritten by Christer Swartz, Solutions Marketing Director, Illumio.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Gartner, \u201cBy 2026, 60% of enterprises working toward zero trust architecture will use more than one deployment form of microsegmentation, which is up from less than 5% in 2023.\u201d\n\nMicrosegmentation is foundational to zero trust. You can\u2019t achieve zero trust without it.\n\nIn fact, John Kindervag, the creator of Zero Trust, addressed the connection between zero trust and segmentation in the second report ever written on the topic, Build Security Into Your Network\u2019s DNA: The Zero Trust Network Architecture. In the report, he said, \u201cNew ways of segmenting networks must be created because all future networks need to be segmented by default.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re building a zero trust architecture, microsegmentation should be a crucial part of your plan. Here are the 10 things you can expect to do when starting out with microsegmentation.\u200d\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Get visibility into all workload traffic across every environment\n\nThe first \u2014 and one of the most important \u2014 steps of building microsegmentation is being able to know what\u2019s going on across all segments in your network. How do you see all traffic between all workloads across your cloud, endpoint, and data center environments? It\u2019s crucial to be able to achieve this level of visibility at any scale without an overly complex workflow.\n\nYou can try to use different visibility tools for different segments across your network. But using multiple tools will create a fragmented view. This can make it challenging to understand behavior across all segments everywhere.\n\nInstead, find a solution that can discover traffic across all segments and display it in one view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200d2. Understand how apps are communicating\n\nMost people agree that Zero Trust is a good idea, but how can you understand what traffic is required before deciding what to protect? It\u2019s not always easy to see what apps are running across your network and what ports they need to use.\n\nWith the right solution, you can discover what applications are running on all workloads and what ports they\u2019re using. This provides a comprehensive inventory of all applications and their dependencies in your network so you can decide how to enforce segmentation policy.\n\n\u200d\n\n3. Lock down your most critical, highest-risk resources\n\nNot all entry points into your network are under your direct control. While a data center for a campus network might have strong controls in place, resources in the cloud or partners\u2019 third-party access are often less secure.\n\nMany threats start from these less-secure environments because they\u2019re often left open due to human error. Any of these access points can be an attacker\u2019s first step in the door, allowing threats to move across your network to your high-value assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dotted lines represent open ports between environments which allow malware to spread through the network.\n\nThat\u2019s where a microsegmentation solution can help you secure these vulnerable parts of your network. No matter where a breach happens, microsegmentation will block it from reaching critical resources that you\u2019ve segmented. The breach will be isolated to the other side of that segment so it can\u2019t cause further damage. \u200d\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Label workloads by business functions, not network addresses\n\nIn today\u2019s modern networks, workloads are deployed across a hybrid, multi-cloud architecture. This makes network addresses ephemeral. A workload\u2019s network address can change dynamically depending on the underlying hosting environment.\n\nThat\u2019s why you should label workloads using human-readable labels rather than traditional IP addresses. With a microsegmentation solution, you can identify workloads by their business function or ownership \u2014 such as their role, application, environment, location, operating system, or business unit \u2014 which is a lot more informative their using an IP address.\n\nBy using human-readable labels, you get a metadata-driven solution for seeing how segments between workloads are enforced that is fully decoupled from network address. \u200d\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Decide on an agent and agentless approach\n\nWhen building microsegmentation, it's important to understand when an agent or agentless approach works best. Some solutions give you a choice between using agents or not so that you can get visibility and segmentation across all workloads in every environment.\n\nAgent approach\n\nCollects telemetry about application use on and between workloads. This allows you to control access to segments directly at the workload.\n\nAgentless approach\n\nDiscovers and enforces the use of segments without an agent.\n\nThis is crucial in environments that can\u2019t support agents, like IoT devices in the manufacturing or healthcare industries. It\u2019s also key in environments that can\u2019t use agents because of compliance requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200d6. Start with a denylist model, then move to an allowlist model\n\nA common challenge teams run into when building microsegmentation is that they know the ports they want to deny, but they don\u2019t fully understand all the ports they need to allow for applications.\n\nRansomware commonly uses ports such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Server Message Block (SMB) to move across segments between workloads. But we know that these ports rarely need to be open between workloads.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s best practice to start with a denylist model. Block only the ports you know shouldn\u2019t be open and allow all others. Then, when you have a full understanding of what ports applications need, you can switch to an allowlist model. Keep only the required ports open and block all others.\n\nThis approach allows you to begin building microsegmentation by ransomware today and tightening policy when you\u2019re ready.\n\n\u200d\n\n7. Model policy before it\u2019s deployed\n\nCybersecurity has long relied on a deploy-and-pray approach. Security teams create a policy model and modify it until it looks correct. Then, when it\u2019s deployed, they pray the phone doesn\u2019t ring from broken application dependencies.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s best to test your policy before it's fully deployed. Modeling ensures your policy can be deployed safely without the risk of inadvertently breaking application dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Extend consistent segmentation across the hybrid multi-cloud\n\nIf you use a solution that can only build segmentation in the data center, then you\u2019re unlikely to get consistent security in other environments like the cloud. Segmentation should never be dependent on a single environment. This will result in a siloed approach to segmentation which will only leave vulnerabilities and make it harder to stop and contain breaches.\n\nInstead, microsegmentation needs to follow the workload as it migrates across environments. This ensures that segmentation doesn\u2019t break as workloads are hosting in different environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200d9. Automate security changes without relying on human decisions\n\nMalware spreads faster than any human can type on a keyboard. It\u2019s crucial to have a microsegmentation solution that can automate policy changes as fast as a breach can spread.\n\n\u200d\n\n10. Prove security is in compliance\n\nQuantifying risk can be challenging, since securing applications and segments can involve many moving parts. During an audit, it\u2019s not always easy to get a clear picture of existing risk and how it\u2019s lowered after security policy is applied. It\u2019s important to use tools that show this before and after comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nChrister Swartz is Solutions Marketing Director at Illumio.

            "article_content": "Getting a glimpse of what goes down in a meat factory will likely make or break your relationship with bacon.\n\nAlthough you might satisfy your curiosity, you might also leave yourself feeling quite sick when you shatter the illusion - so, keep reading at your own risk.\n\nHumans are pretty obsessed with finding out how our favourite foods are made, whether that be iconic crisps like Quavers, crab sticks, or meal deal sandwiches.\n\nAdvert\n\nThis could make or break your relationship with bacon (Getty Stock Image)\n\nBut once you gain that knowledge, there is no going back - and news flash, food processing factories aren't the most appetising places, ironically.\n\nA lot of people who watched Discovery UK's 'How It's Made' clip explaining where bacon comes from said they have been put off the stuff for good.\n\nThe footage, which was uploaded to YouTube in 2018, takes viewers behind-the-scenes in a meat factory to show what steps it takes to get pre-cooked bacon on supermarket shelves.\n\nAdvert\n\nEssentially, a load of pork bellies are put inside of a big tumbler which tosses them around repeatedly, as this softens the slabs of meat and makes it easier to remove the skin.\n\nEach of these pork bellies are then placed skin-side down on a conveyor belt, which takes them on a journey towards a 'long automated blade' that slices the skin off.\n\nPeople have been left stunned after finding out how bacon is made (YouTube/Discovery UK)\n\nBut don't worry, this stuff doesn't go to waste, as they will be used to be processed into pork rinds.\n\nAdvert\n\nMeanwhile, the good stuff is sent along another conveyor belt and towards a flipping device which puts them back-side down, so any excess skin can be hand-removed by staff.\n\nFrom there, the pork is cured in a brine solution before the flavourings are added, the video explained.\n\nSalt is funnelled into a tank of water and mixed thoroughly until it dissolves, before liquid smoke and other tastes are added - and the bellies are then 'repeatedly injected' with this curing concoction.\n\nMetal hangers are pressed into each individual pork belly so they can be hung on a rack and can then head to the 'drench cabinet'... which is where things get a bit weird.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe meat is treated to a 'shower of liquid smoke', in scenes which resemble some kind of horror movie bloodbath, which adds flavour and colour to the porks surface.\n\nThe 'shower of liquid smoke' left viewers stunned (YouTube/Discovery UK)\n\nThese are then cooked for five hours at a low temperature, before being put into a blast freezer to cool them down.\n\nFrom there, they head to another cooler for a few days, which makes the meat 'easier to slice' for when they head to the sizing station to get a quick trim.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"They also pass under a metal detector to confirm that no piece from the metal hanger has gotten lodged in the meat,\" the video explained.\n\nFinally, the pork bellies are put into chutes which sway back and forth over a blade, creating those iconic bacon pieces we all know and love.\n\nThey then tumble onto another conveyor belt to get blasted in a browning microwave, before being packaged and ferried off to supermarkets.\n\nIt's a wild ride, that's for sure - and a lot of people were left with a bad taste in their mouths after finding out the truth about bacon, in particular the 'liquid smoke' element.\n\nOne social media user said: \"'Liquid smoke and other flavouring', yeah...that\u2019s not going in my body again.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"This the last time I look up how something is made.\"\n\nA third added: \"You absolutely know none of these workers eat bacon anymore,\" while a fourth typed: \"People say bacon taste 'good' yet its just the seasonings.\"\n\nA social media user also explained what 'liquid smoke' is actually 'exactly what it says on the tin, commenting: \"burn wood, run the smoke through a condensing column, and then capture the resulting liquid.\"\n\nHowever, other viewers were left with an uncontrollable hankering for bacon after watching the clip, saying nothing could put them off the stuff.\n\nOne chimed in: \"This hasn't reduced my love for bacon in any way, I just think about how much work it takes.\"\n\nAnd a second joked: \"Came here expecting to be put off bacon for life, left wanting bacon.\"\n\nSo, will you still bring home the bacon, or will you be giving it a miss from now on?"

Then years after she was accused of being a 22-year-old, Michael sat down with Natalia to have a very awkward conversation. Watch below:\n\nJust months after Natalia was adopted, the Barnett family claimed she was an 'adult sociopath masquerading as a child' who allegedly tried to kill them.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"She tried to poison and kill my wife,\" Michael claimed, \"One night, I opened my eyes and Natalia is standing at the foot of the bed with a knife in her hand.\"\n\nNatalia has continuously denied all of the allegations made against her. In 2024 documentary Natalia Speaks, health testing company TruDiagnostic estimated that she was then about 22 years old, meaning she was between six and nine years old when she was adopted by the Barnetts.\n\nIn a clip which was released by Investigation Discovery last year, Natalia is seen reuniting with Michael and asking him: \"Why are we here?\"\n\n\"Why are we here?\" responded Michael, \"If you're talking philosophically.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThe confrontation between Natalia Grace and her former adoptive father was very awkward (Investigation Discovery)\n\n\"No, I want to know, why did you adopt me in the first place?\" she then asked.\n\n\"Many of these questions there's not going to be a single answer to,\" he told her, whilst alleging he was manipulated and mistreated by Kristine, his now ex-wife.\n\nIn the documentary, Natalia alleges that she was abused by Kristine, claiming that she pepper-sprayed her multiple times and hit her with a belt.\n\nAdvert\n\nKristine has denied the accusations from both Natalia and Michael.\n\n\"What do you mean by you were a victim?\" Natalia asked, to which Michael replied: \"This is not easy. I had the same monster you did.\"\n\n\"I was exceptionally controlled and put down and threatened, was minimalised, anything that was who I was was ripped from me and I was guided and instructed to be exactly what she wanted me to be,\" he went on.\n\nHe stormed off set (Investigation Discovery)\n\nAdvert\n\nMichael seemed to be getting nowhere with his former adopted daughter and stormed out of the interview following a confrontation with people behind the camera.\n\n\"I tried, I tried,\" he repeated as he walked off set.\n\nHaving made headlines a couple of years ago, Natalia has provided a fresh update in season three of her docuseries, titled The Curious Case of Natalia Grace: The Final Chapter.\n\nNatalia has now settled in with Nicole DePaul, 49, and her husband Vince, 51 - who also have dwarfism - in upstate New York. The couple tried to adopt her in 2009, but were turned down."

The new planet, with a mass six times that of Earth's, orbits a star similar to our Sun. It has been named HD 20794 d and confirmed by an international team of scientists. It was originally found two years ago by Dr Michael Cretignier from Oxford University's physics department and is located in the Eridanus constellation. Dr Cretignier explained: \"With its location in a habitable zone and relatively close proximity to Earth, this planet could play a pivotal role in future missions that will characterise the atmospheres of exoplanets to search for biosignatures indicating potential life.\" He first identified the potential exoplanet signal in 2022 while studying archive data recorded by the HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher) spectrograph at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. Such data analyses light absorbed and emitted by objects.\n\nREAD MORE NASA breakthrough as experts discover there may be life on Uranus moons\n\nThe new planet has a mass six times that of Earth\n\nThe expert spotted periodic shifts in the spectrum of light emitted by the host star, which Oxford University said could have been caused by a nearby planet's gravitational pull. At the time of Dr Cretignier's initial discovery, it was unclear if the signal was caused by a planet, the star or if it was just a technical glitch. Members from the international team of scientists studied \"highly-precise\" measurements taken over 20 years by HARPS and the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO). The two instruments are among the most advanced in the world for measuring tiny variations in light. Detailed in a new study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, the discovery also relied on data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Dr Cretignier said scientists worked on the data for years, analysing and eliminating possible sources of contamination to pinpoint the planet's signal. The discovery was confirmed after the results from HARPS and ESPRESSO were combined.\n\nThe new planet was originally found two years ago (file image)\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "Scan a few headlines and you\u2019ll find, broadly speaking, that there are two schools of thought around the implications of artificial intelligence: the Cassandras and the Polyannas. But Reid Hoffman, a leading voice on the subject, wouldn\u2019t classify himself as either. \u201cThere are dramatics,\u201d he tells me, \u201con both sides.\u201d\n\nHoffman, a cofounder of LinkedIn, has been deeply ensconced in the field of machine learning since 2015, when he became a founding investor in OpenAI, originally a nonprofit lab that burst into public consciousness when it hard-launched ChatGPT seven years later. Since then, AI, once consigned to the realm of science fiction, has become a subject of endless allure and agita.\n\nAI fans divine that the technology will revolutionize industries like health care, retail, law, and manufacturing. Critics fear that it will douse fuel onto society\u2019s proverbial fires, from misinformation to privacy violations to economic disruption; some naysayers even worry that humanity itself will become obsolete. That\u2019s also to say nothing of the AI arms race that\u2019s simmering across the Atlantic: US markets were rattled Monday by the latest from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which now offers breakthrough AI technology at a fraction of the cost.\n\nPerhaps the only thing we do know for certain about AI is that its future is uncertain. And that, Hoffman tells me, is the impetus of his forthcoming book, Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right With Our AI Future. In it, Hoffman and his coauthor, Greg Beato, make a full-throated case for AI as \u201csomething that society explores and discovers collectively.\u201d They encourage readers to engage with AI\u2014rather than shy away from it\u2014and contend that too much regulatory oversight will only entrench economic inequities and delay the inevitable march of technological progress. \u201cOnce set in motion, new technologies exert a gravity of their own,\u201d Hoffman and Beato write. \u201cThat is precisely why prohibition or constraint alone are never enough: they offer stasis and resistance at the very moment we should be pushing forward in pursuit of the brightest possible future.\u201d\n\nIn an interview that has been edited for length and clarity, Hoffman explains how AI will usher in a \u201ccognitive industrial revolution,\u201d opens up about the \u201cpainful parts\u201d of the transition, and explains why he thinks Silicon Valley\u2019s political proximity to Donald Trump is, in fact, in the public\u2019s best interest. \u201cI actually have a higher worry about governments that are so ignorant about technology,\u201d he says, \u201cthat by the fact that they\u2019re so separated, [they] basically miscall the play, including regulating in really bad ways.\u201d Following our interview, Hoffman also spoke to this week\u2019s concerns around DeepSeek, saying in a statement that the development \u201cdemonstrates how immediate and strong the competitive talent from China is and why it\u2019s crucial for America to continue to be at the forefront of AI development.\u201d\n\nVanity Fair: You were a founding investor of OpenAI, a company that was pretty much an unknown quantity to people outside Silicon Valley back when it was founded in 2015. Seven years later, it becomes a global phenomenon after rolling out ChatGPT to the public. What\u2019s it been like watching society\u2019s introduction to AI, something that you\u2019ve long believed in but was thought by probably a lot of people to be in the realm of science fiction?\n\nReid Hoffman: I would say a little amusing on a couple of vectors. One is, part of the reason I wrote the book is because a lot of people are responding out of fear and uncertainty. I wrote the book to say, hey, we only get a really positive future by steering toward it and not by just trying to avoid the futures we don\u2019t like.\n\nAnother one was that you\u2019re constantly getting a combination of skepticism and, to some degree, frankly, overhype. And that doesn\u2019t mean that I am not a massive believer, and that this is going to be the cognitive industrial revolution, and that it\u2019s going to make a difference in individuals\u2019 lives on the order of the industrial revolution. So I think it\u2019s going to be very big. On the other hand, you end up getting in a lot of science fiction conversations, which is a little bemusing. There\u2019s dramatics on both sides. There\u2019s dramatics on, \u201cWell, in three years AI will be inventing fusion for us and climate change will be solved!\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cWell, I hope so. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Or, \u201cThe killer robots are coming for us and we should be bombing all the AI development factories right now.\u201d And so it\u2019s like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s in the cards right now either.\u201d"
