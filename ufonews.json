We may never know.\n\nCarbondale will celebrate its alien mystery with its first-ever Carbondalien festival that kicks off Thursday morning at 11.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "article_content": "Donald Trump promised to get busy remaking the US in his image from his first day in office after his election victory over Kamala Harris.\n\nMany policies on his wide-reaching agenda, though radical, cover bread-and-butter issues like immigration, the economy, and education.\n\nHe vowed mass deportations for undocumented migrants and asylum-seekers, a worrying purge of the public service, and controversial tariffs on China.\n\nBut Trump also made other promises from the unconventional to the bizarre that he may or may not implement, but will certainly be talking points from day one.\n\nDonald Trump declares victory over Kamala Harris in the 2024 election\n\nDeclassifying JFK assassination files\n\nThe assassination of President John F Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963, has fascinated the American public for decades - even after the Warren Commission ruled shooter Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.\n\nThe secrecy around the investigation and claims of other gunmen and plots by the CIA, Cuba, and the Soviets fueled persistent conspiracy theories.\n\nIn 1992, a law was brought in which declared that all the documents about the assassination should be made publicly available by 2017, by which time Trump was in the White House.\n\nAbout 320,000 files were supposed to be released, but the law allowed officials to postpone some of them on privacy and national security grounds.\n\nTrump delayed the release of some documents until 2021 for those reasons, and released another 19,045 in 2018 with redactions.\n\nPresident John F Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas on November 22, 1963. This is his motorcade minutes before he was shot\n\nThe Warren Commission ruled shooter Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, but there are persistent conspiracy theories\n\nJoe Biden again delayed the release of those files, but made about 13,000 more public over the course of his presidency so far.\n\nBut after securing the endorsement of Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is JFK's nephew, Trump promised to make all the rest public and pledged to do so 'early' in his presidency.\n\n'This is a tribute in honor of Bobby. I will establish a new independent presidential commission on assassination attempts, and they will be tasked with releasing all of the remaining documents pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy,' he said at a rally in Phoenix in August.\n\nRFK Jr believes the CIA was involved in his uncle's murder and wants the files made public to prove it.\n\nTrump said the new commission would investigate all presidential assassination attempts, including his own.\n\nAfter securing the endorsement of Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is JFK's nephew, Trump promised to make all the rest of the documents public\n\nHe reiterated his plan to release the JFK documents on a podcast with right wing personality Lex Fridman on September 3.\n\n'They also are pushing me on Kennedy, and I did release a lot, but I had people come to me and beg me not to do it. But I'll be doing that very early on,' he said.\n\n'Kennedy's interesting because it's so many years ago. They do that for danger too, because it endangers certain people, etc etc.'\n\nTrump previously said he got a lot of pushback in his efforts to declassify the files when he was president.\n\nGerald Posner, who wrote the 1993 Kennedy assassination book Case Closed, said wasn't so sure Trump would follow through.\n\n'You had an opportunity to do it, you said you were going to do it, and you didn't do it,' he told the Washington Post.\n\n'Now, with the RFK Jr endorsement, maybe that's a quid pro quo, and maybe this time he'll actually do it.'\n\nExposing the 'truth' about UFOs\n\nTrump claims the question he is asked most about his time in office is what he learned about extraterrestrial contact.\n\nHe was asked on the Fridman podcast if he would 'help push the Pentagon to release more footage (of UFOs), which a lot of people claim is available'.\n\n'Oh yeah, sure, I'll do that. I would do that. I'd love to do that. I have to do that,' he replied.\n\nTrump's comment, along with his history of giving credence to UFO theories, sparked excitement about what he would expose.\n\nUFO 'expert' Nick Pope claimed there was a 'strong possibility of bombshell UFO information being released' next year.\n\n'It's the perfect storm: a maverick, populist President in his second term, and \u2013 thus \u2013 not up for re-election,' he told The Mirror.\n\n'For those in the UFO community who believe there's been a decades-long conspiracy to cover up the truth about an alien presence, Trump in his second term offers the best-ever hope for pushing back against the Deep State and delivering Disclosure.\n\n'I believe Trump views the subject in the same way as he views the JFK files, where, if there's top secret information still being withheld, it should be declassified and released.'\n\nTrump has on several occasions claimed American military pilots shared UFO sightings with him that they couldn't explain.\n\n'I have met with pilots... they are not conspiratorial, they are not crazy, and they tell me stories that they've seen things that you wouldn't believe,' he said in June.\n\nHe told influencer Logan Paul that he believed there was something out there.\n\n'It's very possible there is something. And why wouldn't there be? You look at the universe and you see all of the different planets and you see... look, here we are, one relatively small planet.\n\n'Why wouldn't there be, on a planet that's 400 times the size? Why wouldn't there be something, somebody?'\n\nThis position is still very different to believing aliens have actually visited Earth, and the CIA's official position is still that they have not.\n\nTrump elaborated on his UFO thoughts in his podcast with Joe Rogan, again citing conversations with pilots\n\nTrump elaborated on his UFO thoughts in his podcast with Joe Rogan, again citing conversations with pilots.\n\n'I interviewed a few people, it's never been my thing, I have to be honest. I have never been a believer,' he said.\n\n'So I interviewed jet pilots that say they saw something. If you saw them you'd love to have them [on your show]...that were solid people, perfect, great pilots, everything.\n\n'And they said, 'we saw things sir that were very strange, like a round ball that wasn't a comet or meteor, it was something and it was going four times faster than an F22, which is a very fast plane.\n\n'And it was round, which in theory is a great shape [for flying].'\n\nTrump added that while the sighted UFOs 'could be' drones or Chinese spy balloons, he remained swayed by the eyewitness accounts of the fighter pilots he spoke to.\n\nHe added: [They are] solid, beautiful people. [They said] this is something sir, this is something. They're not conspiracy guys.'\n\nReleasing the 'Epstein files'\n\nMany Trump fans, including Elon Musk, want him to release all documents relating to the investigation of billionaire child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEpstein, who hung himself in jail, flew numerous well-heeled friends to his private Caribbean island, Little Saint James, where some of them sexually abused children.\n\nThe billionaire was known to have many famous friends and acquaintances in Hollywood, politics, and business, and many Americans want to know their level of involvement in his dealings.\n\nSome documents became public last year from a defamation case with his alleged victim Virginia Roberts in 2015, but no one famous was incriminated.\n\nThere are rumors of a 'client list' but it has never been proved to actually exist.\n\nMany Trump fans, including Elon Musk, want him to release all documents relating to the investigation of billionaire child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein (pictured in jail)\n\nTrump was asked abut released Epstein-related documents during the Fridman podcast, including if the supposed 'client list' would be made public.\n\n'It's very interesting, isn't it? It probably will be, by the way, probably,' he said.\n\n'I'd certainly take a look at it. Now... Kennedy is very different from the Epstein thing but I'd be inclined to do the Epstein. I'd have no problem with it.'\n\nTrump appeared more cautious in another interview, wary that people could be smeared by potential lies contained in the files.\n\n'Yeah, yeah, I would. I guess I would because... I think that less so because, you know, you don't know you don't want to affect people's lives if it's phony stuff in there because it's a lot of phony stuff with that world,' he said.\n\n'But I think I would or at least... Yeah I don't know about Epstein so much as I do the others (the JFK assassination and 9/11 files).'\n\nTrump himself knew Epstein and was photographed with him (this one at Mar-a-Lago in 1997), but has consistently downplayed his involvement\n\nTrump with Melania, Epstein, and the billionaire sex offender's right-hand women Ghislaine Maxwell at Mar-a-Lago club on February 12, 2000\n\nTrump himself knew Epstein and was photographed with him, but has consistently downplayed his involvement.\n\n'I'm not involved. I never went to his island, fortunately, but a lot of people did,' he said on the Fridman podcast.\n\nHowever, hours of recorded interviews with Epstein by author Michael Wolff, who interviewed the billionaire for his Trump book Fire and Fury - well before his hideous crimes were exposed - told a different story.\n\nEpstein, in the recordings given to the Daily Beast, called Trump his 'closest friend' and spoke extensively of their relationship.\n\n'Freedom cities' and flying cars\n\nTrump, in a March 2023 campaign ad, said he planned to build 10 new cities on federal land he referred to as 'freedom cities'.\n\n'In other words, we'll actually build new cities in our country again,' he said.\n\n'These Freedom Cities will reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and in fact, the American Dream.'\n\nTrump waxed lyrical about how past generations had 'big dreams' and pursued impossible projects, but the country had 'lost its boldness'.\n\n'Under my leadership, we will get it back in a very big way. If you look at just three years ago, what we were doing was unthinkable, how good it was, how great it was for our country,' he said.\n\n'Our objective will be a quantum leap in the American standard of living.'\n\nThe freedom cities plan hasn't been mentioned since then, and may go the way of another bizarre idea from Trump's first term - buying Greenland from Denmark.\n\nIn the same video Trump said he planned to fill American driveways with flying cars and declared 'America, not China, leads the revolution in air mobility'.\n\n'Dozens of major companies in the US and China are racing to develop vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles for families and individuals,' he said.\n\n'Just as the United States led the automotive revolution in the last century, I want to ensure that America, not China, leads this revolution in air mobility.\n\n'These breakthroughs can transform commerce, bring a giant infusion of wealth into rural America, and connect families and our country in new ways.'\n\nSome companies are working on these projects, but they are a lot further off than the end of Trump's second term, if they are ever feasible."

        "article_content": "Amazon is considering investing billions of dollars in Anthropic, doubling down on a huge deal the companies struck this year, The Information reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne reason Amazon is so keen on Anthropic: The AI startup has been gaining on its rival OpenAI in recent months, according to data from a popular developer tool.\n\nThe AI SDK is a tool kit that helps developers build AI-powered applications. It provides code libraries that developers install to get their apps to communicate with different AI models. Data is published regularly showing how many times these code packages are downloaded each week.\n\nThis is a useful window into how popular the top AI models are with developers, a key constituency of early tech adopters.\n\nThe data shows that OpenAI remains in the lead but that Anthropic has been growing faster lately in terms of developer mindshare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the week of August 18, developers downloaded the OpenAI code library almost 229,000 times. The equivalent Anthropic library was downloaded almost 38,000 times.\n\nIn late October, OpenAI downloads were relatively unchanged, while Anthropic downloads were much higher: about 244,000 for OpenAI and 100,000 for Anthropic.\n\nData from NPM Trends. NPM Trends\n\nThe recent adoption trends can be partly explained by a new AI model Anthropic released in June.\n\n\"Anthropic's recent gains can be attributed to their Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, which, among many tasks, excels at understanding and generating code,\" said Jared Palmer, a vice president of AI at Vercel, a startup that offers the AI SDK and other developer tools. \"Its combination of speed, cost, and output quality has won over the developer community for the time being.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet has been particularly useful for tasks that developers need to do regularly, such as generating, checking, and fixing software code.\n\nStill, OpenAI has maintained its lead among developers because of its first-mover advantage and factors such as cheap pricing of its GPT-4o-mini AI model and strong developer tooling and documentation.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThere's also pretty widespread adoption of its API, or application programming interface. This is a common way for different software applications to communicate and share data.\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that OpenAI's lead is inflated by the download data. That's because many AI-model providers have adopted OpenAI's API specification as a de facto standard. That allows developers to use the same OpenAI code library package but point their apps to different models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's hard to quantify how much this exaggerates OpenAI's lead, but the inflation of OpenAI's numbers here supports the general conclusion that Anthropic has been gaining on its main rival in recent months.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said usage of the startup's API had doubled since it released its GPT-4o mini AI model in July. The spokesperson added that OpenAI had also tripled the number of active apps running in production on its platform in the past year.\n\nThe OpenAI spokesperson criticized the data, saying downloads of these code libraries aren't an accurate representation of developer audience since they don't reflect actual usage or spending.\n\nAnthropic had no problem with the data. The company said its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model helped developers handle complex software architecture and multistep processes. It added that enterprises were increasingly adopting Claude for business-critical functions where accuracy is key, such as software development and data analysis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Our new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model is the ideal choice for developers to build AI-powered applications with state-of-the-art performance across the board, including coding, complex financial analysis, and live chat support,\" Dianne Penn, a product lead at Anthropic, told Business Insider.\n\nPenn cited DoorDash, Sourcegraph, and GitLab as companies using Claude to reduce development time, increase code acceptance rates, and build AI features."

        "article_content": "AppLovin has been a huge AI winner this year.\n\nMove over Nvidia and Palantir Technologies, AppLovin (APP 17.64%) took over as the top-performing artificial intelligence (AI) stock in 2024 thanks to the share price surge that followed the release of its third-quarter results. The price jump puts the stock up about 628% year to date as of Nov. 9.\n\nAppLovin owns a portfolio of gaming apps but its primary business is an adtech solution to help mobile app developers attract users and better monetize their apps. Since the launch of its Axon 2 AI-based advertising technology in the second quarter of 2023, the company has seen explosive growth.\n\nLet's take a close look at the company's Q3 results and whether the stock is still a buy.\n\nAxon 2 continues to drive growth\n\nAxon 2 has been the source behind nearly all of AppLovin's growth, with its software platform revenue soaring 66% to $835 million. The company's legacy apps business, meanwhile, saw revenue increase 1% to $369 million. Overall revenue climbed 39% to $1.2 billion, topping the $1.13 billion consensus as compiled by LSEG.\n\nThe company continues to see a ton of operating leverage in its business as sales climb, with gross margin for the quarter improving to 77.5% from 69.3% a year ago. The revenue surge also came despite the company reducing its sales and marketing spend by 3%. That combination is quite remarkable.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) surged from $0.30 a year ago to $1.25. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), meanwhile, climbed 72% to $722 million. Software platform adjusted EBITDA jumped 78% to $653 million, while its apps business grew adjusted EBITDA by 19% to $68 million as the company optimized the business's cost structure.\n\nThe company produced $551 million in operating cash flow and $545 million in free cash flow. It ended the quarter with $2.9 billion in net debt.\n\nAppLovin guided for fourth-quarter revenue to come in a range of $1.24 billion to $1.26 billion. That would equate to growth of between 30% and 32% and is above the company's long-term goal to grow revenue by between 20% and 30%. It is projecting Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be between $475 million and $495 million, up from $476 million a year ago.\n\nIs the stock still a buy?\n\nAppLovin has proven to be one of the biggest AI winners, as its Axon 2 AI adtech platform has led to soaring revenue with its gaming customers. At the same time, it has seen a ton of operating leverage in its business, being able to realize tremendous growth while not increasing its sales and marketing spend and improving its gross margin.\n\nThe company expects consistent growth of between 20% and 30% from its gaming customers, but it has also just started piloting the platform with e-commerce. It has said early results are tracking above expectations and that it thinks this vertical can scale next year and start being a strong contributor. Moving beyond gaming is a huge potential opportunity for the company.\n\nWith its stock up about 628% year to date, the company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has risen to 47 based on 2025 analyst estimates. Its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio now sits at 1.28. A PEG ratio of under 1 is considered undervalued and growth stocks will often command multiples well above 1.\n\nI've written favorably about AppLovin several times this year, going as far back as April, while in June I listed it as one of two stocks that I thought could go parabolic. While the stock and its valuation have greatly increased since then, I think there could still be more upside ahead.\n\nIf AppLovin can continue to grow revenue at a 30% pace while keeping expenses in check, its valuation is reasonable. Meanwhile, if it is able to move beyond gaming with Axon 2, the sky remains the limit.\n\nWhile I think it is prudent for investors with big gains to take some profits, I'd still be holding onto the stock even after this incredible run in its share price."

Here are some of the eeriest encounters people recalled:\n\n1.\"I once woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of my bedroom door creaking open. I could see the outline of someone standing there, but when I turned on the light, there was no one. The door started slowly closing as if whoever or whatever had been there was leaving. Even creepier, my Nest fire alarm had illuminated in the corridor, sensing movement, but nobody was there. Still gives me chills thinking about it.\"\n\n\u2013justheway\n\n2.\"One night, when I was 14 years old, I heard the shower turn on around midnight or some ungodly hour. I assumed it was just my mom. I tried to go back to sleep for ages and couldn't. I just lay there waiting and waiting. Ages went by. I went to check to ensure she hadn't fallen or something. No one was in there, and the shower was on full blast. I was terrified. I had to turn it off, and in doing so, I felt a wave of dread wash over me. I ran back to my room and hid.\"\n\n\u2013Left_Pear4817\n\nDouglas Sacha / Getty Images\n\n3.\"My grandparents own a very old, large mansion where my three siblings and I spent a lot of time. We each had our own bedrooms, and one night, my sister begged me to sleep in her room because she was scared. We were both watching TV when suddenly, I saw a woman with long dark hair dressed in a sundress walk from the library, past my sister's doorframe, and down the hall. I jumped up to look down the hall just in time for the woman to look back at me, round the corner, and disappear. My sister raced over, slamming the door in front of my face. She was almost in tears, blubbering, 'She'll be back. Please don't open the door! I don't want to see her again!'\"\n\n\"The door had a large square hole where a metal grate sat for proper ventilation, but it was removed for cleaning at the time. I saw the woman's legs walk past the door through that hole several times during the night. To this day, my sister won't talk about it, and she kicked me out of her room once the metal grate was put back on the door.\"\n\n\u2013Limited_two\n\n4.\"When my grandpa died, almost all of the family was around his bed. We put some candles on the nightstand. A few seconds after he died, the flames of the candles started burning so intensely that the height grew about 10 times bigger. They stayed like that for about 10 seconds before returning to their normal size. I don't know if my grandpa's soul leaving his body caused some kind of combustion, but it was weird, and we had no explanation for it. All my uncles saw it, but no one has talked about it since.\"\n\n\u2013xlake1\n\nFhm / Getty Images\n\n5.\"My best friend and I would always talk about our wild dreams. He told me about one where he got hit by a car and died. We were about 15 or 16 when he told me about the dream (we were into things like aliens, the paranormal, and lucid dreaming, so we'd talk about stuff like that a lot), and he died right before he would've turned 20. In the dream, he said he was riding a skateboard wearing all black when this car hit him. He said he could see everyone at his funeral (he even said his crush was at his funeral and laughed about it). He just kept going on about how it was so real, and it shook me up until I eventually forgot about it. Then, a few years later, after I'd long forgotten about the dream, it happened for real.\"\n\n\"He did get hit by a car and die. His crush was at his funeral. He was wearing all black like in the dream (his work clothes) and riding my skateboard. It was all true, and I still don't know what to make of it. Every detail I remember from his dream came true, and I'm sure there are parts he told me that I don't remember. I felt like I was losing my mind. I didn't tell anyone about it. I just don't know why or how he saw it happen in his dream. I have so many questions, but I guess now I have proof, at least for myself, that our souls go on after we die. I just wish I knew why he experienced that dream and told me about it; there must be some reason. I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't experienced it myself. Has anyone ever experienced anything similar?\"\n\n\u2013johnnyb1917\n\n6.\"I grew up in an old farmhouse in Alabama. A lot of weird stuff happened there, but the memory that sticks out the most was the night when everyone in my immediate family saw the same thing. We were watching TV in the living room (five of us), and from the living room, you could see directly into the dining room. We first noticed a sound in the dining room, like paper crunching. I don't remember who heard it first, but one of us asked if anyone else heard it. Then it happened again. We all turned and looked into the dining room, and the blinds on the window raised all the way up, hung there for about three seconds, and then crashed back down. No one else was in the house. We still talk about it today. No explanation, just scary.\"\n\n\u2013StrangeMagic83\n\nZhihao / Getty Images\n\n7.\"The day before my grandfather died, he told my brother and me that he'd be waiting at the bar to buy us a beer in the future. Skip ahead to about a month after his passing. I had a very short, VERY vivid dream where I walked into a bar I didn't recognize, and my grandpa was there. He spun his chair around and had a beer in each hand. He said, 'You guys ready for that beer?' I looked to the right, and my brother was standing next to me. I SNAPPED awake so fast I scared the crap out of my wife and dog. I was panting and totally freaked out. I went to check my phone to see what time it was, and as I picked it up, I got a text from my brother saying, \"Hey, I just had a fucked up dream.' Yeah. Same dream.\"\n\n\u2013FloridaIsHell\n\n8.\"I was biking home one evening when I was 9. We lived in the countryside up a small mountain. The road from the village started uphill, then had a flat section, and then went uphill again. The street lights only stretched to the end of the flat section. I was afraid of the dark, so I stopped at the end of the street lights at the bottom of the last hill to gather the courage to bike the final section home. It was a partial moon, so it wasn't pitch black, and at the end of the final hill, I saw a figure walking down towards me. I thought I'd wait until they got closer because I'd feel less afraid to bike in the dark if someone else was close. But, about halfway down the hill, the 'person' walked into a thin shadow of a tree on the road and never returned. They just disappeared.\"\n\n\"I stood there for a while and tried to figure out what I'd just seen. Then I panicked, biked down to the village, and decided to stay there until my parents drove down, wondering why I had never come home. They tried rationalizing it by saying the person might've gone into the woods. They didn't disclose, though, out of fear that I'd never dare to bike home again, that my father had seen the same thing walking home from work. He had seen her clear as day, walking down the hill for a while. When he looked down for a moment and looked up, she was gone, and there were no footsteps in the fresh snow.\n\nI later read a book about local legends, and apparently, for at least a century, many people have seen her walking down the hill and disappearing halfway down. My youngest daughter loved this story, so we've been on ghost stakeouts where we buy pizzas and snacks and hang out at the bottom of the hill, listening to the Ghostbusters theme song and trying to see the ghost.\"\n\n\u2013SmalandOutdoor\n\nRbkomar / Getty Images\n\n9.\"I had a sleepover with my best friend (we were in our 20s), and I slept on the couch. The couch had a direct line of sight all the way down her hallway to the bedrooms. I woke up from a dead sleep around 4:00 a.m., sat up, and looked down the hallway. At the end was a woman. She looked at me for a second, then turned and walked through one of the bedroom doors. I heard the door open and close, even though it never moved. The next day, I told my friend about it. She said, 'Oh, so you saw the woman! My mom and I see the woman. Dad and my brother always see a little girl.' As far as I know, the woman and/or little girl still hang around the house. Her family still sees them sometimes.\"\n\n\u2013morganalefaye125\n\n10.\"I studied in the UK during college and lived in a house with other American students. They all had stories about the ghost of a girl who passed away while living there. I never believed in any of it, but it was fun to play along. The kitchen had one way in and out, and right after you entered the kitchen, to your right was a padlocked door to the cellar where the ghost allegedly lived. I had the only key. We were all a little homesick near Thanksgiving, so we decided to do a meal together. This required some creative cooking schedules due to small appliances in the kitchen, so one girl who didn't have class the following day offered to stay up late to get the turkey going. We went into the cellar the first (and only) time that evening to get larger cooking tools.\"\n\n\"At 2:04 a.m., I woke up to my door rattling like someone was pushing against it. I assumed it was a housemate who just went to the wrong door. About 30 seconds later, I heard a scratchy female voice softly say, 'Hello?' which repeated every five seconds or so. My window was open, and it sounded like the voice was coming from outside, so I got up to close it. I assumed it was some drunk girl walking back from the pub. I went to the window, and there was no one there. I heard 'Hello?' again behind me, clear as a bell, then my door rattled again, then fell silent.\n\nI've had night terrors before and hallucinate when I have even a mild fever, so I assumed I was still asleep and laid back down. The following day at 7:00 a.m., the girl who was cooking told me, 'I had the creepiest night. At 1:50, I heard footsteps coming up the cellar stairs, then the door rattled. Then, at 2:10, the door rattled again, and I heard footsteps coming down.' She told me this before I had said anything to anyone about what I'd experienced.\"\n\n\u2013ProfessorBeer\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n\n11.\"I went to college in Providence, Rhode Island. My dorm room housed my roommate and me, and we had our beds on opposite sides of the room, with our desks by the foot of each bed. Anyway, my boyfriend and I were hanging out in my room one day, and he was lying on my bed. I was up next to the bed and bent over to grab something. I heard him scream, and he covered his eyes (not exaggerating), but he wouldn't tell me why. Eventually, he told me that when I bent over, he saw a shadow behind me that actually kind of looked like him, and it freaked him out. He had an afro, so the silhouette would've been pretty distinctive. We didn't really talk about it afterward, and I never told my roommate (she wasn't in the room at the time).\"\n\n\"A few weeks later, I was asleep in bed with my boyfriend. I woke up in the middle of the night to my roommate packing a bag, clearly panicked. She rushed out of the room and didn't see me wake up, so I didn't say anything. The following day, I saw her and asked her why she had rushed out of the room in the middle of the night. She told me she woke up in the middle of the night and saw my boyfriend sitting at my desk. She asked him why he was up, then saw my boyfriend sleeping beside me! She believed in ghosts, so she freaked and left.\n\nIt freaked me out because we hadn't mentioned the 'lookalike' my boyfriend saw to her, and it sounded like she saw the same figure.\"\n\n\u2013Expensive_Plant4586\n\n12.\"I was on a cruise with a friend, and we shared a cabin. My friend was a really loud snorer. He would usually stay awake until I'd fallen asleep; otherwise, I'd find it impossible to sleep with the racket he was making. That night, he'd had a few drinks and passed out drunk, snoring loudly. It didn't bother me, as I had my book to read. It was about 2:00 a.m., and I was wide awake, reading my book in bed. I got this feeling there was something at the foot of the bed. I glanced up, and there was this' thing.' It looked like a person but translucent and gray, and the features were blurry. It was a bit like if a person was made of television static. I felt like it was being inquisitive, like how a young child would watch you do something.\"\n\n\"In my head, I asked what it wanted, and as I did, it turned and walked across the room to the door. As it did, it disappeared. I didn't feel scared or threatened by it. No idea what it was. I don't drink or take drugs, so it wasn't that, and I was wide awake. Odd. Really odd.\"\n\n\u2013Ana_Phases\n\nCatherine Mcqueen / Getty Images\n\n13.\"About 25 years ago, my now ex-wife and I were caretakers of a house. We had been there for several weeks and noticed that we always had a funny feeling coming up the cellar stairs. It felt like something was going to grab us as soon as we turned the light switch off. Everything else about the house was normal. We slept with an analog windup alarm clock next to the bed \u2014 the kind that actually ticks. To set the alarm, you had to move a tiny third hand to the location on the clock face for the desired time. For example, you'd put the hand halfway between 6:00 and 7:00 to awaken at 6:30 a.m. It's a physical process, and it's difficult to get wrong.\"\n\n\"We always had the clock set to wake us up at 6:00 a.m. It was not something we fiddled with daily. One night, the alarm clock went off at about 2:00 a.m., playing old-school ringing bells. Both my ex-wife and I woke up absolutely terrified. I saw a small figure, maybe two feet tall, run out of the room. I thought I must've been imagining it until my ex-wife screamed, 'Did you just see that thing?' We both described it as some sort of small gremlin. When we looked at the alarm clock, we saw that the alarm hand had been moved from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. It scared the crap out of me. I have no explanation for it. Nothing else ever happened there, but the cellar feeling persisted.\"\n\n\u2013theferalforager\n\n14.\"When I was a kid, my grandpa was the night shift custodian of a big old-school church building. My sister and I used to go with him some nights because they had a big gymnasium-type room with a ton of big exercise balls and stuff, and it was fun to run around. One night, while my grandpa was locking a room up, my sister and I heard a noise down the stairs behind us. We looked, and an old lady was leaving the building. She turned, looked at us, and made the 'shhh' motion with her finger to her lips, then she left. We didn't think too much of it at the time. We asked our grandpa if anyone else was in the building tonight (like for any meetings, classes, etc.), and he said no, it was just us in the entire building. We asked him where the door down the stairs led, and he said, 'Oh, that goes out to the cemetery.' My sister and I FREAKED out. We still talk about it today and have the same memory of it.\"\n\n\u2013ziggs4lyfe\n\nGeorgepeters / Getty Images\n\n15.\"Back in college, my girlfriend and I would go back to her parents' old farmhouse and fool around after class. There was never anybody home. One afternoon, I was standing in her kitchen, thirstily guzzling a post-sex Gatorade. Behind me was a back staircase leading to the house's second floor. When I finished my drink and turned to leave the room, I noticed a little girl between 7 and 10 years old standing on the bottom step. My first thought was, 'Oh crap. Why didn't my girlfriend tell me a little girl was in the house? I really hope she didn't hear what we were up to!' But before I could speak, I realized something was off. She was semi-transparent and oddly two-dimensional in a way I can't articulate. Slowly, I realized that I was staring at a ghost.\"\n\n\"There was nothing inherently frightening about the experience. Knowing I was in the presence of something unexplainable, I did everything in my power not to blink. I stared at her for 10 to 15 seconds, taking in every detail I could. She was wearing a red and yellow summer dress. Her long blonde hair was tied into two old-timey braids at the end. She wore black strapped shoes. Overall, her look gave me a 1940s\u20141970s vibe.\n\nFortunately for her, she seemed to have no idea I existed. She stood on the bottom step, looking out the back window towards the driveway like she was waiting for someone to arrive. I never took my eyes off her, but she was eventually gone. I never believed in ghosts before that. I still don't believe in intelligent hauntings, but I'll certainly entertain the idea of residual energy and echoes of the past.\"\n\n\u2013ThroatBabies\n\n16.\"My grandfather had died a few days earlier, and my mom was crying in our kitchen. I hugged her. We had a lot of my grandfather's belongings, but there was this broken radio that didn't even have working batteries on the table, along with other things like photos and clothes he previously owned. This is the only unexplainable thing I've ever experienced, but while my mom was bawling, the radio made a very loud static noise for about one second. We both stared in silence at it. It was eerie! She stopped crying when she heard it. We both went to bed after that and haven't spoken of it since. If it were something paranormal, I'd imagine it was my grandfather letting us know he was there.\"\n\n\u2013One-Ad8707\n\nSutthiwat Srikhrueadam / Getty Images\n\n17.\"The basement in my dad's house is finished except for the storage room. It's really dark and creepy and is around the corner from the basement's main room. There's an elliptical down there, and when standing on the elliptical, if you look over your shoulder, you can see half of the door to the storage room. I was working out on said elliptical, and I felt like someone was standing behind me, so I looked over my shoulder. In that half doorway, a dark figure with light gray eyes stood there looking at me. I was house-sitting, so I knew there wasn't anyone else home. I slowly got off the elliptical and went into the bathroom to hide; a while later, I decided to be bold and rush past the storage room and back upstairs. It was not my first time seeing that gray-eyed figure either.\"\n\n\u2013Conscious-Outside430\n\n18.\"I used to work for a company where I would go into foreclosed homes. I went into this one house with a coworker, and from the moment I stepped into the yard, I felt I was being watched. We went inside, and I felt I was being watched the entire time. And I kept seeing black, swirling shadows standing in the corner of every room. I saw them out of the corner of my eye, and when I'd look directly at them, they'd be gone. At one point, we heard the basement door SLAM shut. My coworker and I said, 'OK, I think we're done for the day.' When we were leaving, I asked the coworker if that house was weird, and he said yeah, he kept seeing black shadows in the corners. I remember getting chills. I refused to ever go back to that house.\"\n\n\u2013Genghishahn44\n\nZimmytws / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n19.\"I saw a completely identical 'copy' of me at a beach in California. They were wearing different clothes than I was at the time, but they were still wearing clothes I owned. As soon as I tried approaching him to get a picture, he started to run away down the shoreline at full speed. A strange experience for sure.\"\n\n\u2013psychedelicious13\n\n20.\"I was around 10 years old, and my grandma had just died. I didn't really know her because she had spent most of my young life in a nursing home and often didn't remember who I was when I went to visit. But, when I visited, she would always rub my back. It was like an instinctual way to comfort someone. She did it to all her kids and grandkids. For about a year after she died, I would be sitting in my room at night, alone, and start to feel someone rubbing my back like she used to. It freaked me out until I acknowledged it one night and said, 'Thank you, grandma.' It stopped after that, and I never felt it again.\"\n\n\u2013sillybanana2012\n\nRalf Nau / Getty Images\n\n21.\"I grew up in a haunted house in Canada. From ages 7 to 18, I saw and experienced a lot that I cannot and will not attempt to explain. The house was obviously haunted. We had doors slamming, orbs, shadows, and electronic phenomena. You name it, and this house had it. Whatever resided there was never malicious to any of us \u2014 it was maybe even playful when we were kids. I was not afraid of it, just a little confused. I feel like this background will give a little context to what happened last week. Last week, my wife and I flew to York, England. It is a lovely town made even more special by the people who live in, curate, and care for it. We spent three days wandering around, shopping, and drinking pints with the locals. Part of that shopping involved going into a four-story antique store by The Minster.\"\n\n\"The first floor was really cool and had lots of houseware from a bygone era. The second floor was all records, and the third floor was curiosities gathered from a life of travel. The fourth floor was messed up. As my wife and I rounded the banister, it felt like I walked into the saddest, angriest place I have ever been. On one wall were WW1 medals, on the other were WW2 medals, and in the middle was a rocking horse.\n\nI felt like I had to run for my life. The darkness that saturated every inch of that room was indescribably terrifying. I abandoned my beautiful wife in a room with the darkest presence I have ever experienced. I sprinted from the building and sat on the front steps, waiting for my wife to come down and ask what was wrong with me.\n\nShe eventually meandered down and said, 'Yeah, you felt that too, huh? The rocking horse started rocking when you ran.' And this, folks, is why I will not be going back there.\"\n\n\u2013kokaneeking\n\n22.\"Roughly 15 years ago, I was in upstate New York with my uncle at our family house. It's pretty quiet; not a lot of people are up there. My uncle and I were outside when it started to downpour, so we went inside. We were looking out the front door together, and my uncle commented on how hard it was raining. It's also pretty rural, so it was mostly pitch-black out, with only our front house light illuminating the area. We saw someone speed-walking on the road as we looked out the door. It was so dark, but their skin was so pale we could see their hands swaying as they walked and then their face as they turned towards our house. All I remember was the face had no eyes. My uncle quickly shut the door and said not to worry. It was probably someone who got stuck in the rain. I was scared, but he calmed me down. I was little, so I don't remember too much after that other than my uncle keeping watch for a while.\"\n\n\"I forgot about this story until years later, when I brought it up with my uncle because I thought maybe it was a dream. His attitude changed when I brought it up, and he just said he remembered but didn't want to talk about it. I have never brought it back up to him, and to this day, when I think about it, I feel really eerie.\"\n\n\u2013NyStiles1210\n\nDavid Wall / Getty Images\n\n23.And: \"When I was in second grade, I woke up one night and saw a glowing ball about the size of a volleyball floating out of my bedroom closet. It was pale green and hovered in the middle of the room. I remember pulling the covers over my head and being overwhelmed with this sense of fear/dread. I tried to yell out for my parents, but I was so terrified I could barely whisper. Years later (I was in my early 20s), we were at a family gathering, and somehow, the conversation turned to spooky things, and I told everyone at the table about the orb. My uncle (mom's brother) got this look on his face and said, 'You saw it too?!' He and my mom had lived in that house for a few years as kids (my grandfather owned it and sold it to my parents when they got married), and my old room had been his room. Apparently, the same exact thing had happened to him when he was roughly the same age.\"\n\n\u2013Colonial13\n\nHave you ever experienced something truly scary and unexplainable?

        "article_content": "At first glance, the cute, three-story home with the black shutters and wrought-iron fence looks like an American Dream.\n\nThen you realize: it\u2019s that house.\n\nThe five-bed, four-bath Dutch Colonial on Ocean Avenue in Amityville was the site of one of New York\u2019s most infamous mass murders, when a young man shot all six members of his family as they slept with a .35-caliber Marlin rifle, one by one.\n\nThe bloodshed wrought by Ronald DeFeo Jr. the morning of Nov. 13, 1974 was straight out of a horror movie, and eventually became one: the 1979 classic \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d starring Margot Kidder and James Brolin as a couple who buy and move into the empty house after the murders only to meet a demonic presence.\n\n5 Ronald Defeo Jr., seen here leaving court shortly after the killings, died years later at age 69. AP\n\nDeFeo, then 23, was a heavy drug user known as \u201cButch.\u201d Over the years he blamed everything from voices in his head, to hired killers, to his own sister, for the massacre.\n\nHe was sentenced to six terms of 25 years to life for killing his parents, Ronald and Louise; his two sisters, Dawn, 18, and Alison 13; and his two brothers, Marc, 12, and John, 9.\n\nHe was never paroled. In 2021, at the age of 69, he died in Albany Medical Center, close to the Sullivan Correctional Facility in upstate Fallsburg, where he was imprisoned. His cause of death was never made public.\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of DeFeo\u2019s macabre tour de force, the stain of the crime is something that little Amityville, pop. 9,500, just can\u2019t shake, try as it might.\n\nLaura DiDio was on an internship as a trainee reporter at the Long Island Press and got the exclusive story on a crime that stunned the village \u2014 and the world.\n\n\u201cNew York in the mid-1970s was no stranger to murder but Amityville certainly was,\u201d she told The Post.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this upscale, largely middle-class neighborhood and they hadn\u2019t had a murder in maybe 50 or 60 years. Local men had died fighting in the Korean War and Vietnam but there had never been anything like this.\u201d\n\nThe legend really took root about a year after the murders.\n\n5 Coroner office employees remove one of the bodies from the home. Bettmann Archive\n\nIn December 1975, during DeFeo\u2019s trial, the three-story home was purchased by newlyweds George and Kathy Lutz for $80,000. They moved from Brooklyn with Kathy\u2019s three children, Daniel, 9, Christopher, 7, and 5-year-old Melissa, known as \u201cMissy.\u201d\n\nSoon, the Lutzes claimed to have experienced a range of paranormal phenomena, including slime oozing from walls, sudden temperature drops and strange noises and odors.\n\nGeorge said he was waking at 3:15 a.m. each day \u2014 the same time DeFeo started his killing spree \u2013 while Kathy claimed to have levitated above her bed, according to a best-selling book based on the Lutzes\u2019 experience, 1977\u2019s \u201cThe Amityville Horror: A True Story.\u201d\n\n5 The family that moved in after the murders alleged that they experienced haunting and supernatural phenomena. AP\n\nThe kids all began sleeping on their stomachs, the same position DeFeo\u2019s victims were found in, while Missy claimed to have a new friend: a demonic pig called \u201cJodie.\u201d\n\nWhen a local Catholic priest, Father Ralph J. Pecoraro, arrived to bless the house, he fled, insisting he heard a voice telling him to \u201cGet out,\u201d George told reporters at the time.\n\nJust 28 days after they moved in, the Lutzes fled, their stay so short they didn\u2019t make a single payment on the $60,000 mortgage.\n\nStart your day with all you need to know Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.

In fact, Amityville is more like a cottage industry.\u201d\n\nAlexandra Holzer is a paranormal investigator and the daughter of Dr. Hans Holzer, the parapsychologist who examined the house in the wake of the events in the 1970s. He concluded that the house itself was not haunted but the land on which it was built probably was.\n\n5 The crime sparked a franchise that began with the film \u201cThe Amityville Horror.\u201d Everett Collection / Everett Collection\n\n\u201cMy father believed that DeFeo Jr. may have been possessed by an old American Indian chief and that unscrupulous property developers had built the house on a sacred Indian burial site,\u201d explains Holzer.\n\n\u201cHe thought that all the disturbances in that house stem from this little-known fact.\u201d\n\nIn the years since the murders, the book and the films, hordes of visitors, eager to see just what the fuss was all about, come to see what was dubbed, \u201cthe most haunted house in the world.\u201d\n\nThe crowds, whom DiDio said would sometimes sail up the creek to spy on the home from the rear, included another creepy visitor in 1984.\n\nRicky Kasso, a devil-worshipping, drug-taking teenager from Northport, Long Island, often visited the house. He butchered his 17-year-old friend Gary Lauwers, stabbing him over 30 times, in their hometown on June 19, 1984, only to hang himself before trial.\n\nSince the Amityville murders in 1974, the 3,600-square foot property on Ocean Avenue has changed hands many times, with one set of owners, Jim and Barbara Cromarty, even changing the address to throw off the curious.\n\nOther owners changed the house\u2019s distinct upper floor eye-windows \u2014 a signature of its spookiness \u2014 to square ones; fixed up the boathouse; added a sunroom; renovated the kitchen and finished the basement. None reported being haunted.\n\n5 Some neighbors put up Halloween decorations playfully referencing the \u201chorror.\u201d J.C. Rice\n\nIn 2000 The Amityville Record revisited the house, describing life on Ocean Avenue as \u201cfairly routine,\u201d apart from the \u201cregular visits by the curious and believers in the supernatural,\u201d adding that mostly \u201cit is just another house in Amityville with nothing more than a horrific history.\u201d\n\nLast week, when The Post visited the burg, some neighbors had even put up Halloween decorations playfully referencing the \u201chorror.\u201d\n\nThe property last sold for just $605,000 in 2017 but is now estimated to be worth $1,137,300, according to Zillow.\n\nThe current owners of the property declined to comment, as did the late Lutzes\u2019 surviving children, the mayor of Amityville, and the local church.\n\n\u201cTowns often like to bury these types of happenings \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 as it\u2019s not good for business,\u201d says Holzer.\n\nBut it never stays buried for long.\n\n\u201cYou will never be able to really quell that desire of interest because that is the very definition of our human nature,\u201d she added."

        "article_content": "Space never ceases to amaze us, but what the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) just found has changed everything that we know about the universe.\n\nThe JWST is an advanced version of the 1990 Hubble telescope, which was launched into space in December 2021.\n\nHowever, the JWST has made numerous discoveries in space, some of which could even point to there being life beyond our small planet.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt also found that potential planets could be forming right in front of us after discs and dust gathered around two stars.\n\nBut now, it\u2019s found something bigger.\n\nThe universe is vast (Getty Stock Images)\n\nWhile we\u2019re just a speck of dust in the cosmos, we\u2019ve been trying to figure out all that there is to know about the universe for quite some time.\n\nAdvert\n\nThat means we\u2019ve tried to date back to how old the universe is.\n\nFor years, cosmologists have believed the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old, but new JWST findings suggest that this may be incredibly inaccurate.\n\nNew research had found that the universe\u2019s age is probably more likely to be 26.7 billion years, which accounts for the JWST\u2019s observations.\n\nData from the 1990s' Hubble Space Telescope launch meant that originally, people thought it was between 7 billion to 20 billion years, and later agreed on 13.8 billion years.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt all began with the presence of 'impossible early galaxies'.\n\nThese galaxies emerged during the cosmic dawn, which occurred around 500 to 800 million years post-Big Bang, and really shouldn't have evolved disks so quickly.\n\nSo, surely they had been created earlier than we thought?\n\nThe JWST changed everything (Getty Stock Images)\n\nAdvert\n\nExplaining how the universe\u2019s age was challenged, Rajendra Gupta from the University of Ottawa told The Brighter Side: \"I attempted to marry the conventional big-bang model with the tired light theory, hoping to account for both supernovae and JWST data.\n\n\"While this expanded our universe's age to 19.3 billion years, it couldn\u2019t entirely account for the JWST data.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when he tried combining the tired light theory with an evolving model based on the coupling constants, which gave a lot better results. Still with us?\n\nThanks to this, the hybrid model accounted for the JWST's observations and also put the universe's age to 26.7 billion years.\n\nAdvert\n\nAlthough the Hubble Space Telescope had already guessed at the 'impossible early galaxy' issue, the JWST's launch in December 2021 strengthened these claims.\n\nNow, scientists have a clear picture of when the universe came to be, and this could help them in the future to recalculate the date of emerging planets, among other things.\n\nAs the universe continues to be a vast space of confusion for us to wrap our heads around, at least this one thing has been put to bed at last."

        "article_content": "In addition to innovation in the analytical methods and laboratory equipment used for HTS, significant advances have also occurred in the software arena, most notably the integration of AI and ML for data analysis and improvements in cloud-based platforms for collaborative research.\n\nIn addition to advances in automation, innovation in miniaturization technologies is helping to improve HTS performance. \u201cBy shrinking assay volumes, miniaturized platforms like microfluidics and nanodispensing have allowed for higher throughput while reducing reagent consumption,\u201d Mahale remarks. Access to smaller-volume assays, he says, is especially useful in fragment-based drug discovery and the screening of complex biological samples, as it allows for cost-effective experiments with even larger libraries.\n\nMore specifically, automation accelerates workflows by allowing researchers to complete multiple tasks at once. \u201cThis kind of parallelization is especially helpful for processes like catalyst screening, ligand screening, or solvent selection. Automation also allows chemists to conduct experiments in high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, which are difficult to complete manually. With these features, automation makes experimentation in the lab more targeted and efficient, saving valuable time, energy, and cost,\u201d Schmidt notes.\n\nBy automating process development tasks, researchers can significantly accelerate the identification of optimal synthetic pathways and fine-tune processes for maximum efficiency, according to Schmidt. \u201cThis translates to faster development times, reduced errors, and more consistent API production. For drug developers, this means reduced risk and uncertainty in API development, enabling a greater focus on clinical trials and regulatory approvals,\u201d he contends.\n\nAutomated liquid-handling robots, says Mahale, have become faster, more accurate, and capable of working with extremely low volumes of reagents, enabling more cost-effective screening. \u201cAdvances in pipetting precision, multi-plate handling, and integration with other systems (like incubators, centrifuges, and imagers) have significantly reduced human error and improved reproducibility. Automated workflows for complex cell assays and readouts based on imaging analysis, meanwhile, allow multiple assays to be performed with minimal consumable cost and keeping sustainability in mind. Use of multimode plate readers in the automation workflow also allows for multiplex assays to maximize data collection,\u201d he details.\n\nSome of the biggest advances improving and expanding HTS for drug discovery and development relate to automation and miniaturization of laboratory systems. \u201cAutomation is transforming the landscape of API development and manufacturing,\u201d Schmidt states.\n\nOverall, Alderwick summarizes, these various innovations have improved the scalability, specificity, and throughput of HTS, enabling researchers to screen more diverse compound libraries and discover novel molecular mechanisms of action.\n\nCRISPR-based functional screening, meanwhile, is employed to elucidate the biological pathways involved in disease processes, according to Alderwick. CRISPR editing of genes for knock-out and knock-in experiments have greatly advanced assay designs for cell-based phenotypic HTS approaches, he explains. In addition, by selectively tagging proteins of interest, CRISPR is advancing the understanding of target engagement and functional effects of drug treatments. \u201cBy screening small molecules alongside CRISPR-modified cells, researchers can better understand drug-target interactions at a genomic level, enabling the selection of candidates with higher precision,\u201d says Alderwick.\n\nASMS screening is increasingly used to discover small molecules that engage a specific target, says Alderwick. \u201cHighly advanced ASMS platforms that use rapid workflows to quickly generate high-quality data are getting traction as HTS methods. The platform is amenable to a broad spectrum of targets, including proteins, complexes, and oligonucleotides such as RNA, and can be a leading assay to initiate drug discovery programs,\u201d he comments. Unlike traditional label-free approaches, which are often slow, restrictive, and not optimal for large screening campaigns, Alderwick adds that new solutions such as Charles River\u2019s SAMDI ASMS platform allow efficient investigation of protein-protein interactions, TPD, molecular glues, RNA binders, etc. in a high-throughput format.\n\nOne of the key advances in HTS for drug discovery and development is the adoption of a wider array of state-of-the-art analytical techniques for this application. The most notable technologies introduced recently as high-throughput platforms include affinity selection mass spectrometry (ASMS)-based screening platforms such as self-assembled monolayer desorption ionization (SAMDI), target protein degradation (TPD), and molecular glue platforms; and CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based functional screening platforms, notes Luke Alderwick, senior group leader, Discovery Sciences with Charles River.\n\nOverall, using HTS during process development can, contends Schmidt, \u201chelp in the optimization and simplification of established workflows, integration of emerging technologies such as photochemistry and electrochemistry, and leveraging of rapidly evolving computational tools like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).\u201d\n\nDuring the early stages of candidate development, the synthetic pathway is still flexible, making HTS particularly valuable, according to Jens Schmidt, associate director of manufacturing, science, and technology at Lonza. \u201cHTS can help process development scientists rapidly evaluate the feasibility of different synthetic routes or optimal chemical combinations, such as solvents, catalysts, and bases,\u201d he explains. As the project advances through clinical phases, the flexibility in process steps decreases, but HTS remains useful for expanding the understanding of the process, such as its reaction kinetics.\n\n\u201cConsidering the vast number of technologies, each one of them serving a different purpose to address the scientific question, naturally different attributes, including binding affinities, reaction kinetics, enzymatic activity, functional activity, target engagement, selectivity, and specificity, are often analyzed. These attributes are critical because they provide early insights into the potential efficacy and selectivity of drug candidates, which is essential for optimizing pharmacological profiles,\u201d says Mahale. Given the wide range of technologies available, he also emphasizes the importance of selecting a fit-for-purpose technology to address each biological question.\n\nThe most widely used HTS technologies for identification of small-molecule API candidates include fluorescence-based, luminescence-based, and absorbance-based assays, according to Sachin Mahale, research leader, Discovery Sciences at Charles River. He adds that methods for detection of unlabeled biomolecules, such as those based on mass spectrometry, have also become more widely used at an HTS-scale in recent years, allowing the screening of compounds in both biochemical and cellular settings and thus expanding the breadth of targets to those that would otherwise be unscreenable. High-content imaging and automated electrophysiology are additional techniques providing multi-parametric cellular data that are becoming more widespread in high-throughput formats for discovery research, Mahale observes.\n\nHigh-throughput screening (HTS) enables the rapid testing of numerous compounds against biological targets. By automating and miniaturizing assays, HTS significantly accelerates the identification of potential drug candidates or optimal process conditions and can be applied throughout the entire development path of a potential drug, from discovery to process development. In the discovery phase, HTS is one of several hit-identification (Hit-ID) paradigms and involves the use of sensitive and miniaturized methods for screening large libraries of small molecules in a practical and efficient manner. During process development, HTS helps researchers rapidly establish an optimal synthetic route and conditions for each process step that reliably produce sufficient material quickly.\n\nNew AI algorithms can, observes Schmidt, analyze data from high-content screening systems, detecting complex patterns and trends that would otherwise be challenging for humans to identify. AI/ML algorithms can identify patterns and predict the activity of small-molecule candidates, even when the data are noisy or incomplete, Mahale adds. In addition to significantly speeding up the analysis of screening results and identifying promising leads faster and with higher accuracy, integration of AI into HTS processes can also improve assay optimization, he comments. Another key advantage of AI-driven HTS, according to Mahale, is its ability to adapt to new data in real time when compared to traditional HTS relying on pre-determined conditions.\n\n\u201cThese advances in AI and ML have been pivotal in accelerating drug discovery by improving both the quality of data and the efficiency of experimental processes. In the early stages of development, meanwhile, using these advanced solutions provides a holistic view that streamlines route scouting and accelerates the transition from research and development to robust manufacturing processes,\u201d Schmidt says. As an example, he points to Lonza\u2019s AI Route Scouting Service, which integrates proprietary commercial data with cutting-edge synthesis planning technology. \u201cThis innovation allows for more accurate and comprehensive analysis of cellular phenotypes, providing deeper insights into the efficacy and safety of drug candidates,\u201d he notes.\n\nCloud technology, meanwhile, has enhanced the ability to store, share, and analyze HTS data across multiple sites in real time, says Mahale. \u201cThe result is improved collaboration between research teams globally, reduced data redundancy, and increased application of machine learning models on large datasets,\u201d he explains.\n\nCombined, Mahale believes the various software innovations incorporated into HTS systems are enabling the handling of more complex datasets, improving prediction accuracy and streamlining the drug discovery pipeline.\n\nAddressing cost and complexity\n\nImplementing HTS for drug discovery and development is not a simple matter. The systems are both complex and costly. Fortunately, minimizing these issues has also been a focus of technology providers and end users.\n\nSchmidt points to significant advancements in standardization and simplification of workflows as helping to accelerate HTE experimentation timelines and reduce costs. Examples include the development of standardized protocols and data formats, which has simplified the implementation and operation of HTE assays, specifically improving their accessibility and accuracy. He also notes that software tools powered by AI have made it easier for researchers to design, execute, and analyze HTE experiments.\n\nAnother effective approach, according to Alderwick, is to leverage tailored compound libraries such as Charles River\u2019s Lead-Like Compound Library, which include compounds with lead-like properties and diversity and excludes problem chemotypes. The company\u2019s Fast-Track HTS offerings leverages this library to provide rapid hit discovery and lead identification while maintaining high-quality data outputs, he adds. \u201cWith a fixed-cost and streamlined program, this service is ideal for proof-of-concept studies and suits research groups or companies with limited funding because it allows for high-quality, early-stage screening without the need for extensive internal resources or infrastructure,\u201d Alderwick says.\n\nAlderwick also notes that modular systems in development offer the potential to customize HTS systems to the specific needs of a lab, which will further lower the initial capital investment required. \u201cAll of these advances are making HTS more cost-effective, scalable, and user-friendly, reducing barriers to entry for smaller research organizations,\u201d he concludes.\n\nFurther advances needed\n\nDespite the many remarkable advances made in HTS technologies for drug discovery and process development, significant challenges impacting both the efficiency of identifying optimal small-molecule candidates and processes, and their downstream success in clinical trials, remain.\n\nOne important issue, according to Schmidt, is the need to analyze large HTE datasets that require significant computational resources. \u201cThis can be a bottleneck for many drug developers, which is why partnering with a contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) like Lonza can be helpful. CDMOs have the tools and technology, such as AI algorithms, to help drug developers analyze data and progress through development stages quickly,\u201d he says.\n\nThere are also challenges to handling very small amounts of solids, Schmidt notes. \u201cAlthough this may seem like a minor technical detail, understanding and accepting these limitations is crucial,\u201d he says. One potential solution highlighted by Schmidt is the use of solid supports such as ChemBeads (MilliporeSigma), small, chemical-coated glass beads created specifically for use in HTS applications.\n\nA primary challenge in HTS for drug discovery is identifying assays that are physiologically relevant to the disease state despite the need for simplification to ensure scalability and robustness, according to Mahale. Model systems do not always translate well. In addition, biochemical assays, while simpler, often fail to capture the nuances of cellular contexts, such as the impact of membrane permeability, metabolite production, or protein-protein interactions, while cell-based assays are closer to physiological reality but are more complex, expensive, and challenging to miniaturize.\n\n\u201cThe complexity of human diseases, particularly multifactorial diseases like cancer or neurodegenerative disorders, makes it difficult to develop assays that can recapitulate the true pathophysiology of the disease,\u201d Alderwick observes. \u201cPoor assay choice,\u201d he continues, \u201cleads to the identification of hits that might show promise in early testing but later fail due to lack of efficacy or off-target effects in more complex disease models or clinical settings. The incorrect assay not only risks identifying false positives but also misses out on potential therapeutic candidates that could have better real-world efficacy. This limitation significantly contributes to the high attrition rates in drug development.\u201d\n\nAnother challenge is the development of a robust screening cascade (primary, secondary, and tertiary screenings) that helps to identify, confirm, validate, and refine viable candidates and reduce the attrition rate during later stages of drug development. Further assays are then employed during lead optimization to assess toxicity, selectivity, functional activity, bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics for further hit validation. \u201cFailures in designing an appropriate HTS cascade occur when these different stages are not sufficiently de-risked,\u201d contends Alderwick.\n\nWhile incorporating more predictive absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity screens early in the process has helped de-risk candidate selection to some degree, the challenge still lies in balancing the need for throughput and speed with the inclusion of more complex, multi-parametric data, according to Alderwick. \u201cEarly prediction of in vivo efficacy and safety in HTS remains a weak point, contributing to high failure rates in the transition from hit-to-lead and lead-to-clinical candidate stages,\u201d he concludes.\n\nFinally, Mahale notes that the selection of chemically diverse and high-quality libraries for HTS is pivotal in the success of small-molecule candidate identification, because even with the best assays, if the chemical library lacks diversity or contains unsuitable and non-drug-like compounds, the likelihood of finding optimal candidates diminishes. \u201cMany historical compound libraries are biased toward certain chemical scaffolds that have been repeatedly screened over decades, thus reducing the chances of discovering novel small molecules with new mechanisms of action,\u201d he observes. Charles River, Mahale adds, has tackled this issue by developing an expertly curated small-molecule compound library that covers a wide range of structural and functional diversity, thereby maximizing the probability of finding useful hits.\n\nEmerging strategies offer potential\n\nSeveral emerging strategies aim to improve the efficiency, reliability, and outcomes of HTS by leveraging advancements in technology, biology, and chemistry, according to Alderwick. Advances in organoid and 3D-cell culture technologies are helping to bridge the gap between simple in vitro assays and complex human disease biology, and thus address the need for more physiologically relevant assays, he observes. \u201cThese models better mimic the physiological conditions of tissues and organs, providing a more relevant system for screening potential drug candidates,\u201d Alderwick explains. Organoids derived from patient tissues, for example, can offer insights into how drugs might work in specific disease contexts, improving the predictive power of assays.\n\nTo shrink the gap between biochemical, cell-free assays and phenotypic, cell-based screens and thus better understand the on-target activity of identified hit molecules, including binding assays such as for target engagement and protein-protein interaction analysis in the HTS screening cascade, would greatly advance the ability to select optimal compounds for further development, believes Alderwick. He also notes that the use of advanced cellular models, such as CRISPR/Cas (CRISPR-associated protein) knockouts and induced pluripotent stem cells, for early screening is likely to improve HTS outcomes.\n\nContinued advances in automation and the use of AI and ML will further enable HTS platforms to handle more complex assays with higher precision, reproducibility, and throughput, according to Mahale. \u201cFully automated HTS systems can reduce human error, improve the consistency of assay conditions, and allow for more sophisticated workflows that balance throughput with data quality, while incorporation of AI/ML algorithms can reduce the rates of false readouts, making HTS more reliable and reducing the time spent following up on false positives,\u201d he says.\n\nUltimately, concludes Mahale, these emerging solutions aim to reduce the high attrition rates in drug discovery by improving the relevance and quality of the screening process, optimizing candidate selection, and expanding the chemical diversity available for exploration. \u201cWhile challenges remain, these developments promise to significantly enhance the utility of HTS in the drug development pipeline,\u201d he contends.\n\nExcitement around multi-omics approaches\n\nLooking beyond these strategies, Alderwick is excited about the trend toward integration of multi-omics approaches into HTS, which he says represent a major leap forward in the ability to identify optimal small-molecule API candidates. \u201cMulti-omics approaches leverage data from various molecular levels, including genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and even epigenomics, providing a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of how small molecules interact with entire biological networks and pathways rather than isolated targets,\u201d he explains. \u201cComplex diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndromes often involve multiple, interconnected biological systems, and thus multi-omics approaches have a greater likelihood of identifying effective new drug candidates,\u201d he states.\n\nPeople remain the key to success\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced drug manufacturing environment, HTS has become an indispensable tool. However, Schmidt emphasizes that advances in technology are not sufficient by themselves to enhance the performance of these platforms. \u201cLooking ahead, we can expect continued improvements in both reliability and simplicity, but the key to success lies in having a motivated, dedicated, and technically skilled team that is ready to embrace challenges and open to adopting innovative techniques,\u201d he insists.\n\nAbout the author\n\nCynthia A.

        "article_content": "Susie Wiles is known as one of the few people who can say \u2018no\u2019 to Donald Trump (REUTERS)\n\nNearly four years ago as Donald Trump was refusing to acknowledge his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked if his department was preparing to engage with the incoming Biden team.\n\nIn what appeared to be a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgement of the tensions around the then-president\u2019s lack of commitment to the peaceful transfer of power, he replied: \u201cThere will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, just hours after media outlets had declared Trump the winner in his bid to be the first president in over a century to serve non-consecutive terms, Pompeo took to X (formerly Twitter) to resurface the clip with an accompanying quip.\n\n\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAs I was saying\u2026 https://t.co/75XgmjqPXD \u2014 Mike Pompeo (@mikepompeo) November 6, 2024\n\nDays after Trump pulled off one of the most improbable comebacks in American political history by besting Vice President Kamala Harris in both the popular and electoral college vote counts, his transition planning appears to be in full swing \u2014 with some Trumpian twists.\n\nLate Wednesday evening, Trump transition chairs Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon issued a statement to reporters. In it, they said Trump would be \u201cselecting personnel to serve our nation under his leadership and enact policies that make the life of Americans affordable, safe, and secure\u201d in the coming weeks from \u201ca wide array of experts\u201d they\u2019ve assembled for his review.\n\nOne day later, Trump\u2019s transition team issued another press release announcing that the president-elect had made his first major staffing decision of his second term \u2014 the selection of longtime Republican operative and de facto 2024 campaign manager Susie Wiles to be his White House chief of staff.\n\nWiles will be the first woman to serve in the White House\u2019s top staff role, one that was largely thankless during Trump\u2019s first term. Over his four years in the White House from 2017 to 2021, Trump cycled through four chiefs of staff, with all but one exiting after trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to bring a semblance of order to the freewheeling style preferred by the ex-real estate mogul turned television star turned politician.\n\nHe is famous for encouraging, even relishing, internal conflicts and internecine warfare among his closest aides. It\u2019s said that he is as entertained by the infighting as viewers of The Apprentice were before he ended episodes by firing whoever lost the internal competition.\n\nBut Wiles, the daughter of legendary NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall and a renowned GOP power player in her own right, isn\u2019t one to embrace the drama. The campaign she ran along with veteran strategist Chris LaCivita was relatively drama-free and leak-averse compared with Trump\u2019s first two presidential efforts.\n\nOne Trumpworld veteran who spoke to The Independent on condition of anonymity said the pick is an indicator of the president-elect\u2019s respect for and trust in Wiles, who took over his political operation when he was in the veritable wilderness, reeling from the backlash to January 6th. The source described Wiles as a rare person who has the ability to say \u201cno\u201d to Donald Trump.\n\nThe Independent understands that Trump\u2019s selection of Wiles early on was meant to take some of the pressure off him from supporters and office-seekers who\u2019ve come calling in the days since his victory in hopes of bending his ear or securing roles in his new administration.\n\nIn theory, this means Wiles \u2014 not the president-elect \u2014 can be the point person for naming key staff roles and helping to roll out new appointment announcements.\n\nBut the transition team Trump has at his disposal isn\u2019t looking much like the one that ushered him into the White House in 2017. That was a chaotic effort compounded by his decision to replace voluminous plans assembled by then-New Jersey governor Chris Christie with a slapdash plan nominally headed up by Mike Pence. In actuality, it became a two-headed hydra of an operation with rival power bases in Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and then-incoming White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nIvanka Trump\u2019s husband Jared Kushner took a central role in the first Trump administration (REUTERS)\n\nBack then, Trump\u2019s transition team followed precedent and procedure by working with the General Services Administration, the government agency that by law provides incoming administrations with official office space and other resources, including what is needed for incoming administration officials to obtain security clearances and liaise with the myriad federal agencies they will have to staff and supervise at noon on January 20, 2025.\n\nBut this time, it appears the Trump team could eschew much of the official support in favor of a privatized model without precedent in modern history.\n\nThe initial statement released by transition chairs Lutnick and McMahon referenced \u201cthe next steps of Trump Vance 2025 Transition, Inc., a 501(c)(4) organization,\u201d indicating that the new-look Trump team wants to keep the federal government \u2014 including the civil servants that are tasked with assisting the transition \u2014 away from the people who will soon lead the federal government.\n\nTo start, a 501(c)(4) organization, named for the section of the Internal Revenue Code that authorizes such \u201csocial welfare\u201d organizations, aren\u2019t required to publicly disclose their donors. And by keeping the transition off of any official government email systems, the Trump team can evade having their emails requested by any Democratic or nonpartisan transparency groups under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAs of now, the Trump transition hasn\u2019t signed the memoranda of understanding that officially starts the transition process by letting the incoming team interface with the GSA and gain access to \u201coffice space, IT equipment, office supplies, fleet vehicles, mail management, and payment of compensation and other expenses\u201d available after an election is conceded.\n\nAlthough the agency notified the Trump team that it\u2019s eligible for government support on Wednesday, hours after Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the race to the president-elect, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that there\u2019s been no official acceptance of the offer. But she did say that Biden\u2019s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, has \u201creached out\u201d to the Trump team. She stressed that they would \u201cleave that line of communications open\u201d in hopes of facilitating \u201can effective, efficient transition of power.\u201d\n\nYet Trump allies are indicating that the transition may not be so smooth.\n\nReporting from The New York Times and other outlets has also indicated that Trump and his team are strongly considering skipping the process by which administration officials normally obtain security clearances after FBI background checks.\n\nInstead, Trump aides have reportedly argued for the president-elect to unilaterally grant clearances to top aides based on private background investigations done by a firm contracted by the transition.\n\nAlready, Trump-aligned groups such as Stephen Miller\u2019s America First Legal are publicly railing against the FBI and accusing it of illegally leaking information on presidential nominees to congressional staff. The group said in a press release that the Department of Justice-led process \u201chas been and will be weaponized against nominees in any future administration, including the Trump Administration.\u201d\n\nBecause security clearances are an executive function, the president can grant anyone a clearance at any level for any reason, even over the objections of the national security professionals who assess whether a given individual can be trusted with the nation\u2019s secrets. And as an elected official, Trump himself is exempt from clearance requirements despite his long and documented history of mishandling and allegedly unlawfully retaining national defense information.\n\nHe exercised this unilateral authority during his first term when he ordered his second chief of staff, John Kelly, to grant Kushner, then a White House senior adviser, a permanent \u201ctop secret\u201d security clearance after a months-long period during which the real estate scion was only allowed a much lower level \u201csecret\u201d one. Though Kushner had been allocated the \u201ctop secret\u201d credential on an interim basis early on in the first Trump administration, that temporary clearance was pulled and replaced with much lower \u201csecret\u201d clearance after national security officials and then-White House counsel Don McGahn raised concerns flagged by the US intelligence community about the president\u2019s son-in-law.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Kelly was so disturbed by the move that he authored a contemporaneous memorandum in which he wrote that he\u2019d been directly ordered to grant Kushner the clearance over the objections from both McGahn and the CIA.\n\nA former White House security adviser, Tricia Newbold, was similarly troubled by decisions around clearances in the early days of Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 so much so that she went to Congress with her concerns seeking whistleblower status. She told Democrats on the House Oversight Committee that numerous Trump appointees were denied clearances because of foreign influence concerns, conflicts of interest, financial issues, questionable conduct and even illicit drug use.\n\nIt\u2019s not fully clear what criteria the new Trump administration might use to grant access to sensitive information this time around if not those used by the FBI.\n\nUsually, appointees are screened for foreign ties, potential conflicts of interest, and susceptibility to blackmail. But given Trump\u2019s well-documented obsession with loyalty, it\u2019s very possible that fealty to the new administration \u2014 not the United States itself \u2014 could become an important metric.\n\nTo that end, Trump administration hopefuls are already flocking to his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida, where he and his team are making their plans, in hopes of kissing the ring and securing the new president\u2019s favor."

        "article_content": "Cybersecurity continues to command a lot of attention from enterprises looking for better protection from malicious hackers, and VCs want in on the action. In the latest example, TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Upwind \u2014 a specialist in assessing and securing cloud infrastructure \u2014 is closing in on a $100 million round at a valuation of between $850-$900 million, post-money.\n\nThe round includes a mix of new and existing investors such as Craft Ventures, Greylock, CyberStarts, Leaders Fund, Omri Casspi\u2019s Sheva Fund, and basketball star Steph Curry\u2019s investment fund Penny Jar. The round is in its final stages of getting closed \u2014 this could come in a matter of days \u2014 and could include further investors.\n\nThe round, a Series B, comes on the heels of the company picking up \u201cdozens\u201d of Fortune 500 companies and growing its staff to about 160 people, a source said.\n\nIt\u2019s a significant leap for Upwind, which had previously raised just over $77 million, including a $50 million round in September 2023. Upwind\u2019s last valuation, from that most recent round, was $300 million. It will be using some of the funding for R&D, and some for hiring, with plans to add around 100 people across Israel, San Francisco\u2026 and Iceland.\n\nUpwind was founded by Amiram Shachar, who sold his previous company, the cloud spend management startup Spot.io, to NetApp for $450 million. It is part of the guard of cybersecurity startups founded in Israel by teams that cut their teeth originally working in areas like military intelligence.\n\nIn its case, it is also one of the many companies in the space focusing on vulnerabilities in the cloud through a platform approach. Specifically, Upwind aims to tackle the blizzard of alerts that are typically raised by threat detection tools. It claims to reduce these alerts by 90% to focus security operations teams more closely on understanding and responding faster to actual threats.\n\nThe company\u2019s tech covers cloud services (covering areas like vulnerability management and identity security), workloads (which includes container security and detection and response) and apps (including areas like API vulnerability management). To some extent, these are all interrelated, one reason a platform approach makes sense.\n\nWe\u2019ll update this post as we learn more."

        "article_content": "When I bought the Razer Naga V2 Pro, I thought that I would instantly love it, and I thought that I knew what I was getting myself into. One month later, I can now say with full conviction that I was wrong on both accounts.\n\nDespite being two years old, many still rank the Razer Naga V2 Pro among the best gaming mice, and having tested it myself, I fully agree. But make no mistake: It\u2019s definitely a mouse with a learning curve, and I learned that the hard way.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMy first rodeo\n\nI realize that I\u2019m pretty late on the Razer Naga train. The concept of Razer\u2019s 12-button mouse is nothing new at this point, and various iterations of the mouse have been around since 2009. I\u2019ve never owned one until just over a month ago, though.\n\nThe Razer Naga is primarily an MMO mouse, and 2009 was a prime year for such players; I, myself, was deep into my World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King phase at that time. I sure could\u2019ve used a Naga, but there was always something that kept me away from giving it a try, such as it being expensive (I paid $160 for mine, but the recommended list price is $180) or the fact that all those buttons made it downright intimidating.\n\nThis makes the Razer Naga V2 Pro my first attempt at using Razer\u2019s MMO mouse. It\u2019s not my first Razer mouse, but it\u2019s the first gaming mouse where I truly felt like I was trying something new. As a result, a lot of my impressions of the mouse aren\u2019t strictly related to the V2 Pro as much as the Razer Naga overall, but I\u2019ll cover parts that are unique to this mouse, too.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack. Although the Razer Naga V2 Pro is plug-and-play, it\u2019s also anything but.\n\nNot a love at first sight\n\nI was excited to get the Razer Naga V2 Pro, but my initial excitement was short-lived. There were some things that I didn\u2019t love from the get-go. The good news is that adapting to the mouse helped me get past most of them.\n\nBefore I dive in, let\u2019s go over the basic specs.\n\nRazer Naga V2 Pro Sensitivity 30,000 DPI Polling rates 125/500/1,000Hz IPS 750 Max acceleration 70g Connectivity 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, USB-C Battery Up to 150 hours (2.4GHz)/Up to 300 hours (Bluetooth) Programmable buttons 10/14/20, depending on side plate Weight 134g Recommended price (at launch) $180\n\nThe Razer Naga V2 Pro is a high-end wireless mouse, and the specs show it. It comes with three hot-swappable side plates: one with the standard two thumb buttons, one with six, and one with 12. This amounts to up to 20 programmable buttons, and the V2 Pro adds the HyperScroll Pro scroll wheel, which comes with six presets and a custom mode. You can effectively double the number of programmable inputs because of Razer\u2019s Hypershift tech, which I\u2019ll go into a bit later.\n\nThe mouse comes with its own 2.4GHz wireless dongle, and once you plug it in, you\u2019re good to go. You need the Razer Synapse software to set it up, which I\u2019ve already had due to owning a Razer keyboard; I\u2019m guessing you\u2019d be prompted to download it otherwise.\n\nMy first thoughts as I held the mouse were that it was really heavy and that my hand was slightly too small. (I knew that it\u2019s not exactly perfect for small hands and bought it despite that.) Despite the weight and the size, the mouse felt comfortable for the most part, although the sheer number of buttons underneath my thumb took some effort getting used to. I use a palm grip and found the mouse to be perfectly suited to that grip type, although with bigger hands, I think a claw grip would work just as well.\n\nI have to give it to Razer \u2014 the hot-swappable side plates are extremely easy to swap back and forth. Truthfully, I\u2019ve had more problems unplugging the mouse from its charging cable than I\u2019ve had swapping out the 12-button plate for the two-button version. In fact, I found the charging cable a little difficult to unplug.\n\nDespite the ease of use, I had some buyer\u2019s remorse. I didn\u2019t love this mouse at first sight. It was heavier than I expected, it was bulky, and it quickly dawned on me that setting up the keybinds would be a project instead of a quick five-minute job.\n\nThe different stages of using a Naga\n\nI feel like one of the things that people don\u2019t mention much in reviews of this mouse (of which I\u2019ve read plenty) is that it doesn\u2019t just take a long time to set up but also to learn. I want to touch on that aspect, because that\u2019s probably what\u2019s taken me the longest time to adapt to. Again, this is more of a Naga thing than the Razer Naga V2 Pro, but if you\u2019re a first-time user, you might run into the same obstacles that I\u2019ve encountered.\n\nGetting started is easy, but only on paper. I dove right in with the 12-button version, naively thinking I\u2019d be a pro gamer within an hour. (Spoiler alert: I was decidedly not a pro gamer within an hour.)\n\nWithout a lot of tweaking in Synapse, those thumb buttons don\u2019t do anything, so I set out to bind them to certain keyboard keys, which, in turn, made them usable in games. Most games don\u2019t recognize these side panel keys, so this keyboard-to-mouse transition is necessary.\n\nI entertained the idea of using HyperShift, but honestly, I think I\u2019m too casual a gamer to bother.\n\nA process that I thought would take me five minutes ended up taking the better part of an hour as I changed certain binds back and forth. I can\u2019t complain about the actual software \u2014 it\u2019s easy enough to navigate. No one tells you how hard it\u2019s going to be to pick the right stuff to bind, though.\n\nThe side panel accounts for 12 separate keybinds, and you can double the number of programmable inputs on the Naga V2 Pro thanks to Razer\u2019s HyperShift tech. This lets you assign a secondary function to each button, and when holding down the HyperShift key, the keybind changes accordingly.\n\nI entertained the idea of using HyperShift, but honestly, I think I\u2019m too casual a gamer to bother. The games I primarily play don\u2019t require a whopping 24 different binds on top of the stuff I\u2019m already very used to using on my keyboard. Picking the right things to re-map was a process. I had a lot of binds that I was comfortable with using during gameplay, and a lot of those I simply didn\u2019t want to swap out.\n\nOnce I was done, the reality check fully set in.\n\nA never-ending process\n\nThis mouse has been out for nearly two years now, so I won\u2019t bore you with the details that are available in nearly every review of it. Instead, I want to look at the practical side of using such a mouse as your daily driver.\n\nMy main MMO is still World of Warcraft. (Yes, I know, time to find a new game.) Much like most MMOs, WoW gives you different spells and therefore different keybinds for each character. The binds themselves are uniform across every character, but as each comes with its own abilities, you need to figure out a way to streamline these binds and memorize them.\n\nUsing the 12-button side panel really shook things up for me. At first, I found myself reverting to what I already remembered, meaning using the keyboard instead of trying to use the mouse. This was especially hard to avoid during intense gameplay, where using the wrong ability can be deadly.\n\nEven when I forced myself to stick to the mouse, it took me a while to learn the button placement. Fortunately, Razer must have put a fair bit of thought into each, because once you\u2019ve used the mouse for a couple of days, the button shape becomes distinct enough that it gets a lot easier to tell them apart without looking.\n\nBut that first day or two? Not only did I not remember which button was assigned to which spell but I also had to stop and think which button I was even pressing.\n\nI eventually got used to the button layout, but honestly, I rarely make use of all 12 buttons. I could, but I hardly ever need to. I can\u2019t imagine doubling them with HyperShift \u2014 I think I\u2019d spend most of my time being confused as to what I\u2019m doing as opposed to actually playing.\n\nIt was an uphill climb, but one month later, I\u2019m feeling the real benefit of using this mouse. Gameplay becomes more intuitive; casting spells is so much quicker; you free up more of your keyboard for other things. I\u2019m not sure if it made me a better gamer, but it certainly made gameplay more enjoyable for me.\n\nThe only downside? Adjusting this mouse to your needs is a never-ending process. Sure, I\u2019ve mastered it for one character, but playing a different character or a different game means starting all over again and memorizing even more binds. This is true for any game, but with the sheer number of programmable buttons that the Razer Naga V2 Pro offers, it does feel like a chore if you play a lot of different titles.\n\nThe good part of it is that even if you don\u2019t end up using all 12 buttons and stick to the basic or the six-button side panel, the Naga V2 Pro is a superb mouse regardless, so you won\u2019t be missing out. I could see it being less great for first-person shooters, though, if only because of the weight.\n\nThe best (and most frustrating) mouse I\u2019ve ever owned\n\nThere\u2019s so much that I love about the Razer Naga V2 Pro: the sky-high DPI; the excellent sensor; the seamless wireless connectivity; the high-end build quality that tells me that it might last me a long time (which is quite a feat, as I break mice in record time).\n\nA month later, I also love the side panels. I\u2019ve gotten so used to the 12-button version that I hardly ever bother to scale down to two as it doesn\u2019t bug me when I work. The six-button panel is the one that\u2019s gotten the least love, simply because I\u2019ve gotten used to the maximum layout and I think that introducing any changes at this point would only end in frustration.\n\nAnother thing that put me off at first but is now a favorite is the customizable scroll wheel. Out of the box, using the scroll wheel feels like pulling teeth, but a quick adjustment in Synapse turns it into the smoothest scroll wheel I\u2019ve ever tried. There are so many modes that there\u2019s something in there for everyone, and if the presets don\u2019t work for you, you can always create your own profile. Personally, as I don\u2019t use the scroll wheel much during gameplay, I haven\u2019t had to make any tweaks after that initial adjustment.\n\nThe battery life is another thing I\u2019ve enjoyed and can applaud this mouse for. Prior to this mouse, I briefly used a battery-powered Logitech, and swapping those AA batteries every week or so was tedious \u2014 not to mention expensive. The battery on the Naga V2 Pro is excellent, lasting for days on end if you turn off the RGB lighting. Turning that on makes it deplete a lot faster, though.\n\nOutside of those more Naga-specific things, this is just a really solid mouse. It\u2019s quick, reliable, and super customizable.\n\nIt\u2019s also entirely overkill for my needs, and honestly, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to non-MMO gamers. If you don\u2019t regularly play games with lots of different binds, you don\u2019t need this mouse. Even if you do (like I do), it\u2019s still overkill for many people and it has a steep learning curve that never really ends.\n\nWith all that said, I\u2019d buy the Razer Naga V2 Pro again without any hesitation, and I\u2019d happily go through the tedious process of learning my binds all over again. I\u2019m officially a convert."

        "article_content": "Your retail store design should leverage every resource you have, from image marketing to emphasizing the quality of your products, to bring about a sale. If you look at the top trends in retail store design, they predominantly revolve around making a sale. They focus on creating an undeniable customer experience that supports every customer walking to the front with products in tow to buy something.\n\nAfter you have traffic in-store, your job is not done until they have made a purchase. Based on present trends, here is how you can apply a sales-oriented mindset to your retail store design.\n\nMinimalist Design\n\nMinimalism uses clean lines and neutral colours to facilitate uncluttered, simple spaces. It keeps the focus on the products. Minimalism is a major trend in retail store design, offering a sophisticated feel with no sensory overload.\n\nBiophilic Design\n\n\u2018Biophilic\u2019 refers to plants, natural light, and organic materials. It brings the outside in. Biophilic elements have been shown to enhance customer satisfaction and encourage longer visits.\n\nIntegrate Digital\n\nMore retail store designs are embracing integrating digital with the in-store experience. This features click-and-collect areas, QR codes, and mobile app compatibility. This omnichannel experience is becoming the norm for more retail brands.\n\nSmart Technology in Retail\n\nRetail is upgrading to smarter tech and AI-driven software. Interactive digital signage software is perhaps the most diverse tech in retail. There are also digital price tags, AI-powered customer service, real-time data monitoring, and streamlined checkouts.\n\nTap Into Retail Software\n\nAdvanced retail software can display information about customers you may not otherwise know. Retail software is also trained to identify recommended add-on purchases, cross-selling and upselling opportunities, and more. Use this data to shift your retail store layout.\n\nWindow Displays\n\nWindow displays are your walk-by or drive-by advertisement to passersby. They\u2019re an opportunity to display your best-sellers and the merchandise that best represents your brand.\n\nInteraction with Products\n\nFocus on ways your retail store design can facilitate interactions with a product. This may include a free sample, a free tryout, a how-to demonstration, or creating a merchandise display where there\u2019s interaction.\n\nAny items you have on sale or that are your best-sellers should be placed at the center of the store. Do not make these products hard to find. When they are at the center of the store, no customer will have to ask where to find them.\n\nHighlight Your Loyalty Program\n\nLoyalty programs appreciate the customer and elevate sales. Make yours packed with benefits and perks. Emphasize your loyalty program on signage in-store, ensuring that customers opt-in.\n\nHost an Experience\n\nDesign, d\u00e9cor, layout, and planning can make any retail store experiential. An experience can make your store stand out. Use the right d\u00e9cor. Host an event. Make your retail store an experience that customers will remember.\n\nEco-Friendly Sustainability\n\nYour store design should highlight some element of sustainability, be it the use of sustainable materials in product packaging or energy-efficient lighting and eco-friendly products on the line. Many shoppers want to know about sustainability efforts and want you to demonstrate a welcoming, eco-friendly store.\n\nCreative Displays\n\nUnique merchandise displays highlight what products you have in stock and what products are worth buying. They can emphasize new products and best-sellers and elevate your in-store visual merchandise game.\n\nModular Layouts\n\nMore companies are opting for flexible layouts, especially for smaller retail stores. They enjoy being able to reconfigure a store based on the season. Modular displays and movable shelving mean the shopping experience can be fresh year-round.\n\nOpen, Airy Layouts\n\nMinimal inventory on the floor and an open, uncluttered layout can allow customers to move freely. It reduces congestion, making shoppers feel more comfortable and less stressed in-store.\n\nPoint-of-Purchase Displays\n\nPoint-of-purchase displays near the register allow customers to buy complementary products and add-ons. For last-minute impulse purchases, go here. Here, you can inch every sale up by a few dollars.\n\nEmbracing Industrial Elements\n\nA store fortunate enough to have exposed brick, metal beams, and raw concrete in its building shouldn\u2019t ignore these industrial-chic elements. They appeal to many shoppers and offer a rugged style that conveys authenticity.\n\nMaximize Natural Light\n\nLarge windows and skylights should increase natural light and reduce the need for cold, artificial light. Natural light gives your store a more eco-conscious image while creating an inviting atmosphere that is hard to achieve with artificial light.\n\nSpecial In-Store Deals\n\nUse digital signage software to highlight special deals, such as a buy-one-get-one offer or 50% off select items. Openly advertise your best in-store deals to increase the likelihood of a customer buying more.\n\nLocal Art and Culture\n\nFeature local artwork in-store to foster a sense of authentic community. Localized design elements connect your brand to its surroundings and can give a retail store a unique feel."
