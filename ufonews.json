        "article_content": "Brits can see where UFOs have been spotted across the country during the past four years on a map - showing nearly 2,000 extra-terrestrial sightings.\n\nIt has been an intriguing time for UFO enthusiasts around the world with an American fighter jet shooting down an unexplained flying object that was later identified as a Chinese balloon last year. It was suspected of being on a spying mission along with three other objects in or near American airspace.\n\nAnd then whistle-blower Major David Grusch, a former Air Force intelligence officer, set the internet on fire when he claimed the US was concealing a long-standing programme that retrieves and reverse-engineers unidentified flying objects. The intrigue has continued into 2024, with Ukrainian troops recording a huge disc-shaped object over the battlefield of Donetsk, while closer to home a hiker came upon a mysterious monolith on a hilltop in Powys, Wales.\n\nHe initially assumed was \u201csome sort of UFO\u201d, and has since left some speculating it may have been planted by aliens. But despite increasing speculation about alien visitors online the skies above the UK have been relatively quiet in the past year and we are no closer to finding out if we are not alone in the universe.\n\nIn its annual report, the research group UFO Identified documented 395 sightings in the UK in 2023 - a 20% drop from 497 sightings in 2022 and lower than in 2021 (413) and 2020 (484). That adds up to 1,789 sightings in four years. Information was taken from social media, newspaper reports, and over 50 Freedom of Information requests, as well as from reports made directly to UFO spotter groups around the UK.\n\nAccording to the report, people in the North West had the best chance of seeing a UFO last year, with 41 sightings across the region, followed by the South East (40) and then the South West (39). That is broadly similar to the location of sightings in 2022 and 2021. Over the four years UFO Identified has documented the phenomenon, the highest number of sightings have been seen in the South East (233), followed by the North West (218) and then the South West (193). The lowest number of sightings have been reported in Northern Ireland (30), and the North East of England (63).\n\nWhile flying saucers and other unexplained phenomena were most likely to be spotted in the North West or the South East, the data shows that the best time to see a UFO last year was on a Monday evening between 9pm and 10pm. The most common sighting was a \u201cstar-like\u201d UFO, followed by an orb - with several different witnesses reporting clusters of orbs in the skies across different locations.\n\nThe vast majority of sightings were of far-off objects in the sky, but there were 27 \u201cClose Encounters of the First Kind\u201d, more than double the previous year. These are reports of UFOs seen up close, at a distance of no more than 500 feet away. There were also two \u201cClose Encounters of the Second Kind\u201d which is when a UFO sighting appears to cause a physical effect, such as a car malfunction, a ground impression, or a reaction in animals.\n\nSightings documented last year include:"

        "article_content": "AI can assist everywhere from your email apps to fast food outlets. Now Amazon is keen to be involved in the AI revolution with an AI bot called Rufus, which can answer questions, research products, and help you make the right buying decisions across Amazon.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re stuck for a gift idea for someone special in your life, or you need to compare two products against each other. From asking about your active orders to checking up on the details of something you\u2019re thinking about buying, Rufus can help\u2014and here\u2019s how you can find it.\n\nHow Rufus works, and where to find it\n\nRufus might offer prompt suggestions based on your browsing history. Screenshot: Amazon\n\nIf you\u2019re familiar with AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Gemini, Rufus is very much along the same lines. It\u2019s trained on \u201cAmazon\u2019s extensive product catalog, customer reviews, community Q&As, and information from across the web\u201d, which it then sifts through, connects together, and summarizes to respond to your questions.\n\nThese bots, however, don\u2019t just copy and paste information\u2014they\u2019re designed to generate fresh and original responses, so (as always with these AI models) mistakes can be made. Amazon says Rufus \u201cmay not always get things right,\u201d so it\u2019s worth double-checking important details\u2014don\u2019t assume everything Rufus sells is 100 percent correct, and don\u2019t share private or personal information with it.\n\nIf you\u2019re using the Amazon Shopping app for Android or iOS, you\u2019ll find Rufus on the right of the navigation bar at the bottom (the Rufus logo is two blobs with a star next to them): Tap the button to bring up a chat window and start asking questions. If you\u2019re shopping through the Amazon website, you\u2019ll see the Rufus button up on the left-hand side of the toolbar at the top.\n\nStraight away, Rufus will make suggestions about questions to ask\u2014some of these may be related to recent searches or recent purchases. Click or tap on any of the suggestions, or enter your own question or prompt, and Rufus springs into action.\n\nAfter each response, you get the opportunity to ask follow-up questions (Rufus will remember the conversation history), and rate the responses you\u2019ve been given (via the thumbs up or thumbs down buttons). You can clear your chat history in Rufus, but only in the app, and not on the web: Tap on the three dots (top right), then choose Manage chat and Clear chat history.\n\nQuestions and prompts to try with Rufus\n\nOne of the ways to use the bot is to ask questions about products. Screenshot: Amazon\n\nRufus knows what you\u2019re looking at on the Amazon platform, so you can ask it questions about a product you\u2019ve got up on screen. You can ask how much an item weighs, for example, or which materials it\u2019s made of, or what the battery life is like. In some cases, the bot will make direct reference to something in the listing.\n\nGoing beyond individual product pages, Rufus can answer shopping questions more generally. You might want to ask what the best tool is for a particular job, or how two specific items compare to each other, or what a certain item actually does (and how). You can ask about trends in product categories as well\u2014and see what\u2019s proving popular with other shoppers, for instance.\n\nYou can get quite creative with these questions. For example, you\u2019re able to ask about the tools and materials needed to make a garden shed, or about presents that would be suitable for a 5-year-old child\u2019s birthday, or about extras you might need for a dinner party. Any kind of advice you need, Rufus will attempt to give you some pointers.\n\nThis is where Rufus becomes more like other generative AI chatbots out there: If you\u2019re stuck for shopping inspiration, or you\u2019re not sure how two types of TV tech compare, then you can get answers. The questions you ask don\u2019t have to be specifically about what\u2019s being sold on Amazon, though you are quite likely to see links to see some related items on the site anyway.\n\nFinally, you can also chat with Rufus about the status of your current orders, or the last time you ordered (for example) packing tape. Sometimes you\u2019ll get a direct answer, and sometimes you\u2019ll be given a link for a relevant page on the Amazon site to follow. And if you\u2019re wondering how Amazon came up with the name, by the way, then it\u2019s to do with one of Amazon\u2019s earliest employees."

        "article_content": "Illustration: Tang Tengfei/Global Times\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a cutting-edge technology that the world's scientific and technological powers compete to develop. In the military field, the development of \"AI-powered autonomous weapons\" has become the focus of technology applications. Currently, the \"revolving door\" phenomenon produced by US politics has appeared in the technological, political and military realms.It is obvious that the US has recently been stepping up the promotion of AI technology in the military and intelligence field. US President Joe Biden signed a memorandum on Thursday, instructing national security agencies to accelerate the adoption and integration of AI systems. As some US media reports commented, this shows that the US military and intelligence agencies are required to \"more quickly embrace and deploy artificial intelligence as a matter of national security.\"The world's concern about the security and humanitarian risks behind such a move from the US has grown stronger. For emerging technologies that still face imperfections in regulation and governance, the promotion of their weaponization needs to be built on a complete risk-control system. Otherwise, its unpredictability and uncontrollability will pose a major threat to global peace and security. The US' unilateralist concept of security has jeopardized the security interests of other countries and exacerbated the arms race in the field of AI military applications, to a certain extent, while hindering the process of AI security governance. There are certain differences in the positions, attitudes and views of countries participating in AI security governance, and the future of the governance of AI military applications remains uncertain.International cooperation is especially needed in the field of AI security governance, and the common wisdom of mankind should become a \"creator\" of human happiness, not a \"stumbling block\" to security and stability. We should strengthen common security in the field of AI and fully support the UN in playing its role as the main channel of global scientific and technological governance. We also need to appropriately respond to all kinds of AI security issues and challenges, ensuring that AI is always under human control.In order to truly promote the effective governance of technology, it is necessary to abandon the zero-sum mentality. Adhering to the principle of indivisibility of security, we resolutely oppose prioritizing the security of one country over the insecurity of others. Only by effectively respecting and safeguarding the legitimate security concerns of each country, and group, can we truly safeguard the common security interests of the majority of the global community from infringement.To promote safe collaboration in the field of AI, it is essential to encourage broader participation from various stakeholders. Countries around the world are facing similar security threats in an increasingly uncertain and unstable environment, and thus should become active \"participants\" of security governance. Ensuring that global issues are addressed by all countries and that global rules are established collectively is crucial for achieving more open and inclusive governance in the technological realm.The development and application of AI across various fields, especially in the military domain, are significantly affecting the global security environment. However, the specific forms, means and consequences of these impacts remain uncertain, and how new security risks evolve is yet to be observed. Therefore, it is vital for the international community to jointly explore safe development paths for military AI.Recent international practices have shown that achieving collaborative security governance is not an easy task. With respect to military AI, on the one hand, certain countries have severe tendencies toward pan-securitization and unilateralism, continuously constructing technological barriers and digital divides. The technological competition and \"cold war\" in science and technology are becoming realities. On the other hand, the dual-use nature of AI, to some extent, increases the costs of trust between nations and raises the threshold for global cooperative governance. To this end, the international community needs to actively seek cooperation paths.The author is a scholar at the CPC Theory Innovation Research Center of the Armed Police Force. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn"

Blue Bell Hill in Kent\n\nOne such haunted highway is Blue Bell Hill in Kent, notorious for numerous sightings of phantasmal figures, particularly the ghost of Judith Langham, a young bride tragically killed on her wedding day 19 November 1965 at the tender age of 22.\n\nReports suggest that a spectral figure in a white dress haunts the road, startling drivers who believe they've hit her. However, when they exit their vehicles to offer assistance, she vanishes into thin air.\n\n2. Stockbridge Bypass, Sheffield.\n\nIn 1988, a new thoroughfare was constructed across the Peak District, linking the M1 with the Woodhead Pass and the A1616. As soon as construction began, tales of strange happenings started to emerge, earning the road a reputation for paranormal activity.\n\nDuring the construction phase, it's said that two security guards spotted children playing on the site. As they approached, the youngsters vanished without leaving any footprints behind.\n\n3. M6 motorway\n\nThis route has been in use for nearly two millennia, dating back to the Roman occupation of England in 55 BC. It's therefore not surprising that the M6 has its fair share of ghostly sightings.\n\nMotorists travelling on the M6 have reported witnessing unusual phenomena, such as Roman soldiers marching across the carriageway. Some claim to have seen a pair of eyes peering at them from behind the bushes.\n\n4. The B519 by The Spaniard's Inn, Hampstead.\n\nA sharp bend in the B519 near The Spaniard's Inn in Hampstead is reputedly haunted by an eighteenth-century highwayman.\n\nThe spectre's father is said to have once owned the pub, and his phantom son continues to haunt the road, targeting unsuspecting motorists.\n\n5. A666, 'The Devil's Highway', Bolton.\n\nIt seems fitting that a road named after The Number of the Beast would be haunted. The A666 has been the site of numerous accidents caused by sightings of a stooped figure limping along the roadside.\n\nKnown as the A666 ghost, dashcam footage from 2015 captured a white apparition appearing out of nowhere on the deserted road. The video shows the figure slowly advancing towards a terrified driver while the passenger screams for help.\n\n6. The Old Tay Bridge, Dundee.\n\nIn the winter of 1879, a violent storm caused the Old Tay Bridge to collapse while a train was crossing it. The six-carriage train plunged into the icy waters of the Tay, tragically killing all 75 passengers on board.\n\nAccording to local folklore, each year on the anniversary of the disaster, a ghostly train can be seen crossing the old bridge, accompanied by the chilling screams of the victims.\n\n7. Platt Lane, Lancashire.\n\nThis Westhoughton road runs near the site of the 1910 Pretoria pit tragedy, which claimed the lives of 344 miners. Numerous motorists have reported seeing eerie eyes peering out from the hedges at the roadside, and spectral miners trudging alongside cars or hauling coal wagons behind them.\n\n8. The A636, Wiltshire.\n\nA notorious stretch of the A636, ominously known as 'Sally in the Woods', is believed to be haunted by the spirit of a young girl who tragically lost her life after being struck by a vehicle. Numerous sightings have been reported by motorists, and an alarming number of fatal accidents - seven to be exact - have occurred without any logical explanation, leading many to suspect paranormal involvement.\n\n9. The B1249, Yorkshire.\n\nThe B1249 between Driffield and Staxton Hill in East Riding of Yorkshire has its own eerie history. Wolves once roamed these lands until they were hunted to extinction in the 15th century.\n\nHowever, reports of werewolf sightings persist. In the 1960s, author Charles Christian recounted a chilling tale of a lorry driver who was left petrified when a red-eyed, hairy creature attempted to break through his windscreen on this isolated road.\n\nMore recently, in August 2016, a young woman claimed to have seen a monstrous creature \"like a big dog, probably bigger than my car, but it had a human face\" in the nearby village of Halsham.\n\n10. A3, Surrey.\n\nThe A3 near Burpham in Surrey has its own spectral tale. In December 2002, Surrey Police responded to reports of a car swerving off the road.\n\nUpon investigation, they discovered a car in a ditch with the remains of a driver who had died five months prior. This led to speculation that the sighting may have been a ghostly re-enactment of the fatal crash.\n\n11. Cock Lane, near the Old Bailey in London.\n\nMotorists may not encounter anything unusual on the road itself, but one of the houses is reportedly haunted by the spirits of two women who passed away there in the 1760s. It's said that eerie sounds and screams can still be heard as you drive past.\n\n12. Electric Brae, Aryshire, Scotland.\n\nWhile there haven't been any ghost sightings as such, this road has long been a source of intrigue due to a different kind of paranormal activity. Despite seeming to go uphill, a vehicle left in neutral will slowly start to move.\n\nFor years, it was thought that a mysterious magnetic force or a witch's curse was at work. In reality, the Electric Brae is a 'gravity hill', where the perceived uphill slope is just an optical illusion.\n\nNonetheless, it remains a favourite among drivers keen to experience the phenomenon for themselves."

In short Scientists have discovered a group of neurons in the brainstem that could be the control center for REM sleep, a stage often disrupted in sleep disorders.\n\nBy manipulating these neurons, they were able to alter sleep patterns in mice, suggesting potential new treatments for conditions like sleep apnea and narcolepsy.\n\nThis breakthrough could pave the way for better understanding and treatment of sleep disorders. Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nThe discovery was made through experiments on mice\n\nBreakthrough discovery could lead to new treatments for sleep disorders\n\nBy Akash Pandey 04:58 pm Oct 27, 202404:58 pm\n\nWhat's the story In a major breakthrough in sleep research, a team of scientists has identified the neural control center for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The discovery, made through experiments on mice, saw researchers inducing REM sleep by stimulating a specific circuit at the top of the brainstem. The findings could potentially deepen our understanding of human sleep biology and its disorders.\n\nTherapeutic implications\n\nPotential applications in treating sleep disorders\n\nThe team's findings could have major implications in treating sleep disorders like sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and REM disorders. These conditions often involve distressing nightmares or physical manifestations of dreams through movement or vocalizations. The newfound knowledge about the brain's control center for REM sleep, could potentially be used to manipulate this stage of sleep in patients suffering from these disorders.\n\nResearch challenges\n\nUnraveling the mysteries of REM sleep\n\nThe precise location and role of the brain's REM sleep control center have long been debated among scientists. Some researchers have proposed that neurons in the mammalian brainstem are key to triggering REM sleep. This theory stems from observations in cats, where removal or damage to the brainstem prevents proper REM sleep and leads to dream enactment behaviors.\n\nNeurological insights\n\nBrainstem's role in REM sleep and related disorders\n\nSimilar dream enactment behaviors have been seen in humans with known brainstem degeneration (like in Parkinson's disease). This further supports the theory of the brainstem's role in REM sleep. The pons, at the top of the brainstem, has been identified as a potential 'control center' for muscle relaxation during REM sleep through rodent studies. However, identifying specific pathways responsible for this crucial phase has proved challenging due to intermingling neurons promoting wakefulness and sleep.\n\nNeuronal discovery\n\nDiscovery of REM-related neurons in the brainstem\n\nNeuroscientist Mitsuaki Kashiwagi and his team have pinpointed a cluster of REM-related neurons in the dorsal region of the pons. These neurons, called Crhbp+ neurons due to their expression of a corticotropin-releasing hormone-binding protein, project from the pons to Nos1+ neurons in the medulla oblongata. This loop could potentially act as a core circuit for REM sleep, Kashiwagi and his colleagues said.\n\nExperimental results\n\nManipulation of pons neurons affects REM sleep\n\nThe team's experiments revealed that when pons neurons were taken out of the loop, mice had less sleep and impaired muscle relaxation during REM sleep. On the other hand, activating these neurons increased the number and duration of REM episodes at the cost of wakefulness. This indicates that manipulating these neurons could potentially be used as a therapeutic strategy for sleep disorders."

The city has unveiled its very first dinosaur fossils, which likely belonged to a large dinosaur. These fossils were located on a remote island, adding substantial value to the field of palaeoecological studies in the area.\n\nThe fossils, which experts have dated back to the Cretaceous period, are undergoing further examination to determine their exact species. This new find is poised to shed light on the region's prehistoric past, acting as a cornerstone for future research efforts.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

        "article_content": "Micro SaaS, or Software as a Service, is a rising trend in the business world, especially for entrepreneurs and small businesses. With a focused approach on solving niche problems, Micro SaaS products offer smaller-scale, targeted solutions that don\u2019t require huge teams or budgets. In this guide, we\u2019ll explore how to identify the best Micro SaaS products and how you can leverage them for your business growth.\n\nWhat is Micro SaaS?\n\nMicro SaaS refers to smaller software tools or platforms that cater to a specific market or solve a highly niche problem. Unlike traditional SaaS, which often targets larger markets with broad functionality, Micro SaaS is designed for a smaller, more focused customer base. These tools are usually developed by solo entrepreneurs or small teams, making them highly specialized and lightweight.\n\nBenefits of Micro SaaS\n\nLow Start-up Costs : Micro SaaS products usually require minimal resources to develop and maintain, making them ideal for bootstrapping.\n\nScalability : As these products cater to niche markets, scaling can be more straightforward with less competition.\n\nRecurring Revenue : Most Micro SaaS products follow a subscription model, ensuring consistent income streams.\n\nHow to Identify Top Micro SaaS Products\n\nFinding the right Micro SaaS product to use or invest in requires research and understanding of market needs. Here\u2019s how to go about it:\n\n1. Analyze Your Business Needs\n\nBefore diving into Micro SaaS options, take a step back and evaluate your business requirements. Are there repetitive tasks that could be automated? Is there a specific problem you\u2019re struggling to solve? Identifying pain points will help you find SaaS products tailored to your specific needs.\n\n2. Research Niche Markets\n\nMicro SaaS thrives on niche markets, so understanding the market is key. Explore forums, social media groups, and industry-specific blogs to see what tools businesses in your sector are using. For example, if you run a small e-commerce store, you may discover a Micro SaaS product that helps with cart recovery or inventory management.\n\n3. Look for User Reviews\n\nOne of the easiest ways to find top-performing Micro SaaS products is through user reviews and testimonials. Sites like G2, Capterra, or Trustpilot provide insights into user experiences. By reading reviews, you can get a sense of how the product performs, its customer support, and any drawbacks to be aware of.\n\n4. Evaluate Scalability and Flexibility\n\nA good Micro SaaS product should be scalable and flexible enough to grow with your business. Before choosing a tool, evaluate its potential for growth. Will it still serve your business as you scale? Can the product be customized or integrated with other tools?\n\nTop Micro SaaS Categories to Explore\n\nThere are several categories where Micro SaaS products excel. Below are some of the most popular sectors for these tools:\n\n1. Marketing Automation\n\nMicro SaaS products in the marketing space are becoming increasingly popular. These tools focus on automating tasks like social media scheduling, email marketing, or even SEO analysis. Platforms like Buffer for social media management or MailerLite for email automation are prime examples.\n\n2. Project Management\n\nSmaller teams often need lightweight, easy-to-use project management tools. Trello and Notion are Micro SaaS platforms that offer simple solutions for task tracking and team collaboration without overwhelming users with complex features.\n\n3. Customer Support\n\nHandling customer inquiries efficiently is crucial for businesses. Micro SaaS products like HelpScout and Crisp provide simple and effective tools for managing customer support tickets, live chat, and FAQs. These tools focus on delivering value for small businesses that don\u2019t need enterprise-level solutions.\n\n4. E-commerce Optimization\n\nFor e-commerce businesses, Micro SaaS products like Gleam and OptinMonster offer features to help improve conversion rates, such as pop-ups, giveaways, and lead generation forms. These tools are perfect for small e-commerce stores looking to boost sales without massive marketing budgets.\n\nHow to Utilize Micro SaaS Products Effectively\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified the right Micro SaaS product for your business, the next step is maximizing its potential. Here are some strategies for making the most out of these tools:\n\n1. Start with a Free Trial\n\nMost Micro SaaS products offer a free trial or a freemium version. Use this time to test the tool in your workflow and assess its value. Pay attention to ease of use, integration capabilities, and the support provided during the trial phase.\n\n2. Integrate with Existing Tools\n\nOne of the best ways to utilize Micro SaaS products is by integrating them with your existing software stack. Many Micro SaaS tools offer API access or direct integrations with popular platforms like Slack, Zapier, or Shopify. By connecting these tools, you can create a more seamless workflow, saving time and effort.\n\n3. Use Data to Track Performance\n\nMicro SaaS tools often come with built-in analytics. Use these data-driven insights to measure how the product impacts your business. For example, if you\u2019re using a SaaS tool for lead generation, track how many leads convert into customers. Analyzing the ROI of the tool will help you decide whether to continue or explore other options.\n\n4. Focus on Customer Support\n\nMicro SaaS products usually offer limited customer support compared to large-scale SaaS platforms. Make sure to leverage whatever support channels are available, whether it\u2019s through a knowledge base, live chat, or email. Effective use of support resources can help you resolve issues quickly and get the most out of the product.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMicro SaaS products offer incredible opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs to streamline operations, increase productivity, and solve niche problems. By carefully identifying your needs, researching the best products in your sector, and utilizing them effectively, you can stay ahead of the competition without overwhelming your budget.\n\nWhether you\u2019re looking for marketing automation tools, customer support platforms, or e-commerce optimizers, Micro SaaS solutions provide a practical and affordable way to grow your business efficiently.

        "article_content": "Toast (NYSE: TOST) is a restaurant technology company with products for processing payments, taking orders, and more. And one year from now, Toast stock is likely to be trading higher than it is today.\n\nRevenue is growing at more than 20% annually, and management is demonstrating that it knows how to run a profitable business. Those two things are encouraging enough, but there's one more thing that makes me even more optimistic about the long-term prospects of this company.\n\nDon't overlook this adoption trend with Toast\n\nIn the second quarter, around 8,000 new restaurant locations started using Toast's technology. Admittedly, the second quarter is usually a strong one for the company, but this was a record amount of net new locations. And it answers a major question that shareholders had.\n\nIn 2023, Toast launched a new fee that outraged customers, leading management to quickly reverse the decision. But there are other restaurant technology companies out there, and shareholders were left wondering whether Toast had misstepped and alienated users from its platform.\n\nGiven the record number of net new locations in Q2, it appears Toast didn't suffer too much reputational damage. That being the case, there's good reason to believe its growth rate could accelerate.\n\nWhen Toast reaches 20% market share in a specific market, management calls this a flywheel market. It seems its existing customers become brand evangelists in those flywheel areas. Simply put, the company has noted stronger adoption rates, lower expenses, and consequently, higher profits, in flywheel markets.\n\nIn 2021, Toast had 20% or greater market share in only 5% of U.S. markets. In 2023, that jumped to 31% of U.S. markets. And it continues to climb in 2024, according to management.\n\nThe company only has 13% market share in the U.S. as a whole, but more and more markets are reaching a tipping point where taking more share gets easier.\n\nThinking about this from a big-picture perspective, Toast appears to be on a path to claiming a huge percentage of the overall restaurant space in the U.S., meaning the business could have many years of growth ahead of it.\n\nMore than just growth\n\nFor some time, I've been a believer in Toast's growth potential. I was a doubter when it came to its bottom line, but this company is proving me wrong in real time.\n\nToast provides hardware devices to customers at a gross loss, and payment processing is low margin. By contrast, its software subscription products are high margin. That's great, but it takes time for the software profits to get big enough to offset the losses elsewhere in the business. However, as this chart shows, Toast's gross profit margin is jumping higher recently as revenue soars.\n\nStory Continues"
