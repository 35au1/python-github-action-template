        "article_content": "During my first two months at Yale, I\u2019ve learned how to be an indulgent skeptic.\n\nThe Thursday before Family Weekend, I received an email advertising an 11-hour-long teach-in about UFOs, to which I responded with immediate incredulity. I wasn\u2019t quite sure that \u201cfree exchange of ideas surrounding a challenging subject\u201d could apply to government cover-ups of UFOs, a conspiracy theory seemingly on par with the flat Earth.\n\nI decided to reach out to Sydney Morrison \u201925, the leader of the Yale Student UFO Society, or YSUS, to find out what could lead a Yale student to believe that little green men in flying saucers were anything but pure science fiction. After a few back-and-forth emails, she explained her reasoning over lunch last Monday.\n\nSydney\u2019s story with ufology, the study of UFOs, began during her time away from Yale after her sophomore year. Throughout her childhood and teenage years, her idea of UFOs was much like mine: \u201cpotentially some weird spiritual thing, like a semi-religious phenomenon.\u201d But one night, while hanging out with a friend in a Washington park, they turned around simultaneously to see a large object with blinking lights in the sky. Unbothered at first, they then encountered an 8-foot-tall bulky humanoid object with two deer-like eyes, casually strolling around and absorbing all visible light entering its body. Sydney said that they got within two feet of the alien, which continued to stomp around and followed them back to their car.\n\nNaturally, this experience was \u201cpretty shaking,\u201d and Sydney started YSUS her next semester back at Yale to create a space for UFO believers \u2014 the only such space in the Ivy League. The club\u2019s main goal is to consolidate and present knowledge on UFO sightings.\n\nConvincing those in the Yale community is more of a secondary objective. Sydney explained that when talking about her experience to people outside the ufology community, she always begins with \u201cI know this sounds crazy\u201d or \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have believed it myself,\u201d but it\u2019s often unsuccessful; she\u2019s mostly given up on convincing people to believe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such pervasive stigma that associates UFOs with mental illness,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s scary when you do try to take [beliefs about UFOs] further into the media and the public.\u201d\n\nI felt sympathetic to her cause. If UFOs were to exist, I \u2014 and most of the world \u2014 would be virtually clueless, having been deaf to all those who claimed to have seen evidence. Sydney often wishes she hadn\u2019t had her sighting \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s kind of like the Matrix, where you can\u2019t go back after you\u2019ve seen something like that,\u201d she said. Personally, I\u2019d rather live my life unaware of any alien existence \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine being so utterly sure of a truth that my family and friends would never accept.\n\nCurious about what led other students to join the club \u2014 to voluntarily take the red pill \u2014 I talked to Lorenzo Chamberlin \u201928, YSUS\u2019s newest officer. He told me that he saw a poster advertising YSUS on the way to class one day and was immediately drawn to it. He\u2019s never had an experience with UFOs, though he would like to, and was enthusiastic about the club\u2019s efforts to find \u201cways to have those experiences.\u201d He quoted Sherlock Holmes to summarize his reason for joining: \u201conce you\u2019ve eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that Lorenzo wrote the original teach-in email that piqued my curiosity. Rereading it after our chat, I realized that his description of the event\u2019s purpose \u2014 raising awareness for \u201cwider epistemological challenges to accepted boundaries of scholarship and civic activism\u201d \u2014 was not a half-baked attempt at intellectualizing a joke but a genuine reflection on how deep our assumptions lie.\n\nOver the course of our lunch, Sydney presented a logical, well-thought-out argument. By the time she brought up postcolonialism and ontology, it was clear that she\u2019d spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours researching ufology.\n\nWe talked for around an hour, but most people don\u2019t devote that much time to understanding a claim viewed as fundamentally absurd. It\u2019s so easy to just dismiss someone as crazy when that\u2019s what the rest of the world thinks.\n\nIn my philosophy and astronomy courses, I\u2019ve learned about dozens of breakthroughs that were met with universal skepticism when they were first made. Ideas like philosophical questioning, the heliocentric theory and special relativity were incredibly controversial when proposed because they disrupted beliefs that felt safe and secure. Socrates, Galileo and Einstein \u2014 some of the most important contributors to human knowledge \u2014 were all shunned for their \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cpreposterous\u201d findings.\n\nSo maybe \u2014 however unlikely \u2014 UFOs are real and Sydney is the next Einstein. I\u2019m not quite convinced, but I\u2019ve learned to at least give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Nothing is for certain, and so to make a leap into the unknown, to challenge centuries of knowledge and billions of people, should be seen not as ignorance but bravery."

        "article_content": "There are eight endings to unlock in the remake of Silent Hill 2, with six classic endings returning and two new endings to experience.\n\nThe classic endings (Leave, In Water, and Maria) have the same basic triggers required to unlock them, with the biggest change being the item locations for the Dog, UFO, and Rebirth endings. The two new endings (Bliss and Stillness) have completely new items that you need to find and use in the correct places in order to unlock them.\n\nOur Silent Hill 2 endings guide details how to unlock all endings below, but do keep in mind that you need to have unlocked New Game Plus by completing the game once before you can get the majority of the endings in the Silent Hill 2 remake.\n\nPlease note that, as in the original, the Leave, In Water, and Maria endings seem to be primarily worked out through a point based system. This means that even if you follow our advice below, you could still get a different ending.\n\nOn this page:\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nHow to get Leave ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nLeave is the most common ending people get in Silent Hill 2 because it has the easiest triggers to activate. It's considered the 'good' ending because it gives a little hope for James' future. In short, to get this ending, you need to play like James actually wants to live. So healing quickly after being injured is the best way you can consistently work towards it.\n\nHere's how to get the Leave ending in Silent Hill 2:\n\nHeal right after James gets injured.\n\nPick the Snake Coin at the end of the Coin Cabinet puzzle.\n\nListen to Mary's entire sickbed speech in the long corridor near the very end of the game.\n\nDon't check on Maria at the hospital, or Labyrinth cell.\n\ncheck on Maria at the hospital, or Labyrinth cell. Don't investigate Angela's knife.\n\ninvestigate Angela's knife. Don't examine Mary's letter, photo, or Handkerchief more than once.\n\nIn our experience, healing right after James gets injured is almost a surefire way to get the Leave ending, if it's your first playthrough. We examined Mary's items, Angela's Knife, and checked on Maria - and we still got Leave.\n\nIt's also possible that the coin choice at the end of the Coin Cabinet puzzle in Wood Side Apartments doesn't affect the ending, but as you can pick from any of the three, it's best to pick a coin that might help you get the Leave ending, just in case.\n\nImage credit: Konami\n\nHow to get In Water ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nIn Water is another common ending, as its main trigger is also linked to James' health. You essentially need to play like James does not value his own life. So waiting a long time to heal - preferably when the screen has been red for a while - is the best way you can consistently work towards this ending.\n\nHere's how to get the In Water ending in Silent Hill 2:\n\nWait as long as possible before healing.\n\nPick the Man Coin at the end of the Coin Cabinet puzzle.\n\nExamine Angela's Knife at least twice.\n\nListen to Mary's entire sickbed speech in the long corridor near the very end of the game.\n\nDon't check on Maria at the hospital, or Labyrinth cell.\n\nAs we've said, it's possible that the coin choice at the end of the Coin Cabinet puzzle in Wood Side Apartments doesn't affect the ending, but as you can pick from any of the three, it's best to pick a coin that might help you get the In Water ending, just in case.\n\nImage credit: Konami / Bloober Team\n\nHow to get Maria ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nIn our experience, Maria is the most difficult ending to get in the Silent Hill 2 remake, unless you've already got the Leave and In Water endings. This is because it's not linked to health, so even if you give Maria all of the attention you need to help get her ending, your healing tactics are likely to give you Leave or In Water instead. Due to this, we recommend you unlock these regular endings first before attempting to get the Maria ending.\n\nWith this in mind, here's how to get the Maria ending in Silent Hill 2:\n\nPick the Woman Coin at the end of the Coin Cabinet puzzle.\n\nIf separated from Maria, unlock a door to reunite with her as soon as possible.\n\nFollow Maria to Jack's Inn immediately after leaving Rosewood Park with her (stick to the critical path until you enter Brookhaven Hospital).\n\nCheck on Maria multiple times at the hospital (at least after finding the Marked Bracelet, to trigger a cutscene).\n\nCheck on Maria multiple times while she's in the Labyrinth cell, and try to enter her cell again after she dies.\n\nDon't let Maria take damage.\n\nlet Maria take damage. Don't smash any glass around Maria, unless necessary.\n\nsmash any glass around Maria, unless necessary. Don't bump into Maria too much.\n\nbump into Maria too much. Don't examine Mary's letter, photo, or handkerchief.\n\nexamine Mary's letter, photo, or handkerchief. Don't examine Angela's Knife.\n\nexamine Angela's Knife. Don't bring your personal items into the Employee Elevator at Lakeview Hotel.\n\nbring your personal items into the Employee Elevator at Lakeview Hotel. Don't listen to Mary's entire sickbed speech in the long corridor near the very end of the game.\n\nOnce again, it's possible that the coin choice at the end of the Coin Cabinet puzzle in Wood Side Apartments doesn't affect the ending, but as you can pick from any of the three, it's best to pick a coin that might help you get the Maria ending, just in case.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nHow to get the Dog ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nYou need to play on New Game Plus to get the Dog ending in Silent Hill 2. If you are, then you need to get the Dog Key and use it on the Observation Room door in Lakeview Hotel to go and see Silent Hill's real mastermind. However, this time, the Dog Key is split into two Broken Key Parts in the remake, so you have to find and combine them first.\n\nBroken Key Part location 1\n\nThe first Broken Key Part that you need to get for the Dog ending is located inside the Pet Center store in East South Vale, which is found just left of the Big Jay's building, close to the Groovy Music store you need to visit to complete the Jukebox puzzle. The part is on top of a desk inside the small room at the back.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nBroken Key Part location 2\n\nThe second Broken Key Part that you need to get for the Dog ending is located inside a dog house in the garden of a house on the east side of Katz St. It's only accessible when you're exploring the West Side of South Vale after going through the gate at Jack's Inn with Maria.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nOnce you have both Broken Key Parts, combine them to make the Dog Key, then use the Dog Key to unlock the Observation Room on 3F of Lakeview Hotel, near room 312, to finally unlock the Dog ending. We recommend you save before unlocking the Observation Room door if you'd like to try and get another ending.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nHow to get the UFO ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nYou need to play on New Game Plus to get the UFO ending in Silent Hill 2. If you are, then you need to pick up the Blue Gem and use it at four unique locations to see the very unique alien-themed short film to unlock the UFO ending.\n\nBlue Gem location\n\nWhen playing on New Game Plus, the Blue Gem is located in the window of the Jewellers store in East South Vale, just north of the Big Jay's building, and Pet Center where you can find the first Broken Key Part.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nOnce you have the Blue Gem, 'Investigate' it from the main menu at these four locations to get the UFO ending:\n\nThe Rooftop of Saul Street Apartments in East South Vale, while standing beside the eye symbol printed on the vent. The western pier of Rosewood Park where you meet Maria, while standing beside the sign with the eye symbol printed behind it. Image credit: Eurogamer/Konami The docks of Lakeview Hotel while standing where you got off the boat after crossing Toluca Lake. In Room 312 of Lakeview Hotel, the same room where you watch the videotape.\n\nAs long as you investigated the Blue Gem at the previous three locations, you will automatically unlock the UFO ending when you investigate it in Room 312 at the end of Lakeview Hotel. So we recommend you make a save right beforehand if you'd like to get another ending after.\n\nHow to get Rebirth ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nYou need to play on New Game Plus to get the Rebirth ending in Silent Hill 2. If you are, then you need to pick up four new items and have them in your inventory at the end of the game to automatically unlock Rebirth. As long as you have these four items at the end, you will always unlock the Rebirth ending, no matter what choices you made before.\n\nThe four items you need to get the Rebirth ending are: Crimson Ceremony, White Chrism, Obsidian Goblet, and Lost Memories.\n\nCrimson Ceremony location\n\nCrimson Ceremony is located beside the grave near the water in the Graveyard, where you meet Angela for the first time right at the beginning of the game.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nWhite Chrism location\n\nWhite Chrism is located on the table outside of Baldwin Mansion in West Side South Vale, which you can access after going through the gate at Jack's Inn with Maria.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nObsidian Goblet location\n\nThe Obsidian Goblet is located inside a nook at the Historical Society in West Side South Vale, which you get access to after finding the Historical Society Key at Rosewood Park after completing the Brookhaven Hospital area.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nLost Memories location\n\nLost Memories is found on a shelf in the Lost and Found room in Lakeview Hotel on 1F. You can get into here by breaking the wall in Cafe Toluca.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nIf you've found all four of these items, you will get the Rebirth ending once you reach the end of the game, unless you trigger the Dog, UFO, Bliss, or Stillness endings beforehand.\n\nHow to get Bliss ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nBliss is one of the new endings in the Silent Hill 2 remake, but you can only get it if playing on New Game Plus. If you are, then you need to combine the new Rusted Key and Small Chest items to get the White Claudia, and then drink the White Claudia before watching the tape inside Room 312 of Lakeview Hotel to trigger the ending.\n\nSmall Chest location\n\nThe Small Chest is located inside the tiny enclosed seating area found in the northwestern side of the Garden in Brookhaven Hospital, which you get access to after finding the 1F Inner Ward Key on your way to solving the Hand puzzle. Crawl through a gap at the back to get into the small seating area.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nRusted Key location\n\nThe Rusted Key is located inside the safe at Pete's Bowl-O-Rama. The code is 1887, which you can find for yourself by picking up the Bloody Note by a body at the northwestern edge of town, near the Historical Society.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nHow to get Stillness ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nStillness is one of the new endings in Silent Hill 2 Remake, but you can only get it if playing on New Game Plus after getting the In Water ending. If you've done this, you need to find the Key of Sorrow to get the Toluca Postcard, which triggers the Stillness ending after you investigate the postcard from your inventory.\n\nKey of Sorrow location\n\nThe Key of Sorrow is located inside a green car on the northside of Wiltse Rd. near the beginning of the game, right after you leave the Ranch area. Use the Chainsaw you find near the Ranch in New Game Plus and break the car's windows to pick up the key.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nToluca Postcard location\n\nThe Toluca Postcard is inside the safe in the Manager's Office of the Otherworld Lakeview Hotel area. You need to use the Key of Sorrow and 314 code to open the safe and get the postcard.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nOnce you have the Toluca Postcard, investigate it in your inventory to automatically get the Stillness ending.\n\nNow that you know how to get every ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake, it's time to go and get the only ending that makes sense. Say hello to the dog for me!"

Chief among them is Adobe, whose Terms of Service debacle in the summer led to a fierce backlash from creatives. But the brand's latest move might just help ingratiate the company with AI-sceptics.\n\nThe company has announced a new Content Authenticity Web App designed to \"champion creator protection and attribution\". An extension of the Content Authenticity Initiative we've already seen Adobe develop over the last couple of years, the new web app offers a free way for creators to apply content credentials to their work.\n\nAdobe\n\nAs well as adding credentials, the web app lets creators set AI training and usage preferences, essentially letting artists opt-out of being trained by models. Of course, this relies on other models recognising this, but Adobe is \"actively working to drive industry-wide adoption of this preference.\"\n\nA free, public beta of the Adobe Content Authenticity web app will be available in Q1 2025, and users can sign up for more information here. As well as the web app, there'll also be a handy Chrome extension for inspecting credentials.\n\nAdobe Content Credentials web app\n\n\"Adobe\u2019s new tool for signing artwork is a game-changer,\" gushes illustrator Pepita Sandwich via the Adobe website. \"It makes adding Content Credentials to digital pieces easy and professional. The interface is intuitive and ensures seamless integration, while the security features give me peace of mind. I also love that it offers the option to opt-out of AI training\u2014perfect for protecting my creative rights.\"\n\nIt's certainly a timely move for a company that has endured its fair share of criticism from artists this year, as well as facing the small matter of getting sued by the US government over its convoluted cancellation processes. But with the brand having previously committed to \"doing the right thing\" when it comes to AI, focussing its efforts on the Content Authenticity Initiative seems like a wise move."

The process of creating a simple yet effective habit-tracking app using AI tools, specifically Cursor AI, requires no prior programming skills. As the AI-generated code and natural language processing, enables you to develop a fully functional app with ease, opening up a world of possibilities for aspiring app developers. In the video below Alex Finn takes you through the process step-by-step in just 7 minutes.\n\nGetting Started\n\nTo begin your app development journey, the first step is to download and install Xcode from the App Store. Xcode is Apple\u2019s official integrated development environment (IDE) and is essential for building iOS applications. Once you have successfully installed Xcode, create a new iOS project and give it a meaningful name, such as \u201cHabit Tracker.\u201d This initial setup forms the foundation of your app, allowing you to focus on designing an intuitive user interface and implementing key features rather than getting bogged down in complex coding tasks.\n\nSimplifying App Development with AI\n\nThe next step is to download and open Cursor AI, a powerful tool that simplifies the app creation process through AI-powered code generation.

        "article_content": "Joanna MacGugan\n\nSpecial to Worcester Magazine\n\nImagine sitting in the dark in a tiny, shabby cabin where enslaved people once prepared meals for the residents of the mansion next door. It\u2019s after midnight. You\u2019ve scattered video cameras around the cabin. You ask questions about the lives of those who labored here, and you hope that you\u2019ve captured their answers on your audio recorders. You glance down a short passageway and watch, saucer eyed, as a video camera launches itself off a wicker chair for no discernible reason.\n\nOnce you recover from your shock, you try to recreate and debunk it. You can\u2019t. Could it possibly be something paranormal?\n\nExperiences like this often lead me to reflect on the unexpected turns life can take. Sometimes you land someplace completely weird, and you find a sense of belonging you never expected. After 15 years of training as a historian, I assumed a traditional teaching job would be waiting for me after graduation. Instead, I\u2019m investigating reportedly haunted houses and writing about them. Looking back, the leap from scholar to paranormal investigator might not be as strange as it seems because I investigate to better understand history.\n\nMore:Connell Sanders: Mama loves to rock, and baby's along for the big noise\n\nMore:Last Call: Historian looks for clues to life, death and justice in medieval Ireland\n\nEven when we can\u2019t verify something we learn from an investigation as historical truth, the story becomes an important part of the haunted location\u2019s lore. And when the historical record matches up with our paranormal experiences, we\u2019ve struck gold.\n\nI\u2019ve found my favorite people in the paranormal community. We share more than a love for all things spooky; we\u2019re connected by curiosity and a desire to tell the stories of those who have passed. We bond over experiences that nobody else would understand.\n\nWe also support each other\u2019s creative pursuits; we are writers, photographers, filmmakers and musicians. And the best paranormal conventions (or paracons) feel more like family reunions than your ordinary geeky gatherings. There\u2019s the darker side of the paranormal community, too \u2014 the big egos, fame-seekers and petty drama. But it\u2019s easy enough to look past them and find the people you want on your team. I\u2019ve joined countless paranormal investigations in the U.S. and the U.K., and I\u2019ve met kindred spirits who are now lifelong friends.\n\nWhen we investigate haunted places, we protect each other. We learn our teammates\u2019 body language, and we recognize when they\u2019re uncomfortable and need to leave the scene. Our camaraderie often dispels tension in places where traumatic events happened.\n\nSometimes we catch the best electric voice phenomena (electronic voice phenomenon, also known as EVPs; unexplained voices imprinted on audio recordings) when we\u2019re relaxed and trading lighthearted banter \u2014 the kind that comes from people who genuinely like each other. There\u2019s no judgment. We understand each other, and we know that our experiences are real. We don\u2019t really care if other people might think we\u2019re bonkers.\n\n\u201cCommunity\u201d means something different for everyone. Since I found mine, I\u2019ve learned what it feels like to let my guard down and embrace the weird, because we\u2019re all weirdos at heart. If hanging out in haunted places after dark and hoping for an experience you can\u2019t explain is your idea of a good time, come celebrate the weird with us. You\u2019re always going to be welcome in the paranormal community.\n\nJoanna MacGugan is a social historian, copy editor, and paranormal investigator. She is currently writing a history of the Peter Oliver House in Middleborough."

No-code platforms, equipped with codeless app design capabilities, empower your team to create and deploy apps without writing a single line of code.\n\nThis means that even team members who aren't traditionally tech-savvy can contribute to the app development process, significantly speeding up project timelines.\n\nImagine you're tasked with improving customer engagement through a new interactive app. With a codeless app design tool, you can drag and drop elements to assemble a prototype within hours, not weeks. This rapid prototyping accelerates development and allows for iterative testing and feedback, ensuring the final product meets user needs while aligning with your strategic goals.\n\nOptimal Flexibility with WYSIWYG App Builders\n\nA crucial element of digital transformation is flexibility\u2014the ability to pivot and tailor solutions in real-time as your business needs evolve. What You See Is What You Get, or WYSIWYG app builders, exemplify this flexibility. They allow you to build and edit your applications visually, seeing exactly how they'll appear to the end-users as you construct them.\n\nThis hands-on approach reduces misunderstandings and miscommunications between business departments and IT teams. For example, your marketing team can directly create landing pages and promotional apps, ensuring that the end design matches their vision without back-and-forth with developers.\n\nThis saves time and empowers your non-technical staff to execute their ideas independently.\n\nReducing Costs and Resource Allocation\n\nOne significant impact of no-code in your digital transformation strategy is cost reduction. Traditional app development involves significant investment in technical staff, extended development timelines, and often expensive fixes and iterations.\n\nNo-code platforms change this dynamic by minimizing the need for a large development team and reducing the dependency on external IT consultants or software development companies.\n\nIntegrating no-code tools into your strategy allows you to allocate your financial and human resources more efficiently. Savings on technical development can be redirected towards other critical areas, such as market research, customer experience improvements, or expansion strategies.\n\nMoreover, the ease of updating applications built with no-code tools means that maintaining and improving your digital assets becomes less costly and more manageable over time.\n\nDriving Business Agility and Competitive Advantage\n\nNo-code platforms give your business the agility to stay ahead of the curve.

        "article_content": "Gregory Wakeman Freelance Writer\n\nThe 1960s and early 1970s ushered in a sea change in the American comedy scene. Acts by the likes of Bob Hope and Jerry Lewis grew stale; their material, often focused on marriage and stereotypes, failed to excite the maturing baby boomer population. New faces, including Phyllis Diller, Richard Pryor and George Carlin, told radical jokes about sex, race and politics in clubs and theaters across the United States, as well as on best-selling albums. But this seismic shift had yet to be reflected on television sets. \u201cTelevision was still a safe format, and it was very much trapped in its earliest days, when it had transitioned from radio,\u201d says filmmaker Gil Kenan.\n\nEnter \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d the sketch comedy variety show that launched a cultural revolution and the careers of Eddie Murphy, Will Ferrell, Kristen Wiig and Bill Murray, to name but a few of the hallowed actors who have worked their magic at Studio 8H, 30 Rockefeller Plaza.\n\nSince its debut almost 50 years ago, on October 11, 1975, \u201cSNL\u201d has aired more than 950 episodes. It\u2019s difficult to imagine just how different the television landscape was when the show premiered. That was the challenge facing Kenan, who co-wrote Saturday Night, a new movie that details the true story of the 90 minutes before the very first episode of the show, with writer-director Jason Reitman. The pair\u2019s script focuses on \u201cSNL\u201d creator and producer Lorne Michaels (played by Gabriel LaBelle) as he tries to control a rambunctious gaggle of writers and comedians while appeasing network executives who have little faith in the show\u2019s success.\n\nSATURDAY NIGHT - Official Trailer (HD) Watch on\n\n\u201c\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 was the jolt of a new generation that was going to war against this institution and was trying to force something new on it,\u201d says Kenan. The film\u2019s script captures that thrill of something new, balancing historical accuracy with cinematic drama, all against the backdrop of larger-than-life characters. To mark Saturday Night\u2019s arrival in theaters across the U.S., here\u2019s a rundown of how \u201cSNL\u201d came to be five decades ago.\n\nThe origins of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d\n\n\u201cSNL\u201d owes its start to Johnny Carson\u2019s desire for more time off. In 1974, the talk show host asked NBC to air reruns of \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\u201d on weeknights instead of weekends, as the network had been doing for years. That way, he could have some extra days off during the week.\n\nNBC President Herbert Schlosser approached Dick Ebersol, the vice president of late-night programming at the network, about creating a live show that could air at 11:30 p.m. on Saturday nights. \u201cSchlosser wanted to try something new in that period,\u201d says Doug Hill, co-author of Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live, a 1985 book that chronicles the first ten years of the show. \u201cHe wanted a show that could be like \u2018The Today Show\u2019 or \u2018The Tonight Show,\u2019 something that had the chance to be on for a long time.\u201d\n\nIt was Ebersol who decided to recruit Michaels for the gig. Born and raised in Toronto, Michaels had enjoyed some success in television, starring in and producing the variety show \u201cThe Hart & Lorne Terrific Hour,\u201d which ran on Canadian television in 1970 and 1971. Michaels was well aware of the comedy community across the U.S.: Second City in Chicago, the Groundlings in Los Angeles and the Proposition in Boston were popular in their respective cities. \u201cAll the clubs spoke the same language and had the same attitude toward conventional network television, which was that it was horrible,\u201d says Hill. \u201cIt had nothing to say to them and was completely dishonest.\u201d\n\nAfter producing television comedy specials for actress Lily Tomlin in Los Angeles, Michaels found himself frustrated and angry about what he wasn\u2019t allowed to do on the air. \u201cFrom Lorne\u2019s point of view, and the point of view of the comedy underground scene, they couldn\u2019t tell the truth on television,\u201d says Hill. All Michaels had to do was look across the pond to Great Britain, where \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus,\u201d with its mix of absurd scenarios, daring sight gags, sketches without obvious punchlines and unpredictable jokes, had enjoyed great success, to grasp that folks stateside were missing out.\n\nWhen Ebersol approached him, Michaels explained that he \u201cwanted to make a television show for the generation that grew up on television,\u201d says Hill. More than that, he wanted to bring a modern attitude and point of view to the medium, which had never really been done before in a consistent way. Michaels moved television into a new phase, emerging as \u201ca bridge figure in the sense that he totally understood the comedy underground scene and was a part of it, but he could also speak to the network in a smart and slick way that they could swallow,\u201d Hill adds. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t scare them.\u201d\n\nOver three weeks in late 1974, Ebersol and Michaels decided to make a variety show that appealed to 18- to 34-year-olds by mixing comedy sketches, political satire and musical performances.\n\nBut the pair ran into trouble almost immediately. Michaels and Ebersol realized they needed a budget of $180,000 per episode\u2014around $30,000 more than they\u2019d expected. NBC wanted to be even more frugal, saying the budget couldn\u2019t be higher than $134,600, as the network didn\u2019t expect the show to generate much advertising revenue, and it was already risking losing the $20,000 in profit that it earned from airing Carson reruns every weekend. While the showrunners and NBC agreed on the $134,600 figure, each episode of \u201cSNL\u201d ultimately cost more than that.\n\nThe Wolverines - Saturday Night Live Watch on\n\nSome NBC executives doubted that the show would be engaging enough to keep an audience of young adults at home to watch it on a Saturday night. It was Michaels who charmed and convinced Schlosser to give \u201cSNL\u201d a chance. In a meeting, Michaels repeatedly made the NBC president laugh, then said he\u2019d have the right formula by episode ten. Schlosser replied, \u201cI\u2019ll watch show ten,\u201d silencing the naysayers.\n\nMichaels spent the next ten months casting the show, securing performers like Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin and Dan Aykroyd, and lining up the first \u201cSNL\u201d writers\u2019 room, which included Anne Beatts, Al Franken and Michael O\u2019Donoghue.\n\nEven if Michaels didn\u2019t scare the higher-ups at NBC, as depicted in Saturday Night, the rest of the \u201cSNL\u201d cast did terrify them the closer the show got to making its debut. In the film, NBC executive David Tebet (portrayed by Willem Dafoe) is so unconvinced by the disastrous dress rehearsal that he almost doesn\u2019t allow \u201cSNL\u201d to air, while comedian John Belushi (Matt Wood) refuses to sign his contract because he doesn\u2019t want other comedians to see that he\u2019s on television\u2014that\u2019s just how unpopular the medium had become with comics. Both of these are (mostly) true stories.\n\nBringing \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d to the silver screen\n\nReitman and Kenan, who previously co-wrote Ghostbusters: Afterlife and Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, started discussing how to tell the story of the first night of \u201cSNL\u201d during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWe know the extraordinary effort required to bring anything to life in an entertainment space, let alone anything new,\u201d says Kenan. \u201cIt was particularly personal for us to write about the battle to make something new, especially in real time.\u201d\n\nAfter reading every bit of material they could find about the show\u2019s first season, the co-authors began to have conversations with the people who were actually there. Reitman grew up with some of them: His father, Ivan Reitman, directed \u201cSNL\u201d alums Aykroyd and Murray in multiple films, including Ghostbusters.\n\n\u201cWe kind of pitched Lorne the idea of the movie that we were hoping to make,\u201d Kenan recalls. \u201cLorne thought it was interesting and in his own very guarded \u2026 way gave us his blessing.\u201d At that point, Kenan and Reitman conducted even more interviews with anyone and everyone who was in the building that night. After they secured Michaels\u2019 approval, most people were more than willing to talk to them.\n\nUltimately, the pair spoke to \u201cmore than 40 and less than 50\u201d people over the course of a few months, Kenan estimates. This process saw them talk to every living cast member, crew member and writer who was involved in the first episode of \u201cSNL.\u201d Kenan calls creating the film \u201cprobably the most journalistic writing process that either of [them] had ever done.\u201d\n\nWhen quizzed whether this means that every moment in Saturday Night is fact-checked and double-sourced, Kenan can\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cThe good thing about being storytellers, rather than actual journalists, is that we have no code of ethics whatsoever and zero journalistic standards,\u201d he says.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the cast and crew told the co-authors competing narratives. \u201cEveryone had slightly different perspectives on that night,\u201d Kenan says. \u201cWe used these multiple points of view as fuel for our narrative engine. That really allowed us to dive into the chaotic nature of what it was like to put this thing together in the few minutes they had before it went live. It just added combustion to this lively narrative.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to casting Saturday Night, the last thing Kenan and Reitman wanted to do was offer an impersonation of each legendary performer. \u201cThe idea was to find actors who could really capture that one piece of essence that is required for this movie,\u201d Reitman tells Screen Rant. For Gilda Radner, that meant finding an actress (Ella Hunt) who could capture the comedian\u2019s willingness to sacrifice anything about herself to make someone else feel better. For Chase (Cory Michael Smith), they looked for someone able to embody a man with a huge ego who needed to be taken a down a peg or two.\n\nFor Garrett Morris, the filmmakers looked for an actor who could relate to his identity struggles as the first Black cast member of \u201cSNL,\u201d a performer previously known more for his dramatic work than his comedic chops. As actor Lamorne Morris (who shares a last name with his character but is not related to him) tells the Hollywood Reporter, \u201cI have a very similar walk in my career. I was always called \u2018the Black dude from that show.\u2019 For a long time, people didn\u2019t know my name. They just knew, \u2018You\u2019re the Black dude.\u2019 So I identified with that for sure.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Kenan says he and Reitman decided to squeeze stories that happened in the days leading up to the first show, as well as incidents that happened in the weeks and months that followed, into the movie\u2019s 90-minute time frame. \u201cWe were trying to create an impression of the experience, vibe and energy of what it was like putting the show on, rather than trying to be too literal about the events that transpired,\u201d he explains.\n\nSeveral of the movie\u2019s dramatic moments\u2014including set designer Neil Levy getting too high to work; the writers hanging a Big Bird stuffed toy by the neck for their own amusement, much to Jim Henson\u2019s fury; and comedian Milton Berle treating the cast terribly\u2014happened during the making of the show\u2019s first season, just not in the lead-up to the first episode as Saturday Night depicts.\n\nThe Killer Bees: Home Invasion - SNL Watch on\n\nDespite the cast\u2019s antics and the fact that most of its members had never been on television before, all of them \u201cknew their stuff because they\u2019d been performing in the comedy underground for years,\u201d says Hill. \u201cThey were talented and funny as hell. Lorne called them \u2018enlightened amateurs.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t some sloppy group of people who messed up all the time. They delivered.\u201d\n\nMichaels also charmed the network, helping to paper over these issues and get \u201cSNL\u201d on the air, says Hill. \u201cLorne is an incredible talker. He could explain the show and weave a spell over the network executives. They\u2019d come out saying, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not really sure what he was talking about specifically, but it sounded great.\u2019 He was so impassioned and so determined after he\u2019d had the bad experiences with network television in Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nWhile Michaels felt he would need ten episodes to find the right formula for \u201cSNL,\u201d Hill believes the cast and crew landed on the correct combination with the fourth episode, hosted by actress Candice Bergen. In that episode, the cast featured in most of the sketches, as opposed to the second episode, which included 11 musical performances by host Paul Simon. The episode was also less experimental: It was the first one in which the cast appeared with the host at the end to wave goodnight. \u201cThat\u2019s still the structure of the show now,\u201d Hill says. \u201cBefore then, they were overbooking the show with guest comedians and musical guests. But since episode four, it has been the same.\u201d\n\nThe counterculture audience that \u201cSNL\u201d was aiming to attract had been so turned off of television that it took several seasons for them to discover there was actually a show that spoke to them. \u201cThe contrast between what \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 was doing was so dramatic from what had been on television before,\u201d says Hill. \u201cBy the third season, the show had become a hit. By the fourth and fifth seasons, it was one of the most profitable shows on NBC.\u201d\n\nOver the past 49 years, \u201cSNL\u201d hasn\u2019t just repeatedly launched the careers of comedians, actors and bands. It has skewered politicians and helped viewers make sense of that week\u2019s news and current events in a funny and engaging manner. As Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller write in Live From New York: The Complete, Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, the show has become a \u201ckeepsake to be handed down from generation to generation.\u201d\n\nWhile Kenan admits that it has been terrifying to show the film to the cast and crew of that premiere episode, he says their reactions have been heartwarming. \u201cThey have all found things about the film that, for them, are incredibly evocative,\u201d he adds. \u201cFor many, it\u2019s been emotional. Even though they\u2019ve gone on to have such incredible careers, this was still their first bright burst. It holds a special place in their lives.\u201d\n\nSaturday Night Live Duos - SNL Watch on"

        "article_content": "The Tennessee Titans will return from their bye in Week 6 to face the Indianapolis Colts and their offense is looking to build on a season-best showing that saw a big contribution from running back Tony Pollard, but not wide receiver Calvin Ridley.\n\nPollard took on a massive workload in a game that saw the Titans running it a ton. Pollard had 22 carries for 88 yards and a touchdown, and he was fairly productive in the passing game with two catches for 20 yards.\n\nRidley, on the other hand, was almost non-existent in the 30-point outburst. The vet wide receiver saw just three targets and turned them into one catch for five yards. He also added one carry for 10 yards.\n\nThe Colts present a favorable matchup for both Pollard and Ridley, but should they be in fantasy football lineups in Week 6? Let's find out.\n\nFantasy Football Start 'Em, Sit 'Em Week 6: Calvin Ridley\n\nIs Ridley capable of putting up big numbers any given week? Sure, but he simply has not been consistent enough to trust him in lineups. After a decent start to the year, Ridley has just two catches on six targets for 14 yards and one carry for 10 yards over the last two weeks.\n\nIt isn't all his fault, though, as the quarterback play has been atrocious, and the offensive line isn't helping that.\n\nIf you're forced to start Ridley because of bye weeks and/or injuries, you can feel at least somewhat good about it with the Colts ceding the seventh-most fantasy points per game to wide receivers.\n\nVerdict: Sit 'Em\n\nFantasy Football Start 'Em, Sit 'Em Week 6: Tony Pollard\n\nPollard has easily been the most consistent fantasy football producer for the Titans this season. Going into the Week 5 bye, Pollard ranked as RB18 overall and has three games with 15-plus fantasy points in PPR, making him an every-week starting option in an RB or flex spot.\n\nLast week reinforced the idea that Pollard is Tennessee's lead back. Even in a game in which Tyjae Spears saw 17 touches, Pollard still had more with 24. There is no threat to the veteran back's status as the top dog in Tennessee's backfield.\n\nLooking ahead to Week 6, Pollard draws a matchup against a Colts defense giving up the 12th-most fantasy points per game to backs, and the second-most rushing yards per game overall.\n\nVerdict: Start 'Em"

The Hyderabad police's recent arrest of 18 cyber fraudsters from Rajasthan brought 10 cyber crimes to light in which people lost money ranging from Rs 1.1 lakh to Rs 2.9 crore.\n\nThe fraudsters targeted homemakers, software engineers and senior citizens; and their favourite act was digital arrest.\n\nHyderabad cybercrime DCP D. Kavitha said the fraudsters laid particular focus on senior citizens and their preferred modus operandi was digital arrest. \u201cWith the help of just an Aadhaar card or a phone number, the fraudsters will access the name, date of birth, number of email accounts and bank accounts and the victims. The fraudsters were well aware that they can easily threaten senior citizens and squeeze them for a lot of money. They threaten them in the name of arrest by posing as high-ranking police officials,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe narrated the plight of a senior citizen who was digitally arrested for two days in his own house. \u201cIn one of the cases, a retired employee was digitally arrested. He was virtually under the control of the fraudsters for two full days even though he was in his house. The retired employee was scared to inform his wife or children about his condition since the fraudsters warned him that they too would be arrested. It has gone to an extent where he was intimidated to report for every three hours on his activities. The fraudsters found that they could easily threaten these people and squeeze as much money as possible through this medium.\u201d\n\nAfter the arrest of 18 fraudsters from Rajasthan, about 10 cases filed between December 2023 and August 2024 came to light. During the investigation of these cases, police found that the accused had used different types of fraud including investment in stock markets for better results, sextortion and OTP and extortion fraud. Three main accused were identified as Sanjay Biman Das, Shaiukul Khan Mewati and Kapil Bhausaheb Nagare. They were also the final beneficiaries of the frauds.\n\nDespite these criminals extorting huge sums of money from the victims, the people could seize only Rs 5 lakh cash from their possession. They have used the rest of the money to fund their lavish lifestyle and trips to Dubai and other countries.\n\nOne officer mentioned, \u201cThese accused used up 70 per cent of the extorted money and have invested in setting up another call centre and hiring callers to commit another scam after their release. The accused also pay commissions to the suppliers and purchase bank accounts from illiterate persons by paying them Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000 per account.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the 10 cases, the police could freeze Rs 1.61 crore from the bank accounts related to the accused. The trail of the transactions is yet to be identified. To arrest these fraudsters, Hyderabad city police have sent several teams to Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Maharashtra."
