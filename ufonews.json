            "article_content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed how we handle natural language processing. They can answer questions, write code, and hold conversations. Yet, they fall short when it comes to real-world tasks. For example, an LLM can guide you through buying a jacket but can\u2019t place the order for you. This gap between thinking and doing is a major limitation. People don\u2019t just need information; they want results.\n\nTo bridge this gap, Microsoft is turning LLMs into action-oriented AI agents. By enabling them to plan, decompose tasks, and engage in real-world interactions, they empower LLMs to effectively manage practical tasks. This shift has the potential to redefine what LLMs can do, turning them into tools that automate complex workflows and simplify everyday tasks. Let\u2019s look at what\u2019s needed to make this happen and how Microsoft is approaching the problem.\n\nWhat LLMs Need to Act\n\nFor LLMs to perform tasks in the real world, they need to go beyond understanding text. They must interact with digital and physical environments while adapting to changing conditions. Here are some of the capabilities they need:\n\nUnderstanding User Intent\n\nTo act effectively, LLMs need to understand user requests. Inputs like text or voice commands are often vague or incomplete. The system must fill in the gaps using its knowledge and the context of the request. Multi-step conversations can help refine these intentions, ensuring the AI understands before taking action.\n\nTurning Intentions into Actions\n\nAfter understanding a task, the LLMs must convert it into actionable steps. This might involve clicking buttons, calling APIs, or controlling physical devices. The LLMs need to modify its actions to the specific task, adapting to the environment and solving challenges as they arise.\n\nAdapting to Changes\n\nReal world tasks don\u2019t always go as planned. LLMs need to anticipate problems, adjust steps, and find alternatives when issues arise. For instance, if a necessary resource isn\u2019t available, the system should find another way to complete the task. This flexibility ensures the process doesn\u2019t stall when things change.\n\nSpecializing in Specific Tasks\n\nWhile LLMs are designed for general use, specialization makes them more efficient. By focusing on specific tasks, these systems can deliver better results with fewer resources. This is especially important for devices with limited computing power, like smartphones or embedded systems.\n\nBy developing these skills, LLMs can move beyond just processing information. They can take meaningful actions, paving the way for AI to integrate seamlessly into everyday workflows.\n\nHow Microsoft is Transforming LLMs\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s approach to creating action-oriented AI follows a structured process. The key objective is to enable LLMs to understand commands, plan effectively, and take action. Here\u2019s how they\u2019re doing it:\n\nStep 1: Collecting and Preparing Data\n\nIn the first phrase, they collected data related to their specific use cases: UFO Agent (described below). The data includes user queries, environmental details, and task-specific actions. Two different types of data are collected in this phase: firstly, they collected task-plan data helping LLMs to outline high-level steps required to complete a task. For example, \u201cChange font size in Word\u201d might involve steps like selecting text and adjusting the toolbar settings. Secondly, they collected task-action data, enabling LLMs to translate these steps into precise instructions, like clicking specific buttons or using keyboard shortcuts.\n\nThis combination gives the model both the big picture and the detailed instructions it needs to perform tasks effectively.\n\nStep 2: Training the Model\n\nOnce the data is collected, LLMs are refined through multiple training sessions. In the first step, LLMs are trained for task-planning by teaching them how to break down user requests into actionable steps. Expert-labeled data is then used to teach them how to translate these plans into specific actions. To further enhanced their problem-solving capabilities, LLMs have engaged in self-boosting exploration process which empower them to tackle unsolved tasks and generate new examples for continuous learning. Finally, reinforcement learning is applied, using feedback from successes and failures to further improved their decision-making.\n\nStep 3: Offline Testing\n\nAfter training, the model is tested in controlled environments to ensure reliability. Metrics like Task Success Rate (TSR) and Step Success Rate (SSR) are used to measure performance. For example, testing a calendar management agent might involve verifying its ability to schedule meetings and send invitations without errors.\n\nStep 4: Integration into Real Systems\n\nOnce validated, the model is integrated into an agent framework. This allowed it to interact with real-world environments, like clicking buttons or navigating menus. Tools like UI Automation APIs helped the system identify and manipulate user interface elements dynamically.\n\nFor example, if tasked with highlighting text in Word, the agent identifies the highlight button, selects the text, and applies formatting. A memory component could help LLM to keeps track of past actions, enabling it adapting to new scenarios.\n\nStep 5: Real-World Testing\n\nThe final step is online evaluation. Here, the system is tested in real-world scenarios to ensure it can handle unexpected changes and errors. For example, a customer support bot might guide users through resetting a password while adapting to incorrect inputs or missing information. This testing ensures the AI is robust and ready for everyday use.\n\nA Practical Example: The UFO Agent\n\nTo showcase how action-oriented AI works, Microsoft developed the UFO Agent. This system is designed to execute real-world tasks in Windows environments, turning user requests into completed actions.\n\nAt its core, the UFO Agent uses a LLM to interpret requests and plan actions. For example, if a user says, \u201cHighlight the word \u2018important\u2019 in this document,\u201d the agent interacts with Word to complete the task. It gathers contextual information, like the positions of UI controls, and uses this to plan and execute actions.\n\nThe UFO Agent relies on tools like the Windows UI Automation (UIA) API. This API scans applications for control elements, such as buttons or menus. For a task like \u201cSave the document as PDF,\u201d the agent uses the UIA to identify the \u201cFile\u201d button, locate the \u201cSave As\u201d option, and execute the necessary steps. By structuring data consistently, the system ensures smooth operation from training to real-world application.\n\nOvercoming Challenges\n\nWhile this is an exciting development, creating action-oriented AI comes with challenges. Scalability is a major issue. Training and deploying these models across diverse tasks require significant resources. Ensuring safety and reliability is equally important. Models must perform tasks without unintended consequences, especially in sensitive environments. And as these systems interact with private data, maintaining ethical standards around privacy and security is also crucial.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s roadmap focuses on improving efficiency, expanding use cases, and maintaining ethical standards. With these advancements, LLMs could redefine how AI interacts with the world, making them more practical, adaptable, and action-oriented.\n\nThe Future of AI\n\nTransforming LLMs into action-oriented agents could be a game-changer. These systems can automate tasks, simplify workflows, and make technology more accessible. Microsoft\u2019s work on action-oriented AI and tools like the UFO Agent is just the beginning. As AI continues to evolve, we can expect smarter, more capable systems that don\u2019t just interact with us\u2014they get jobs done."

There is no doubt in the world that this house is a very haunted house. It always has been.\n\n\"It started off with smaller things that nobody really cared about.\n\n\"The doors would open, the kettle would turn itself on, the implements by the fire would swing back and forward, the doors would open and shut, the latches on the doors would go up, the taps would turn on. All that general stuff.\n\n\"All of the sudden the room would go freezing cold and you could see the black thing there. That started off quite soon, within days really. I knew the first day.\n\n\"I've been the guardian of this special house since 2004. It's now time for me to let somebody else look after it.\"\n\nThirteen witches were kept there before they were put on trial.\n\nThe most famous was Ursula Kemp who was tried for witchcraft and hanged in 1582 along with two others.\n\n7 Vanessa claimed mysterious blood spatters appeared on the walls Credit: swns\n\n7 The kitchen possesses plenty of character Credit: swns\n\n7 The most recent owners used the two-bed property as a holiday let\n\nThe Cage remained as a prison for men, women and children up until 1908 before it became a private residence.\n\nThe house featured in Channel 4 documentary True Horror 'The Witches Prison' which aired on Halloween night in 2018.\n\nParanormal experts have visited from all over the world.\n\nVanessa has also penned a book \u2018Spirits of the Cage\u2019 about the events.\n\nShe left the home with son Jesse in 2008 to move into rented accommodation and has since desperately been trying to flog it.\n\nThe cottage itself comprises three reception rooms, a kitchen, a ground floor cloakroom, plus two bedrooms and a bathroom on the split level first floor.\n\nA plaque on the building describes the plight of Ursula Kemp, who was imprisoned in The Cage on suspicion of witchcraft before being hanged in Chelmsford in 1582.\n\nEstate agent Florent Lambert, director of Home Domus, said: \u201cVanessa did try to sell The Cage numerous times since 2008 and with a number of different estate agents.\n\n\u201cMost agents advised her to sell at auction at ridiculous prices or were not at all interested as they predicted it could not be sold.\n\n\u201cI took it as a challenge and a mission to find the way to best sell it.\u201d"

            "article_content": "At one point in Choo Mantar, we see the chilling hide-and-clap scene from The Conjuring being played on a tablet. It\u2019s a terrific scene that relies more on concept than sound. Karvaa Navaneeth\u2019s latest horror drama needed such out-of-the-box thinking to achieve its full potential.\n\nChoo Mantar has all the tropes of a typical horror film. You have a haunted mansion built during the British era. Expectedly, there is a backstory to it. Unusual happenings inside the bungalow trap a family of four, and a paranormal activist has to crack the mystery.\n\nSharan plays the ghostbuster who decides to fix the dreaded reputation of the mansion. Called Dynamo, he is hailed as one of the best paranormal researchers in the country. His subordinates are essayed by Chikkanna, Aditi Prabhudeva, and Kiran Chandrashekhar.\n\nChoo Mantar (Kannada) Director: Karvaa Navaneeth Cast: Sharan, Chikkanna, Aditi Prabhudeva, Meghana Gaonkar, Runtime: 142 minutes Storyline: Four friends enter a haunted house looking for a treasure. Unexpected events threaten their lives\n\nChoo Mantar begins as a horror comedy, with Chikkanna and Sharan delivering witty lines, but the humour soon loses its sheen because the dialogues turn from cheeky to silly. The film takes quite a while to get going, with the first big twist arriving at the interval point. The surprise, though, is worth the wait, and Navaneeth sets the film up nicely, only to deliver an underwhelming second half.\n\nThe film lacks solid jump scares. Showing the ghosts as hideous monsters, Choo Mantar takes the old-school route to scare people. Despite the valiant performances of Meghana Gaonkar and Aditi Prabhudeva, the movie doesn\u2019t grip you with fear.\n\nALSO READ:Finding Bengaluru in Kannada cinema\n\nIt\u2019s confusing why director Navaneeth treats the film as a thriller. Every plot point in the story leads to a surprise. While such twists aren\u2019t bad, Choo Mantar fails to do the basic duty of a horror film: to scare the audience. The movie is well mounted with the cinematography and the background score doing justice to the backdrop. The rousing climax is whistle-worthy but feels force-fitted to produce an impact similar to what we experienced in Kantara (2022).\n\nI enjoyed the final surprise, a nod to a yesteryear horror hit involving a superstar. Sharan\u2019s character, in fact, has a lot of similarities to that famous character from the popular movie. Though gimmicky, the sequel idea feels quite juicy to think of, especially if you consider the probability of a horror universe in Kannada cinema. In case there is a continuation, the franchise must have a perfect balance of suspense and horrifying drama.\n\nChoo Mantar is currently running in cricket"

            "article_content": "Federal antitrust regulators on Friday added weight to portions of Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit seeking to prevent OpenAI from restructuring itself into a fully for-profit company.\n\nIn a brief filed with a federal court in California, attorneys for the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust division did not directly support Musk\u2019s claims that OpenAI and Microsoft have colluded in an anticompetitive \u201cde-facto merger,\u201d but they did urge the court to be skeptical about one of the defenses made by OpenAI\u2019s legal team.\n\nOpenAI began as a non-profit, funded in part by Musk, and then converted itself into a for-profit company controlled by a non-profit board of directors. It is now planning to completely separate from that non-profit board and become a public benefit corporation, allowing it to be fiduciarily responsible to investors rather than beholden to a charitable mission.\n\nA key contributor to OpenAI\u2019s growth and the pressure for it to become a profitable business has been the more than $13 billion in investments and other support it\u2019s received from Microsoft, a publicly traded company that competes in the AI market. Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, is a member of Microsoft\u2019s board and was a member of OpenAI\u2019s board until March 2023. A top Microsoft executive, Dee Templeton, was a non-voting member of OpenAI\u2019s board from November 2023 until July 2024.\n\nMusk has argued that the Microsoft representatives\u2019 positions on the OpenAI board violated federal antitrust laws that prohibit someone from serving on the governing board of competing companies, which is known as an interlocking directorate. OpenAI has responded by saying the argument is moot because neither Hoffman nor Templeton are members of OpenAI\u2019s board anymore.\n\nThe FTC and DOJ lawyers, however, wrote that \u201cending an interlocking directorate, e.g., by having a person resign from a corporate board, is not sufficient, on its own, to moot a claim under Section 8 of the Clayton Act. \u2026 In resolving this matter, the Court should avoid holding otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe federal agencies did not weigh in on Musk\u2019s many other allegations, including that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman misled him and conspired with Microsoft to convince investors not to fund Musk\u2019s own AI startup, xAI.\n\nWhile the lawsuit has often taken the tone of a soap opera feud between billionaires, the FTC and DOJ filing is another sign that regulators have a close eye on OpenAI\u2019s transition plans. Delaware\u2019s attorney general has filed a brief in the case and said she will take action if she believes OpenAI is violating the law and Meta has asked the California attorney general\u2019s office to block OpenAI\u2019s restructuring."

Cruise operators are tweaking their offerings to meet growing demand and fit an evolving traveller.\n\nSolo travel, wellness offerings and improvements in sustainability lead cruise trends this year. And expedition cruises are expected to continue attracting people, having already seen an increase of 71 per cent in passengers from 2019 to 2023. Here\u2019s a quick look at what\u2019s ahead.\n\nSolo travel\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: HX Expeditions has reported 53 per cent growth in solo cruisers between 2022 and 2023.Hurtigruten Expeditions/Supplied\n\nMore women are boarding cruise ships on their own, making up two-thirds of solo cruise travellers, a steadily rising cohort, according to Samuel Spencer, owner and general manager of Calgary-based Ocean & River Cruises Travel. \u201cSmall groups foster a more inclusive environment for solo travellers, and women are gravitating toward expedition cruises or river cruises,\u201d he says.\n\nHX Expeditions, based in Oslo, Norway, sails through Greenland, the Northwest Passage/Canadian Arctic, Patagonia and Alaska, among other destinations. Between 2022 and 2023, HX Expeditions reported a 53 per cent growth in solo cruisers, who represent one in four of its passengers. To attract solo tourists, its expedition ships offer some itineraries without single supplements \u2013 a premium fee for individuals using a cabin designated for two \u2013 along with discounts or credits for solo passengers. In 2024, 50 per cent of solo travellers sailed HX Expeditions without paying a single supplement; the other 50 per cent received discounts.\n\nTo meet the demand, Celebrity Cruises' most recent ships, Celebrity Beyond (2022) and Celebrity Ascent (2023) have more solo staterooms than other cruise lines. Both ships offer 32 ocean-view staterooms with an \u201cinfinite veranda,\u201d a floor-to-ceiling window that opens with the press of a button. Some ships only offer solo travellers interior cabins, with ocean-view rooms available with a single supplement fee.\n\nRiver cruise companies Avalon and Tauck have also embraced solo cruisers, offering cabins without single supplement fees on every journey. Riviera River Cruises also has a lengthy list of solo traveller cruises without fees for singles on many of the most popular European routes such as the Rhone through Burgundy, France, or the Duoro River through Portugal\u2019s Douro Valley.\n\nSustainability\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: The No. 1 environmental issue for the cruise industry is reducing its dependence on fossil fuels.Trym Ivar Bergsmo/HX Hurtigruten Expeditions\n\nMost cruise companies are adopting energy-efficiency measures, recycling, reducing water waste and eliminating single-use plastics. There are even ships able to produce fresh water on board, according to CLIA.\n\nThe association has ambitious plans for all its ocean cruise members to reduce carbon emissions globally by 40 per cent by 2030 and reach net zero carbon by 2050.\n\nBut the No. 1 environmental issue for the cruise industry is reducing dependence on fossil fuels. According to CLIA\u2019s 2023 sustainability report, there are 32 pilot programs testing sustainable fuels, with 24 focused on biofuels produced from waste oil and fats.\n\nEven the world\u2019s largest cruise ship \u2013 Royal Caribbean\u2019s Icon of the Seas \u2013 is trying to do its part. The 7,600-passenger ship is powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), which produces 30 per cent fewer carbon emissions compared with oil. Sixty per cent of new ships from now until 2028 will be powered by LNG, CLIA says.\n\nAs of 2026, ships sailing Norway\u2019s fjords that are below 10,000 gross tonnes can only use alternative fuels; this ruling extends to larger ships by January, 2032. Norway\u2019s Hurtigruten Group has been an early adopter of sustainable practices, working closely with the communities it visits.\n\n\u201cSustainability has been our top priority for the past 15 years, during which we have launched multiple industry-leading firsts,\u201d stated Carly Biggart, vice-president of the Americas for Hurtigruten. The cruise line was the first to ban the use of heavy oil in 2009 and single-use plastics in 2018. It has three battery-hybrid powered ships after introducing the first one in 2019. Last year, it had one of the lowest food-waste-per-guest ratios in the industry. Plus, Hurtigruten Group is developing what it hopes will be the world\u2019s first zero emission ship, scheduled to launch in 2030.\n\nBut do travellers care about how ecofriendly a cruise ship is? \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about thoughtful travel, like to the Arctic, Antarctica or Galapagos, travellers expect the operators to be doing their due diligence,\u201d Spencer, of Ocean & River Cruises Travel, says, \u201cbut the majority aren\u2019t asking about sustainability.\u201d\n\nFriends of the Earth, an international network of environmental groups, is paying attention, however, and isn\u2019t impressed by the industry\u2019s status. The organization\u2019s 2024 cruise ship report card paints a bleak picture when it comes to sewage treatment, air pollution and waste-water quality. But there are 10 companies who were given an A grade for transparency of their sustainability status: Disney, Regent, Hurtigruten, HX, Viking, P&O Australia, Virgin, Oceania, MSC and Norwegian.\n\nWellness\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: Virgin Voyages' adults-only ships embrace wellness trends like spas with hydrotherapy circuits, mocktails and healthy dining options with gluten-free and vegan items.Virgin Voyages\n\nRest and relaxation is not just about laying back in a deck chair. It\u2019s getting easier to focus on wellness while at sea.\n\nFor many, that might mean travelling without children. And Virgin Voyages' adults-only ships offer an irreverent interpretation of traditional ocean cruising that embraces wellness trends.\n\n\u201cThe traditional kid areas have been reimagined into outdoor gyms, yoga areas and hammock lounges on our ships,\u201d said CEO Nirmal Saverimuttu. \u201cWe are proudly a kid-free market.\u201d\n\nJanuary is \u201cwell-being season\u201d on Virgin Voyages, with all sailings this month featuring additional wellness options such as acupuncture and personal training. But every ship offers spas with a hydrotherapy circuit, mocktails and healthy dining options with gluten-free and vegan items.\n\nRiver cruising is upping its wellness game, too. In spring 2023, AmaWaterways built a full-sized pickleball court on the sundeck of AmaMagna, which will sail Europe\u2019s Danube in 2025. This river cruise line was one of the first to introduce bicycles for passengers to use in port and in 2019 began hiring \u201cwellness hosts\u201d \u2013 certified sports medicine specialists and personal trainers \u2013 to lead workout classes, guide bike tours and design active excursions at destinations.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: The Mareel Wellness and Beauty Thermal Suite on board Cunard's Queen Anne is one of many new wellness initiatives offered by the cruise line.Christopher Ison/Cunard\n\nOn board Cunard\u2019s Queen Anne, which launched in spring 2024, a much-improved spa experience includes more saunas, pools, foot baths and workout spaces, plus a three-day wellness-at-sea program where passengers can choose to relax, energize or detox. Plus, the ship\u2019s Pavilion Wellness Caf\u00e9 offers healthy cuisine options.\n\nWellness-focused passengers also look to Oceania Cruises for its spa experience on board. The Aquamar Spa + Vitality Center programs offer travellers thalassotherapy pools, spa treatments, fitness and foods curated for individual wellness plans. In port, passengers taking part in the program can sign up for wellness shore excursions such as the Hell\u2019s Gate Mud Bath Retreat in Rotorua, New Zealand, or meditating with a monk in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nCyclists who like to sail can also join the combined offering from Canadian luxury tour operator Butterfield & Robinson and L.A.-based Uniworld River Cruises. An eight-day Rhine River cruise from Basel to Amsterdam, with two departure options in May and in September, blends B&R\u2019s cycling route cultural immersion expertise with the unpack-once delights of cruising.\n\nRunners should look at the Run for Fun Cruise Tours, which partners with AmaWaterways and Norwegian Cruise Lines to set up 5K races in several ports. In February, 2025, the Caribbean itinerary begins in New Orleans and heads south to Belize, Honduras and Mexico, then in September, starting from Honolulu, Hawaii, runners can take part in 5K races on the islands of Kaui, Hawaii Island and Maui."

            "article_content": "The beginning\n\nBorn in Greensboro, U.S., in July 1859, Henry Louis Smith did his schooling at the local high school, which was run by his uncle. He entered Davidson College in 1877, and while he graduated with honours in 1881, his involvement with them lasted much longer.\n\nHe served as the principal of the Selma Academy for five years, during which time he not only demonstrated his teaching ability, but also how he could engage in promotional activities. During his tenure, the school\u2019s enrollment quadrupled, and a new building was constructed for classes.\n\nThat brought him back to Davidson College, where he was recruited to be the professor of natural science (physics and astronomy). Smith, however, availed a year\u2019s absence and put that time to good use by obtaining an M.A. degree in 1887 from the University of Virginia. He commenced his teaching after that, briefly returning to Virginia again in the academic year of 1889-90 to earn his Ph.D. in physics.\n\nBringing X-rays to the U.S.\n\nOn two major occasions, Smith\u2019s scientific knowledge had positive consequences globally. The first of those was in January 1896 when he played a telling role in bringing X-rays to the U.S.\n\nHaving read about Roentgen\u2019s recent discovery of X-rays and his experiments in Germany, Smith decided to put it to the test in his laboratory. Working with some of his students, Smith constructed an X-ray machine using Crookes tube.\n\nWhile the accounts vary here as to whether or not Smith was directly involved, we can say with certainty that on January 12, 1896, X-ray pictures were produced for the first time in the U.S. A variety of objects were X-rayed, including rifle cartridges, rings and pins inside a pillbox, and even a human finger (story goes that three students bribed a janitor to let them into the anatomy lab on campus, before using a pocket knife to slice a finger from a corpse\u2026 doing all of this in secrecy, afraid of the consequences if they were to be found out!).\n\nSmith conducted further experiments in February. He himself obtained the hand of a corpse from a local physician, and shot a bullet into that hand. The resulting X-ray image was probably the first demonstration of X-rays ability to tellingly reveal both natural and foreign objects within the human body. This picture was published on February 27 in the Charlotte Observer.\n\nIn the years that followed, Smith conducted one of the first clinical applications of X-rays. Along with a team of medical practitioners, Smith employed X-rays to detect a tailor\u2019s thimble that a child from Harrisburg had swallowed, which the doctors then successfully removed.\n\nBalloons for peace\n\nThe year he brought X-rays to the U.S. was also the year in which Smith grew further at Davidson College, as he was named vice-president in 1896. The turn of the century worked wonders for him as he was elected president of Davidson College in 1901.\n\nHe held that position for over a decade, departing only to become the president of Virginia\u2019s Washington and Lee University. The fact that his father had graduated from here had been a tug strong enough for Smith to make the move and make his presence felt there.\n\nAlas, World War I was just around the corner and it drew the energies of almost everyone involved. While it is well established that wars and the accompanying arms race usually bring benefits to the fields of science and technology, Smith ensured that science and tech provided an impetus on the peace efforts of World War I too.\n\nClose to the end of that war, a prize was offered for those who could come up with a method of informing the German people about U.S. President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s plans for peace. Keeping in mind the prevailing winds, Smith suggested attaching Wilson\u2019s message to gas-filled balloons and releasing them from France.\n\nWith the timing seemingly right, the Allies acted on the idea and sent across innumerable such balloons in the hope that it would be carried to Germany. The plan worked as the majority of German soldiers who surrendered carried this message with them. Wilson, in fact, credited Smith for shortening the war considerably.\n\nAble teacher and administrator\n\nThe success that Smith enjoyed at Selma Academy was something that he was able to replicate wherever he went. Blessed with an energetic mind and endless energy, Smith more than tripled Davidson College\u2019s enrollment during his time there, and more than doubled the size of the student body at Washington and Lee University.\n\nAn administrator par excellence, he is celebrated largely for the work that he put in to not only enhance intellectual standards, but also raising the bar for admission requirements. A gifted speaker, Smith lost no opportunity to seek funds from all sources, even if it meant travelling excessively for the cause of promoting his institution.\n\nAt heart, however, Smith was a teacher. He was recalled by students as \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201centhusiastic\u201d and he initiated and implemented so many projects for his students that they aptly gave him the nickname \u201cProject\u201d.\n\nEven after retiring from academic life at the age of 70 in 1929, Smith remained active until shortly before his death in February 1951. As someone who set up facilities for recreation and exercises for his students as he believed that a strong body was necessary for a strong mind, Smith made sure he was agile throughout, both intellectually and physically.\n\n***\n\nThe discovery of X-rays\n\nA serendipitous accident was behind the discovery of X-rays by German physician Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen on November 8, 1895.\n\nRoentgen was using Crookes tube to conduct experiments in his laboratory. This experiment involved evacuating a glass bulb and filling it with a special gas. When a high-voltage current was then passed through it, it produced a fluorescent glow.\n\nRoentgen noticed a green coloured fluorescent light could be seen coming from a screen setting that was about 10 feet from the tube, despite the fact that the tube was heavily shielded with a black cardboard.\n\nRoentgen came to the correct conclusion that he was dealing with a new kind of ray. He named it X-ray, going with the nomenclature used in mathematics to indicate an unknown quantity. The name stuck.\n\nRoentgen made an X-ray image of his wife Bertha\u2019s hand to confirm his discovery. The iconic image, which proved beyond doubt the existence of X-rays, plainly showed the bones of her hand along with the ring on one of her fingers."

            "article_content": "Though it sometimes feels like everyone's following the same trend (AI), the technology we saw at CES 2025 was remarkably diverse, from practical devices for your home to mind-bogglingly powerful laptops to the next revolutions in health tech.\n\nSome of the concepts at CES might come years in the future (or never), while many other products are available for sale right now. Here are the six biggest trends from CES that we think will make the largest impact in 2025.\n\nIf you're looking for the very top products from the trade show, be sure to check out the official 2025 Best of CES Awards, selected by the CNET Group.\n\nRobots keep getting better, smarter, cuter, smaller and creepier\n\nMost of the non-novelty robots shown at CES bear a functional resemblance to the robots used commercially -- by that I mean you can tell they're the product of the same research in movement and AI as they pick things up, fold, clean and so on. Expensive models like Mi-Mo, Beatbot, R2D3 and more.\n\nSamsung's yellow Ballie home robot is going to ship this year. James Martin/CNET\n\nMore consumer-friendly models were less functional, like the tiny, fuzzy bots that you hang on your handbag as a fashion statement or the adorable model with huge anime eyes that follows you around on wheels but seems like a surveillance nightmare (the TCL AI Me). There were also the concepts of yesteryear that finally edged toward saleability, such as Samsung's Ballie -- a spherical bot with a projector in its belly, like a baby Teletubbie.\n\nWatch this: Sorry, There Are No 'Best Robots' at CES This Year 03:22\n\nOn the \"whut?\" front perches a tiny robot whose function is simply to blow on hot beverages.\n\nBut the models that resonated the most with us were home helpers that don't cost tens of thousands of dollars, like Roborock's Saros Z70 robot vacuum cleaner -- it sports an arm that can pick up your socks -- or Eureka's J15 Max Ultra, which detects spills and untangles its own brushes. And one of the most innovative was the Lymow One, a robot mower that cuts the grass and feeds mulched matter back to your lawn. There's always a ton of laundry robots -- unsurprising given how much everyone hates laundry -- like Tenet's AI Laundry Robot, which washes and folds.\n\nAnd we can't forget the token \"most human-looking\" robot, Realbotix's $175K Aria robot, which is designed for \"companionship and intimacy\" -- and looks it, given she's built along the lines of an old-school Barbie.\n\nUltimately, we chose not to pick a best robot because of how removed they were from interaction. In fact, many of the expensive models were in more of a zoo environment: Look at the magical creature in its habitat, repeatedly picking things up and moving them elsewhere. That's the kind of thing we've been seeing for years.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nNvidia doesn't make robots, but it's been working on its robot LLMs and operating systems for years. And every time Nvidia trots out this visual at its events, I can't help but think that Nvidia is building a robot army. Well, that and Metropolis.\n\nAI inside, again, but more powerful\n\nThere seemed to be less hype about AI in devices (though it's possible I have successfully learned to tune it out), but about the same in mobile apps like Delta's AI concierge. However, it was everywhere in laptops thanks to the annual chip updates from Intel and AMD -- which of course brought the usual faster, better and improved battery life -- plus bundles of \"try it!\" software for your out-of-the-box AI experience.\n\nWatch this: Everything Announced at Nvidia's CES Event in 12 Minutes 11:47\n\nBut in this respect, Nvidia stole the show for its Cosmos AI model (Nvidia has been working on and licensing its various models for autonomous cars, robots and more for years, but this seemed to be its biggest \"moment\"), as well as its unveiling of the newest generation of consumer graphics.\n\nRead more: Nvidia Hands-Down Won AI at CES 2025, and Also the Show Itself. Here's Why That Matters\n\nThe GeForce RTX 50 series not only promises the typical performance bump PC gamers expect, but thanks to the new Blackwell generation of GPUs, it brings more powerful and better generative AI capabilities down to your local system. That means cheaper entry for developers, the ability for end users to run bigger models, as well speed improvements (via Nvidia's DLSS 4) and more sophisticated capabilities for games.\n\nWatch this: These New Smart Glasses Want to Be Your Next AI Companion 02:31\n\nThere weren't a lot of new smart glasses, but Halliday's stood out for the way they present information: Rather than on the screen, they have a tiny monochrome display that shows text.\n\nRead more: Commentary: The Smart Glasses Moment Is Here. But They're Still Missing Something Big\n\nThe big AI news for cars at CES wasn't, for once, autonomininity: It was Volkswagen bringing ChatGPT to its voice assistant for more complex, natural-language help.\n\nRead more: Nvidia's CEO Explains How Its New AI Models Could Work on Future Smart Glasses\n\nCouch potato 'tainment\n\nOne of CES' core pillars is entertainment (it used to be baked right into the name), which generally means TVs and audio. There weren't any new screen technologies, but there were improvements and innovations with existing ones.\n\nThe suction cups on the back of the Displace TV James Martin/CNET\n\nTweaks to OLED came to TVs, with LG's G5 OLED's quality bump impressing us the most for its better brightness and contrast, along with HiSense's 116-inch MicroLED model. But the TV that seemed to make the biggest impact on us were Displace's hang-anywhere-thanks-to-huge-suction-cups TVs, shipping versions of prototypes we've seen in past years.\n\nWatch this: Displace TV's 55-Inch Television Hangs From a Wall Using Suction Cups 03:15\n\nI think its impact was partly due to the enormous opportunity for \"suck\" puns.\n\nThere was the usual complement of gaming desktops, laptops and monitors, the latter offering the typical year upgrade to higher refresh rates (500Hz and 600Hz).\n\nWatch this: Lenovo's New Legion Go S Gaming Handheld Is Lighter and Smaller but Packs a Big Surprise 03:30\n\nBut the biggest hit was Lenovo's new handheld console. The company is the first to offer (or at least announce) a SteamOS-based model, one of the new Legion G S models. Acer's Nitro Blaze 11 gaming handheld, however, earned some mockery, because you can't really respect a \"handheld\" if it's bigger than your head.\n\nRead more: Commentary: The Time for an Xbox Handheld Is Now\n\nBut it was also kind of hard to sustain excitement about gaming hardware at CES this year, because of a shiny new thing possibly on the horizon. Rumors say the Nintendo Switch 2 is coming soon.\n\nHealth and beauty, the staples of CES\n\nSometimes I think CES specializes in sleep, skin and smart rings, plus technology designed to make you feel like a loser -- so many smart mirrors, though none yet use generative AI to simulate your mother's critical voice or to show you what you could look like if you just tried harder. But maybe that's just me.\n\nThere may not have been as many this year, but there were some standouts. Withing's Omnia smart mirror combines a scale and a mirror to not only tell you if you're overweight and in bad health, but to show you as well. There's always a device for analyzing your skin to tell you what to buy to fix it, such as L'Oreal's BioPrint. (To be fair, I don't know what it's suggestions are.)\n\nWatch this: I Said Yes to Trying a Smart Ring You Can Propose With 01:45\n\nAnd, oh, the rings. One way to attract attention among the plethora of rings designed to monitor your health is to make it gold and platinum, like the UltraHuman Rare ring: Nothing's more romantic than a ring that says, \"Marry me\" and \"Please don't die,\" simultaneously. Or alternatively, \"Show me off on Instagram.\"\n\nDon't forget the annual dose of flatware that makes you healthier. This year's entrant is Kirin Electric Salt Spoon, intended to give you that salty taste without any of the nasty sodium -- by zapping your tongue with a bit of electricity. On the other hand, if they could do that for chocolate, I'd be first in line.\n\nLisa Eadicicco/CNET\n\nAnd while the Nike x Hyperice's \"boatlike booties are basically recovery high-tops festooned with buttons and designed to help your weary tootsies recover from soreness and strain,\" they sound pretty awesome.\n\nBut there were some truly practical and innovative new products, like the Ozlo Sleepbuds, which stay in, are flush with your ears for side sleepers and have sensors and other tech to help improve the quality of your sleep. Our team also called out the YoctoMat, a smart yoga mat that provides feedback on your poses. And while I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as health or beauty, in the interest of hydration, the Roam SodaTop is a bottle cap with a CO2 cartridge so you can carbonate your water on the go.\n\nHome is where the heat is\n\nHome tech tends to cover a lot of bases, many of them robotic. No one really likes to vacuum, do laundry or mow the lawn like the AI-driven robot vacuums and lawnmower I mentioned above.\n\nRead more: Commentary I Really Don't Want an AI Pot to Turn My Plant Into a Tamagotchi From Hell\n\nVideo smart locks seemed to be the focus of home security upgrades this year -- we call out Lockly's Vision Prestige and TCLs Smart Lock D1 Ultra -- providing more information than existing models. Notable, also, because someone breaking in doesn't use the video doorbell.\n\n23 Fascinating Home Tech Gadgets We Saw at CES 2025, the Biggest Tech Show on Earth +21 More See all photos\n\nCooling and heating were hot as well, especially Samsung's DHS Mono R32 HT heat pump, which heats outside air, condenses it to water and feeds it to your water tank. As an apartment dweller, I'm partial to the Gradient All-Weather 120V Window Heat Pump, which supplies heat when the weather gets frosty. Cooling and heating go hand-in-hand with utility bills and power backup -- I was really intrigued by the BioLite, which provides battery backup for a couple of key appliances, like the refrigerator.\n\nAnd Savant's Smart Budget is designed to save you money by routing power automatically (and manually) to balance output, thereby potentially saving you the expense of rewiring your home to support new, power-sucking devices. Plus, Aqara introduced the Touchscreen Dial V1, a clever and useful dial that can control all your smart devices\n\nAnd lest we forget the bread-and-butter of small appliances. There are always plenty, though really it's the oddballs and gimmicks that catch more attention than the mundane. This year, we saw the phone-controlled Panasonic HomeChef 4-in-1 Multi-Oven, the Apecoo tortilla and roti maker (food samples really seemed to attract us), LG's \"Perfect Fancy Microwave for Social Media\" with a 27-inch display and much, much more.\n\nThe future and the future's future\n\nThe big deals for cars (and other things that tote people) tend to be new technologies and other future-flung concepts. BMW gave us panoramic IDrive with operating system X, a three-tier, ultra wide holographic 3D windshield display that's actually not too far out from your next BMW, and Hyundai Mobis holographic windshield display one-ups it by constraining the angle of view to the driver.\n\nWatch this: Aptera Solar EV Gets All the Energy It Needs From the Sun 04:45\n\nWe see flying cars at the show every year, but sadly we're no closer to me getting one. This year's concept-du-jour was the Xpeng AeroHT, a massive six-wheeler with an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle in its trunk. Aptera's solar EV isn't a flying car, but it really looks like it should have wings.\n\nThe Pebble Flow Electric RV concept -- solar chargeable -- came back for a visit, as did Sony's Afeela, and the latter is ready for your money, if not delivery. Honda trotted out prototypes of its 0 series EVs (one step closer to reality than the concept we saw last year), a sports sedan and a van. See the new photos.\n\nBut a new motor concept claims to vastly increase the range of EVs -- arguably more important than all the shiny paint and glowy dashboards.\n\nGeoffrey Morrison/CNET\n\nAnother concept that appealed to me personally was Nanosys' next-gen MicroLED, dubbed UV LED, which uses ultraviolet light to energize RGB quantum dots to precise frequencies: Different lIght frequencies are how we perceive color. MicroLED may potentially supplant OLED in big screens and small. It somewhat upstaged Samsung's MicroLED watch concept with an uber-bright screen. Samsung also brought us a somewhat disturbing-looking stretchable screen for a 3D-ish view and a transparent MicroLED screen. Lenovo's concept ThinkBook with a rollable screen looks and gesture controls appear sleek.\n\nIn a class by itself, the Flint Paper Battery claims to be a new, sustainable power source that may eventually replace lithium ion with cellulose.\n\nWatch this: I Made Things Weird Trying TSA's New Shoe Scanner Machine 03:53\n\nFinally, I will never forget Bridget Carey smuggling Gummy Worms in her shoe to test TSA's new scanner -- after complaining about the ick factor of shuffling our socks or bare soles across a floor that's had thousands of other shoes scrape across it. Gummy Worms in your shoe has a pretty high ick factor, too."

            "article_content": "The collapse of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria has alarmed many regional countries, including the UAE and Egypt - but Israel is particularly concerned by this development.\n\nAn Israeli government committee has even suggested that a Syria ruled by Sunni Islamists who don\u2019t recognise Israel\u2019s right to exist could potentially pose a bigger threat to the country than Iran, Israel\u2019s archenemy.\n\nThe committee was particularly unnerved by Turkey\u2019s influence in Syria, claiming that Ankara could use the new Syrian government as a proxy force \u201cto restore the Ottoman Crown to its former glory\u201d - whatever that means.\n\nThe report noted that Ankara could rapidly rearm the new Syrian government, potentially triggering a direct conflict between Israel and Turkey.\n\nBut is this a realistic scenario? In short, the answer is no.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nAlthough Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has gradually weakened Turkish-Israeli bilateral relations - cutting trade ties, denying air travel to senior Israeli officials, accusing Tel Aviv of genocide at the International Court of Justice, and delivering fiery populist speeches hinting that the Turkish army could one day aid the Palestinian people - there is no indication that Ankara seeks a military confrontation with Israel.\n\nApart from the fact that both Turkey and Israel are US allies, and the two sides have never engaged in a military conflict, Ankara has no appetite for such adventures - especially while the region is already grappling with an ongoing war between Iran and Israel, alongside the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza.\n\nTurkey's objectives in Syria\n\nTurkey\u2019s aims in Syria are very clear, and they have been communicated both publicly and privately to all actors involved.\n\nFirstly, as Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan noted, Ankara wants a stable Syria that poses no threat to other nations. Secondly, Turkey envisions a democratic, unitary and civil state in Syria - one that embraces minorities and all ethnic groups, while preventing the formation of a Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) statelet.\n\nAfter hosting millions of Syrian refugees for more than a decade and conducting multiple military operations, which have cost Turkish lives and hundreds of millions of dollars, Ankara wants a Syria that can economically and socially flourish. A conflict with Israel, whether direct or indirect, does not align with that goal.\n\nAn Israeli report recently suggested that Tel Aviv prefers a fragmented Syria to safeguard its security interests. This is a mistake\n\nSo far, Turkey\u2019s actions have supported these objectives.\n\nAnkara initially - and to a large extent - turned a blind eye to Israel\u2019s aerial campaign to destroy remnants of the Assad regime\u2019s military facilities. But after Israel expanded its targets significantly, Fidan announced that Turkey had relayed a message to Israel that such attacks must stop.\n\nFidan acknowledged Israeli concerns that arms, such as chemical weapons, could fall into the wrong hands. Notably, Israel has avoided striking any Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) targets.\n\nFurthermore, Turkey has reportedly taken the first steps to establish a deconfliction mechanism with the Israeli military in Syria. Reports also point to routine engagements between Turkish and Israeli intelligence agencies.\n\nIn addition, according to my sources, Ankara has encouraged HTS leaders, including Ahmed al-Sharaa, to issue statements advocating calm with Israel. Several HTS figures have publicly said they are not seeking a clash with Israel.\n\nRisks of fragmentation\n\nMeanwhile, according to my Turkish contacts, there are indications that Damascus may seek to engage Ankara militarily, potentially moving Turkish advisers to Syrian military academies and airbases, to help re-establish a unified Syrian army under the Syrian defence ministry.\n\nTurkey is mindful of Israeli concerns regarding such cooperation. What I hear is that Turkey's deployments will be limited. They would not go beyond Hama and, to some extent, Damascus - an effort to reassure Israel that Ankara\u2019s actions are not hostile.\n\nBut Israel must come to terms with the fact that Ankara will not tolerate a PKK-controlled statelet in northern Syria. Turkey has consistently insisted that Kurdish groups must be integrated into a unified Syrian state.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attacks on Syria threaten regional stability and will ultimately backfire Read More \u00bb\n\nAn Israeli report recently suggested that Tel Aviv prefers a fragmented Syria to safeguard its security interests. This is a mistake.\n\nAnother report in Israel Hayom this week also talked about Israel's plan for an international conference to divide Syria into canons.\n\nA fragmented Syria would be a breeding ground for armed groups, further destabilising the region and creating long-term risks for Israel. By contrast, a democratic and inclusive Syria serves everyone\u2019s interests.\n\nUnfortunately, it is clear that Israel\u2019s leadership prefers dealing with autocratic regimes, which are more transactional and reliable in their oppressive policies - making Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and the occupied West Bank easier to justify and swallow.\n\nIt is true that Turkey now has a friend in Damascus. Erdogan stands to benefit from this relationship on multiple fronts: domestically, economically and regionally.\n\nBut this does not mean that the new Syrian government will become a Turkish proxy. On the contrary, if fortune is on our side, Syria will - for the first time - have a legitimate administration focused on one thing only: rebuilding the country as a place of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye."

            "article_content": "While it's still too early for an accurate tally of the financial toll, the losses so far likely make the wildfires the costliest ever in the U.S., according to various estimates.\n\nThe devastating blazes have killed at least 11 people and incinerated more than 12,000 structures since Tuesday, laying waste to entire neighborhoods once home to multimillion-dollar properties.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The wildfires that erupted this week across Los Angeles County are still raging, but already are projected to be among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.\n\nA preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. By comparison, AccuWeather estimated the damage and economic losses caused by Hurricane Helene, which tore across six southeastern states last fall, at $225 billion to $250 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis will be the costliest wildfire in California modern history and also very likely the costliest wildfire in U.S. modern history, because of the fires occurring in the densely populated areas around Los Angeles with some of the highest-valued real estate in the country,\u201d said Jonathan Porter, the private firm\u2019s chief meteorologist.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAccuWeather factors in a multitude of variables in its estimates, including damage to homes, businesses, infrastructure and vehicles, as well as immediate and long-term health care costs, lost wages and supply chain interruptions.\n\nThe aftermath of the Palisades Fire in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles on Saturday. John Locher/Associated Press\n\nThe insurance broker Aon PLC also said Friday that the L.A. County wildfires will likely end up being the costliest in U.S. history, although it did not issue an estimate. Aon ranks a wildfire known as the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, in 2018 as the costliest in U.S. history up to now at $12.5 billion, adjusted for inflation. The Camp Fire killed 85 people and destroyed about 11,000 homes.\n\nThe L.A. County wildfires, which were fueled by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds and an extreme drought, remained largely uncontained Saturday. That means the final tally of losses from the blazes is likely to increase, perhaps substantially.\n\n\u201cTo put this into perspective, the total damage and economic loss from this wildfire disaster could reach nearly 4% of the annual GDP of the state of California,\u201d AccuWeather's Porter said.\n\nIn a report Friday, Moody's also concluded that the wildfires would prove to be the costliest in U.S. history, specifically because they have ripped through densely populated areas with higher-end properties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the state is no stranger to major wildfires, they have generally been concentrated in inland areas that are not densely populated. That's led to less destruction per acre, and in damage to less expensive homes, Moody's noted.\n\nThat\u2019s far from the case this time, with one of the largest conflagrations destroying thousands of properties across the Pacific Palisades and Malibu, home to many Hollywood stars and executives with multimillion-dollar properties. Already, numerous celebrities have lost homes to the fires.\n\n\u201cThe scale and intensity of the blazes, combined with their geographic footprint, suggest a staggering price tag, both in terms of the human cost and the economic toll,\u201d Moody's analysts wrote. The report did not include a preliminary cost estimate of the wildfire damage.\n\nIt could be several months before a concrete tally of the financial losses from the wildfires will be possible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the very early stages of this disaster,\u201d Porter said."

It is the process by which one of the most important cells that causes inflammatory bowel disease goes wrong.\"\n\nDubbing it a 'holy grail' discovery, he explained that drugs which are already approved for other illnesses such as cancer were able to calm this excessive inflammation - but they need to be tweaked to perfection to target the macrophages.\n\nDr Lee said he hopes that clinical trials will be underway within five years.\n\nAdvert\n\nThey are now keen to set up human trials after realising drugs which already exist seem to reverse the disease in laboratory experiments - so it's looking up for those with IBD.\n\nIf you didn't know, around half a million people in the UK are suffering from some form of inflammatory bowel disease, but Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both the most common.\n\nSufferers typically experience symptoms such as diarrhoea, stomach pain or cramps, blood in their poo, bleeding from their bottom, fatigue and excessive weight loss without trying.\n\nThere's obviously a big overlap between the signs of IBD and other similar conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but you can differentiate between the two as IBD causes inflammation in the bowels.\n\nAccording to the NHS website at the time of writing, it is 'not clear' what causes the disease, but it 'happens when your immune system attacks your bowel, which causes it to get inflamed'.\n\nWell, it\u2019s time to update the website as now it\u2019s very much clear."
