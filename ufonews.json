        "article_content": "Do you fondly remember playing 8-bit adventures on the NES and original Sega consoles? Titles like Contra, Ninja Gaiden, and Mega Man 2, all from the late \u201880s, provided a unique gaming experience that\u2019s hard to replicate today with modern technology. Hard, sure, but it\u2019s possible\u2014as we\u2019ve now witnessed firsthand with the release of UFO 50.\n\n\n\nThe collection\u2014presented as a lost collection from a forgotten developer of the era\u2014features an assortment of single- and multiplayer games across multiple genres, from platformers to roguelikes, with even a few in-depth RPGs mixed in. All are created with an 8-bit retro style that harkens back to the days of gaming in your living room after school. You can beat some of the games in mere minutes, then move on to the next; others, however, require a few hours and multiple playthroughs. They\u2019re all unique, many of them are memorable, and some deserve no more than a single run-through.\n\nWhen we sifted through the Steam user reviews, we found an overwhelmingly positive reception from the gaming community. Most people love the indie retro collection and cannot praise the fun factor enough. As you\u2019ll see below, nostalgia plays a significant role in many of the reviews. Numerous players gave a thumbs up because it felt like playing a game from their childhood, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with feeling young again and enjoying your hobby!\n\nBut a few couldn\u2019t get past many titles, which lack the quality-of-life features in modern gaming, or--they say--feel outdated and unnecessarily complex just for nostalgia\u2019s sake. Despite the positive reviews, the negative ones prove highly negative. Many curse out the game and its developers; they shout from the rooftops about how unfun they thought most of the retro titles were to play.\n\nSurprisingly, we didn\u2019t find many meme reviews, just plenty of positive or negative reviews to help you better understand the game. Here is UFO 50, as told by Steam reviews!\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\n.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

        "article_content": "At first not many were using Google's NotebookLM to take notes. But it's been receiving more attention since it added a feature letting users create an audio summary of files in a conversational, podcast-like format featuring one male and one female voice. Zacharie Scheurer/dpa\n\nA previously little known Google-created AI research and note-taking tool has \u201creally taken off\u201d after it added an audio feature which turned notes into podcast-like audio and the results went viral, one of its product managers has said.\n\nNotebookLM was first released last year as an AI tool to help users interact with their documents \u2013 allowing them to upload a range of files and get summaries and explanations based on that content.\n\nBut the app has begun receiving more mainstream public attention in recent weeks after it added a feature called Audio Overviews, which enabled users to create an audio summary of their upload files, but in a conversational, podcast-like format featuring one male and one female voice.\n\nVarious results from using the tool quickly circulated online and brought new users to the app.\n\nNow Raiza Martin, a product manager at Google Labs and one of the people leading the build of NotebookLM, says users are hungry for more editing control over the type of Audio Overviews they can create with the tool.\n\n\u201cThis is such an exciting time, because since we\u2019ve launched it everyone on Twitter and Reddit and even in our Discord is saying \u2018I want the knobs\u2019, particularly for more voices, or \u2018I want to change the length\u2019,\u201d she told the PA news agency.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to change everything, and we\u2019re definitely going to address this. We\u2019re shipping features quickly to give people more control, but we\u2019re trying to be thoughtful about which controls we ship first.\u201d\n\nAn update to NotebookLM has since rolled out, allowing users to tweak which topics or areas from their source notes they would like covered specifically.\n\nMs Martin added: \u201cI always get asked the question \u2018who is the tool for\u2019 or \u2018who is your target audience?\u2019 and most of the time I\u2019ve thought about it in the same way, which is; what is the person\u2019s profession? How are they applying this to their everyday life?.\n\n\u201cAnd I think we were very, very fortunate in that when we launched Notebook as Project Tailwind last year, we just launched the tool with none of those assumptions to try to find out how people would use it.\u201d\n\nShe said this lack of a specific target audience has helped show that the app could be applicable for anyone who \u201cworks on a computer\u201d, particularly when it came to the audio summaries, and the team building the app were already hearing stories of people listening to the Audio Overviews like a podcast to help them digest their notes.\n\n\u201cSpecifically for the audio, I think one of our key insights is that there are a lot of jobs that require you to digest a lot of information \u2013 and not just jobs \u2013 learners, students of all ages, educators\u2026 basically, if you\u2019re working on a computer, this is the sort of thing you could probably find utility in,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from a lot of people that the way they use it is to listen to the audio first and then write their own questions down, and that had me thinking what a magical harmony between people, technology, information, knowledge, and I think we\u2019re just at the starting line of what this can do.\u201d\n\nNotebookLM has not had the high-profile launch of Google\u2019s flagship AI assistant, Gemini, which powers NotebookLM, but Ms Martin said the newfound fame the note-taking tool had found meant this \u201ctrue experimental product for Google\u201d was getting a more serious product road-map.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ll say in terms of how we\u2019re approaching the continuing rollout is that I think we\u2019ve learned a lot in the last year; what is really resonating with people, what is really useful, how they\u2019re using it every day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that the way we want to keep pushing forward is to really stabilise the experience, and there\u2019s still a lot of work to do to try to connect this to everyday people and make it really relevant.\n\n\u201cSo I think that while the feature work that we\u2019re doing is exciting, I think now is the right time to also start addressing how do we make it so much easier to use.\n\n\u201cBecause for better or worse, that\u2019s not where a lot of our attention has been, but now that we have a lot more interest, a lot more users, let\u2019s make it a lot easier.\u201d"

Find out more about how we test.\n\nPush Two minute review\n\nAfter an entire year as my fitness companion, PUSH Workout & Gym Tracker has become an indispensable part of my training regime. PUSH is the brainchild of fitness influencer and YouTuber Joe Delaney , and is designed to do one thing extremely well. It\u2019s an app made to help you build muscle as quickly as possible, using AI-powered workout routines, strict exercise tracking, and measured progressive overload.\n\nThe first thing you notice about PUSH is its sleek and well-built interface. Workout and fitness apps can often be a cacophony of bright colors, images, text, and numbers everywhere, but not so with PUSH. You can tell that real effort has gone into the user interface and the experience of using the app. The fonts, menus, and icons are all well-thought-out, spacious yet comprehensive. There are just a few colors set against the white background, a traffic-light system helps signal progress, PBs, and plateaus at just a glance.\n\nWhen using PUSH for the first time, you\u2019ll be asked to generate a workout plan. Plans are flexible, but range between three and six sessions a week. You also get to pick your preferred split (gym lingo for your sequence of training sessions), choosing between either \"full-body\" sessions or \"push-pull-legs\". The latter is more familiar to most gymgoers, but the former is the most optimal split, with muscles grouped together to minimize crossover fatigue.\n\nYou\u2019ll also be asked about your sleep and stress levels, training experience, and muscles to focus, before finally the level of equipment available to you. You can even substitute certain exercises from your plan before you start, and over time the app will make recommendations if you generate new plans, so as increasing or decreasing your workout frequency. The plan generation software is really simple and easy to use, so you always feel like you get the right program for you.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got your program, it\u2019s time to get started. You can view upcoming workouts and scroll between days to see what\u2019s on the agenda, giving you a nice overview of how the week is panning out. You\u2019ll probably be surprised to find a pretty diverse mix of exercises over the course of your week. You\u2019ll often find yourself training legs, back, shoulders, chest, arms, core, and more on the same day or together in ways you might not expect, but it\u2019s all part of the optimization process at the heart of PUSH. A bit unfamiliar at first, I\u2019ve definitely felt the benefits of switching up my training routine and spreading the load more evenly across different muscle groups.\n\n(Image credit: Future / PUSH)\n\nWorkouts are broken down into phases, so you\u2019ll start with a strength phase of high-weight, low-reps, with three or more minutes of rest. Then you move on to stabilized compounds like lateral pulldowns, before ending with a pump phase of lower weight, higher reps, and reduced rest. For each exercise, you\u2019ll get very clearly marked target weights and reps, and you simply tick the box by tapping on it with your thumb to mark off a set and start your rep timer. You can manually adjust the entries if you fall short of your target reps, or you lift more weight than listed in the app.\n\nOver time, the AI will track your progress, and it'll eventually suggest a new weight or an increased number of reps. This will become clearer over time as you use the app, but it\u2019s highly motivating and gives you an amazing sense of progress. If you stall, it\u2019ll recommend a \"plateau breaker\" exercise, or you can attempt the exercise again. You can also switch out exercises on the fly during workouts, too.\n\nThe app presents progress over your last seven days, highlighting muscles that are likely growing or stalling, which can help you refocus your efforts as you exercise. Each exercise is accompanied by a helpful animated guide video, although beginners might find the lack of instructions a bit daunting.\n\nThere are a couple of quirks to using PUSH. I don\u2019t love that there\u2019s no volume control for the rest timer. It\u2019s tied to the volume of your music (at least on iPhone), so the louder your music or podcast, the louder the beep at the end of your rest period. The AI also isn\u2019t infallible; recently I plateaued at a 100kg bench press, and the AI suggested I try a plateau breaker of 1002.5 kg, instead of 102.5kg.\n\nIt feels unfair to mark the app down for only serving one purpose, however, prospective users should be aware that PUSH is only tailored towards building muscle mass in the gym. You won\u2019t find any Pilates, mobility, cardio, or any other discipline here: this is purely strength-based. The only other possible drawback is the price: at $89.99 / \u00a389.99 / AU$144.99 , the yearly subscription is a big commitment, and some people might find the monthly cost too much to stomach compared to the price of, say, Apple Fitness Plus or Fitbod.\n\nGenerally, however, the app has been a joy to use in the 12 months that I\u2019ve been a customer and is well worth the financial investment. And there\u2019s more to come, creator Delaney has teased changes coming to the app on his Instagram , so there\u2019s never been a better time to get on board with what is undoubtedly one of the best fitness apps on the market.\n\nPush: Price and availability\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThe Push app is available globally on Apple\u2019s App Store for iPhone and the Google Play Store for Android. There\u2019s a brief free trial available, after which you\u2019ll pay $89.99/\u00a389.99/$AU$144.99 a year or $15.49/\u00a314.99/AU$23.49 a month to use it.\n\nPush: Specifications\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Platforms: iOS (Tested), Android Price: $89.99/\u00a389.99/AU$144.99 a year or $15.49/\u00a314.99/AU$23.49 a month Pairs with device: iPhone or Android smartphone Guided content: AI-powered muscle and strength workouts Video content: Exercise Guidance\n\n(Image credit: Future / PUSH)\n\nPush: Scorecard\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Category Comment Score Value Definitely on the pricey end when it comes to fitness apps, but I\u2019ve found it invaluable. 4/5 Design The design of this app is arguably its greatest feature, the interface is a joy to use and makes tracking workouts a delight. 5/5 Features Very strong AI-powered program generation, workout and rest tracking, and a collection of peer-reviewed literature. 5/5 Performance Strong overall, but AI progressive overload can sometimes be quirky, and there\u2019s no volume control for the rest timer. 4.5/5 Total A brilliantly designed app with very few flaws. 4.5/5\n\nPush: Should I buy?\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nBuy if it...\n\nYou want to build muscle in the gym This is one of the purest fitness apps on the market for building muscle mass.\n\nYou want a structured workout tracker with progressive overload PUSH excels at tracking your workout progress and keeping you focused during sessions.\n\nDon't buy it if...\n\nYou want a free or cheap workout app PUSH is more expensive than other options on the market.\n\nYou want a fitness app for anything other than muscle-building PUSH does not include any other type of exercise or nutrition guidance.\n\nAlso consider\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Push Apple Fitness Plus Fitbod Platforms: iOS, Android (Tested) iPhone, iPad, Apple TV iOS and Android Price: $89.99/\u00a389.99/$AU$144.99 a year or $15.49/\u00a314.99/$23.49 a month $9.99 / \u00a39.99 / AU$14.99 per month $12.99 / approximately \u00a310 / AU$20 per month Pairs with device: iPhone or Android smartphone Apple Watch Phone, companion app available for Apple Watch.

I\u2019ve generated multiple fresh plans to follow, and have used its features over the course of an entire year by performing a daily workout with the help of the app. All of my testing was done on an iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPhone 16 Pro Max."

Did you hear that?\u201d McLean reacts.\n\nIt\u2019s someone working upstairs, mostly likely.\n\nBut maybe not.\n\nPresentation House Theatre is one of the oldest buildings on the North Shore and, according to the Vancouver Paranormal Society, likely one of the most haunted.\n\nResearchers from the society are preparing to share the findings of their investigation into spirits who still dwell in the theatre at a one-night show scheduled for Oct. 29.\n\nGhosts in the machines\n\nLeah McLean and Mike O\u2019Dell of the Vancouver Paranormal Society scan for paranormal activity at North Vancouver\u2019s Presentation House Theatre. The group will present their findings at a one-night show on Oct. 29. | Paul McGrath / North Shore News\n\nSearching for proof of an afterlife here on earth doesn\u2019t involve a s\u00e9ance or a Ouija board. Instead, paranormal researchers prefer more sophisticated tools \u2013 night vision cameras and infrared spectrum lighting, proximity sensors that emit light if something interrupts the electromagnetic field around them, devices that scan radio frequencies for unexplainable interruptions.\n\nThe most important piece of equipment though is a simple digital voice recorder that the investigators say is capable of capturing voices that our naked ears can\u2019t hear. More than passively listening or scanning for activity on their instruments, investigators like McLean speak out to the seemingly empty room and find answers only when they\u2019re analyzing their recordings at home.\n\nAll of it is based on the theory that, even after a person has died, there remains a spirit that is tangible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all made up of energy, right? And that energy of ours is housed in our body, but when we no longer have a body, we\u2019re in a spirit form. We\u2019re just energy,\u201d Kelly Berge, president of the Vancouver Paranormal Society, explains.\n\nRather than attributing every flicker of light or bit of static on the radio to a presence from beyond the dead, they first look for corroborating evidence from their other instruments.\n\nOther times \u2013 rarely \u2013 our own senses are enough to do the job.\n\nBerge said she\u2019s always felt since she was just a kiddo that there was something more beyond the corporeal. As she was peering into her closet one night when she was about 10, she got all the proof she\u2019d need for a lifetime.\n\n\u201cI saw a floating opalescent skull. You know when you do that thing where you rub your eyes and you look again, and it was still there,\u201d she said. \u201cI never slept in that room again, but that experience stuck with me.\u2026 I always knew I wanted to figure this out.\u201d\n\nTypically, at least three or four of the non-profit\u2019s team of 11 volunteers are out every weekend carrying out investigations on behalf of clients who\u2019ve requested them. Importantly, the team never charges a fee of any kind, Berge notes.\n\nMost of their work comes from residential homeowners who want to know what\u2019s making things go bump in the night, but it\u2019s the public buildings with long histories that offer the most promise.\n\nThanks to rumours already swirling about it in the community, Presentation House Theatre had long been near the top of the list of places that the team was itching to get into, Berge said.\n\nPresentation House Theatre\u2019s haunting inhabitants\n\nPresentation House Theatre in North Vancouver. | Alanna Kelly / North Shore News\n\nThe building itself dates back to 1902 when it was built as a school. It later became the City of North Vancouver\u2019s municipal hall, a police station and jail, and offices for the city\u2019s engineering department before finally becoming a museum and arts facility in the 1970s.\n\nAraceli Ferrara, marketing co-ordinator for Presentation House Theatre, said she began hearing about the building\u2019s ghosts on her first day of work, and she\u2019s tagged along with the investigators on all of their visits.\n\nActors have reported feeling a strange presence while backstage. One of the technicians has heard the sound of footsteps sprinting toward him while working alone late at night. Once, after one of his gloves went missing on the job, it turned up the next day folded neatly in the middle of the set. And everyone gets \u201cbad vibes\u201d from the third floor, Ferrara said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely seen a few things,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been here past midnight. I don\u2019t want to be.\u201d\n\nInvestigators have made five official visits to the theatre since 2023, with more planned in the future.\n\n\u201cEvery time we come, we get more and more confirmation that there\u2019s something here. So, we just keep coming back,\u201d said McLean, one of the Paranormal Society\u2019s volunteers.\n\nUntil the recent investigations, the most authoritative source on paranormal activity at Presentation House Theatre was the word of Cecil Halsey, the building\u2019s caretaker for more than 25 years. Halsey, who sometimes slept in the 122-year-old building, was well acquainted with Frank, one of the most frequently encountered spirits there.\n\nBerge said they found plenty of evidence that Frank is still there and that he is \u201ckind of inappropriate.\u201d\n\nHe likes whiskey, they learned, and among the phrases they captured him saying were \u201cbad and beautiful\u201d and \u201cshut up, bitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are usually the same personality in death and spirit as they were in life,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just being a jerk. He\u2019s being who he was in real life, but he\u2019s not going to harm me. He\u2019s not going to harm the staff.\u2026 It\u2019s not like those TV shows where everything is demonic and all that. That\u2019s extremely, extremely rare.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean though that wayward spirits can\u2019t still send a chill down the spine of even a seasoned paranormal researcher. On their last visit to Presentation House, the batteries in the team\u2019s cameras all died simultaneously and unexpectedly. Moments later, Berge saw an apparition in the very seats where Presentation House\u2019s guests pay to sit.\n\n\u201cI saw a black shadow figure, very stark, crouch down and lean into the aisle chair, and then it was gone,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was something that shouldn\u2019t have been there.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also another spirit of a younger girl on the third floor, according to the team. And it appears as though there's someone new to keep Frank company: the old caretaker Halsey died in 2019, but he identified himself, albeit faintly, to the investigators at the theatre, Berge said.\n\nI ain\u2019t afraid of no ghosts\n\nLeah McLean and Mike O'Dell, investigators with the Vancouver Paranormal Society, listen for activity in North Vancouver's Presentation House Theatre. | Alanna Kelly / North Shore News\n\nWhether it\u2019s in a home or place of business, more than anything after an investigation, clients get some peace of mind, Berge said.\n\n\u201cPeace of mind, and (knowing) they\u2019re not crazy. They weren\u2019t making this up in their heads. They did experience these things, as did we, and that is a huge thing,\u201d she said.\n\nKnowing you have a spirit present is one thing. But ghosts, she added, are not in need of \"busting.\" Instead, some frank communication (no pun intended) is probably what\u2019s most needed \u2013 letting the spirit know that the living inhabitants of today have a right to be there and that everyone can coexist harmoniously.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give the client a tool to be strong and to take their power back in their home. And quite often, when that happens and they\u2019re feeling more settled, the activity tends to settle down a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the things I always say is ghosts are people too. They\u2019re just further along in the journey than we are, but we\u2019re going to be there someday, right? So we have to come with the utmost respect.\u201d\n\nDo you believe?\n\nRunning into skeptics comes with the territory, and Berge acknowledges none of the evidence they\u2019ve collected will be enough to meet some people\u2019s standards. But, she added, those who are committed to their closed-mindedness are robbing themselves of the possibility that there may be something else \u201cout there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t certify it as haunted, because we\u2019re dealing with a science that isn\u2019t recognized by mainstream science, right? So the jury\u2019s still out, because there is no definable proof,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced it over hundreds of investigations, but they still just make up their mind so they\u2019re not open. And that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nAnd more people are closer to believing in the paranormal than might be prepared to admit, suggests Mike O\u2019Dell, another of the Vancouver Paranormal Society's volunteer investigators.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s skeptics out there \u2013 I\u2019m one of them \u2013 and people who don\u2019t believe in this, and that\u2019s fine.\u2026 But for me, it\u2019s when I can\u2019t apply logic or science to something that makes me go \u2018hmm,\u2019 and if I can\u2019t explain something, then that\u2019s the definition of paranormal,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say 99 per cent of the time, it\u2019s just an entity or an energy that wants to be acknowledged, wants to communicate, wants to say \u2018Hi,\u2019 and just wants to live in peace.\u201d\n\nThis is a busy time of year for the Vancouver Paranormal Society. Around Halloween, people are more willing to explore the big questions that ghost stories pose about the nature of mortality. Or they just want to have some good, clean seasonal fun and have the wits scared out of them in the process.\n\n\u201cPeople, especially around Halloween, are very interested in the paranormal. They want to know if it\u2019s true or not. They want to have that little bit of a thrill and some people may have had their own experiences,\u201d Berge said.\n\nBecause of that innate desire to know the unknowable, Ferrara said she expects the Haunted Histories show to be a hit for the true believers, the skeptics and those caught between worlds.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of interest in death. I know it\u2019s macabre, but, because there\u2019s a stigma around it, we don\u2019t talk about it as openly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to delve into something that you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHaunted Histories: An Evening with the Vancouver Paranormal Society runs Tuesday, Oct. 29, 7:30 p.m. at Presentation House Theatre. Tickets are available at phtheatre.org/box-office/.\n\n[email protected]\n\ntwitter.com/brentrichter\n\n- video by Alanna Kelly, Glacier Media"

Vier Jahreszeiten Kempinski Munchen, Germany\n\nVier Jahreszeiten Kempinski Munchen/Booking.com\n\nThis grand historic hotel in Munich dates all the way back to 1858, and has gained a reputation for ghostly sightings, particularly that of a 'lady in white'. Seen wandering through the hallways and staircases by both guests and staff, her ghost is believed to be linked to a tragic love story from the 19th century, though the exact details of her identity remain unclear.\n\n25. Vier Jahreszeiten Kempinski Munchen, Germany\n\nVier Jahreszeiten Kempinski Munchen/Booking.com\n\nSightings of the 'lady in white' haven't done anything to harm the hotel's popularity. Over the years Vier Jahreszeiten Kempinski Munchen has hosted royalty, politicians and celebrities looking to enjoy the range of top-class amenities on offer \u2013 including a rooftop pool with panoramic city views. It's no wonder that even the ghosts don't want to leave.\n\n24. Hotel Alfonso XIII, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Seville, Spain\n\nHotel Alfonso XIII, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Seville, Spain/Booking.com\n\nHotel Alfonso XIII in Seville, one of Spain\u2019s most iconic luxury hotels, is not just famous for its grandeur but also its ghostly reputation. Built in 1929, this 5-star hotel exudes timeless elegance, but lurking behind its opulent decor are eerie tales of supernatural encounters.

Hotel Alfonso XIII, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Seville, Spain\n\nHotel Alfonso XIII, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Seville, Spain/Booking.com\n\nOne of the eeriest occurrences is the frequent feeling of a ghostly presence in certain rooms, where visitors have described strange noises, sudden drops in temperature and an overwhelming sense of being watched.

Burghotel auf Sch\u00f6nburg, Germany\n\nBurghotel auf Sch\u00f6nburg/Booking.com\n\nPerched high above the Rhine River in Oberwesel, Germany, this stunning medieval castle-turned-hotel harbours a rich history of hauntings. Dating back to the 12th century, the castle has seen countless battles, betrayals and tragedies, all of which are believed to have left an imprint on the property. Guests have reported eerie encounters with the ghost of a knight, who is said to wander the halls, armour clinking and occasionally appear in rooms. Legend has it that he perished defending the castle, and is now eternally bound to its walls.\n\n23.

Ch\u00e2teau de Brissac, France\n\nCh\u00e2teau de Brissac/Booking.com\n\nLocated in the Loire Valley of France, The Ch\u00e2teau de Brissac is as famous for its ghostly inhabitant as it is for being the tallest ch\u00e2teau in the country. The castle, which dates back to the 11th century and was rebuilt in the 17th century, is said to be haunted by the spirit of Charlotte de Br\u00e9z\u00e9, known as the 'Green Lady'. According to legend, Charlotte, the illegitimate daughter of King Charles VII, was murdered in the castle by her husband, Jacques de Br\u00e9z\u00e9, after discovering her affair. Since then, her spirit is said to roam the halls dressed in green, with a particularly ghastly face \u2013 her ghostly presence has unsettled both guests and the current owners alike.\n\n22.

Gran Hotel Ciudad de M\u00e9xico Z\u00f3calo, M\u00e9xico\n\nGran Hotel Ciudad de M\u00e9xico Z\u00f3calo/Booking.com\n\nIn the heart of M\u00e9xico City\u2019s historic Z\u00f3calo district, this stunning hotel, dating back to 1899, boasts one of the largest Tiffany stained-glass ceilings in the world. However, behind its elegant fa\u00e7ade, ghostly figures are said to lurk. Guests and staff have reported seeing shadowy apparitions and experiencing unexplained phenomena, especially in the hallways and certain rooms. These hauntings are believed to be connected to the hotel\u2019s long history and its location on the Z\u00f3calo, an area filled with centuries of tumultuous events and transformations.\n\n21. Gran Hotel Ciudad de M\u00e9xico Z\u00f3calo, M\u00e9xico\n\nGran Hotel Ciudad de M\u00e9xico Z\u00f3calo/Booking.com\n\nOne of the most famous ghostly sightings involves the figure of a man who has been seen wandering the corridors late at night. Some say he is the spirit of a former guest or possibly tied to the city\u2019s past, given the hotel's location near significant historical sites. Others have reported strange noises, sudden drops in temperature and an eerie feeling of being watched while staying at the hotel.\n\n20. Toftaholm Herrg\u00e5rd, Sweden\n\nToftaholm Herrg\u00e5rd/Facebook\n\nLapped by Lake Vid\u00f6stern, this former 14th-century manor house in southern Sweden looks perfectly idyllic. But as with many historic hotels, it's riddled with rumours of spooky goings-on. Numerous guests have reported hearing chilling noises at night and seeing windows seemingly open by themselves. Rumour has it that the charming hotel is haunted by the ghost of a young man who hung himself here after his love, the daughter of the baron who owned the house, was forced to marry another.\n\n20. Toftaholm Herrg\u00e5rd, Sweden\n\nToftaholm Herrg\u00e5rd/Facebook\n\nJ\u00f6ns Sk\u00f6tta, the founder of Toftaholm, transformed it into a manor house upon becoming nobility. His grandson later fortified the property, integrating it into Sweden\u2019s defence system against Denmark. According to legend, an underground passage once connected the fort to the northern wing of the manor house, adding to its intriguing history. Today, the hotel attracts visitors with its country house charm and picturesque lakeside spa, while also embracing its eerie past by hosting regular murder mystery evenings.\n\n19. Fairmont Banff Springs, Alberta, Canada\n\nJeff Whyte/Shutterstock\n\nThe majestic and isolated Fairmont Banff Springs, nestled in Canada\u2019s Rocky Mountains, is known for its eerie tales. Most ghosts are said to haunt the public areas, with many being friendly \u2013 especially Sam the bellman, who is often spotted in period attire greeting guests. Built in 1888 as one of Canada's first grand railway hotels, it was later rebuilt in Scottish baronial style after a fire in 1926.\n\n19. Fairmont Banff Springs, Alberta, Canada\n\nFairmont Banff Springs/Facebook\n\nAnother haunting apparition at the hotel is said to be the spirit of a doomed 1930s bride. Legend has it that her dress caught fire from a candle as she descended a winding stone staircase to celebrate her wedding in the grand ballroom. Her tragic spectre has been seen moving up and down the stairs and floating through the ballroom in her wedding gown. The hotel's resident historian is well-versed in sharing these eerie tales with curious visitors.\n\n18. Lord Milner Hotel, South Africa\n\nCourtesy of Lord Milner Hotel\n\nBuilt by Scotsman James Logan in 1884 and named after the governor of the Cape at the time, the Lord Milner Hotel is reportedly riddled with spooks and spectres. The stunning building was used as a military hospital during the Anglo-Boer War with its turrets functioning as enemy lookouts. The hotel apparently has a long-term resident ghost nurse from this era called Katie, who likes to play cards at night in her room.\n\n18. Lord Milner Hotel, South Africa\n\nCourtesy of Lord Milner Hotel\n\nOn the other hand, the ghost of Lucy \u2013 who died here during the Anglo-Boer war \u2013 likes to roam around and is apparently fond of rattling guests' door knobs at night. Lady Milner, meanwhile, is also often seen wafting about the place in her long white dress. Beyond these eerie tales, the historic hotel is also a charming destination for those looking to experience the old-world atmosphere of the Victorian-era town of Matjiesfontein. This small, heritage-listed spa town lies on the edge of South Africa's vast and remote Karoo region, offering a unique blend of history and haunting intrigue.\n\n17. Ettington Park Hotel, England, UK\n\nCourtesy of Handpicked Hotels\n\nGuests may be in for some unexpected company when sipping their aperitif on the veranda in this grand Warwickshire hotel. Lady Emma, the country pile\u2019s most frequently spotted ghost, likes to lurk about here at dusk. Thought to be the ghost of a former governess at the manor house, she\u2019s also known to glide along the corridors of Ettington Park Hotel at night in her long white gown before vanishing into the walls.\n\n17. Ettington Park Hotel, England, UK\n\nCourtesy of Handpicked Hotels\n\nOwned by one of Warwickshire\u2019s oldest families for years, the Shirleys, Ettington Park became a nursing home in 1935 and later a prisoner of war camp. After an extensive fire in 1979, the building was derelict for several years before being restored and reopening as a hotel in the 1980s. It\u2019s not surprising that with such an intriguing past, the house is surrounded by tales of ghostly goings-on. Sightings include the apparition of a monk within the hotel\u2019s extensive grounds, which feature an old Norman chapel, and two young boys from the Shirley family who drowned in the nearby Stour River in the 1800s.\n\n16. Ruthin Castle Hotel & Spa, Wales, UK\n\nRuthin Castle Hotel & Spa/Facebook\n\nWith stone lions guarding its doors and preening peacocks roaming its parklands, this formidable fort in north Wales makes for a grand getaway. Steeped in grim tales of bloody battles and betrayals, the castle was originally known as The Red Castle in the Great Marsh. Built in 1277 for King Edward I by Dafydd, the brother of Prince Llewellyn ap Gruffudd, it was part of Edward\u2019s effort to control Wales. Despite his loyalty, Dafydd was later executed for high treason after being captured by Reginald de Grey, who was subsequently granted control of Ruthin Castle.\n\n16. Ruthin Castle Hotel & Spa, Wales, UK\n\nRuthin Castle Hotel & Spa/Facebook\n\nAmong the 13th-century ruins of the original castle are the remains of its dungeons, a drowning pool and whipping pit. Along with harrowing tales of tortured prisoners, it\u2019s said the spurned spectre of Lady Grey has haunted the halls, chambers and battlements of Castle Ruthin ever since she was put to death for murdering her husband\u2019s mistress. Other spectral sightings reported by guests of the now gentile country escape include the shadowy figures of a little girl and a soldier.\n\n15. Jekyll Island Club Resort, Georgia, USA\n\nJekyll Island Club Resort/Facebook\n\nThe Jekyll Island Club was founded in 1886 by members of an exclusive hunting and recreational club, who purchased the barrier island as a private retreat. During the early 20th century, it flourished, attracting some of America's wealthiest families, including the Morgans, Rockefellers and Vanderbilts. The club remained a social hotspot for decades before falling on hard times during the Great Depression and World War II. In 1948, the state of Georgia purchased the island and opened it as a park. The hotel\u2019s clubhouse was later restored and reopened as the luxurious Jekyll Island Club Resort in 1987.\n\n15. Jekyll Island Club Resort, Georgia, USA\n\nJoanne Dale/Shutterstock\n\nThe hotel and wider historic isle, which has National Historic Landmark District status, are said to be rife with lingering spirits. One of its most famous ghost stories revolves around Edwin Gould's son, who tragically died in a hunting accident on the island in 1917. He was known for bringing roses to his grandmother at Cherokee Cottage, where guests today still claim to smell the faint scent of flowers at dusk, the time of his death. Another well-known apparition is that of a bellman, who is often spotted on the hotel\u2019s second floor. For those interested in the paranormal, the resort hosts an annual ghost-hunting weekend, complete with tours led by a paranormal researcher.\n\n14. The Jamaica Inn, England, UK\n\nCourtesy of Jamaica Inn\n\nThis isolated old coaching inn on Cornwall's bleak and treacherous Bodmin Moor claims to be one of England's most haunted pubs. Horses' hooves are often heard late at night on Jamaica Inn's cobblestones and a man in a tricorne hat has been witnessed striding through doors. Strange voices can sometimes be heard whispering about the place too, in what\u2019s thought to be old Cornish.\n\n14. The Jamaica Inn, England, UK\n\nCourtesy of Jamaica Inn\n\nBuilt in 1750, this historic inn was once a notorious hub for smugglers, using hidden moorland tunnels beneath Bodmin Moor to move contraband across the West Country. It famously inspired Daphne du Maurier\u2019s novel Jamaica Inn, set amidst Cornish pirates and smugglers, and today houses a museum that delves into the darker side of Cornwall\u2019s history, also featuring the author's original writing desk.\n\n13. The Stanley Hotel, Colorado, USA\n\nStanley Hotel/Facebook\n\nImmersed in the wilds of Colorado\u2019s Estes Park, the secluded Stanley Hotel opened in 1909 as a grand mountain retreat for wealthy urbanites. It still draws guests with its old-world charm \u2013 its grand lobby has vast fireplaces, an elegant staircase and original ornate brass elevator \u2013 but it's also a magnet for ghost hunters. Famous as the inspiration for Stephen King\u2019s haunted hotel in The Shining, this Colorado institution has spooky stories by the book-full. The fourth floor in particular is said to be oppressive with the presence of spirits \u2013 the sound of balls bouncing down the hallway and ghostly giggles have been heard in the dead of night.\n\n13. The Stanley Hotel, Colorado, USA\n\nCourtesy of The Stanley\n\nRoom 217, where Stephen King and his wife stayed during a snowy night \u2013 sparking his inspiration for the ominous Overlook Hotel \u2013 is said to be the most haunted room. Legend has it that a housekeeper who tragically died on the hotel grounds still lingers there. Other popular rooms for ghost hunters include 401, 407, 428 and 1302, each with its own eerie reputation. The Stanley Hotel offers guided ghost tours for those not scared easily, giving visitors a chance to explore its haunted history and infamous paranormal activity.\n\n12. Skirrid Mountain Inn, Wales, UK\n\nLiquid Light/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nDating back to the 12th century, The Skirrid Mountain Inn is one of the oldest pubs in Wales and is believed to be deeply haunted. The inn has a grisly history, having once been used as a courthouse where criminals were sentenced to death by hanging. The spirits of those hanged, as well as other apparitions, are said to roam the inn.

        "source": "Popular Science",
        "article_content": "For the first time, physicists have observed a \u201cblack hole triple\u201d in space. This new system is about 8,000 light years away from Earth and is made up of a central black hole that is in the act of consuming a small star spiraling very close to it. Surprisingly, a second star appears to also be circling the central black hole, but much further away. The discovery is described in a study published October 23 in the journal Nature.\n\nHitting a triple\n\nMost of the black holes that scientists have detected appear to be part of a pair called a binary system. These systems are made up of the black hole and a secondary object like a star, much denser neutron star, or another black hole. The binary system then spirals around each other and are drawn together by the black hole\u2019s gravity.\n\nFor this new black hole triple, there is an additional object orbiting the central black hole. The closer star orbits the black hole about every 6.5 days. The authors estimate that the more far-off companion orbits the black hole every 70,000 years.\n\n[Related: The hunt for the first stars in the universe.]\n\nThat a black hole appears to have a gravitational hold on an object that is so far away is raising some questions about the origins of this black hole itself. Scientists believe that black holes form from a supernova\u2013the violent explosion of a dying star. During a supernova, a star releases a huge amount of energy and light in one final burst before it collapses into an invisible black hole.\n\nIf this newly-observed black hole resulted from a typical supernova, the energy it would have released before it ultimately collapsed would have kicked away any more loosely bound objects orbiting on its outskirts. In theory, that second outer star shouldn\u2019t still be hanging around.\n\nThe team believes that the black hole formed through a more gentle process instead\u2013direct collapse. During direct collapse, a star simply caves in on itself and forms a black hole without that last dramatic burst. A gentle origin like this wouldn\u2019t really disturb any loosely bound, faraway objects.\n\nSince the new triple system includes a very far-off star, the system\u2019s black hole was potentially born through that gentler direct collapse. While astronomers have been observing violent supernovae for centuries, this new triple system may be the first evidence of a black hole that formed from this more gentle process.\n\n\u201cWe think most black holes form from violent explosions of stars, but this discovery helps call that into question,\u201d study co-author and MIT physicist Kevin Burdge said in a statement. \u201cThis system is super exciting for black hole evolution, and it also raises questions of whether there are more triples out there.\u201d\n\nChance discovery\n\nThis discovery also came about almost by chance. The physicists found it while looking through a repository of astronomical observations taken by telescopes in space and around the world called Aladin Lite. They used Aladin Lite to search for images of the same part of the sky, taken by different telescopes tuned to various wavelengths of energy and light.\n\nOriginally, they were looking within the Milky Way galaxy for signs of new black holes. Out of curiosity, Burdge reviewed an image of V404 Cygni, a black hole roughly 8,000 light years from Earth. In 1992, V404 Cygni became one of the very first objects in space to be confirmed as a black. Since then, it has been documented in over 1,300 scientific papers and is one of our most well-studied black holes. However, none of these studies reported this strange triple system.\n\n[Related: 1.5 billion cosmic objects dazzle in the largest infrared Milky Way map ever created.]\n\nWhile looking at optical images of V404 Cygni, Burdge saw what looked like two blobs of light that were close to one another. The first blob was the black hole and an inner star orbiting close by. That star is so close to the hole that it is releasing some of its material onto the black hole itself and giving off visible light. However, that second blob of light was most likely coming from a very distant star that had not been observed before.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we can see two separate stars over this much distance actually means that the stars have to be really very far apart,\u201d said Burdge.\n\nCalculations found that the outer star is 3,500 astronomical units (AU) away from the black hole. One AU is the distance between Earth and the sun. The outer star is thus 3,500 times further away from the black hole as we are to the sun, or 100 times greater than the distance between Pluto and the sun.\n\nThe team then questioned whether the outer star was linked to both the black hole and its inner star. To find an answer, the team looked to Gaia, the satellite that has been tracking the motions of all the stars in the galaxy for a decade. They analyzed the motions of the inner and outer stars over the past 10 years of Gaia data and found that the stars moved in tandem compared to some of the nearby stars. According to their calculations, the odds of this kind of tandem motion are about one in 10 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly not a coincidence or accident,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing two stars that are following each other because they\u2019re attached by this weak string of gravity. So this has to be a triple system.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s go fly a (space) kite\n\nThe team then wondered how this system could have formed in the first place. The violent explosion of a typical supernova would have kicked that outstar away a very long time ago.\n\n\u201cImagine you\u2019re pulling a kite, and instead of a strong string, you\u2019re pulling with a spider web,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cIf you tugged too hard, the web would break and you\u2019d lose the kite. Gravity is like this barely bound string that\u2019s really weak, and if you do anything dramatic to the inner binary, you\u2019re going to lose the outer star.\u201d\n\nTo test out this kite string theory, Burdge carried out computer simulations to see how this kind of triple system could have evolved and kept the outer star.\n\n[Related: Biggest black hole jets ever seen span 140 Milky Way galaxies.]\n\nAt the beginning of each simulation, he introduced three stars. The third star was the black hole, before it became a black hole. He then ran tens of thousands of simulations. Each simulation had a slightly different scenario for how the third star may have become a black hole and affected the motions of the other two stars. For example, he simulated a supernova and changed the amount of energy and the direction all of that energy traveled in. He also simulated scenarios of direct collapse, where the third star caved in on itself to form a black hole, without sending off any energy.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of simulations show that the easiest way to make this triple work is through direct collapse,\u201d Burdge says.\n\nThis extra outer star also revealed the system\u2019s age. The team observed that the outer star is in the process of becoming a red giant, a phase occurring at the end of a star\u2019s life. They believe that the outerstar is about 4 billion years old, based on this transition. Since the neighboring stars are born around the same time, the team believes that this black hole triple is also 4 billion years old.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been able to do this before for an old black hole,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cNow we know V404 Cygni is part of a triple, it could have formed from direct collapse, and it formed about 4 billion years ago, thanks to this discovery.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Avast One Gold for Mac MSRP $179.99 Score Details \u201cAvast One for Mac offers powerful, free antivirus software with virus scans and browser blocking.\u201d Pros Excellent malware protection record\n\nUser-friendly app\n\nCustomizable plans\n\n24/7 live support\n\nFree app includes a VPN Cons Big price increases on renewal\n\nFree VPN has a 5GB/month cap\n\nAvast is an antivirus software developer that supports macOS, and the Avast One package includes extra cybersecurity features that go beyond simple malware scans. Antivirus, ransomware protection, malware blocking, and more are available in free and paid subscription plans.\n\nA few months ago, I reviewed Avast One for Windows and found it to be a good solution. However, the Mac is a very different computer with unique hardware and software, so I tested Avast One for Mac to find out if it\u2019s a good fit for Apple\u2019s system and one of the best antivirus apps for your Mac.\n\nSpecs\n\nAvast One Platforms Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android Devices 5 (individual), 30 (family) Support Chat, email Price $180 Free version? Yes\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nAvast One\u2019s website describes its free tier as Basic, but the documentation refers to it as Avast One Essential. Either way, it\u2019s powerful antivirus software that protects your Mac for free. You get a malware scanner and browser protection to block malicious downloads. A free VPN is included but the monthly data is restricted to 5GB. Avast One offers one of the best free Mac antivirus apps available.\n\nIf you subscribe, more features are unlocked, and you can pick from three price tiers and a few variations. Avast One Silver starts at $36 annually with a choice of more protection, privacy, or performance features. Renewal costs are significantly higher than the first year, jumping to $80 in year two and beyond. You can get all three feature packs at once with the $60 Avast One Gold ($130 renewal).\n\nAvast One comes in family plans as well. For $84/$180, Avast One Silver Family increases the number of supported devices from the standard five to a generous 30, enough for everyone to enjoy protection. Avast One Gold Family costs $114/$280 to cover 30 devices.\n\nThe top tier is Avast One Platinum for $120/$300, a relatively minor increase from Avast One Gold Family that adds identity protection, dark web monitoring, and $2 million in identity theft insurance.\n\nDesign\n\nInstalling Avast One was simple, and much easier than my experience with McAfee\u2019s antivirus for Mac. After downloading the installer, a Finder window opened with a message to double-click it. After agreeing to the terms of use and allowing the required permissions, the installer placed itself in the trash and launched Avast One for setup.\n\nI started with the free version, Avast One Essential, initially skipping the sign-in option. The app guided me to enable Avast access in System Settings, opening the appropriate tabs along the way. After a few clicks, everything was ready in about a minute.\n\nI got a friendly message saying \u201cEverything looks good,\u201d but lacking enough details to convince me. I scrolled down to the shortcuts and found an option to run a system scan. The app updated its virus data, checked my browser caches, and scanned for malware. In the final step, it suggested file cleanup, giving me an option to upgrade to use this feature. I declined and moved to the next shortcut, the VPN.\n\nAfter allowing a pop-up approval request from macOS, the free VPN was switched on. It\u2019s capped at 5GB per month, which isn\u2019t enough for daily use, but could be useful for occasional checks or vacation planning.\n\nThe free app shows all the features in the explore tab, but some are locked until I subscribe. Still, plenty are available in Avast One Essential. The system scan checks for malware and includes a VPN, which is capped at 5GB per month.\n\nThe account tab shows my subscription level \u2014 currently none \u2014 and has subsections to set preferences, browse help documents, check the community forums, get support, or uninstall the app. It\u2019s refreshing to see an easy way to uninstall since removing antivirus software is sometimes difficult.\n\nFeatures\n\nAvast for Mac enjoys a near-perfect malware protection record in ongoing evaluations from the independent security research lab AV-Test. In fact, there were only two instances when Avast fell below a perfect six out of six.\n\nIn September 2020, a minor miss dropped AV-Test\u2019s rating to 5.5. The more notable flaw was from six years ago when Avast for Mac failed in 3.7% of the 241 malware tests performed in December 2018.\n\nEvery other quarterly test since December 2017 has been perfect. That\u2019s an impressive protection record that\u2018s almost as good as market leaders Bitdefender and Norton.\n\nWhile I trust AV-Test\u2019s results, I still wanted to spot-check for myself. I visited Wicar\u2019s malware test website to see how good the free web blocker was. Avast One Essential recognized all 13 browser exploits and malware downloads, blocking the danger at every turn.\n\nI tried again with the VPN switched off, and each threat was blocked without using any monthly data to safeguard my browsing. The free app is very good, a generous gift to the often overlooked Mac community.\n\nSwitching the VPN back on, I loaded BrowserLeaks website to check if my IP address was visible. The IP address and location shown were different from mine, so Avast\u2019s free VPN did its job.\n\nWith my Avast One Essential testing complete, I upgraded to Avast One Gold to continue with the subscriber version. That removed all locks on the explore tab, so I used the disk cleaner to free up over 4GB of app caches, trash, and log files.\n\nThere are plenty of extras that help with privacy, protection, and cleaning my Mac. The most important paid features are the uncapped VPN with an option to choose a server in another country to avoid geoblocking and live chat support.\n\nSupport\n\nAs an Avast One Gold subscriber, I requested priority support on the website via live chat. At first, I got a chatbot that misunderstood my question about how Avast One works. A multiple-choice selection let me switch to a live agent who immediately took over. After being speedy at first, the second response was much slower, and I had to repeat what I told the chatbot.\n\nIt was a bit frustrating, as if the agent didn\u2019t understand my question. I asked for another agent but they tried again to answer. After my second request to transfer, I was told to hold.\n\nUnfortunately, no one else was available, so I tried simplifying my question. That worked, and I got the answer I expected \u2014 Avast One protects my browser from malware and also scans my computer. I also asked some VPN questions and received prompt and accurate replies.\n\nAfter 15 minutes, suddenly the answers came quickly and with higher quality. I suspect the misunderstanding was a side effect of trying to help too many customers at once. That\u2019s the nature of live support, and it will always vary.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied with Avast\u2019s support via live chat.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nAccording to Avast\u2019s privacy policy, Avast One\u2019s free app might show targeted ads. In my brief test, I didn\u2019t see any, but I quickly switched to a paid plan to complete the review.\n\nThe end-user license agreement allows Avast to send you promotional offers to upgrade to a higher-priced subscription. After three months on Avast\u2019s mailing list, I haven\u2019t noticed many emails, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to be concerned about.\n\nHowever, Avast has had some privacy issues in the past. Google removed the Avast browser extension in 2019 for spying on Chrome users.\n\nAfter five years of behaving kindly, Avast has well-rated security extensions in the Chrome Web Store. I think it\u2019s safe to let those worries fade away.\n\nAvast One protects your Mac and MacBook\n\nIf you like the sound of Avast One\u2019s subscription plans but want to save money, check our guide to the best antivirus deals. Sometimes Avast has sales that cut first-year costs even lower. Still, the costs will skyrocket to more than double the first year when it\u2019s time to renew.\n\nAvast\u2019s parent company, Gen Digital, also owns Norton Security. Norton 360 for Mac has a better subscription package at lower prices, so that\u2019s a better choice if you\u2019re paying for protection.\n\nAvast One Basic (Essential) is a nice, free antivirus that could provide everything you need. It includes prevention and protection just as powerful as what\u2019s in the paid version. If you want more, our guide to the best antivirus software breaks down features and costs to help you make an informed purchase."
