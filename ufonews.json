            "article_content": "He has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansjurgen Kohler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (Cenap), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says Kohler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office Cenap.\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" Kohler says.\n\nAccording to its director, Cenap has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, Kohler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, Kohler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nHe founded Cenap as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand\".\n\nThe organisation, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to Cenap has changed dramatically over the decades, Kohler says.\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nThanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to Cenap, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" Kohler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organisation recorded over 850 cases by Oct 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global Internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups \u2013 rocket ignitions \u2013 in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun\", Kohler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nFirst of all, Cenap records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" Kohler says.\n\nThe organisation also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the Cenap director.\n\nSatellites and other objects can be seen as trails of light between the stars in the night sky above the eastern German state of Brandenburg (taken with 20 seconds of exposure time, therefore the moving objects can be seen as lines). Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpa\n\nConspiracy theorists\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, Kohler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nKohler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organisation is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nKohler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life \u2013 or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth\".\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\" \u2013 dpa"

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is Part 2 of a two-part series about UFOs/UAPs and the connection between past sightings in the Minot area and the recent sightings of mysterious drones across the country.\n\nDrones have been swarming military facilities and around U.S. ships for a year or two and in all cases they were never shot down, Steve Bassett, a UFO lobbyist and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, told The Minot Daily News in a Dec. 26, 2024, interview.\n\nBecause of all the recent sightings of mysterious drones in the U.S. and also in the United Kingdom, Bassett said, \u201cPeople are filming them with their cameras and these films are turning up online. The government is getting hard questions and the best that the U.S. government has been able to do in several interviews with the press is that it\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s not a foreign adversary or another nation and we don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\u201cNow this is ridiculous,\u201d Bassett said. He said any swarms of objects like that around U.S. warships would be shot down and every effort would be made to bring them down if any of these objects were over military bases.\n\n\u201cBut it would be a huge, huge national security matter. We know that they\u2019re not shooting them down; they\u2019re not capturing them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said people are seeing what obviously are drones.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of other stuff up there which are not drones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only conclusion that makes sense is that this is a UFO (unidentified flying object) flap. There have been a number of these (flaps) over the last 70 years. There\u2019s a lot of sightings, a lot of stuff in the area even nationally and then it goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest one ever. It\u2019s been going on for at least two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI believe what is going on is that the nonhumans \u2013 or whatever you want to call them. I call them extraterrestrials \u2013 are putting on a helluva display. They are swarming around sensitive facilities and the reason they are doing that is not to attack those facilities but to get the maximum attention. They are doing this for a reason and the government is helpless. There\u2019s nothing it can do about it.\u201d\n\nBassett maintains the government knows that they\u2019re nonhuman.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely know that these are not human craft, human-made craft, whatever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what do you do? They can\u2019t ignore it. They have to answer the questions and the best they\u2019ve been able to do is they\u2019re not ours, they\u2019re not another counties, they\u2019re not a threat and they\u2019re not shooting them down,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he believes the military is launching its own drones up into these events so people do see drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re masking the nonhuman part of this by at least adding the human part so people will see that and then they can just call it a drone swarm and not have to face the ultimate question is what are those things up there that aren\u2019t drones?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing that explains what is happening within the standard logic that one can imply and the government is in an impossible position and if the nonhuman craft up there continue and continue to do this activity, the government is going to have to finally acknowledge that we are not alone. That\u2019s what I think is going on,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nNuclear weapons shutdown witnesses\n\nHe went on, \u201cNow the reason I think this is interesting for Minot is that, of course, this has made it much easier to get the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses and other related witnesses to the attention of Congress.\u201d\n\nBassett said it\u2019s very likely the next hearing will include the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses. He said the witnesses to nuclear ICBM shutdown events have been trying to get in front of a hearing in Congress for many years but have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to bring those cases really back into the world and people will learn about what happened 60 years ago,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nHe said some of the witnesses have been reluctant to speak about the incidents because it wasn\u2019t a good situation.\n\n\u201cBut the situation is obviously changing so I think that we may see several more be willing to come forward once we have the formal hearing process,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he has said in hundreds of interviews that the shutdown of ICBMs by these entities is the single most important thing known about them.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that mock hearing in 2013 would help lead to real hearings\u201d He said it provided some help but it took several more years before a hearing finally took place.\n\nWhen another congressional hearing is held, David Schindele, a former Minot Air Force Base missile officer who was involved in a UFO incident that occurred in the Minot missile field in 1966, said he would \u201cdefinitely testify before Congress when I\u2019m called to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Trump, there\u2019s a very good possibility that he\u2019s going to seize this, based upon what I\u2019ve been reading in the news and other statements. He may jump on this early. We could see this break in the first 30 to 60 days of the Trump administration. We could have hearings that may come forward or he may just come forward on his own because he\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Bassett said.\n\n\u201cSo this embargo on the truth of this matter may be about to end in the next couple months and it can\u2019t happen too soon,\u201d Bassett said."

In his article \u201cThings we learned about LLMs in 2024,\u201d he simultaneously susses out how much happened in 2024 and why it\u2019s confusing. For example, we\u2019re all told to aggressively use genAI or risk falling behind, but we\u2019re awash in AI-generated \u201cslop\u201d that no one really wants to read. He also points out that LLMs, although marketed as the easy path to AI riches for all who master them, are actually \u201cchainsaws disguised as kitchen knives.\u201d He explains that \u201cthey look deceptively simple to use \u2026 but in reality you need a huge depth of both understanding and experience to make the most of them and avoid their many pitfalls.\u201d\n\nIf anything, this quagmire got worse in 2024. Incredibly smart people are building incredibly sophisticated systems that leave most developers incredibly frustrated by how to use them effectively. \u201cThe default LLM chat UI is like taking brand-new computer users,\u201d Willison argues, \u201cdropping them into a Linux terminal and expecting them to figure it all out.\u201d It\u2019s not pretty and it\u2019s getting worse, not better.\n\nSmall wonder that the biggest AI flops of 2024, as captured by MIT Technology Review, largely relate to our collective inability to turn AI into applications that normal people want to use. Even basic things, like Apple\u2019s attempt to summarize my incoming text messages, are more confusing than useful. Some of this stems from the inability to trust AI to deliver consistent results, but much of it derives from the fact that we keep loading developers up with AI primitives (similar to cloud primitives like storage, networking, and compute) that force them to do the heavy lifting of turning those foundational building blocks into applications."

            "article_content": "You\u2019ve no doubt noticed artificial intelligence finding its way into every app, service, and hardware device. It\u2019s now unusual to see a tech product launch where AI isn\u2019t the main talking point. Meta is one of the companies pushing AI the hardest, with its own set of AI models, and a selection of AI bots and tools inside its own apps. (Experts and critics also say Meta may be taking their AI too far, which Meta responded to by removing multiple AI profile accounts.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve used Facebook, WhatsApp, or Instagram recently, then you may have spotted a new Meta AI bot, ready and waiting to be of assistance. Here\u2019s how you can make use of it\u2014and what your options are in terms of security and privacy.\n\nHow to find Meta AI\n\nYou\u2019ll find Meta AI front and center in Meta\u2019s apps: In the Facebook Messenger app, for example, tap Chats and you\u2019ll see a Meta AI input box right at the top, above your real life friends and family members. Tap inside that box, and you can start chatting about whatever topic you like. You can also tap Meta AI on the tab bar at the bottom.\n\nIt\u2019s the same in the WhatsApp app (you\u2019ll see the Meta AI logo on the Chats tab), and in the Instagram app (tap the message button, in the top right corner of the home tab, and Meta AI is at the top). The Meta AI logo is a glowing blue and purple circle, and it\u2019s hard to miss as you use the apps.\n\nMeta AI is prominently displayed in your chats. Screenshot: Meta\n\nThere\u2019s another way to get Meta AI up, inside one-to-one or group chats with real people: Tag @MetaAI in your conversation, type out a prompt, and you\u2019ll get the same response as you would if you were chatting to the AI bot directly\u2014except, of course, the other chat participants will be able to see the message and response.\n\nThe AI bot chats all use the same underlying model (called Llama), but your chats aren\u2019t synced between the three apps. Unfortunately for AI skeptics, there\u2019s no way to hide or turn off Meta AI: You just have to ignore it if you don\u2019t want to use it. However, you can delete, mute, and archive Meta AI chats just like any other conversation\u2014just long press on the AI chat in the main conversation list.\n\nHow to use Meta AI\n\nIf you\u2019ve used an AI chatbot like Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT, then you\u2019ll be familiar with the way these tools work: You can ask Meta AI to look up facts from the web, write poetry, or suggest ideas for something. You can get recommendations for podcasts, inspiration for a birthday party, or suggestions about how to fix a faucet leak.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI for advice and instruction on just about any topic\u2014though as usual with generative AI, be careful of putting too much trust in the answers. These AI bots are built to imagine new text, and that can lead to hallucinations. Sometimes Meta AI will reference the web (when looking up facts, for example)\u2014and when this happens you\u2019ll see web links within the response. Tap on these links to check the facts.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI questions about just about anything. Screenshot: Meta\n\nImage generation is included here: Just ask Meta AI to create or draw an image of whatever you like. It could be a cat sat on a wall, a cabin in the woods, or a person exploring the surface of Mars. The more detail you can add, the more closely the result is going to match your original vision\u2014and you can specify the style of the image too, whether it\u2019s a photo, a painting, or something else.\n\nThere are some interesting image-related tricks you can try: For example, you can use it to create a new profile picture for yourself. Two suggestions from Meta are \u201cimagine me as royalty\u201d or \u201cimagine me in a surrealist painting\u201d, so you can see what\u2019s possible. You\u2019re also able to edit an AI-generated image by tapping and holding on it, then typing in your additional prompt.\n\nMeta AI can generate images for you as well. Screenshot: Meta\n\nMeta itself splits what you can do into three main sections: learn (\u201csummarize the history of the Universe\u201d), create (\u201cimagine dogs playing chess\u201d), and connect (\u201cplan a game night with friends\u201d). That gives you some idea of what\u2019s possible, and you can now interact with Meta AI with your voice if you want\u2014just tap the sound button to the right of the input box.\n\nOne of the features recently added to Meta AI is the ability to use photos in your chats\u2014either picked from your phone\u2019s gallery or taken through the camera. You can identify objects and landmarks, create AI images based on existing photos, and more: Try snapping a picture of a cake and asking how to make it, for example."

It sounds promising, I can't deny.\n\nYou may be skeptical about it, but smartphones can be used for more than just chatting, checking the weather, and taking pictures of your cat. In Kenya, some use their smartphones to grow more food.In Western Kenya, Roseline Akochi, a smallholder farmer, uses artificial intelligence (AI) to improve her crops . She is growing cassava \u2013 a starchy and carbohydrates-rich root vegetable grown in Africa, Asia, and South America.Roseline uses her phone to scan her plants. That's how she can instantly diagnose diseases and pests: she's using an app developed by the non-profit organization Plant Village. This technology provides immediate solutions to crop health issues, addressing challenges that farmers like Akochi have faced for years.The app offers more than just disease diagnosis. It also includes resources on obtaining quality seeds, preparing land, and connecting with agricultural specialists. Since adopting the app in 2018, Akochi has seen a dramatic increase in her harvest. Her cassava yield has grown from five bags to 200, enabling her to pay for her children\u2019s education and build a home. That's great, isn't it?Personally, I don't use much AI on my phone, but that will probably change in the near future, as everything has to do with AI more and more and eventually, it will become inevitable. However, many people use AI already\u2026 in all sorts of ways. The aforementioned Kenyan story reminds me of a story from across the globe that also has to do with AI.In Japan, there's the CatsMe! app that uses AI to help pet owners detect if their cats are in pain, reducing the need for stressful vet visits. The app was trained on 6,000 cat images and claims over 95% accuracy, which is expected to improve with more data.The app addresses a common issue, as studies show over 70% of elderly cats experience pain, but only 2% receive veterinary care."

            "article_content": "It has come to my attention that world leaders like JD Vance and Steve Bannon are avid and enthusiastic readers of a computer engineer named Curtis Yarvin. He has written mostly about politics but also about technology and current affairs.\n\nWhat might be most alarming to some that our future vice president is taking Yarvin\u2019s work as an influence, is that his writings are largely composed of anti-democratic and pro-authoritarian themes, along with some inclusion of racism (he claimed that some races are more suited for slavery; I invite you to guess what race he thinks that is).\n\nYou see, Yarvin is one of the founders of something called the \u201cDark Enlightenment\u201d movement, which \u201cargues\u201d against democracy and against egalitarianism \u2013 a school of thought that people have equal intrinsic value and are deserving of equal rights.\n\nThe reason I placed \u201cargues\u201d in quotes is because Yarvin\u2019s writings do not fall under the category of rigorous political philosophy. They are often written in a style that is purposefully and pretentiously difficult to understand that makes it nearly impossible to extract comprehensible arguments.\n\nInstead of concrete arguments, Yarvin\u2019s writings are mostly composed of unsubstantiated claims and obscure references that he doesn\u2019t explain to make it perfectly clear to his audience how well-read he is.\n\nDespite fashioning himself as a political theorist, he is far from a competent one. Here\u2019s a small sample where he is explaining that his \u201cdeep-right\u201d movement must involve authoritarianism:\n\n\u201cThe deep right knows that all government is absolute. Because of this, the deep right is only interested in paths to absolute power.\u201d\n\nWhy would all governments be absolute? If his primary reason for thinking that his deep-right movement should seek to bring about an authoritarian regime rests on this dubious assumption, then it\u2019s already completely undermotivated. He doesn\u2019t explain why a government like ours isn\u2019t a straightforward counterexample.\n\n\u201cIt treats all other paths as traps, since they are by definition dead ends.\u201d\n\nWhat definition? Why must they be dead ends? He doesn\u2019t explain or argue for any of this.\n\n\u201cThe more attractive the first steps into a trap, the deadlier the trap in the end\u2014and political traps can last decades.\u201d\n\nWhy would we believe that the attractiveness of the steps into a trap correlates with the deadliness of the trap? Again, there are no arguments to be found. This small passage is highly representative of Yarvin\u2019s writings in general: a lot of bold, eye-catching claims, and very few reasons provided to actually believe them. In most cases, philosophy of this kind is better categorized as bad poetry, not as a means to systematically examine theories and concepts or a means to form rational beliefs about them.\n\nThis is precisely where people like JD Vance and Steve Bannon have gone wrong. They have confused bad poetry that mentions the Dark Enlightenment, for reasons to believe in the goals of the Dark Enlightenment.\n\nIn a blog titled \u201cIdealism is not Great\u201d, he attempts to \u201cargue\u201d that Idealism, and not religion, is to blame for the violence and destruction that has gone along with religious systems. The entire thing relies on him merely presupposing that this is the case, and a fundamental misunderstanding and misapplication of the concept of platonic universals (Idealism): a philosophical theory that identifies properties like \u201credness\u201d as abstract entities whose nature can be instantiated by concrete objects like apples.\n\n\u201cAn Idealist is a person who believes that universals exist independently. Specifically, in the modern sense, your Idealist believes in concepts such as Democracy, the Environment, Peace, Freedom, Human Rights, Equality, Justice, etc., etc. What do these concepts have in common?[\u2026]they are impossible to define precisely. It\u2019s fairly clear that they have no meaning at all. For example, John Rawls wrote a whole book called A Theory Of Justice which purports to be a rigorous rational derivation of the New Deal regime.\u201d\n\nThis is a perfect demonstration of his being well read enough to mention the concepts of academic disciplines but not educated enough to use them correctly. Subscribing to the theory of platonic realism has no bearing at all on political leanings or really, anything of practical concern at all.\n\nThis also has nothing to do with Rawls. Rawls\u2019 work does not deal at all with the general nature of properties. Instead, he attempts to explore the nature of Justice. Contrary to what Yarvin claims, he does indeed define it and it does not depend at all on Rawls being a Platonic Realist.\n\n\u201cA little while ago I explained that religion, if we define it as a system of belief involving anthropomorphic paranormal entities, cannot directly affect reality.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles Opinion Columnists | Gavin Newsom is gaslighting Californians about homelessness and gas prices\n\nGavin Newsom is gaslighting Californians about homelessness and gas prices Opinion Columnists | Gavin Newsom is Democrats\u2019 potential 2028 frontrunner, but can he win?\n\nGavin Newsom is Democrats\u2019 potential 2028 frontrunner, but can he win?

Let\u2019s be as charitable as possible and say that he thinks that by defining religion as such, it becomes a platonic form, which itself could not have causal efficacy in the world. Why does this need to be expressed? A system of belief can certainly affect reality. My parent\u2019s adherence to the system of belief that tells them that God wants them to attend mass, directly causes them to attend mass.\n\nThis is nonsensical junk food for pseudointellectuals.

There are plenty of academics who have published legitimate attacks on the merits of democracy and egalitarianism. It\u2019s a good thing that JD Vance and Steve Bannon want to read about political philosophy, but why look to a computer scientist for answers?\n\nRafael Perez is a columnist for the Southern California News Group.

            "article_content": "Stephen King\u2019s favourite horror character from his books\n\nTo hit a debut novel out of the park like Stephen King did with Carrie in 1974 is to instantly establish yourself as one of the premier writers of the day. However, perhaps more impressive than simply getting a good book out to the public is that it was a uniquely poised piece of horror fiction.\n\nThe celebrated genre may be one of the most ardently mythologised, with fandoms strong enough to make Taylor Swift blush, but it isn\u2019t always the most marketable to a widespread audience. Stephen King changed all that, and his books became some of the most successful novels ever written. And, as cinema exploded into a new phase in the latter parts of the 20th century, King\u2019s books would be routinely leant on for inspiration.\n\nFew authors can boast as many movie adaptations as King\u2019s 65. The writer has given the cinematic world classics like The Shining and The Shawshank Redemption as well as It and Stand By Me, a range of stories that not only celebrate the unique talent of King but the widespread range of characters within them. The narrative may be what attract most filmmakers to his work, but it is the characters within them that make those movies unforgettable.\n\nWhen asked to pick out his favourite character from his oeuvre, King was quick to land on his favourite. Naturally, it came from one of his scarier books, but still, that\u2019s about the only thing one might have predicted. Many would have thought The Shining protagonist Jack Torrance would be number one, especially considering his issues with Stanley Kubrick over his portrayal. You might also be persuaded into thinking that Pennywise, the demon clown from It might be the writer\u2019s favourite.\n\nHowever, the character King called his favourite to write during a keynote speech at George Washington University was Annie Wilkes from Misery. The picture was directed by Rob Reiner, who had previously directed King\u2019s novella The Body into the definitive coming-of-age classic Stand By Me four years earlier, with stars James Caan and Kathy Bates playing a writer and one of his obsessed fans, respectively.\n\nBates steals the show as Annie Wilkes, the maniacal fan in question who not only engineers the near-fatal crash that leaves Caan in her carer but then proceeds to begin the battle of wits to try and keep him in her home. The movie and the book operate as a brutal reflection on fan culture, which may well have been drawn from King\u2019s heightened experiences of a new life under the spotlight as more and more of his books became global hits and cinematic spectacles.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how Wilkes would become his favourite character. Not only is King\u2019s character an irredeemable villain, but she is able to deliver this terror through a less than usual presence. Previously, King\u2019s monsters would be either animalistic, paranormal or twisted men. Here, with a woman as the lead character, he was able to change the narrative entirely.\n\nThe movie would not only become a commercial success but also achieve the only Oscar that has been given for a Stephen King adaptation as Bates picked up \u2018Best Actress\u2019 in 1991, giving Wilkes a slightly more questionably vulnerable spin. While King would likely resist picking favourites too often, for the most part, it is easy to see how Wilkes may win out every time he is asked."

            "article_content": "Since its discovery in the 1990s, \u201cprogrammed cell death protein 1,\u201d or PD-1, has been regarded as a leading target in cancer treatments. A \u201ccheckpoint\u201d receptor that often resides on the surface of immune system cells, the PD-1 molecule works as a type of off switch that keeps immune cells from attacking other cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter its discovery, which revolutionized oncology and earned a 2018 Nobel Prize, researchers developed new drugs to block PD-1 and unleash the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer. Yet treatments leveraging PD-1 are only effective in a small fraction of cancer patients, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of how PD-1 works. Much of our current knowledge of PD-1\u2019s functions comes from studies in mice, grounded on the assumption that rodent and human biology operate similarly.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers in UC San Diego\u2019s School of Biological Sciences and School of Medicine have now discovered that this assumption may be flawed. In a comprehensive assessment of PD-1 that featured novel biochemical analyses, animal modeling and a new evolutionary roadmap tracing PD-1 back millions of years, the UC San Diego scientists and their colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that PD-1 in mice is significantly weaker than the human version.\n\nWant more breaking news?

Subscribe for FREE\n\nThe study, led by assistant project scientist Takeya Masubuchi, revealed several previously unknown PD-1 characteristics, including a \u201cmotif\u201d \u2014 a specific sequence of amino acids \u2014 that is vastly different in rodents and humans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur work uncovers unexpected species-specific features of PD-1 with implications for developing better pre-clinical models for PD-1,\u201d said Associate Professor Enfu Hui of the School of Biological Sciences, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, and a senior author of the paper. \u201cWe found a motif in PD-1 that\u2019s present in most mammals, including humans, but is surprisingly missing in rodents, making rodent PD-1 uniquely weaker.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the study are published January 3, 2025, in the journal Science Immunology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough many proteins in mice and humans have similar sequences, receptors in the immune system often show greater differences,\u201d said Masubuchi. \u201cOur study shows that these sequence differences can lead to functional variations of immune checkpoint receptors across species.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthering their analysis, the researchers tested the impact of PD-1 humanization in mice \u2014 replacing mouse PD-1 with the human version \u2014 through co-senior author Professor Jack Bui\u2019s laboratory in the Department of Pathology. They found that PD-1 humanization disrupted the ability of immune cells (T cells) to combat tumors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis study shows that as science progresses we need to have a rigorous understanding of the model systems that we use to develop medicines and drugs,\u201d said Bui. \u201cFinding that rodents might be outliers in terms of PD-1 activity forces us to rethink how to deploy medicines to people. If we\u2019ve been testing medicines in rodents and they\u2019re really outliers, we might need better model systems.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTo trace the PD-1 human-rodent differences over time, the researchers collaborated with co-senior author Professor Zhengting Zou and his Chinese Academy of Sciences colleagues. They discovered evidence of a major dip in ancestral rodent PD-1 activity around 66 million years ago after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene (K\u2013Pg) mass extinction event, which wiped out the (non-avian) dinosaurs. The analysis showed that the rodent PD-1 is uniquely weak among all vertebrates. The weakening may be attributed to special ecological adaptations to escape the effects of rodent-specific pathogens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe rodent ancestors survived the extinction event but their immune receptor activities or landscape might have been altered as a consequence of adaptation to new environmental challenges,\u201d said Hui.\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture studies will assess the impact of PD-1 on the anti-tumor activity of T cells in a humanized context across various tumor types.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Masubuchi T, Chen L, Marcel N, et al.

            "article_content": "A groundbreaking discovery by scientists at Japan\u2019s RIKEN Center for Brain Science has revealed an unexpected link between dopamine and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This revelation could mark a major breakthrough in combating one of the most devastating neurological conditions. Dopamine, commonly known as the \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormone, may hold the key to breaking down beta-amyloid plaques\u2014abnormal protein clusters that interfere with brain function and are hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe science behind brain plaques\n\nBeta-amyloid plaques have long been at the center of Alzheimer\u2019s research. These sticky deposits disrupt neural communication, sparking inflammation and progressively damaging brain cells. Over time, this process leads to memory loss, impaired cognitive function, and, ultimately, the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn recent years, the FDA approved two drugs\u2014lecanemab and donanemab\u2014that specifically target beta-amyloid buildup in early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s patients. These treatments have offered some hope, but their effectiveness varies, leaving scientists searching for more reliable solutions. The discovery of dopamine\u2019s potential role in reducing plaques adds a fresh perspective to this ongoing battle.\n\nUnderstanding the dopamine connection\n\nDopamine\u2019s involvement in Alzheimer\u2019s treatment stems from its ability to stimulate the production of neprilysin, an enzyme crucial for breaking down beta-amyloid. Neprilysin acts as a natural cleaner, preventing harmful plaques from accumulating in the brain.\n\nThis connection builds on years of research into neurotransmitters and their role in brain health. While dopamine is traditionally associated with mood regulation and reward pathways, its ability to enhance neprilysin activity adds a new dimension to its significance.\n\nLaboratory evidence supporting dopamine\u2019s role\n\nIn a series of laboratory experiments, researchers tested dopamine\u2019s impact on beta-amyloid plaques over an eight-week period. These studies revealed significant reductions in plaque formation when dopamine levels were increased. To achieve this, scientists administered L-DOPA, a medication already widely used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, which helped elevate dopamine concentrations in the brain.\n\nTest subjects showed not only a reduction in plaques but also improvements in memory and cognitive function. This dual effect underscores the potential of dopamine-based interventions as a comprehensive approach to managing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nClinical implications for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\n\nThe findings open up exciting possibilities for clinical applications. If further research confirms the effectiveness of dopamine in humans, it could pave the way for repurposing existing medications like L-DOPA to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. This approach offers several advantages:\n\nDopamine regulation could provide a safer alternative\n\nBy targeting plaque formation without the need for entirely new drugs, dopamine-based treatments could reduce the time and cost associated with bringing a new therapy to market.\n\nThis research may enhance current treatments\n\nCombining dopamine-regulating therapies with existing anti-amyloid drugs could improve overall outcomes for patients. Such a strategy might delay the onset of severe symptoms or slow disease progression, offering hope to millions of individuals and their families.\n\nFuture directions for dopamine research\n\nDespite these promising findings, much work remains before dopamine-based therapies can be widely implemented. Extensive clinical trials are needed to assess their safety, efficacy, and potential side effects in diverse patient populations.\n\nScientists are also exploring ways to refine treatment protocols. This includes determining optimal dosages, timing, and delivery methods for dopamine-enhancing medications. Advances in technology, such as imaging tools to monitor plaque reduction in real-time, could further aid in tailoring treatments to individual patients.\n\nAnother avenue of research involves investigating how dopamine interacts with other biological processes in the brain. Understanding these relationships could unlock even more effective strategies for preventing or reversing Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.\n\nRethinking Alzheimer\u2019s care with new possibilities\n\nThe discovery of dopamine\u2019s role in breaking down beta-amyloid plaques represents a turning point in Alzheimer\u2019s research. By offering a fresh perspective on a complex and poorly understood disease, it has the potential to reshape treatment approaches and improve the lives of countless individuals.\n\nAs science continues to uncover the intricacies of brain function, this breakthrough reminds us that even well-known molecules like dopamine can hold untapped potential. For those affected by Alzheimer\u2019s, this research brings renewed hope for a future where effective treatments are within reach. The journey ahead is long, but the possibilities it offers make every step worthwhile."

Altman said the post was inspired by a recent interview he gave to Bloomberg, which was published on Sunday as well.\n\n\"Ron Conway and Brian Chesky went so far above and beyond the call of duty that I'm not even sure how to describe it,\" Altman wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAltman was fired as OpenAI's CEO on November 17, 2023. The company's board said in a statement that it was removing Altman because he \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board\" but did not elaborate further.\n\nAltman returned as CEO on November 22, 2023, after nearly all of OpenAI's staff threatened to quit if he wasn't reinstated.\n\nIn his blog post, Altman said \"there were a lot of people who did incredible and gigantic amounts of work\" to help him and OpenAI when he was ousted, but Conway and Chesky \"stood out from all others.\"\n\nAD\n\n\"I've of course heard stories about Ron's ability and tenaciousness for years and I've spent a lot of time with Brian over the past couple of years getting a huge amount of help and advice,\" Altman wrote.\n\n\"But there's nothing quite like being in the foxhole with people to see what they can really do,\" he continued. \"I am reasonably confident OpenAI would have fallen apart without their help; they worked around the clock for days until things were done.\"\n\nConway and Chesky, Altman wrote, gave him \"great advice\" and \"stopped me from making several mistakes.\" The pair also tapped on their vast networks to assist him, Altman added.\n\nAD\n\n\"I thought I knew what it looked like to support a founder and a company, and in some small sense I did,\" Altman wrote. \"But I have never before seen, or even heard of, anything like what these guys did, and now I get more fully why they have the legendary status they do.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Conway and Chesky did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nConway and Chesky are longtime friends of Altman and were one of the first people he called after OpenAI fired him.\n\nAD\n\nWhat happened at OpenAI today is a Board coup that we have not seen the likes of since 1985 when the then-Apple board pushed out Steve Jobs. It is shocking; it is irresponsible; and it does not do right by Sam & Greg or all the builders in OpenAI. \u2014 Ron Conway (@RonConway) November 18, 2023\n\nConway was also one of Altman's guest speakers when the latter taught a class on startups at Stanford University in 2014.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAltman and Chesky's friendship, meanwhile, goes back more than a decade. Altman mentored Chesky when Airbnb was a part of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator.\n\nWhen Altman was fired from OpenAI, he briefly considered launching another AI startup but was discouraged by Conway and Chesky, The New York Times reported in December 2023.\n\nAD\n\n\"You should be willing to fight back at least a little more,\" Chesky told Altman, per The Times.\n\nOpenAI's board, Conway later told Time magazine, had fired Altman for \"nitpicky, unfireable, not even close to fireable offenses.\"\n\nThe billionaire venture capitalist had spoken to the magazine as part of a profile on Altman that was published in December 2023.\n\nAD\n\n\"It is reckless and irresponsible for a board to fire a founder over emotional reasons,\" Conway told the outlet."

            "article_content": "OpenAI celebrated ChatGPT\u2019s second anniversary in a big way a few weeks ago. The company held a massive \u201c12 Days\u201d press event, with each day bringing a new AI feature to various products. ChatGPT was a big focus and received various interesting upgrades in December, including a next-gen reasoning model (o3) that should see a wider release in the near future.\n\nHowever, OpenAI did not announce an upgrade for the main model most people use. That\u2019s GPT-4o, which supports Advanced Voice Mode and multimodality. The model was launched in May, so it shouldn\u2019t feel like we need something newer and more powerful.\n\nHowever, the AI industry is moving at break-neck speeds compared to the rest of the tech landscape, and we\u2019ve come to expect innovations to drop at a faster rate. Google is doing the same thing; everyone is.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that OpenAI doesn\u2019t have GPT-5 ready for a teaser announcement. Reports say the firm is struggling with training the AI and is running behind a self-imposed schedule.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nRather than detailing any of that, Sam Altman is doing what you\u2019d probably expect from the CEO of a for-profit company. He\u2019s teasing the near (or more distant) future of AI by talking about AGI (artificial general intelligence) and the next step after that, AI superintelligence.\n\nSam Altman penned a blog post on his website titled Relections, where he mused on the brief history of ChatGPT and where OpenAI is heading. AGI came up right away:\n\nAs we get closer to AGI, it feels like an important time to look at the progress of our company. There is still so much to understand, still so much we don\u2019t know, and it\u2019s still so early. But we know a lot more than we did when we started.\n\nTowards the end of the blog, Altman got back to AGI and superintelligence, saying OpenAI is confident about creating AGI. \u201cWe are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it,\u201d the exec said. However, AGI won\u2019t necessarily come this year. Instead, AI agents might be the killer new feature of AI like ChatGPT:\n\nWe believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents \u201cjoin the workforce\u201d and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes.\n\nAccording to reports, AI agents aren\u2019t necessarily tied to the GPT-5 upgrade. These are different development projects at OpenAI.\n\nAs for how OpenAI understands AGI, TechCrunch points out two different explanations.\n\nFirst, we have the company\u2019s own definition for the term: \u201chighly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d Then there\u2019s a joint OpenAI-Microsoft definition of AGI: AI that can generate at least $100 billion in profits. When that happens, Microsoft will no longer have access to OpenAI tech. Microsoft is one of the biggest investors in OpenAI.\n\nBack to Altman\u2019s blog, he touches on the step after AGI, superintelligence. That\u2019s AI so advanced it will exceed what humans are capable of:\n\nWe are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to superintelligence in the true sense of the word. We love our current products, but we are here for the glorious future. With superintelligence, we can do anything else. Superintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity.\n\nThe CEO acknowledged that superintelligence sounds like sci-fi right now, but it could happen in a few years. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and empowerment, is so important.\u201d\n\nAltman also said his blog post was inspired by a recent interview with Bloomberg, where he addressed some of the same topics, including AGI and superintelligence.\n\nAll of that sounds exciting, yes. It\u2019s also sci-fi. And if you\u2019re familiar with OpenAI bleeding AI safety engineers whose jobs were to rein AI in, you\u2019ll also worry a bit about a superintelligence ChatGPT being aligned with humanity\u2019s best interests. After all, many people, including AI experts, worry that AI could destroy humanity.\n\nI\u2019d be more interested in what comes next from ChatGPT than Altman\u2019s musings. That includes upgrades for GPT-5, a release timeline, and safety features OpenAI is developing for the models that will precede AGI and superintelligence."

The company reportedly expected losses of about $5 billion on revenue of $3.7 billion last year.\n\nExpenditures like staffing, office rent, and AI training infrastructure are to blame. ChatGPT was at one point costing OpenAI an estimated $700,000 per day.\n\nRecently, OpenAI admitted it needs \u201cmore capital than it imagined\u201d as it prepares to undergo a corporate restructuring to attract new investments. To reach profitability, OpenAI is said to be considering increasing the price of its various subscription tiers. The company optimistically projects its revenue will reach $100 billion in 2029, matching the current annual sales of Nestl\u00e9."

            "article_content": "AI, short for Artificial Intelligence, has been around since the 1940s when it helped crack the Enigma code during World War II. But it wasn\u2019t until the early 2010s that the insurance industry began using AI to streamline processes, cut costs, and handle massive amounts of data.\n\nToday, AI powers claims processing, customer service, and risk assessments\u2014revolutionizing how insurers operate. What Is Insurance Underwriting? Underwriting is the backbone of insurance. It's how insurers figure out whether to cover you and how much to charge. They assess your risk based on factors like your health (for health insurance), your driving record (for car insurance), or your home\u2019s location and security (for home insurance).\n\nThe goal is to set fair premiums while spreading risk across a wide pool of people. If your risk is too high, coverage might be denied. If approved, underwriters calculate your premiums based on their risk assessment. This process is critical because it influences whether your claims are successful later on. Transparency and accuracy at the start of your application are key.\n\nHow AI Is Changing the Game AI brings speed, precision, and personalization to underwriting. Here\u2019s how: 1. Fraud Detection & Bias Reduction AI spots irregular patterns in applications and claims, reducing human error and cutting out biases. This makes the process fairer for everyone. 2. Personalized Policies By analyzing data from connected devices, telematics, and even social media, AI tailors insurance policies to fit individual needs, moving away from cookie-cutter solutions.\n\n3. Predictive Analytics AI helps insurers predict risks more accurately, improving coverage reliability and enabling smarter decisions based on customer behaviour and market trends. 4. Efficiency Boost Tasks like data crunching and initial risk assessments are handled by AI, freeing up human experts to focus on complex cases that need a personal touch. The Impact on the Insurance Experience AI has transformed how insurers interact with clients and handle policies:\n\nSmart Product Recommendations: Using data from wearables, voice recognition, and social media, insurers can suggest coverage that matches your lifestyle.\n\nFaster Processes: Policy management is quicker and more accurate, improving customer satisfaction.\n\nAutomated Assessments: Advanced image processing allows insurers to assess damages without manual inspections, saving time and reducing costs. Challenges with AI in Insurance Despite its benefits, AI isn\u2019t perfect. It learns from historical data, so if that data is biased\u2014say, against certain demographics\u2014AI can repeat those mistakes, leading to unfair outcomes like higher premiums or denied coverage. Transparency is crucial; insurers need to show how decisions are made to build trust and confidence in their systems. Looking Ahead AI in underwriting offers huge potential: a smoother customer experience, better fraud prevention, and more accurate pricing.\n\nBut with great power comes great responsibility. Insurers must prioritize data privacy, follow regulations, and address bias to ensure fairness and transparency. In the end, the best outcomes will come from blending AI with human expertise. While AI handles repetitive tasks and crunches data, humans provide judgment, empathy, and oversight."

            "article_content": "From dreaming to doing. (Image: Supplied)\n\nFor many people, time off work is a chance to rest and recharge. But for aspiring entrepreneurs, it\u2019s the perfect moment to brainstorm small business ideas that could spark an exciting new venture. If you're looking to channel your passion and creativity into starting a small business, but if you don\u2019t have the perfect idea yet \u2013 this press release is for you.\n\nHere are five ways to generate potential business ideas:\n\n1. Focus on what you love doing and what you\u2019re good at\n\nThe best small business ideas often lie at the intersection of your passions and your skills. Start by asking yourself: What do I genuinely enjoy doing? Maybe you love baking intricate desserts, or perhaps you\u2019re an outdoor enthusiast with a talent for guiding others. Then, reflect on your strengths \u2013 whether it\u2019s teaching, crafting, organising or problem-solving.\n\nThe magic happens when you combine your interests and skills. For instance, if you\u2019re a fitness enthusiast with a knack for teaching, consider starting a virtual fitness coaching service. By aligning your business idea with what you love and excel at, you\u2019ll set yourself up for a venture you\u2019ll feel excited about every day.\n\n2. Solve a problem that keeps popping up\n\nGreat business ideas often emerge from common frustrations. What problems do you, your friends or family face that don\u2019t seem to have good solutions? These gaps in the market can provide a foundation for your business idea.\n\nFor example, if you live in a small town with no reliable dog grooming services, that could be an opportunity to fill a local need. Similarly, if co-workers always complain about the lack of healthy lunch options near your office, a food delivery service offering nutritious meals might hit the mark. Look for those recurring challenges in your community or industry.\n\n3. Think about trends that interest you\n\nKeeping an eye on emerging trends can open the door to innovative ideas. Industries like renewable energy, e-commerce and digital health are booming, offering a wealth of opportunities for creative entrepreneurs.\n\nUse tools like Google Trends to research what people are searching for, explore trending hashtags on social media, or read industry reports to identify movements that excite you. For instance, if you\u2019re passionate about sustainability, you might explore starting a business focused on upcycled products or eco-friendly packaging solutions. Tailoring your idea to fit into a growing trend not only gives you direction but also positions your business for future growth.\n\n4. Let others inspire you\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling stuck, draw inspiration from the success stories of others. Watch documentaries about iconic entrepreneurs, read biographies or binge TED Talks videos about innovation and business. Seeing how others have turned their challenges into thriving businesses can spark your own creativity. Sometimes, all it takes is seeing what is possible to believe in your own potential.\n\n5. Experiment with Domains.co.za's AI Domain Name Generator\n\nHere\u2019s a surprisingly creative way to brainstorm ideas: use our AI Domain Name Generator. While it\u2019s designed to help you find unique available domain names, it can also serve as an unexpected source of inspiration.\n\nInput keywords related to your interests or skills and see what the tool generates. For instance, if you\u2019re interested in wellness, typing in \u201cyoga\u201d or \u201cnutrition\u201d could spark ideas like an online yoga studio or a meal-planning service. It\u2019s a free, fun way to uncover potential business ideas while ensuring the ideal domain name is available when you\u2019re ready to launch.\n\nComing up with the perfect small business idea doesn\u2019t have to be overwhelming \u2013 it just requires some focused thinking, creativity and the right tools."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2014 including the Nobel committees \u2014 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI's potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \"one of the most transformative technologies in human history\". But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2014 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \"illusion of explanatory depth\". Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn't mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \"illusion of exploratory breadth\". Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFinally, the \"illusion of objectivity\". Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nRelated: 'It might pave the way for novel forms of artistic expression': Generative AI isn't a threat to artists \u2014 it's an opportunity to redefine art itself\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI's increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \" AI Scientist \" machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company's vision is to develop a \"fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\", where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2014 though critics said the system produced \" endless scientific slop \".\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \"accelerate\" the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value , further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can't take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \" trust the science \" can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritizes the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2014 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalize the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \"outsourcing\" that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI ? And how can researchers remain aligned with society's expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt's time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2014 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

            "article_content": "Since its discovery in the 1990s, \u201cprogrammed cell death protein 1,\u201d or PD-1, has been regarded as a leading target in cancer treatments. A \u201ccheckpoint\u201d receptor that often resides on the surface of immune system cells, the PD-1 molecule works as a type of off switch that keeps immune cells from attacking other cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter its discovery, which revolutionized oncology and earned a 2018 Nobel Prize, researchers developed new drugs to block PD-1 and unleash the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer. Yet treatments leveraging PD-1 are only effective in a small fraction of cancer patients, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of how PD-1 works. Much of our current knowledge of PD-1\u2019s functions comes from studies in mice, grounded on the assumption that rodent and human biology operate similarly.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers in UC San Diego\u2019s School of Biological Sciences and School of Medicine have now discovered that this assumption may be flawed. In a comprehensive assessment of PD-1 that featured novel biochemical analyses, animal modeling and a new evolutionary roadmap tracing PD-1 back millions of years, the UC San Diego scientists and their colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that PD-1 in mice is significantly weaker than the human version.\n\nWant more breaking news?

Subscribe for FREE\n\nThe study, led by assistant project scientist Takeya Masubuchi, revealed several previously unknown PD-1 characteristics, including a \u201cmotif\u201d \u2014 a specific sequence of amino acids \u2014 that is vastly different in rodents and humans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur work uncovers unexpected species-specific features of PD-1 with implications for developing better pre-clinical models for PD-1,\u201d said Associate Professor Enfu Hui of the School of Biological Sciences, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, and a senior author of the paper. \u201cWe found a motif in PD-1 that\u2019s present in most mammals, including humans, but is surprisingly missing in rodents, making rodent PD-1 uniquely weaker.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the study are published January 3, 2025, in the journal Science Immunology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough many proteins in mice and humans have similar sequences, receptors in the immune system often show greater differences,\u201d said Masubuchi. \u201cOur study shows that these sequence differences can lead to functional variations of immune checkpoint receptors across species.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthering their analysis, the researchers tested the impact of PD-1 humanization in mice \u2014 replacing mouse PD-1 with the human version \u2014 through co-senior author Professor Jack Bui\u2019s laboratory in the Department of Pathology. They found that PD-1 humanization disrupted the ability of immune cells (T cells) to combat tumors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis study shows that as science progresses we need to have a rigorous understanding of the model systems that we use to develop medicines and drugs,\u201d said Bui. \u201cFinding that rodents might be outliers in terms of PD-1 activity forces us to rethink how to deploy medicines to people. If we\u2019ve been testing medicines in rodents and they\u2019re really outliers, we might need better model systems.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTo trace the PD-1 human-rodent differences over time, the researchers collaborated with co-senior author Professor Zhengting Zou and his Chinese Academy of Sciences colleagues. They discovered evidence of a major dip in ancestral rodent PD-1 activity around 66 million years ago after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene (K\u2013Pg) mass extinction event, which wiped out the (non-avian) dinosaurs. The analysis showed that the rodent PD-1 is uniquely weak among all vertebrates. The weakening may be attributed to special ecological adaptations to escape the effects of rodent-specific pathogens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe rodent ancestors survived the extinction event but their immune receptor activities or landscape might have been altered as a consequence of adaptation to new environmental challenges,\u201d said Hui.\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture studies will assess the impact of PD-1 on the anti-tumor activity of T cells in a humanized context across various tumor types.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Masubuchi T, Chen L, Marcel N, et al.

            "article_content": "When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), odds are you think about \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks such as Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla simply by default. But in 2024, one smaller player emerged from the deepest corners of the AI realm and propelled itself into the spotlight. Enterprise software darling Palantir Technologies had a year for the record books in 2024. The shares soared by about 350% last year, making Palantir the No. 1 gainer among stocks in the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).\n\nGiven such an epic run, it's natural for investors to be turning over every stone to try and find the next Palantir. I'll explore one of Palantir's chief competitors, a smaller AI software business known as C3.ai (NYSE: AI). Could C3.ai be the Palantir of 2025?\n\nLooking at C3.ai's business trends\n\nEnterprise software is a highly competitive industry. One way that smaller businesses can make headway in software sales is by partnering with larger industry incumbents. During C3.ai's second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Oct. 31), the company closed more than 60% of its deals through this partner ecosystem.\n\nSome of C3.ai's strategic relationships include cloud hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. Moreover, the company also has alliances with consulting firms Booz Allen Hamilton and Capgemini.\n\nWorking with a broad array of big tech firms and specialized consulting agencies has helped C3.ai broaden its end markets. According to the company's latest financial results, nearly half of new bookings came from aerospace and defense contractors, while almost another 30% of deals focus on areas including manufacturing, energy and utilities, and life sciences.\n\nIn the table below, I've broken down C3.ai's annual revenue growth rate during the past several quarters:\n\nCategory Q1 Fiscal 2024 Q2 Fiscal 2024 Q3 Fiscal 2024 Q4 Fiscal 2024 Q1 Fiscal 2025 Q2 Fiscal 2025 Revenue growth rate % year over year 11% 17% 18% 20% 21% 29%\n\nData source: C3.ai investor relations.\n\nIn slightly more than one year's time, C3.ai has nearly tripled its revenue growth rate. That alone is worth a nod of approval; however, what is even more impressive is C3.ai's top line now is growing at about the same rate as Palantir's.\n\nWith that in mind, I bet you'd think C3.ai stock is skyrocketing. Well, guess again.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nC3.ai's valuation is compelling compared to its peers\n\nThe chart illustrates the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for both Palantir and C3.ai.\n\nIt's pretty easy to spot the outlier above. The ongoing valuation expansion in Palantir stock has caused a nearly sixfold disparity between itself and C3.ai.\n\nStory Continues"

The Nifty Midcap Select fell 2.00 per cent to 12,749.90, while the banking sector indices also faced significant losses with Nifty Bank down 1.61 per cent at 50,167.95 and Nifty Financial Services declining 1.35 per cent to 23,415.20.\n\nMarket breadth remained heavily negative with 3,223 stocks declining against 734 advances on the BSE. The number of stocks hitting lower circuit at 365 significantly outnumbered those touching upper circuit at 228. Despite the broad market weakness, 159 stocks managed to hit their 52-week highs, while 67 touched their 52-week lows.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Apollo Hospitals emerged as the top gainer on the NSE, rising 0.91 per cent, followed by ICICI Bank and Titan with modest gains of 0.15 per cent and 0.05 per cent respectively. The major losers included Tata Steel (-4.18 per cent), BPCL (-3.46 per cent), Adani Enterprises (-3.22 per cent), Kotak Bank (-3.10 per cent), and Trent (-3.05 per cent).\n\nThe market sentiment was affected by news of two HMPV cases detected in Karnataka, both involving infants. The Union Health Ministry confirmed that the cases were identified through routine surveillance, with both patients admitted to Baptist Hospital, Bengaluru, for bronchopneumonia. Neither patient had any international travel history.\n\nWhile the Health Ministry maintained that the HMPV strain is already in global circulation and that there has been no unusual surge in respiratory illnesses, the news appeared to trigger concerns among investors, leading to broad-based selling across sectors.\n\nThe market reaction comes despite the Ministry\u2019s assurance of preparedness and ongoing monitoring through the ICMR and IDSP network, with support from the WHO in tracking the situation in China."

            "article_content": "Only 19 per cent of Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country in Gallup polling in December 2024. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n\u2013 To hear US President-elect Donald Trump tell it, he is about to take over a nation ravaged by crisis, a desolate hellscape of crime, chaos and economic hardship. \u201cOur country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the world!\u201d he declared on social media last week.\n\nBut by many traditional metrics, the America that Trump will inherit from President Joe Biden when he takes the oath for a second time, two weeks from Jan 6, is actually in better shape than that bequeathed to any newly elected president since Mr George W. Bush came into office in 2001.\n\nFor the first time since that transition 24 years ago, there will be no US troops at war overseas on Inauguration Day. New data reported in the past few days indicate that murders are way down, illegal immigration at the southern border has fallen even below where it was when Trump left office and roaring stock markets finished their best two years in a quarter-century.\n\nJobs are up, wages are rising and the economy is growing as fast as it did during Trump\u2019s presidency. Unemployment is as low as it was just before the Covid-19 pandemic and near its historic best. Domestic energy production is higher than it has ever been.\n\nThe manufacturing sector has more jobs than under any president since Mr Bush. Drug overdose deaths have fallen for the first time in years. Even inflation, the scourge of the Biden presidency, has returned closer to normal, although prices remain higher than they were four years ago.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is inheriting an economy that is about as good as it ever gets,\u201d said Mr Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe US economy is the envy of the rest of the world, as it is the only significant economy that is growing more quickly post-pandemic than pre-pandemic.\u201d\n\nThose positive trends were not enough to swing a sour electorate behind US Vice-President Kamala Harris in the November election, reflecting a substantial gap between what statistics say and what ordinary Americans appear to feel about the state of the country. And the United States clearly faces some major challenges that will confront Trump as he retakes power.\n\nThe terrorist attack that killed 15 people in New Orleans early on New Year\u2019s Day, carried out by an American man who said he had joined the ISIS extremist group, served as a reminder that the group \u2013 which Trump likes to boast he defeated during his previous term \u2013 remains a threat and an inspiration to radicalised lone wolves. The wars in Ukraine and in the Gaza Strip are daunting challenges even without US troops engaged in combat there.\n\nThanks in part to Covid-19 relief spending by both Trump and Mr Biden, the national debt has ballooned so much that it now represents a larger share of the economy than it has in generations, other than during the pandemic itself. Families remain pressed by the cost of living, including housing, healthcare and college tuition. The cost of petrol, while down from its peak, is still about 70 US cents per gallon higher than when Mr Biden took office.\n\nMoreover, Americans remain as divided as they have been in many years \u2013 politically, ideologically, economically, racially and culturally. As healthy as the country may be economically and otherwise, a variety of scholars, surveys and other indicators suggest the US is struggling to come together behind a common view of its national identity, either at home or abroad.\n\nIndeed, many Americans do not perceive the country to be doing as well as the data suggests, either because they do not see it in their own lives, they do not trust the statistics or they accept the dystopian view promoted by Trump and amplified by a fragmented, choose-your-own-news media and online ecosphere.\n\nOnly 19 per cent of Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country in Gallup polling in December 2024. In another Gallup survey in September, 52 per cent of Americans said they and their own family were worse off than four years ago, a higher proportion than felt that way in the presidential election years of 1984, 1992, 2004, 2012 or 2020.\n\nIt was in Trump\u2019s political interest, of course, to encourage that sentiment and appeal to it during 2024 \u2019s campaign. He was hardly the first challenger to emphasise the negative to defeat an incumbent president.\n\nMr Dwight Eisenhower disparaged the state of the country when he first ran for president in 1952, much to the irritation of then President Harry S. Truman, only to have Mr John F. Kennedy do the same to him when running in 1960. Mr Kennedy hammered away at a \u201cmissile gap\u201d with the Soviet Union that did not exist, then after winning declared that the US was in \u201cits hour of maximum danger\u201d, in contrast to Mr Eisenhower\u2019s view of his security record.\n\n\u201cThis is a contrast you oftentimes find,\u201d said Mr Michael Beschloss, a historian who has written nine books on the American presidency. \u201cCandidates who are running against incumbent presidents or sitting governments make it sound much worse than it is.\u201d\n\nStill, few have been as extreme in their negative descriptions as Trump, or as resistant to fact-checking. He has suggested falsely that immigration, crime and inflation are out of control, attributed the New Orleans incident to lax border policies even though the attacker was an American born in Texas and as recently as Jan 4 called the country \u201ca total mess!\u201d\n\nYet Trump is moving back into the White House with an enviable hand to play, one that other presidents would have dearly loved on their opening day. President Ronald Reagan inherited double-digit inflation and an unemployment rate twice as high as today. President Barack Obama inherited two foreign wars and an epic financial crisis. Mr Biden inherited a devastating pandemic and the resulting economic turmoil.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s stepping into an improving situation,\u201d Dr William J. Antholis, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Centre of Public Affairs, which has studied presidential transitions, said of Trump.\n\nDr Antholis compared the situation with then President Bill Clinton\u2019s arrival in 1993, when he took over a growing economy and a new post-Cold War order. While the country had already begun recovering from recession during the 1992 election, many voters did not yet feel it and punished President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals of the economy had turned just before the election, and kept moving in the right direction when Clinton took over,\u201d Mr Antholis recalled.\n\nMuch as it did for the first Mr Bush\u2019s team, the disconnect between macro trends and individual perceptions proved enormously frustrating to Mr Biden and Ms Harris, who failed to persuade voters during the 2024 election that the country was doing better than commonly believed. Rattling off statistics and boasting about the success of \u201cBidenomics\u201d did not resonate with voters who did not see it the same way.\n\n\u201cOf course, not everyone is enjoying good economic times, as many low-middle income households are struggling financially, and the nation has mounting fiscal challenges,\u201d Mr Zandi said. \u201cBut taking the economy in its totality, it rarely performs better than it is now as President Trump takes office.\u201d\n\nMr Andrew Bates, a White House spokesperson, said the latest reports demonstrated that Mr Biden\u2019s policies are working and argued that Republicans should not seek to repeal them once they take control of the presidency and both houses of Congress.\n\n\u201cAfter inheriting an economy in free-fall and skyrocketing violent crime, President Biden is proud to hand his successor the best-performing economy on Earth, the lowest violent crime rates in over 50 years, and the lowest border crossings in over four years,\u201d Mr Bates said.\n\nMs Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump, responded by citing the election: \u201cAmericans delivered an overwhelming Election Day rebuke of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s abysmal track record: communities being overrun with millions of unvetted migrants who walked over Biden\u2019s open border, lower real wages, and declining trust in increasingly politicized law enforcement agencies that are unable to even publish accurate crime data.\u201d\n\nTrump does not have to share a positive view of the situation to benefit from it. When he takes office on Jan 20, absent the unexpected, he will not face the sort of major immediate action-forcing crisis that, say, Mr Obama did in needing to rescue the economy from the brink of another Great Depression.\n\nTrump instead will have more latitude to pursue favoured policies such as mass deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally or tariffs on foreign imported goods. And if past is prologue, he may eventually begin extolling the state of the economy to claim successes for his policies.\n\nHe has already taken credit for recent increases in stock prices even before assuming office. He has a demonstrated skill for self-promotion that eluded Mr Biden, enabling him to persuade many Americans that the economy during his first term was even better than it actually was.\n\nAt the same time, with unemployment, crime, border crossings and even inflation already pretty low, it may be difficult for Trump to improve on them significantly. Trump obliquely seemed to acknowledge as much when he noted in a post-election interview with Time magazine that he may not be able to live up to his campaign pledge to lower grocery prices. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bring things down once they\u2019re up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, Trump faces the risk that the economy goes in the other direction. Some specialists have warned that a tariff-driven trade war with major economic partners could, for instance, reignite inflation.\n\nDr N. Gregory Mankiw, an economics professor at Harvard University and chair of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under the second Mr Bush, recalled that even his former boss faced significant challenges when he took office in 2001 as the economy was already heading into a relatively mild recession following the bust of the dot-com boom.\n\n\u201cThere are no similar storm clouds on the horizon right now,\u201d Dr Mankiw said. \u201cThat is certainly lucky for Trump. On the other hand, all presidents must deal with unexpected shocks to the economy. We just don\u2019t know yet what kind of shocks President Trump will have to handle.\u201d NYTIMES\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you."

He\u2019s been working as a doctor since 1987 and he\u2019s worried that giving up medicine will force him to slow down. He\u2019s also concerned the global economy will soon collapse.\n\nHe has a private practice with a revenue of approximately \u00a3180,000 a year, which he is looking to expand, while the company also has cash reserves of \u00a350,000. His accountants say that he could sell his business for around \u00a3110,000.\n\nSix years ago, he bought a house in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, which he estimates is now worth \u00a3650,000.\n\nHe contributes \u00a33,000 a month into a company pension, and also has a personal pension worth \u00a3170,000. A keen flier, he also owns a two-seater plane, which he nicknames the \u201cair conditioning unit\u201d. He bought it for \u00a326,000 but estimates it is now worth \u00a332,000.\n\nDr Hopkins is also worried about the security of his assets: \u201cI\u2019ve probably been watching far too many YouTube videos on economics, but my impression is that we are heading towards a major collapse of the economy.\u201d\n\nGold is his asset of choice, but he has struggled to find financial advisers to meet his needs after a trusted adviser, who worked with his father, retired.\n\nThe doctor has previously been stung by advisers who promised to put his pessimistic prediction into action, only to then say they weren\u2019t prepared to build a gold-only portfolio.\n\nHe said he is prepared to listen to advice about how to secure his assets, but that he wants the assumption of collapse to be at the heart of his investing strategy.\n\nDr Hopkins said: \u201cI am quite prepared to listen to that, I am not being dogmatic. But I want to invest in something that is extremely safe for when the economy collapses, and I just cannot find anyone [to help].\u201d"

            "article_content": "The recently released Thelio Astra from American computer manufacturer System76 is being touted as \"the fastest Arm desktop computer in the world\" \u2013 or at least that's what developer and influencer Jeff Geerling declared after putting the system through its paces.\n\nIn Geerling's testing using the Cinebench 2024 benchmark, the top-tier variant of the Thelio Astra, powered by the 128-core Ampere Altra Max M128-30, achieved an eye-watering 5,003 points in multi-threaded mode. This score edges out the certified world record of 4,723 points set by AMD's EPYC 7713 chip with a similar number of cores.\n\nGiven these figures, it's no surprise that the Astra also excelled in Blender rendering workloads. Geerling specifically highlighted the system's impressive 1.7 TFLOPS of double-precision compute power.\n\nWhen it comes to the overall package, this is far from your average pre-built desktop. The entry-level $3,299 model already packs a serious punch with 64 cores, 64GB of RAM, and an RTX A400 GPU. However, the top configuration Geerling tested \u2013 priced just shy of $7,000 \u2013 pulls out all the stops with 128 cores, 512GB of octa-channel RAM, 40TB of storage capacity, and an RTX 6000 Ada GPU.\n\nAll this hardware is housed in a sleek, quiet tower, which again is a surprise considering the near server-grade specs. Patriots will also be pleased to know that it's an American-made system, coming straight out of System76's Denver facility.\n\nGeerling did highlight some downsides with the system though. Beyond its ultra-premium pricing, single-threaded performance is underwhelming and barely inches past AMD's 2017 Threadripper 1950X in the same Cinebench test. That's sad considering the prodigious multi-core muscle.\n\nThere are also platform limitations to consider. The system is restricted to PCIe 4.0 and DDR4 RAM, which may feel outdated to some. Geerling was also less than thrilled with the lack of front I/O ports and noted some rattling from the PCIe brackets. And if you're thinking about gaming on this machine while running Windows, think again \u2013 Nvidia has yet to release Arm-compatible drivers.\n\nBut then again, the Thelio Astra isn't designed to be a gaming rig or a general-purpose desktop PC replacement. System76 is squarely targeting developers, with a particular emphasis on the automotive software industry, where it shines as a platform for \"rapid dev prototyping.\"\n\n\"System76 and Ampere ride together to make Thelio Astra the driving force behind AV development,\" the company notes on its website. If you're in that niche and have cash to burn, this could be the latest must-have Arm toy for you."

            "article_content": "Seeking to keep sensitive data private and accelerate AI workloads? Look no further than AI PCs powered by Intel Core Ultra processors with a built-in NPU.\n\nRunning AI workloads with sensitive data in the public cloud has its disadvantages, but a new generation of laptops can now perform many of the same tasks locally, in smaller form, and at a much lower cost.\n\nCPUs have had several hardware add-ons to help with the hard work behind various computational workloads since personal computers emerged in the late 1970s. Intel is now advancing this effort with a dedicated AI accelerator called a neural processing unit (NPU), which is ideal for power-efficient, sustained AI workloads.\n\nThe Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 Ultra processors that power Intel\u2019s AI PCs allow AI workloads to be offloaded from the cloud to the PC itself, reducing latency and cost while keeping sensitive data private by ensuring that it never leaves your PC. Also, this doesn\u2019t affect CPU performance or drain battery life as much, or slow down the computer while bits are being crunched.\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing because AI workloads often run very differently than the day-to-day workloads of web browsers, word processors, spreadsheets, and the like. NPUs are optimized to have tons of parallel processing power and can bring that to bear on the large number of mathematical operations needed for the calculations that AI needs. They do not have to be super precise, but they need to be fast, and to run in the background without sucking your battery dry.\n\nTo improve efficiency and extend battery life, Intel already has been offloading processes to separate cores such as P-cores (performance cores) and E-cores (efficiency cores), depending upon processing need. And for some uses, like image processing, integrated graphics processing units (GPUs) handle display activities, since GPUs are highly optimized for those workloads and not for the things a CPU focuses on. It\u2019s far more efficient to have a GPU just crank through images and not disturb the CPU, which can then focus on your other critical tasks.\n\nCheck out this blog to learn more about ESET\u2019s ongoing collaboration with Intel and how leveraging AI PC architecture can help ESET improve cybersecurity and user experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to improve native device security with AI, your life will probably get a lot easier. The ability to offload to the NPU things like looking for phishing email attempts, then report the results back to the system\u2019s security software will speed related detections significantly.\n\nTurning to hardware for improved malware detection is all the rage, as the usefulness of things originally intended for simple system hardware health is extended to perform operations like helping to detect malware at a very low level and handing the results of AI processing to security software to kill malicious code.\n\nYears ago, we watched as hardware solutions for security and privacy got its own dedicated hardware, including secure external drives, expansion cards for offloading web traffic encryption, cryptographic processors like TPM chips for securing our PCs\u2019 secrets, and so on. These days, hardware and software bundles include cutting-edge capabilities developed through Intel\u2019s collaboration with ESET, notably Intel\u00ae Threat Detection Technology and hybrid processor architecture.\n\nExpect that trend to continue. As the integration of dedicated GPUs and NPUs progresses, your laptop\u2019s processor will be able to handle much more sophisticated AI workloads seamlessly in the background, even without internet access, and possibly be able to make your AI-powered laptop seem even more creepy-smart.\n\nWhile the use of dedicated AI hardware in PCs is still in its infancy, the possible uses in cybersecurity are immense. Embedded NPUs are just the beginning, and perhaps we will see other hardware-level improvements in processors that security software can leverage in the future, not just to improve performance, but to also keep computers more secure while doing the heavy lifting of AI workloads."

The user said their father, who had significant military experience, was unable to explain what was behind the light.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cMy dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before\u2026\n\nImage: Reddit) Reddit)\n\n\u201cJust after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,\u201d the user said according to the Mail Online.\n\n\u201cMy friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone\u2026 Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.\"\n\nOnlookers were confused by the orb, which appeared to be similar to other objects spotted in the US recently. Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video on December 27 and said they saw \u201cfour strange orbs in formation in what is supposed to be a no-fly zone\u201d in Brookville Blvd, Queens, New York.\n\nImage: Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701) Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701)\n\nIn December, while media in the US focused on reports of puzzling unidentified aircraft in New Jersey, it appears some believe we may have our own mysterious visitors. There were three official reports of UFO sightings in Northern Ireland in 2024.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence previously recorded UFO sightings, but closed its UFO desk in 2009 after concluding that in more than 50 years, no received report had ever disclosed any evidence of a potential threat.\n\nNick Pope, who previously investigated UFO reports for the MoD, said the figures sound \u201cstaggeringly low\u201d, and said the MoD used to receive \u201cseveral hundred sightings each year\u201d before 2009.\n\nHe said he believes many won\u2019t come forward with sightings because they fear they will not be believed. \u201cNone of the sightings sound particularly spectacular, and the one mentioning red and green flashing lights and a vapour trail is clearly an aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe annotation on the FOI response stating \u2018noted for information by police\u2019 is a polite way of saying the cops didn\u2019t take any further action, and that\u2019s quite understandable, because it really isn\u2019t their job. That doubtless explains the low numbers, because anyone seeing a UFO will realize this isn\u2019t really a matter for the police.\""

The government is getting hard questions and the best that the U.S. government has been able to do in several interviews with the press is that it\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s not a foreign adversary or another nation and we don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\u201cNow this is ridiculous,\u201d Bassett said. He said any swarms of objects like that around U.S. warships would be shot down and every effort would be made to bring them down if any of these objects were over military bases.\n\n\u201cBut it would be a huge, huge national security matter. We know that they\u2019re not shooting them down; they\u2019re not capturing them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said people are seeing what obviously are drones.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of other stuff up there which are not drones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only conclusion that makes sense is that this is a UFO (unidentified flying object) flap. There have been a number of these (flaps) over the last 70 years. There\u2019s a lot of sightings, a lot of stuff in the area even nationally and then it goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest one ever. It\u2019s been going on for at least two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI believe what is going on is that the nonhumans \u2013 or whatever you want to call them. I call them extraterrestrials \u2013 are putting on a helluva display. They are swarming around sensitive facilities and the reason they are doing that is not to attack those facilities but to get the maximum attention. They are doing this for a reason and the government is helpless. There\u2019s nothing it can do about it.\u201d\n\nBassett maintains the government knows that they\u2019re nonhuman.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely know that these are not human craft, human-made craft, whatever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what do you do? They can\u2019t ignore it. They have to answer the questions and the best they\u2019ve been able to do is they\u2019re not ours, they\u2019re not another counties, they\u2019re not a threat and they\u2019re not shooting them down,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he believes the military is launching its own drones up into these events so people do see drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re masking the nonhuman part of this by at least adding the human part so people will see that and then they can just call it a drone swarm and not have to face the ultimate question is what are those things up there that aren\u2019t drones?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing that explains what is happening within the standard logic that one can imply and the government is in an impossible position and if the nonhuman craft up there continue and continue to do this activity, the government is going to have to finally acknowledge that we are not alone. That\u2019s what I think is going on,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nNuclear weapons shutdown witnesses\n\nHe went on, \u201cNow the reason I think this is interesting for Minot is that, of course, this has made it much easier to get the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses and other related witnesses to the attention of Congress.\u201d\n\nBassett said it\u2019s very likely the next hearing will include the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses. He said the witnesses to nuclear ICBM shutdown events have been trying to get in front of a hearing in Congress for many years but have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to bring those cases really back into the world and people will learn about what happened 60 years ago,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nHe said some of the witnesses have been reluctant to speak about the incidents because it wasn\u2019t a good situation.\n\n\u201cBut the situation is obviously changing so I think that we may see several more be willing to come forward once we have the formal hearing process,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he has said in hundreds of interviews that the shutdown of ICBMs by these entities is the single most important thing known about them.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that mock hearing in 2013 would help lead to real hearings\u201d He said it provided some help but it took several more years before a hearing finally took place.\n\nWhen another congressional hearing is held, David Schindele, a former Minot Air Force Base missile officer who was involved in a UFO incident that occurred in the Minot missile field in 1966, said he would \u201cdefinitely testify before Congress when I\u2019m called to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Trump, there\u2019s a very good possibility that he\u2019s going to seize this, based upon what I\u2019ve been reading in the news and other statements. He may jump on this early. We could see this break in the first 30 to 60 days of the Trump administration. We could have hearings that may come forward or he may just come forward on his own because he\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Bassett said.\n\n\u201cSo this embargo on the truth of this matter may be about to end in the next couple months and it can\u2019t happen too soon,\u201d Bassett said."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2014 including the Nobel committees \u2014 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI's potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \"one of the most transformative technologies in human history\". But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2014 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \"illusion of explanatory depth\". Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn't mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \"illusion of exploratory breadth\". Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nRelated: 'It might pave the way for novel forms of artistic expression': Generative AI isn't a threat to artists \u2014 it's an opportunity to redefine art itself\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI's increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \" AI Scientist \" machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company's vision is to develop a \"fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\", where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2014 though critics said the system produced \" endless scientific slop \".\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \"accelerate\" the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value , further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can't take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \" trust the science \" can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritizes the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2014 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalize the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \"outsourcing\" that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI ? And how can researchers remain aligned with society's expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt's time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2014 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

            "article_content": "Swami Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna |\n\nHaridwar, January 5: In the presence of Swami Ramdev Ji Maharaj, the President of Patanjali Yogpeeth, and Acharya Balkrishna, the General Secretary, the 30th foundation day of the Patanjali institution was celebrated at the Yog Bhavan Auditorium, located at Patanjali Wellness, Haridwar. In the program, with the presence of more than 6,000 officials from the Patanjali Yogpeeth organization across the country, Swami Ramdev Ji Maharaj gave an introduction to the 30 years of service, struggle, and dedication and shed light on the future plans of Patanjali Yogpeeth. While announcing the five revolutions after the success of the Yoga Revolution, he said that Patanjali will initiate significant work for freedom in education, healthcare, economy, intellectual-cultural freedom, and liberation from diseases, indulgences, shame, and frustrations.\n\nFirst Revolution: Freedom in Education\n\nHe said that today, 50 to 90, and in some places, 99 percent educated individuals are unemployed, addicted, characterless, and dull children, whose childhood, youth, and our lineage are in danger. We have decided that first in India and then in the entire world, a new education system will be introduced, and its leadership will be done by India. Patanjali Gurukul, Acharyakulam, Patanjali University, and the Indian Education Board will now establish new benchmarks. Our resolution is that in the next five years, we will connect 500,000 schools with the Indian Education Board. This will be an innovative revolution in education.\n\nWe want to give children not only literacy but also subject knowledge, self-awareness, truth-oriented patriotism, and awareness of their pride and glory. We will include knowledge from across the world in Hindi, English, and Sanskrit, keeping up-to-date with the world, but 80% of the content will be from Vedas, philosophy, Upanishads, Puranas, and the pride of India. It will include spiritual sciences, Sanatan awareness, and Indian pride. This will not be Macaulay\u2019s education system. When the Indian Education Board affiliates first 100,000 schools and then 500,000 schools, India's childhood and youth will be secure. This is the resolution for freedom in education. Through the Indian Education Board, we will not teach the false greatness of foreign invaders, Akbar, Aurangzeb, or the British, but rather the true history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Maharana Pratap, and revolutionaries.\n\nSecond Revolution: Freedom in Healthcare\n\n\"Disease is not our nature; Yoga is our nature.\" Today, around the world, due to the consumption of synthetic medicines, steroids, and painkillers, people\u2019s bodies are deteriorating. For healthcare freedom, through Patanjali Wellness, Yoggram, Niramayam, hospitals, and health centers, and modern research, we are advancing the legacy of sages and science. We have published more than 5,000 research protocols and 500 research papers in world-class international journals, presenting solutions to incurable diseases before the world. Our resolution is to prevent people from becoming diseased and to liberate them from diseases through Yoga and Ayurveda.\n\nThird Revolution: Economic Freedom\n\nToday, the entire economy is trapped in the cruel claws of a handful of people. Our goal is prosperity for service and wealth for welfare. So far, Patanjali has done charity worth \u20b91 lakh crore in education, healthcare, research, character-building, and nation-building. With over 10,000 centers, 2.5 million trained Yoga instructors, and 1 crore workers selflessly serving, this is the service work of nation-building and character-building. Our resolution is to make the Swadeshi movement so powerful that India can emerge from economic exploitation, slavery, and poverty, and become supremely prosperous. By eliminating diseases like BP, diabetes, thyroid, asthma, arthritis, stress, and depression and saving on medicines, we save \u20b9700 to \u20b92,000 lakh crore annually for the country.\n\nFourth Revolution: Intellectual and Cultural Freedom\n\nIndia, which first gave the message of spiritual world knowledge to the world, cannot afford to endure intellectual and cultural slavery. Today, India depends on impoverished countries for everything, which have nothing but paper money, dollars, or pounds. True wealth is not just money but also good health, a happy family, character, spiritual wealth, and divine virtues. We must liberate India from intellectual and cultural slavery. Hence, we aim to elevate Sanatan Dharma, Vedic Dharma, Sage Dharma, and Yoga Dharma as the new religion of the era. More than 500 crore people worldwide have faith in Yoga Dharma and Sanatan Dharma. If we walk together, we will end religious terrorism, political terrorism, and the terror being perpetuated in the name of education and healthcare.\n\nFifth Revolution: Freedom from Addictions, Diseases, and Indulgences\n\nA dangerous game of addiction is spreading worldwide. In India, addiction has destroyed lives through diseases, intoxication, and obscenity. Our resolution is freedom from diseases, addictions, and obscenity. On completing 30 years, Patanjali resolves to make the world Yoga-oriented and create ideal global citizens through character-building.\n\nRemarks by Acharya Balkrishna Ji Maharaj\n\nAcharya Balkrishna remarked that with Swami Ji's unrelenting and extraordinary efforts, Patanjali's contribution is inspiring the world. Patanjali runs campaigns for charity using profits from its business. Patanjali is not a market but a family for India. With a team of over 500 world-class scientists, Patanjali is making evidence-based Ayurvedic medicines like juices, herbs, and tablets accessible worldwide. By integrating India\u2019s ancient knowledge with modern science, Patanjali has brought Yoga from caves to the masses, reaching millions in over 200 countries."
