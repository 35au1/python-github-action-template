The sightings are then investigated by multiple agencies.\n\nOnce the Pentagon puts together the report, it\u2019s sent to the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office for review.\n\nThis year, the AARO received 757 new incident reports, 485 from this past year and an additional 272 from 2021-2022 that were not sent. The Pentagon says after being reviewed, the majority of the sightings were found to be ordinary objects.\n\nAs of today, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has received over 1,600 UAP reports, 757 of which came to AARO during the period covered by this report. \u201cAARO has successfully resolved hundreds of cases in its holdings to commonplace objects such as balloons, birds, drones, satellites and aircraft,\u201d said Sabrina Singh, the Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary.\n\nDuring that press briefing, the head of the AARO acknowledged that there were 21 reports over the last year and a half that he can\u2019t explain. The agency added that all 21 happened near national security sites, were recorded on video, and had multiple eyewitnesses.\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Accountability recently held its second hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs, as they call them."

Three key Gemini capabilities are available on Google Home now or arriving soon, and you can test out what the AI can do for you right now.\n\nHere are the three big Gemini changes and how you can use them for home security and general smart home management. It's one of the first examples we've seen of how these massive large language model AIs can affect everyday smart home use, and we can't wait to take a closer look.\n\nNote that these features are available only for English language users, primarily focused on Nest Aware Plus subscribers during the first rollout. They're coming to many more users in time.\n\n1. AI descriptions of what's going on\n\nYou'll need to apply to Google's Public Preview feature to unlock these AI descriptions, so start here. Tyler Lacoma/CNET\n\nTapping into the power of Gemini, Google Home will start providing detailed descriptions along with video clips when a Nest cam or doorbell is activated. That means you don't have to view the video footage directly when you can read a quick description of what Gemini thinks is happening (a man is walking across the street and pauses, etc.).\n\nThis is an opt-in service for those who join Public Preview at this time, so don't expect surprise text pop-ups. We're curious to see how accurate these Gemini descriptions are, as Gemini hasn't been the most reliable conversational AI to this point.\n\nRead more: Best Home Security Cameras of 2024\n\n2. Searching your camera history\n\nGemini can answer questions from your video history, too. Tyler Lacoma/CNET\n\nIf you collect video clips in the Google Home app for an extended period (such as with cloud storage via a Nest Aware subscription), you can now opt into a search function. This isn't any basic search, either. With Gemini, you can ask basic questions to get answers without shuffling through the videos yourself.\n\nOne of Google's simple examples is, \"Was the trash taken to the street yesterday?\" You could also ask the search function about packages or mail deliveries it recently saw, if the dog was taken for a walk yet and any other timely questions.\n\nThis feature is currently rolling out to Nest Aware Plus users, and availability should continue expanding in the coming months.\n\n3. 'Help me create' easy smart home routines\n\nGoogle Home's Automation options are extensive. Tyler Lacoma/CNET\n\nThe \"help me create\" feature, coming soon to the Google Home app, is a more user-friendly option for creating home automations. I'm particularly interested in this feature because setting up home routines (and all the compatibility questions that come with it) is one of the most exhausting parts of managing a smart home.\n\nThis Gemini feature is designed to let you request, in natural language, exactly what you want to happen and then allow Gemini to set it up for you in the Google Home app. So you could say something like, \"I want my door to lock when I leave in the morning,\" or, \"I want the lights to flash when someone rings the doorbell,\" or possibly, \"I want a routine that dims the lights and plays music from my romantic playlist,\" and Gemini will work on putting it all together for you.\n\nNow, to the testmobile! We'll be taking these features for a spin in the coming weeks and let you know how they perform and how they're best used. In the meantime, you can update your Google Home system and play around with the new features yourself to see which pass the vibe check.\n\nThis is also a great time to check out our list of the best indoor security cameras, Google Nest's familiar face technology and the top facial recognition security cameras for your home."

        "article_content": "In the new horror movie, \u201cHeretic,\u201d Hugh Grant plays a diabolical religious skeptic who traps two scared missionaries in his house and tries to violently shake their faith.\n\nWhat starts more as a religious studies lecture slowly morphs into a gory escape room for the two door-knocking members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, underscoring just how well-suited religion can be for terrifying and entertaining thrill-seeking moviegoers.\n\n\u201cI think it is a fascinating religion-related horror as it raises questions about the institution of religion, the patriarchy of religion,\u201d said Stacey Abbott, a film professor at Northumbria University in Newcastle, England, whose research interests include horror, vampires and zombies.\n\n\u201cBut it also questions the nature of faith and confronts the audience with a debate about choice, faith and free will.\u201d\n\nHorror has had a decades-long attraction to religion, Christianity especially in the U.S., with the 1970s \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d and \u201cThe Omen\u201d being prime examples. Beyond the jump scares, the supernatural elements of horror and its sublime nature pair easily with belief and spirituality \u2014 and religion\u2019s exploration of big existential questions, Abbott said. Horror is subversive. Real-life taboo topics and cultural anxieties are fair game.\n\n\u201cIt is a rich canvas for social critique and it can also be a space to reassert traditional values,\u201d Abbott said in an email.\n\nDeath, demons and other tough topics religion and horror address\n\nReligions and horror tackle similar questions about what it means to be human \u2014 how people relate to one another and the world, said Brandon Grafius, a Biblical studies professor at Ecumenical Theological Seminary in Detroit and an expert on Christianity and horror.\n\n\u201cSo much of religion is about how we grapple with the reality of death. \u2026 Helping us make meaning even in the face of that reality,\u201d said Grafius. \u201cHorror really serves that same process, as a way to reflect on death.\u201d\n\nNot only does Christianity translate well for U.S. audiences, it has a lot of raw material for moviemakers to work with, he said.\n\n\u201cChristianity emerged as a strongly dualistic religion, where forces are either good or evil,\u201d Grafius said. \u201cEven though the U.S. is moving away from being a nation dominated by Christianity, we still have that dualism deep in our bones.\u201d\n\nAmong the more recent religion-themed horror films, \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d franchise, including \u201cThe Nun\u201d movies, show paranormal investigators battling demons, Abbott said, while \u201cThe First Omen\u201d and \u201cImmaculate\u201d offer critiques of patriarchal attempts to control women\u2019s bodies.\n\n\u201cThese films seem to be a direct response to many of the debates that are happening in the U.S. these days,\u201d Abbott wrote in her email. \u201cThese different approaches to religion in horror illustrate the way in which the genre is engaging with a very live debate around religion or more specifically how religion is being used to assert control (which is what \u2018Heretic\u2019 is all about).\u201d\n\nGrant, who plays Mr. Reed in the new movie, told The Associated Press that he shared some of his \u201cHeretic\u201d character\u2019s skepticism, although not necessarily from a religious perspective:\n\n\u201cThere is a part of me \u2014 probably a not very attractive part of me \u2014 that likes to smash people\u2019s idols. Anyone I feel is being a bit too smug or too pretentious, I don\u2019t like to see that. I like to just take them apart a little bit.\u201d\n\nHorror can be challenging. It acts as a dark mirror that can reveal things people don\u2019t want to admit and fears they don\u2019t want to face, said the Rev. Ryan Duns, a Jesuit priest and theology chair at Marquette University in Milwaukee.\n\nIf done well, both religion and horror are unsettling, he said.\n\n\u201cReligion, when it unsettles, asks us am I living up to the person I have been called to be or am I complicit in systems of violence, oppression, injustice, going with the status quo,\u201d said Duns, who wrote the \u201cTheology of Horror\u201d and teaches a course on it as well. \u201cIn the horror movie, the monster threatens normality \u2014 threatens to destroy our status quo.\u201d\n\nBut they deviate from there. In horror, there is no way out, Duns said. He pointed out that defeating a movie\u2019s monster doesn\u2019t prevent sequels, hence \u201cJaws 2,\u201d \u201cTerrifier 3,\u201d \u201cReturn of the Killer Tomatoes\u201d and more.\n\nIn Christianity, it is Jesus and the Gospels threatening the status quo, but they offer hope and a way out, he said.\n\nTi West mixes religion into the narrative of his new movie, \u201cMaXXXine,\u201d a horror film about an adult film star trying to break into mainstream movies. West, who also wrote and directed \u201cThe Sacrament,\u201d a horror movie inspired by the Jonestown Massacre in 1978, said he doesn\u2019t actively set out to tell stories with prominent religion narratives, but religion can be ripe for mining.\n\n\u201cIt kind of depends on the story,\u201d West said, \u201cAnything with morality wrapped up into it, they kind of go hand in hand at times. And it\u2019s like religion is such a major part of every culture everywhere that \u2026 I feel like sometimes it\u2019s such a major part of life that gets put aside in movies.\u201d\n\nWhen religion works in horror \u2014 and when it doesn\u2019t\n\nBeyond poor storytelling, the mixing of horror and religion can go wrong if the movie is meant to offend the believers of a particular faith, said Lisa Morton, an award-winning horror author whose written books on Halloween and paranormal history.\n\nBut it can really go right. Morton\u2019s all-time favorite movie is \u201cThe Exorcist,\u201d a holy horror icon and a peak example of the genre. \u201cThe Omen\u201d followed it.\n\n\u201cAll of the contemporary bloodlines kind of trace back through those two,\u201d said Morton. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how they keep getting rebooted over and over.\u201d\n\nAbbott agrees religion should be portrayed respectfully, just as she expects accuracy and respect for science in movies, though not every detail needs to be perfect. \u201cBut some horror films, like exorcism movies, are built upon the fact that they are drawing upon real rituals and then taking them to a more extreme conclusion,\u201d she said.\n\nOsgood Perkins, who wrote and directed \u201cLonglegs,\u201d a horror movie about an occultist serial killer, invented the religious material in his film, piecing together whatever felt right from his imagination and real life.\n\n\u201cI just make it up,\u201d said Perkins. \u201cBut then you catch hold of something like the Bible verse and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, this is really rich.\u2019 Beasts coming out of the sea with heads and horns and crowns and things like that. I didn\u2019t make that up.\u201d\n\nFor Duns, an accurate portrayal of religious rituals and symbols \u2014 without over doing it \u2014 can add heft to a scene.\n\n\u201cThe rituals of the churches have been stylized and lived out for centuries,\u201d Duns said. \u201cWhen movies are silly or are sloppy with it, the power of the gesture and the power of the symbols are lost.\u201d"

AI algorithms are predicting protein structures faster than traditional lab methods, machine learning models are accelerating drug discovery, and advanced computing is enabling scientific simulations of unprecedented complexity.\n\nFor centuries, science and technology have propelled each other forward in a dance of progress. Traditionally, scientific discoveries led the way, with breakthroughs like Newton\u2019s laws enabling the Industrial Revolution, and quantum mechanics paving the path for the digital age. In this paradigm, science predominantly fueled technological advancements.\n\nIn this new paradigm, emerging technological capabilities open doors to deeper scientific understanding, which in turn drives new opportunities for furthering technological enrichment.\n\nThis virtuous flywheel of science and technology has tremendous potential to translate into tangible improvements in our daily lives, from more effective medications to smarter devices and cleaner energy solutions.\n\nA boost to scientific discovery across domains\n\nAI is dramatically shrinking research and experimentation cycles, making discoveries that once took decades to unfold possible within mere years.\n\nIn chemistry and biology, AI-driven algorithms are transforming the way we approach complex challenges, such as predicting molecular structures and interactions. A notable example is DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold, which has revolutionized protein folding by predicting protein structures with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nIn the same fields, consider the realm of personalized medicine and disease control, where AI-driven platforms are identifying potential treatments in a fraction of the time it once took. A prime example of this is the integration of AI with CRISPR gene editing technology. AI models help predict potential off-target effects of CRISPR, making gene editing safer and more precise. This accelerates the development of new therapies, pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in genetic modifications and personalized treatments.\n\nAnother area that benefits greatly from accelerated tech-driven innovation is material sciences. This field is undergoing a transformation through the integration of advanced technologies. New materials, from sustainable alternatives to stronger alloys, are being developed at unprecedented rates thanks to innovative research and technology.\n\nFor industries ranging from aerospace to renewable energy, the implications are vast: faster innovation cycles, reduced R&D costs and a competitive edge in developing materials that meet the demands of tomorrow\u2019s markets.\n\nAnd while AI is the catalyst for the fresh momentum in technology-propelled scientific innovation, other technologies like machine learning and quantum computing are also accelerating this trend. Quantum computing usage is still nascent, yet companies like D-Wave are investing early in areas like quantum annealing, which could solve complex molecular comparison problems faster than classical computers, or gate-based quantum to simulate molecular structures and chemical reactions.\n\nR&D for everyone\n\nThe democratization effect of AI \u2013 broadening access to many types of specialized knowledge and tools by removing many traditional cost and access barriers \u2013 extends also to the overall research and development process itself. Through rapid data analysis, automated experimentation and cost reduction, AI now enables organizations of all sizes to conduct more sophisticated research.\n\nAI agents, acting as tireless research assistants that can analyze data, generate hypotheses and even design experiments autonomously, will soon supplement human work. These AI-powered tools won\u2019t replace human creativity; rather, they will amplify it, allowing researchers to explore ideas at a pace and scale previously reserved for well-funded institutions.\n\nFurthermore, AI is driving open data initiatives and collaborative platforms, allowing researchers worldwide to build on each other\u2019s work more easily. Work like Cognizant\u2019s contribution to Project Resilience in support of UN\u2019s Sustainable Development goals showcase how AI can foster global collaboration on pressing challenges, from climate change to education and pandemic preparedness.\n\nAn invitation to lead\n\nThe acceleration AI and other technologies bring to scientific innovation isn\u2019t just a challenge to keep up with \u2013 it\u2019s an opportunity to redefine industry boundaries and transform everyday life.\n\nLeaders must proactively explore and evaluate how to incorporate technology-fueled R&D into their business strategy and build a culture of experimentation.\n\nR&D culture: To fully leverage the virtuous cycle, R&D functions must evolve. This means not just integrating new technologies, but fostering a culture of experimentation and agility, where innovation is continuous and driven by both scientific discovery and technological capability.\n\nInvestment strategy: View technology-powered R&D as strategic investments with the potential for exponential returns. Investing early in AI, quantum computing and other advanced technologies can position companies at the forefront of their industries.\n\nTalent mix: As the line between science and technology continues to blur, the need for interdisciplinary talent grows. Companies should seek to build teams that combine expertise in traditional scientific domains with skills in AI, data science and computational modeling.\n\nBy embracing this dynamic interplay, leaders have the chance to drive transformative change; not only within their industries, but also in solving some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges \u2013 turning complex problems into breakthroughs that benefit businesses, people, and the planet. As we navigate this evolving landscape, the question isn\u2019t whether to participate in this cycle, but how boldly we choose to engage with it.\n\nRavi Kumar S. is the Chief Executive Officer at Cognizant and Simone Rodriguez is the Deputy Chief of Staff to the CEO at Cognizant\n\nThis article was originally published in the World Economic Forum."

        "article_content": "Physicists have made a groundbreaking discovery that challenges the traditional understanding of light by demonstrating that laser beams can cast shadows. In an experiment led by Dr. Raphael A. Abrahao from Brookhaven National Laboratory, researchers observed that under specific conditions, one laser beam can block another, effectively creating a visible shadow.\n\n\"Laser light casting a shadow was previously thought impossible since light usually passes through other light without interacting,\" said Dr. Abrahao, according to The Debrief. This counterintuitive finding opens new doors in optics and photonics, prompting scientists to reconsider foundational concepts in physics.\n\nThe idea for the experiment emerged from an informal conversation among scientists. Members of the team noticed that 3D visualization software depicted laser beams casting shadows, sometimes showing them as opaque cylinders that create a shadow in light. This unusual observation sparked a discussion that led to designing an experiment to see if they could create a visible shadow with a laser beam, a phenomenon that challenges foundational concepts in physics.\n\n\"What began as a playful reflection transformed into a fascinating discovery, expanding the understanding of interactions between light and matter,\" as reported by SciencePost. Inspired by numerical simulations where lasers were represented as solid cylinders, the team wanted to test the hypothesis in the laboratory, leading to the creation of a visible shadow with a laser beam.\n\nTo demonstrate this phenomenon, the researchers conducted an experiment using a ruby crystal cube. They shone a green laser beam through the cube while illuminating it perpendicularly with blue light. When the green laser passed through the ruby crystal, it created a region that absorbed more blue light, effectively casting a \"shadow\" shaped exactly like the green laser beam. This shadow was visible to the naked eye, followed the contours of the laser beam, and moved with its source.\n\nThe key to this effect lies in ruby's unusual optical properties. Materials like ruby exhibit nonlinear responses, meaning their interaction with light changes based on the light's intensity. Specifically, the phenomenon relies on a property known as reverse saturation of absorption, where the material absorbs more light at higher intensities rather than becoming more transparent. This counterintuitive behavior is critical to producing the shadow.\n\nWhen the green laser passes through the ruby, its photons excite specific energy levels within the crystal, driving some of the ruby crystal's electrons into an excited state. This excitation alters the crystal's absorption characteristics, selectively blocking portions of the blue illumination beam. As a result, a darker region appears where the green laser had passed, mimicking the shadow of an opaque object.\n\nBy adjusting the power of the green laser, the researchers were able to change the induced resistance to blue light and vary the intensity of the shadow produced. They achieved a maximum contrast of about 22%, comparable to the shadow cast by leaves on a sunny day. \"We experimentally measure the dependence of the contrast of the shadow on the power of the laser beam, finding a maximum of approximately 22%, similar to that of a shadow of a tree on a sunny day,\" the researchers explained, as reported by The Debrief.\n\nThe researchers developed a theoretical model and showed that it could accurately predict the shadow contrast, quantifying the effect using mathematical models and advanced imaging techniques. Their findings aligned closely with theoretical predictions, solidifying the experimental results and highlighting the robustness of the laser shadow phenomenon. \"Our demonstration of a very counterintuitive optical effect invites us to reconsider our notion of shadow,\" Dr. Abrahao added.\n\nThis discovery has potential real-world applications in the field of optics and laser technologies. According to Dr. Abrahao, \"This discovery expands our understanding of light-matter interactions and opens up new possibilities for utilizing light in ways we hadn't considered before.\" One potential use would be the creation of systems where one laser beam controls another beam. In optical switches or devices requiring precise control of light, such as high-power lasers, this effect could be used to modulate light transmission with great precision.

The ability to cast shadows with laser beams might revolutionize fields like lithography and 3D imaging. \"Potential applications can be envisioned in areas such as optical switching, controllable shade or transmission, control of the opaqueness of light with light, and lithography,\" the researchers added.\n\nThe research team plans to investigate other materials, such as alexandrite, and other laser wavelengths that might produce similar effects, aiming to explore the potential scalability of this phenomenon for industrial applications. Each new material could offer unique properties and unprecedented technological possibilities. They also aim to refine their theoretical models to better understand the underlying physics.\n\nThis breakthrough challenges long-standing assumptions about the nature of light and shadows. While photons\u2014the particles of light\u2014are massless and typically pass through one another without interaction, this experiment shows that light can behave as if it has mass, casting a shadow under specific conditions. As researchers continue pushing the boundaries of optical science, the possibilities for innovation could be limitless.\n\n\"This experiment redefines our understanding of what a shadow is\u2014under the right conditions, laser beams can cast a shadow,\" the researchers concluded. It shows that a phenomenon as familiar as a shadow can still reveal fascinating secrets. This result is also a reminder of the importance of scientific curiosity: what initially seemed to be a simple theoretical question led to a major advance.\n\nThe research has been accepted for publication in Optica and can be found on the pre-publish site arXiv, representing an important contribution to research in the field of optics and light physics.\n\nThis article was written in collaboration with generative AI company Alchemiq"

        "article_content": "Science is the systematic study of the world around us. It involves observation, questioning, understanding, and gathering evidence to make conclusions. Science isn't a subject to be learnt but a way of understanding the world.\n\nTherefore, science education must focus on developing a scientific mindset and capabilities, not merely imparting facts. Today, science education is likened to acquiring facts and figures about already discovered knowledge.\n\nadvertisement\n\nStudents are conditioned to view science as a collection of information rather than an active, exploratory process.\n\nTo change this perspective, it is crucial to reimagine the traditional science classroom as a space for exploration, experimentation, and collaboration students actively engage with science as a process of discovery.\n\nThis shift not only enriches their learning experience but also contributes to the broader goals of fostering scientific advancement that is sustainable and beneficial to humanity at large.\n\nFOCUS ON THE PROCESS OF SCIENCE\n\nFocusing on teaching the results of scientific discoveries-such as facts, principles, and applications-while neglecting the process through which these discoveries were made, the learning experience remains incomplete.\n\nThe scientific process-observing, hypothesising, experimenting and validating conclusions-is just as necessary as the knowledge gained. This requires a focus on how to \"do science\". Students must learn to base their conclusions on evidence and remain open to new ideas, just as scientists do.\n\nCOMPETENCY-CENTRIC LEARNING AND ACTIVE LEARNING PEDAGOGIES\n\nScience education should focus on developing competencies leading to abilities like problem-solving, critical thinking, and investigative skills. These abilities are best nurtured through experiential learning and inquiry-based pedagogy, where students actively engage in hands-on exploration rather than passively receiving information.\n\nFrom a young age, students should be encouraged to investigate and explore, with the practice of \"doing\" science driving their learning. This approach supports cognitive development and also cultivates a lifelong habit of inquiry and discovery.\n\nCOMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION\n\nEffective communication is crucial for meaningful science education. Without the ability to express ideas, share findings, and engage in discussions, students miss out on opportunities to deepen their understanding and refine their thinking.\n\nCurrently, science communication in many classrooms is confined to students providing predetermined answers to existing questions, which limits opportunities for collaborative learning.\n\nTo truly enhance the learning experience, students should be encouraged to communicate openly with one another, exchange insights, and collaborate on scientific explorations. Peer learning reinforces key concepts and also sparks new ideas and perspectives.\n\nBy cultivating an environment that values communication and collaboration, we can create a classroom culture where students are more engaged, motivated, and empowered to take an active role in their learning.\n\nINTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO LEARNING\n\nScience in the initial stages of learning has to be presented holistically rather than deepening the boundaries of conveniences created, like physics, chemistry, and biology, among others. An interdisciplinary approach is essential to help students appreciate the beauty and interconnectedness of nature that might otherwise go unnoticed and evolve holistic solutions.\n\nINTEGRATING TECHNOLOGY AND HANDS-ON LEARNING\n\nLeveraging modern technology, students now have access to tools that allow them to visualise and experience scientific concepts in ways that would be impossible through traditional methods. Technology empowers students to learn based on their observations and experiences, fostering a more personalised approach to education. Through a combination of technology, hands-on tools, and real-world applications, learning experiences can be curated to make learning more relevant and meaningful.\n\nSCIENCE LEARNING SPACES\n\nScience classrooms should be reimagined as spaces that encourage students to be active learners rather than just passive recipients of information. Instead of merely verifying facts through traditional experiments, students should be inspired to experiment and engage in hands-on activities that enable exploration.\n\nTraditional verification-based experiments, which require students to reproduce known outcomes, limit their potential for true discovery and creative thinking. To help students gain a better understanding of science, educators should encourage exploration, allowing students to investigate concepts and make their own discoveries.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhile research-grade equipment may not be essential, students should have access to materials that allow them to understand scientific concepts at their developmental level, ensuring that learning is both relevant and engaging.\n\nBy making exploration a core component of the learning process, teachers can ignite a lifelong passion for discovery and equip students with the skills to think critically and innovate.\n\nFACILITATING LEARNING, NOT TEACHING\n\nIn this age, where access to information is not a barrier, educators should be trained as facilitators to foster building competencies in students rather than passing on information to them. Encouraging the process of exploration, curating experiences to enhance curiosity and leverage skills in the students, and enabling the process of discovery are essential.\n\nIn a rapidly evolving global learning landscape, the need for transformation in education is more urgent than ever. It is imperative that we make a concerted effort to embrace these changes, ensuring that our educational systems remain relevant, effective, and aligned with the future needs of learners.\n\nOnly through concerted efforts can we bring about a change that will equip future generations to thrive in a dynamic world.\n\nArticle by Vallish Herur, Managing Trustee, Prayoga"
