            "article_content": "MIT Technology Review got to try out Astra in a closed-door live demo last week. It was a stunning experience, but there\u2019s a gulf between polished promo and live demo.\n\nAstra uses Gemini 2.0\u2019s built-in agent framework to answer questions and carry out tasks via text, speech, image, and video, calling up existing Google apps like Search, Maps, and Lens when it needs to. \u201cIt\u2019s merging together some of the most powerful information retrieval systems of our time,\u201d says Bibo Xu, product manager for Astra.\n\nGemini 2.0 and Astra are joined by Mariner, a new agent built on top of Gemini that can browse the web for you; Jules, a new Gemini-powered coding assistant; and Gemini for Games, an experimental assistant that you can chat to and ask for tips as you play video games.\n\n(And let\u2019s not forget that in the last week Google DeepMind also announced Veo, a new video generation model; Imagen 3, a new version of its image generation model; and Willow, a new kind of chip for quantum computers. Whew. Meanwhile, CEO Demis Hassabis was in Sweden yesterday receiving his Nobel Prize.)\n\nGoogle DeepMind claims that Gemini 2.0 is twice as fast as the previous version, Gemini 1.5, and outperforms it on a number of standard benchmarks, including MMLU-Pro, a large set of multiple-choice questions designed to test the abilities of large language models across a range of subjects, from math and physics to health, psychology, and philosophy.\n\nBut the margins between top-end models like Gemini 2.0 and those from rival labs like OpenAI and Anthropic are now slim. These days, advances in large language models are less about how good they are and more about what you can do with them.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where agents come in.\n\nHands on with Project Astra\n\nLast week I was taken through an unmarked door on an upper floor of a building in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross district into a room with strong secret-project vibes. The word \u201cASTRA\u201d was emblazoned in giant letters across one wall. Xu\u2019s dog, Charlie, the project\u2019s de facto mascot, roamed between desks where researchers and engineers were busy building a product that Google is betting its future on."

            "article_content": "American computer scientist and professor Alan Perlis famously said that a year spent in AI (artificial intelligence) was enough to make one believe in God\u2026\n\nIt might be a little too (uncomfortably) close to the truth, considering that now questions are arising about the societal and ethical implications of AI. However, there is no denying that AI also has the potential to transform healthcare and well-being.\n\nWe are talking specifically about the Safe Delivery App, a training and learning tool and a job aid, all combined into one, for midwives and other healthcare professionals.\n\nBackstory\n\nA major chunk of all newborn and maternal deaths can be prevented if women receive quality healthcare. However, there is a lack of almost a million midwives around the world. What\u2019s more, many people who currently practice midwifery do not possess the necessary knowledge or skills, making the situation all the more critical. This is an urgent goal, considering nearly 6,400 newborns and 800 women are dying every daily day from birth-related and pregnancy complications.\n\nThis was the basis of thought for Finnish AI startup Neuvo Inc. Global and International NGO Maternity Foundation, who are currently exploring this potential. They have joined hands to develop a unique AI-powered application to help ensure safer childbirth in settings with fewer resources.\n\nAll About the Safe Delivery App\n\nThe Maternity Foundation carefully used technology for over a decade to build midwifery skills and knowledge via the Safe Delivery App. This app, which is free to download and use even offline, ensures that midwives living and working in fragile and poor areas, with most neonatal and maternal births, have access to it.\n\nThis learning and training tool-cum-job aid for midwives and other healthcare workers is not only an essential and critical guide to handling birth delivery but also other common complications. It does so by using descriptions of practical procedures and animated instruction videos, among other features.\n\nWith support from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN\u2019s reproductive and sexual health agency, and other key partners, the Safe Delivery app has now reached more than 435,000 healthcare working professionals across more than 70 countries. That being said, the Maternity Foundation is always looking for ways to advance and boost this useful tool further.\n\nThe NeMa Smart Bot: A Step Further\n\nWith the Maternity Foundation\u2019s vision in mind, Neuvo Inc. Global took the second step in this direction. It developed the NeMa Smart Bot, an AI-powered conversational smart bot, which will eventually be integrated into the Safe Delivery App. The objective?\n\nTo answer pregnancy and birth-related questions instantly. Since time is critical when it comes to managing complications surrounding pregnancy and birth, the idea and hope are that this smart bot will elevate the assistance provided through the app to midwives and other healthcare professionals, ultimately aiding safer births.\n\nWhat about the authenticity of the information? The very objective of the app has been evidence-based guidance right from the outset. Both organizations have ensured that the answers that the NeMa smart bot provides are based on audited clinical material and have been scientifically verified. In fact, the content behind the smart bot\u2019s answers was screened and eventually cleared by the clinical team at the Maternity Foundation.\n\nPlus, they were even aligned with the country\u2019s national guidelines. In other words, the smart bot has been developed in and as a closed system, as opposed to open-ended answers generated via internet searches. And since it also works offline, it still remains accurate in areas with no or limited connectivity.\n\nThe Effect\n\nCan this useful AI tool help bridge important healthcare gaps in India? Quite possibly.\n\n\n\nSince the Maternity Foundation has focused on strengthening midwifery skills and knowledge in those parts of the country that lag behind others, in tandem with Indian authorities, they knew what they were doing. As a matter of fact, the NeMa smart bot was pilot-tested with Indian authorities in two rounds over the course of 2023, along with support from UNFPA and the pharma company Organon.\n\nIn case you missed:"

The first short videos, on topics such as nuclear science-based solutions to drought, cancer and plastic pollution, will be released in January across EMEA, both on television and online.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said: \u201cWe are excited to work with the Discovery Channel to help even more people learn about the amazing world of nuclear science. From the IAEA\u2019s unique laboratories, our scientists are using radiation to recycle plastics and create plants that can better withstand climate change, they\u2019re researching new targeted forms of cancer therapy, and much more. In the last couple of years alone, the IAEA sent seeds into space to see if we can develop even stronger variants; we sent scientists to Antarctica to collect accurate data about plastic pollution and we helped conservationists use radiotracers to combat rhino poaching!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are so many fascinating stories to tell about the cutting-edge nuclear techniques through which the IAEA assists countries in the fight against hunger, disease, climate change and energy poverty, to name just a few, and we are very happy to be telling them together with the Discovery Channel.\u201d\n\nIAEA Director of Communications Sophie Boutaud de la Combe added: \u201cWe are very proud of the films we make at the IAEA, where we have built a dedicated video team with award winning cinematographers and are delighted that the Discovery Channel will use our original footage to reach an even bigger audience. Accurate and engaging story-telling can do a lot to explain the benefits of nuclear science and technology in our daily lives.\u201d\n\nWatch original IAEA films on the IAEA YouTube channel here."

The specimen, a near-perfectly preserved male, was discovered washed ashore on a South Island beach, marking a monumental moment for both marine science and Maori cultural heritage.\n\nThe dissection revealed fascinating biological details, including nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, and vestigial teeth that provide insights into its evolutionary past. However, the whale's broken jaw and bruising led scientists to believe that head trauma might be the cause of its death, though the exact circumstances remain unknown.\n\nThe collaboration between scientists and local Maori communities was a unique aspect of this project, integrating Indigenous knowledge into the scientific process. Post-dissection, the whale's jawbone and teeth will be preserved by the Maori tribe, with 3D replicas to be displayed in museums. This event underscores New Zealand's status as a whale-stranding hotspot and emphasizes the cultural significance of whales as a taonga, or treasure, to the Maori people.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "NurPhoto / Contributor / Getty Images\n\nWith the holiday season upon us, many companies are finding ways to take advantage through deals, promotions, or other campaigns. OpenAI has found a way to participate with its \"12 days of OpenAI\" event series.\n\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI announced via an X post that starting on Dec. 5, the company would host 12 days of live streams and release \"a bunch of new things, big and small,\" according to the post.\n\nAlso: OpenAI's Sora AI video generator is here - how to try it\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the campaign, as well as a round-up of every day's drops.\n\nWhat are the '12 days of OpenAI'?\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a bit more details about the event, which kicked off at 10 a.m. PT on Dec. 5 and will occur daily for 12 weekdays with a live stream featuring a launch or demo. The launches will be both \"big ones\" or \"stocking stuffers,\" according to Altman.\n\nWhat has been dropped so far?\n\nThursday, December 12\n\nWhen the live stream started, OpenAI addressed the elephant in the room -- the fact that the company's live stream went down the day before. OpenAI apologized for the inconvenience and said its team is working on a post-mortem to be posted later today.\n\nThen it got straight into the news -- another highly-anticipated announcement:\n\nAdvanced Voice Mode now has screen-sharing and visual capabilities, meaning it can assist with the context of what it is viewing, whether that be from your phone camera or what's on your screen.\n\nThese capabilities build on what Advanced Voice could already do very well -- engaging in casual conversation as a human would. The natural-like conversations can be interrupted, have multi-turns, and understand non-linear trains of thought.\n\nIn the demo, the user gets directions from ChatGPT's Advanced Voice on how to make a cup of coffee. As the demoer goes through the steps, ChatGPT is verbally offering insights and directions.\n\nThere's another bonus for the Christmas season: Users can access a new Santa voice. To activate it, all users have to do is click on the snowflake icon. Santa is rolling out throughout today everywhere that users can access ChatGPT voice mode. The first time you talk to Santa, your usage limits reset, even if you have reached the limit already, so you can have a conversation with him.\n\nVideo and screen sharing are rolling out in the latest mobile apps starting today and throughout next week to all Team users and most Pro and Plus subscribers. Pro and Plus subscribers in Europe will get access \"as soon as we can,\" and Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next year.\n\nWednesday, December 11\n\nApple released iOS 18.2 today. The release includes integrations with ChatGPT across Siri, Writing Tools, and Visual Intelligence. As a result, today's live stream focused on walking through the integration.\n\nSiri can now recognize when you ask questions outside its scope that could benefit from being answered by ChatGPT instead. In those instances, it will ask if you'd like to process the query using ChatGPT. Before any request is sent to ChatGPT, a message notifying the user and asking for permission will always appear, placing control in the user's hands as much as possible.\n\n\n\nVisual Intelligence refers to a new feature for the iPhone 16 lineup that users can access by tapping the Camera Control button. Once the camera is open, users can point it at something and search the web with Google, or use ChatGPT to learn more about what they are viewing or perform other tasks such as translating or summarizing text.\n\nWriting Tools now features a new \"Compose\" tool, which allows users to create text from scratch by leveraging ChatGPT. With the feature, users can even generate images using DALL-E.\n\nAll of the above features are subject to ChatGPT's daily usage limits, the same way that users would reach limits while using the free version of the model on ChatGPT. Users can choose whether or not to enable the ChatGPT integration in Settings.\n\nRead more about it here: iOS 18.2 rolls out to iPhones: Try these 6 new AI features today\n\nTuesday, December 10\n\nCanvas is coming to all web users, regardless of plan, in GPT-4o, meaning it is no longer just available in beta for ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nCanvas has been built into GPT-4o natively, meaning you can just call on Canvas instead of having to go to the toggle on the model selector.\n\nThe Canvas interface is the same as what users saw in beta in ChatGPT Plus, with a table on the left hand side that shows the Q+A exchange and a right-hand tab that shows your project, displaying all of the edits as they go, as well as shortcuts.\n\nCanvas can also be used with custom GPTs. It is turned on by default when creating a new one, and there is an option to add Canvas to existing GPTs.\n\nCanvas also has the ability to run Python code directly in Canvas, allowing ChatGPT to execute coding tasks such as fixing bugs.\n\nRead more about it here: I'm a ChatGPT power user - and Canvas is still my favorite productivity feature a month later\n\nMonday, December 9\n\nOpenAI teased the third-day announcement as \"something you've been waiting for,\" followed by the much-anticipated drop of its video model -- Sora. Here's what you need to know:\n\nKnown as Sora Turbo, the video model is smarter than the February model that was previewed.\n\nAccess is coming in the US later today; users need only ChatGPT Plus and Pro.\n\nSora can generate video-to-video, text-to-video, and more.\n\nChatGPT Plus users can generate up to 50 videos per month at 480p resolution or fewer videos at 720p. The Pro Plan offers 10x more usage.\n\nThe new model is smarter and cheaper than the previewed February model.\n\nSora features an explore page where users can view each other's creations. Users can click on any video to see how it was created.\n\nA live demo showed the model in use. The demo-ers entered a prompt and picked aspect ratio, duration, and even presets. I found the live demo video results to be realistic and stunning.\n\nOpenAI also unveiled Storyboard, a tool that lets users generate inputs for every frame in a sequence.\n\nFriday, December 6:\n\nOn the second day of \"shipmas,\" OpenAI expanded access to its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research Program:\n\nThe Reinforcement Fine-Tuning program allows developers and machine learning engineers to fine-tune OpenAI models to \"excel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks,\" according to OpenAI.\n\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning refers to a customization technique in which developers can define a model's behavior by inputting tasks and grading the output. The model then uses this feedback as a guide to improve, becoming better at reasoning through similar problems, and enhancing overall accuracy.\n\nOpenAI encourages research institutes, universities, and enterprises to apply to the program, particularly those that perform narrow sets of complex tasks, could benefit from the assistance of AI, and perform tasks that have an objectively correct answer.\n\nSpots are limited; interested applicants can apply by filling out this form.\n\nOpenAI aims to make Reinforcement Fine-Tuning publicly available in early 2025.\n\nThursday, December 5:\n\nOpenAI started with a bang, unveiling two major upgrades to its chatbot: a new tier of ChatGPT subscription, ChatGPT Pro, and the full version of the company's o1 model.\n\nThe full version of o1:\n\nWill be better for all kinds of prompts, beyond math and science\n\nWill make major mistakes about 34% less often than o1-preview, while thinking about 50% faster\n\nRolls out today, replacing o1-preview to all ChatGPT Plus and now Pro users\n\nLets users input images, as seen in the demo, to provide multi-modal reasoning (reasoning on both text and images)\n\nChatGPT Pro:\n\nIs meant for ChatGPT Plus superusers, granting them unlimited access to the best OpenAI has to offer, including unlimited access to OpenAI o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Mode\n\nFeatures o1 pro mode, which uses more computing to reason through the hardest science and math problems\n\nCosts $200 per month\n\nWhere can you access the live stream?\n\nThe live streams are held on the OpenAI website, and posted to its YouTube channel immediately after. To make access easier, OpenAI will also post a link to the live stream on its X account 10 minutes before it starts, which will be at approximately 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET daily.\n\nWhat can you expect?\n\nThe releases remain a surprise, but many anticipate that Sora, OpenAI's video model initially announced last February, will be launched as part of one of the bigger drops. Since that first announcement, the model has been available to a select group of red teamers and testers and was leaked last week by some testers over grievances about \"unpaid labor,\" according to reports.\n\nAlso: OpenAI's o1 lies more than any major AI model. Why that matters\n\nOther rumored releases include a new, fuller version of the company's o1 LLM with more advanced reasoning capabilities, and a Santa voice for OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode, per code spotted by users only a couple of weeks ago under the codename \"Straw.\""

            "article_content": "White & Case's Public Company Advisory Group has conducted a survey of publicly filed insider trading policies to assess emerging trends with respect to key insider trading policy terms. Starting with Form 10-K/20-F annual reports for June 30 fiscal year end companies, new SEC rules1 (under Item 408 of Regulation S-K) now require companies to disclose whether they have adopted an insider trading policy, and, if so, to file such policy as Exhibit 19 to their Form 10-K2 or Exhibit 11 to their Form 20-F. Companies with calendar year-end fiscal years will be required to meet these new insider trading policy requirements in their upcoming annual reports filed in early 2025.3\n\nWhite & Case Survey of Filed Insider Trading Policies\n\nWhite & Case has surveyed the insider trading policies recently filed by 50 public companies, including 25 Fortune 100 companies and 25 mid-cap companies. At their most basic level, a U.S. public company's insider trading policy prohibits insiders who possess material non-public information (\"MNPI\") from purchasing, selling, or otherwise trading in that company's securities, or in the securities of a related company about which the insider has MNPI as a result of serving as an employee, director or officer of his/her own company. They also typically prohibit \"tipping,\" or providing MNPI to anyone outside of the company and recommending that they purchase, sell, or otherwise trade in the company's securities or the securities of a related company. Our survey found the trends set forth below.\n\nHow long after its release is MNPI considered \"public\" (outside of quarterly blackout periods)?\n\nFor information to be considered \"public,\" it must be broadly disseminated, and the public market must be given adequate time to absorb and respond to the information. Companies adopt a variety of approaches on how much time should pass after the company's release of material information via broad dissemination before that information is no longer \"non-public.\" The data we found showcases this variety.\n\nTime Period for MNPI to be considered \"public\" Number of Companies Percentage of Companies One trading day 22 44% Two trading days 21 42% Three trading days 1 2% Not specified 6 12%\n\nWhen do quarterly \"blackout periods\" start and end, and who is subject to them?\n\nAll companies surveyed impose a quarterly blackout period, or a set period running from sometime near the end of a quarter until the release of financial results for such quarter, when all or certain insiders are prohibited from trading in the company's stock given their access to MNPI about those results.\n\nStart of quarterly blackout period\n\nThe start date of a quarterly blackout period should be determined in part by when insiders might first have knowledge of the company's quarterly results, which can in turn depend upon a company's particular data accumulation and financial close processes and timeline for preparing and accumulating consolidated quarterly financial information.\n\nStart of quarterly blackout period Number of Companies Percentage of Companies ~ Two weeks before quarter end 26 52% ~ Three to four weeks before quarter end 11 22% ~ Five to six weeks before quarter end 4 8% ~ One week before quarter end 3 6% Last day of quarter 3 6% Other 3 6%\n\nEnd of quarterly blackout period\n\nThe end date for a quarterly blackout period is tied to the release of quarterly financial information, but the precise date depends on when information is considered to be broadly disseminated in the public market. To be clear, in every policy that specifically addresses both points, the end date for quarterly blackouts is the same time period for when a company considers MNPI in general to be \"public.\"\n\nEnd of quarterly blackout period Number of Companies Percentage of Companies One full trading day after earnings are released 27 54% Two full trading days after earnings are released 20 40% Three full trading days after earnings are released 1 2% Company discretion 2 4%\n\nInsiders subject to quarterly blackouts\n\nA significant majority of companies surveyed do not subject all insiders to quarterly blackouts. Instead, they only impose quarterly blackouts on directors and Section 16 officers/executive officers, along with other employees with access to quarterly financial information.\n\nGroup of insiders subject to quarterly blackout periods Number of companies Percentage of companies Directors, Section 16 officers/executive officers and other designated employees with access to quarterly financial information 43 86% Directors, Section 16 officers/executive officers and all other employees 7 14%\n\nWho is subject to preclearance procedures?\n\nAll but one surveyed company imposes preclearance procedures, or procedures by which all or certain insiders must receive pre-approval from the administrator of the policy before trading. The insiders subject to preclearance procedures largely, but not entirely, align with those who are subject to a company's quarterly blackout periods.\n\nGroup of insiders subject to preclearance procedures Number of companies Percentage of companies Directors, Section 16 officers/executive officers and other designated employees with access to quarterly financial information 43 86% Directors, Section 16 officers/executive officers and all other employees 2 4% Directors and Section 16 officers/executive officers only 4 8% Not addressed in insider trading policy4 1 2%\n\nHow are hedging and pledging addressed?\n\nAll but one company surveyed prohibits hedging and/or pledging in some form. The overwhelming majority extend this prohibition across all insiders, and allow no exceptions, with only a small minority of two companies providing exceptions or distinguishing treatment of hedging and pledging among categories of insiders. One of these companies allows for an exception to the prohibition on pledging where a person wishes to pledge company securities as collateral for a loan (not including margin debt) and clearly demonstrates the financial capacity to repay the loan without resort to the pledged securities. The other company allows hedging and pledging for any insider if the transaction is for legitimate non-speculative purposes and the insider obtains prior approval from the relevant parties at the company.\n\nGroup of insiders Who is prohibited from hedging/pledging? Are exceptions allowed? Number of companies Percentage of companies Number of companies Percentage of companies All insiders (including all employees) 46 88% 2 4% Directors, Section 16 officers/executive officers and other designated employees, with all other insiders strongly discouraged5 2 4% 0 0% Directors and Section 16 officers/executive officers only 1 2% 0 0% Not addressed in insider trading policy 1 2% n/a n/a\n\nHow are gifts addressed?\n\nTreatment of gifts of company securities in insider trading policies has become a hot topic recently, in part due to the SEC's statement on gifts in dicta in a recent rule adopting release.6 The vast majority (72%) of companies explicitly address gifts, with varying treatments.\n\nHow are gifts treated? Number of companies Percentage of companies The same as other trading activity (prohibited when insider has MNPI or is subject to blackout; requires preclearance) 28 56% Allowed even when the insider is in possession of MNPI or in a blackout, unless the insider has reason to believe that the recipient will sell at a time when the insider has MNPI 11 22% Treatment depends on the circumstances; insider must consult with the legal department and all Section 16 officers must pre-clear gifts 1 2% Charitable and non-profit gifting by directors and officers is permitted at any time (no preclearance required) 1 2% Not explicitly addressed 14 28%\n\nHow are other transactions addressed?\n\nNet exercises of options: 56% of companies surveyed explicitly carve out net exercise of options (without any corresponding market sales) as exempt from the restrictions in the insider trading policy.\n\n56% of companies surveyed explicitly carve out net exercise of options (without any corresponding market sales) as exempt from the restrictions in the insider trading policy. ESPP purchases: 56% of companies surveyed explicitly carve out employee stock purchase plan purchased made via regular payroll deductions (some companies may choose not to address this because they do not have employee stock purchase plans).\n\n56% of companies surveyed explicitly carve out employee stock purchase plan purchased made via regular payroll deductions (some companies may choose not to address this because they do not have employee stock purchase plans). 401(k) plan purchases: 36% of companies surveyed explicitly carve out 401(k) plan purchases in company stock made via regular payroll deductions (some companies may choose not to address this because they do not offer investment of their employees' 401(k) plans in company stock).\n\n36% of companies surveyed explicitly carve out 401(k) plan purchases in company stock made via regular payroll deductions (some companies may choose not to address this because they do not offer investment of their employees' 401(k) plans in company stock). Changes in the form of beneficial ownership: While a feature of some policies, none of the policies in our survey specifically addresses changes in the form of ownership only.\n\nHow is shadow trading addressed ?\n\n\"Shadow trading\" is the practice of an insider trading shares of another company that is \"economically linked\" to the insider's company, while in possession of MNPI about the insider's company. Companies are \"economically linked\" when the MNPI about the insider's company could influence the market price of shares of the other company. The SEC recently successfully prosecuted SEC v. Matthew Panuwat, an insider trading case based on shadow trading.7 This may cause companies to reconsider the extent to which their insider trading prohibitions apply to securities of other companies, considering the potential reputational consequences of an insider trading action. In our survey, 18% of companies specifically prohibit \"shadow trading\" by insiders.8\n\nWho administers the policy?\n\nPolicy administrator Number of Companies Percentage of Companies General counsel (GC)/chief legal officer 28 56% Compliance officer 8 16% Corporate secretary's office/corporate governance department 7 14% Chief executive officer (CEO) 6 12% Chief financial officer (CFO) 6 12% Legal/compliance department 5 10% In-house securities counsel 2 4%\n\nAre waivers of the policy permitted, and if so, who can approve them?\n\nA majority (56%) of companies surveyed permit waivers of the policy, but differ with respect to the individual or group of individuals approving these waivers.\n\nApprover of waivers Number of Companies Percentage of Companies GC/assistant GC/chief legal officer 12 24% Compliance officer 7 14% Corporate law department 3 6% Corporate secretary 2 4% CFO 1 2% Audit committee 1 2% Board of directors 1 2%\n\nDoes the policy explicitly apply post-termination?\n\nHalf of the companies surveyed explicitly extend the application of the policy past the date an individual ceases to be employed by or serving the company, while the other half do not.\n\nExplicit post-termination application Number of companies Percentage of companies Yes, to all insiders, until any MNPI they possess has become public or is no longer material (for those subject to blackouts, the later of the opening of the blackout period or until MNPI becomes public or is no longer material) 22 44% Yes, to Section 16 officers and designated employees only, until the later of 90 days or when any MNPI they possess has become public or is no longer material 2 4% Yes, to all insiders, without specifying a period 1 2% No 25 50%\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile this preliminary data is instructive, it is based on a limited sample selected only from companies with a June 30 or September 30 fiscal year end; policies filed in the upcoming Form 10-K/20-F reporting season will provide a more robust picture of market practices and procedures. In addition, companies' policies should and will vary based on their specific circumstances and needs, and we expect policies and practices to evolve as companies continue to update and refine their policies in light of emerging market trends.\n\n1 Our alert on these rules is available here.\n\n2 This exhibit filing requirement is satisfied if all of the company's insider trading policies and procedures are included in its \"code of ethics,\" as defined in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, and the company has filed its code of ethics as Exhibit 14 to its Form 10-K pursuant to Item 406(c)(1) and Item 601(b)(14). In these cases, the exhibit index should list Exhibit 19, Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, and include a statement similar to the following: \"Included in Exhibit 14.\"\n\n3 Companies with a June 30 or September 30 fiscal-year end were already required to include this disclosure in their recently-filed Form 10-Ks/20-Fs.\n\n4 This company references additional policy documents that may be supplied to company personnel who are notified that they are subject to such additional policies.\n\n5 One of these companies also requires any insider to preclear a hedge or pledge of company securities.\n\n6 In the context of the 2023 rule change for Section 16 reporting of gifts, the SEC provided commentary on gifts, noting \"that a gift followed closely by a sale, under conditions where the value at the time of donation and sale affects the tax or other benefits obtained by the donor, may raise the same policy concerns as more common forms of insider trading\u2026.[B]ecause the donor is in a position to benefit from the asset's value at the time of donation and sale, the donor may be motivated to give at a time when the donor is aware of [MNPI] and may expect the donee to sell prior to the disclosure of such information.\" The SEC also stated that \"a gift made with the knowledge that the donee will soon sell can be seen as in effect a sale for cash followed by gift of the cash.\"\n\n7 For details on the case, see our prior alerts here and here, and for a discussion of the implications of the case for insider trading policies, see here.\n\n8 The 18% of companies surveyed that specifically prohibit \"shadow trading\" by insiders were mainly part of the group of established Fortune 100 companies."

From the IAEA\u2019s unique laboratories, our scientists are using radiation to recycle plastics and create plants that can better withstand climate change, they\u2019re researching new targeted forms of cancer therapy, and much more. In the last couple of years alone, the IAEA sent seeds into space to see if we can develop even stronger variants; we sent scientists to Antarctica to collect accurate data about plastic pollution and we helped conservationists use radiotracers to combat rhino poaching!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are so many fascinating stories to tell about the cutting-edge nuclear techniques through which the IAEA assists countries in the fight against hunger, disease, climate change and energy poverty, to name just a few, and we are very happy to be telling them together with the Discovery Channel.\u201d\n\nIAEA Director of Communications Sophie Boutaud de la Combe added: \u201cWe are very proud of the films we make at the IAEA, where we have built a dedicated video team with award winning cinematographers and are delighted that the Discovery Channel will use our original footage to reach an even bigger audience.

The specimen, a near-perfectly preserved male, was discovered washed ashore on a South Island beach, marking a monumental moment for both marine science and Maori cultural heritage.\n\nThe dissection revealed fascinating biological details, including nine stomach chambers containing remnants of squid and parasitic worms, and vestigial teeth that provide insights into its evolutionary past. However, the whale's broken jaw and bruising led scientists to believe that head trauma might be the cause of its death, though the exact circumstances remain unknown.\n\nThe collaboration between scientists and local Maori communities was a unique aspect of this project, integrating Indigenous knowledge into the scientific process. Post-dissection, the whale's jawbone and teeth will be preserved by the Maori tribe, with 3D replicas to be displayed in museums. This event underscores New Zealand's status as a whale-stranding hotspot and emphasizes the cultural significance of whales as a taonga, or treasure, to the Maori people.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "Check out Sequentum Cloud today and sign up for a free trial.\n\nData is an increasingly valuable commodity in today's digital world. Whether in finance, real estate, e-commerce or healthcare, the ability to extract, analyze and leverage data can provide a competitive edge for businesses across a wide range of industries. However, to fully harness the power of data, it is crucial to use a tool that can deliver reliability, precision and customizability.\n\nCustom web-scraping company Sequentum recently announced the launch of its cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution, Sequentum Cloud. The company says this cutting-edge platform is the ultimate web scraping tool, allowing users of all sizes to access high-quality, trusted, auditable, custom web data on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n\nWhy Low-Code Is Better Than No-Code\n\nWhen it comes to web scraping, many platforms aim to provide a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface that forgoes the need for traditional hand coding. So-called no-code tools may offer simplicity, but with the evolving nature of the internet, they lack the customizability required to handle ever-changing data extraction needs.\n\nSequentum Cloud is a low-code solution, aiming to strike the perfect balance between usability and customizability. Like no-code platforms, Sequentum offers a point-and-click interface for easy agent creation. The company says that around 95% of tasks can be achieved with reusable, composable assets, thereby saving time and allowing you to scale easily.\n\nHowever, for the remaining 5% of tasks, Sequentum Cloud supports custom coding in JavaScript, Python, C# and Regular Expression, giving you the flexibility to handle any data from any data source, in any data structure, to any destination.\n\nHarness The Sequentum Agent Human-Friendly Text Format To Build Trust And Train Your AI To Interact In Complex Ways With The Web\n\nOne of the advantages of Sequentum Cloud is its new and innovative nested, human-readable, text format of the agent you create. With all the data extraction process logic presented in this way, all stakeholders can understand the data and the extraction process, helping to promote trust and transparency in the process and the resulting data.\n\nFurthermore, non-technical staff will be able to review your data collection process by seeing all the steps laid out in a human-readable format and easily read every step that is being followed to obtain the data and ensure compliance with guidelines. For example, some companies might restrict their staff from using web scraping bots to automatically bypass CAPTCHA tests. With human-readable results, compliance teams can more easily verify that restricted activities such as CAPTCHA automation are not happening in their data collection.\n\nSimilarly, the human-friendly agent text format is a turnkey way to train AI to make use of websites and mobile apps no matter how complex the interaction needs to be.\n\nTrust, Transparency And Ethical Compliance\n\nData trustworthiness, transparency and regulatory compliance are of the utmost importance for companies. Sequentum Cloud aims to address this by ensuring that users can see exactly where their data originates from and every step of the collection process, all auditable with full documentation.\n\nSequentum argues that this not only mitigates legal risks, such as those relating to privacy and security, but also makes sure that data aligns with ethical standards. This is crucial when it comes to monetizing data assets since documenting full lineage on all data from how data is sourced and processed will not only enable dataset creators to demonstrate where they added value but will also point to the web sources that contributed to that value.\n\nThis is particularly important for AI, analytics and data-driven decision-making, as a lack of data transparency could mean risking future monetization opportunities or compliance failures as new regulations are adopted. By being proactive and applying transparent data practices today, companies can avoid losing out on all the value they've added once the laws catch up to the way people are working today.\n\nGet Started Today\n\nIn today's competitive environment, trust, precision and transparency are essential if you want to gain an edge. In November, CIOReview named Sequentum as the Enterprise Data Delivery Platform of the Year for 2024. Sequentum Cloud seems poised to be the ultimate web scraper for the most precise and trusted data, combining a low-code platform and point-and-click interface with the power of customization and human-readable nested text format of the agent you create.\n\nSign up for a free trial today and experience the Sequentum Edge.\n\nFeatured photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash.\n\nThis post contains sponsored content.

His 261.2 passing yards per game represents his lowest average since 2019, while his 89.0 passer rating is his worst mark since 2014.\n\nCousins' subpar performance is especially worrisome after he signed a massive four-year, $180 million contract to join Atlanta as a free agent in March.\n\nDespite his turnover issues and the Falcons' inconsistent offense, Morris has remained steadfast in his approach to the top quarterback spot on the depth chart.\n\nHe confirmed that Cousins would remain Atlanta's starter following a 42-21 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday.\n\nDianna Russini of The Athletic also reported that the Falcons haven't held any \"internal discussions\" regarding a change at quarterback.\n\nEven though Cousins is expected to retain his status as the starter, Morris also expressed his support for Penix as the team's eventual top signal-caller.\n\n\"I told you right from the beginning, he's our future,\" Morris said on Thursday, per Raimondi.\n\nPenix, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft, still appears to have the support of the coaching staff as a long-term option."

            "article_content": "Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 MSRP $279.99 Score Details \u201cCanon's MegaTank Pixma G4280 is an affordable inkjet tank with economical ink, but there are some trade-offs at that price.\u201d Pros Low price for an inkjet tank\n\nIncludes 2 years of ink\n\nInk costs are super low\n\nSetup was quick and easy Cons Slow scanning and printing\n\nLow-contrast plain paper photos\n\nDisplay is small\n\nTable of Contents Table of Contents Specs Design Printing performance Special features Software and compatibility Price Is the Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 worth it?\n\nCanon recently introduced the new MegaTank Pixma G4280 all-in-one, a low-cost inkjet tank printer that refills with bottles instead of cartridges. That means ink lasts much longer and costs significantly less.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nPrice isn\u2019t the only important consideration when you\u2019re shopping for the best printer. I went hands-on with the MegaTank Pixma G4280 to test print quality and speed, make copies, and scan photos to check out the automatic document feeder (ADF) and flatbed scanner.\n\nSpecs\n\nCanon MegaTank Pixma G4280 Dimensions 16.4 x 14.3 x 8.4 inches Weight 16.5 pounds Print speed 11 ppm (black), 6 ppm (color) Copy speed 8 cpm (black), 3.5 cpm (color) Print resolution 4800 x 1200 dpi Scan resolution 600 x 1200 dpi Ports Hi-Speed USB Paper capacity 100 sheets Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, dual band\n\nDesign\n\nThe MegaTank Pixma G4280 is very compact for an all-in-one printer with an ADF. The footprint is 16.4 inches by 14.3 inches and it stands just 8.4 inches high. The weight is 16.5 pounds, so it\u2019s easy to unbox and move around.\n\nThe lightly textured body in off-white works well in a home office and every corner is rounded, softening the appearance. It\u2019s a tank printer, so the ink levels are visible at a glance. The black tank is on the left side of the printer, with cyan, magenta, and yellow on the right.\n\nThe adjustable central control panel tilts up 45 degrees for easy viewing while standing or seated. Canon gave the MegaTank Pixma G4280 a 2.7-inch color touchscreen for easy access to menus. The controls also include buttons to make monochrome or color copies with one touch.\n\nThe main paper tray is in the back and holds 100 sheets. The ADF can handles 35 pages at a time. Overall, it\u2019s a nice design, but paper capacity could be larger.\n\nPrinting performance\n\nThe Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 is fast for short documents, completing the first page in about seven seconds. Inkjet printers don\u2019t have to warm up before starting, so they can beat laser printers in a sprint.\n\nFor longer print jobs, I felt the slowdown. Monochrome prints have a maximum speed of 11 pages per minute (ppm) and color manages just 6 ppm.\n\nA faster inkjet tank like Epson\u2019s EcoTank ET-3850 (16 ppm) or EcoTank Pro ET-5850 (25 ppm) cost more upfront, but offer economical printing without having to wait as long for the prints and copies.\n\nThat said, color and black-and-white documents look professional, and the MegaTank Pixma G4280 supports borderless printing. Fine lines and small print are sharp and easy to read.\n\nPhoto quality is good on glossy paper, but contrast is a little low. That problem is more obvious on plain paper where blacks look gray.\n\nWith tinkering, it\u2019s possible to improve picture quality. For example, selecting Photo Matte as the paper type improves plain paper photo quality.\n\nThere are better photo printers out there, and some are quite affordable.\n\nSpecial features\n\nThere\u2019s an option for duplex in copy settings, but the printer has what Canon calls semi-auto, which means I had to manually reinsert each sheet to complete the scan. It works, but takes time.\n\nIf you need to copy double-sided documents often, Canon\u2019s Maxify GX2020 costs more, but the full-duplex capability will save you a huge amount of time.\n\nThe copy quality is good and relatively fast for a slow printer. There are options to reduce, enlarge, and copy multiple pages to a single sheet, saving paper costs.\n\nThe flatbed scanner captures up to 600 dots per inch (dpi), which is good enough in most cases. For photos and negatives, you might want a dedicated scanner to maintain maximum resolution.\n\nSoftware and compatibility\n\nInstalling the MegaTank Pixma G4280 took about 15 minutes and was quite simple. I plugged in power, scanned the QR code on the printer\u2019s screen to get the app, and pressed the link button to connect Wi-Fi. There\u2019s a USB-B port if you prefer to use a wired connection to a computer.\n\nCanon ships the MegaTank Pixma G4280 with four full ink bottles, including a large supply of cyan, magenta, and yellow, along with a double-sized container of black. The box also contained replaceable black and color printheads.\n\nEverything was clearly marked. I installed the printheads and filled the ink tanks in about two minutes. The printer alerted me that the initial ink priming takes about seven minutes, so I could be productive elsewhere instead of waiting for it to finish.\n\nLike most major brands, Canon printers are easy to connect to Windows PCs and Macs. The Canon Print app allows printing and scanning from mobile devices and Chromebooks.\n\nPrice\n\nCanon\u2019s list price for the MegaTank Pixma G4280 is $280, but the printer is often available for $230. The low upfront price might catch your eye, but the real value is in the ink, which Canon estimates is equal to about $1,000 worth of ink cartridges.\n\nThe included bottles hold enough ink to last up to two years, equivalent to 30 black (PG-260) and color (CL-261) cartridges. That\u2019s the type used in the Canon\u2019s budget-priced Pixma TR7020a inkjet printer.\n\nWith full tanks, the MegaTank Pixma G4280 can print up to 6,000 monochrome pages and 7,700 color pages. Based on current ink prices, that means each color document costs about five-tenths of a cent per page, while black ink costs drop to two-tenths of a cent per page.\n\nIs the Canon MegaTank Pixma G4280 worth it?\n\nCanon\u2019s MegaTank Pixma G4280 is inexpensive for an inkjet tank printer, but there are trade-offs to keep the cost that low. It\u2019s slower than cartridge-based inkjets and laser printers and has limited 100-sheet paper capacity. The semi-auto duplex ADF works, but is slow and requires your presence through the entire process.\n\nHowever, if you aren\u2019t in a hurry, the MegaTank Pixma G4280 minimizes ink costs. It handles color document copies and prints nicely. Glossy photo prints also look good.\n\nAll in all, though, there are better all-in-one printers with full-duplex ADFs, and you can save you money on specialty paper costs by choosing the best photo printers, which can print with good quality on plain paper.\n\nThat means Canon\u2019s MegaTank Pixma G4280 could work well in a home office where you aren\u2019t sharing the printer with co-workers, but it\u2019s compromises make it harder to recommend for its intended audience."

His visionary leadership continues to transform organizations and inspire the global AI community.\n\nPlease tell us your name and a little more about yourself.\n\nMy name is Himanshu Sinha, and I am a data scientist with over 15 years of experience in leveraging machine learning and AI to drive transformative change across industries. From fintech to healthcare and hospitality, I have had the privilege of developing and deploying innovative AI solutions that blend technical excellence with business strategy. My expertise spans a wide range of areas, including generative AI, predictive analytics, and data observability.\n\nBeyond my technical work, I am a passionate mentor, a published co-author of books on AI and ML, and a patented innovator. I thrive on building solutions that not only solve complex problems but also inspire others to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.\n\nYou\u2019ve had an extraordinary career in AI and machine learning, spanning various industries like healthcare, hospitality, and fintech. Can you walk us through your journey and how it has shaped your current role as Director of Advanced Data Science at Marriott International?\n\nI began my professional journey in consumer-focused research for a CPG brand, here I developed a fascination for consumer behaviour change indicated through and their business implications . This passion deepened as I worked on leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to analyze behavioral changes and their impact on business outcomes. My focus has always been on helping organizations use patterns in data to inform strategy and drive results.\n\nWorking in large scale consulting such as Wipro brought me close to enterprises\u2019s pain areas and help create machine learning cored solutions for them. In 2012, I established a Center of Excellence for analytics at Agilis, a lesser-known company at the time, helping telecom clients predict fraud and mitigate risks like churn. Over the years, Agilis went through multiple acquisitions, becoming Infogix and later Precisely Inc. During this period, I led the development of a bespoke software product with an embedded ML-based \u2018Anomaly Detection\u2019 system. This solution predicts \u2018data drift and shift\u2019, ensuring data quality and integrity. Today, it\u2019s a multimillion-dollar offering used by Fortune 100 companies to maintain operational excellence of data dependent functions.\n\nCurrently, as the Director of Advanced Data Science at Marriott International, I lead transformative AI initiatives, including personalization models, generative AI applications, and global acquisition strategies. My journey has been about building scalable AI solutions that align technical innovation with business impact, and I continue to be inspired by the limitless potential of machine learning and AI to transform industries.\n\nIn your article, \u201cThe Ultimate Blueprint for Enterprise Chatbots: Simplify, Scale, Succeed\u201d, you discuss the challenges of fragmented chatbot strategies. What inspired you to advocate for a unified chatbot framework, and how do you see it transforming industries?\n\nThe inspiration came from witnessing the inefficiencies and frustrations caused by fragmented chatbot strategies in enterprises\u2014siloed implementations, inconsistent user experiences, and high maintenance costs. I realized the need for a unified framework that could streamline development, ensure scalability, and provide a seamless experience across touchpoints.\n\nA unified chatbot framework transforms industries by enabling businesses to deliver consistent, personalized interactions while reducing operational overhead. It empowers enterprises to integrate.\n\nEnterprises often face the dilemma of balancing ROI with the complexity of AI solutions. How do you approach this challenge in your projects, and can you share a specific example where you had to make such decisions?\n\nBalancing ROI with AI complexity is a common challenge, but I approach it by focusing on simplification and scalability without compromising value. In my article, The Ultimate Blueprint for Enterprise Chatbots: Simplify, Scale, Succeed, I discussed how fragmented chatbot strategies often create inefficiencies and diminish user satisfaction. To address this, I advocate for a unified framework that prioritizes intent-driven design and reusable components.\n\nA specific example is a chatbot project for a travel enterprise. Initially, individual bots were handling separate use cases like booking management, trip planning, and customer support, leading to redundancy and confusion. By implementing a unified triage bot as the primary entry point, we streamlined user interactions and routed intents to specialized APIs. This reduced operational complexity and boosted ROI by consolidating efforts into a cohesive system.\n\nThe result? Enhanced user satisfaction and scalable deployment across multiple business units\u2014all while maintaining a strong ROI through reduced maintenance costs and improved efficiency. Simplifying complexity is not just about technology\u2014it\u2019s about creating value for both users and businesses.\n\nYour work highlights generative AI\u2019s role in creating personalized user experiences, such as credit card recommendations. How do you envision the future of generative AI in personalization across industries?\n\nGenerative AI is revolutionizing personalization by creating tailored, intuitive experiences that resonate with individual users. In the context of chatbots, like those for credit card recommendations, generative AI plays a pivotal role in breaking decision paralysis. It simplifies complex choices by presenting relevant options in a conversational and engaging way, helping customers make faster and more confident decisions.\n\nLooking ahead, I envision generative AI expanding its influence across industries\u2014from retail to healthcare\u2014where it will not only personalize user interactions but also anticipate needs, provide proactive solutions, and streamline decision-making. The future of personalization lies in AI\u2019s ability to combine deep contextual understanding with dynamic adaptability, ultimately creating experiences that are both efficient and deeply human-centered.\n\nYou\u2019ve authored books, published scholarly articles, and filed patents in advanced AI domains. How do you balance your role as a technical leader and a thought leader in the ever-evolving field of AI?\n\nBalancing my roles as a technical and thought leader in AI comes down to a shared foundation: curiosity , giving back to learners community and a commitment to impact. As a technical leader, I focus on driving practical innovations\u2014building systems like scalable enterprise chatbots or anomaly detection frameworks that solve real business problems. This hands-on work keeps me connected to the evolving challenges and opportunities in AI.\n\nAs a thought leader, I view my role as amplifying these learnings for a broader audience. Writing articles on social blogs like \u201cThe Ultimate Blueprint for Enterprise Chatbots\u201d allows me to distill complex ideas into actionable strategies, fostering industry-wide collaboration and growth. It\u2019s a synergy\u2014my technical work feeds my thought leadership, while my engagement with the AI community sharpens my ability to lead in dynamic environments.\n\nUltimately, the key is staying grounded in purpose: using AI not just to innovate, but to inspire and drive meaningful change.\n\nMany of your projects aim to enhance customer experience through AI, like anomaly detection and marketing optimization. How do you align technical innovation with customer-centric outcomes?\n\nI believe the key to aligning technical innovation with customer-centric outcomes is to start with the end in mind\u2014understanding what the customer truly values. Whether it\u2019s anomaly detection, marketing optimization, or enterprise chatbots, my approach combines cutting-edge AI techniques with a deep focus on creating seamless and meaningful experiences for users.\n\nFor instance, in my article \u201cThe Ultimate Blueprint for Enterprise Chatbots: Simplify, Scale, Succeed,\u201d I emphasized building unified frameworks that deliver consistent, personalized customer interactions. Similarly, my work on marketing optimization involves leveraging predictive models to understand behavioral patterns, enabling hyper-targeted engagement that feels intuitive to the customer.\n\nAt the core, it\u2019s about using AI as a bridge\u2014not just to solve technical problems but to anticipate and enhance the customer journey. By embedding intelligence into every interaction, we not only drive business impact but also create solutions that resonate with people in real and tangible ways.\n\nWith increasing emphasis on data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA, how do you ensure that your AI models remain compliant while delivering actionable insights?\n\nEnsuring compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA starts with embedding guardrails into the design and deployment of AI models. Guardrails ensure that privacy, security, and transparency are foundational, not an afterthought.\n\nIn my work, I advocate for privacy-by-design principles\u2014data minimization, anonymization, and secure pipelines are non-negotiables. For instance, when building models for personalized customer targeting or chatbots, we ensure that data used is aggregated and anonymized, aligning with both regulations and user trust.\n\nBalancing compliance with actionable insights requires robust governance frameworks. These frameworks monitor data usage and provide explainability, ensuring that while insights drive business value, they do so ethically and legally. In the age of AI, it\u2019s not just about what we can do with data, but what we should do, and that\u2019s where compliance meets innovation.\n\nAs an internationally recognized expert, what advice would you give aspiring data scientists looking to make a significant impact in the field of AI and machine learning?\n\nMy advice to aspiring data scientists is simple: focus on solving practical problems and always prioritize the user experience. AI and machine learning aren\u2019t just about building sophisticated models\u2014they\u2019re about creating solutions that make a tangible difference.\n\nStart by immersing yourself in real-world challenges. Learn how businesses operate, identify pain points, and think about how data and AI can address them. For instance, in my own journey, I\u2019ve worked on everything from predictive analytics to creating a unified chatbot framework. These experiences taught me that the best solutions are the ones that simplify complexity and put the user first.\n\nStay curious, keep experimenting, and don\u2019t shy away from asking questions like: \u201cHow does this impact the end user?\u201d and \u201cIs this scalable for enterprise needs?\u201d A data scientist\u2019s true power lies not just in technical expertise but in the ability to translate it into meaningful impact. Keep that as your north star, and you\u2019ll create solutions that truly transform industries."

            "article_content": "[Provoked: How Washington Started the New Cold War with Russia and the Catastrophe in Ukraine, by Scott Horton, The Libertarian Institute, 2024; 690 pp.]\n\n\u201cA fox knows many things, but a hedgehog knows one big thing.\u201d Scott Horton is the liberty movement\u2019s foreign policy hedgehog, endeavoring to convince the American public of one essential truth: the folly of war. But within that sphere, Horton is a fox, weaving an encyclopedic knowledge of various conflicts into an elaborate and convincing tapestry that indicts elites, intellectuals, the military-industrial complex, and\u2014with characteristic vitriol\u2014neoconservatives in pushing the US toward unnecessary wars.\n\nProvoked: How Washington Started the New Cold War with Russia and the Catastrophe in Ukraine, fits this mold to a tee\u2014not because Horton contorts facts to a preconceived narrative. Rather, because it is often the same people pushing conflict after conflict who, unsurprisingly, resort to the same, well-worn playbook. Horton\u2019s tome is riveting, from beginning to end. Here, I will focus on the early post-Cold War years, since this part of the story is oft-neglected in contemporary debates about the origins of the Ukraine war.\n\nWith the closing of the Cold War, and the USSR dissolving, the US faced a crisis of success: what use is the NATO military alliance without the Soviet enemy to align against? More broadly, what grand strategy should the US adopt now that containing communism was obsolete? For neoconservatives, whose answer post-Cold War was benevolent global hegemony, the solution was to adapt NATO. NATO must gradually absorb more European nations, while leaving Russia out in the cold\u2014contained and encircled, in an even worse position than during the Cold War. NATO must expand its mission to keep European peace and expand Western democracy, or wither on the vine.\n\n\n\nFrom George H.W. Bush to today, the record meticulously compiled by Horton demonstrates that US and other Western leaders communicated to Russia leaders and officials that NATO would not expand east\u2014and could even allow for Russian membership in NATO. Various efforts like the Partnership for Peace and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were promoted to foster this impression that Russia would be included in European affairs, alliances, and institutions, rather than these structures aligning against them. All the while, these same US and Western leaders took virtually the opposite positions internally, with the result that the US willfully misled the Russians. The exact internal and external postures waxed and waned over the years, but this ultimate pattern held firm. This was even though, all along, Russian officials warned about how they and the Russian people would react to NATO advancing east. What we see is, in terms with which Americans are well-familiar, \u201ca long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object.\u201d\n\nIt began with George H.W. Bush, who promised Mikhail Gorbachev, after the fall of the Berlin Wall as the Soviet Union careened towards collapse, that the US would not take advantage of the situation. This was also reflected in a NATO resolution on June 7, 1991. Bush and his advisors promised that NATO would not expand if the Soviet Union would withdraw and allow German reunification. The 1990 settlement would only specify that the US would not put troops in East Germany, a nuance which Russia hawks have exploited to argue there was no promise not to expand NATO. But this does not fly. Horton asks the rhetorical question: what sense would it make for the Soviet Union to extract a promise not to put troops in East Germany, if the US had a free hand to bring the rest of Eastern Europe into a military alliance? This agreement only makes sense on a backdrop of agreeing not to expand NATO.\n\nThe sins of the Clinton years were legion. In the early 90s, the US sent economists from the Harvard Institute of International Development to Russia to enact what came to be called a \u201cshock therapy\u201d economic policy. It was so badly designed and had such poor outcomes that many Russian thought it must be deliberate. Unsurprisingly, this did not dispose ordinary Russians to view the West favorably. Throughout the decade, Clinton and his advisors duplicitously offered Russia promises that a \u201cPartnership for Peace\u201d process would be pursued rather than NATO expansion\u2014and that NATO would lose its military character\u2014all the while planning to expand NATO.\n\nThe Clinton administration was heavily involved in the Balkans wars of Bosnia and Kosovo, which present strong cases against \u201chumanitarian\u201d intervention. The result of Bosnia was that NATO proved itself capable of fulfilling a new mission, while the US solidified itself at the head of European affairs, each of which were necessary for subsequent NATO expansion. Kosovo further solidified NATO\u2019s new role on the continent\u2014even intervening in civil wars\u2014while the bombing campaign against Serbia convinced Russians that the US was an aggressive, ruthless great power, who would violate international rules when it suited them. The US engaged in this aggressive war, in violation of the UN Charter, without approval of the UN Security Council (on which Russia sat). So much for the liberal rules-based international order. The US\u2019s frequent remaking of the rules was a frequent complaint of Russia, including during the Iraq War.\n\nMoreover, when Russia went to war with break-away Chechnya, Clinton\u2019s CIA and US allies supported Chechen rebels and separatist mujahideen fighters fighting on Chechnya\u2019s side against the Russians, with the goal to disrupt an existing Russian oil pipeline running through Chechnya. This, too, Putin cited when invading Ukraine. (If this were all not bad enough, Horton shows how the Clinton administration supported the bin Ladenite terrorists in the Balkans wars and in Chechnya. Indeed, more than half of the September 11 hijackers were involved in these wars in the Balkans and Chechnya\u2014often both.)\n\nPutin\u2019s rise was itself a consequence of the Clintonian interventions in the 1990s: from the \u201cshock therapy\u201d economic policy, to helping Yeltsin get reelected in 1996, to Kosovo and Chechnya. As Horton points out, ironically, Putin invoked the Kosovo precedent of intervening in a civil war to \u201cprotect\u201d an ethnic minority to justify invading Ukraine. In one stunning example from the Kosovo war, Horton recounted how the Clinton administration ordered the bombing of a Serbian TV station. These actions still influence Putin\u2019s thoughts about the West today. Putin\u2019s strike on a TV tower in Kiev in February 2022 likely called back to that conflict.\n\nThe NATO-Russia Founding Act of May 1997 was another milestone in US duplicity toward Russia. It assured that NATO would not deploy nuclear weapons or \u201csubstantial\u201d troops to new NATO nations\u2019 territories. Importantly, the Clinton administration misled Russia into thinking the Founding Act would give Russia a genuine role in NATO deliberations\u2014although it would not have a say within the NATO alliance itself\u2014when, in the words of Clinton advisor Strobe Talbott, the US\u2019s view was that \u201call we\u2019re really promising them is monthly meetings.\u201d\n\nThroughout Clinton\u2019s term, the Clinton administration fed Russia the lie that claimed NATO\u2019s mission was becoming political, rather than military, so agreeing not to expand NATO would be admitting that NATO\u2019s mission was to contain Russia. He even said he would leave open the possibility of Russia entering NATO. But Horton shows they had no intention to do any of this. To make matters worse, in July 1997 NATO and Ukraine signed an agreement that would provide for training Ukraine\u2019s military and improve their interoperability with NATO, and in August 1997 planned a military exercise involving several former Warsaw Pact states and Soviet republics to simulate US military intervention in an ethnic conflict in Crimea.\n\nNo, this was not all. The US tried to cut out Russia from Caspian Basin oil by refusing to run a pipeline from Azerbaijan through Russia, pushing it to a Western route through Turkey instead. The US also backed the GUAM (Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova) grouping to \u201cspeed European integration and exclude Russia influence from the South Caucasus,\u201d according to Horton, which Russia strongly opposed, calling it an \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d in 2005. The Clinton administration also violated Bush and Gorbachev\u2019s Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe in 1999, incredulously claiming that the \u201cpermanent US military bases in Bulgaria and Romania\u201d were actually just temporary.\n\nThe close of the Clinton years began a wave of \u201ccolor revolutions\u201d in Russia\u2019s backyard. The key thing about these \u201crevolutions\u201d is that they are heavily funded and supported by foreign governments or NGOs, such as George Soros\u2019 groups. Rather than directly or covertly overthrow an existing regime, these organizations operate \u201cabove board,\u201d meaning they avoid specifically endorsing candidates\u2014since that would be illegal\u2014and instead fund and assist groups that promote more generic, non-partisan efforts like \u201cdemocracy.\u201d In context, of course, their activities are geared to \u201cbenefit . . . a favored candidate or party.\u201d A favorite tactic is using \u201cparallel vote tabulation\u201d or exit polls, which are used to dispute official election results. The dispute typically spills over into street demonstrations with the goal of ousting the ostensible victor.\n\nThe \u201crevolutions\u201d began in Serbia in 2000 with the ousting of Clinton\u2019s b\u00eate noire Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. As Horton sardonically comments, this culminated in the \u201csacking and burning of the [Serbian] parliament building in what would surely be called a violent insurrection by American Democrats if they had not been behind it.\u201d Numerous other states would be targeted for color revolutions by the US and its Soros-backed NGO allies over the next decades.\n\nIncredibly, this only begins to scratch the surface of these early, post-Cold War provocations toward Russia that Horton documents, let alone the follies and misdeeds that occurred during the George W. Bush presidency and thereafter. Horton has persuasively made the case that the US provoked Russia over the course of three decades, knowing that Russia would respond with hostility toward NATO expansion. Yet, with reckless abandon, US leaders and officials pushed on, achieving their wildest dreams of NATO expansion and setting their sights on what was always their crown jewel\u2014Ukraine. It did not have to be this way, and it still does not. But time is ticking. Defying expectations, President Biden manages to reach new heights of absurdity in his escalatory policy toward Russia, ticking off a box on Zelensky\u2019s deadly five-point \u201cpeace\u201d plan. The war cannot end soon enough.\n\nBecome a 2025 Member!"

            "article_content": "Monitor manufacturer AOC has revealed its latest 4K OLED gaming monitor. The new AOC AG326UD might not have the catchiest name, but it sports a decent set of specs with a $799 price tag.\n\nAOC takes up two spots on our best gaming monitor guide, thanks to their affordability and performance. The new AOC AGON Pro monitor appears to be following suit, as it undercuts some QD-OLED and regular OLED monitors by a fair margin in the 4K space.\n\nIn our tests, we\u2019ve found that Samsung\u2019s QD-OLED is generally superior to LG\u2019s competing WOLED tech, especially when it comes to viewing text on the Windows desktop, which can look fuzzier on the latter. AOC also says its new monitor supports TrueBlack HDR400, which will give games deep, rich blacks.\n\nThe monitor also looks set to carry on AOC\u2019s long line of excellent high-refresh rate monitors. While not the fastest, its 165Hz refresh rate is more than enough for most people and will be a massive boon for those deep in the waters of esports or twitch-heavy titles.\n\nThis lower refresh rate than the competition is probably a good reason why this monitor sits at $799 rather than over $1,000. Another bonus is that this new AOC screen is also Nvidia G-Sync compatible, meaning it can synchronize its refresh rate with the frame rate output from the best graphics card models, stopping irritating tearing issues.\n\nOLED tech \u2013 and its spin-offs \u2013 are currently going through a small price crash. On Amazon, large quantities of previously expensive 1440p and 1080p OLED gaming monitors are having hundreds of dollars slashed from their price tags.\n\nAOC\u2019s Agon Pro AG276QZD for, example, which has a 1440p resolution and 240Hz refresh rate, is sitting at a single cent under $500, for example, reduced from $600. Meanwhile, on the competing 4K front, the Asus ROG Swift PG32UCDM has had $300 cut from its price, leaving it at $999.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait for AOC\u2019s newest 4K QD-OLED to cross our desks before we make any real judgment. However, it is still cheaper than the best-known brands even with discounts. The AOC AG326UD also has a 32-inch screen, making it a little bigger than most OLED monitors in this price range.\n\nOLED looks like it is getting cheaper every year, and with CES 2025 coming, we\u2019re expecting to see much more. The sublime color reproduction and fast response times provided by these panels mean that any titles played on the best gaming PCs will almost always look infinitely better than on LCD. Even the best gaming handheld, the Steam Deck, has had an OLED refresh, putting it right at the top of our best gaming handheld guide."

If you want to write it out, it\u2019s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.\n\n\"This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a prediction first made by David Deutsch.\"\n\nApparently, all these wires help to draw information from parallel universes (Google)\n\nAdvert\n\nProfessor Deutsch is a physicist at the University of Oxford, and is known for his work in quantum computing after putting in research during the 1990s, supporting Neven's claims.\n\nSkeptics cast doubts\n\nHowever, some doubters say that these claims about its performance are based on the company's own benchmark to measure quantum performance, and that it doesn't prove that people in parallel universes are getting our information for us.\n\nThe development of Willow and the scientific findings behind it have been published in the journal, Nature."

            "article_content": "Drone sightings over Northern New Jersey have sparked feelings of confusion and fear from residents and local officials alike\u2014but some attention-seeking, alien-obsessed politicians in D.C. appear to be milking the fear cycle for all it\u2019s worth.\n\nIn a video rant posted to her X account Thursday, Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene insisted that the government\u2019s continued inability to identify the strange lights hovering over the Garden State was \u201ctotal bullshit\u201d that put every American \u201cin danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can track down a guy that just killed a CEO, but they can\u2019t identify what nightly drones are and where they\u2019re coming from,\u201d Greene continued, referring to Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\n\u201cSecondly, if they\u2019re telling the truth, then this country is in horrible shape. We\u2019re all in danger,\u201d Greene added. \u201cI mean, seriously, if our great government can\u2019t identify what these drones are\u2014they\u2019re flying every single night, the people are sitting out there videoing with their cell phones\u2014then no American is safe. And I have no respect if our government cannot say what these are.\u201d\n\nCommercial-grade drones were first spotted lingering over sections of Northern Jersey in mid-November, sparking an FBI investigation into the aerial gathering. At a Wednesday briefing between the office of New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and the Department of Homeland Security, mayors from the region lamented that no one from state or federal agencies had been able to tell them exactly how many drones were flying over the state, with estimates ranging from 400 to thousands, according to NBC News.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I can go back to my residents and say that I\u2019m satisfied from this meeting, when now I know that I have 180 drones that have been flying over the state of New Jersey,\u201d Middletown Mayor Tony Perry told NBC after the meeting. \u201cWe have no more information as to where these drones are coming from, where they\u2019re launching from, where they\u2019re landing.\u201d\n\nGreene, famously, loves a space-based conspiracy. In a 2018 Facebook post (two years before she took office), Greene linked alleged sightings of \u201clasers or blue beams of light\u201d to the cause of the California wildfires. She then, apropos of nothing, further tied those sightings to the Rothschilds, a wealthy Jewish banking family often targeted by antisemitic conspiracies, whom she believed were clearing the land for rail stations.\n\nBut she\u2019s not the only D.C. politico to thoughtlessly stoke the flames over the unusual drone sightings. New Jersey Representative Jeff Van Drew suggested to Fox News on Wednesday that the drones were coming from an Iranian \u201cmothership\u201d\u2014a claim that the Pentagon quickly shot down.\n\n\u201cThere is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there\u2019s no so-called \u2018mothership\u2019 launching drones towards the United States,\u201d Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said the same day."

[View Related Entries]\n\nAbout\n\n\"Project Blue Beam\" is a conspiracy theory proposed by Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois conspiracy theorist Serge Monast in the 1990s. It claims NASA and the UN plan to stage a fake alien invasion or religious event using holograms to establish a new world order. Its 2024 resurgence ties to increased public interest in UFOs and aliens, as seen in the 2023 UFO Whistleblower Report, the unidentified aircraft shot down in Alaska in 2023 and other UAP-related phenomena in 2024.\n\nOrigin\n\nCanadian Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois conspiracy theorist Serge Monast first coined and propagated his \"Project Blue Beam\" conspiracy theory in his 1994 book Project Blue Beam (NASA). The book detailed the belief that NASA, alongside the United Nations, plans to create a new global totalitarian regime by technologically simulating an extraterrestrial encounter. \"Project Blue Beam\" is a visual representation of what this messianic symbol could look like, i.e. a blue beam coming from the sky as though from a spaceship.\n\nSpread\n\nIn the 2010s, the phrase \"Project Blue Beam\" came to be used as a buzzword to peddle similar conspiracy theories about governments faking a space invasion to consolidate global power.\n\nSeveral YouTube videos addressing the conspiracy theory cited Serge Monast directly, as seen in a November 7th, 2007 YouTube video by REQUIEMETERNAM, captioned, \"ILLUMINATI The Blue Beam Project Top Secret 1.\" The video gathered over 300,000 views in 17 years.\n\nOn April 14th, 2009, YouTuber AutoActionCam posted a similar video, detailing several NASA and military-related press conferences and releases from U.S. officials, piecing together a theory that implies that these institutions plan to come together and create a rapture hoax.\n\nA February 26th, 2013, Reddit post to the subreddit /r/todayilearned by Redditor /u/doc_daneeka alleged that the CIA once proposed a solution to remove Fidel Castro from power in Cuba by spreading \"rumours that he was the Antichrist, then fake the second coming; a US submarine would project an image of Jesus on some clouds near Havana while firing star-shells. A loudspeaker would be the voice of Jesus, urging them to renounce communism.\" The post gathered over 2,000 points in 10 years.\n\nThe linked article cited a November 20, 1975, document titled \"Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders,\" written by former CIA Assistant Deputy Director for National Intelligence Programs, Thomas A. Parrott. The document reportedly recounted how Major General Edward Geary Lansdale proposed the aforementioned Castro scheme.\n\n2020s Project Blue Beam Resurgence\n\nOn November 8th, 2022, Robert Duncan discussed Project Blue Beam on Danny Brown's podcast. The relevant clip was reposted to Twitter / X by @TheChiefNerd on February 13th, 2023, gathering over 6,000 likes in a year. The post came soon after the military shot down an unknown cylindrical object over Alaska, prompting UFO discussions nationwide.\n\nHarvard Scientist Robert Duncan Explains \u2018Project Blue Beam\u2019 \u201cYou can see it by the naked eye and it would leave a radar trace\u201d@KONCRETE pic.twitter.com/Vi4r1zuhcc \u2014 Chief Nerd (@TheChiefNerd) February 14, 2023\n\nOn March 10th, 2024, MMA fighter Ryan Garcia mentioned the conspiracy theory in a TikTok live that was reposted to X by @ramberrto, gathering over 5,000 likes in nine months.\n\nRyan Garcia also known as KingRyan just went live on TikTok while hooked up onto a machine.

The first short videos, on topics such as nuclear science-based solutions to drought, cancer and plastic pollution, will be released in January across EMEA, both on television and online.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said: \u201cWe are excited to work with the Discovery Channel to help even more people learn about the amazing world of nuclear science. From the IAEA\u2019s unique laboratories, our scientists are using radiation to recycle plastics and create plants that can better withstand climate change, they\u2019re researching new targeted forms of cancer therapy, and much more. In the last couple of years alone, the IAEA sent seeds into space to see if we can develop even stronger variants; we sent scientists to Antarctica to collect accurate data about plastic pollution and we helped conservationists use radiotracers to combat rhino poaching!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are so many fascinating stories to tell about the cutting-edge nuclear techniques through which the IAEA assists countries in the fight against hunger, disease, climate change and energy poverty, to name just a few, and we are very happy to be telling them together with the Discovery Channel.\u201d\n\nIAEA Director of Communications Sophie Boutaud de la Combe added: \u201cWe are very proud of the films we make at the IAEA, where we have built a dedicated video team with award winning cinematographers and are delighted that the Discovery Channel will use our original footage to reach an even bigger audience. Accurate and engaging story-telling can do a lot to explain the benefits of nuclear science and technology in our daily lives.\u201d\n\nWatch original IAEA films on the IAEA YouTube channel here."
