            "article_content": "A lot of AI tools promise something like magic. Just write down all the stuff you need to do, or better yet, just let the tool record every second of your life, and presto manifesto, it\u2019ll do\u2026 something. Buy plane tickets, maybe, or magically reorder your calendar to maximize your flow state. The idea is huge and enticing, that you could just live your life and your AI assistant will make everything happen on your behalf. But hardly any of it works.\n\nThe developers of the app Twos are taking a much more cautious and, as a result, much more actually useful approach. Twos is an app for taking notes, managing to-dos, and generally making lists of any and every kind \u2014 Parker Klein, the app\u2019s creator, just calls it \u201ca place to write things down.\u201d Klein has been working on the app for nearly a decade, first as a tool just for himself and most recently as a true startup. I\u2019ve been using Twos off and on for a couple of years, and there\u2019s a lot to like about the app.\n\nThe Twos AI approach, which Klein and cofounder Joe Steilberg call \u201csmart suggestions,\u201d is to use AI to help you simply take the first step in getting something done. If you write down the name of a movie, Twos might offer you a link to a JustWatch search or the IMDb page for that movie. If you write a person\u2019s name and phone number, it can add them to your contacts with one tap. If you\u2019re making a grocery list, it\u2019ll send you to Amazon or Walmart or Instacart to buy it.\n\nThe logic behind all these suggestions is really simple: Twos looks for certain words and phrases to determine what you\u2019re trying to do and which integration makes the most sense. (You can pick and choose, too \u2014 I never use Uber Eats, for instance, so I turned that off entirely.) All the smart suggestions really do is take the first step. They\u2019re definitely not perfect \u2014 when I type \u201cbake blueberry muffins,\u201d it offers me an Allrecipes link, which is helpful and relevant, and a Google Maps search for \u201cblueberry muffins around me,\u201d which is not. But even in the feature\u2019s early days, I\u2019ve found it way more useful than almost every other, vastly more ambitious productivity tool.\n\nLike any to-do list app worth its valuation, Twos now has an AI chatbot. Image: Twos\n\nTwos also has a built-in chatbot, which you can use to ask questions about your notes. If you use your note-taking app like a journal, this can be really cool \u2014 \u201cwhat was the name of that Thai food place we went to a few weeks ago?\u201d is a surprisingly common question in my life. Lots of apps have something like this, and they all suffer from the same problem: if you don\u2019t put everything in the app, the search isn\u2019t that useful. But whether it\u2019s Notion or Dropbox or Twos, the AI integrations reward the heaviest users.\n\nAI turns Twos into not just my to-do list but the jumping-off point for all my tasks. Since the app works across platforms \u2014 it\u2019s fundamentally a web app, but there are versions for Android and iOS, Windows and Mac, and more \u2014 it\u2019s easy to just dump information into. Then, when it\u2019s time to leave for the restaurant I wrote down and promptly forgot the name of, I open Twos, tap the sparkles that appear next to any item with a smart suggestion, and it opens Google Maps and directs me there. You can store and organize things inside of Twos, but I find myself using it transiently, just for the small things in day-to-day life. I need to make bread: click the sparkles, bread recipes appear. Remember to buy those Sesame Street bath toys for the kid: click the sparkles, Amazon search done. Ollie\u2019s birthday is December 7th: click the sparkles, in my contacts.\n\nFor now, the Twos smart suggestions are only available in beta testing, and there\u2019s a waitlist for new users. (Though Klein did tell me that if you sign up and use the code \u201cVerge,\u201d you\u2019ll be able to skip the line.) Klein and Steilberg are working on more integrations and more ways to do even more with just a few words of your writing. They\u2019re obviously enticed by how far this might go. Why not automatically buy the toys or start the grocery delivery and take a cut for themselves? It\u2019s an age-old idea, that one. Any.do tried it years ago; there was even a frenzy of apps like Magic that would do it all via text message. Even the Alexa business model used to depend on you being willing to just shout \u201cbuy toilet paper\u201d at your speaker and trust it to do the rest.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with the idea: it doesn\u2019t work. There are too many logistical questions, too many ways to screw it up, and too many consequences for getting it wrong that it\u2019s not going to work anytime soon. If ever."

So if you have an Android phone and have been wanting to make some music with Suno away from your computer, you now have the freedom to do so.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with Suno AI, the company behind the app describes it as an AI music studio. Similar to how other generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, work, it\u2019s able to generate a result based on whatever prompt you submit. In this case, it can turn text into up to four-minute full songs.\n\nSuno AI isn\u2019t the only AI music generator out there, but it sets itself apart by being able to create everything from the instrumentals to the vocals and lyrics. In the clip below, you can hear an example of a song Rolling Stone made using the AI.\n\nRolling Stone \u00b7 Soul Of The Machine The AI-powered app first made waves back in December 2023 when it partnered with Microsoft to create a plugin for Copilot. Its ability to generate music that sounds as if it were created by a human artist helped jettison its popularity. Now, if you go into the Google Play Store and search for Suno AI, you\u2019ll find a listing for the app.\n\nIn addition to having the ability to create your own songs, you\u2019ll be able to browse creations from other users. You can also curate your songs and follow other creators.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints about the app is the audio quality. However, Suno recently released an update that fixed this issue and introduced a new ReMi (pronounced \u201cray me\u201d) lyric writer that can produce edgier lyrics.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

You can quickly share images and videos with a QR code rather than requiring the person to be a contact or fiddling with your app's sharing settings.\n\nOne of the most notable Gemini enhancements is \u201cSaved info with Gemini,\u201d which lets you tell Gemini to remember certain things about yourself so that it can generate better results tailored for you. As an example, if you're vegan and you ask it to find recipes, Gemini can remember that you're vegan and will only provide vegan recipes without you ever having to specify that detail in your query.\n\n\u201cSaved info with Gemini\u201d is rolling out to Gemini on all Android phones and the web.\n\nPixel Phone Updates\n\nMany other new features being announced today will specifically roll out to Google's Pixel phones, though some of these may make their way to the broader Android ecosystem down the road.\n\nSome core Pixel phone features are getting quality-of-life updates. Call screen, which is Google's system that screens phone calls to obliterate robocalls and telemarketers from your life, now offers suggested replies you can tap through when a call is being screened. So if a delivery driver is calling and you're in a meeting, you can respond through a series of taps on the screen instead of picking up. You can also look at the real-time conversation between Google's screening agent and the caller, and take over at any time. This latter feature is available on Pixel 6 and newer, but the suggested replies are exclusive to the Pixel 9 series.\n\nCourtesy of Julian Chokkattu/Google\n\nGoogle's Recorder app, which transcribes recordings in real time, now has a \u201cClear Voice\u201d feature you can toggle on to cut out distracting noises from the audio, like the typing of a keyboard or blaring horns on the street if you were in a noisy environment when you recorded the conversation. Cleaning up audio has been a bit of a theme for Google as it uses similar technology called \u201cClear Calling\u201d in its Pixel Buds Pro 2 wireless earbuds and Pixel phones to reduce background sounds, not to mention the Audio Magic Eraser, which lets you erase unwanted sounds in recorded videos.\n\nNow Playing, one of the original features that debuted on the second Pixel phone, lets you see right on the lock screen what music is playing in your surroundings so you don't have to look anything up. This feature now can recognize even more songs and artists, and when you go to your Now Playing history in the settings menu, it'll show album art."

            "article_content": "Google searches might soon be a lot more conversational on Android devices thanks to artificial intelligence, judging from unreleased code discovered by 9to5 Google. The Search app may soon add an AI Mode combining interactive discussions and other features that make Google's foundational service act more than a little like the Gemini AI assistant.\n\nAI Mode, referred to as AIM in the uncovered code, melds the human-like interactions of Gemini Live with Google Search and tosses in the visual understanding and analysis that you get from Google Lens. When in AIM, you'll be able to respond to what Google Search comes up with. Instead of just a list of results, you'll be able to ask follow-up questions, interrupt responses, and otherwise treat Search like it's Gemini Live.\n\nAI Mode should be available as a tab in the Google app's bottom navigation bar if and when it rolls out. In addition to using your voice to search, you can also use photos taken with your phone or other uploaded ones. You can then explain what you want to search for concerning the image. One additional amusing bit of the code is that its placeholder is a winking emoticon.\n\nGemini or Search?\n\nThe idea of AI Mode in Google Search makes sense at first glance but raises a few questions in context. It appears to be so similar to Gemini that it is more of a variation of Gemini Live. That would fit with how Google seems keen to get people to use Gemini for everything. AI Mode isn't identical to Gemini Live, as AI Mode would offer a multimodal experience that combines text, voice, and images, but it's close enough to make it hard to know when you would use one over the other.\n\nAI Mode might just be a road to a more comprehensive service. Augmenting Google Search with Lens's ability to ask questions about photos and videos and boosting the current voice interaction, which transcribes spoken requests, could pave the way for Google Search to become a facet of Gemini or vice versa. It could also change how we think about the most popular search engine in the world.\n\nInstead of turning to Google to say \u201cshow me results,\u201d we could simply ask it to \u201cgive me a direct, thoughtful answer.\u201d\n\nYou might also like"

The house, a 3,100 square foot farmhouse and eight-acre property, was made famous by the movie series that began in 2013. Boston Globe/Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nThe subject of the box office hit \"The Conjuring,\" a house in Harrisville, R.I. (a village in the town of Burrillville) that came to be known as \"The Conjuring House\" has been ordered to close. Known for its alleged paranormal happenings, the house drew in paranormal investigators and fans who sought to stay over at the \"haunted\" attraction.\n\nOn Nov. 18, the renewal of the house's annual entertainment license was declined via a vote by the Burrillville Town Council, with Town Manager Michael C. Wood pointing out issues with insurance, police and the fire marshal as reasons why the renewal of the house's license should be declined.\n\n\"Quite frankly, there's too many problems on the site,\" Wood said in a video of the Nov. 18 meeting. \"It's unfortunate because it was a great business for the town in the past.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nDuring the meeting, it was determined by the Town Council that the house's entertainment license would cease at the end of November.\n\nIssues became prevalent a few weeks earlier when the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training issued a stop work order after it was discovered that the business had been operating without workers' compensation insurance coverage since May 2024, according to the Providence Journal. The stop work order was lifted in mid-November when the necessary insurance was obtained.\n\nBoston Globe reporter Amanda Milkovits and her sister Susanne Carpenter, and colleague John Huntington, Paranormal Investigator in the house's \"dairy room\" in the cellar at the \"Conjuring\" house in Harrisville, RI on Oct. 14, 2020.

Nun\u0303ez's charge will be addressed at a pretrial conference on Dec. 17, according to the Providence Journal.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nNun\u0303ez purchased the house in 2022 for $1.5 million \u2014 a 3,000 square-foot property located on eight acres of land that boasts three bedrooms and two bathrooms. The house is open to the public for house tours and investigations for paranormal researchers. \"The Conjuring House\" also offers overnight stays and a \"GHamping experience\" which allows guests to camp outside while exploring the house at night.\n\nIn the 1970's, paranormal researchers Ed and Lorraine Warren made multiple visits to the small house in Harrisville to investigate what was believed to be a \"haunting.\" The couple traveled from Connecticut to investigate reports of levitating furniture and smells of rotting flesh, according to the New England Society of for Psychic Research (NESPR), an organization founded by the Warrens.\n\nThe events surrounding the Warrens' investigation into the house were cemented in film history with the 2013 movie \"The Conjuring.\" The popularity of the movie led to the \"Conjuring Universe\" of movies, which have collectively grossed more than $2 billion globally at the box office.\n\nTony Spera, co-director of NESPR and the son-in-law of the Warrens, said that he believes there is still much left to uncover behind the \"haunting\" of the \"Conjuring\" house.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\"Annabelle\" doll in the house's living room at the \"Conjuring\" house in Harrisville, RI on Oct. 14, 2020.

However, new tours are not being booked. Nu\u00f1ez said she will attempt to get the business license back, but if that fails, she will not sell the house.\n\n\"There are people that want me to sell. I\u2019m never selling,\" Nu\u00f1ez told WPRI. \"If I don\u2019t run a business, I still have a great house.\"\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nAccording to the Burrillville town ordinances, an entertainment license can be revoked \"for violation of any requirement of this article.\" The punishment for violations to the town ordinances, according to Sec. 1-6 of the ordinances, can include a fine of up to $500, up to 30 days of imprisonment, pay a restitution of up to $2,500 or 10 days of community service."

            "article_content": "I love a good show about teenagers fighting supernatural entities while also facing the mortifying ordeal of being a high school student. So Netflix\u2019s Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld, which not only sees a superpowered teenage girl battle demons but also draws from Chinese mythology, seems like it was created in a lab just for me. From the first trailer, I had high expectations. With bright, bold colors and character designs, compelling character relationships, and some very funky monsters and action sequences, it really checked all my boxes.\n\nBut there\u2019s one specific scene that I can\u2019t stop thinking about, because it so perfectly exemplifies the tone of this show and why it works so well.\n\n[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld.]\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nJentry Chau vs. the Underworld kicks off when 16-year-old Jentry (Ali Wong) learns that a demon is after her for the powers she\u2019s suppressed for most of her life. She must return to her hometown in Texas with her great-aunt Gugu (Lori Tan Chinn) in order to close a portal to the underworld and prevent more monsters from wreaking havoc in the world. All the while, she tries to fit in with her new (old?) classmates and slowly learns more about her own past and Gugu\u2019s refusal to reveal more about her parents.\n\nAbout halfway through the show, Jentry discovers that Kit (Woosung Kim), the new boy at school with big, dreamy eyes, is actually a Painted Skin demon from Chinese mythology. This means that he\u2019s actually a long-limbed shadowy demon who must construct elaborate disguises out of human skin to conceal his true form. Jentry is initially hurt by this revelation, but she eventually seeks his help to create a skin form in her image for a heist.\n\nCue a montage where the two of them carefully sew together a Jentry skin in Kit\u2019s dimly lit workshop while a soft romantic song plays. Kit cuts into a roll of flesh so that it best replicates Jentry\u2019s body, and gently tilts her face up so he can measure her chin. Jentry is mildly disgusted when Kit rifles through a bin of body parts and asks him to warn her when he picks the eyes, to which he replies he already knows the exact match for her eyes, because he\u2019s imagined them so often \u2014 and Jentry blushes.\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nIt\u2019s a bit gross. It\u2019s incredibly intimate. It\u2019s uncanny, yet super romantic. It\u2019s adorably reminiscent of a budding high school romance, and also like something out of The Silence of the Lambs. But it\u2019s emblematic of how showrunner Echo Wu has marvelously leaned into the wonderfully weird, both with the paranormal elements and the more grounded stakes.\n\nThe show leans pretty hard on the more terrifying aspects of Chinese mythology, like a trip to Diyu, the Daoist version of hell, where souls are tortured for eons. The bright colors and cartoonish character designs keep the show firmly planted in PG territory, but it does get a bit freaky, in a good way. At one point, for instance, the house ghosts need to generate some more ectoplasm, so one of them volunteers to be brutally maimed \u2014 off screen, but with some screaming \u2014 in order to generate just a splash of magical ghost fluid. And even with those darker elements, the tone never gets too dire, and a lot of the fun comes from the weird situations and paranormal entities that Jentry and her friends encounter.\n\nAnd because Wu is tapping into a cultural mythos that American animation hasn\u2019t fully explored, none of the supernatural plotlines feel overdone (do we really need another broody vampire when we can have a Painted Skin demon?). American cartoons have long flirted with Chinese mythology, without actually delivering. American Dragon: Jake Long and The Life and Times of Juniper Lee, two animated shows that aired in the mid-2000s, also featured a young Chinese American protagonist guided by an elderly relative to battle monsters \u2014 but both shows primarily prioritized Western mythology, only incidentally pulling in Chinese legends. Jentry Chau does the reverse: By default, everything Jentry encounters is from Chinese mythology, mixing in other cultural perspectives without assuming that the default is Western. It\u2019s a unique lens, and one that really lets the show shine and avoid any trite cliches.\n\nJentry Chau vs the Underworld. Ali Wong as Jentry in Jentry Chau vs the Underworld. Cr. COURTESY OF NETFLIX \u00a9 2024 Image: Netflix\n\nBut even with the fun paranormal side, Wu never loses sight of the show\u2019s more realistic threads. At the end of the day, Jentry is a teenage girl who just wants to be normal. Her relationships with her friends, her secretive great-aunt, and her own self might be colored by the paranormal, but they all feel very rooted in realism. The scene with Kit works so well because even though it\u2019s a demon making a skin costume, it\u2019s also about teenage crushes and complicated feelings (and the fact that those complicated feelings stem from your crush actually being a demonic creature). Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld certainly isn\u2019t the only high school supernatural romp out there, but Wu takes care to balance the fantastical elements with the real ones.\n\nStill, the show works so well because Wu isn\u2019t afraid to get weird. As both a coming-of-age story and a supernatural show, Jentry Chau could easily fall into some cliched genre pitfalls. But Wu doesn\u2019t let that happen, simply by embracing the funkier beats and really letting them sing. It\u2019s in the little details in the background, like Jentry\u2019s Lisa Frank leopard poster and Gugu\u2019s crocs. And it\u2019s also in the bigger scenes, like that romantic moment between Jentry and Kit, set against the sewing of a flesh suit. Now that\u2019s something special \u2014 and the whole show is a special, weird gem that sparkles with neon intensity.\n\nJentry Chau vs. the Underworld is available to stream on Netflix now."

Then combine warm water and dry ice. That will turn the solid ice into a gas. Pour the gas into the tank. The bubbles will float, and a cloud will form above a layer of clear gas.\n\nWhat It Teaches: This experiment teaches kids about phase changes, combustion reactions, and gas laws.\n\nDiscovery Lab Director of Education, Chip Lindsey said, \"You get iridescent rainbows on the bubbles, so what causes that? You see that the bubbles begin to float down through the carbon dioxide, what causes that? All of those questions are like an entry point to really talk about basic properties of physics, chemistry, and even biology.\"\n\nHow Can I Learn More?\n\nThe Discovery Lab will be doing these fire and ice experiments and activities daily in its Science Lab.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nA 1 sites of MenB PS I. Credit: Science Advances (2024). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adp4937\n\nA team of researchers has revealed the structure of a modified and evolved version of Photosystem I (PS I), a key protein complex used by plants and cyanobacteria to convert sunlight into chemical energy. This discovery sheds light on the evolution and adaptation of photosynthetic organisms and could potentially lead to new, highly efficient systems for producing renewable solar fuels.\n\nThe research was led by K.V. Lakshmi at RPI's Baruch '60 Center for Biochemical Solar Energy Research. The center, established by Johanna and Tom Baruch, RPI Class of 1960 and Trustee Emeritus, is focused on understanding and enhancing the rates of photosynthetic processes, such as light harvesting, electron transport, and increasing the yield of products under changing environmental conditions.\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process that powers life on Earth by allowing plants and certain bacteria to harness sunlight and produce chemical energy. One crucial part of this process is the photosynthetic protein PS I, which helps turn light into usable chemical energy.\n\nBy examining the structure and function of PS I in unprecedented detail, scientists can understand the adaptation of photosynthetic processes under changing environmental conditions and learn to harness them for human-made artificial solar energy systems that could produce renewable fuels, such as hydrogen, a clean energy source.\n\nIn a new breakthrough study published in the journal Science Advances, the researchers focused on a modified version of PS I isolated from a cyanobacterium (a.k.a., blue-green algae). Although natural PS I contains a molecule called phylloquinone to transfer electrons, evolution and adaptation led to a variant with an alternate molecule called DMPBQ.\n\nSwapping the phylloquinone molecule is a major discovery, as it can help scientists understand how organisms can adapt their photosynthetic machinery to varying environmental conditions. This discovery suggests that the electron carrier can be swapped with other molecules that could allow PS I to be connected to catalysts that generate hydrogen, effectively turning the protein into a tiny solar-powered fuel factory.\n\nThe electron transfer chain cofactors of PS I from WT Synechocystis 6803 and the MenB deletion variant. Credit: Science Advances (2024). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adp4937\n\nThe study used a cutting-edge technique known as cryogenic electron microscopy to capture a highly detailed picture of the modified PS I. With a resolution of 2.0 \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms (less than a millionth of a millimeter), the research provided new insights into how PS I interacts with different quinones\u2014molecules involved in the transfer of electrons, which is essential for converting sunlight into energy.\n\nThese new insights will help scientists understand how and why these molecules are swapped as photosynthetic organisms evolve and adapt in nature, and in the future, may inform a design for improved versions of PS I for creating solar fuels.\n\nAccording to Lakshmi, the lead corresponding author of the study, \"Increasing global population and climate change uncertainties have compelled enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and yields over the coming decades. This presents a need for a thorough understanding of the adaptation of photosynthetic systems to changes in the environment and the key factors limiting photosynthesis.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

The discovery is part of a larger effort to create engineered photosynthetic systems that use natural processes to produce renewable fuels,\" said the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Chris Gisriel (formerly at Yale University), a primary author of the publication.\n\nCurrent methods for producing hydrogen often rely on fossil fuels or inefficient processes, but PS I-based systems have the potential to revolutionize the field by providing a more sustainable and effective solution. This work lays the foundation for further research into bioengineered energy systems and could eventually contribute to the development of large-scale, eco-friendly fuel production, helping to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and combat climate change.\n\nMore information: Christopher J.

            "article_content": "Recently, Amazon announced a multi-year partnership with Orbital Materials to use their \u2018proprietary AI platform\u2019 to develop new materials that help decarbonise their data centres. Orbital is synthesising and designing advanced materials for data centre-integrated carbon removal and cooling technology for Amazon.\n\n\u201cTogether, AWS and Orbital will evaluate the scalability and performance of these new technologies in removing carbon and increasing efficiency,\u201d said Amazon in the report.\n\nOrbital, like any other materials science lab using AI, said that the development of new materials has \u2018traditionally been a slow process of trial and error in the lab,\u2019 and generative AI has significantly improved the timeframe for discovering these materials.\n\n\u201cOrbital has achieved a 10x improvement in its material\u2019s performance through the use of its AI platform\u2014an order of magnitude faster than traditional development and breaking new ground in carbon removal efficacy,\u201d the startup announced. The company also plans to deploy and test these carbon removal technologies by the end of 2025.\n\nOrbital\u2019s claims of a \u2018radical\u2019 improvement in the speed of material discovery are also backed by research findings from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), suggesting we\u2019re living in a golden age of material discovery.\n\nThe Golden Age of Materials Science?\n\nRecent research from MIT outlines the potential of AI technologies and their assistance to scientists, specifically those working on materials science. The author revealed statistics after handing over \u2018new materials discovery technology\u2019 to 1018 scientists in an unnamed \u2018R&D lab of a large US firm\u2019.\n\nThe data showed a 44% increase in new material discovery, a 39% increase in patent filings, and a 17% increase in product prototypes that incorporated these newly discovered materials.\n\n\u201cTrained on the composition and characteristics of existing materials, the model generates recipes for novel compounds predicted to possess specified properties,\u201d said Aidan Toner-Rodgers.\n\nInterestingly, the research also revealed that 82% of scientists reported a reduced level of satisfaction with their work, as they found that leveraging AI decreased creativity and skill underutilisation.\n\nThe advent of AI revolutionising materials science began last year, when Google DeepMind released research titled \u2018Scaling deep learning for material discovery\u2019, where they discovered 2.2 million new crystals, equivalent to 800 years of work of knowledge. Out of which, 380,000 materials were stable materials.\n\n\u201cFor example, 52,000 new layered compounds similar to graphene have the potential to revolutionise electronics with the development of superconductors,\u201d said DeepMind in the announcement.\n\nGoogle DeepMind went beyond discovery and also published another research stating that 41 out of 58 selected materials were successfully synthesised in just 17 days.\n\nMeta marked its foray into material size by releasing a massive data set called Open Materials 2024, or OMat24. The dataset contains over 118 million examples of material simulations and structures, focusing on a wide range of inorganic bulk materials to improve AI-enabled material discovery.\n\nNew Materials, Really?\n\nDeep learning has amplified materials research and discovery for a few years now. However, if there\u2019s one way AI can save humanity, it lies in not just discovering new materials, but also finding ways to synthesise and manufacture them in commercial capabilities.\n\nWhen Google Deepmind made the announcement last year, the company did not take long for contradictory results to come into the picture, where a researcher said that many of the materials discovered weren\u2019t truly novel and were just minor variations of known compounds. It also said that Google Deepmind mostly focused on the stability of the materials, overlooking functionalities that are required for practical applications.\n\nMoreover, Google\u2019s claim of synthesising these newly discovered materials using an autonomous lab is also facing scrutiny, thanks to a study from Princeton University. The researchers here outright deny Google Deepmind\u2019s claim. They said that none of the materials produced by the autonomous lab were new and that the majority were misclassified.\n\nThe authors also say that a majority of the synthetic products were wrongly characterised. It failed to distinguish between materials with random and organised atomic arrangements. In short, the authors said that AI can generate predictions but will struggle to interpret experimental results accurately.\n\nWhen Do I Use It\n\nPresuming these challenges are overcome in discovering and synthesising new materials, but when can we hold these new materials?\n\nIt is indeed a very long journey. Benjamin Reinhardt, CEO at Speculative Technologies, puts it best in his work: Getting materials out of the Lab.\n\n\u201cYou can think of lab-scale materials as the most artisanal products in the world, painstakingly handcrafted by people with advanced degrees. Like any artisanal product, lab-scale materials are expensive,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTrying to mass-produce these materials by simply increasing the number of fume hoods, test tubes, and pipette wielders would make them cost billions of dollars per kilogram.\u201d\n\nMass-producing or scaling these newly discovered materials remains a challenge. From analysing the materials\u2019 failure modes in controlled conditions to setting up an industrial-scale factory, following regulations, and justifying the choices to investors and customers, one is surely set to turn into Sisyphus.\n\nScientists, mostly working in universities, have strong incentives to focus on novelty and one-off demonstrations because these can lead to publications and positive media attention.\n\n\u201cStart-ups commercialising a new material face many headwinds, including often-unavoidable relationships with larger companies, trade-offs between speed and profit margins, and capital constraints,\u201d said Reinhardt.\n\nMoreover, newly discovered materials need to go through a lot of testing, and the world has seen quite a few tragedies when they\u2019re put out in the real world. For instance, carbon fibre, and composite materials are all the rage. We don\u2019t need to look far behind in the history books. In the recent OceanGate\u2019s tragic implosion, the Titan submersible was using an \u2018experimental carbon fibre composite hull\u2019. It was the first instance of the material being used in a submersible.\n\nAn investigation revealed that the hull may have been prone to micro buckling and delamination under deepsea pressures. Small manufacturing imperfections in carbon-fiber material could amplify such issues.\n\nIn 2017, the Grenfell Tower fire in London, claimed 72 lives owing to the building\u2019s exterior cladding. It was made of aluminium composite panel panels with a polyethylene core and flammable insulation materials. The combination led to a rapid spread of fire, and investigations revealed that manufacturers exploited loopholes in regulation.\n\nTherefore, there will be an increased sense of caution before these materials come to life. In the essay, Reinhardt also provided a dataset that visualises the timeline from when materials were discovered and fully commercialised.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves. The next time it seems exciting when AI has discovered new materials, it\u2019s time to give ourselves a reality check. There\u2019s no doubt AI has the potential to speed up the manufacturing process as well, but we\u2019re yet to see how.\n\n[This story has been read by 115 unique individuals.]\n\n\n\n"

There's no organization. But the dream is for the web to feel like a database.\u201d\n\nWebsets is aimed at power users who need to look for things that other search engines aren\u2019t great at finding, such as types of people or companies. Ask it for \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and you get a list of specific companies hundreds long rather than hit-or-miss links to web pages that mention those terms. Google can\u2019t do that, says Bryk: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of valuable use cases for investors or recruiters or really anyone who wants any sort of data set from the web.\u201d\n\nThings have moved fast since MIT Technology Review broke the news in 2021 that Google researchers were exploring the use of large language models in a new kind of search engine. The idea soon attracted fierce critics. But tech companies took little notice. Three years on, giants like Google and Microsoft jostle with a raft of buzzy newcomers like Perplexity and OpenAI, which launched ChatGPT Search in October, for a piece of this hot new trend.\n\nExa isn\u2019t (yet) trying to out-do any of those companies. Instead, it\u2019s proposing something new. Most other search firms wrap large language models around existing search engines, using the models to analyze a user\u2019s query and then summarize the results. But the search engines themselves haven\u2019t changed much. Perplexity still directs its queries to Google Search or Bing, for example. Think of today\u2019s AI search engines as a sandwich with fresh bread but stale filling.\n\nMore than keywords\n\nExa provides users with familiar lists of links but uses the tech behind large language models to reinvent how search itself is done. Here\u2019s the basic idea: Google works by crawling the web and building a vast index of keywords that then get matched to users\u2019 queries. Exa crawls the web and encodes the contents of web pages into a format known as embeddings, which can be processed by large language models.\n\nEmbeddings turn words into numbers in such a way that words with similar meanings become numbers with similar values. In effect, this lets Exa capture the meaning of text on web pages, not just the keywords.\n\nA screenshot of Websets showing results for the search: \"companies; startups; US-based; healthcare focus; technical co-founder\"\n\nLarge language models use embeddings to predict the next words in a sentence. Exa\u2019s search engine predicts the next link. Type \u201cstartups making futuristic hardware\u201d and the model will come up with (real) links that might follow that phrase.\n\nExa\u2019s approach comes at cost, however. Encoding pages rather than indexing keywords is slow and expensive. Exa has encoded some billion web pages, says Bryk. That\u2019s tiny next to Google, which has indexed around a trillion. But Bryk doesn\u2019t see this as a problem: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to embed the whole web to be useful,\u201d he says. (Fun fact: \u201cexa\u201d means a 1 followed by 18 0s and \u201cgoogol\u201d means a 1 followed by 100 0s.)"

The study identifies the most widely used free and open-source software (FOSS) as application libraries. Among its key insights, the study underlines the ongoing importance of open source collaboration.\n\nCensus III is the third study investigating the widespread use of open source software and provides the most comprehensive aggregation of data to date. Derived from over 12 million observations of FOSS libraries in production applications at more than ten thousand companies, the report highlights critical trends shaping the open source ecosystem.\n\nThe Census III effort was conducted in partnership with Harvard University and leading software composition analysis (SCA) organizations, including Black Duck, FOSSA, Snyk, and Sonatype. This collaboration advances the state of open source research by combining insights and resources to better understand the value and security of the OSS ecosystem.\n\nKey Findings of Census III Report\n\nThe report highlights several key trends and insights, such as: The use of cloud service-specific packages is increasing. There is an ongoing transition from Python 2 to Python 3. Maven packages continue to be widely used, and there is an increased prevalence of NuGet and Python packages. Use of components from Rust package repositories has increased considerably since Census II. There continues to be a need for the use of standardized naming schema for software components. Much of the most widely used FOSS is developed by only a handful of contributors. Individual developer account security is increasingly important. Legacy software persists in the open-source space.\n\nCensus III is authored by Frank Nagle, Harvard Business School; Kate Powell, Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard; Richie Zitomer, Harvard Business School; and David A. Wheeler, Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), The Linux Foundation.\n\nTo read the report, download the Census III of Free and Open Source Software\u2014Application Libraries research study on the Linux Foundation website.\n\nSupporting Quotes\n\nLinux Foundation\n\n\"Understanding the health and security posture of open source software is a critical step to ensure its sustainability. Census III underscores the importance of identifying and supporting widely used open-source components, complementing Linux Foundation projects, initiatives, and security-focused research, and it comes at a critical time as we navigate regulations like the Cyber Resilience Act. These insights are vital for prioritizing resources in our efforts to steward a secure and resilient open source ecosystem.\"\n\n-Hilary Carter, SVP Research, The Linux Foundation\n\nOpenSSF\n\n\u201cFOSS is now ubiquitous, serving as a foundational infrastructure of society. However, its success has also made it a target for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. This study provides valuable insights that will help individuals and organizations worldwide prioritize their investments to significantly reduce both the recurrence and impact of vulnerabilities in FOSS\u2014both unintentional and malicious. This marks a critical step in safeguarding our software supply chains against attacks and ensuring they deliver reliable, high-quality results.\u201d\n\n- David A. Wheeler, Director of Open Source Supply Chain Security, Open Source Software Foundation (OpenSSF)\n\nHarvard Business School\n\n\u201cFree and open source software has become the backbone of the digital economy. However, understanding which projects are critical to sustaining the FOSS ecosystem is difficult since there is limited ability to centrally measure the most widely used packages. Census III provides deep and broad insights into this problem as it measures which FOSS packages companies are most heavily reliant on and offers guidance for organizations and individuals who want to invest to support and secure this essential public good.\u201d\n\n- Frank Nagle, Harvard Business School\n\nBlack Duck\n\n\u201cThe ubiquity of FOSS as both foundational software and as an innovation engine demands that companies understand that the health of the FOSS they consume is a business risk just as any other supply chain risk. If there are only a handful of contributors to a critical component or if the supplier is effectively one anonymous GitHub user account, the cybersecurity and software hygiene decisions of those individuals could introduce unexpected business risks.\u201d\n\n- Tim Mackey, Head of Software Supply Chain Risk Strategy, Black Duck\n\nFOSSA\n\n\u201cThis third multi-party open-source census from the Linux Foundation and Harvard is an important examination of the FOSS ecosystem, and I'm proud FOSSA was asked to contribute again. The report clearly reaffirms the ubiquity and continued growing influence of open source on the economy, but more than that, it plays a material part in the trend towards greater transparency. Government regulations, industry initiatives, and research like this are all instrumental in improving the software supply chain through open communication, which ultimately builds trust. On behalf of the thousands of organizations who use FOSSA and share our love of open source, thank you!\u201d\n\n- Kevin Wang, CEO, FOSSA\n\nSnyk\n\n\"Free and Open Source Software forms the backbone of modern technology, yet its decentralized nature presents challenges in understanding its true impact and vulnerabilities. Efforts like the Free and Open Software Census are pivotal, combining community-driven data with analytical rigor to help the industry identify critical dependencies and prioritize investments. By sharing data and fostering collaboration among developers, organizations, policymakers, and academia, we can secure and sustain the health of this invaluable ecosystem for the digital economy\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n- Danny Allan, Chief Technology Officer, Snyk\n\nSonatype\n\n\"Sonatype is proud to contribute to the Census III effort as part of our commitment to strengthening the open source ecosystem. By providing critical data and insights into FOSS usage, we aim to empower organizations to make informed decisions about securing their software supply chains.\"\n\n- Brian Fox, Co-Founder and CTO, Sonatype\n\nBackground on Census Projects I & II\n\nThe original Census Project (\u201cCensus I\u201d), conducted in 2015, centered on identifying critical software packages within the Debian Linux distribution that are essential to server operations and security. This initial effort provided a foundational understanding of the most vital components of the FOSS ecosystem, helping stakeholders prioritize their security and maintenance efforts.\n\nCensus II expanded the scope to include a broader analysis of language-level FOSS packages commonly used in applications developed by both private and public organizations. By broadening the lens beyond Debian, this phase captured a more comprehensive view of how FOSS is integrated into diverse applications and infrastructure, providing deeper insights into the dependencies that organizations rely on for their day-to-day operations.\n\nBuilding on these efforts, Census III takes the initiative even further by leveraging anonymized usage data from leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) partners. This collaboration allows for a more robust and data-driven understanding of FOSS adoption and security trends. With this enhanced dataset, Census III offers actionable insights to help stakeholders better prioritize resources and address critical security challenges within the FOSS ecosystem. This progression underscores the growing need for collaboration and coordination across the industry to sustain and secure the vital infrastructure that FOSS represents.\n\nAdditional Resources"
