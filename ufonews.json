            "article_content": "A US military witness with over 25 years of experience has revealed his own late night encounter with a UFO, that lit up his campsite and 'made absolutely no noise.'\n\nThe event came less than a month before a more senior ex-Pentagon counter-intel official, Luis Elizondo, testified before Congress accusing government actors of secretly working to 'hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.'\n\nThe October 21, 2024 campsite UFO, according to the military witness who requested anonymity, hovered as close as 100 yards above him along the treeline: 'The entire area lit up brighter than the brightest full moon I\u2019ve ever seen,' he reported.\n\n'I knew it wasn\u2019t the moon because I had already located the moon prior,' the trained observer noted of this 20\u201330 foot UFO. '[The moon] was a dimly lit waning gibbous.'\n\nThe career military man, who reported this episode to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), added: 'I observed it for at least a minute before fear took over and I sank back down into the bed of my truck and into my sleeping bag.'\n\nThe oval-shaped 'stationary, bright white light' resembles one newly public case reported this November by Connecticut policeman Robert Klein, who professed that an orb UFO, the size of a Mini Cooper, 'lit up the entire cab' of his patrol car in 2022.\n\nFear over roughly car-sized 'unidentified aerial phenomena' (UAP), often described as 'mystery drones,' has swept the nation since November as sightings across New Jersey and surrounding states have eerily matched cases over US military bases.\n\nLocal leaders in the Garden State are 'livid,' according to journalist and author Michael Shellenberger, who obtained audio from a video briefing delivered to more than 500 New Jersey mayors by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nA US military witness with over 25 years of experience has revealed a late night encounter with a UFO that lit up his campsite. Above, Nest camera footage from a July 24, 2019 UFO case in Leominster, MA, in which a similar brightly lit object (a possible meteor) zoomed across the sky\n\nThe US military witness saw their 30-40 foot long, oval shaped UFO while camping at the the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsites just southwest of Joshua Tree National Park in California. Above: the Milky Way galaxy seen over a Joshua Tree in the park on May 12, 2024\n\n'One of them [i.e. a mayor] got up there,' Shellenberger told Fox News, 'and said, \"I had two automobile-sized drones hovering over my house.\"'\n\nThe newly public military witness's case, as he told NUFORC was itself roughly 8\u201310 feet tall, making this bright oval UFO about the size of a school bus.\n\nThe sighting, which the military man said lasted for over a full minute, occurred at the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsites, just southwest of Joshua Tree National Park in California where he was 'the only camper/hunter in the area that night.'\n\n'I was laying in the tarped bed of my truck,' he told NURFOC, a 501(c)3 nonprofit that has coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on UFOs for decades.\n\n'It was pitch black out,' he said, as the waning gibbous moon was shining weakly \u2014 when 'instantly' the ordinary noises of the insects and animals in the wild 'went completely silent' as the UFO appeared.\n\n'It made absolutely no noise, didn\u2019t pulsate or move, and did not radiate any sort of heat,' he said, adding the temperature was 'about 40 degrees Fahrenheit' that night.\n\nBy his estimation, this 'stationary, bright white light' was 'about the size of a medium sized helicopter but with the light encompassing the entire object' as it hovered at 'tree top level, behind an about 30-40 foot tall pine tree, only about 100 yards away.'\n\nThe encounter, which ended as abruptly as it began, differed from Officer Klein's encounter with a car-sized glowing orb UFO in that the Connecticut policeman's sighting pulsated its light from white to red to green to orange.\n\nThe veteran cop took pains to emphasize to NewsNation that, in the early moments of his encounter, he was able to get 'a very close-up view of it' from 30 feet below the hovering, orb-like object: 'It wasn't a drone \u2014 I can guarantee you that.'\n\nSwarms of drones have been spotted in the skies of New Jersey for weeks, sparking officials to call for a 'limited state of emergency' - with drone bans taking effect in some areas\n\nMayor Mike Ghassali of Montvale, New Jersey took to Facebook to reveal what happened to a resident's quadcopter drone when they had a run-in with a mysterious drone UFO hovering in the air nearby - noting there was 'sophisticated' technology at play in this December 15 event\n\nThe military witness delivered the coordinates of his October 2024 UFO sighting as 33 degrees 32' 12.8\" North and 116 degrees 27' 38.7\" West (red pin, above) - placing him at the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsite east of Los Angeles at the time of his\n\n'I froze,' Klein said, recalling that moment looking up at the object. 'I wasn't in fear. I just was really trying to understand what exactly I was looking at.'\n\n'I was trying to just process what I was looking at,' he said. 'Still to this day, I'm perplexed.'\n\nSpeaking before Congress this past November, Luis Elizondo, the former head of the Defense Department's UFO-hunting Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), criticized federal officials for 'excessive secrecy' on the UFO issue.\n\n'I believe that we as Americans can handle the truth. And I also believe the world deserves the truth,' Elizondo said.\n\nThe former intelligence officer also urged Congress to pass legislation that would protect government whistleblowers afraid to reveal what they know about UFOs, a common refrain among those testifying at the November 13, 2024 open hearing.\n\nThe hearing, held by the House Oversight committee, was part of a larger investigation into UFOs to determine whether any government officials have been withholding evidence from Congress.\n\n'Advanced technologies not made by our government, or any other government, are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe,' Elizondo insisted, raising unsettling implications for the rash of 'mystery drone' sightings at US bases.\n\nIn recent months, the Garden State has been ravaged by thousands of unexplained drone sightings, as over 5,000 reports of odd drones have been filed with federal law enforcement\n\nAlthough misidentifications of conventional planes have been rife amid the growing public panic, reports by from US military officials across America and Europe, alongside local police, have told matching accounts of these car-sized drones.\n\nThe drone swarm's lighting colors, as well as its behavior, match those that also made repeated brazen incursions over the restricted airspace above Air Force joint-base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, then home to America's stealth F-22 fighter fleet.\n\nFor at least 17 nights in December 2023, swarms of these noisy, small UFOs were also seen at dusk 'moving at rapid speeds' and 'flashing red, green, and white lights.'\n\nAnd these cases are almost identical to what has been reported above sensitive sites in New Jersey, like the US Army's Picatinny Arsenal, since mid-November 2024.\n\nBase police have reported 11 confirmed and unauthorized drone sightings over the arsenal since November 13, meaning security officers 'visibly witnessed a drone.'\n\nSenior ex-Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com last October that the unexplained incursions over Langley-Eustis were 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\n'In fact, in some instances,' as Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'"

            "article_content": "CHINA has unveiled the world's first sixth-generation fighter jet - an ultra-stealth spy craft without a tail.\n\nSocial media was flooded with footage showing the futuristic \"super weapon\", touted by experts as the \"most advanced\u201d ever, arcing through the sky.\n\n6 The clearest image of the new Chinese stealth jet Credit: X\n\n6 A still from the viral footage of the test flight Credit: Twitter / @TheInsiderPaper\n\n6\n\nThe sixth-generation jet test flight is the latest in a flurry of advancements in the Chinese military aircraft programme.\n\nMilitary experts have said the latest model marks a significant shift in aerial dominance towards China.\n\nThe video shows the huge grey jet, named unofficially as the J-36, gliding through the air in broad daylight.\n\nThe diamond-shaped \"modified delta wing\" design has a huge surface area, blotting out a large area of the sky.\n\nNo official information has been released about the jet, but it is believed to be the first sixth-generation fighter jet to be publicly exhibited in the world.\n\nIt has been claimed the Chinese government wanted footage of the new jet to circulate online because they made no effort to stop the spread of information.\n\nThe test flight also came on December 26, thought to have been deliberately chosen to coincide with the birthday of the dictator Mao Zedong, who founded the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nSeveral countries including the US have been racing to develop a sixth-generation jet so, if confirmed, this would mark a significant victory for the Chinese air force.\n\nThe new jet was flanked by a two-seater Chengdu J-20S chase plane, allowing for some comparison.\n\nThe unique design of the new aircraft is tailless, meaning it uses computers rather than vertical stabilisers to maintain control.\n\nTailless designs are much harder to detect with radar, indicating the jet is likely to be used for stealth missions.\n\nIt also makes the craft more aerodynamic by reducing drag, so it could be used for long-rang endurance flights.\n\nImages suggest the new plane is at least as long as the J-20, which is around 70ft.\n\nHypersonic \u2018jumbo jet ROCKET\u2019 hits 5,000mph in major step toward goal of flying passengers anywhere on Earth in 60mins\n\nThe body of the jet is very large compared to its length meaning it can carry large quantities of fuel, again suggesting it will be deployed on long-range missions.\n\nThe \u201cmost unusual\u201d feature of the jet is the position of the air intakes on top of the fuselage and on either side.\n\nThis has led to speculation of a \u201chighly unorthodox\u201d three-engine arrangement.\n\nEuan Graham, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the new designs \"show the willingness of China's aviation industry to experiment and innovate\".\n\n\"Whatever the merits or demerits, it appears to be a highly original design,\" he said.\n\n\"They deserve kudos for that, and should shake off any lingering complacency that the U.S. and its allies always set the pace.\"\n\nThe flight jet took to the skies over Chengdu, the capital of the Sichuan province, and is thought to have been manufactured by the Chengdu Aerospace Corporation (CAC).\n\nA few hours after the jet took flight, footage began to emerge of a second new, slightly smaller aircraft launched from the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation facility.\n\nRace to create 6th Generation fighter jets Sixth-generation fighter jets are the most advanced aircraft design - one up on the fifth generation jets already deployed by various airforces. Multiple countries have been known to be attempting to develop a sixth-generation fighter, including China, the US and Russia. Other countries have joined forces on sixth-gen projects, such as the UK, Japan and Italy in the Global Combat Air Programme, and France, Germany and Spain with FCAS. Sixth-generation fighter concepts share several distinct characteristics, such as the inclusion of AI and advanced stealth capabilities. If the jet spotted in the video footage is indeed a sixth-generation fighter jet, then China appears to have taken a significant step forward at the front of the race. The debut of the J-36 jet challenges US superiority in the skies and could have serious implications for India, which currently lacks a stealth fighter jet. It is anticipated the US will deploy its first sixth-generation fighter to the field around 2030.\n\n6 The new jet, on the left, accompanied by a Chinese Chengdu J-20S Credit: X\n\nThe demo of the new plane comes just a month after China unveiled the J-35 fighter jet, which bore a striking similarity to an American design, the F-35.\n\nIt was even claimed that the fifth generation fighter was built from designs for the American craft which were stolen by Xi Jinping's agents.\n\nAt the airshow the China released plans for a mysterious \"White Emperor\" jet design - capable of dropping devastating weapons from space.\n\nHowever, it is not thought this was the design captured in the recent footage.\n\nChina is also vying to take on the US \"Son of Concorde\" with an even faster supersonic jet that could blast from London to New York City in less than two hours.\n\nBeijing-based Space Transportation - also known as Lingkong Tianxing Technology - has been carrying out test flights and recently reached a speed of 3,106 mph which is four times the speed of sound, according to Chinese media.\n\n6 There has been no official information released about the new jet Credit: X"

            "article_content": "When Cerelia Hampton began work as an English department supervisor at Bremen High School District 228 two years ago, the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT had just begun making waves in education.\n\n\u201cI happened to be in the teacher workspace, and (teachers) were all talking about this,\u201d Hampton said. \u201cA couple people turned to me and said, \u2018Cerelia, what are we going to do? All of the kids are going to cheat on their papers.'\u201d\n\nDistrict 228 teachers were not alone in their immediate skepticism of a free-to-use online AI chatbot that spits out responses to user generated prompts almost instantaneously. According to a Pew Research Center survey from fall 2023, a quarter of kindergarten through high school teachers say AI tools result in more harm than good for K-12 education. Only 6% said they believe the reverse.\n\nHowever, since Hampton began digging into ChatGPT and other AI tools with classroom applications, she and other District 228 leaders have become more enthusiastic about the inclusion of such tools in teaching and learning.\n\n\u201cWhen the Internet first came around, we thought that was going to change education and ruin it,\u201d said Jim Broswell, director of operations and technology for the district. \u201cIt did change it, but it didn\u2019t ruin it, it just put it in a different place. I think the same things are happening with AI.\u201d\n\nBroswell said he understands AI can create fear among teachers as students find new ways to cheat or plagiarize and said some districts have looked to curtail the technology\u2019s use in schools. But Bremen 228 has taken the opposite approach, embracing the potential of AI to not only help students in their research and studying, but also for teachers to detect potential issues with turned in work.\n\n\u201cI think the thing that we\u2019re doing that\u2019s working really well is that we don\u2019t have hard and fast policies,\u201d Broswell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a culture where people are trying AI, and they\u2019re finding out the good and the bad, and then as we go we\u2019re taking that feedback and shaping what it\u2019s going to look like here in our district.\u201d\n\nThe district has involved educators in developing their open minded approach, Broswell said, by forming a technology committee of 30 teachers from departments across the district\u2019s four high schools: Tinley Park, Oak Forest, Hillcrest in Country Club Hills and Bremen in Midlothian.\n\nThe committee was tasked with research surrounding AI and education, even taking part in a full-day workshop given by an AI expert with the Illinois Learning Technology Center.\n\nTeachers learned that more successful than banning students from using AI is providing them guidelines of ethical versus unethical applications. Hampton said one example is allowing 11th grade students writing essays on college and career readiness to use ChatGPT to search ideas for topics to write about, but not to conduct research or draft.\n\n\u201cI witnessed a teacher utilize ChatGPT with her class just to generate interview questions for someone they wanted to interview about their career,\u201d Hampton said. \u201cThat was very cool to see, because it\u2019s not writing the actual paper, it\u2019s just getting the ideas going.\u201d\n\nHampton and Broswell said outside of making students aware of when AI use is permitted, teachers have learned to craft assessments that make cheating with AI more difficult.\n\nBroswell said useful approaches teachers learned include straying from simple wording of prompts on assessments in favor of more complex \u201cAI proof questions\u201d as well as requiring students complete more of their work in the classroom, without access to devices. He\u2019s also found AI tools can help teachers with this work in such ways as creating different versions of tests so students in different class periods can\u2019t share answers.\n\n\u201cThe things that teachers are using (AI) for are nothing but positive,\u201d Broswell said. \u201cI think it\u2019s been a force multiplier \u2014 teachers have been asked to do more and more over the years \u2026 Time is a concern, but now we have these supercharged tools that are allowing us to do what we want more frequently at better quality.\u201d\n\nostevens@chicagotribune.com"

            "article_content": "Let\u2019s be honest; the whole idea of a prequel makes no sense.\n\nNarratives have to move forward, advancing the life of the main character. It\u2019s counter-intuitive to take a character to point B in one story just to start another story before point A. That\u2019s why so many franchises prefer to reboot, like the 2009 Star Trek or 2011\u2019s Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nHowever, some talented filmmakers have managed to use the prequel structure to their advantage. Playing on the audience\u2019s expectations and knowledge, these movies take a character back before the start and show how they became the heroes we wanted to follow in the first place.\n\n1. The Godfather, Part II (1974)\n\nImage Credit: Paramount Pictures.\n\nOn one hand, director Francis Ford Coppola kind of cheats with The Godfather, Part II, as the narrative splits between the rise of the new Don Michael (Al Pacino) and the arrival in America of his father Vito (now played by Robert De Niro).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, The Godfather, Part II is one of the greatest movies of all time, showing how the mistreatment of immigrants drove newcomers to rely on the mafia while also showing the cost of those decisions in the present.\n\n2. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024)\n\nImage Credit: Jasin Boland; Warner Bros.\n\nCharlize Theron and her soulful take on the Imperator Furiosa stole the show from Tom Hardy as the title character in Mad Max: Fury Road. But when the long production time for the prequel Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga forced Theron to leave the project, she left behind some giant shoots for incoming actor Anya Taylor-Joy to fill.\n\nTaylor-Joy proves more than up to the challenge, thanks in part to the more deliberate story that Miller and co-writer Nico Lathouris tell in Furiosa. Add in an unhinged performance from Chris Hemsworth, and Furiosa shows how the title character made the brave decision that sent her down the fury road.\n\n3. Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me (1992)\n\nImage Credit: New Line Cinema.\n\nFive minutes into the first episode of Twin Peaks, the cult television show by David Lynch and Mark Frost, viewers see the dead body of homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) wrapped in plastic.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me looks back at the last week of Laura\u2019s life, elevating her from a mere victim to a conflicted figure who has agency over her fate.\n\n4. Final Destination 5 (2011)\n\nImage Credit: Doane Gregory; New Line Productions, Inc.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinal Destination 5 works so well as a prequel because it doesn\u2019t act like one. Most of the movie, directed by Steven Quale and written by Eric Heisserer, plays like any other entry in the cult horror series.\n\nBut in the final moments, the main characters (portrayed by Nicholas D\u2019Agosto and Emma Bell) celebrate the fact that they\u2019ve survived an ordeal by boarding a plane. Turns out, it\u2019s the same plane that gets destroyed at the start of the first Final Destination movie, thus completing the circle.\n\n5. Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century-Fox.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear how the recent run of Planet of the Apes movies connects to the first film from 1968. But even if the new story of Caesar never leads to Dr. Zaius, Zira, and Cornelius, the third, fourth, and fifth movies of the original series go back before the Planet of the Apes.\n\nAfter the Earth blows up in Beneath the Planet of the Apes, Escape from the Planet of the Apes begins with Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) arriving in 1971 America, setting off a chain of events that leads to intelligent apes in the future.\n\n6. Pearl (2022)\n\nImage Credit: Christopher Moss \u2013 Origin Picture Show LLC/A24.\n\nJust weeks after the slasher X hit theaters, director Ti West revealed that he and star Mia Goth made another movie together, the prequel Pearl. Written by West and Goth, Pearl takes place on the same farm as X and checks in with that movie\u2019s elderly killer as a young woman.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoth portrayed the older Pearl under piles of make-up in X. But Pearl allows her to perform without such limitations, letting her add layers to the damaged psyche of the future killer.\n\n7. Monsters University (2013)\n\nImage Credit: Pixar/Disney Studios.\n\nAt the start of Monsters University, go-getter Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) comes to school ready to become a scarer against the taunts of his privileged but lazy roommate, Sully (John Goodman).\n\nOf course, any who saw Monsters, Inc. knows that Mike never becomes a scarer, but he does become best pals with Sully. Director Dan Scanlon, who co-wrote the script with Dan Gerson and Robert L. Baird, uses that knowledge to tell a moving story about dealing with failure and disappointment.\n\n8. Prometheus (2012)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Studios\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFans cheered at the news that director Ridley Scott would come back to the Alien franchise that he started in 1979, especially when they learned he\u2019d be making a prequel to that first film.\n\nHowever, Scott exceeded all expectations with Prometheus, which uses the world of Alien for theological exploration more than horror, all while showing why the Weyland-Yutani company took such interest in the xenomorph in the first place.\n\n9. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (2023)\n\nImage Credit: Murray Close/Lionsgate.\n\nWhen The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes hit theaters in 2023, no one expected much from a prequel of a series that ended its story almost a decade earlier.\n\nHowever, Songbirds & Snakes won over fans, in part because of Rachel Zegler\u2019s winning turn in the lead and in part because of the film\u2019s look at the life of franchise villain Coriolanus Snow, reimagined as a complicated young man played by Tom Blyth.\n\n10. Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Fox.\n\nStar Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace relaunched the Star Wars franchise by turning Darth Vader into a cute little blond boy. By the end of Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith, little Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) had grown up and traveled down the dark path.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe specific reasons for Yoda going into hiding and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) watching over young Luke don\u2019t make too much sense, but Episode III does complete the origin of Darth Vader, making him into a tragic figure.\n\n11. X-Men: First Class (2011)\n\nImage Credit: Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.\n\nNo part of the timeline in the X-Men movie franchise makes much sense, but director Matthew Vaughn gets the important parts right for the prequel X-Men: First Class. By casting Michael Fassbender as Magneto and James McAvoy as Professor X, Vaughn recreates the tension of the previous films.\n\nFurthermore, Vaughn and his co-writers Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, and Jane Goldman use the 1960s setting of First Class to tie the heroes into real-world events, including the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\n12. Wonka (2023)\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNobody ever needed an origin story for Mr. Wonka, the chocolatier from Roald Dahl\u2019s novels and the movie adaptations, one featuring a beloved performance by Gene Wilder and the other a tolerated performance by Johnny Depp.\n\nBut thanks to the whimsy that writer and director Paul King brought to the Paddington films, Wonka wins over even cynical viewers who want to learn how Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s penniless dreamer opens his own chocolate factory.\n\n13. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)\n\nImage Credit: Lucasfilm, Ltd.\n\nOne would be forgiven for not realizing that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is a prequel to Indy\u2019s first adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark. At no point do writer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg, working from a screenplay by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz, wink toward the previous film.\n\nHowever, the darker-edged Temple of Doom does see Indy (Harrison Ford) dropping his cynicism and becoming the hero he is in Raiders.\n\n14. The Thing (2011)\n\nImage Credit: Universal Pictures.\n\nThe 1982 classic The Thing begins with Norwegian scientists chasing a dog across the Arctic to a nearby American outpost, warning that the dog is, in fact, a monster. The 2011 film The Thing, directed by Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. and written by Eric Heisserer, goes back to show what happened to those Norwegians.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe 2011 movie\u2019s digital effects don\u2019t hold a candle to Rob Bottin\u2019s creature designs from the 1982 film, but van Heijningen finds clever ways to set up iconic images from the Carpenter movie.\n\n15. The First Purge (2018)\n\nImage Credit: Universal Pictures.\n\n2013\u2019s The Purge became a hit despite its ludicrous premise, set in a near-future America where all laws get suspended for an annual 24-hour period.\n\nFor the prequel, The First Purge, director Gerard McMurray and screenwriter James DeMonaco don\u2019t worry about justifying the absurd practice. Instead, they tie the purge to current events, channeling the political anger of the year into thrilling genre filmmaking.\n\n16. Orphan: First Kill (2022)\n\nImage Credit: Steve Ackerman; Paramount Players, a Division of Paramount Pictures.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSo much of the 2009 horror movie Orphan hinged on its big reveal that the killer kid Esther was, in fact, a full-grown adult who just looked like a child.\n\nAlthough director William Brent Bell and writer David Coggeshall got star Isabelle Fuhrman, who was a kid when she shot the first movie, back for the prequel Orphan: First Kill, she was visibly older. To their credit, Bell and Coggeshall take advantage of the audience\u2019s knowledge and disbelief, making Orphan: First Kill a more absurd and fun movie.\n\n17. The First Omen (2024)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Studios.\n\nDespite direction from Richard Donner, 1976\u2019s The Omen always played like an unimpressive knockoff of The Exorcist. Yet, director Arkasha Stevenson doesn\u2019t let that low bar limit her for The First Omen and instead launches into a surreal and wild movie.\n\nFor the most part, The First Omen script by Stevenson, Tim Smith, and Keith Thomas avoids too many winks to the 1976 movie. But by the time it reaches its conclusion (and post-credit scene), The First Omen goes right into The Omen.\n\n18. Infernal Affairs II (2003)\n\nImage Credit: Media Asia Distribution.\n\nMost Americans know Infernal Affairs as the inspiration for Martin Scorsese\u2019s hit crime film The Departed. However, where The Departed stood as its own film, the source franchise continued with the prequel Infernal Affairs II.\n\nInfernal Affairs star Andrew Lau serves as director, along with Alan Mak, for the prequel. Instead, he lets Edison Chen take over as Lau Kin-ming with Shawn Yue as Tony Leung\u2019s character, Chan Wing-yan. Despite these changes, Infernal Affairs II keeps the spirit of the original, showing how cops and criminals got to the point where they could switch places.\n\n19. Saw X (2023)\n\nImage Credit: Alexandro Bola\u00f1os Escamilla; Lionsgate.\n\nNon-horror fans know the Saw franchise as a gore-filled series about death traps. But horror fans also know that the Saw franchise is part police drama with a twisty timeline that would confuse the most hardened soap opera fan.\n\nSaw X, directed by Kevin Greutert and written by Peter Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg, takes advantage of that unusual chronology to set a story between the original Saw and its first sequel, Saw II. There, viewers see the doomed John Kramer (Tobin Bell) take one last chance at a normal life before embracing his identity as the killer Jigsaw.\n\n20. Prey (2022)\n\nImage Credit: David Bukach; Hulu; 20th Century Studios.\n\n1990\u2019s Predator 2 ends with tough cop Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) getting honored by three alien Predators for his ability to defeat one of their members. They reward him with a pistol engraved with the name Raphael Adolini and the year 1715, revealing that the aliens have been coming to Earth for decades.\n\nPrey checks in on one of those early expeditions, with a Predator arriving in the Great Plains in 1719. There, the alien clashes with Comanche Naru (Amber Midthunder), which director Dan Trachtenberg and writer Patrick Aison present as both a set-up for Predator and a satisfying action movie in its own right.\n\n21. Paranormal Activity 3 (2011)\n\nImage Credit: Paramount Pictures.\n\nBy the second entry in the found-footage horror series Paranormal Activity, one begins to wonder why ghosts care so much about sisters Katie and Kristie.\n\nDirectors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, along with writer Christopher Landon, seek to answer that question, going back to girls\u2019 childhood. In addition to some of the most inventive scares in the series, Paranormal Activity 3 also reveals the events that doomed the sisters to lifelong hauntings.\n\n22. Ouija: Origin of Evil (2018)\n\nImage Credit: Universal Pictures.\n\nOuija: Origin of Evil is the rare follow-up film that outdoes its predecessor. Where 2014\u2019s Ouija was an unambitious scary movie about the famous board game Origin of Evil comes from Mike Flanagan, the excellent filmmaker behind Doctor Sleep and The House on Haunted Hill.\n\nSet 47 years before the first film, Origin of Evil, shows how the titular board game got cursed in the first place. While these connections help develop Ouija, the most interesting thing is the rich human drama that Flanagan brings to the film.\n\n23. Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist (2005)\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nIn a weird quirk of Hollywood filmmaking, The Exorcist has not one but two prequels, both based on the same story with the same cast. Both movies show the first encounter between Father Merrin (played by Max von Sydow in the 1973 movie and by Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd in the prequels) and the demon Pazuzu.\n\nBut while Exorcist: The Beginning, directed by Renny Harlin, goes for cheap scares, Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist, directed by Paul Schrader, tries to match the depth of the William Friedkin films.\n\n24. Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990)\n\nImage Credit: Showtime.\n\nThe shocking reveal of 1960\u2019s Psycho left a lot of questions about what happened to Mrs. Bates and how her son Norman (Anthony Perkins) came to develop a second personality around his mother. The TV film Psycho IV: The Beginning, directed by Mick Garris and written by Joseph Stefano, answers that question.\n\nPerkins returns to play Norman, who tells his story to an interviewer, with E.T. star (and frequent Mike Flanagan collaborator) Henry Thomas as the young Norman. The movie tries to humanize the connection between Norman and his mother (Olivia Hussey), which just makes the tale creepier."

            "article_content": "Scientists described numerous new species this past year, the world\u2019s smallest otter in India, a fanged hedgehog from Southeast Asia, tree-dwelling frogs in Madagascar, and a new family of African plants.\n\nExperts estimate that fewer than 20% of Earth\u2019s species have been documented by Western science, with potentially millions more awaiting discovery.\n\nAlthough species may be new to science, many are already known to local and Indigenous peoples and have traditional names and uses.\n\nUpon discovery, many new species are assessed as threatened with extinction, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts. See All Key Ideas\n\nA giant anaconda, a vampire hedgehog, a dwarf squirrel, and a tiger cat were among the new species named by science in 2024. Found from the depths of the Pacific Ocean to the mountaintops of Southeast Asia, each new species shows us that even our well-known world contains unexplored chambers of life.\n\nThis year, in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo Landscape alone, scientists uncovered 27 new-to-science species, including four new mammals, during a two month expedition. Meanwhile, the Greater Mekong region yielded 234 new species, and scientists from the California Academy of Sciences described 138 new species globally. The ocean depths continued to surprise, with more than 100 potentially new species found on an unexplored underwater mountain off Chile\u2019s coast. Two new mammal species were found in India this year, including the world\u2019s smallest otter.\n\nScientists estimate only a small fraction of Earth\u2019s species have been documented, perhaps 20% at best. Even among mammals, the best-known group of animals, scientists think we\u2019ve only found 80% of species. Yet most of the hidden species are likely bats, rodents, shrews, moles and hedgehogs.\n\nHowever, while species may be new to Western science, many have been well known to Indigenous peoples and local communities for generations. These communities often maintain sophisticated classification systems and deep ecological knowledge about species\u2019 behaviors, uses and roles in local ecosystems.\n\n\u201cFor example, the blob-headed fish, which is so bizarre and unusual, and scientists have never seen anything like it, but it\u2019s very familiar to the Awaj\u00fan,\u201d Trond Larsen, the leader of the Alto Mayo expedition in Peru from the NGO Conservation International, told Mongabay. \u201cThey regularly catch and eat them.\u201d Similarly, the ghost palm, newly named by scientists this year, has been used by Iban communities in Borneo for basketry and food for decades.\n\nUnfortunately, many species may be threatened with extinction before they\u2019re even formally named, victims of human activities like development and climate change. Some of these species could be foods or medicines for humans, but each has a unique role in Earth\u2019s interconnected web of life.\n\n\u201cThere is something immensely unethical and troubling about humans driving species extinct without ever even having appreciated their existence and given them consideration,\u201d Walter Jetz, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University, U.S., told Mongabay.\n\nHere\u2019s our look at some of the new-to-science species described in 2024:\n\nVampire hedgehog and glamorous viper among 243 new species from the Greater Mekong\n\nTrimeresurus ciliaris, a pit viper. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nHipposideros kingstonae, a leaf-nosed bat. Image \u00a9 Pipat Soisook.\n\nRhabdophis hmongorum, the H\u2019mong keelback snake. Image \u00a9 Luan Thanh Nguyen.\n\nZhangixalus melanoleucus, a tree frog found in northeast Laos. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nTrimeresurus uetzi, a pit viper found in Myanmar. Image \u00a9 H.T. Lalremsanga.\n\nChiloschista quangdangii, a leafless orchid found in the trade. Image \u00a9 Truong Ba Vuong.\n\nLaodracon carsticola, a karst dragon lizard was first spotted by a guide on a zipline tour in Laos. Image \u00a9 Santi Xayyasith.\n\nThe Greater Mekong region revealed some of the year\u2019s most distinctive species. Local nature enthusiasts and researchers documented a hedgehog species with fang-like teeth, leading to its name vampire hedgehog (Hylomys macarong).\n\nThey also described a pit viper (Trimeresurus ciliaris) whose scales create the appearance of dramatic eyelashes, and a karst dragon lizard (Laodracon carsticola) first noticed by a local tour guide.\n\nThese findings illuminate the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and conservation challenges, as many species face immediate threats from development and wildlife trafficking.\n\nNew giant anaconda species found on Waorani Indigenous land in Ecuador\n\nA significant discovery has been made in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where scientists have identified a new species of giant anaconda in the Bameno region of Baihuaeri Waorani Territory. During their research, the team encountered an impressive female specimen measuring 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) in length from head to tail, though local Indigenous communities report encountering even larger individuals. The species faces multiple threats throughout its range, from deforestation destroying their habitat to direct hunting by humans and environmental degradation from oil spills.\n\nTree-dwelling frogs found in Madagascar\u2019s pandan trees\n\nIn Madagascar\u2019s eastern rainforests, three frog species living in pandan trees received their first scientific descriptions. Known locally as sahona vakoa (pandan frogs), these amphibians complete their entire life cycle within the water-filled spaces between the plants\u2019 spiky leaves. The species, now given the scientific names Guibemantis rianasoa, G. vakoa and G. ambakoana, exemplify how local ecological knowledge often precedes formal scientific documentation by generations.\n\nA new underwater mountain hosts deep-sea wonders off Chile</\n\nAn expedition in the Southeast Pacific discovered more than 100 potentially new-to-science species on a previously unknown underwater mountain, including deep-sea corals (order Scleractinia), glass sponges, sea urchins (class Echinoidea), amphipods (order Amphipoda) and squat lobsters (family Galatheidae).\n\nThe expedition also sighted rare creatures like the flying spaghetti monster (Bathyphysa conifera) and Casper octopus (genus Grimpoteuthis).\n\nThe seamount, rising about 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) from the seafloor, about 1,450 km (900 mi) off Chile\u2019s coast, hosts thriving deep-sea ecosystems with ancient corals and glass sponges. The findings highlight the rich biodiversity of the high seas as the U.N. finalizes treaties to protect international waters.\n\nToothed toads emerge from mountain forests of Vietnam and China\n\nTwo new species of rare, toothed toads were discovered in Vietnam and China: the Mount Po Ma Lung toothed toad (Oreolalax adelphos) and the Yanyuan toothed toad (Oreolalax yanyuanensis). These amphibians are characterized by an unusual row of tiny teeth on the roof of their mouths. The discovery brings the total known toothed toad species to 21. However, more than half are already considered threatened due to habitat loss and degradation.\n\nDwarf squirrel and blobfish among 27 new species found in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo\n\nIn Peru\u2019s densely populated Alto Mayo region, home to 280,000 people, scientists working with local communities documented 27 species previously unknown to Western science.\n\nThe species included an amphibious mouse (Necromys aquaticus) found in just one patch of swamp forest; a fish with an unexplained blob-like head structure (Trichomycterus sp. nov.); an agile dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus sp. nov.); and a tree-climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa sp. nov.). These findings demonstrate how even human-modified landscapes can harbor biodiversity not yet documented by scientists.\n\nThe clouded tiger cat gains species status\n\nScientists formally described a new small wild cat species, the clouded tiger cat (Leopardus pardinoides), found in high-altitude cloud forests from Central to South America. This taxonomic clarification has major conservation implications, as new data indicate all three tiger cat species have experienced dramatic range reductions, with the clouded tiger cat\u2019s habitat particularly threatened by human activities.\n\nA rare ghost palm from Borneo\n\nThough long used by local Iban communities in western Borneo for basketry and edible shoots, scientists finally gave a formal name to a distinctive rattan palm after 90 years. Named Plectocomiopsis hantu (\u201chantu\u201d meaning ghost in Indonesian and Malay), the palm is known for its ghostly appearance, with white undersides to the leaves and gray stems. It\u2019s currently known from only three locations in or near protected rainforest habitats.\n\nA new family of African plants that can\u2019t photosynthesize\n\nScientists named an entirely new family of plants, Afrothismiaceae, which have evolved to take all their nutrients from fungal partners rather than through photosynthesis. Found in African forests, these rare plants only appear above ground to fruit and flower. Most species in this family are extremely rare or possibly extinct, with the majority recorded only once in Cameroon.\n\nNew orchids from Indonesia\n\nThe orchid family is immense, and new species are found most years. This year, researchers described five new species from islands throughout Indonesia. These are: Coelogyne albomarginata from Sumatra, Coelogyne spinifera from Seram, and Dendrobium cokronagoroi, the Dendrobium wanmae (a critically endangered species) and Mediocalcar gemma-coronae (endangered), all from western New Guinea.\n\nA lonely liana faces extinction from cement production in Vietnam\n\nA new genus and species of green-flowered liana, Chlorohiptage vietnamensis, was discovered in Vietnam but is already assessed as critically endangered. Its limestone karst habitat is being cleared for quarries to make cement, threatening the only known population of this unique plant.\n\nTwo new mammals from India\n\nTwo new mammal species in were described in Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, Northeast India\u2019s biggest national park. A forest officer documented the presence of the small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus), the world\u2019s tiniest otter species. The small-clawed otter, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, joins two other otter species already known to inhabit Kaziranga.\n\nThe binturong (Arctictis binturong), an elusive nocturnal tree-dweller also known as the bearcat, was photographed by tour guide Chirantanu Saikia in January 2024. The binturong is found exclusively in Northeast India and requires dense forest canopy for survival. It has become increasingly rare due to deforestation.\n\nWhile local residents had previously reported sightings of both species, these photographs provide the first concrete evidence of their presence in the park. Conservation officials believe these discoveries suggest the potential presence of other undocumented species within the park, highlighting the importance of continued wildlife surveys and protection efforts in the region.\n\nOne of the tiniest frogs ever found in Brazil\n\nScientists in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest described a remarkable new species of frog, Brachycephalus dacnis, measuring just 6.95 millimeters in length \u2013 about the size of a pencil eraser. Unlike other similarly tiny frogs that often struggle with balance, this species has maintained its inner ear structure, allowing it to jump gracefully up to 32 times its body length. The discovery in S\u00e3o Paulo state\u2019s remaining Atlantic Forest highlights both the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and the urgent need for conservation, as this critically threatened ecosystem now stands at just 13% of its original extent, potentially harboring many more undiscovered species.\n\nBanner image of Leopardus pardinoides, or the clouded tiger cat, as a new species.

            "article_content": "HOLLYWOOD, FLA. (WSVN) - A South Florida mother is demanding accountability after, she said, her 11-year-old son was attacked by a teacher while on a field trip.\n\nSpeaking with 7News on Thursday, Yasmine Fran\u00e7ois said the incident occurred while her son Kendrick, a sixth-grade student at McNicol Middle School in Hollywood, was on a field trip at the Museum of Discovery and Science in Fort Lauderdale on Dec. 20.\n\nFran\u00e7ois said she initially got a call that Kendrick had gotten into a fight.\n\nUpon the child\u2019s arrival at home, Fran\u00e7ois took away his phone and prepared to scale back his Christmas gifts.\n\nBut then a friend sent her a video showing the moments after the fight.\n\nThe video, provided by the mother, shows a woman identified by Kendrick as a teacher pulling him into a picnic bench, then jumping on top of him.\n\nAudio from the video captures what sounds like a slap. On top of all that, the woman seen in the clip yelled profanities at the child.\n\nFran\u00e7ois said she was stunned.\n\n\u201cHow do you handle a kid like that? Who does that?\u201d she said.\n\nBefore seeing the video, Fran\u00e7ois said she was skeptical of what had occurred.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You know what? It\u2019s Christmas, he knows he\u2019s in trouble, so he\u2019s probably \u2013 I didn\u2019t believe that. I said, \u2018No teacher would choke you, especially a lady, like no,'\u201d she said.\n\nFran\u00e7ois said her son got a three-day school suspension, adding that the school principal never reported the teacher\u2019s actions which, the concerned mother said, crossed the line.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a teacher and you address your student? That\u2019s the language? Is that the vocabulary you use to speak to a kid? Is that how you speak in the classroom?\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois.\n\nThe mother now wants the teacher to be held accountable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the mom that\u2019s gonna take sides with my son. Like, if you do something bad, you know, you do something bad. I\u2019ll most likely side with the school before I side with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m highly disappointed because I feel like I was misled. They told me what he did. They didn\u2019t tell me what they did to him.\u201d\n\nBroward County Schools did not immediately respond to 7News\u2019 request for comment, as they are on winter break.\n\nThe mother hopes that once school resumes, she can sit down and have a conversation with school officials about what occurred.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

According to leaked documents obtained by The Information, the two companies came to agree in 2023 that AGI will be achieved once OpenAI has developed an AI system that can generate at least $100 billion in profits.\n\nThere has long been a debate in the AI community about what AGI really means, or whether computers will ever be good enough to outperform humans at most tasks and wipe out major swaths of the economy.\n\nThe term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d itself is something of a misnomer because much of it is really just a prediction machine, taking in keywords and searching large amounts of data without really understanding the underlying concepts. But OpenAI has received more than $13 billion in funding from Microsoft over the years, and that money has come with a strange contractual agreement that OpenAI would stop allowing Microsoft to use any new technology it develops after AGI is achieved.\n\nOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit under the guise that it would use its influence, and any AGI that is developed, to create products that benefit all of humanity. The idea behind cutting off Microsoft once AGI is attained is that unfettered access to OpenAI intellectual property could unduly concentrate power in the tech giant. In order to incentivize it for investing billions in the nonprofit then, Microsoft\u2019s current agreement with OpenAI entitles it and other investors to take a slice of profits until they collect $100 billion; the cap is meant to ensure most profit would eventually go back to building products that benefit the entirety of humanity, supposedly. This is all pie-in-the-sky speak since, again, AI is not that powerful at this point.\n\nThe non-profit structure of OpenAI has long been considered a farce, and unsurprisingly the company announced this year intentions to pivot into a for-profit structure (while maintaining its mission to benefit all of humanity, somehow), because the current nonprofit structure makes it difficult to raise more money and compete against other AI players. Consequently, The Information says Microsoft and OpenAI have been negotiating a host of changes to their arrangement that would go into place should the company restructure. Microsoft also currently serves as OpenAI\u2019s exclusive cloud hosting provider, and OpenAI may want to end that as well as stop profit-sharing and switch to simply giving Microsoft straight equity.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI have been on diverging paths for some time now. It was recently reported that the latter has begun incorporating AI models developed in-house into its 365 Copilot product in order to improve cost and efficiency. It doesn\u2019t make sense for Microsoft to continue relying on OpenAI, an independent company developing similar productivity tools, for technology that it believes will be the backbone of its productivity software going forward. Especially with all the chaos and drama that has surrounded OpenAI. Microsoft needs its own proprietary tech to chart its own path.\n\nOpenAI is far away from achieving $100 billion in profit on technology whose true value remains speculative, which means it would likely have to keep handing its technology and profits over to Microsoft for a long time\u2014not great as they head towards becoming competitors and OpenAI seeks new investors, which it will need as it continues to burn billions in cash. Getting rid of the cloud hosting tie-up could also allow OpenAI to negotiate better hosting costs with an alternative provider, something Google has told the FTC in a letter imploring it to nullify the agreement."

Pictured: Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Bucky Irving reacts after making a first down.\n\nAn unorthodox Week 17 in the NFL has already featured two Christmas games on Netflix, along with a showdown looming in the Windy City on Thursday night.\n\nAfter going a perfect 5-0 with last week's NFL picks, let's dive into my selections for the weekend slate. My favorite NFL player props for Week 17 kick-off by backing standout rookie running back Bucky Irving.\n\nNFL Week 17 prop picks\n\nBucky Irving o76.5 rushing yards (-110\n\nBucky Irving o76.5 rushing yards (-110 Jonnu Smith o48.5 receiving yards (-115)\n\nJonnu Smith o48.5 receiving yards (-115) Jonathan Taylor u6.5 receiving yards (-110)\n\nClick on each pick to see full analysis.\n\nNFL prop picks for Week 17\n\nBucky Irving Over 76.5 rushing yards\n\nAlthough Bucky Irving started the season as Rachaad White's backup, the rookie has made it clear who the head of the table is in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back room.\n\nEntering Week 17, Irving has emerged as the new RB1, averaging 5.2 yards per carry in December. He's set to take on a Carolina Panthers run defense that ranks dead-last against the run, surrendering a whopping 5.1 yards per carry.\n\nIrving saw 15 carries last week despite Tampa Bay trailing by double-digits early on, and a run-heavy game script should be in effect against a Panthers side that gave up 152 yards on 25 attempts to Irving back in Week 13.\n\nPick: Bucky Irving Over 76.5 rushing yards (-110 at bet365)\n\nPick made on 12-26\n\nJonnu Smith Over 48.5 receiving yards\n\nOne of 2024's biggest surprises has been the emergence of Jonnu Smith.\n\nAfter spending several seasons as a backup tight end for various teams, Smith has become one of the league\u2019s top receiving tight ends. Despite logging just a 29% snap share in Week 1, Smith has averaged 67.8% of field time over the past six games.\n\nSporting a career-high 802 receiving yards and tied for first on the Miami Dolphins in receptions, the 29-year-old has benefited from being Tua Tagovailoa's new security blanket.\n\nSmith has eclipsed 49.5 receiving yards in four of his last six starts and should be Tua\u2019s primary target on many plays against a Cleveland Browns defense that applies pressure on 41% of passing plays.\n\nThe Dolphins TE also benefits from contract incentives that will add $400,000 to his paycheck if he finishes with a snap share of 59% or more AND Miami finishes in the Top 20 in points scored and/or net yards, with an additional $400,000 if he reaches 65%. Pick: Jonnu Smith Over 48.5 receiving yards (-115 at SIA)\n\nPick made on 12-26\n\nJonathan Taylor Under 6.5 receiving yards\n\nJonathan Taylor made sure to erase all memory of his costly fumble against Denver in Week 15, tallying 218 rushing yards in the Indianapolis Colts' latest win over Tennessee.\n\nHowever, with a rushing O/U of 101.5 ahead of Sunday's matchup against the New York Giants, the value in JT's props market lies elsewhere.\n\nTaylor has quietly been a non-factor as a receiving back this season, ranking dead-last out of 49 qualified running backs in PFF receiver grade. The Colts star has just three catches on four targets over his last five games, including being shut out against the Titans and in Week 12 against Detroit.\n\nWith the Colts set to ground and pound the Giants to death and likely send out the combo of Trey Sermon and Tyler Goodson once things get ugly, I'm fading Taylor's receiving total on Sunday in the Meadowlands.\n\nPick: Jonathan Taylor Under 6.5 receiving yards (-110 at bet365)\n\nPick made on 12-26\n\nNFL Week 17 prop betting card\n\nBucky Irving o76.5 rushing yards (-110)\n\nJonnu Smith o48.5 receiving yards (-115)\n\nJonathan Taylor u6.5 receiving yards (-110)\n\nLast week: 5-0, +4.55 units\n\nSeason: 5-0, +4.55 units\n\nNot intended for use in MA.\n\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

            "article_content": "The end of the year typically brings with it an emotional look back at the days gone by. For archaeologists, looking back into the past is pretty much an every day thing. That said, here are 10 of the most interesting archeological findings that Popular Science covered this year.\n\nNeanderthals and early humans intermingled Europe earlier\n\nStone tools from the Lincombian\u2013Ranisian\u2013Jerzmanowician (LRJ) culture uncovered at Ranis. Item 1 is a partial bifacial blade point characteristic of the LRJ. Item 2 also contains finely made bifacial leaf points. CREDITL \u00a9 Josephine Schubert, Museum Burg Ranis.\n\nIn January, a new genetic analysis of bone fragments from an archaeological site in central Germany found that modern humans had reached northern Europe 45,000 years ago. This new timeline means that their arrival overlapped with the Neanderthals who had been living there for several thousand years before going extinct. It also bolsters the theory that the movement of modern humans into Europe and Asia about 50,000 years ago helped drive Neanderthals into extinction. The findings were described in three separate papers published in the journals Nature and Nature Ecology and Evolution.\n\nMysterious Iron Age burials\n\nThe skeletal remains of a frog and a human were uncovered at Seminario Vescovile in Verona, Italy. CREDIT: S.R. Thompson/SABAP-VR/Laffranchi et al., 2024\n\nA team of archeologists from Italy and Switzerland found that animals buried alongside humans might have been intended to be a meal or companion in the afterlife. They also may have been part of a complex funeral rite during the Iron Age, according to their study published in February in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nOf the 161 people buried at the Seminario Vescovile site in Verona, Italy, 16 were buried alongside animals. Four of the people at this site were buried alongside the remains of dogs and/or horses. These animals were not commonly eaten and the presence of horses and dogs was significant to the team. Earlier Iron Age findings in France and Switzerland indicate that horses and dogs were symbolic at the time and were often present in what appears to be sacrificial rituals, funeral rites, and are frequently associated with specific deities from the time. For the team on this study, the characteristics of a plot called Burial 46 were particularly interesting.\n\n\u201cIt includes the complete skeleton of a horse positioned above a woman, along with the cranium of a dog and the remains of additional horses,\u201d Marco Milella, a co-author of the new study and anthropologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told Popular Science. \u201cThis discovery provides a glimpse into a remarkably complex funerary ritual. While drawing scientifically robust conclusions from just two cases is challenging, we are prompted to consider whether this occurrence is merely coincidental or indicative of a deeper pattern.\u201d\n\nAncient Maya ballcourts were for more than games\n\n\n\nA decorative ring made from carved stone is embedded in the wall of a ballcourt in the ancient Maya city of Chichen Itza in present day Mexico. CREDIT: LanaCanada.\n\n\n\nAncient Mayans may have made ceremonial offerings during the construction of the ballcourts that they used for sporting events. Advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis helped a team of scientists detect evidence of several plants that are known for both medicinal and religious purposes. The team found evidence of four different plants that are associated with ancient Maya medicine and divination rituals.\n\nThese microscopic fragments of ancient plants were found beneath the floor of a Mayan ballcourt in present day Mexico and collecting them was likely purposeful. The findings were described in a study published in the journal PLOS One in April.\n\nThe ball courts in this study were used for several ball games, including pok-a-tok. This combination of soccer and basketball is also undergoing a present day revival. Players likely tried to get a ball through a ring in a hoop affixed to a wall. Ballcourts were considered significant places within cities and even built near some of the largest temples, including in ancient Maya cities like Tikal in Guatemala.\n\n[Related: Tooth powder unlocks clues to an 800-year-old mystery of man thrown into well.]\n\nDecoding the Norton Disney Dodecaheadron\n\nThe dodecahedron on display at the National Civil War Centre, Newark Museum. CREDIT: Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group.\n\nIn the spring, the largest known Roman dodecahedron went on display in England.The cast bronze object was uncovered in the village of Norton Disney in the Midlands of eastern England It is hollow at its middle and roughly the size of a clenched fist and has 12 flat faces are shaped like pentagons. At roughly three inches tall and weighing half a pound, it is one of the largest of these strange Roman objects ever discovered.\n\nThe dodecahedron was sitting among the ruins of a Roman pit and was likely placed there about 1,700 years ago. It was found \u201cin situ,\u201d or deliberately placed among 4th Century CE Roman pottery in some sort of hole or quarry. More archeological excavation is needed to clarify exactly what this pit was used for.\n\n\u201cRoman society was full of superstition, something experienced on a daily basis,\u201d the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group wrote in a statement. \u201cA potential link with local religious practice is our current working theory. More investigation is required though.\u201d\n\nArchaeology in space?\n\nA sample location in the starboard Maintenance Work Area of the International Space Station. The yellow dotted line indicates the boundaries of the sample area. CREDIT: NASA / ISSAP\n\nThe icy cold reaches of space is not exactly the first place to come to mind for archaeological discoveries. That didn\u2019t stop a team from California\u2019s Chapman University to see what they could find on the International Space Station (ISS). The team applied a traditional field strategy aboard the ISS for the first time. They applied the shovel test pit to analyze how the ever-changing \u201cmicrosociety\u201d aboard the ISS has adapted and changed over time.\n\nBack here on Earth, these projects typically involve digging small excavations at regular intervals across a site to gather information on how artifacts are distributed, then pick particularly promising pits for more thorough study. Since there really isn\u2019t anything to \u201cdig\u201d on the ISS, the team selected six locations throughout the space station and tasked astronauts to take daily photos of each space over roughly two months in 2022.\n\nTheir study published in August in the journal PLOS ONE identified 5,438 examples of \u201cartifacts\u201d including an augmented reality headset, Post-It notes, gloves, tools, and writing tools like Sharpie pens.

CREDIT: Professor Nick Pearce, Aberystwyth University, Picasa\n\nIn August, a new hypothesis for where Stonehenge\u2019s six-ton Altar Stone originated was published in the journal Nature. It likely originated 400 miles north in Scotland and not from Wales or other closer areas of southern England as scientists previously thought. This long trek points to the possibility that more advanced transportation methods and societal organization existed here about 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe Altar Stone is about 16 feet long and 19 inches thick and sits at the center of the circle. While it is not currently standing upright like the other stones, scientists are still uncertain if it stood vertically at some point. It arrived in the area sometime around 2,500 BCE, but its exact arrival date is still a mystery.\n\nChemical fingerprints within the grains matched rocks from northeast Scotland and were very different from Welsh bedrock. Specifically, with the age of the zircon minerals in the stone, the team is over 95 percent certain that it came all the way from northeastern Scotland.\n\nCheesy mummies\n\nTarim mummies from the present-day Xinjiang region of Northwestern China. CREDIT: Wenying Li\n\nAt least three embalmed bodies buried with some cheese on them were discovered at an ancient burial site in Xinjiang in northwestern China. The small lumps of fermented dairy, laid around the necks of the deceased, represent the longest-aged cheese ever discovered\u2013at roughly 3,500 years old.\n\nThe ancient cheese was incredibly well-preserved, but a new assessment of the chunks reveals some long-obsecured knowledge about human culture and a potential path for how dairy may have spread across Asia. The findings were published in the journal Cell in September.\n\nA new look at an Ancient Egyptian mummy\n\nLady Chenet-aa\u2019s mummy included artificial eyes to help her see in the afterlife. CREDIT: The Field Museum / Morgan Clark / Popular Science\n\nA team from Chicago\u2019s Field Museum used a CT scanner to determine Ancient Egyptian Lady Chenet-aa\u2019s burial procedure. Lady Chenet-aa lived roughly 3,000 years ago amid the 22nd Dynasty during Egypt\u2019s Third Intermediate Period. Soon after her death, one of the ways funerary experts prepared her for the afterlife was by constructing a cartonnage\u2014a paper mache-like box housing a deceased person\u2019s body.\n\nHowever, Chenet-aa\u2019s lacks any hint of a visible seam, leaving Egyptologists to wonder for years exactly how embalmers placed her inside the casing. Field Museum senior conservator JP Brown likened the mummy and its cartonnage coffin to a model ship inside a bottle.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly important that the inner coffin appeared whole and smooth without any external seams (unlike the outer coffin which was made of wood),\u201d Brown explained to Popular Science. \u201c\u2026 [and] if you look at the shape of cartonnage, the opening at the foot is too narrow for the mummy\u2019s shoulders to fit through.\u201d\n\nPompeii DNA tells a different story\n\nTwo of the plaster body casts from the Pompeii archaeological site. CREDIT: Archaeological Park of Pompei\n\nA new genetic analysis of 14 bodies recovered from Pompeii shed doubt on some of the initial interpretations of who these people were before the cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Using a new genomic analysis, a team of scientists found that their biological sexes and family relationships don\u2019t match up with the initial interpretations. The findings were published in November in the journal Current Biology.\n\nOne notable example is an adult wearing a golden bracelet found holding a child. This was traditionally interpreted to be a mother and child, but the new analysis found that it was an unrelated adult male and child. Additionally, a pair believed to be sisters or mother and daughter, included one genetic male.\n\n[Related: Focaccia likely originated in Mesopotamia, not Rome.]\n\nNeanderthals also loved to collect things\n\nThese marine fossils were found in a Neanderthal cave site, but aren\u2019t native to the area. CREDIT: Quaternary\n\nThe act of collecting objects may stretch at least as far back as our Neanderthal ancestry, according to relics uncovered in a cave in Iberia, Spain.\n\nAn archeological team analyzed 15 small marine fossils found in the fourth level of the Prado Vargas Cave system. While one artifact showed physical evidence of use as a hammer, the other 14 fossils displayed no obvious physical wear or utilitarian value. Additional evidence in the caves also points to the site serving as a semi-permanent Neanderthal encampment likely used for toolmaking, hunting, or perhaps even ritualistic activities.\n\nEarlier research shows Neanderthals engaged in cultural rituals such as ornamental crafting, cave wall art, and even familial and social funeral burials. Due to these rituals, experts argue that it stands to reason the human ancestors likely participated in pastimes such as collecting items they thought were interesting or special in some way.\n\nMaking clothes fit for the ice age\n\nMicro-CT scans of bone needle and needle specimens and the species they were compared with. CREDIT: Pelton et al., 2024, PLOS ONE\n\nIn November, a team in Wyoming proposed the idea that Paleolithic North Americans likely made needles using the bones of foxes, hares, rabbits, bobcats, mountain lions, lynx, and even the now-extinct American cheetah.\n\nBone needles like the ones from this study are common during this period in the North American archaeological record because sewing complex weather garments for freezing weather was a necessity in response to the cold climate shift brought on by the last ice age. There has been little direct evidence of such garments, but bone needles and the bones of the fur-bearing animals used to make pelts provide some indirect evidence of this early tailoring.\n\n\u201cThey were complex garments fringed with the furs of red fox, hare, and cat, some of which with feet still attached as is common among modern trappers,\u201d study co-author and Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton told Popular Science. \u201cThey were likely comparable to similar garments worn by the Inuit, able to withstand the cold and windy conditions of Wyoming\u2019s last Ice Age.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Scientists described numerous new species this past year, the world\u2019s smallest otter in India, a fanged hedgehog from Southeast Asia, tree-dwelling frogs in Madagascar, and a new family of African plants.\n\nExperts estimate that fewer than 20% of Earth\u2019s species have been documented by Western science, with potentially millions more awaiting discovery.\n\nAlthough species may be new to science, many are already known to local and Indigenous peoples and have traditional names and uses.\n\nUpon discovery, many new species are assessed as threatened with extinction, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts. See All Key Ideas\n\nA giant anaconda, a vampire hedgehog, a dwarf squirrel, and a tiger cat were among the new species named by science in 2024. Found from the depths of the Pacific Ocean to the mountaintops of Southeast Asia, each new species shows us that even our well-known world contains unexplored chambers of life.\n\nThis year, in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo Landscape alone, scientists uncovered 27 new-to-science species, including four new mammals, during a two month expedition. Meanwhile, the Greater Mekong region yielded 234 new species, and scientists from the California Academy of Sciences described 138 new species globally. The ocean depths continued to surprise, with more than 100 potentially new species found on an unexplored underwater mountain off Chile\u2019s coast. Two new mammal species were found in India this year, including the world\u2019s smallest otter.\n\nScientists estimate only a small fraction of Earth\u2019s species have been documented, perhaps 20% at best. Even among mammals, the best-known group of animals, scientists think we\u2019ve only found 80% of species. Yet most of the hidden species are likely bats, rodents, shrews, moles and hedgehogs.\n\nHowever, while species may be new to Western science, many have been well known to Indigenous peoples and local communities for generations. These communities often maintain sophisticated classification systems and deep ecological knowledge about species\u2019 behaviors, uses and roles in local ecosystems.\n\n\u201cFor example, the blob-headed fish, which is so bizarre and unusual, and scientists have never seen anything like it, but it\u2019s very familiar to the Awaj\u00fan,\u201d Trond Larsen, the leader of the Alto Mayo expedition in Peru from the NGO Conservation International, told Mongabay. \u201cThey regularly catch and eat them.\u201d Similarly, the ghost palm, newly named by scientists this year, has been used by Iban communities in Borneo for basketry and food for decades.\n\nUnfortunately, many species may be threatened with extinction before they\u2019re even formally named, victims of human activities like development and climate change. Some of these species could be foods or medicines for humans, but each has a unique role in Earth\u2019s interconnected web of life.\n\n\u201cThere is something immensely unethical and troubling about humans driving species extinct without ever even having appreciated their existence and given them consideration,\u201d Walter Jetz, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University, U.S., told Mongabay.\n\nHere\u2019s our look at some of the new-to-science species described in 2024:\n\nVampire hedgehog and glamorous viper among 243 new species from the Greater Mekong\n\nTrimeresurus ciliaris, a pit viper. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nHipposideros kingstonae, a leaf-nosed bat. Image \u00a9 Pipat Soisook.\n\nRhabdophis hmongorum, the H\u2019mong keelback snake. Image \u00a9 Luan Thanh Nguyen.\n\nZhangixalus melanoleucus, a tree frog found in northeast Laos. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nTrimeresurus uetzi, a pit viper found in Myanmar. Image \u00a9 H.T. Lalremsanga.\n\nChiloschista quangdangii, a leafless orchid found in the trade. Image \u00a9 Truong Ba Vuong.\n\nLaodracon carsticola, a karst dragon lizard was first spotted by a guide on a zipline tour in Laos. Image \u00a9 Santi Xayyasith.\n\nThe Greater Mekong region revealed some of the year\u2019s most distinctive species. Local nature enthusiasts and researchers documented a hedgehog species with fang-like teeth, leading to its name vampire hedgehog (Hylomys macarong).\n\nThey also described a pit viper (Trimeresurus ciliaris) whose scales create the appearance of dramatic eyelashes, and a karst dragon lizard (Laodracon carsticola) first noticed by a local tour guide.\n\nThese findings illuminate the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and conservation challenges, as many species face immediate threats from development and wildlife trafficking.\n\nNew giant anaconda species found on Waorani Indigenous land in Ecuador\n\nA significant discovery has been made in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where scientists have identified a new species of giant anaconda in the Bameno region of Baihuaeri Waorani Territory. During their research, the team encountered an impressive female specimen measuring 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) in length from head to tail, though local Indigenous communities report encountering even larger individuals. The species faces multiple threats throughout its range, from deforestation destroying their habitat to direct hunting by humans and environmental degradation from oil spills.\n\nTree-dwelling frogs found in Madagascar\u2019s pandan trees\n\nIn Madagascar\u2019s eastern rainforests, three frog species living in pandan trees received their first scientific descriptions. Known locally as sahona vakoa (pandan frogs), these amphibians complete their entire life cycle within the water-filled spaces between the plants\u2019 spiky leaves. The species, now given the scientific names Guibemantis rianasoa, G. vakoa and G. ambakoana, exemplify how local ecological knowledge often precedes formal scientific documentation by generations.\n\nA new underwater mountain hosts deep-sea wonders off Chile</\n\nAn expedition in the Southeast Pacific discovered more than 100 potentially new-to-science species on a previously unknown underwater mountain, including deep-sea corals (order Scleractinia), glass sponges, sea urchins (class Echinoidea), amphipods (order Amphipoda) and squat lobsters (family Galatheidae).\n\nThe expedition also sighted rare creatures like the flying spaghetti monster (Bathyphysa conifera) and Casper octopus (genus Grimpoteuthis).\n\nThe seamount, rising about 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) from the seafloor, about 1,450 km (900 mi) off Chile\u2019s coast, hosts thriving deep-sea ecosystems with ancient corals and glass sponges. The findings highlight the rich biodiversity of the high seas as the U.N. finalizes treaties to protect international waters.\n\nToothed toads emerge from mountain forests of Vietnam and China\n\nTwo new species of rare, toothed toads were discovered in Vietnam and China: the Mount Po Ma Lung toothed toad (Oreolalax adelphos) and the Yanyuan toothed toad (Oreolalax yanyuanensis). These amphibians are characterized by an unusual row of tiny teeth on the roof of their mouths. The discovery brings the total known toothed toad species to 21. However, more than half are already considered threatened due to habitat loss and degradation.\n\nDwarf squirrel and blobfish among 27 new species found in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo\n\nIn Peru\u2019s densely populated Alto Mayo region, home to 280,000 people, scientists working with local communities documented 27 species previously unknown to Western science.\n\nThe species included an amphibious mouse (Necromys aquaticus) found in just one patch of swamp forest; a fish with an unexplained blob-like head structure (Trichomycterus sp. nov.); an agile dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus sp. nov.); and a tree-climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa sp. nov.). These findings demonstrate how even human-modified landscapes can harbor biodiversity not yet documented by scientists.\n\nThe clouded tiger cat gains species status\n\nScientists formally described a new small wild cat species, the clouded tiger cat (Leopardus pardinoides), found in high-altitude cloud forests from Central to South America. This taxonomic clarification has major conservation implications, as new data indicate all three tiger cat species have experienced dramatic range reductions, with the clouded tiger cat\u2019s habitat particularly threatened by human activities.\n\nA rare ghost palm from Borneo\n\nThough long used by local Iban communities in western Borneo for basketry and edible shoots, scientists finally gave a formal name to a distinctive rattan palm after 90 years. Named Plectocomiopsis hantu (\u201chantu\u201d meaning ghost in Indonesian and Malay), the palm is known for its ghostly appearance, with white undersides to the leaves and gray stems. It\u2019s currently known from only three locations in or near protected rainforest habitats.\n\nA new family of African plants that can\u2019t photosynthesize\n\nScientists named an entirely new family of plants, Afrothismiaceae, which have evolved to take all their nutrients from fungal partners rather than through photosynthesis. Found in African forests, these rare plants only appear above ground to fruit and flower. Most species in this family are extremely rare or possibly extinct, with the majority recorded only once in Cameroon.\n\nNew orchids from Indonesia\n\nThe orchid family is immense, and new species are found most years. This year, researchers described five new species from islands throughout Indonesia. These are: Coelogyne albomarginata from Sumatra, Coelogyne spinifera from Seram, and Dendrobium cokronagoroi, the Dendrobium wanmae (a critically endangered species) and Mediocalcar gemma-coronae (endangered), all from western New Guinea.\n\nA lonely liana faces extinction from cement production in Vietnam\n\nA new genus and species of green-flowered liana, Chlorohiptage vietnamensis, was discovered in Vietnam but is already assessed as critically endangered. Its limestone karst habitat is being cleared for quarries to make cement, threatening the only known population of this unique plant.\n\nTwo new mammals from India\n\nTwo new mammal species in were described in Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, Northeast India\u2019s biggest national park. A forest officer documented the presence of the small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus), the world\u2019s tiniest otter species. The small-clawed otter, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, joins two other otter species already known to inhabit Kaziranga.\n\nThe binturong (Arctictis binturong), an elusive nocturnal tree-dweller also known as the bearcat, was photographed by tour guide Chirantanu Saikia in January 2024. The binturong is found exclusively in Northeast India and requires dense forest canopy for survival. It has become increasingly rare due to deforestation.\n\nWhile local residents had previously reported sightings of both species, these photographs provide the first concrete evidence of their presence in the park. Conservation officials believe these discoveries suggest the potential presence of other undocumented species within the park, highlighting the importance of continued wildlife surveys and protection efforts in the region.\n\nOne of the tiniest frogs ever found in Brazil\n\nScientists in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest described a remarkable new species of frog, Brachycephalus dacnis, measuring just 6.95 millimeters in length \u2013 about the size of a pencil eraser. Unlike other similarly tiny frogs that often struggle with balance, this species has maintained its inner ear structure, allowing it to jump gracefully up to 32 times its body length. The discovery in S\u00e3o Paulo state\u2019s remaining Atlantic Forest highlights both the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and the urgent need for conservation, as this critically threatened ecosystem now stands at just 13% of its original extent, potentially harboring many more undiscovered species.\n\nBanner image of Leopardus pardinoides, or the clouded tiger cat, as a new species.

            "article_content": "Decades after a childhood classmate licked her skin to see if it was chocolatey, an Aurora-based consultant launched an app this fall so people with questions about those unlike them can find answers.\n\n\u201cIn first grade, a little boy licked my arm to see if I tasted like chocolate,\u201d said Sonia Stovall, a consultant based in Aurora, who used experiences like that to fuel her new app, \u201cNo Offense.\u201d She launched it in September and so far has three dozen subscribers.\n\nThe app \u2013 which has some free content as well as subscription tiers for about $30 a month \u2013 gets new content regularly as Stovall comes across people whose lived experiences might answer questions app users have.\n\nTo give an example of how the app works, Stovall, a chatty, open woman who is Black, explained how she\u2019ll use the lived experience of a person who uses a wheelchair to provide information to app users, in a way that keeps the user from having to ask what could be interpreted as an offensive question, while also protecting the subject of the question from having to be put on the spot with a conversation that could be triggering.\n\n\u201cJason is a quadriplegic who became that way after a cycling accident, but he still does cycling marathons, just in his [motorized] chair,\u201d said Stovall, 51, of an interviewee whose story will be available on the app.\n\nSonia Stovall Sonia Stovall launched the \"No Offense\" app this fall.\n\nShe said the goal of that segment would be to help people not using chairs understand Jason\u2019s day-to-day lived experiences and motivate them away from using handicap parking spots.\n\n\u201cBy seeing what it takes for him to get ready for the day, go through a day, the way that his car has been set up, helps you understand . . . \u2018Okay, this little 10 minutes for me is quick to me, but throws off his day by 45 minutes if he's not able to find a spot,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nCapturing stories from the people living them \u2013 like Jason \u2013 is what Stovall thinks will work best.\n\n\u201cI feel that in order to get through the manufactured divisions that are being created in our society, bridging gaps through stories is the best way to do it,\u201d she said.\n\nSuch stories will go in the \u201cLived Experiences\u201d part of the app, available to paid subscribers. To populate it with content, she reaches out to people she comes across and interviews them, as she did recently in the Centennial home of Jenny Lerner, 62, an Ashkenazi Jewish woman from Colombia.\n\nIn Lerner\u2019s kitchen, Stovall sets up her recording equipment and ring light, using Lerner\u2019s utensils jug to steady it. Stovall chose Lerner to show the range of people who self-define as Jewish.\n\n\u201cSo we were talking about how your family ended up in Colombia\u2026\u201d she began. Lerner, who has ringlets of curly hair and a melodic Spanish accent, responded willingly, explaining, \u201cSo they went from Poland to Israel, Israel to Peru\u2026\u201d and then to Colombia.\n\nStovall kept the conversation going with gentle questions: \u201cIt sounds like a large part of your family wasn't able to get out of Poland before it was invaded and they died in concentration camps?\u201d\n\nLerner replied, \u201cMany of my family that have moved to Colombia later on moved to Israel . . . The second generation decided to move back to there. So that's why most [of] my family now live in Israel. They moved to Israel, but not my parents. My parents continue living in Colombia all the time. But the cousins and the uncles and the brothers, a lot of them moved to Israel . . .\u201d\n\nOf her two daughters, Lerner said, \u201cI mean they feel that they are Jewish, but at the same time, South Americans \u2013 they also, they feel Colombian, totally Colombian.\u201d\n\nTo that, Stovall said, \u201cSo they are a combination of both because that's where you end up, right? You're not one thing or another. You become a mixture of things.\u201d\n\nIfeoluwapo Oludare Self-taught no-code platform developer Ifeoluwapo Oludare, 24, worked with Sonia Stovall on the technical aspects of the app from Nigeria.\n\nOnce Stovall edits the interview, she said, she\u2019ll add it to the app. Although she gained a basic knowledge of app development, to handle technical aspects outside her range of expertise, she looked for help through an online freelancing marketplace. Self-taught no-code platform developer Ifeoluwapo Oludare, 24, got the job.\n\n\u201cI was in charge of making sure that everything was in sync,\u201d said Oludare in a virtual interview from his co-working space in Nigeria. \u201cAnd also making sure that we get it published and live on both the Apple store and Google store as well. We worked over a couple of weeks and I logged . . over a hundred hours, for about 40 hours per week,\u201d he said.\n\nStovall said the idea for the app came to her many years after the arm-licking of her grade-school days in Nebraska, where she grew up.\n\n\u201c\u2018No Offense\u2019 came to me after I had a date with [a white man], and this person was writing an article about Black women and their hair,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, he hadn't interviewed any Black women for the article. And he himself was not a Black person. He was not married to a Black woman. And so I asked him some questions on how he felt qualified to basically take whatever experiences he'd ever had with Black women and translate them into this article. One of the things that he stated was that sometimes it is better for these things \u2013 meaning factoids or concepts about people of different cultures \u2013 to come from someone who is white-appearing or white-adjacent or something to that effect. And honestly, it made me so angry because I thought, \u2018Why are you translating for us to white?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe had a revelation about how she could change things: \u201cWithin about 24 hours, I woke up at two o'clock in the morning and I thought, \u2018There needs to be a place where people can learn on their own.\u2019\u201d She said she looked for a similar app but wasn\u2019t able to find one.\n\nThe title of the app relates to how some people form questions (i.e. \u201cNo offense, but why do you wrap your head every day?\u201d) that the app can answer. Its logo is an Adinkra symbol, which is a visual symbol that represents concepts and proverbs; they come from Ghana and the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The one she selected was intentional.\n\n\u201cIt is a knot without a beginning or an end that symbolizes reconciliation, peace and forgiveness,\u201d Stovall said in an email.\n\nSonia Stovall Sonia Stovall selected an Andinkra symbol as the logo for the \"No Offense\" application she created this fall. The symbol she chose is called Mpatapo; \"It is a knot without a beginning or an end that symbolizes reconciliation, peace and forgiveness,\" she said. Andinkra symbols come from Ghana and the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and are visual images that represent concepts and ideas.\n\nWhen asked how she decides what goes behind the pay wall, she said: \u201cSometimes it depends on the amount of time, the amount of work that it takes. And then I have to edit and put it together. . . there are legal aspects and all of those things that I take care of. And if I were to pay someone to do those things, it would be very expensive. But because I have some of that experience myself and I can do it and . . . I have access and they're willing to share that access, I think that that's worth some coins.\u201d\n\nThe access Stovall has to a wide range of people comes from her intentional community-building with people she meets through day-to-day life living in the United States. It\u2019s an experience her app developer, Oludare in Nigeria, said doesn\u2019t resonate for him.\n\n\u201cWell, on this side of the world, I wouldn't say we have that kind of stuff around here because basically it is just one race and we don't really have that kind of bias, basically. So I don't think we'll have need for something like that,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Stovall finds a need and related stories wherever she goes, and has plans to continue collecting content to fill categories on her app like \u201cAsk Me Anything,\u201d where people present Stovall with a question or situation they don\u2019t know how to handle, and Stovall finds an answer.\n\n\u201cAs I do more workshops and things like that, I meet more people,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I recently met someone; she's an Indonesian immigrant and her daughter is deaf, and they recently made the decision to get cochlear implants for her daughter. And they're receiving a lot of backlash from their deaf community who feel that they're turning their back on their community.\u201d\n\nThat story will soon be a part of the app \u2013 for the same reason the other stories are there: \u201cThis will just help people to start talking and ask those questions or ask them on the app, but also instead of finding someone to ask, then you can just access \u2018Lived Experiences\u2019 and see what that's like.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Whether you\u2019re a professional event planner, putting together an important conference for work, or just throwing a big party, event planning templates can help you stay organized. From tracking costs to vendor contact information and guest RSVPs, the right system can ensure everything goes according to plan while saving your sanity along the way.\n\nmonday.com: An event planning dashboard for managing multiple events, projects, and employees\n\nPlanning an event is a lot like managing a project, especially if you\u2019re juggling multiple events alongside other projects and a team at the same time. Since monday.com is one of the best project management solutions on the market today, it\u2019s perfect for managing all three within the same platform.\n\nIt comes with everything you need (and then some) to stay organized, plus there\u2019s a free plan for up to two users if you want to try it before upgrading to a paid plan.\n\nMore on monday.com: monday.com Review | monday.com vs Wrike | monday.com vs. Pipedrive.\n\nAside from being able to handle just about any type of project or item you need to keep track of, my favorite part of this event planning template is the built-in budget tracking features.\n\nIt allows you to set a budget for an entire quarter or year and allocate that money across all of your events. Alternatively, you can set a unique budget for each event, and track spending by category.\n\nRegardless of how you approach this, you can keep an eye on your numbers and ensure you stay within your budget constraints.\n\nI also like that monday.com helps you streamline the RSVP process. You can easily send out an RSVP form to automatically track attendees without having to deal with manual inputs that are time-consuming and prone to human error.\n\nEach RSVP will show up in your system with all the details the user provided.\n\nClickUp: Event planning templates for collaborative teams\n\nClickUp\u2019s project management system is built for collaboration out of the box, including team chat, document building, nested comment threads, and more. This makes it a great option for teams planning events together. ClickUp also makes it easy to track progress and understand everyone\u2019s responsibilities.\n\nYou can get started with ClickUp for free and work with an unlimited number of users at no cost. However, most teams will get the most out of it by upgrading to a paid plan.\n\nMore on ClickUp: ClickUp Review | ClickUp vs Asana | ClickUp vs Notion.\n\nTemplate 1: Best for delegating responsibilities and tracking priorities\n\nThis first ClickUp event planning template works well for small-to-mid-sized events. I think it safely supports events with up to 250 participants, and it works equally well for smaller events with 50 to 100-person guest lists.\n\nYour entire team can use this to align event resources, visualize what needs to happen, and ensure everything gets done on time and under budget.\n\nThe default template comes with six views, including lists, calendars, and more. My favorite part is that you can set priority levels once and use color coded flags to visually understand priority in any view at a glance.\n\nOn top of that, there\u2019s a separate prioritization board that groups everything by priority.\n\nYou can easily drag and drop tasks to different sections to ensure your team\u2019s always working on what\u2019s most important.\n\nClickUp\u2019s built in commenting and mentions feature lets you alert the assignee of priority changes so everyone\u2019s always in the loop. Users can look at all of their assigned work, sort it by priority, and work down their list.\n\nThis alone can help you avoid repetitive meetings since everything\u2019s easily visible.\n\nI also like that project or event managers can look at each person\u2019s workload and rebalance everything as needed by dragging tasks to someone else.\n\nTemplate 2: Best for large corporate events and conferences\n\nIf you need to plan and host larger events, like conferences or corporate offsites, you\u2019ll need something with a bit more power. This second ClickUp template offers just that \u2014 it\u2019s more advanced than the first and takes a bit more time to set up, but it\u2019s worth it for complex vents that have a lot of moving parts.\n\nIt works particularly well if you have sponsors, exhibitors, guests, and a lot of different elements you need to stay on top of.\n\nThe best part is that it comes with a pre-built expense intake form, allowing your team to track their expenses towards your budget. Each expense can be categorized, so it works just as well for reimbursements too.\n\nYou could even set up a separate form for sponsors, guests, or vendors if you need to gather additional information from them.\n\nThe sponsor area lets you group them by tier (if you\u2019d like). For example, you could have different statuses based on donation amounts. You can also keep track of payments and donations, their attendance at your event, and even various activities to fulfill sponsor promises.\n\nFor RSVPs, there\u2019s a robust registration tracker set up for managing different types of tickets. You can simplify if you don\u2019t need all that, but it\u2019s nice to have it already built out.\n\nAnother standout feature of this template is that it can help you gather feedback after the event is over.\n\nWrike: An event planning template for ongoing internal events\n\nWrike is a highly structured project management tool that accommodates teams of all sizes. Unlike other project management platforms that restrict the number of users on the free tier, Wrike\u2019s free plan lets you onboard as many users as you\u2019d like.\n\nIt also has a range of built in views that can help manage recurring events plus all the work required to make them happen.\n\nMore on Wrike: Wrike Review | Wrike vs Smartsheet | Wrike vs Asana.\n\nWhether you\u2019re managing regular conferences, product launches, or informal parties, this template makes it easy to visualize everything and stay on top of every task required to set up each event.\n\nEach event can have its own owner, due date, priority, and tasks. Drilling down one level further, each task can also have its own assignee, status, and more.\n\nYou can plan events across your entire company in one place or break them up into multiple projects or workspaces.\n\nEach workspace can be rolled up to a higher level view, making it great for managers that need to see all the work in one place. Plus, you can use the template\u2019s built in scheduling system and request forms to track attendance.\n\nMy favorite element is that you can map everyone on a Gantt chart with dependencies. However, you have to be on a paid plan to use Gantt charts in Wrike.\n\nTeamwork: An event planner for marketers\n\nTeamwork is a robust project management system for client-based businesses. It can also work well for other types of models, but it\u2019s purpose built for agencies and freelancers.\n\nIt has all the typical project and task management features you expect plus things like retainer management, resource scheduling, built in invoicing, time tracking, customizable client views, and proofing workflows.\n\nThere\u2019s a free plan for up to five people if you want to try it out, but most businesses will need to upgrade to a paid plan.\n\nMore on Teamwork: Teamwork Review | Teamwork vs monday.com | Teamwork Alternatives.\n\nMy favorite event planning template for Teamwork is specifically for marketers who need to organize and promote events. You\u2019ll be able to plan ahead, keep track of all the work involved, and manage all the moving parts in one place.\n\nWhether you need to build an email campaign, event landing page, finalize your vendor list, this template has everything you need to stay organized and reach more of the right people.\n\nAnother standout feature is the ability to create reusable workflows you can copy to a new project in a few clicks.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out the best way to promote your events, you can easily replicate it without having to add all the tasks and assignees from scratch. It can be a huge time saver, especially if you use it to plan recurring events or a lot of short events back to back.\n\nIf you like Teamwork but you\u2019re not a marketer, this template can easily be adapted to other departments as well.\n\nCheck out our curated list of the best free marketing plan templates if you\u2019re looking for something broader that will help you develop a general marketing plan.\n\nNotion: A personal party planning template\n\nNotion is an online productivity platform that brings tables, spreadsheets, documents, and collaborative elements together. It starts as a blank slate and lets you create a personalized workspace that matches your needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re using it by yourself, you can use the free plan without having to upgrade for a long time, making it perfect for planning personal parties.\n\nMore on Notion: Notion Review | Notion vs Asana | Notion vs OneNote.\n\nSolo planners don\u2019t need all the bells and whistles that come with all the project management tools we\u2019ve covered so far. This template, on the other hand, is simple and designed for personal use.\n\nIt\u2019s great if you\u2019re planning something and don\u2019t want any of the details to slip through the cracks.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to add all your action items, keep track of who\u2019s bringing what, and even assign tasks to other people. But the best part is that you can publish your workspace for free \u2014 this makes it visible to anyone who has the link, so you can use it as a digital invitation.\n\nAttendees will be able to RSVP, mention any extra guests, sign up to bring items, let you know about food allergies, or any other details you might need from them.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a simple way to make sure your next party goes off without a hitch.\n\nFree event planning templates for Excel\n\nIf you\u2019re an individual or a small team planning a one-off event, you probably don\u2019t need project management software. A spreadsheet will be more than enough, especially if you have a template to help you get started.\n\nWhether you\u2019re planning a baby shower, family reunion, or a holiday party at work, Excel or Google Sheets plus a group chat or email thread is often all you need.\n\nTemplate 1: A detailed event planning checklist for Excel\n\nTeamGantt is great for building Gantt charts, but it also offers a ton of free templates for Excel and Google Sheets. One of the best event planning templates is a pre-made checklist covering dozens of different elements you may need to keep track of.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to add your own tasks or edit the existing tasks to match your needs.\n\nRather than using a standard status drop down, you\u2019ll be able to set percentages that reflect each task\u2019s progress. It then calculates the overall percentage for each category.\n\nEach task can have its own start and end date, assignee, estimated hours, and actual hours so you can compare.\n\nAlthough this template is simple, a straightforward checklist is often all you need.\n\nIt\u2019s also available for use in TeamGantt if you want more robust visualization and tracking capabilities. With a paid plan, you\u2019ll be able to build out Gantt charts, set up notifications, and collaborate with a team using a similar setup.\n\nTemplate 2: A simple event calendar for small businesses\n\nKnack is a no-code application builder that also offers free small business templates for Excel and Google Sheets. One of their best templates is a simple event planner that\u2019s perfect for sharing a company wide calendar.\n\nRather than planning all the work that needs to happen before, during, and after an event, this template is a simple calendar that lets you and your team add events as needed.\n\nIt can work well for individuals or small teams who need an easy way to keep track of upcoming events. Whether you\u2019re organizing book signings and author readings, art classes for kids, live shows, or special discounts, it\u2019s incredibly easy to use.\n\nThere\u2019s a separate tab for each month and you can create additional copies to continue using it year after year.\n\nAny time someone needs to book an event, they can check the calendar to see when there\u2019s an open date. They\u2019ll also be able to add theirs so nobody else takes it.\n\nWhen to use an event planning template\n\nIf you\u2019re planning an event and you need something more organized than a simple to-do list in your phone, an event planning template can help ensure everything is done on time.\n\nHere are a few scenarios where a template can definitely help:\n\nAn event with more than 50 guests.\n\nRecurring events or multiple events at the same time.\n\nComplex logistics (like vendors, exhibitors, and sponsors).\n\nAttendees will RSVP and potentially add extra guests.\n\nYour event is longer than a few hours.\n\nCollaboration with others is required.\n\nYou need to track expenses.\n\nNot sure if you should use one? Create a list of everything you need to get done. If you still feel overwhelmed, a template can help you get even more organized until you feel confident everything is accounted for.\n\nTemplates, project management tools, and productivity platforms also offer other benefits, like automations, notifications, and analytics.\n\nYou won\u2019t get these from a spreadsheet or note on your phone. If you need or want any of those things, upgrading to something more powerful and using one of the templates in this guide will give you access to more features.\n\nHow to choose the right event planning template\n\nJust like events come in all flavors, templates for planning them do too. Some let you plan all the work involved, others are a simple calendar to let others know when events are taking place, and most are somewhere in between.\n\nIn most cases, you can use any of the templates here. It really won\u2019t matter which one you use because you\u2019ll be able to customize it to match your needs.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s a good idea to start with a template that\u2019s close if you don\u2019t want to do a lot of tweaking to make it work.\n\nThe following considerations can help you narrow it down:\n\nSolo vs collaborative events \u2014 Some templates are clearly meant for individuals, while others offer more functionality for working with a team.\n\n\u2014 Some templates are clearly meant for individuals, while others offer more functionality for working with a team. One-off vs ongoing needs \u2014 Planning one event is a lot easier than planning recurring events or multiple events at the same time. As such, templates for one-off events tend to be simple and straightforward while others are more complex.\n\n\u2014 Planning one event is a lot easier than planning recurring events or multiple events at the same time. As such, templates for one-off events tend to be simple and straightforward while others are more complex. Number of guests \u2014 Events with 25 guests, 250 guests, and 2,500 guests require very different levels of planning and coordination.\n\n\u2014 Events with 25 guests, 250 guests, and 2,500 guests require very different levels of planning and coordination.

Not every event planning template offers this feature out of the box.\n\n\u2014 Do you need or want to track expenses against your budget? Not every event planning template offers this feature out of the box. Timeline \u2014 You can use something simple, like a spreadsheet if you\u2019re planning an event that\u2019s in the next couple of weeks, whereas you\u2019ll need something more advanced for planning an event that\u2019s 3-6+ months away. The same is true for planning an event that lasts a few hours vs planning one that spans multiple days or weeks.\n\n\u2014 You can use something simple, like a spreadsheet if you\u2019re planning an event that\u2019s in the next couple of weeks, whereas you\u2019ll need something more advanced for planning an event that\u2019s 3-6+ months away.

            "article_content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nWhy it matters: Devices like smartphones rely on a fragmented array of CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, DSPs, and other accelerators to handle various tasks. However, these specialized cores often remain idle, leading to wasted power and silicon area. A startup aims to tackle this inefficiency with a unified design it aptly calls the \"Universal Processor.\"\n\nUbitium claims to be developing a groundbreaking processor architecture capable of handling virtually any workload.\n\nAt the heart of this innovation is a \"workload-agnostic microarchitecture\" built on the open-source RISC-V instruction set. Unlike traditional chips with specialized cores dedicated to specific tasks, the Universal Processor's transistors can be dynamically repurposed to handle a wide range of computing workloads, including simple control logic, general computing, AI, and graphics rendering.\n\nThe startup is comprised of veterans from companies like Intel, Nvidia, and Texas Instruments. The key inventor, Martin Vorbach, holds over 200 patents licensed by major chipmakers. However, as Tom's Hardware points out, turning this concept into a fully functional product is a massive challenge in itself.\n\nSo far, Ubitium has raised only $3.7 million to move the Universal Processor from the drawing board to working prototypes. This is a small amount for cutting-edge chip development, which can easily run into the hundreds of millions.\n\nYet, the startup is aiming to deliver its first real Universal Processor chips by 2026. As a result, some are understandably skeptical that such an ambitious startup can deliver a \"breakthrough\" new architecture on such an aggressive timeline.\n\nUbitium doesn't just envision a single Universal Processor; they're aiming to build an entire lineup, ranging from tiny embedded devices to high-performance computing systems that could potentially compete with the largest chips from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.\n\nThe potential upsides are tantalizing. For one, Ubitium claims its Universal Processor can deliver 10 to 100 times better performance per cost compared to today's dedicated chips.\n\n\"As we reuse the same transistors for various workloads, replacing an array of chips and reducing complexity, we lower the overall cost of the system. Depending on the baseline, this is a performance/cost ratio of 10x to 100x\u2026The reuse of transistors for different workloads drastically reduces the overall transistor count in the processor \u2013 further saving energy and silicon area,\" Ubitium CEO Hyun Shin Cho told Venture Beat.\n\nCho added that their creation isn't an incremental improvement, but rather a \"total paradigm shift\" for microprocessors."

            "article_content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe generative AI landscape has morphed into a high-stakes battleground in 2024, with an army of upstarts storming the castle once ruled by OpenAI.\n\nEveryone and their tech-savvy grandma seems to be vying for a piece of the AI pie, cooking up language models, agentic AIs, image generators, and even an AI meme coin shiller or two.\n\nThe benchmarks are changing faster than our human ability to keep up. Barely a week goes by without some shiny new toy hitting the market\u2014an updated LLM here, a turbocharged image generator there, or a next-gen AI flexing some exotic training technique.\n\nBut here at Decrypt, we've rolled up our sleeves and tried them all.\n\nWe've kicked the tires, pushed the buttons, and gotten deep inside the inner workings and the outputs provided by the most popular AI models\u2014and some that are not so well-known.\n\nNow that it's clear that OpenAI isn't the only sheriff in town, we've compiled a list of the cream of the crop\u2014the generative AI models that have wowed us, befuddled us, and occasionally made us spit out our coffee.\n\nChatbots\n\nA chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users. It uses natural language processing and artificial intelligence to understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses. Usually, people confuse chatbots with LLMs, or large language models.\n\nToday, chatbots are a bit more complex, with capabilities that extend beyond text generation. They can now browse the web, generate and understand images, talk to the user, etc.\n\nHere is our list of the best chatbots you should try:\n\nGold medal: OpenAI's ChatGPT\n\nChatGPT offers a wide array of features at $20/month, including custom agent creation with natural language, a clean interface, web search, and multiple models (reasoning, writing, vision, voice, and image generation).\n\nSilver medal: Anthropic's Claude\n\nA superior LLM with an intuitive UI featuring split-screen artifacts for reasoning and code generation, Claude supports million-token context and custom agents. However, it lacks web search and image generation and often faces capacity issues, forcing users to switch to a weaker model or generate \u201cconcise\u201d shorter answers. Because of this, it cannot be the best just yet.\n\nBronze medal: Mistral AI\u2019s LeChat\n\nThis free platform is powered by Mistral Large, featuring top-tier Flux image generation and superior web search\u2014the best, in our opinion, even beating SearchGPT. It supports document/image understanding and open-source AI agents, though text quality trails competitors. However, the Mistral Large LLM isn\u2019t as strong as its competitors, making it ideal for power users willing to trade text quality for features.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Meta AI, Gemini (from Google\u2019s AI studio, not the main site), Hugging Chat, Reka, Grok-2\n\nLarge language models\n\nA large language model or LLM is an artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. You can see it as a glorified autocomplete. They are designed to predict what the most likely token (think about words, though it\u2019s an inaccurate comparison) is in a group.\n\nThe result is natural text that feels human because, well, it resembles what humans would do.\n\nHere is our list of the best LLMs to date:\n\nBest generalist: OpenAI's GPT-4o\n\nBalances creative writing, coding, and reasoning with a customizable \"Canvas\" feature, though its style can feel predictable. The latest version (from November 20) has also achieved the top spot in the LLM Arena with an ELO score of 1,366, beating an experimental version of Google Gemini released on November 21.\n\nBest for writing: Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n\nMatches or exceeds GPT-4o in many areas with more creative, human-like output, though it's prone to hallucination.\n\nBest for storytelling: Longwriter\n\nGenerates 10,000+ word stories within minutes. Do we need to say more?\n\nMost versatile: Meta's Llama-3.1\n\nThe leading open-source model with extensive customization, LoRA creation, and fine-tuning options, available in sizes from 7 billion to 405 billion parameters so users can run it on their local machines or cloud servers depending on their needs. Nvidia developed a customized version named \"Nemotron,\" which made some waves in the community and is worth checking out.\n\nBiggest letdown: Reflection Llama-3.1 70B\n\nAnnounced with high expectations, the model claimed to beat GPT-4o thanks to its embedded Chain of Thought. It ended up being a major fiasco with fake benchmarks, hidden API calls to Claude AI, and a major controversy.\n\nImage generators\n\nAn image generator is essentially a model that gets a text input and provides an output associated with that text input. So, for example, you say, \u201cGreen horse with a dragon face,\u201d and the model will generate a photo of a green horse with a dragon face. You can also input something like \u201cbusty waifu,\u201d but that is not what they are for.\n\nThese are some of the best image generators currently available\n\nBest generalist: Flux\n\nFlux dominates the latest generation of AI models with substantial customization, LoRA/ControlNet support, and text generation capabilities. It requires powerful hardware, but shows a characteristic style with extreme bokeh and slack skin detail that users are still trying to tackle.\n\nIt comes in three flavors: Pro (closed-source, the most potent model), Dev (noncommercial license), and Schnell (an open-source, distilled version). All three offer excellent image generation capabilities, and the ceiling will go higher if fine-tunes are considered.\n\nBest for realism: Recraft v3\n\nDelivers unmatched realism, offering versatile presets and better value than proprietary alternatives like MidJourney.\n\nIt has a free tier that offers the same quality\u2014though Recraft owns generations.\n\nBest for anime: MidJourney Niji\n\nUnrivaled quality for anime-style images; a Stable Diffusion fine-tuning is a secondary option.\n\nMost versatile: Stable Diffusion 3.5\n\nStable Diffusion 3.5 is a major improvement over SD3 with better licensing, detailed output, and add-on support.\n\nIt is more resource-efficient than Flux for fine-tuning and is a full model\u2014unlike Flux Schnell, which is a distilled version\u2014making it the best pick for custom models.\n\nHowever, it came out a little bit late and has been overshadowed by Flux\u2019s popularity.\n\nBiggest Letdown: SD 3 Medium\n\nEveryone expected this new model to be the new King of Image Generators, beating SDXL and every other model. It ended up being a poor model, infamous for its horrible license and horrific aberrations when trying to generate people on grass.\n\nVideo generators\n\nVideo generators take image generation one step further. They generate each frame and use it as input to generate the following one with image consistency and high prompt adherence.\n\nThis is still a work in progress, and models can only generate a few seconds of video. Below is a list of some of the best ones you can try.\n\nBest generalist: Kling\n\nRapidly improving the Chinese model, outperforming Sora in some cases. Supports face model training, and consistently generates high-quality scenes showing a major versatility in terms of styles, realism, and camera movement.\n\nBest contender: Runway Gen 3\n\nPioneering generative video app with solid environmental understanding, but struggles with fast-paced scenes.\n\nBest for storytelling: ShowRunner\n\nWe cannot tell you a lot about this one. However, in confidential testing, it has shown immense potential.\n\nBest open-source: Genmo Mochi 1\n\nIt's a great release that beats competitors like Rhymes Allegro and Stable Video Diffusion with superior realism and frame consistency.\n\nBiggest letdown: OpenAI Sora\n\nAnnounced with high expectations as a revolutionary \u201cworld model\u201d beyond any video generation, it remains unavailable today with underwhelming leaked outputs.\n\nHonorable mention: Google Veo\n\nGoogle's Veo was released on December 3. We haven't tested it, but the generations shared by Google look pretty nice. Of course, we're on the waiting list to test the model, and you'll be the first to know our thoughts as soon as we get access.\n\nMusic generators\n\nJust like video generators, music generators create songs. It\u2019s different from audio generators, however, since the outputs are more specialized to melodic outputs that are not noise, plain voices, or audio effects.\n\nUsers can rely on a separate LLM to generate the lyrics of a song or input lyrics manually, and set a few parameters like the style of the song, and then the model will output relevant music from scratch.\n\nThese are the best two\u2014plus an open-source alternative.\n\nBest generalist: Suno v4\n\nExcels in vocals and lyrics, style diversity, and long-form consistency. Its predecessor, Suno v3.5, is not free but remains a strong alternative.\n\nBest contender: Udio\n\nSuno\u2019s biggest rival. It delivers impressive composition accuracy, nearly rivaling Suno v4 in vocals. Some generations surpass Suno v3 in subjective style.\n\nBest open-source: Stable Audio 2\n\nThe open-source scene is not doing a lot in this area. Stable Audio 2 seems to be the best model, but lags behind closed-source competitors in every field. Meta\u2019s AudioCraft and MusicGen are alternatives, but far from industry-leading. Fine-tuners have not paid attention, and usually, they are the people behind the cherry on top that makes open-source models so great.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

Initiatives in terms of quality, innovation and wider global reach will help the Indian pharma sector to realise the potential,\" according to Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) Secretary General Sudarshan Jain.\n\nGiven the conducive policies and the advantage of demographic and digital talent, India will play a pivotal role in advancing global health for all in years to come, he added.\n\nIPA represents 23 leading research-based Indian pharmaceutical companies like Sun Pharma, Cipla, and Dr Reddy's Laboratories, among others.\n\nJain said innovation will continue to be a major focus for the industry going forward.\n\nHe noted that the government is expected to soon announce the operational details of the Promotion of Research & Innovation Programme which would also spur innovation.\n\nElaborating on the initiatives lined up in the private sector, he said that leading companies are increasing their focus on specialty portfolios and diversifying into higher-value drugs.\n\n\"Additionally, the industry is set to make notable progress in areas such as CAR-T cell therapy, mRNA vaccines, and the development of complex molecules, which hold immense potential for driving future growth,\" Jain said.\n\nBesides, the patent expiries of blockbuster biologics by 2025 present a significant growth avenue in the global biosimilars market, he stated.\n\nSimilarly, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) Director General Anil Matai said the industry is set for a profound transformation in 2025.\n\nTechnological advancements like AI, machine learning and precision medicine are set to revolutionise drug discovery, manufacturing and patient care, he said.\n\nOPPI represents research-based pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Novartis and Merck, in India.\n\nBesides, strengthened regulatory frameworks will enable the swift adoption of innovative therapies while prioritising patient safety, Matai said.\n\n\"A focus on research excellence and innovation will position India as a global hub for high-quality, affordable pharmaceuticals. Collaboration between policymakers, academia and industry stakeholders will address unmet medical needs, particularly in underserved regions,\" he stated.\n\nAlso, adherence to Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) will uphold ethical standards, fostering trust and transparency across the healthcare ecosystem, Matai stated.\n\nReflecting on the year gone by, Jain said 2024 has been a year of building on a robust foundation with sustainable growth and thrust on simplifying regulations and harmonisation with global standards.\n\nThe PLI (production linked incentive) schemes have started seeing dividends with the launch of greenfield projects for the production of Penicillin G and Clavulanic acid, among others.\n\nMatai noted that the notification of the Patent (Amendment) Rules 2024, waivers for Phase 3 clinical trials for certain categories of drugs already approved in well-regulated markets, and the much-awaited Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) with European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states reflect India's progressive strides toward creating a dynamic, globally competitive pharmaceutical sector that is driven by innovation.\n\nCommenting on the healthcare segment, Fortis Healthcare MD & CEO Ashutosh Raghuvanshi said that the hospital market is projected to grow from nearly USD 99 billion in 2023 to an estimated USD 194 billion by 2032.\n\n\"Our sector is not only expanding but evolving to meet the diverse needs of our population. This year has been particularly significant as hospitals have emerged as the leading recipients of foreign direct investment within the healthcare landscape,\" he added.\n\nLooking ahead, the industry must focus on several key trends that will shape the future of healthcare in India, Raghuvanshi said.\n\n\"The ageing population will drive demand for specialised geriatric care, while a growing emphasis on preventive care will shift our focus from merely treating illness to promoting wellness,\" he stated.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and telemedicine will enhance diagnostic precision and operational efficiency, ultimately improving patient outcomes, he added.\n\nCommenting on the medtech sector, Poly Medicure MD Himanshu Baid said it is imperative for companies to step up their investments in R&D and innovation to sustain growth momentum.\n\n\"The future belongs to those who can develop transformative technologies that address the healthcare needs of a dynamic and diverse world. With initiatives like the new medical devices scheme and a favourable regulatory environment providing the necessary foundation, India is well-positioned to expand its influence globally,\" he added.\n\nAs the market is expected to reach USD 50 billion by FY30, the med-tech industry's growth story reflects the power of collaboration and self-reliance, he added.\n\nMetropolis Healthcare Promoter and Executive Chairperson Ameera Shah said as the diagnostics industry progresses from USD 13 billion in FY23 towards an expected USD 25 billion by FY28, it is fuelled by increasing awareness of preventive healthcare, an aging population, and broader insurance coverage.\n\nHowever, the path forward demands a strategic focus on technology, accessibility, and collaboration, she added.\n\nThe future of diagnostics lies in embracing genomics, digitalisation and technologies such as AI, machine learning, and data analytics, Shah said."

            "source": "pv magazine International",
            "article_content": "From pv magazine 12/24-01/25\n\nJust over a decade ago, Sandia National Laboratories founded the PV Performance Modeling Collaborative (PVPMC). PVPMC is increasing transparency and accuracy in PV system performance modeling, according to Sandia, with the organization helping to bring together stakeholders to improve modeling practices. Joshua Stein, senior scientist at Sandia, thinks it is time for a similar effort to shed light onto data analytics for PV plant performance monitoring.\n\n\u201cThere is a lack of standardization and harmonization in the way people are talking about fault analytics and monitoring,\u201d he explained to pv magazine. Currently, some companies are offering services that include data analytics and fault identification and classification based on monitoring data from PV power plants. However, these companies each use their own set of failure definitions, which means that it is very difficult to compare and contrast the value of these services.\n\n\u201cImagine if every doctor or hospital you visited used their own set of diagnoses and clinical practices.\u201d said Stein. \u201cIt would be very difficult and confusing to get a second opinion. Most mature industries standardize their definitions of faults and mitigation procedures. Solar PV is not quite there yet.\u201d\n\nFor one thing, the introduction of machine learning techniques to automate fault detection in PV systems has further muddied the picture. Stein was careful to clarify that he is not against machine learning. \u201cAutomated ML-based fault detection is beneficial in that it can lead to highly scalable analytics,\u201d said Stein.\n\nRethinking KPIs\n\nTechnical key performance indicators (KPIs) are essential for evaluating PV power plants, from the development stage to contractual agreements between asset owners and O&M providers.\n\n\u201cWhile IEC and ASTM standards define some KPIs, such as performance ratio (PR) and capacity tests, their calculation methods often vary or rely on user interpretation, leading to uncertain results,\u201d said Stein\u2019s Sandia Labs colleague Marios Theristis.\n\n\u201cFor instance, there is significant flexibility in data handling, which can introduce biases that impact contracts and financial decisions. Without clear KPI definitions and harmonized calculations, contracts may be unfairly affected \u2013 not due to actual under-performance or over-performance, but because of calculation bias,\u201d he added.\n\nBad data is data that is not useful because it has been obtained through inadequate means. It contains errors or it isn\u2019t clean. This in turn creates problems for PV stakeholders who rely on it to tell them what their system\u2019s actual performance is.\n\nStandard industry practice is for asset owners to subcontract an O&M provider to take care of operation and maintenance. This means a contractual agreement dictating the power plant is being maintained appropriately and meeting certain KPIs.\n\n\u201cIf you have bad data quality, then there will be some bias introduced in the KPI estimation. This bias can be positive, or it can be negative. In a hypothetical scenario where the PR bias is negative, then the O&M provider would be unfairly paying penalties caused by data quality, and not under-performance,\u201d said Theristis.\n\nThis also works in reverse where an O&M provider could benefit, due to bias caused by data quality and not plant over-performance. Theristis continued: \u201cIn some cases, the operational PR is compared to the pre-construction PR generated by a PV design software, leading to an apples-to-oranges comparison: Is the PR difference due to an overly optimistic pre-construction simulation or actual underperformance?\u201d\n\nProgram transparency\n\nTheristis has begun a new program to tackle these issues, the PV O&M Analytics Collaborative (PVMAC). He introduced the project at the EU PVSEC conference held in Vienna in September 2024.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to create a collaborative network to improve transparency in PV analytics software and services, engage with monitoring/analytic companies, O&M providers, asset owners, insurers, and help these stakeholders come together to agree on what standards are needed and improve the overall market\u2019s transparency,\u201d he said.\n\nThe team is also using Sandia Labs\u2019 supercomputers to run simulations across the United States to reduce uncertainties in KPI estimation.\n\nPVMAC is still very new, but over the next few months the researchers will meet with industry to carry out interviews and tests such as blind analytic comparisons. This involves giving stakeholders real or synthetic performance data and asking them to identify and classify faults and calculate KPIs.\n\n\u201cBlind comparisons are a great way to evaluate the state of the industry practice and the consistency between different providers.\n\n\u201cWe expect that these comparisons will highlight discrepancies in how different companies define faults and calculate KPIs,\u201d said Stein.\n\n\u201cWe plan to host dedicated sessions on O&M analytics, failure and KPI harmonization at our upcoming PVPMC workshops,\u201d added Theristis.\n\nStandardizing performance\n\nThe two scientists hope that by shining light on any inconsistencies, it will be easier to build consensus on the steps needed for standardization. For example, an O&M provider that offers a performance guarantee could be incentivized to not clean irradiance sensors well because a dirty pyranometer makes the PV performance appear better than it actually is. The goal for Stein and Theristis is to quickly determine why a PV plant is under-performing and suggest strategies for addressing the problems.\n\nA lot is at stake, even a small percentage of underperformance for a large PV plant results in significant financial losses. Stein reckons measuring the performance of a PV system is not that different from measuring the health of a person.\n\n\u201cYou collect data about your patient, e.g., vital signs, medical history, if these indicate a more serious problem, you order more tests. At least in medicine, standards are pretty much international, so it doesn\u2019t matter where you go in the world, you will be evaluated in a similar manner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that with PV, we can have a similar system. The oil and gas industry, for instance, has been standardized. If you go to an oil rig or a gas turbine in any country in the world, the standards are similar,\u201d he said.\n\nTangled web\n\nPoor power plant management can also pose problems. Theristis warned that although many O&M products and services are available, asset owners may not have \u201ca quantitative knowledge\u201d of the potential benefits of investing in data quality, O&M, and analytic capabilities. \u201cThese solutions have not achieved transparency and lack independent validation,\u201d he said.\n\nUsing supervised machine learning methods for classification is preferable to unsupervised, according to Stein, because the former allows you to tell the algorithm what the categories are.\n\n\u201cBut many people opt for unsupervised, which basically says there\u2019s a problem without necessarily specifying the problem,\u201d said Stein. \u201cIt can get tangled up in clustering algorithms which say all these problems are similar somehow and then if you use the same practice on multiple data sets you can end up with clustered data, but it is clustered in for different reasons.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the dangers of machine learning; it works for a particular data set, but it\u2019s hard to extend it to a different data set that you haven\u2019t trained it on.\u201d\n\nIf machine learning is to be used effectively to monitor fault detection, the industry must first agree on how these faults are defined. Not all companies selling and using AI or machine learning solutions to identify faults are using these methods consistently and transparently, Stein said.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is the problem is not all companies are doing the same thing. Some companies are doing very good work and have very valuable products but there\u2019s nobody out there actually coming up with the standards and validation so those companies can be properly valued, right?\u201d\n\nThe scientist warned that \u2018AI hype\u2019 might be to blame. \u201cMany companies advertise that their software uses AI technology, but few are willing to describe exactly how it is being used. And so, each company has their own sort of \u2018diagnostic manual\u2019 for what can go wrong with the PV system,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence is just a buzzword sometimes.\u201d"

Trump has said publicly that allowing U.S.-made long-range missiles inside Russia was a big mistake.\n\nSo far, the missiles have been effective in limited ways, but they have not changed the war\u2019s trajectory, senior NATO officials said.\n\nThe war has also not escalated as some had feared. Although Russia launched a powerful new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile at a Ukrainian weapons facility after the first two volleys of Western long-range missiles, it has since responded to them with its usual mix of drones, missiles and threats."

            "article_content": "It is important to recognise the hidden costs that armed conflicts inflict upon the environment and the communities living in the affected areas. While the loss of human lives and destruction of infrastructures are painfully evident, the environmental devastation result in long-term damage to ecosystems, health, and livelihoods too, that often go unacknowledged.\n\nWhen conflicts erupt, they do not just affect combatants and civilians directly involved; they also leave scars on the environment that indirectly affect future generations. The destruction of natural resources, pollution of water supplies, deforestation, soil erosion, and biodiversity losses are some of the irreversible impacts of war on the environment. Environmental exploitation during conflict frequently manifests in the form of scorched-earth tactics, uncontrolled waste disposal, and unrestricted mining. These activities not only damage the local ecosystem but also have a significant influence on the communities that rely on these resources for survival.\n\nInternational law offers some protection to the environment during armed conflicts. Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions explicitly prohibits methods of warfare that may cause \"widespread, long-term, and severe\" damage to the environment. Additionally, the United Nations Environment Programme has highlighted the need for accountability for environmental destruction during wartime. Despite these provisions, enforcement remains challenging, and many conflicts continue to devastate ecosystems with impunity. Efforts by the International Law Commission to draft principles on protecting the environment in relation to armed conflicts are a hopeful step. However, since these are without binding authority, such initiatives remain largely symbolic.\n\nOne of the most pressing examples of environmental exploitation in conflict zones is the ongoing situation in Palestine. Decades of conflict have left Palestine's environment in a state of ruin, impacting everything from agricultural lands to access to clean water. The Israeli-Palestinian war has led to restrictions on Palestinian access to essential water resources, leaving many communities with grossly limited or contaminated water supplies. The destruction of olive groves and agricultural lands not only disrupts the market economy but also erodes the land, making it difficult for communities to cultivate crops or sustain livestock.\n\nMoreover, pollutants from destroyed infrastructure, discarded ammunition, and military equipment have contaminated Palestinian soil and water sources. According to the UNEP, such environmental degradation disproportionately affects Palestinians, who rely heavily on agriculture and limited natural resources. This ongoing environmental impact represents a form of structural violence, as it continues to undermine the livelihoods and health of Palestinian civilians, especially those in Gaza, where environmental destruction has exacerbated living conditions to critical levels.\n\nOther conflicting regions suffer similarly. In Iraq, years of conflict have turned the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, once lifelines for agriculture and drinking water, into polluted channels. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, conflict-driven mineral extraction has resulted in severe deforestation and habitat loss, threatening biodiversity and the health of communities. Syria's once-fertile lands are now barren, with soils and water sources contaminated by extensive bombings, pushing countless farmers into poverty.\n\nIn each of these cases, communities are left to bear the environmental and human costs of war long after the conflicts end. These impacts, often unseen and unmeasured, deprive future generations of a sustainable environment, healthy food sources, and safe water supplies. To address these issues, there must be an international commitment to uphold and strengthen legal protections for the environment during armed conflict. Expanding the scope of the Geneva Conventions and ensuring accountability for environmental harm can offer some relief. An international mechanism for investigating and prosecuting environmental war crimes could act as a deterrent too.\n\nMoreover, rebuilding efforts should prioritise environmental rehabilitation as a critical aspect of post-conflict recovery. The restoration of ecosystems, cleaning of polluted water sources, and reforestation efforts can help communities regain their self-sufficiency and rebuild livelihoods disrupted by conflict.\n\nThe writer is Lecturer, Department of Law, National University, Gazipur."

            "article_content": "The AI computing market may shift in 2025, opening opportunities for smaller companies.\n\nNvidia dominates AI computing. Evolving workloads could benefit competitors.\n\nCompanies like Groq, Positron, and SambaNova focus on inference to challenge Nvidia's market hold.\n\nIn 2025, the tides may turn for companies hoping to compete with the $3 trillion gorilla in AI computing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia holds an estimated 90% of the market share for AI computing. Still, as the use of AI grows, workloads are expected to change, and this evolution may give companies with competitive hardware an opening.\n\nIn 2024, the majority of AI compute spend shifted to inference, Thomas Sohmers, CEO of chip startup Positron AI, told BI. This will \"continue to grow on what looks like an exponential curve,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn AI, inference is the computation needed to produce the response to a user's query or request. The computing required to teach the model the knowledge needed to answer is called \"training.\" Creating OpenAI's image generation platform Sora, for example, represents training. Each user who instructs it to create an image represents an inference workload.\n\nOpenAI's other models have Sohmers and others excited about the growth in computing needs in 2025.\n\nOpenAI's o1 and o3, Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and a handful of other AI models use more compute-intensive strategies to improve results after training. These strategies are often called inference-time computing, chain-of-thought, chain-of-reasoning, or reasoning models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimply put, if the models think more before they answer, the responses are better. That thinking comes at a cost of time and money.\n\nThe startups vying for some of Nvidia's market share are attempting to optimize one or both.\n\nNvidia already benefits from these innovations, CEO Jensen Huang said on the company's November earnings call. Huang's wannabe competitors are betting that in 2025, new post-training strategies for AI will benefit all purveyors of inference chips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to three challengers about their hopes and expectations for 2025. Here are their New Year's resolutions.\n\nWhat's one thing within your control that could make 2025 a big year for alternative chips?\n\nMark Heaps is the chief technology evangelist for Nvidia challenger Groq. Groq\n\nMark Heaps, chief technology evangelist, Groq:\n\n\"Execution, execution, execution. Right now, everybody at Groq has decided not to take a holiday break this year. Everyone is executing and building the systems. We are all making sure that we deliver to the opportunity that we've got because that is in our control.\n\nI tell everyone our funnel right now is carbonated and bubbling over. It's unbelievable, the amount of customer interest. We have to build more systems, and we have to stand up those systems so we can serve the demand that we've got. We want to serve all those customers. We want to increase rate limits for everybody.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO, SambaNova Systems:\n\n\"For SambaNova, the most critical factor is executing on the shift from training to inference. The industry is moving rapidly toward real-time applications, and inference workloads are becoming the lion's share of AI demand. Our focus is on ensuring our technology enables enterprises to scale efficiently and sustainably.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nThomas Sohmers, CEO, Positron:\n\n\"My belief is if we can actually deploy enough compute \u2014 which thankfully I think we can from a supply chain perspective \u2014 by deploying significantly more inference-specific compute, we're going to be able to grow the adoption rate of 'chain of thoughts' and other inference-additional compute.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's one thing you're hoping for that's not in your control for 2025?\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO and cofounder of SambaNova Systems. SambaNova Systems\n\nHeaps:\n\n\"It's about customers recognizing that there are novel advancements against incumbent technologies. There's a lot of folks that have told us, 'We like what you have, but to use the old adage and rephrase it: No one ever got fired for buying from \u2014 insert incumbent.'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we know that it's starting to boil up. People are realizing it's hard for them to get chips from the incumbent, and it's also not as performant as Groq is. So my wish would be that people are willing to take that chance and actually look to some of these new technologies.\"\n\nLiang:\n\n\"If I had a magic wand, I'd address the power challenges around deploying AI. Today, most of the market is stuck using power-hungry hardware that wasn't designed for inference at scale. The result is an unsustainable approach \u2014 economically and environmentally.\n\nAt SambaNova, we've proven there's a better way. Our architecture consumes 10 times less power, making it possible for enterprises to deploy AI systems that meet their goals without blowing past their power budgets or carbon targets. I'd like to see the market move faster toward adopting technologies that prioritize efficiency and sustainability \u2014 because that's how we ensure AI can scale globally without overwhelming the infrastructure that supports it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSohmers:\n\n\"I would like people to actually adopt these chain of thought capabilities at the fastest rate possible. I think that is a huge shift \u2014 from a capabilities perspective. You have 8 billion parameter models surpassing 70 billion parameter models. So I'm trying to do everything I can to make that happen.\"\n\nWhat's your New Year's resolution?\n\nPositron AI executives. From left to right: Edward Kmett, Thomas Sohmers, Adam Huson, and Greg Davis. Positron AI\n\nHeaps:\n\n\"In the last six months, I've gone to a number of hackathons, and I've met developers. It's deeply inspiring. So my New Year's resolution is to try to amplify the signal of the good that people are doing with AI.\"\n\nLiang:\n\n\"Making time for music. Playing guitar is something I've always loved, and I would love to get back into it. Music has this incredible way of clearing the mind and sparking creativity, which I find invaluable as we work to bring SambaNova's AI to new corners of the globe.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSohmers:\n\nI want to do as much to encourage the usage of these new tools to help, you know, my mom. Part of the reason I got into technology was because I wanted to see these tools lift up people to be able to do more with their time \u2014 to learn everything that they want beyond whatever job they're in. I think that bringing the cost down of these things will enable that proliferation.\n\nI also personally want to see and try to use more of these things outside of my just work context because I've been obsessively using the o1 Pro model for the past few weeks, and it's been amazing for my personal work. But when I gave access to my mom what she would do with it was pretty interesting \u2014 those sort of normal, everyday person tasks for these things where it truly is being an assistant.\""

            "article_content": "As India lost its soft-spoken former prime minister, here\u2019s a look at how Manmohan Singh transformed the face of the Indian economy in 1991 read more\n\nIndia\u2019s first Sikh Prime Minister and the architect of the Indian economy Dr Manmohan Singh passed away on Thursday at age 92. A statement from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) hospital said that Singh died due to an \u201cage-related medical condition\u201d. The soft-spoken former prime minister was born in undivided Punjab and was touted as the man who saved the Indian economy.\n\nWhen India was on the verge of bankruptcy, Singh, who was then the Finance Minister, introduced policy changes that changed the country\u2019s economic trajectory. As India now stands tall as the fifth-largest economy in the world, Singh\u2019s revolutionary policies acted as a foundation for its growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an impassioned speech, while presenting the Budget of 1991, Singh quoted Victor Hugo saying: \u201cI do not minimise the difficulties that lie ahead on the long and arduous journey on which we have embarked. But as Victor Hugo once said, \u2018No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come.\u2019 I suggest to this august House that the emergence of India as a major economic power in the world happens to be one such idea\".\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how Singh saved the Indian economy from collapsing.\n\nPrelude to the whole saga\n\nSingh was sworn in as the Finance Minister in former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao\u2019s cabinet in June 1991. During this time, the Indian economy was operating in accordance with the Nehruvian-socialist agenda. However, the economy was struggling with external debt pegged at 23 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product and Internal public debt amounting to 55 per cent of the GDP.\n\nNot only this, the Indian employment rates went down to a negative and the fiscal deficit stood at eight per cent of the GDP. The effects of the poor state of the economy were felt everywhere with inflation rising by a good 13 per cent and retail inflation going even higher up the bend by a whopping 17 per cent.\n\nThe most concerning aspect of it all was the fact that India\u2019s Foreign Exchange Reserves stood as low as Rs 2500 crores, which was 75 per cent lower than what it was in 1990. Overall, the Indian economy was facing a major crisis and the leaders were in desperate need to bring out new reforms.\n\nSingh: The best man for the endeavour\n\nWhen Singh took the helm, he was facing the major task of changing the face of the struggling Indian economy. Many believe that he was the best person for the job. Singh had a strong background in Business, Economics and Globalisation, having obtained a degree in economics from Oxford University.\n\nHe worked in the United Nations for three consecutive years and had another stint as an advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The former premier also held the post of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 1982-1985. He served as Chief Economic Advisor (1972-1976) and Planning Commission Head (1985-1987). Hence it was safe to say that Singh knew the ins and outs of the Indian economy more than anyone who was in charge at that time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6 ways Manmohan Singh saved the Indian economy\n\nSingh was tasked to present the first budget of the Rao government, in less than a month after he took charge of the finance ministry. After evaluating the situation at hand Singh realised that the Indian economy needed a shift towards economic liberalisation and a strategic end to the \u2018license raj\u2019. Here are 6 ways Singh changed the trajectory of the Indian economy:\n\n1. Devaluation Programme\n\nSingh started his endeavour with a two-step devaluation programme with the RBI devaluing the Indian currency against major currencies by nine per cent initially and then brought down to eleven per cent two days later. This gave the Indian economy a much-needed boost to trade and deal with the International markets.\n\n2. Welcoming Foreign Investments\n\nSingh brought India out of the Nehurivan socialist ideology and opened doors to welcome foreign investment into the Indian Capital. With the introduction of \u201cLiberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation (LPG)\u201d, Singh\u2019s policies gave a boost to industrialisation in the country. With these reforms, the Indian entrepreneurs were given direct access to the required capital, technology and target markets around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Mortaging India\u2019s gold holdings\n\nThe next thing the former prime minister did was to convince the RBI board to mortgage India\u2019s gold holdings with the Bank of England in four tranches. This way, India managed to get the necessary financial assistance it needed to sail. Singh got the idea from the State Bank of India which sold 20 tonnes of gold to the Union Bank of Switzerland, for which they had received about $200 million.\n\n4. Restructuring India\u2019s trade policy\n\nSingh had to restructure the Indian trade policy since it was on the verge of being banned from essential imports such as oil and gas. Under the LPG, Singh\u2019s reforms called for doing away with unnecessary controls, streamlining the licensing process and linking non-essential imports to exports to discourage such imports. Singh took the hard decision to abolish the popular \u2019export subsidies\u2019 along with the further expansion of the \u201cLicense Raj\u201d opening the country\u2019s economy to a great extent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Taking help from the IMF\n\nGiven the crisis at hand, Singh called for economic relief from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He applied for an emergency loan of $220 million, which was later seen as the main tool which prevented India from recording a debt default. While India had to follow some of the conditions presented by the international financial body, Singh\u2019s reforms acted as a cushion between India\u2019s socialist background and the IMF\u2019s capitalist and liberalising approach.\n\n6. Market Regulators\n\nSingh also called for the transfer of full statutory powers to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to enable it to regulate the workings of the Stock Exchanges in the country. Hence, SEBI soon became India\u2019s sole market regulator. Singh went on to propose a tax concession under section 80HHC of the Income Tax Act to export of software. As a result of this concession, the Indian Software companies became more cost-effective.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Singh has garnered several criticisms from his opposition, over the years, one thing that cannot be denied is the fact that he managed to save the Indian economy from shamble in 1991."

            "article_content": "The end of the year typically brings with it an emotional look back at the days gone by. For archaeologists, looking back into the past is pretty much an every day thing. That said, here are 10 of the most interesting archeological findings that Popular Science covered this year.\n\nNeanderthals and early humans intermingled Europe earlier\n\nStone tools from the Lincombian\u2013Ranisian\u2013Jerzmanowician (LRJ) culture uncovered at Ranis. Item 1 is a partial bifacial blade point characteristic of the LRJ. Item 2 also contains finely made bifacial leaf points. CREDITL \u00a9 Josephine Schubert, Museum Burg Ranis.\n\nIn January, a new genetic analysis of bone fragments from an archaeological site in central Germany found that modern humans had reached northern Europe 45,000 years ago. This new timeline means that their arrival overlapped with the Neanderthals who had been living there for several thousand years before going extinct. It also bolsters the theory that the movement of modern humans into Europe and Asia about 50,000 years ago helped drive Neanderthals into extinction. The findings were described in three separate papers published in the journals Nature and Nature Ecology and Evolution.\n\nMysterious Iron Age burials\n\nThe skeletal remains of a frog and a human were uncovered at Seminario Vescovile in Verona, Italy. CREDIT: S.R. Thompson/SABAP-VR/Laffranchi et al., 2024\n\nA team of archeologists from Italy and Switzerland found that animals buried alongside humans might have been intended to be a meal or companion in the afterlife. They also may have been part of a complex funeral rite during the Iron Age, according to their study published in February in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nOf the 161 people buried at the Seminario Vescovile site in Verona, Italy, 16 were buried alongside animals. Four of the people at this site were buried alongside the remains of dogs and/or horses. These animals were not commonly eaten and the presence of horses and dogs was significant to the team. Earlier Iron Age findings in France and Switzerland indicate that horses and dogs were symbolic at the time and were often present in what appears to be sacrificial rituals, funeral rites, and are frequently associated with specific deities from the time. For the team on this study, the characteristics of a plot called Burial 46 were particularly interesting.\n\n\u201cIt includes the complete skeleton of a horse positioned above a woman, along with the cranium of a dog and the remains of additional horses,\u201d Marco Milella, a co-author of the new study and anthropologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told Popular Science. \u201cThis discovery provides a glimpse into a remarkably complex funerary ritual. While drawing scientifically robust conclusions from just two cases is challenging, we are prompted to consider whether this occurrence is merely coincidental or indicative of a deeper pattern.\u201d\n\nAncient Maya ballcourts were for more than games\n\n\n\nA decorative ring made from carved stone is embedded in the wall of a ballcourt in the ancient Maya city of Chichen Itza in present day Mexico. CREDIT: LanaCanada.\n\n\n\nAncient Mayans may have made ceremonial offerings during the construction of the ballcourts that they used for sporting events. Advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis helped a team of scientists detect evidence of several plants that are known for both medicinal and religious purposes. The team found evidence of four different plants that are associated with ancient Maya medicine and divination rituals.\n\nThese microscopic fragments of ancient plants were found beneath the floor of a Mayan ballcourt in present day Mexico and collecting them was likely purposeful. The findings were described in a study published in the journal PLOS One in April.\n\nThe ball courts in this study were used for several ball games, including pok-a-tok. This combination of soccer and basketball is also undergoing a present day revival. Players likely tried to get a ball through a ring in a hoop affixed to a wall. Ballcourts were considered significant places within cities and even built near some of the largest temples, including in ancient Maya cities like Tikal in Guatemala.\n\n[Related: Tooth powder unlocks clues to an 800-year-old mystery of man thrown into well.]\n\nDecoding the Norton Disney Dodecaheadron\n\nThe dodecahedron on display at the National Civil War Centre, Newark Museum. CREDIT: Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group.\n\nIn the spring, the largest known Roman dodecahedron went on display in England.The cast bronze object was uncovered in the village of Norton Disney in the Midlands of eastern England It is hollow at its middle and roughly the size of a clenched fist and has 12 flat faces are shaped like pentagons. At roughly three inches tall and weighing half a pound, it is one of the largest of these strange Roman objects ever discovered.\n\nThe dodecahedron was sitting among the ruins of a Roman pit and was likely placed there about 1,700 years ago. It was found \u201cin situ,\u201d or deliberately placed among 4th Century CE Roman pottery in some sort of hole or quarry. More archeological excavation is needed to clarify exactly what this pit was used for.\n\n\u201cRoman society was full of superstition, something experienced on a daily basis,\u201d the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group wrote in a statement. \u201cA potential link with local religious practice is our current working theory. More investigation is required though.\u201d\n\nArchaeology in space?\n\nA sample location in the starboard Maintenance Work Area of the International Space Station. The yellow dotted line indicates the boundaries of the sample area. CREDIT: NASA / ISSAP\n\nThe icy cold reaches of space is not exactly the first place to come to mind for archaeological discoveries. That didn\u2019t stop a team from California\u2019s Chapman University to see what they could find on the International Space Station (ISS). The team applied a traditional field strategy aboard the ISS for the first time. They applied the shovel test pit to analyze how the ever-changing \u201cmicrosociety\u201d aboard the ISS has adapted and changed over time.\n\nBack here on Earth, these projects typically involve digging small excavations at regular intervals across a site to gather information on how artifacts are distributed, then pick particularly promising pits for more thorough study. Since there really isn\u2019t anything to \u201cdig\u201d on the ISS, the team selected six locations throughout the space station and tasked astronauts to take daily photos of each space over roughly two months in 2022.\n\nTheir study published in August in the journal PLOS ONE identified 5,438 examples of \u201cartifacts\u201d including an augmented reality headset, Post-It notes, gloves, tools, and writing tools like Sharpie pens. While it is only an initial survey into this subject matter, it\u2019s the first of its kind to document how humans adapt to a novel environment completely removed from what we as a species evolved to handle.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

CREDIT: Professor Nick Pearce, Aberystwyth University, Picasa\n\nIn August, a new hypothesis for where Stonehenge\u2019s six-ton Altar Stone originated was published in the journal Nature. It likely originated 400 miles north in Scotland and not from Wales or other closer areas of southern England as scientists previously thought. This long trek points to the possibility that more advanced transportation methods and societal organization existed here about 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe Altar Stone is about 16 feet long and 19 inches thick and sits at the center of the circle. While it is not currently standing upright like the other stones, scientists are still uncertain if it stood vertically at some point. It arrived in the area sometime around 2,500 BCE, but its exact arrival date is still a mystery.\n\nChemical fingerprints within the grains matched rocks from northeast Scotland and were very different from Welsh bedrock. Specifically, with the age of the zircon minerals in the stone, the team is over 95 percent certain that it came all the way from northeastern Scotland.\n\nCheesy mummies\n\nTarim mummies from the present-day Xinjiang region of Northwestern China. CREDIT: Wenying Li\n\nAt least three embalmed bodies buried with some cheese on them were discovered at an ancient burial site in Xinjiang in northwestern China. The small lumps of fermented dairy, laid around the necks of the deceased, represent the longest-aged cheese ever discovered\u2013at roughly 3,500 years old.\n\nThe ancient cheese was incredibly well-preserved, but a new assessment of the chunks reveals some long-obsecured knowledge about human culture and a potential path for how dairy may have spread across Asia. The findings were published in the journal Cell in September.\n\nA new look at an Ancient Egyptian mummy\n\nLady Chenet-aa\u2019s mummy included artificial eyes to help her see in the afterlife. CREDIT: The Field Museum / Morgan Clark / Popular Science\n\nA team from Chicago\u2019s Field Museum used a CT scanner to determine Ancient Egyptian Lady Chenet-aa\u2019s burial procedure. Lady Chenet-aa lived roughly 3,000 years ago amid the 22nd Dynasty during Egypt\u2019s Third Intermediate Period. Soon after her death, one of the ways funerary experts prepared her for the afterlife was by constructing a cartonnage\u2014a paper mache-like box housing a deceased person\u2019s body.\n\nHowever, Chenet-aa\u2019s lacks any hint of a visible seam, leaving Egyptologists to wonder for years exactly how embalmers placed her inside the casing. Field Museum senior conservator JP Brown likened the mummy and its cartonnage coffin to a model ship inside a bottle.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly important that the inner coffin appeared whole and smooth without any external seams (unlike the outer coffin which was made of wood),\u201d Brown explained to Popular Science. \u201c\u2026 [and] if you look at the shape of cartonnage, the opening at the foot is too narrow for the mummy\u2019s shoulders to fit through.\u201d\n\nPompeii DNA tells a different story\n\nTwo of the plaster body casts from the Pompeii archaeological site. CREDIT: Archaeological Park of Pompei\n\nA new genetic analysis of 14 bodies recovered from Pompeii shed doubt on some of the initial interpretations of who these people were before the cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Using a new genomic analysis, a team of scientists found that their biological sexes and family relationships don\u2019t match up with the initial interpretations. The findings were published in November in the journal Current Biology.\n\nOne notable example is an adult wearing a golden bracelet found holding a child. This was traditionally interpreted to be a mother and child, but the new analysis found that it was an unrelated adult male and child. Additionally, a pair believed to be sisters or mother and daughter, included one genetic male.\n\n[Related: Focaccia likely originated in Mesopotamia, not Rome.]\n\nNeanderthals also loved to collect things\n\nThese marine fossils were found in a Neanderthal cave site, but aren\u2019t native to the area. CREDIT: Quaternary\n\nThe act of collecting objects may stretch at least as far back as our Neanderthal ancestry, according to relics uncovered in a cave in Iberia, Spain.\n\nAn archeological team analyzed 15 small marine fossils found in the fourth level of the Prado Vargas Cave system. While one artifact showed physical evidence of use as a hammer, the other 14 fossils displayed no obvious physical wear or utilitarian value. Additional evidence in the caves also points to the site serving as a semi-permanent Neanderthal encampment likely used for toolmaking, hunting, or perhaps even ritualistic activities.\n\nEarlier research shows Neanderthals engaged in cultural rituals such as ornamental crafting, cave wall art, and even familial and social funeral burials. Due to these rituals, experts argue that it stands to reason the human ancestors likely participated in pastimes such as collecting items they thought were interesting or special in some way.\n\nMaking clothes fit for the ice age\n\nMicro-CT scans of bone needle and needle specimens and the species they were compared with. CREDIT: Pelton et al., 2024, PLOS ONE\n\nIn November, a team in Wyoming proposed the idea that Paleolithic North Americans likely made needles using the bones of foxes, hares, rabbits, bobcats, mountain lions, lynx, and even the now-extinct American cheetah.\n\nBone needles like the ones from this study are common during this period in the North American archaeological record because sewing complex weather garments for freezing weather was a necessity in response to the cold climate shift brought on by the last ice age. There has been little direct evidence of such garments, but bone needles and the bones of the fur-bearing animals used to make pelts provide some indirect evidence of this early tailoring.\n\n\u201cThey were complex garments fringed with the furs of red fox, hare, and cat, some of which with feet still attached as is common among modern trappers,\u201d study co-author and Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton told Popular Science. \u201cThey were likely comparable to similar garments worn by the Inuit, able to withstand the cold and windy conditions of Wyoming\u2019s last Ice Age.\u201d"

But a crucial step is skipped because it has puzzled scientists since the earliest days\u2014how does the real, classical world emerge from, often, a large number of solutions for the wave functions?\n\nEach of these wave functions has its individual shape and associated energy level, but how does the wave function \"collapse\" into what we see as the classical world\u2014atoms, cats and the pool noodles floating in the tepid swimming pool of a seedy hotel in Las Vegas hosting a convention of hungover businessmen trying to sell the world a better mousetrap?\n\nAt a high level, this is handled by the \"Born rule\"\u2014the postulate that the probability density for finding an object at a particular location is proportional to the square of the wave function at that position.\n\nErwin Schr\u00f6dinger invented his famous feline as a way to amplify the consequences of the collapsing wave function\u2014a simple event, such as a quantum event of the radioactive decay of an atomic nucleus, somehow translates into the macroscopic cat in the box being, either alive or dead. (This mysterious transition, perhaps theoretical only, is called the Heisenberg Cut.)\n\nTraditional quantum mechanics says that at any time the cat becomes either alive or dead when the box is opened and the cat state is \"measured.\" Before that, the cat is, in a sense, both alive and dead\u2014it exists in a quantum superposition of each state. It is only when the box is opened and its inside is viewed does the wave function of the cat collapse into a definite state of being either alive or dead.\n\nIn recent years, physicists have been looking at this process more deeply to understand what's happening. Modifying the Schr\u00f6dinger equation has had only limited success.\n\nOther ideas than the Copenhagen interpretation described above, such as De Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, are receiving more attention.\n\nNow a team of quantum theorists from Spain have used numerical simulations to show that, on large scales, features of the classical world can emerge from a wide class of quantum systems. Their work is published in the journal Physical Review X.\n\n\"Quantum physics is at odds with our classical experience as far as the behavior of single electrons, atoms or photons is concerned,\" lead author Philip Strasberg of the Autonomous University of Barcelona told Phys.org.\n\n\"However, if one zooms out, and considers coarse quantities that we humans can perceive (for example, the temperature of our morning coffee or the position of a stone), our results indicate that quantum interference effects, which are responsible for weird quantum behavior, vanish.\"\n\nTheir finding suggests that the classical world we see can emerge from the many-worlds picture of quantum mechanics, where many universes exist at the same point in spacetime and where almost a potentially huge number of worlds branch off from ours every time a measurement is made.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Poke holes in the bag and water\u2014which inside the bag is a large collection of frequently colliding molecules moving in random directions\u2014will stream out in mostly smooth flows. This is akin to how the complicated jumble of a quantum system nonetheless appears in the classical world as something we recognize and feel familiar with.\n\nBut a technical problem remained with the many-worlds portrait: how do we reconcile the many-universes with the classical experience we have within our one universe? After all, we never see cats in a superposition of alive and dead. A priori, how can we speak of other universes or worlds or branches in any meaningful sense?\n\nIn their paper, Strasberg and co-authors write \"Speaking of different worlds or histories becomes meaningful if we can reason about their past, present, and future in classical terms.\"\n\nThe co-authors attempted to solve this problem in a new way. While previous work has brought in the idea of quantum decoherence\u2014where the objects we see arise out of the many superpositions of a quantum system when it interacts with their environment. But this approach has a fine-tuning problem\u2014it only works for specific types of interactions and types of initial wave functions.\n\nBy contrast, the group showed that a stable, self-consistent set of features emerges from the range of many possible evolutions of a wave function (with many energy levels) at observable, non-microscopic scales. This solution does not have a fine-tuning problem, works for a wide choice of initial conditions and the details of the interactions between energy levels.\n\n\"In particular,\" Strasberg told Phys.org, \"we provide clear evidence that this vanishing [of quantum interference effects] happens extremely fast\u2014to be precise: exponentially fast\u2014with growing system size. That is, even a few atoms or photons can behave classically. Furthermore, it is a ubiquitous and generic phenomenon that does not require any fine tuning: the emergence of a classical world is inevitable.\"\n\nThe group numerically simulated quantum evolution for up to five time-steps and up to 50,000 energy levels for nontrivial quantum systems. Though that evolution is still small compared to what will be needed to simulate everyday classical phenomena, it's much larger than any previous work.\n\nThey considered a broad range of choices of the initial wave function and of coupling strengths and found approximately the same large-scale structure of stable branches exist\u2014the emergence of a stable and slowly evolving macroscopic structure.\n\n\"Remarkably, we also explicitly demonstrate that interesting classical worlds can emerge from a quantum system that is overall in thermodynamic equilibrium. Even though it is very unlikely that this is the case in our universe, it nevertheless demonstrates that order, structure and an arrow of time can emerge on single branches of a quantum Multiverse, which overall looks chaotic, unstructured and time-symmetric.\"\n\nRelating their work to statistical mechanics, where macroscopic features like temperature and pressure emerge from a melange of randomly moving particles, the group found that some branches lead to worlds where entropy increases and others to worlds where entropy decreases. Such worlds would have opposite entropic arrows of time.\n\nMore information: Philipp Strasberg et al, First Principles Numerical Demonstration of Emergent Decoherent Histories, Physical Review X (2024).
