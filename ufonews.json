        "article_content": "0 SHARES Share Tweet\n\nUFO 50 Review: Making History\n\nBetween 1982 and 1989, UFO Soft put out a wide variety of classic games for their LX game console. Their titles ranged from shooters and RPGs to sports games and pretty much every genre under the sun. These games, and this console, have been largely forgotten over the years, but this under-heralded team was way ahead of their time and put out a catalog of games that should be considered classics. Now, 50 of those games are back in this fantastic collection called UFO 50. It celebrates what made these games great and really shows off the wide variety of games that were available on the LX.\n\nNone of that is actually true. UFO Soft never existed, and the LX game console wasn\u2019t a thing. What if they were, though? That\u2019s the question asked by some of the best games in the indie gaming space, including Derek Yu and Eirik Suhrke, who are responsible for hits like Spelunky and Downwell. Eight years ago, they got together with a group of indie developers and decided to make a fictional collection of games from a fictional company. The plan was to release it two years later, but making 50 games takes a while, and this title got pushed back again and again. Now, though, UFO 50 is finally here after eight years of development, and thankfully, it was well worth the wait.\n\nYou Can Have Whatever You Like\n\nWhen we think of a development group making 50 games for a collection, I think most of us would tend to assume those would be minigames or at least micro-games. Short and simple titles that wouldn\u2019t take long to make. That\u2019s not the case here, though, at least not largely. The games in UFO 50 are all designed as if they were made for a console released throughout the 80s. As anyone who played games in that period knows, a game that debuted in 1982 is generally very different from a game released in 1989. That means some of the early games in UFO 50 are quite simple, in the same way early black box Nintendo games were. Basic action games, puzzle games that take place on a single screen but with a fun twist, and early side-scrollers, which have a cool hook but don\u2019t look like much. By the end of the collection, though, you have incredibly cool vehicle-based shooters with unique movements, an idle game that encourages regularly returning to it, and a multi-genre action mashup that combines elements of Streets of Rage and Metal Gear with a bunch of owls who look like they belong in a late 80s cartoon.\n\nThe framing and backdrop of UFO 50 is definitely cool, but none of it would be more than a brief curiosity if the games weren\u2019t good. Thankfully though, those eight years of development paid off. In a group of 50 games, not every title can be a true must-play. Still, the hit rate for this many games is really impressive. There are a few games here that don\u2019t do much for me, like Planet Zoldath, which is a bit too slow for my taste, or Onion Delivery, which has controls that definitely feel out of the 80s but which I wouldn\u2019t have liked even then. But even these feel plucked from an era they never existed in and helped set the tone of the collection. The games here are presented in release order by default, though you can sort them many ways easily, and all games are unlocked from the start. If you play in release order as I did at first, you\u2019ll find that some of the early games are a little harder to get into. Barbuta is the first game, and it\u2019s dense, with unintuitive controls and a confusing layout that feels very 1982 but which modern players may bounce off of. Even these early games, though, often have a shocking amount of depth under the hood if you stick with them.\n\nDiving In\n\nLike action games? Mortol is a fascinating title where you have three options to sacrifice your character at any time to clear a path forward for your next life. The goal is to get through each level with as many lives remaining as possible. Kick Club is like a mix of Snow Bros and Bubble Bobble with superb style, which has kept me coming back again and again. The three Campanella titles are all great and show a wonderful evolution of a series. Velgress is basically reverse Downwell, and I mean that as a huge compliment. Rakshasa has a fantastic twist on death which allows you to keep coming back but makes it harder and harder each time you die. Seaside Drive is one of the best driving games I\u2019ve played in a while, with an absolutely killer soundtrack which is true for a lot of these games. Overbold is essentially Smash TV, but with a risk/reward system built in, which got me in trouble far more often than I\u2019d like to admit, but it always kept me coming back for one more run.\n\nIf you want something that\u2019s a bit more puzzle-like, Magic Garden has stolen more of my life in the last week than any other game here. A fascinating mix of Snake and Pac-Man, it\u2019s incredibly charming and addicting. Paint Chase mixes Splatoon with cars and works far better than it has any right to. Attactics forces you to manage your resources to build an army that can protect your castle while taking that of your opponent. Like a lot of these games, it has local multiplayer available, and it\u2019s great for it. Party House is a deck builder that I cannot stop playing, which forces you to manage resources and play a sort of risk versus reward game as you build the ultimate party.\n\nIf you like RPGs, there are plenty of options. Lords of Diskonia is a first-person dungeon crawler that mixes real-time combat with your exploration of the lost depths. Grimstone is a Wild West RPG with timing-based combat and a system of selecting your party, which surprised me from the jump. It\u2019s great, though you will need to be prepared to grind like most RPGs of that time. Vainger is Metroid with the ability to flip your world upside down at any time. Or you have Porgy, an incredibly charming, if difficult, underwater Metroidvania where you\u2019re constantly upgrading your adorable ship to go just a bit further.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nThere are some games here that are harder to group together, too. Rail Heist is an action stealth game where you must sneak onto a train and rob it while getting away with the money. It combines action with puzzle elements in a way I\u2019m not sure any actual 80s games touched, but it\u2019s very cool. Cyber Owls combines four different genres, and while no one of them feels out of time, putting them together pushes it though it is presented as the last game here chronologically. Night Manor is a rather short but impressive point-and-click game right out of the era. There are even a couple of early platform fighters here, with Hyper Contender being a lot of fun.\n\nUFO 50 offers plenty of other games here that I really liked, but I haven\u2019t even mentioned, like Rock On! Island, Mini & Max, Warptank, Waldorf\u2019s Journey, and Bug Hunter. There\u2019s too much here to go into every game with much depth, but many of these games are very good with multiple challenges to complete in each. Each game has not only a base goal of completing them but a higher cherry goal to show you really mastered the game.\n\nBeyond just providing 50 interesting games, UFO 50 also features a code console players can access to put in codes you\u2019ll find hidden throughout the game. These codes can be anything from cheats within certain games to hidden areas, which will unlock more info about UFO Soft. They\u2019re not the main reason to buy UFO 50, but they are a neat little extra for those who fall in love with this collection.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe developers of UFO 50 took on a monumental task in creating 50 unique games for their fictional collection but they accomplished it in wildly successful fashion. Not only are the large majority of these games excellent, but when taken as a fictional canon, they make each other even better. Seeing how they bounce off each other, interact, and tell a story just in the way they evolve is a wonderful experience that\u2019s unlike any other game I\u2019ve played. That said, the main reason to play UFO 50 is because it\u2019s absolutely packed with great games, many of which could have been released on their own and been successful. If you have any affinity for the era of gaming UFO 50 is depicting, you should absolutely check it out.\n\nFinal Verdict: 5/5\n\nAvailable on: PC (reviewed); Publisher: Mossmouth; Developer: Mossmouth; Players: 2; Released: September 18th, 2024; ESRB: N/A; MSRP: $24.99\n\nFull disclosure: This review is based on a retail copy of UFO 50."

        "article_content": "This year sees Schenker celebrating 50 years in the business, and as part of the celebrations, he has revisited his classic years with UFO by re-recording some of the group\u2019s greatest hits for a newly released album, My Years With UFO, which sees him collaborating with some of rock\u2019s greatest musicians such as Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 Axl Rose and Slash, Deep Purple\u2019s Roger Glover and Twisted Sister\u2019s Dee Snider to name but a few.\n\n\u201cI bumped into a few of them personally myself,\u201d Schenker says, explaining how he ended up with an esteemed list of guest musicians for the album.\n\n\u201cHow Axl Rose came to sing on one of the tracks was purely through happenstance.\n\n\u201cSlash had come over to the studio to play on a song and told me that he had told Axl he was going to be working with me.\n\n\u201cWhen Axl heard that, he asked if he could sing a song as well.\n\n\u201cSo, Axl ended up singing three songs on the album sessions: Only You Can Rock Me, Too Hot To Handle and Love To Love.\n\n\u201cBut because he\u2019s a perfectionist, he wasn\u2019t happy with his performance on Only You Can Rock Me and Too Hot To Handle. He decided to focus on one song, Love To Love, taking his time until he was happy with it.\n\n\u201cAnd once that happened, he only allowed that song to be included.\u201d\n\nSchenker affirms that much of his song catalogue with UFO started out as instrumentals before lyrics were added later.\n\n\u201cSongs such as Doctor, Doctor and Love To Love all began as instrumental pieces,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThen Phil Mogg, the singer with UFO, would hear my instrumentals and would be inspired to turn them into songs with vocals.\u201d\n\nWhile Schenker has a dedicated following worldwide and a fan base in Australia, our country is one place he\u2019s never visited. When asked why, Schenker muses philosophically.\n\n\u201cMaybe if it was meant to be, it would have happened,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAnd while it\u2019s certainly a long way to come, I\u2019d love to tour Australia if the opportunity still presented itself.\u201d\n\nSchenker\u2019s passion for the guitar and his music is evident, having been integral to his art for the past 50 years.\n\n\u201cTo be myself and to express myself has been my greatest lesson,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy that I\u2019ve lasted for 50 years, as it was definitely my mission.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m very happy that I did it and I couldn\u2019t be more happier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so fulfilling to be able to do something like that.\n\n\u201cI was really convinced it had to be my life.\u201d\n\nFor more info on Michael Schenker, visit michaelschenkerhimself.com\n\nMusic news\n\nKylie Minogue has announced a world tour for 2025. The \u2018Tension Tour\u2019 will see her performing shows in Australia in February and March. Minogue\u2019s last tour was in 2019. And speaking of Kylie, her new album, Tension II, hit the streets on October 18.\n\nFor country music fans, a new album from Australia\u2019s King of Country, the late, great Slim Dusty, hits the streets on October 4. Titled Gone Truckin\u2019, it collects 24 songs about trucking, drawn from all eras of Slim\u2019s illustrious and prolific recording career.\n\nThis week, Aussie country star and ARIA Hall-of-Famer Kasey Chambers announced a huge Australian tour for 2025 ahead of the release of her 13th album, Backbone, which is out on October 4. The 30-date tour kicks off in January and will take in capital cities and regional centres over a five-month period.\n\nIs new music from Guns N\u2019 Roses on its way? According to the group\u2019s bassist, Duff McKagan, fans can expect new music from the group \u201csooner than later\u201d.\n\nThe recent trend of rock and pop artists going country continues, with Gwen Stefani going down that route on her upcoming new album, Bouquet, due on November 15.\n\nAlso releasing a new studio album is Franz Ferdinand, with the Scottish group\u2019s sixth outing, The Human Fear, due on January 10.\n\nThe view from here\n\nOnstage dramas and altercations among band members have become more frequent in recent years. In the past, one would never have seen such display of unprofessional behaviour onstage, no matter whether it was fuelled by animosity between band members, or any personal issues a musician may had been dealing with. Whatever the scenario, it was always kept away from the stage and dealt with in a private manner, away from the prying eyes of fans.\n\nBut now, sadly, it\u2019s becoming a bit too common. The latest display occurred last week when \u201990s alter-rockers Jane\u2019s Addiction ended their show in Boston with a brawl. Mid-set through the group\u2019s performance on their current North American trek, lead vocalist Perry Farrell began jabbing guitarist Dave Navarro before it escalated to the point where Farrell threw a punch at Navarro, leading to the band\u2019s crew restraining Farrell and forcing him offstage.\n\nIn the aftermath, the band cancelled the rest of the tour, and the incident most likely spelled the end of the group. A statement released later by the group cited \u201ca continuing pattern of behaviour and mental health issues\u201d as to the cause of the onstage drama. But could this incident be representative of something that is happening on a larger scale and on a deeper level? A reflection of the turmoil musicians and artists are experiencing from the current state of the music industry, which itself is in turmoil? What occurred last week was a cry for help. The mental health of musicians must be given utmost priority of care, or else it will only lead to further episodes. And possibly, the next time it could end a lot more tragically.\n\nThis week\u2019s global classical music album charts\n\nUnited Kingdom: No.1: Islands: Essential Einaudi \u2014 Ludovico Einaudi\n\nUnited States: No.1: Genesis \u2014 The Spiritual Ensemble\n\nAustralia: No.1: In A Landscape \u2014 Max Richter\n\nFun fact\n\nBelinda Carlisle\u2019s 1989 hit song Leave a Light On, which peaked at No.5 on the Australian music chart, features the slide guitar playing of the late George Harrison from The Beatles for the song\u2019s guitar solo.\n\nJoe Matera is a local singer-songwriter, recording artist, guitarist and music journalist providing readers with all the latest music news."

Well, these stunning but surreal homes could bring you one step closer to outer space.\n\nFrom a classic UFO pod that appears to have crash-landed in someone's backyard, to a metallic igloo in rural Spain, these funky futuristic homes look like they're from a galaxy far, far away.\n\nRead on to discover extraterrestrial real estate that's truly out of this world...\n\nFuturistic igloo, Catalonia, Spain\n\nJuan Carlos / Airbnb\n\nThe town of Prades in Catalonia, Spain, dates back to ancient times, but this quirky residence is definitely from the future!\n\nLocated on a scenic plot on the outskirts of the town, the bronze-hued igloo is the ultimate spot for escaping modern society.\n\nFuturistic igloo, Catalonia, Spain\n\nJuan Carlos / Airbnb\n\nThe domed home benefits from metal cladding and small windows, which ensure it heavily resembles a spacecraft. It might look small from the outside, but it has everything a couple could need for a few days away.\n\nThere's an open-plan living space on the ground floor, complete with a kitchen, sitting area, dining zone and bathroom.\n\nFuturistic igloo, Catalonia, Spain\n\nJuan Carlos / Airbnb\n\nThanks to the home's high, curving ceiling there's also space for an amazing lofted bedroom. Located beneath the dome's glass roof, it allows guests to take in the stars while they snooze.\n\nFuturistic igloo, Catalonia, Spain\n\nJuan Carlos / Airbnb\n\nLucky guests can also spend their time relaxing and enjoying their surroundings. There's a hot tub, a communal swimming pool and even an outdoor observatory, for stargazing sessions.\n\nIf you fancy spending the night, the igloo is available to rent via Airbnb.\n\nOtherworldly masterpiece, Queensland, Australia\n\nSaul Goodwin / Property Shot Photography / Queensland Sotheby's International Realty\n\nNestled in the depths of a rainforest, you'd be forgiven for thinking that a spaceship had landed in this rural region of Queensland. In fact, the striking structure is an iconic Brutalist-inspired home designed by Charles Wright Architects in 2013.\n\nOriginally known as Stamp House, the 11,398-square-foot (1,059sqm) residence was built for stamp dealer Rob Perry. A playful nod to his profession is seen through the punctured indents that adorn the home's concrete fa\u00e7ade.\n\nOtherworldly masterpiece, Queensland, Australia\n\nSaul Goodwin / Property Shot Photography / Queensland Sotheby's International Realty\n\nThe residence's futuristic form is nothing short of showstopping. Private wings housing the property's six bedrooms cantilever off from the communal living spaces, hovering effortlessly over the water.\n\nThis seemingly gravity-defying design was inspired by more than just aesthetics. Sited in a region known for its devastating tropical cyclones, the structure's cantilevers help to minimise the impact of flooding. The protruding volumes are tough enough to withstand powerful winds, while preventing water from breaching the property.\n\nOtherworldly masterpiece, Queensland, Australia\n\nSaul Goodwin / Property Shot Photography / Queensland Sotheby's International Realty\n\nOpen to the great outdoors, the main social hub of the home is situated at the centre of the structure, around an angular swimming pool. The kitchen, lounge and entertaining zones are framed by a dramatic, geometric ceiling of bisecting concrete beams.\n\nIn recent years, the property has been rebranded as the Alkira Resort House \u2013 Alkira being an indigenous word meaning bright and sunny \u2013 and it's not hard to see why. A tranquil retreat shrouded in breathtaking tropical surroundings, the residence occupies a unique position where two UNESCO World Heritage sites meet \u2013 the Daintree Rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nOtherworldly masterpiece, Queensland, Australia\n\nSaul Goodwin / Property Shot Photography / Queensland Sotheby's International Realty\n\nDesigned to be completely self-sufficient, the innovative home utilises the abundant natural resources around it. Solar panels generate electricity, while rainwater harvesting systems recycle greywater for use throughout the property.\n\nOverall, the home's grounds encapsulate nearly 74 acres (30ha), including 1,968 feet (599m) of dazzling, white-sand beachfront.\n\nThe extraordinary piece of real estate was on the market with Queensland Sotheby's International Realty in September 2024, with a guide price of over AU$7 million (\u00a33.6m/$4.8m), according to the property's agent, Lynn Malone.\n\nFlying saucer home, Pembrokeshire, UK\n\nToby / Airbnb\n\nThis UFO-style home touched down in the heart of South Pembrokeshire, UK, close to the seaside resorts of Tenby and Saundersfoot.\n\nThe modern pad looks just like the classic flying saucers from our favourite sci-fi movies, but features plenty of added home comforts, too.\n\nFlying saucer home, Pembrokeshire, UK\n\nJacob / Airbnb\n\nA remote-controlled hatch door leads inside, where a double bed and two single beds can be found \u2013 the latter of which doubles up as a sitting area.\n\nThere\u2019s also a dining area, a kitchenette and classic 1980s games, like Space Invaders and Defender, for the lucky occupant to play.\n\nLiking this?

        "article_content": "Deepak Chopra, the world-renowned author and health and wellness expert, has teamed with AI firm ElevenLabs to add his pipes to the company\u2019s roster of notable voices available for audio streaming of books, articles and other written materials.\n\nChopra\u2019s voice pact with ElevenLabs stemmed from the \u201cDigital Deepak\u201d chatbot app that he launched with the company in June. The bot is trained in Chopak\u2019s more than 90 books and numerous public appearances in order to allow people to ask him specific questions and get responses delivered back in Chopra\u2019s synthetic voice.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nLondon-based ElevenLabs has been getting attention in the entertainment industry for its work to partner with the estates of celebrities such as Judy Garland, Laurence Olivier, James Dean and Burt Reynolds to allow users to stream books, articles and other texts as read in the voices of iconic stars. ElevenLabs\u2019 deal with Chopra comes the same day that the industry-leading, Microsoft-backed OpenAI platform rolled out a host of new voices and features to its Advanced Voice Mode service.\n\nChopra\u2019s latest pact with ElevenLabs adds his distinctive voice to the roster that users can choose from when streaming audio spoken-word content. ElevenLabs has made a major effort to underscore that it has worked with estates to reach license agreements offering appropriate compensation. The company also emphasizes that its vault of celebrity voices is only available for audio streaming of written material. ElevenLabs users are not able to use those voices to create new works.\n\n\u201cI am proud to announce my partnership with ElevenLabs. Listening can help cultivate emotional\n\nnurturing and engagement. This is no different in the age of AI, it is only more important,\u201d Chopra said.\n\n\u201cI have always written to connect with people, and now I can connect on a deeper level with a global audience as I make my teachings available for everyone in my own voice.\u201d\n\nElevenLabs\u2019 outreach to the industry is an counteract the pervasive fear in Hollywood, particularly in the creative community, that AI tools will eventually pinch employment for actors, writers, directors, producers and below the line talent.\n\n\u201cAt ElevenLabs, we\u2019re committed to preserving and celebrating cultural legacies while pushing the boundaries of technology,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships for ElevenLabs. \u201cBy bringing voices like Deepak Chopra to our platform, we\u2019re not just enhancing our app \u2013 we\u2019re creating new ways for people to connect with the most influential figures and their work.\u201d\n\nMayim Bialik, actor and neuroscientist who is friendly with Chopra and closely following the growth of AI in content, added her thumbs-up for the ElevenLabs model. Actors in particular are focused in establishing the principle of compensation and consent when AI tools are employed to create new works from older material. AI concerns were at the heart of SAG-AFTRA\u2019s long strike last year and they are the key sticking point in the union\u2019s current strike against top video game publishers.\n\n\u201cDeepak has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to the mind-body connection and the significance of understanding ourselves, so it\u2019s no surprise to see him finding creative ways to leverage the latest and best in AI technology with ElevenLabs in a safe and responsible way,\u201d Bialik said. \u201cBeing able to access his content in his calm and soothing voice is a big win for his fans around\n\nthe world.\u201d\n\nElevenLabs\u2019 latest deal also comes on the heels of AI legislation being signed in to law by California Gov. Gavin Newsom. With SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher at his side, Newsom on Sept. 17 signed two bills, championed by the union, that mandates that AI and tech firms receive the consent of performers if their likeness is to be used in AI-generated new material.\n\nElevenLabs sees the California legislation as a step in the right direction to establishing guardrails around a powerful new high-tech tool that has enormous potential to revolutionize productivity and the way we live and learn, but it also comes with enormous repercussions for copyright violations and misinformation concerns. Blank told Variety he sees such legislation at the state and federal level as essential to nurturing AI business opportunities in the long run.\n\n\u201cWe welcome \u2014 and we believe the whole industry should welcome \u2014 government efforts to hold accountable bad actors who create digital replicas of someone without their consent,\u201d Blank told Variety. \u201cRecognizing that there should be accountability for abuse of technology is an important part of making technology safer while still allowing progress to thrive.\u201d\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

        "article_content": "HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post\n\nThe exponential surge in demand for AI-powered applications in recent years has necessitated a new approach to data center design, configuration and management.\n\nWall Street Journal estimates around 20% of the global data center capacity is currently used for AI purposes.\n\nHowever, with over 77% of companies already using or exploring AI technology, traditional data centers may be going obsolete \u2013 fast.\n\nThe AI stand-off\n\nDue to their complex algorithms and models, AI applications typically require more power and computing resources than others.\n\nFor example, a simple query on ChatGPT requires almost 10 times as much electricity needed to process a quick search on Google.\n\nTraditional data centers are designed with an average density of five to 10 kilowatts per rack, but this increases to 60 or more kilowatts per rack to handle AI applications.\n\nMore workload and energy demands equals higher overhead costs.\n\nIn addition, data centers have to come up with alternative and advanced ways of dealing with cooling problems, vulnerabilities, security challenges and maintenance issues that can arise due to staffing shortages.\n\nThen there is the question of environmental sustainability. Researchers estimate that GPT-3 generated over 552 tons of CO2 before it was even released for public use in 2020.\n\nThis figure is equivalent to the CO2 that would be produced by 123 gasoline vehicles over a full calendar year.\n\nUnfortunately, unless these challenges are strategically and dynamically addressed, we may be looking at an infrastructural tight-rope similar to the GPU supply deficit.\n\nThe shortage of data centers fully equipped to handle the overwhelming demands of AI technology may ultimately slow down growth, promote monopolization of AI infrastructure and have serious implications for the environment.\n\nBuilding for now and the future\n\nTo tackle these problems headlong, many companies are already implementing new measures.\n\nThese include using collocated data centers to reduce operational costs, promote scalability and ensure the availability of skilled on-site maintenance.\n\nData centers are also employing more advanced cooling techniques like liquid cooling, direct-to-chip cooling and immersive cooling, as opposed to conventional air cooling systems.\n\nFor new centers, design becomes paramount. For example, in 2022, Meta paused the construction of its $800 million data center in Texas to consider redesigning the 900,000-square-foot facility.\n\nHowever, beyond just functioning as the infrastructural and computing powerhouse for AI-backed applications and products, data centers can also leverage the same AI to optimize performance, manage costs and ensure operational efficiency in several ways.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of them.\n\nWorkload management\n\nAI and automation tools can precisely predict and allocate workloads more efficiently in data centers, ensuring that deployments match resource requirements.\n\nThis reduces waste by minimizing the under-utilization of computing hardware and reducing energy consumption. Over 32% of cloud spending is wasted mostly due to over-provisioning.\n\nAI systems, however, can redistribute resources to projects that need them the most, optimizing performance and maximizing idle hardware.\n\nRepetitive and routine tasks can be conveniently automated, saving time, energy and skilled manpower.\n\nAI can also process data and performance metrics, allowing for strategic, proactive measures to address potential workload management problems before they occur.\n\nAI-driven cooling systems\n\nIn addition to introducing better cooling facilities, AI can play a significant role in dynamically detecting and adjusting temperature.\n\nInstead of statically cooling hardware in the data center, AI can analyze and act on temperature data to supply just the needed amount of cooling to each hardware.\n\nThis can regulate humidity conditions for optimal performance, improve power efficiency and prolong the use-life of equipment.\n\nDynamic power usage effectiveness\n\nReal-time monitoring and predictive analytics by AI systems can provide key insights into power usage patterns as well as inefficiencies, allowing managers to make data-backed decisions and implement necessary power management strategies.\n\nWhile the objective fact remains that power requirements for data centers running AI workloads will always be invariably higher than traditional data centers, the synergistic efforts of AI-driven management and data center design can make a significant impact.\n\nData centers can also minimize their carbon footprint and reduce environmental impact by prioritizing efficient energy management systems and adopting power management techniques like DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling).\n\nRounding up\n\nThe price for a highly sophisticated digital future lies in the core of infrastructure.\n\nData centers must adopt physical, operational and software changes to keep up with the evolving modern world and its AI demands.\n\nThankfully, AI challenges can also be addressed with AI solutions.\n\nAs the tech industry gradually adapts and technology improves, AI-driven workload management and optimization will become mainstream, leading to robust data centers equipped to power the future.\n\nInnovation from other alternatives like decentralized computing infrastructure will also create healthy competition and improve efficiency.\n\nDaniel Keller is the CEO of InFlux Technologies.

Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nThe AI assistant is free and available to about 120,000 owners of Volkswagen\u2019s Atlas and Atlas Cross Sport models. It will roll out by early next year to other cars from model year 2020 and later.\n\nCorporate adoption of generative AI could alter the lucrative cloud computing market, where Google places third in terms of market share behind Amazon and Microsoft. Most companies are still searching for applications that users will find practical.\n\nCloud computing is a growing business segment for Google, accounting for $33 billion of the firm's $307 billion in overall revenue in 2023.\n\nAI solutions have driven billions in revenue this year, the company has said, though it declined to disclose more precise figures.\n\nVolkswagen declined to give details about usage for its AI assistant so far.\n\n(Reporting by Kenrick Cai in San Francisco; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"

The researchers published their findings Sept. 18 in the journal Nature .\n\nThe ATLAS experiment (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) is the largest detector at the LHC, and picks out the tiny subatomic particles created after beams of particles crash into each other at near light speeds.\n\n\"While particle physics is deeply rooted in quantum mechanics , the observation of quantum entanglement in a new particle system and at much higher energy than previously possible is remarkable,\" Andreas Hoecker , a spokesperson for the ATLAS experiment, said in an email statement. \"It paves the way for new investigations into this fascinating phenomenon, opening up a rich menu of exploration as our data samples continue to grow.\"\n\nParticles that are entangled have their properties connected to each other, so that a change to one instantaneously causes a change to another, even if they are separated by vast distances. Albert Einstein famously dismissed the idea as \"spooky action at a distance,\" but later experiments proved that the bizarre, locality-breaking effect is indeed real.\n\nRelated: Heaviest antimatter particle ever discovered could hold secrets to our universe's origins\n\nBut there are many aspects of entanglement that remain unexplored, and the one between quarks is one of them. This is because the subatomic particles cannot exist on their own, instead fusing together into various particle \"recipes\" called hadrons. Mixtures of three quarks are called baryons \u2014 such as the proton and the neutron \u2014 and combinations of quarks and their antimatter opposites are called mesons.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

In particular, they looked for particles whose decay products were emitted at a distinct angle that occurs only between entangled particles.\n\nBy measuring these angles and correcting for experimental effects that may have changed them, the team observed entanglement between top particles with a large enough statistical significance to be considered real. Now that the entangled particles have been spotted, the scientists say they want to study them to further probe unknown physics."

        "article_content": "Most scientists can never receive a Nobel Prize, arguably the most prestigious award in science. Only physicists, chemists, and specialists in physiology or medicine are eligible for the honor\u2014which comes with a gold medal, a diploma and currently up to 11 million Swedish kronor (about $1.07 million).\n\nMultimillionaire Alfred Nobel established the prize pot\u2014and those categories\u2014in 1895 via his last will and testament. He decreed:\n\n[My capital] is to constitute a fund, the interest on which is to be distributed annually as prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind. The interest is to be divided into five equal parts and distributed as follows: one part to the person who made the most important discovery or invention in the field of physics; one part to the person who made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who, in the field of literature, produced the most outstanding work in an idealistic direction; and one part to the person who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nThat seems straightforward. The first awards in the science categories were presented in 1901 to Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen (physics), Jacobus H. van \u2019t Hoff (chemistry) and Emil von Behring (physiology or medicine).\n\nBut the inaugural prizes in chemistry and physics honored work that traced further back in time than \u201cduring the preceding year\u201d\u2014one was connected to research that started in the 1870s and the other to research from 1895. Indeed, Scientific American calculated that between 1901 and 2023, the time between key research dates and a Nobel nod averaged 20 years across categories. And in 1902 joint winners began popping up, with Hendrik A. Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman sharing the physics prize for their work on magnetism and radiation.\n\nThat broadening of the award eligibility from Nobel\u2019s will is thanks to statutes instituted by the Nobel Foundation and his heirs in 1898. Specifically:\n\nThe provision in the will that the annual award of prizes shall be intended for works \u2018during the preceding year\u2019 should be understood in the sense that the awards shall be made for the most recent achievements in the fields of culture referred to in the will and for older works only if their significance has not become apparent until recently\u2026. A prize amount may be equally divided between two works, each of which is considered to merit a prize. If a work that is being rewarded has been produced by two or three persons, the prize shall be awarded to them jointly. In no case may a prize amount be divided between more than three persons.\n\nThe timing statute is relatively clear. Simply put, award-worthy research doesn\u2019t have to be limited to the year preceding the award. But the joint winner statute is more complicated. What does it mean?\n\nFor the science categories of physics, chemistry and physiology or medicine, up to three recipients\u2014also known as laureates\u2014can be awarded in any given year. Here\u2019s the breakdown from 1901 through 2023.\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nBut joint laureates aren\u2019t always direct collaborators. For example, James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo were awarded the 2018 prize in physiology or medicine for their research on proteins that inhibit our immune system and the way those proteins could be manipulated to fight cancer. Both contributed crucial findings to the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy, but they worked in parallel\u2014in different labs with a focus on different mechanisms.\n\nMany joint laureates aren\u2019t even contemporaries. For example, the 1986 prize in physics went to Ernst Ruska, Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer to celebrate work completed 48 years apart. Ruska developed the first electron microscope in 1933, and Binnig and Rohrer developed the scanning tunneling microscope together in 1981.\n\nAnd although each recipient is awarded their own personalized gold medal and diploma, the prize pot of money isn\u2019t necessarily evenly distributed amongst joint laureates. This can all get a little confusing\u2014unless you shift focus from the people conducting the research to the work being celebrated.\n\nPer the statute, \u201cA prize amount may be equally divided between two works, each of which is considered to merit a prize.\u201d Note the emphasis on \u201cworks.\u201d At its core, the research is being celebrated, not the researcher. Further, the statute says that \u201cif a work that is being rewarded has been produced by two or three persons, the prize shall be awarded to them jointly. In no case may a prize amount be divided between more than three persons.\u201d\n\nOverall, there are five possible scenarios:\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nHere\u2019s how it played out in 2020. The prize in physics was awarded to Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez. Penrose was celebrated, as the Nobel Foundation states, \u201cfor the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity,\u201d a contribution pinned largely to an article published in 1965 in which he established the physical foundations of black holes. Genzel and Ghez were both celebrated \u201cfor the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy\u201d\u2014work done some 25 years later in parallel, with separate teams.\n\nOne half of the prize money was awarded to Penrose, and the other half was split between Genzel and Ghez.\n\nJen Christiansen\n\nInterestingly, the statute doesn\u2019t strictly follow the language in Nobel\u2019s will. He centered the influential \u201cperson,\u201d not the \u201cwork.\u201d Even now, almost 123 years after the first ceremony, that tension doesn\u2019t feel resolved. The awards committee calls out and popularizes up to three people each year in each category and hands each of those scientists a check. Yet the awards are pinned to works, in a world in which the work being recognized is increasingly the result of many collaborators. This conflation of headlining scientist and work done by many is at the heart of many Nobel Prize critiques (although there are also other facets worthy of criticism, including a stunning and problematic lack of diversity among the laureates).\n\nAs Caroline Wagner, a scholar of science and technology with a focus on international collaboration, wrote in 2017:\n\nWhile practitioners have expanded the way contributions are credited, awards like the Nobel Prizes haven\u2019t caught up. The little bit of science history taught in school still focuses on individual contributors such as Marie Curie and Albert Einstein. Harder to explain or visualize are the cross-disciplinary collaborations that constitute most of science today.... The Nobel Prize, developed to recognize 19th-century creativity, may no longer reflect the true contributions within 21st-century science.\n\nAnd yet many people\u2014myself included\u2014are still charmed by the thought of a scientist getting caught off guard by that Nobel announcement phone call and having their routine day transformed into a spectacular one. And there\u2019s something lovely about the science communication flurry that follows, providing us all an excuse to revisit impactful research together."

This ancient seed , found between the West Bank and Israel, dates back to a time between 993 AD and 1202 and is believed to be part of a now-extinct lineage of trees mentioned in the Bible.According to reports, after taking 14 years to grow, Sheba has shown incredible medicinal potential, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties . Scientists believe the tree may be linked to the biblical \"tsori\" balm, renowned for its healing powers, and could provide valuable insights into historical remedies.With its ties to the family of myrrh and frankincense, this ancient tree offers a unique opportunity to explore both its historical significance and potential modern medical benefits.The seed was uncovered in a cave located within the Dead Sea-Jordan Rift Valley, an area known for hosting around 14.5% of its flora, with origins in the Sudanian and Sudano-Zambezian regions. This ecological zone indicates that the Commiphora species , to which the seed likely belongs, may have migrated from Africa and adapted to the region's unique climate.Phytochemical analysis of the seedling's leaves and resin revealed an absence of aromatic compounds traditionally linked to healing. However, the plant was rich in medicinal substances. This aligns with biblical references to \"tsori,\" a balm associated with healing properties. Notably, scientists identified pentacyclic triterpenoids, compounds found in other Commiphora species, which are known for their medicinal value, potentially offering therapeutic benefits, including anti-cancer properties.One of the most intriguing aspects of Sheba is its potential medicinal value. Researchers believe the tree could be the source of \"tsori,\" a balm mentioned in the Bible for its healing properties. This resin, thought to possess significant medicinal potential, has long been a part of historical and biblical accounts.The tree's close relation to the Commiphora species, which produces fragrant resins, further links it to the famous \"Balm of Gilead,\" a biblical perfume known for its therapeutic effects. Chemical analyses of Sheba\u2019s leaves have revealed compounds with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties, as well as antioxidant and skin-smoothing benefits.According to a study reported in The Economic Times, the ancient tree might hold promise in cancer treatment due to its unique properties, offering a significant opportunity for medical breakthroughs in modern research .Scientists have performed DNA, chemical, and radiocarbon analyses, confirming Sheba\u2019s relation to the family of myrrh and frankincense, both iconic biblical compounds. Despite this, the tree has not yet flowered or produced reproductive material, which limits further study on its full characteristics.The revival of Sheba raises questions about whether other ancient species might be resurrected through similar methods. While the exact species remains uncertain, researchers hope to continue exploring its lineage and uncovering its secrets.This ancient discovery offers not only a glimpse into the past but also a potential key to unlocking future medicinal breakthroughs."

        "article_content": "Archaeologists discovered a rock painting of an animal from at least 200 years ago in South Africa that may match with fossils found in the area.\n\nThe art depicts a horned serpent that may be a now-extinct creature called a dicynodont.\n\nPairing the art with fossil finds and long-standing legends from the San people has scientists eager to discern if the horned serpent\u2019s existence was a reality instead of merely legend.\n\nThere\u2019s something intriguing, even frightening, about the image of an ancient horned serpent roaming across the land. Thanks to some suggestive fossils and legends of old, talk of such a creature isn\u2019t a new concept. But the recent discovery of 200-year-old rock paintings found in South Africa now has scientists hypothesizing that this ancient creature may have been far more than just a legend.\n\nThe first formal scientific descriptions of this horned serpent\u2014a supposed member of the dicynodont group\u2014appeared in 1845. Considering the abundance of dicynodont fossils found in the Karoo Basin in South Africa, some have pondered whether this long-thought mythical horned serpent is rooted in reality. The discovery of rock art dated to between 1821 and 1835 adds even more credence to the legend, as the painting is older than the first formal reference to the dicynodont. If we\u2019re lucky, it could provide further clues as to just how intertwined this horned serpent was with South Africa\u2019s indigenous San culture.\n\nRelated Story Oldest Known Cave Paintings Show Hunting Myths\n\nIn a study published in the journal PLOS ONE, Julien Benoit from the University of the Witwatersrand confirmed that the rock art from the early 1800s depicts a tusked animal, and that it sits alongside tetrapod fossils in the immediate vicinity. \u201cAltogether,\u201d the Benoit wrote, \u201cthey suggest a case of indigenous paleontology.\u201d\n\nStill, it will need to take more than a 200-year-old painting to match a smattering of unknown fossils to a long-extinct creature unlike anything seen in the area today. \u201cThe ethnographic, archaeological, and paleontological evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that the Horned Serpent panel could possibly depict a dicynodont,\u201d Benoit wrote in the study. He added that the downward orientation of the tusks, which doesn\u2019t match any African animal (but does match dicynodonts), the abundance of fossils in the area, and the belief held by the San of the existence of this long-extinct large animal further support the theory.\n\n\u201cOf course, at this point it is speculative,\u201d said Benoit, according to IFL Science, \u201cbut the tusked animal on the Horned Serpent panel was likely painted as a rain-animal, which means it was probably involved [in] rain-making ceremonies.\u201d These ceremonies often evoked known extinct animals to help the people encourage the gods to send rain.\n\nRelated Story Fossilized Finds Buried Under L.A. High School\n\nThe San were known to have a robust mix of animals belonging to their \u2018spirit world,\u2019 but Benoit said that these animals were generally inspired by reality\u2014even if extinct. Coupled with the San\u2019s interest in fossils, Benoit believes a fossil discovery could have led the San to recreate the horned serpent, using a long-held legend in which their ancestors described the creatures as \u201cgreat monstrous brutes, exceeding the elephant or hippopotamus in bulk\u201d as the template.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of leaps from legend to scientific grounding that may be too large for a fabled horned serpent to make. But after further studies, the 200-year-old paintings could spin a different tale."

        "article_content": "The world of technology has always been dynamic and rapidly evolving, but in recent years, a powerful movement has emerged \u2014 one that puts the ability to innovate directly in the hands of individuals without requiring a technical background. This movement is known as \u201cno-code,\u201d and it is transforming how we build software, websites, and even entire businesses.\n\nNo-code tools are a game changer for women in tech, particularly those who may not have formal coding experience. This is where Women of NoCode comes in as a LinkedIn group dedicated to supporting, mentoring, and empowering women in tech through no-code solutions.\n\nThe Inspiration Behind Women of NoCode\n\nWhen creating Women of NoCode, the goal was to build a supportive and empowering community where women could gain confidence in using no-code tools to achieve their goals. The group was born to democratize access to tech innovation and provide an inclusive space where women could learn, collaborate, and elevate each other. The inspiration for the group stemmed from witnessing firsthand how no-code platforms were breaking down barriers that had historically kept women \u2014 and many others \u2014 from entering tech.\n\nTrending Peacock Spider Dances Its Way Into Our Arachnophobic Hearts\n\nThe tech industry is often dominated by people with formal coding skills, which can be intimidating to those without a programming background, but no-code solutions have changed that dynamic. These platforms allow users to build and automate processes without writing a single line of code, meaning someone with an idea can bring it to life, whether creating a mobile app, automating workflows, or developing a new website without extensive technical expertise.\n\nWomen of NoCode was created to connect women with the resources, knowledge, and community to use these tools confidently. By leveraging no-code solutions, women can bring their innovative ideas to life and challenge the notion that tech innovation is reserved for coders.\n\nSupporting Women in Tech Through Resources and Networking\n\nOne of the key pillars of the Women of NoCode group is the support it provides to women in tech through a variety of resources and networking opportunities. From curated content to expert-led discussions, the group offers a wealth of information on how to navigate the no-code landscape. Women who are just starting their tech journey and seasoned professionals alike can all find something of value in the group.\n\nNetworking plays a vital role in advancing one\u2019s career, and Women of NoCode fosters this through a community of like-minded individuals who share a passion for innovation. The group offers a platform where women can collaborate on projects, seek advice, and exchange best practices. Whether through virtual meetups, webinars, or simply engaging with posts on the LinkedIn group, members have countless opportunities to grow their network and gain insights from others in the field.\n\nWhat makes Women of NoCode unique is that it is not just a space to talk about tools and platforms but a space to celebrate women\u2019s achievements in tech. Every success story shared within the group serves as a reminder of what women are capable of when given the right tools and opportunities. These stories help inspire others, fostering a ripple effect of empowerment across the community.\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the no-code movement is how it democratizes access to tech. In the past, building a software application or automating business processes required either hiring a developer or learning to code \u2014 both of which are traditionally costly and time-consuming. No-code platforms have changed that, making it possible for anyone, regardless of their background, to become a creator in the tech space.\n\nFor women, this is particularly empowering. Studies show that women are still underrepresented in many technical fields, often due to a lack of access to the necessary training or mentorship. No-code platforms offer a way to bridge this gap by enabling women to acquire tech skills without writing code or requiring programming skills.\n\nThrough Women of NoCode, women are discovering how to leverage no-code tools to solve real-world problems, launch new businesses, and innovate within their existing roles. The accessibility of these tools means that more women can enter the tech industry, contribute to digital transformation, and bring important and unique perspectives to the table.\n\nNo-code solutions also help to level the playing field for entrepreneurs.

Madeline Clarke, writing for TechRepublic Premium, presents this resource on SaaS to educate readers on the cloud-based software model, its pros and cons, and how this trend may shape the future of enterprise software.\n\nFeatured text from the download: FORMS OF APPLICATIONS SaaS applications can serve a range of purposes, typically depending on the type of business that will be utilizing them. But to understand the various forms, you should first know the difference between horizontal and vertical SaaS. Vertical SaaS: Applications are typically geared more toward a specific business sector or type of organization. Its features are fine-tuned to meet the needs of those industries and tend to be more customizable and attuned to the unique needs of the market it is servicing. A SaaS application that manages patient appointments would be an example of a vertical SaaS used by businesses in the healthcare industry. Horizontal SaaS: Applications can be used by companies across multiple industries, as their capabilities are applicable across many business settings. For example, SaaS solutions that manage customer relationships or provide team productivity tools would be considered horizontal SaaS applications.\n\nStrengthen your SaaS knowledge with our in-depth 10-page PDF.

Throughout this 30-plus minute show, Sony and its third-party partners showcased over 20 games coming to PlayStation 5 and PSVR2 in the coming months. We got a new look at PS5 games like Lego Horizon Adventures and Monster Hunter Wilds, as well as some exciting new announcements such as Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered , which was leaked by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), and the Ghost of Tsushima sequel Ghost of Y\u014dtei.\n\nWe also got to see some more games that will run on PS5 Pro hardware (its set to release this November). September\u2019s State of Play was a big one PlayStation fans, so there\u2019s a lot to keep track of. To help, we\u2019ve rounded up everything announced during this State of Play.\n\nAstro Bot is getting a major update this fall\n\nAstro Bot - Speedrun and Special Bots Add-On Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nTo kick off the State of Play, we learned that Team Asobi\u2019s critical darling Astro Bot will be getting a significant update. It will add five new online speedrun levels and 10 new bots based on games like Helldivers 2 and Stellar Blade. This new content for Astro Bot will be entirely free and launch sometime this fall on the PS5.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nPalworld is out now on PS5\n\nPalworld - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nPalworld launched on PC and Xbox Series X/S and became a viral success early this year. That happened because the game had the cute creature-collecting elements of Pokemon, but was also extremely violent, like most survival games. In fact, it may be a little too similar to Pokemon, as Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are suing developer Pocketpair. That\u2019s not stopping them from bringing Palworld to more platforms, as it surprise launched on PS5 during tonight\u2019s State of Play.\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds is out next February\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds - Release Date Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nMonster Hunter Wilds got a new trailer during this State of Play. It showed us some more story cutscenes, a new jungle-like biome, and some threatening new monsters that players will have to fight in the game, like the White Wraith. We also saw Felynes in action in Monster Hunter Wilds for the first time. Most importantly, we finally got a release date for this long-awaited Capcom game. Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on February 28, 2025.\n\nLego Horizon Adventures is out in November\n\nLEGO Horizon Adventures - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nLego Horizon Adventures was revealed in June, but still had no release date. That finally changed today as a new trailer confirmed that Lego Horizon Adventures will be released for PC, PS5, and Nintendo Switch on November 14. That lines up with a previously leaked release date for the title. Its new trailer reaffirmed the core concept of the game: it is a kid-friendly, Lego-fied reimagining of the story of Horizon Zero Dawn that isn\u2019t afraid to break canon with costumes based on other PlayStation characters like Sackboy or Ratchet & Clank.\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn Remastered is launching sooner than you think\n\nHorizon Zero Dawn Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 & PC Games\n\nEarlier in the month, an ESRB listing revealed the existence of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. Following in the footsteps of similar treatments for the two The Last of Us games, this is a refurbishment of a bestselling PS4 game for Sony\u2019s current platform. The reveal trailer highlights the improved visuals and over 10 hours of rerecorded dialogue. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will be released on October 31, which is much sooner than expected. It will be available across PS5 and PC and will only cost $10 for those who own the original.\n\nGhost of Y\u014dtei is Sucker Punch Productions\u2019 next game\n\nGhost of Y\u014dtei - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games\n\nTo close out the show, Sucker Punch Productions surprised us by revealing Ghost of Y\u014dtei, a sequel to 2020\u2019s critically acclaimed Ghost of Tsushima. It follows a new \u201cghost\u201d named Atsu, and takes place around Mount Y\u014dtei in Northern Japan. It also takes place in 1603, which is hundreds of years after Ghost of Tsushima, which is known for its gorgeous vistas and industry-leading visuals. Ghost of Y\u014dtei is shaping up to be very much the same. It will be released exclusively for PS5 sometime in 2025.\n\nEverything else"
