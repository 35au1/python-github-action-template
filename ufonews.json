Learn More.\n\nGoogle is set to unleash the power of Gemini with upgraded capabilities when it launches Android 16 for the consumer market next year. In this version, the AI assistant becomes an agent that does things for the human user. A new API introduced to Google\u2019s Developers page allows the AI assistant to perform actions inside the phone\u2019s apps on behalf of the users, a huge improvement that can automate hundreds of daily phone activities.\n\nThe AI assistant will play a bigger role as it transitions to its next generation of becoming agentic, which uses reasoning and planning to solve complex problems on its own. When put in a smartphone, it could potentially revolutionize user experience.\n\nHeavy Speculation About Agentic AI\n\nGoogle released Android 16 for developers in November, sparking an air of mystery and speculation about the new feature for its AI assistant. The \u201capp function\u201d feature likely provides Gemini capabilities to automate daily phone activities with little to no human intervention.\n\nGoogle explains the \u201capp function\u201d as \u201ca specific piece of functionality that an app offers to the system,\u201d adding that \u201cthese functionalities can be integrated into various system features.\u201d It will let \u201capplications \u2026 execute functions they define.\u201d\n\nThis means Gemini can execute a specific function of an application when triggered or called upon by the system, as long as such a function is \u201cregistered and made available.\u201d In other words, Gemini can shop online using the phone\u2019s app with very little or no intervention from the user. For example, an \u201corderFood\u201d function lets the AI assistant do the job without the need for the user to open a food delivery service app to order pizza.\n\nGemini is currently the default AI assistant for most Android phones and devices. However, the upgraded Gemini would be more than just an AI assistant that interacts with phone apps and external services\u2014giving it the capacity to control the functions inside the applications on behalf of the phone\u2019s user adds a hefty measure of utility and power to smartphones."

            "article_content": "MA Ganapathy (File photo)\n\nNEW DELHI: When laying hands on a book penned by a recently retired IPS officer, you would normally expect tales of gallantry, security strategy insights and, even better, some inside and juicy details of investigations into high-profile cases that can possibly generate enough media interest to get the memoirs flying off the shelves.But M A Ganapathy \u2014 who hung up his boots earlier this year after discharging key roles as DG, NSG and Uttarakhand DGP as well as earlier stints in the CBI, Union home ministry and Central police organisations \u2014 in his debut novel \u2018 Whispers in the Shadows \u2019, a collection of short stories , has chosen to go with the paranormal rather than normal. With the government of India having tightened rules to rein in bureaucrats\u2019 post-retirement \u201ckiss and tell\u201d memoirs, Ganapathy has steered clear of making his literary foray with a first-person account in James Bond-style and dabbled instead in Ruskin Bond \u2019s much-loved art of narrating \u2018spooky events and paranormal encounters \u2019 set in the woods and quaint Indian towns.Taking a cue from the Uttarakhand-based celebrity author, Ganapathy in \u2018Whispers in the Shadows\u2019 (mind you, not \u2018Whispers in the Corridors\u2019, which would anyday be a more awaited offering from an ex-bureaucrat), puts together hair-raising and captivating tales set in UP/Uttarakhand, Ganapathy a.k.a. Avinash\u2019s cadre state; his native home in the coffee haven of Coorg set in the Western Ghats; his alma mater JNU (not named in the book) and even his Central postings in CISF and as head of Bureau of Civil Aviation and Security (BCAS).It could thus not be more apt that \u2018the\u2019 Ruskin Bond himself introduces \u2018Whispers in the Shadows\u2019 on the cover as \u201ccompelling, intriguing and genuine\u201d.Ganpathy stars in and as Avinash, a protagonist he has cleverly created to narrate his rather frequent brushes with the supernatural. There are enough giveaways: Avinash, like Ganapathy, is a native of Coorg, or Kodagu. The stories \u2018Shriek in the Woods\u2019 and \u2018Babu\u2019s Hurricane Lamp\u2019 may remind you or your own childhood \u2014 the fear of Maths, walks from the school through the haunted woods and spooky stories fed to wide-eyed children by the househelps \u2014 and have a flash of R K Narayan\u2019s \u2018Swami\u2019 from Malgudi Days.Each of the tales has Avinash narrating his weird, ghostly, time-travel and post-death experiences in a lucid but captivating, edge-of-the-seat style. The book is a window to the life of a senior police officer who is trained to be fearless and rely on scientific evidence but who is also human enough to marvel at and embrace the unexplained, supernatural experiences along the way. So much so, Ganapathy made it a point to chronicle these chilling life incidents and produce a novel soon after he retired.The stories may be intriguing, sometimes rather incredible (particularly The Curious Case of Class of 1986, which sees Avinash travel through different realms of time), but they also carry a message. The ghosts and supernatural entities, including dead dogs, seem to help in solving knotty murder cases (The Uncanny Experience in Behta Village and Little Khairi Still Roams the Wilds), save lives (Do Miracles Really Happen Anymore and The Small Boy Who Loved Airports) and ensure that the forests and wildlife are protected (Bote Aiyappa of the Sacred Grove)."

            "article_content": "It may not have won \u201cWord of the Year,\u201d but romantasy is still the reigning champion of many readers' hearts.\n\nAlex Belanger shares her romantasy recommendations with more than 16,000 followers on TikTok. Because the 31-year-old Kentuckian grew up in a sheltered religious sect, she's always been drawn to \u201cRapunzel\u201d stories. Fairytales about broadening worldviews and unexplored places were a childhood comfort. During the pandemic, she stumbled into romantasy books on TikTok, and found they both reminded her of her youth and reflected her interests as an adult.\n\nBelanger is just one of the many readers steering one of publishing's prized horses \u2013 the genre's sales increased 42% from 2022 to 2023, according to Circana.\n\nWhat is romantasy?\n\nA portmanteau of the words \u201cromance\u201d and \u201cfantasy,\u201d romantasy blends two beloved genres. Readers get all the best parts of swoony love story tropes, magical world-building and high-stakes adventure.\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\nMany romantasy books include fae or fairies, dragons, elves and other mythical creatures. Popular series \u201cA Court of Thorns and Roses\u201d by Sarah J. Maas is a \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d retelling set in a divided realm of humans and faeries. \u201cFourth Wing\u201d by Rebecca Yarros, another romantasy favorite, follows a young girl training to become a dragon rider.\n\nThe world-building is more expansive than many other romance subgenres. In paranormal romance, for example, magical characters often appear in normal society rather than in an entirely new, imagined land.\n\nBut the two genres often overlap, especially with their readership. Ali Hazelwood\u2019s \u201cBride,\u201d which features a romance between a vampire and werewolf, was a recent hit with romantasy fans.\n\n\u201cThe blurring of these lines is just exciting and expansive and allows authors and publishers to have a greater diversification of contents, of character,\u201d says Ashley Doliber, the senior director of marketing strategy at Entangled Publishing, which houses such series as Rebecca Yarros' \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Obsidian\" by Jennifer L. Armentrout. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to color within certain lines, you have the opportunity to really push those boundaries.\u201d\n\nIs romantasy the right genre for you?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a fantasy fanatic to get in on the fun. Many readers credit romantasy series like \u201cACOTAR\u201d as the reason they got back into reading, even if they were initially hesitant to try the genre. And despite their length, they tend to be fast-paced, immersive reads.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to choose from, which keeps the genre fresh, says Belanger. She recommends switching up the tropes and types of mythical beings in your books. Worlds inhabited by fairies or dragons are among the most popular, but she's recently seen an uptick in \u201cshifter\u201d protagonists, who, as the name suggests, can morph between human and animal forms.\n\nRomantasy is also the perfect genre for those who grew up reading fan fiction.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to find a lot of the people that write romantasy are the people that wrote fan fiction in the past,\u201d Belanger says.\n\nJulie Soto, author of \u201cRose in Chains,\u201d used to write \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fan fiction. Hazelwood\u2019s \u201cThe Love Hypothesis\u201d was originally published online as \u201cReylo\u201d fan fiction (yes \u2013 as in Rey and Kylo Ren from \u201cStar Wars\u201d).\n\nMore than just \u2018spicy\u2019: Readers find romantasy empowering\n\nThere\u2019s something so unputdownable about stepping into a magical world and finding your OTP (one true pairing).\n\nSteamy romance novels are sometimes seen as the fluff of the literary world. Society has long been quick to invalidate female sexuality and empowerment as \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d reads.\n\n\u201cThat escapism aspect is certainly key,\u201d Doliber says. \u201cBut I think what a lot of genre fiction allows is the opportunity to simultaneously have that fun, joyful, thought-provoking escapism (and) at the same time, you\u2019re tackling real-world themes\u201d like female empowerment and agency.\n\nIt\u2019s also one corner of the internet where readers have been able to embrace their sexuality and center female pleasure. Some readers told HuffPost that romance books and erotica have helped improve their sex lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really great way to help your mind become open and break away from purity culture,\u201d Belanger says. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in a woman\u2019s pleasure and knowing what you want.\u201d\n\nBest romantasy books\n\nRomantasy may be buzzy, but it\u2019s not a new genre. Belanger cites \"foundational\" romantasy reads (which, in the 2010s, were more medieval than fae) like Mary E. Pearson\u2019s \u201cThe Remnant Chronicles\u201d and Marissa Meyer\u2019s fairytale retellings in \u201cThe Lunar Chronicles.\u201d\n\nModern classics include Sarah J. Maas' three bestselling romantasy series \"A Court of Thorns and Roses,\" \"Throne of Glass\" and \"Crescent City.\" Rebecca Yarros is another big name in romantasy with \"Fourth Wing,\" \"Iron Flame\" and her upcoming \"Onyx Storm,\" which releases in January.\n\nIf you want to dive into the romantasy genre, here are the titles Belanger suggests starting with:\n\n\u201cA River Enchanted\u201d by Rebecca Ross\n\n\u201cHouse of Dragons\u201d by K.A. Linde\n\n\u201cSong of the Forever Rains\u201d by E.J. Mellow\n\n\u201cA Court this Cruel and Lovely\u201d by Stacia Stark\n\n\u201cFor the Wolf\u201d by Hannah Whitten\n\n\u201cThe Bridge Kingdom\u201d by Danielle L.

Caggiano\n\n\u201cA Fate Inked in Blood\u201d by Danielle L. Jensen\n\n\u201cBelladonna\u201d by Adalyn Grace (YA)\n\n\u201cSinner\u2019s Isle\u201d by Angela Montoya (YA)\n\n\u201cAn Enchantment of Ravens\u201d by Margaret Rogerson (YA)\n\n\u201cA Curse So Dark and Lonely\u201d by Brigid Kemmerer (YA)\n\n\u201cThe Shadows Between Us\u201d by Tricia Levenseller (YA)\n\n\u201cImmortal Dark\u201d by Tigest Girma (YA)\n\nAnd here are some favorites from USA TODAY staff:\n\n\u201cFrom Blood and Ash\u201d Jennifer L. Armentrout\n\n\u201cThese Hollow Vows\u201d Lexi Ryan\n\n\u201cHouse of Beating Wings\u201d Olivia Wildenstein\n\n\u201cThe Serpent and the Wings of Night\u201d Carissa Broadbent\n\n\u201cDivine Rivals\u201d Rebecca Ross\n\n\u201cSpark of the Everflame\u201d Penn Cole\n\nNot the right fit for you?

These locations are usually fascinating places full of wonder, but sometimes they can hide something far more sinister.\n\nEvery now and then, a game can feature an eerie-looking place that hides an even more disturbing secret. Coming across a location like this can be pretty creepy on its own, but if you dare to delve deeper into its mysteries, the degree of fear can reach critical levels.\n\nAlthough a game you play may appear nice and innocent, it can also contain an unresolved murder mystery, a secret monster, or a terrifying story of cosmic proportions in its darkest and scariest corners.\n\nThe discovery of such a place can send you down a deep rabbit hole that will change your perspective on the world of the game and make you wonder if it really is what it claims to be.\n\nIf you're not afraid to poke around creepy places and uncover their dark secrets, the following list will pique your curiosity. Otherwise, you might want to steer clear of the locales and the mysteries we're about to unravel."

            "article_content": "Charming and ebullient, Ducotterd does not fit the stereotype of a research scientist. She grew up in Wigan, and her accent has survived long years abroad. Like many involved in dementia research, she has a personal connection to the disease. With a dentist father and social worker mother, Ducotterd initially planned to become a vet, but when she didn\u2019t get into veterinary school she studied biology at the University of Edinburgh instead. Around the same time, her grandmother\u2019s mental state began to decline.\n\n\u201cI was watching my granny start to buy food for people who didn\u2019t live with her anymore and forget big details about her life,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving that personal connection to the story made me so motivated by what I was doing in the lab. I thought: this is exactly what I want to do. Make medicines.\u201d She went on to a PhD at Newcastle. In the face of diminished neuroscience investment in the UK, she moved to Japan for a postdoctoral position studying Parkinson\u2019s disease. Later she worked at GSK in China and later at Eisai Pharmaceuticals in the USA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an amazingly global experience of drug discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to be innovative you have to think differently. And the more different ways of thinking you have in your group, the more you\u2019re going to challenge each other.\u201d\n\nShe ended up staying in America for nine years, before moving back to the UK at the end of 2022, by which time she had acquired a husband and a daughter. While she had been away, Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK had taken the lead in establishing new Drug Discovery Institutes at Oxford, Cambridge and in London, enabling them to function like biotech startups in a university setting, adding free-market pep to academic excellence.\n\nSince Ducotterd was an undergraduate, there has been revolutionary progress in neurodegenerative diseases, mostly driven by advances in computing.\n\n\u201cI went to university just after they\u2019d cloned Dolly the sheep,\u201d she says. \u201cThe molecular technologies have transformed the field \u2013 being able to sequence genomes in minutes rather than years; methods that let us do more rapid analysis of big data; artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u201d\n\nThe success of lecanemab, a drug that has been shown to slow Alzheimer\u2019s progression by 30 per cent in early-stage patients (but which has yet to be approved on the NHS) has also energised the field by showing that progress is possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never seen a trial that has shown we can slow the disease at all. It gives massive amounts of hope and investment because everyone now knows it is possible.\u201d\n\nOne of the projects she is particularly excited about involves leveraging human genetics to mimic natural resilience against dementia. \u201cThere is a really interesting study in a group in Holland where they\u2019re looking at people who live healthily into their hundreds cognitively,\u201d she says."

This state of matter also has properties that mimic how light and particles interact in the universe.\n\nHowever, proving the theory has, until now, proved very challenging. To this end, the international team developed advanced experiments (like neutron-scattering) and theoretical models to attempt to observe this state of matter for the first time.\n\nAnd, by all accounts, they appear to have been successful.\n\nA major breakthrough\n\n\u201cFractional matter quasiparticles, long theorized in quantum spin liquids, required significant advancements in experimental resolution to be convincingly tested in this type of material,\u201d said Romain Sibille, the experimental team leader at Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland."

However, the platform is also home to a sea of content that isn\u2019t safe for children, which is why a dedicated kids\u2019 experience has been there for a while.\n\nNow, YouTube is adding a password protocol that will keep young users from accessing any other profile apart from their designated kid\u2019s profile on a TV. In a community update, the company introduced the new Parent Code feature that will block kids from accessing user profiles for adults in their household.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIt is an opt-in feature that needs to be enabled manually. Once activated, this code will be required if kids want to access a profile meant for other members of their family. Moreover, they will also be prompted to enter the code if they want to access the video platform without any Google account signed in.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nGoing a step further, the team will also require the parent code if an individual attempts to remove an account from the shared TV. YouTube has also clarified that enabling the new feature won\u2019t affect other devices on which the same account is being used.\n\nIn order to enable the Parent code feature, follow this path:\n\nIn the YouTube app installed on your TV, navigate to the Settings page. You will see a dedicated Parent Code tab in the Settings dashboard. Go through the on-screen prompts and set up the four-digit Parent Code. In order to disable the safety feature, you need to enter the same code in the future.\n\nDo keep in mind that once you remove the parent code, anyone can enjoy YouTube sans any age restrictions for content and without having to sign up with a Google account. Moreover, all user profiles belonging to adult members will be openly accessible.\n\nThe latest safety-focused feature update from YouTube is actually a corrective measure on the company\u2019s end. Earlier this year, Google pulled away the separate YouTube Kids app icon in the YouTube experience for TVs and smart devices.\n\nInstead, the profiles for kids and adults were all clubbed together under the \u201cWho\u2019s watching\u201d launch banner. \u201cNow, you can easily select your child\u2019s profile from within the YouTube app, and you\u2019ll be brought right into the new YouTube Kids experience on TV,\u201d the company reasoned back then.\n\nHowever, it seems that not all parents and guardians were happy with the move, apparently because it makes it far easier for kids to access other user profiles that show content without any age restrictions. Locking non-kids profiles behind a passcode is a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Parent Code feature on YouTube is now rolling out and will start appearing for all users within the next few days."

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nThe case of Subhash Atul's suicide has highlighted numerous issues in alleged misuse of law sections such as Section 498A and 306 of the Indian Penal Code, IPC. The original legislation was meant to safeguard distressed women against dowry harassment and associated abuse but its misuse led to serious persecutions for the accused, their families, and social groups. Subhash Atul, a Pune-based software engineer, was found dead under mysterious circumstances. Reports indicated continuous harassment by his spouse as an alleged cause of his distress.\n\nHis death reignited a nationwide debate on gender-neutrality in laws as well as the psychological pressure such allegations can put the accused under. The legal framework governing these cases reflects the delicate balance between protecting vulnerable individuals and ensuring fairness in the justice system. Section 498A of the IPC addresses cruelty by a husband or his relatives, while Section 306 deals with abetment of suicide.\n\nHowever, an increasing number of evidence points to the possibility of false cases under these acts, which leads to unnecessary legal tangles, loss of reputation, and even suicides by the accused. Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) are alarming: more than 70% of cases filed under Section 498A end in acquittal, which questions the validity of such cases and calls for reforms. Discussions around gender-neutral laws have been gathering steam worldwide, and countries like the UK and Canada have implemented frameworks addressing domestic abuse without any form of discrimination on the basis of gender.\n\nIn India, although the judiciary has intervened in many cases to prevent misuse, there is a great need for a thorough review of existing laws to balance protection for the vulnerable and the exploitation of legal provisions. This article explores the complexities in the Subhash Atul case, examines landmark judgments on husbands accused under Sections 498A and 306, analyzes statistical trends, and proposes policy reforms to these challenges.\n\nThe psychological and social implications of false allegations cannot be ignored. Most people accused under these sections suffer social ostracization, financial loss, and disconnection from their families well before a judgment is pronounced.\n\nThe case of Subhash Atul is the epitome of how false accusations at times can bring about devastating effects not just on the person being framed but also on his dear ones. The death signals a grim reminder of systematic changes that will ensure justice from all sides. This article seeks to understand thoroughly the Subhash Atul case, contextualize this within the larger framework of Indian and international legal systems, and try to come up with pragmatic solutions that can help work through issues arising from an abuse of these laws. This article, with careful case studies, judicial pronouncements, and analysis of statistical data, will attempt to throw light upon the various dimensions of this burning issue and plead for reforms that are equitable and just.\n\nThe path of legal reform is long and arduous, but a more balanced and equitable system can be achieved with informed discourse and judicial activism. Shubhash Atul Suicide Case\n\nOverview\n\nThe Shubhash Atul case is a grim reminder of how the misuse of legal provisions can result in devastating consequences. Shubhash, a 34-year-old software engineer, was involved in a contentious marital dispute. According to reports, his wife and her family demanded exorbitant sums of money under the guise of alimony and maintenance. When Shubhash refused to oblige to these demands, they reportedly threatened to file false complaints of dowry harassment under Section 498A IPC. The mental torture and social stigma with such allegations compelled Shubhash to take the extreme step of ending his life. The case throws light on several systemic issues.\n\nPrimarily, it highlights the insufficient safeguards against the misuse of Section 498A. Where the law was initially conceived to protect women from cruelty, its implementation is shoddy, and hence many innocent people get implicated. Second, the case highlights the stigma and mental health issues faced by men who are accused of dowry harassment. Unlike women-centric support systems, men often lack counselling and legal aid, which makes them feel more isolated and hopeless.\n\nThis case is not an isolated incident. Recent times have seen several men go through similar ordeals that could have been well averted with timely intervention and balanced legal approaches leading to suicides. Critics assert that laws like Section 498A, enacted with great intent to safeguard women against abuse, have been wrongly misused and have therefore resulted in undue harassment of innocent people. The case requires a critical look at the implementation of such provisions and more accountability towards the misusers. The role of the media in shaping public perception must not be forgotten.\n\nSensationalised coverage of marital disputes often tends to demonise one party without providing both sides of the story. At first, reports about the case were all about allegations against Shubhash rather than the extortion attempts being made on him. Single-sided stories contribute to this stigma and social ostracisation, forcing the accused to take more extreme measures. It involves legislative reforms, judicial intervention, and public awareness so that these issues are attended to.\n\nA culture of accountability and empathy can be bred in society so that these laws like Section 498A are meant to be followed and not used to harass. This case has sparked debate surrounding the need for gender-neutral law. Advocates have cited that a more comprehensive framework of law would address the reality of modern marital disputes appropriately. Such reforms would provide protection to real victims besides deterring any misuse at the hands of the offender.\n\nStatistics on Section 498A and Related Cases\n\nThus the concept of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code was devised with a high-minded ideal of safeguarding women against cruelty from their husbands or other related members. It has progressed many years, but controversies have sparked how misused it has been and the consequences for the innocents charged. An examination of closer views of statistics shows a comprehensive story of misuse and fault in the system.\n\nIncreasing Number of Cases\n\nWe can see that the cases registered under Section 498A rose sharply between 2010 and 2022. Cases reported rose from around 1,20,000 in the year 2010 to nearly 1,48,000 in 2022. This may also be symptomatic of an increasing awareness regarding legal rights and avenues available to redress among women. Critics suggest that this trend also goes to indicate the increasing misuse of the law when accusations made are often more a vehicle for personal vendettas.\n\nIn stark contrast to the increasing trend, the conviction rate under Section 498A depicts a totally different scenario. In relation to the conviction rate, it has slowly declined to 18 in 2011 and has reached 14.3 in the year 2021. The stark contrast between two numbers raises many questions with regard to the genuineness of many complaints, so the judiciary finds the task of separating wheat from corn very difficult.\n\nBelow are graphical representations of the trends:\n\nHuman Costs: Suicides by Married Men\n\nAnother silent victim of misuse of domestic violence laws is the psychological trauma upon the accused or married men. In an article in 2021, it has been claimed that a substantial number of cases of suicides among married men in India arise out of mere false accusations or disputes concerning marriage. Health reasons stand at 33% as grounds for suicide, followed by a financial crisis in 23%, marital dispute at 14%, and others being 30%. These numbers tell a rather macabre story of the emotional and psychological cost false accusations may inflict.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost menacing though is the trend given out by the data released by the National Crime Records Bureau: The suicide rates amongst married men are higher than those of women who are also married. It is being claimed, it is alleged, falsely no doubt, by wives to put husbands in depression-and-sometimes-suicide-or-tragedy by filing an action under Section 498A.\n\nInternational Comparisons: False Allegations in Domestic Violence Cases\n\nThis problem of false allegations is not limited to India. It has been noticed that this problem of misuse of domestic violence laws is also increasing in the world. According to some research, it has been estimated that around 25% of cases in India are based on false allegations. Rates in other countries are much lower: the USA reports 12%, Canada 8%, and the UK 10%.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese statistics definitely demand a more subdued approach toward the domestic violence laws. Being adequate with the legal protection for the true victims, there must be a mechanism that does not allow frivolous misuse of such laws. Most countries, including both the USA and UK, have offered penal provisions in case of frivolous complaints, and India must follow this precedent for consideration.\n\nSocial and Legal Implications\n\nThe statistics actually tell the story of empowerment as well as exploitation. It would speak well for improving access to justice and increased willingness on the part of the women to oppose the crimes as the numbers of Section 498A cases increased. However, in a wider perspective, dwindling cases of conviction as well as increasing misuse call for reformation.\n\nThe judiciary has not remained a silent spectator either. Several landmark judgements from the Supreme Court of India have highlighted that the scrutiny over Section 498A needs to be very stringent. It has further directed the police not to adopt automatic arrests but to have due diligence while investigating a case.\n\nSome of the landmark judgments include Rajesh Sharma & Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh in 2017. The Supreme Court issued a series of directives in the judgment to restrain misuse of Section 498A. It also shifted the preliminary examination burden of the family welfare committee before taking legal action. This resulted in reduced frivolous litigation and ensuring that actual grievances were dealt with properly.\n\nCharting the way forward\n\nAbusing Section 498A, its provision-cum-sister provisions prove somewhat more onerous. Legal changes needed should be such that they provide necessary protections to genuine victims vis-\u00e0-vis the rights of the accused for their false implication. Massive media campaigns can also come up to educate the world to avoid false complaints through these provisions and thus induce the culture of accountability for its own sake and towards each other.\n\nIn the final analysis, statistics remind us that justice must be blind and that justice should be just, that the law should act as a shield for the weak and not as a tool of exploitation.\n\nCase Laws and Court Decisions\n\nSections 498A (Dowry harassment) and 306 (Abetment of suicide) have been of tremendous utility for the past all these years while dealing with sensitive cases related to marital disputes, dowry harassment, and suicides. The said sections were essentially designed to save women from domestic cruelty and protect the dignity of those suffering under abusive relationships.\n\nHowever, the wrong use or misuse of these sections has given many husbands the wrong implication in the judicial system. A few landmark judicial precedents have given great insight into how these laws should be applied. It has been mainly aimed at protecting innocent people from false accusations. Some of the important cases and judgements are given below that have helped shape the interpretation of Section 498A and Section 306.\n\nArnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar (2014)\n\nThe case of Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar turned out to be a landmark decision when the Supreme Court realised the misuse of Section 498A was gaining momentum. In said case, the wife alleged mental cruelty and dowry harassment against her husband, and the court found that the allegations were vague.\n\nIn this, the High Court came down with the stringent mandates to the police to investigate before filing an arrest in the case against the person under Section 498A. It decried that grossly is misused and frivolous arrest takes place over the innocents under flimsy allegations.\n\nThe Supreme Court has clarified that under Section 498A, the arrest is required only if prima facie evidence of cruelty or harassment is found. It has brought to the fore that such false accusations are not rare and ushered in the importance of ensuring fairness in such cases. This judgement has led to the formation of guidelines to prevent such unwarranted arrests wherein the innocuous husbands and his families were dragged into legal proceedings without substantial grounds.\n\nState of Maharashtra v. Suresh\n\nState of Maharashtra v. Suresh involved a tragic female suicide where her husband had been convicted under Section 306 for abetment of suicide. The family of the wife produced in court that she had undergone mental torture from her husband, and due to it, she committed suicide to such an extent. However, the Bombay High Court held that there was no evidence to prove that direct nexus was between the act of the husband and suicide. Generalised allegations regarding cruelty are not enough for availing Section 306 held by the High Courts of India.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the judgement with the contention that Section 306 should be brought into play only where evidence would show a direct link between the acts of the accused and the decision to commit suicide by the victim. It said that mental cruelty cannot result in suicide and also that it cannot be misconstrued so as to involve a person without there being satisfactory proof. It worked as a judgment that hindered the misuse of the Section 306 in the manner that no person be falsely charged without there having been proof of intentional abetment.\n\nS. R. Batra v. State of U.P. (2005)\n\nThe case of S. R. Batra v. State of U.P. involves the issue of holding the husband liable for mental cruelty under Section 498A on the ground that he let his wife claim to have been subjected to emotional abuse and ill-treatment. The Supreme Court held that mere facts that marital relationships may meet with some kind of difficulty do not amount to mental cruelty under Section 498A. The Court further stated that the nature of mental cruelty should be such as to cause grave emotional distress that leads to serious harm for the victim.\n\nThis judgement has turned out to be a landmark precedent wherein Section 498A could not be invoked for each and every marital dispute, but only when allegations of cruelty were supported by substantial evidence. The Court had made it clear that mere marital discord cannot be considered justification for invoking legal provisions for the reason that emotional issues would always crop up during relations, but these do not have to necessarily amount to criminal behavior. This judgement repeated the proposition that mental cruelty has to be intentional, persistent, and grave so that it can affect the mental health and well-being of the victim.\n\nKey Impact and Judicial Guidelines\n\nThrough these case studies, the courts have consistently sought to balance the protection of victims and the protection of innocent individuals from wrongful accusations. The rulings of the Supreme Court and various High Courts have set important guidelines for proper investigation and evaluation of evidence before charges under Section 498A or Section 306 are brought. They emphasize the need for precautionary measures such as preliminary inquiries, clear evidence, and substantive proof before proceeding with accusations that can deeply affect a person\u2019s life and reputation.\n\nThese judicial precedents have made it clear that false claims under these provisions will not be tolerated, and that the legal process must be fair and equitable. They aim to ensure that the law serves its true purpose \u2014 to protect victims of domestic violence and suicide abetment while also safeguarding against abuse of the legal system by malicious or vindictive individuals.\n\nKey Judicial Rulings Supporting Men in False Accusation Cases\n\nIndian courts have dealt extensively with improper usage of the laws such as Section 498A and 306 IPC. Some landmark rulings have not only provided relief to harassed spouses who were wrongfully accused, but they have also established significant precedents for similar instances in the future. In Sushil Kumar Sharma v. Union of India, decided in 2005, the Supreme Court recognized the misuse of Section 498A and demanded protections against baseless charges.\n\nAnother notable case in which the Supreme Court ordered the cessation of arbitrary arrests under Section 498A was Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar (2014). Before acting, the magistrates and police officers had to thoroughly examine the complaints.\n\nThese guidelines have significantly curtailed the misuse of this provision, although some issues still persist.\n\nAdditionally, the High Courts have rendered a number of decisions in support of wives who are the targets of false claims. The Bombay High Court, for instance, emphasized the necessity for legislative reform in Preeti Gupta v. State of Jharkhand (2010) to address the misuse of Section 498A, highlighting the psychological pain suffered by families falsely accused of dowry harassment without adequate evidence.\n\nThe Supreme Court provided some extra guidelines in Rajesh Sharma v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2017) to help stop Section 498A from being misused. It recommended formation of family welfare committees to make a preliminary analysis of the complaints before the courts admit them. This would also give an impartial assessment to the allegations made, hence the chances of false cases reaching the court would become very low.\n\nIn such cases, the courts strive hard to ensure equal justice for both parties, and more can be done by the judiciary to ensure the rights of all parties concerned are preserved without compromising the law's integrity. More to that, these judgments imply more than individual cases. It sets precedents for later litigations and the judiciary's intent to ensure justice in a manner that would not compromise before social or political pressures. This ensures that the legal system continues to remain a haven for all regardless of gender.\n\nLegal Provisions and Safeguards Against False Claims\n\nIn the context of Shubhansh Atul suicide, false accusations or claims may really misorient the process of judiciary as well as harm people, their respective reputations in society.\n\nIndian law deals with such false accusations at various stages and offers provisions for recourse to law regarding wrongful accusation.\n\nIndian Penal Code provides definite provisions to deal with false claims. When a false charge is made that damages a person's reputation, Section 499, Defamation, may be used. An accused person who intentionally disseminates false material with the goal of damaging another person's reputation may be subject to defamation litigation. The onus then shifts to the accuser to establish the veracity of the claim.\n\nIn addition, Section 182 punishes anybody who willfully harms a public servant by giving them misleading information while knowing it to be inaccurate. This provision can be particularly relevant in cases where false allegations are made during the investigative process, leading to wrongful harassment or legal consequences for the accused. Further, Chapter 191 prescribes punishment on those who invent false material to deceive authorities, which, inter alia, even includes the statement or other documents given as evidence based on a baseless report. In this extreme case of making a false report with an intention to cheat or deceive, it invokes charges under Section 420, IPC, for cheating and dishonestly.\n\nTo protect the rights of individuals from being injured by a false claim, the Indian judicial system protects the right to a fair trial to provide every accused with a chance to defend themselves before the court against any false allegation. This right incorporates the ideas of natural justice; no one may be sentenced based on misleading information. In criminal cases, the burden if upon the prosecution to provide evidence so as to prove that the accuser has committed the crime. A person who makes an accusation must prove the veracity of the claim.\n\nWhere the accusation is false, the prosecution will have to prove that the claim they made is true and believable. There are legal provisions safeguarding against abuse of the law, too. It includes the Anti-Defamation Act 2013, which aimed to ward off malicious prosecution and wrongful lawsuits. That is one of the sources of redress for those reputations harmed or damaged by a false statement made without cause or even with malice.\n\nApart from criminal law, a false accusation also allows the application of civil remedies. Damages that result from a claim, whether in the form of monetary losses or distress caused, may be sought for in cases of defamation. In case the false accusation is made publicly or has an impact on the reputation of a person, a civil remedy is also available to recover the damages.\n\nInternational Approaches towards False Accusation Cases\n\nThe issue of false accusation and the legal remedies available to those wrongfully accused is beyond the borders of India, and various legal systems worldwide offer safeguards and legal recourse to such individuals. In the United States, the legal framework for handling false accusations lies in defamation laws, criminal liability for false reporting, and remedies for wrongful prosecution. False statements intended to damage someone's reputation are protected under the U.S. Defamation Act.\n\nTo successfully launch a defamation action, a claimant must demonstrate that the comment was untrue, made with malicious intent, and caused injury to their reputation. Furthermore, in cases where false allegations are made with the intention of misleading law enforcement or the courts, criminal culpability may apply.\n\nFor instance, persons who file false police reports can be charged under a variety of statutes penalizing false statements to authorities, including laws against false reporting or obstruction of justice. Victims of false allegations may file lawsuits for malicious prosecution in order to obtain remedies in cases of unjust prosecution. Through this action, the person who was falsely accused can seek compensation for the injury that the judicial procedures against them caused.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, legal protections against false accusations are provided under Malicious Falsehood laws. These laws protect people's rights and ensure they can sue over anything stated with malice but that happens to cause detriment to their reputation, or business interest, or damage to property. The primary cause of malicious falsehood usually lies in intentional falsehood and misrepresentation for harm caused regarding someone's reputation and personal or professional status.\n\nIn criminal false statements, a person may be charged with perjury or perverting the course of justice if they have provided false information knowingly or willfully that resulted in wrongful convictions or the obstruction of justice. Malice is also an element of the action on the case for defamation and must be shown to exist, that the false statement was made with an improper motive or with knowledge of its falsity.\n\nIn Australia, in the same way as other common law countries, laws to deal with false allegations include defamation and false reporting. In the Australian context, a person who intends to harm somebody's reputation by making a false statement can be prosecuted civilly for defamation. Likewise, anyone who makes false information to the police or who provides false information to a public officer can be sued for crimes against false reports. The Defamation Act of Australia provides individuals with a legal opportunity to seek redress if they have been wrongly accused of crimes or misconduct, which has caused damage to their reputation. Even where false accusations lead to criminal charges or judicial proceedings, they may also seek compensation for emotional and financial harm occasioned by the wrongful legal actions.\n\nThe approach to false accusations in the international legal systems reflects an overall commitment to ensuring the protection of individuals from unjust claims that can cause immense damage to their reputations, livelihoods, and private lives. Although the actual legal provisions may differ from country to country, the bottom line is that the principle is a universal legal tenet-one that safeguards individuals from malicious or false accusations. Legal frameworks around the world ensure that those perpetuating false claims are given their just due, by civil action for defamation or criminal prosecution for false report or perjury, or reparations for wrongful prosecution.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Shubhash Atul case puts before the world a pressing need to look into the misuse of Sections 498A and 306 IPC. Even though these provisions are the bastions of protection of women's rights, the resultant misuse has been bringing harsh punishments for innocent people. It is a good gesture of the judiciary to come out with guidelines and safeguards but more consistent efforts are needed for a balanced dispensation of justice.\n\nWith a thrust in raising awareness, enhancing judicial training, and pushing for legislative reforms, society would work toward building a fair and just system of laws. Shubhash Atul case, among so many other, serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of misuse of laws and pressing the call for change.\n\nFAQs\n\n1.What does the Section 498A of the IPC lay out?\n\nThe IPC's Section 498A deals with cruelty committed by a husband or other family members against a woman.

It is believed this can even occur at the coldest temperatures possible.\n\nAccording to the theory, these spins can stay in constantly changing, interconnected states that behave oddly, similar to those in quantum mechanics. This state of matter also has properties that mimic how light and particles interact in the universe.\n\nHowever, proving the theory has, until now, proved very challenging. To this end, the international team developed advanced experiments (like neutron-scattering) and theoretical models to attempt to observe this state of matter for the first time.\n\nAnd, by all accounts, they appear to have been successful.\n\nA major breakthrough\n\n\u201cFractional matter quasiparticles, long theorized in quantum spin liquids, required significant advancements in experimental resolution to be convincingly tested in this type of material,\u201d said Romain Sibille, the experimental team leader at Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland."

According to Sci. News, Dulcibella camanchaca is the first large, active predatory amphipod creature found in the deep-sea zone.\n\nThe creature was discovered in Atacama Trench, or the Peru-Chile Trench. It is one of the most geographically isolated hadal features of the ocean. The rare living creature lacked \u201cpigmented eyes\u201d, displayed \u201capparent gigantism\u201d, and surprisingly used to feed other creatures, revealed a research published in Systematics and Biodiversity.\n\nAlso Read | A Nobel for Google DeepMind is a tribute to how AI can transform drug discovery\n\nRare creature named darkness Researches coined the genus name Dulcibella, which was inspired by Dulcinea del Toboso. Its second name, camanchaca, has been derived from a term which means \u2018darkness\u2019 in local South American languages.\n\nSee pics of the rare creature The new predatory amphipod was discovered around 7,902 metres below the sea in Atacama Trench.\n\nImage of the creature discovered in deep-ocean\n\nThe creature had a 'gigantic' structure compared to other creatures found in the hadal zone\n\nUnlike all the other creatures discovered in hadal zone, this one is a predator and feeds on other living creatures.\n\nThe new creature was discovered last year during an Integrated Deep-Ocean Observing System (IDOOS) Expedition aboard the R/V Abate Molina.\n\nThe discovery belongs to a new genus too The DNA and morphology data of the species point out that the newly-discovered creature belongs to a new genus. Which highlights the scope of further such discoveries in the Atacama Trench which can be assumed as an endemic hotspot.\n\nAlso Read | NASA unveils surprising discovery after opening cannister of asteroid Bennu\n\nScientists discovered four dulcibella camanchaca individuals at a depth of 7,902 m using a lander vehicle, which is an untethered platform used for carrying scientific equipment, including baited traps, to and from the ocean floor.\n\n\u201cThis study\u2019s collaborative effort and integrative approach confirmed Dulcibella camanchaca as a new species and highlight ongoing biodiversity discoveries in the Atacama Trench,\u201d Sci.news quoted Dr. Carolina Gonz\u00e1lez, a researcher at the Instituto Milenio de Oceanograf\u00eda."

Like many involved in dementia research, she has a personal connection to the disease. With a dentist father and social worker mother, Ducotterd initially planned to become a vet, but when she didn\u2019t get into veterinary school she studied biology at the University of Edinburgh instead. Around the same time, her grandmother\u2019s mental state began to decline.\n\n\u201cI was watching my granny start to buy food for people who didn\u2019t live with her anymore and forget big details about her life,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving that personal connection to the story made me so motivated by what I was doing in the lab. I thought: this is exactly what I want to do. Make medicines.\u201d She went on to a PhD at Newcastle. In the face of diminished neuroscience investment in the UK, she moved to Japan for a postdoctoral position studying Parkinson\u2019s disease. Later she worked at GSK in China and later at Eisai Pharmaceuticals in the USA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an amazingly global experience of drug discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to be innovative you have to think differently. And the more different ways of thinking you have in your group, the more you\u2019re going to challenge each other.\u201d\n\nShe ended up staying in America for nine years, before moving back to the UK at the end of 2022, by which time she had acquired a husband and a daughter. While she had been away, Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK had taken the lead in establishing new Drug Discovery Institutes at Oxford, Cambridge and in London, enabling them to function like biotech startups in a university setting, adding free-market pep to academic excellence.\n\nSince Ducotterd was an undergraduate, there has been revolutionary progress in neurodegenerative diseases, mostly driven by advances in computing.\n\n\u201cI went to university just after they\u2019d cloned Dolly the sheep,\u201d she says. \u201cThe molecular technologies have transformed the field \u2013 being able to sequence genomes in minutes rather than years; methods that let us do more rapid analysis of big data; artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u201d\n\nThe success of lecanemab, a drug that has been shown to slow Alzheimer\u2019s progression by 30 per cent in early-stage patients (but which has yet to be approved on the NHS) has also energised the field by showing that progress is possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never seen a trial that has shown we can slow the disease at all. It gives massive amounts of hope and investment because everyone now knows it is possible.\u201d\n\nOne of the projects she is particularly excited about involves leveraging human genetics to mimic natural resilience against dementia. \u201cThere is a really interesting study in a group in Holland where they\u2019re looking at people who live healthily into their hundreds cognitively,\u201d she says."

            "article_content": "Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) stock has likely impressed its shareholders with a nearly 60% gain over the last year. Such gains might even make investors forget that its current price is still 35% below the stock's peak in November 2021.\n\nNonetheless, a greater focus on its software business and the continuing growth of e-commerce have got the company back on track. Hence, the stock could continue to benefit investors amid its recovery.\n\nThe state of Shopify's stock\n\nThroughout its history, Shopify has stood out among e-commerce platforms. Its ability for no-code site development and the flexibility to customize websites drew entrepreneurs to Shopify, and the company's emphasis on website speeds reduced the possibility that website issues would hamper sales for its customers.\n\nMoreover, Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate of 19% for the e-commerce industry through 2030. This should mean more merchants turn to Shopify as more retail sales businesses move online.\n\nShopify has further emphasized its competitive advantage with ancillary services such as managing payments, monitoring inventory, or supporting email marketing campaigns. This part of the business, called merchant services, accounts for the majority of Shopify's revenue.\n\nHowever, an effort to expand merchant services into logistics brought about high expenses and ongoing losses, which contributed to a massive stock price decline in 2022. That led to Shopify reversing course and selling that business. After selling the logistics enterprise and suffering through some impairment charges, Shopify has again become profitable and stock price growth has returned.\n\nShopify's financials\n\nAdmittedly, Shopify has not grown as fast as it did before or during the pandemic when revenue growth either closely matched or, at times, exceeded the 50% level. Furthermore, Shopify increased the prices for its services in 2023, so its not clear how that affected customer churn.\n\nNonetheless, the company's revenue for the first nine months of 2024 of $6.1 billion increased 23% yearly. This closely matches the 25% growth forecast for this year and the 22% predicted in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, Shopify has reduced its operating expenses slightly in 2024. Investors might also remember that the $1.3 billion impairment from the sale of the logistics business in 2023 led to losses in that year despite a $1 billion gain from its equity investments. Amid those developments, its $726 million net income for the first three quarters of 2024 represents a vast improvement from the $525 million loss in the same year-ago period.\n\nStory Continues"

Let\u2019s duckin\u2019 go!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#CheckTheLink-age\n\nPRO TIP to get to the ranks quickly once you\u2019ve read the piece: Click the little comment box at the top right, and it drops all the way to the comments, just below a small scroll up to the rankings\n\nWEEK 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL PREVIEWS\n\nRams at 49ers, Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Rams and 49ers defenses are Top 6 in allowing TD/Drive (Rams 27.6%; 49ers 26.9%).\n\n\u25ba If the 49ers play Isaac Guerendo, you have to take the chance they believe he\u2019s okay and treat him as a high-end RB2 (with risk, admittedly). If Guerendo is out, Patrick Taylor is a high-upside/high-risk RB2/3 given the potential involvement of other backfield options.\n\n\u25ba If you take the four games after Brandon Aiyuk\u2019s injury, and when Brock Purdy wasn\u2019t hurt going in (Week 13), Jauan Jennings is WR4 in FPPG (19.1) with a league-high 34.1 TmTGT% \u2014 Deebo Samuel is WR64 (6.2) and WR40 (18.2%).\n\nChiefs at Browns, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Since his second game with the Chiefs, DeAndre Hopkins has never run more than 68.0% of the routes, has bounced around from 12.5-25.0 TmTGT% and has posted fantasy tallies of 34.6, 7.6, 4.4, 12.0, 11.0 and 11.2 points. Hopkins is more of a floor option, but his ceiling makes him the one Chiefs wideout to start.\n\n\u25ba In Isiah Pacheco\u2019s second game back, Kareem Hunt fell to 25.0 RBTouch%, dropping him out of Flex consideration, especially with Samaje Perine also mixed in. And Nick Chubb has topped 62.5% of the Browns rushes just twice, both in wins.\n\n\u25ba Jerry Jeudy and Elijah Moore haven\u2019t seen much of a usage difference without Cedric Tillman on the field outside of increased red zone and touchdown opportunities. Obviously, that\u2019s significant, but I wouldn\u2019t downgrade Jeudy if Tillman plays, and Moore would remain a boom/bust WR4.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBengals at Titans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Week 14 was Tee Higgins\u2019 first non-double-digit fantasy score since Week 4 and the lowest TmTGT% of the year (11.6).\n\n\u25ba Week 14 was also just the second time Nick Westbrook-Ikhine didn\u2019t score a touchdown or have at least two receptions since Week 4. The good news is that according to FTN Data, the Bengals allow the third-highest wide-open rate to outside receivers (10.3%) \u2014 you saw this first-hand on MNF \u2014 and the second-most FPPG (21.4). I\u2019m not calling him a must-start after last week, but if you need NWI\u2019s ceiling, it\u2019s still in play.\n\nCommanders at Saints, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Jeremy McNichols is a decent deep-league option. The Saints have allowed the most YPC (5.0) and a nice 7.8 YPR to running backs this year, and they have the third-best APA for opposing RBs.\n\n\u25ba With Derek Carr behind center, Marquez Valdes-Scantling was worth the ceiling as a WR4, but now, Alvin Kamara and Juwan Johnson (maybe) are the only Saints worth starting.\n\nRavens at Giants, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Ravens are still a favorable matchup for the passing game, but they have been better in their past three games, and Malik Nabers is an injury risk. There is a near-zero floor here.\n\n\u25ba The Ravens are a nightmare for opposing running backs, which means Tyrone Tracy Jr. is just an RB3 given the matchup and the Giants\u2019 woes (also lost another offensive lineman, Jon Runyan, this week).\n\n\u25ba Gambling on Rashod Bateman is a matchup decision \u2014 games with 9+ points: TB, CIN (x2), LAC, DAL, WSH \u2014 games with 6 or fewer points: KC, LV, DEN, PIT, CLE, BUF, PHI. Only LAC and LV are a bit unordinary, and the Giants haven\u2019t been beaten much in the passing game\u2026 though, teams haven\u2019t needed to pass much to beat them.\n\nCowboys at Panthers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Rico Dowdle has nearly 20 touches in each of his past three games and is RB12 in FPPG (13.4). In his five games with at least 16+ touches, Dowdle is averaging 16.3 FPPG, which would be RB8 on the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u25ba Adam Thielen\u2019s past two games: 28.4 TmTGT%, 17.3 FPPG, 100.5 YPG and 2.72 YPR. It\u2019s a small sample, but if you want the year-long pace applied to where he\u2019d rate: third, second, third and fifth, respectively.\n\nJets at Jaguars, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba If Breece Hall plays, consider him an RB2 given the risk, but his Top 10 upside would still be in play. Braelon Allen would be an RB3, and Isaiah Davis wouldn\u2019t be far behind. If Hall is out, Allen would be an RB2 and Davis an RB3. Despite his ability and upside, the Jets should be in control, allowing them to lean on Allen a tad more.\n\n\u25ba The Jaguars go 3-and-Out the most (41.8%), and the Jets defense has the fourth-highest forced 3&O% (36.6). It\u2019s not a great week to need either running back.\n\nDolphins at Texans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba This year\u2019s Dolphins offense doesn\u2019t operate the same as last year\u2019s \u2014 I discussed this on my podcast a few weeks ago \u2014 and Jaylen Waddle is better against man-heavy defenses than zone (due to how defenses are playing them and adjustments made to counteract). Unfortunately for Waddle, the Texans are the fifth-heaviest zone team (76.8%).\n\n\u25ba C.J. Stroud has actually been more accurate when blitzed this year, with similar Comp%, Time to Throw and Sack% marks, but the big differences are lower YD/Comp (13.3 to 11.5) and TD/Att% (6.9 to 4.8). Stroud was without Nico Collins for much of the year, but defenses taking away Tank Dell with/without Collins on the field has also hurt.\n\nColts at Broncos, Sunday, 4 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Broncos blitz the second most (25.5%), and Anthony Richardson hasn\u2019t been great throwing the ball in those situations, but he\u2019s evaded it quite a bit \u2014 low 4.3 Sack% (sixth-lowest) and fifth-most rushing yards (72).\n\n\u25ba The last time Courtland Sutton didn\u2019t have double-digit fantasy points in a game? Week 7, when he had zero targets against the Saints \u2014 he also had double-digit tallies in three of four games before that. While Sutton has topped 20 points just once, he\u2019s as stable of a WR2 as you can find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBills at Lions, Sunday, 4 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba If Keon Coleman returns, he\u2019s in play as a Hail Mary option. Coleman is WR13 in YPRR against man coverage (2.81), and the Lions are the man-heaviest team (41.3%).\n\n\u25ba Week 14 was James Cook\u2019s worst fantasy outing of the season, but the Bills were pass-happy \u2014 and then some \u2014 and Cook still had 100% of the RB rushes (Josh Allen and Curtis Samuel had the other rushing attempts). The risk with this matchup is the Bills deploy a similar strategy, making Cook a riskier RB2 than usual.\n\nSteelers at Eagles, Sunday, 4 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Eagles have the fourth-highest QBPressure% (38.7) with only four rushers, and the Steelers allow the fourth-highest QBPressure% with just four rushers (37.3). Further, Russell Wilson is completing just 30.0% of his passes when under pressure (22nd).\n\n\u25ba George Pickens sounds unlikely to play. If he\u2019s out there, he\u2019s worth the gamble in a WR3 way, similar to Malik Nabers last week. If out, Pat Freiermuth gets a modest bump, but you should avoid anyone else not named Jaylen Warren. Yes, I\u2019d find a way to sit Najee Harris if possible.\n\nPatriots at Cardinals, Sunday, 4 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Cardinals have given up decent numbers in the passing game to running backs, giving Rhamondre Stevenson a decent floor.\n\n\u25ba Marvin Harrison Jr. has been more involved against man coverage (31.4 TmTGT%), plus he has a higher TD/TGT% (9.4) compared to 19.1 and 5.8, respectively, against zone coverage. This is all very good news for the rookie. The Patriots run the third-most man at 40.9%.\n\nBuccaneers at Chargers, Sunday, 4 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba With the 11th-best YPRR against Cover-3 (2.98), Quentin Johnston could be worth the risk again this week \u2014 the Buccaneers use Cover-3 fifth-most at 43.4%.\n\n\u25ba If Bucky Irving plays, he\u2019s a must-start. If he\u2019s out, Rachaad White is a must-start, and Sean Tucker would be a Flex upside gamble (given the stingy Chargers defense, you\u2019d mostly be hoping for a touchdown).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u25ba If Ladd McConkey returns, you don\u2019t sit him. His return would push Joshua Palmer and Quentin Johnston into WR4/5 territory with the hope of a touchdown. If McConkey is out, you can boost both into the WR3/4 range with that same ceiling/risk but slightly higher floors.\n\nPackers at Seahawks, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba If Romeo Doubs returns, Jayden Reed would be the top Packers wideout, followed by Doubs and Christian Watson, though all three would be closely ranked\u2026\n\n\u25ba The Seahawks defense has turned a corner since midseason, and you can see it in the APA numbers. They are -2.9 for QBs and -3.0 for WRs compared to the league average.\n\n\u25ba If Kenneth Walker is out, Zach Charbonnet is in the RB1 conversation, and if Walker returns, I\u2019d consider Walker and Charbonnet as we do Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren. Walker may be safer, but Charbonnet has the upside, and he could even lead the way given his recent performance.\n\nBears at Vikings, Monday, 8 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Vikings blitz a league-high 26.9%. Caleb Williams is just 28th in TD+1D/ATT when blitzed (15.6%), with the second-highest Sack% (13.7).\n\n\u25ba As you saw previously, Williams handled the Vikings well \u2014 zero sacks when blitzed. DJ Moore and Keenan Allen had big games, and while I would go back to Moore and Allen this week, I wouldn\u2019t lock Williams into a repeat given the likely adjustments by DC Brian Flores and the Vikings defense.\n\nFalcons at Raiders, Monday, 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The interceptions were drive-killers, but Kirk Cousins looked better than he has in weeks, especially given it was a tough matchup. Now he gets the Raiders, and they run zone just 59.9% of the time \u2014 fourth lowest (also, Giants next week, and they\u2019re seventh lowest). It\u2019s not without risk, but Cousins has some streamability this week.\n\n\u25ba If Alexander Mattison returns, stay away from the backfield. If he remains sidelined, Sincere McCormick is a volume-reliant RB2/3.\n\nWEEK 15 SLEEPERS\n\nQUARTERBACK\n\nKirk Cousins, ATL \u2014 We\u2019ve seen the floor, but that\u2019s why Cousins is a sleeper (per above).\n\nRUNNING BACK\n\nRico Dowdle, DAL \u2014 Also, see above.\n\n\u2014 Also, see above. Justice Hill, BAL \u2014 Giants can\u2019t stop running backs, plus hope for garbage-time touchdown.\n\nWIDE RECEIVER\n\nKeenan Allen, CHI \u2014 If the Bears plan to rebound, Allen will be needed.\n\n\u2014 If the Bears plan to rebound, Allen will be needed. Adam Thielen, CAR \u2014 Not a sleeper \u2014 or, well, he shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 Thielen is a must-start.\n\n\u2014 Not a sleeper \u2014 or, well, he shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 Thielen is a must-start. Marvin Harrison Jr., ARI \u2014 Another one from the above notes, he\u2019s been inconsistent, but the matchup is promising.\n\nTIGHT END\n\nJake Ferguson, DAL \u2014 Good matchup. He saw six targets against the Bengals, even though he only caught half.\n\nFUN WITH RANKS\n\nWhat\u2019s this? No \u201creal\u201d list this week? Nope. I want to put the onus on all of you this week. Nicole and I had never watched Schitt\u2019s Creek, and we just burned through it in a month. With the offseason coming, I want some good\u2026 no, great!\u2026 shows to watch, and if it\u2019s a comedy, bonus points! I\u2019ll give you a list of shows we have on our \u201cto-watch\u201d list so you know what\u2019s already planned. Try to keep it to the past five years, maybe 10 \u2014 we have seen a lot before that.\n\nWatching when we can: Shrinking (S2), Penguin and Silo (S2)\n\nAlso on the list: Special Ops (S2), Day of the Jackal (maybe? Tell us if it\u2019s not worth it), Cross (same as Jackal), Skeleton Crew, Dexter: Original Sin, LOTR (S2), Squid Game (S2)\n\nWEEK 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL PROJECTIONS\n\n\ud83d\udea8 HEADS UP \ud83d\udea8 These can differ from my rankings, and MY RANKS are the order I\u2019d start players outside of added context, such as, \u201cNeed highest upside, even if risky.\u201d Also, based on 4-point TDs for QB, 6-point rest, and Half-PPR\n\nWEEK 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGS\n\n\ud83d\udea8 HEADS UP \ud83d\udea8\n\nThere is no perfect widget out there, sadly, still. I know many view this on your phone, but 1) use the rankings widget on a PC/laptop/etc. if possible or 2) open in your phone\u2019s browser, especially for Android users, to get the scrolling to work (or Android people can try a two-finger scroll).\n\nECR = \u201cExpert\u201d Consensus Ranking (which isn\u2019t updated by everyone consistently, so take with a grain of salt).\n\nUpdated regularly, so check up to lineups locking.\n\n(Top photo of Rico Dowdle: Tim Heitman-Imagn Images)"

            "article_content": "2024 was a year of mixed successes for the top smartphone industry players, but the devices we got were some of the best we\u2019ve ever seen. There were notable comebacks, a continued and welcome trend of maturation in the foldable space, a distinctly less welcome trend of promises of future AI features that didn\u2019t really live up to the hype, and a certain August launch that threw the Android Authority\u2018s usual content plans for a loop (thanks for that, Google!).\n\nThrough it all, we delivered more exclusive reports and deep dives than we\u2019ve ever shared in any calendar year, and we\u2019re not stopping any time soon. But now isn\u2019t the time to look forward, it\u2019s time to cast an eye back as we crown our Editor\u2019s Choice smartphone of the year 2024. Read on for our top five!\n\nBest foldable? Best camera phone? Best tablet? All this and more in our best tech of 2024 awards.\n\nCheck out the result of our Reader's Choice phone of the year award!\n\nHow we chose our winner\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nBefore we get to our top five, here\u2019s how we chose them. Our Editor\u2019s Choice award for smartphone of the year isn\u2019t a mantle we bestow lightly. The overall winner and the runners-up are all phones that go beyond success on a spec sheet.\n\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve reviewed over 40 phones. That process included extensive testing in performance, battery, and charging benchmarks, as well as subjective analysis of photography, hardware design, software smarts, update policies, and much much more. Our expert product testers spend countless hours digging into what makes these devices tick, and while everyone has their own favorites and preferences, when it comes to picking the year\u2019s best, we bring all of our senior editors and product testers together and reflect on our highest-reviewed phones as a collective of experts.\n\nIn 2024, we reviewed over 40 phones. Our expert product testers spend countless hours digging into what makes these devices tick.\n\nThe class of 2024 was made up of 20 phones from 12 brands from all over the globe. From there, each member of the jury assigned votes to their top five picks, ranked from fifth to first. Fifth place earned a single point, fourth took two points, and so on, up to a maximum of five points for the top pick. The phone that received the most points took home the grand prize.\n\nWith all the votes tallied, our winner took our most prestigious annual award in an absolute landslide\u2026\n\nAndroid Authority\u2018s Editor\u2019s Choice phone of the year 2024 Ryan Haines / Android Authority Four years at the top for a Pixel, but we\u2019ve never seen such a dominant win as this. With just shy of double the amount of votes as our runner-up, the Google Pixel 9 Pro takes the crown. With the Pro-tier Pixel winning in 2022 and 2023, this isn\u2019t a huge surprise \u2014 we\u2019re obviously big Pixel fans here. However, what really stands out this year is the fact the Pixel 9 Pro managed such a massive points gap despite the vote being split for the first time ever not between two Pixel flagships, but three. Yet, as much as we still loved the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL (mild spoiler for later in this list), the newly shrunken Pixel 9 Pro was the one that left the biggest impression. While it wasn\u2019t exactly a return to the Pixel 5-style small phone form factor, Google learned all the best lessons from the iPhone Pro range and delivered a reasonably-sized flagship (with a hint of iPhone inspiration to the overall design), while still managing to squeeze in all the best of the series \u2014 Gemini, Tensor, the photography chops, the most extensive software support guarantee in the business, and more. So, congrats to Google and the Pixel 9 Pro, our Editor\u2019s Choice smartphone of the year winner for 2024, and a phone that we told you was coming, but still managed to surprise us when it did. Google Pixel 9 Pro Google Pixel 9 Pro Impressive AI-powered features \u2022 Excellent build quality \u2022 Flexible, capable cameras \u2022 Reliable update commitment MSRP: $999.00 All Pro, in a compact package. The Google Pixel 9 Pro is the Pixel device many have been begging for for a long time: Google's very best smartphone hardware and software features, in a more compact form factor. With identical dimensions to the regular Pixel 9, it retains the same great specs as the much larger XL model, plus 16GB of RAM, up to 1TB of internal storage, and the Tensor G4 chipset. See price at Amazon See price at Google Store See price at Best Buy\n\nRunner-up If you can bet on one thing to deliver quality across the board every year, it\u2019s Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S Ultra series. Long gone are the days when we see anything particularly new from Android\u2019s de facto ultra-flagship, but you can\u2019t knock it for consistency. The Galaxy S24 Ultra may have dropped half a star from its perfect-scoring predecessor in our review as a result of a $100 price hike that didn\u2019t quite feel earned, and some persistent camera motion woes, but the sheer brilliance across the board was undeniable. Additions like the then-bleeding-edge Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset and the brand-new titanium frame joined the usual hallmarks of excellence we expect from Samsung\u2019s top dog. There was also the debut of Galaxy AI, which, while not quite as mature as Google\u2019s AI offerings, has grown over time to add real value to the Galaxy experience. It didn\u2019t come close to snatching the top spot, but it did comfortably secure the runner-up position. With Samsung\u2019s iron grip on the smartphone industry starting to slip a little, can the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra do one better in 2025? We\u2019ll have to wait and see. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Powerful, flexible cameras \u2022 Excellent update commitment \u2022 Brilliant flat display MSRP: $1,299.99 The best of the best in the S24 series Samsung's true flagship device, the Galaxy S24 Ultra offers the very best specs and features from any Galaxy phone to date. Ai and camera functions are the name of the game, with a 200MP primary camera, 50MP 5x telephoto, 10MP 3x telephoto, and 12MP ultrawide shooters. Smaller display bezels, 2,600 nit display, 5,000 mAh battery, an advanced cooling vapor chamber, up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage, and 12GB of RAM make for a powerful mobile computing system. The new ProVisual Engine offers AI-powered camera tools for photo and video capture.

Yes, we\u2019re Android Authority, but you can\u2019t talk with any actual authority about the devices and platform we dedicate ourselves to without testing out and intimately knowing what the competition is up to. And yep, it turns out that the iPhone 16 Pro is a pretty excellent phone. While some of its shine was dampened by the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence (and its fairly underwhelming current state), the iPhone 16 Pro nevertheless stood out, much like the Pixel 9 Pro, as another regular-sized flagship phone that refused to compromise. iOS 18 is better (and more Android-y!) than ever, the Action Button and overall design blueprint are being copied by Android brands for a reason, and the reduced real estate didn\u2019t lead to a loss of power under the hood. It didn\u2019t do enough to convince many of us on the team that a permanent switch would be worth it (myself included \u2014 no thank you), but the iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s bronze medal is a reminder of how capable Android\u2019s biggest rival continues to be. Apple iPhone 16 Pro Apple iPhone 16 Pro Excellent hardware \u2022 Flexible cameras \u2022 Solid software support MSRP: $999.00 The best of the iPhone 16 series, in a compact form factor. The iPhone 16 Pro offers a sleek 6.3-inch display with ultra-slim bezels for a refined, modern design. It features an upgraded 48MP ultrawide camera, 5x optical zoom on the telephoto lens, and a new touch-sensitive shutter button for a DSLR-like photography experience. Powered by a faster chip optimized for AI, the iPhone 16 Pro delivers top-tier performance in striking colors like gold titanium. See price at Amazon See price at Apple\n\nFourth place 2024 was a banner year for the Google Pixel line, with significant gains in market share and increasing awareness among smartphone users starting to prove that the Big G can finally become a big player in the hardware sector, too. The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL was the pinnacle of that promise \u2014 the Pixel series\u2019 best specs in the biggest possible package. As a lover of super-sized phones, this was my personal top pick, and while the Pixel 9 Pro romped home with the overall victory, the XL-ent larger model can be proud of its fourth place finish. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Google Pixel 9 Pro XL The best specs in the Pixel 9 series \u2022 Gorgeous display \u2022 Seven years of software updates MSRP: $1,099.00 Pure XL-ence. Google reserves its best hardware for the largest device in the line. The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL offers a 6.8-inch display, the biggest battery we've ever seen in a Pixel phone, and 37W wired charging. Otherwise, the Pixel 9 Pro and the Pixel 9 Pro XL share almost all other hardware and software features, giving users the option between display sizes with top hardware. See price at Amazon See price at Google Store - See price at Best Buy\n\nFifth place Welcome back, OnePlus! Okay, that\u2019s not exactly fair. The OnePlus Open deservedly took the runner-up spot in 2023, but there was no OnePlus foldable challenger in 2024 (side note: our top-ranked foldable was the Motorola Razr (2024), which came in joint sixth alongside the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE). But the OnePlus 12 becomes the first slab-style phone from the Android stalwart to crack the top five in our end-of-year Editor\u2019s Choice list since the OnePlus 7T way back in 2019. A Pro-grade phone without Pro in the name, the OnePlus 12 summoned some of that old-school flagship killer spirit, offering ridiculous power and rapid charging while undercutting many of its contemporaries on price. OnePlus 12 OnePlus 12 Bright, sharp display \u2022 Blistering-fast charging \u2022 Approachable price MSRP: $799.00 The flagship killer returns. The OnePlus 12 is an important update for the brand that never settles. The phone offers the latest and best technology, including a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, 50W wireless and 80W wired charging, next-gen Hasselblad cameras, and more.

We\u2019re also already gearing up to bring you the best possible coverage from CES 2025 in January, while also continuing to think of new and exciting ways to bring you the best analysis, opinions, and reporting at Android Authority throughout 2025 and beyond.\n\nUntil then, from our families to yours, we hope you all have a happy holidays!\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

            "article_content": "Altman called the change in the relationship \u201ctremendously sad.\u201d He continued:\n\nI grew up with Elon as like a mega hero. I thought what Elon was doing was absolutely incredible for the world, and I\u2019m still, of course, I mean, I have different feelings about him now, but I\u2019m still glad he exists. I mean that genuinely. Not just because I think his companies are awesome, which I do think, but because I think at a time when most of the world was not thinking very ambitiously, he pushed a lot of people, me included, to think much more ambitiously. And grateful is the wrong kind of word. But I\u2019m like thankful. You know, we started OpenAI together, and then at some point he totally lost faith in OpenAI and decided to go his own way. And that\u2019s fine, too. But I think of Elon as a builder and someone who \u2014 a known thing about Elon is that he really cares about being \u2018the guy.\u2019 But I think of him as someone who, if he\u2019s not, that just competes in the market and in the technology, and whatever else. And doesn\u2019t resort to lawfare. And, you know, whatever the stated complaint is, what I believe is he\u2019s a competitor and we\u2019re doing well. And that\u2019s sad to see.\n\nAltman said of Musk\u2019s close relationship with Trump:\n\nI may turn out to be wrong, but I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power to the degree that Elon has it to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses. And I don\u2019t think people would tolerate that. I don\u2019t think Elon would do it.\n\nOn OpenAI\u2019s relationship with Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI\u2019s largest investor, has put more than $13 billion into the company and has an exclusive license to its raw technologies. Altman once called the relationship \u201cthe best bromance in tech,\u201d but The Times and others have reported that the partnership has become strained as OpenAI seeks more and cheaper access to computing power and Microsoft has made moves to diversify its access to A.I. technology. OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion this year because of the steep costs of developing A.I.\n\nAt the DealBook Summit, Altman said of the relationship with Microsoft, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re disentangling. I will not pretend that there are no misalignments or challenges.\u201d He added:\n\nWe need lots of compute, more than we projected. And that has just been an unusual thing in the history of business, to scale that quickly. And there\u2019s been tension on that.\n\nSome of OpenAI\u2019s own products compete with those of partners that depend on its technologies. On whether that presents a conflict of interest, Altman said:\n\nWe have a big platform business. We have a big first party business. Many other companies manage both of those things. And we have things that we\u2019re really good at. Microsoft has things they\u2019re really good at. Again, there\u2019s not no tension, but on the whole, our incentives are pretty aligned.\n\nOn whether making progress in A.I. development was becoming more expensive and slower, as some experts have suggested, he doubled down on a message he\u2019d previously posted on social media: \u201cThere is no wall.\u201d Andrew asked the same question of Sundar Pichai, the Google C.E.O., which we\u2019ll recap in tomorrow\u2019s newsletter.\n\nOn A.G.I. and A.I. safety\n\nAltman has a business interest in suggesting that A.G.I. is near: When OpenAI decides that it has reached the milestone, Microsoft\u2019s exclusive license to use OpenAI\u2019s raw A.I. technologies ends. That would be a big bargaining chip in its negotiations with Microsoft. At the DealBook Summit, Altman suggested that A.G.I. was closer than most people expect, but he downplayed safety concerns, some of which he has raised himself or have come from his own former employees:\n\nA lot of the safety concerns that we and others expressed actually don\u2019t come at the A.G.I. moment. It\u2019s like, A.G.I. can get built, the world goes on mostly the same way. The economy moves faster, things grow faster.\n\nAltman said that he did expect there would be quick disruption of jobs in the relatively near term, but that the major upheaval would come with what he called \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d"

In response, Israel launched a large-scale offensive on Gaza, which the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed at least 44,930 people, the majority of them civilians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe United Nations has deemed the casualty figures provided by Gaza\u2019s health ministry reliable, underscoring the devastating toll the conflict has taken on the densely populated territory.\n\nWith inputs from agencies"

            "source": "The Daily Telegraph",
            "article_content": "The current Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, became the first UK premier in six years to meet with President Xi in Rio de Janeiro in November, where he promised that the UK \u201cwould be a predictable and pragmatic partner\u201d to China. Xi said: \u201cWe will break new ground in the China-UK relationship.\u201d\n\nAs Sir Keir presses ahead with what is widely being regarded as a reset of ties, Smith Finley\u2019s story highlights the risks involved.\n\nFor a new Government desperate to spur a stalling economy, partnering with China \u2013 a country that by some measures has more purchasing power than anywhere else in the world \u2013 may seem like an obvious solution.\n\nBut there is no such thing as a free lunch. Analysts and former diplomats warn that increasing trade and investment with China will threaten Britain\u2019s homegrown industries, create dependencies on a hostile state and bring major risks to our national security.\n\nClaims last week that an alleged Chinese spy had also become a \u201cclose confidant\u201d of the Duke of York before being banned from the UK only add to worries about the Government\u2019s efforts to court Beijing.\n\nAs Republican president-elect Donald Trump enters the White House in January, after campaigning hard on a promise to introduce tariffs of up to 60pc on goods from China, Starmer\u2019s reset could also destabilise Britain\u2019s relationship with its closest ally and leave the country at sea in a global trade war.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned and very disappointed and very worried,\u201d says Smith Finley. \u201cKeir Starmer advocating for this strong pragmatic relationship with China rings persistent alarm bells.\u201d\n\n\u2018Desperation for growth\u2019\n\nUK officials have taken pains to portray Britain\u2019s conversations with China as \u201cre-engagement\u201d, rather than a \u201creset\u201d. However, that message has not filtered through to China.\n\nRichard Burn, a former British trade commissioner to China and Hong Kong and now a senior adviser to global advisory firm APCO, has just returned from visiting five cities on a trip organised by the China-Britain Business Council.\n\nIn Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Beijing, the delegation met with party secretaries, mayors and vice governors.\n\n\u201cThey all noted that under the new Government there had been a reset, or that there could be a more positive approach to UK-China relations,\u201d says Burn.\n\nSir Keir\u2019s meeting with Xi follows a trip to China by David Lammy, the Foreign Secretary, in October, and comments from Jonathan Reynolds, the Business and Trade Secretary, that Britain \u201cneeds more engagement with China\u201d.\n\nRachel Reeves, the Chancellor, is expected to travel to China in January to resume the UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue after a six-year pause.\n\nIn April, before Labour came to power, then-shadow foreign secretary Lammy wrote an essay in which he said there was a need to \u201crecognise China\u2019s importance to the British economy\u201d.\n\nTrade in goods and services between China and Britain totalled \u00a387.7bn in the 12 months to June 2024, around 5pc of all UK trade, official figures show. China is already Britain\u2019s fifth-largest trading partner but there is potential for expansion."

            "article_content": "Ashok Ogra\n\nBashar al-Assad of Syria has been ousted. In less than a week, anti-regime coalition forces drove the tyrannical dictator into exile. A similar fate befell \u2018democratically-elected\u2019 Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh who was accused of rigging the elections and who in recent years functioned like more or less like a dictator. These swift and dramatic downfalls raise critical questions about the fragility of autocratic power and the forces that can bring down even the most entrenched despots.\n\nThe Illusion of Invincibility: Dictators often rule with an iron fist, projecting an image of strength and permanence. Yet history repeatedly demonstrates that their downfall can be sudden and dramatic. The relentless pursuit of justice, dignity, and freedom by ordinary people ensures that no autocrat is truly invincible. Even those who rule with the ferocity of \u201clions\u201d can end up as exiled \u201csheep,\u201d undone by the very people they sought to dominate.\n\nThroughout history, dictatorships have shown a tendency to collapse abruptly, driven by a combination of widespread public discontent, suppression of dissent, economic crises, and political missteps. While such regimes may project strength and stability, they remain inherently fragile. Their survival hinges on fear, patronage, and the suppression of dissent rather than genuine public support. Maintaining the illusion of invincibility often relies on controlling the narrative and securing the loyalty of key institutions, particularly the military and security forces. However, when this delicate balance falters, collapse can come with astonishing speed.\n\nThe latest examples from Syria and Bangladesh underscore this dynamic. Once the military or security apparatus withdraws support, the regime crumbles, exposing the hollowness of autocratic power. This pattern echoes throughout history. Robert Mugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe with an iron fist, famously declared that he would only leave the country \u201cin a coffin.\u201d Yet Mugabe, too, was deposed, proving that no autocrat is immune to the forces of change.\n\nUltimately, the illusion of invincibility is just that-an illusion. Dictators may wield power ruthlessly, but their rule is far more precarious than they or their supporters often believe. The determination of ordinary people to fight for freedom and dignity remains a potent force capable of toppling even the most fearsome regimes.\n\nModern Examples of Regime Collapse: Since the Second World War, 23% of the world\u2019s rulers have faced exile, imprisonment, or death after leaving office. For dictators, this figure rises to 69%. The vulnerability of autocrats is not a new phenomenon. Throughout history, regimes built on repression and fear have been toppled, sometimes by widespread uprisings and at other times by betrayal from within. Let me illustrate this with few recent examples:\n\nBashar al-Assad (Syria): After 24 years of brutal rule, Assad\u2019s regime collapsed under the weight of civil war, economic devastation, and international isolation. Despite his fierce suppression of dissent, the capture of key cities by opposition forces and the erosion of military loyalty forced him into exile in Russia.\n\nSheikh Hasina (Bangladesh): In August 2024, student-led protests against a discriminatory quota system morphed into a nationwide uprising. Economic woes and deep-rooted dissatisfaction with her leadership led to the military\u2019s withdrawal of support, precipitating her fall. She was granted refuge by the government of India.\n\nZine El Abidine Ben Ali (Tunisia): The 2011 Arab Spring began with protests over unemployment, corruption, and police brutality. The military\u2019s refusal to back Ben Ali forced him to flee to Saudi Arabia, making his regime the first casualty of the Arab Spring.\n\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi (Iran): The Shah\u2019s regime fell during the 1979 Iranian Revolution, driven by corruption, human rights abuses, and the alienation of religious factions. Mass protests ultimately forced him into exile.\n\nIdi Amin (Uganda): Known for his brutal regime, Amin fled to Saudi Arabia in 1979 after Tanzanian forces and rebels advanced on Kampala. His downfall was a result of terror, ethnic purges, and economic collapse including confiscating the businesses owned by Gujaratis who had migrated to Uganda over 150 years ago. Idi Amin was fond of saying :\u201dIn any country, there must be people who have to die. They are the sacrifices any nation has to make to achieve law and order.\u201d\n\nFerdinand Marcos (Philippines): Decades of martial law and corruption ended with the 1986 People Power Revolution. Military defections and mass protests forced Marcos into exile in Hawaii. The dictator would often tell his people: \u201cThere are many things we do not want to do, but we have to do them to survive.\u201d\n\nJean-Claude \u201cBaby Doc\u201d Duvalier (Haiti): Economic decline and growing unrest led to his flight to France in 1986. His regime\u2019s collapse was fueled by corruption and brutality.\n\nMengistu Haile Mariam (Ethiopia): Mengistu\u2019s Marxist regime fell in 1991 due to the Red Terror purges and economic hardship. As rebel forces closed in, he fled to Zimbabwe.\n\nPol Pot (Cambodia): Pol Pot case is slightly different though he too ruled like a dictator. He was the leader of the Khmer Rouge, a communist regime that ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. During his rule, he orchestrated a brutal campaign to transform Cambodia into an agrarian society, leading to the deaths of an estimated 1.7 to 2 million people through forced labour, starvation, and executions.\n\nHis ultimate fate: after being overthrown in 1979, Pol Pot lived in hiding and under house arrest. He died in the Cambodian jungle, without facing international justice for his crimes.\n\nThe Dictator\u2019s Dilemma: Noted economist Kaushik Basu, in his 2023 paper, explores the \u201cdictator\u2019s dilemma\u201d-the paradox where autocrats fear stepping down because of potential prosecution or retribution. To maintain power, they escalate repression, creating a cycle that makes their eventual downfall more violent and inevitable. This fear of accountability compels dictators to cling to power at all costs, ultimately making exile or violent overthrow their only escape routes.\n\nThe Effectiveness of Nonviolent Movements:\n\nNonviolent resistance has proven remarkably effective in toppling dictators. Research indicates that peaceful protests are twice as likely to succeed as violent uprisings. When large segments of the population mobilize peacefully, even the most repressive regimes struggle to maintain control. The recent cases of Sheikh Hasina and Ben Ali illustrate how sustained, nonviolent pressure can force autocrats into exile.\n\nThe Role of Elites and the Military: Apart from relying on army support, a dictator\u2019s survival also depends on the loyalty of elites and the military. Patronage networks, which reward key insiders with wealth and privileges, help maintain this loyalty. However, economic crises, corruption scandals, and internal power struggles can erode these networks- thus endangering the autocratic regimes. The refusal of security forces to suppress protests, as seen in Tunisia and Bangladesh, often marks the tipping point.\n\nSeeking Asylum: Motivations and Challenges: When dictators flee, they often seek asylum to avoid prosecution, ensure personal safety, and protect hidden wealth. Historical ties or mutual interests may lead allies to offer refuge.\n\nHowever, international pressure or criminal charges can complicate asylum. Slobodan Milosevi of Romania faced extradition and prosecution. Alberto Fujimori, who sought refuge in Japan, was later arrested and extradited to Peru.\n\nPost revolution challenges: The collapse of autocratic regimes underscores the fragility of despotic power and the enduring resilience of those who fight for justice and freedom. Whether through peaceful protests, economic crises, elite defections or refusal of the security forces to intervene, oppressive regimes are never permanent.\n\nHowever, the major challenge remains: how do such countries transition to stable democratic frameworks. The post-revolutionary states can either stabilize or descend into turmoil based on leadership, institutional strength, and societal cohesion. Successful revolutions need robust state structures and a capable leadership to avoid fragmentation and chaos. Therefore, ensuring peace, progress, and accountability after the fall of a dictator is crucial.\n\nAs Fareed Zakaria articulates in his seminal book \u201cThe Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad\u201d:in many post-revolutionary settings, merely holding elections is insufficient; building a culture of liberal democracy, including respect for rights and rule of law, is essential.\n\nWithout active citizen participation, transparent governance, and a thriving civil society, post-revolutionary democracies risk collapse or stagnation.\n\nThe cycle of authoritarianism can repeat, undermining the hard-won victories of those who risked everything for freedom. Remember, revolutions often fail without institutional frameworks to manage change.\n\n(The author works for reputed Apeejay Education, New Delhi)"

Hungry and skinny bears take more risks than fat bears.\"\n\nEssentially, eating berries and smaller prey isn't enough to tide a polar bear over.\n\n\"This study really brings home the message that there\u2019s no salvation from terrestrial feeding to help polar bears through the ice-free period,\" Derocher added.\n\nThe polar bear population in this area is estimated to have fallen 30 percent since 1987, and this study appears to prove that global warming will continue to make it even harder for the species to survive."

But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don't know what alien life might look like ?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists , who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI'm an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I've learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there's advanced alien life out there, I'm on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets , or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2014 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it's a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don't agree on a definition , and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nEvolution vs Natural Selection - YouTube Watch On\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life .\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet's atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures , which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA's definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions . Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal . They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2014 biological or not \u2014 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information . As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection .\n\nMinerals are an example of a nonliving system that has increased in diversity and complexity over billions of years. CC BY) (Image credit: Doug Bowman\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism's genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory , natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife .\n\nHowever, it's wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth . A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon , which forms the backbone of all life's essential molecules \u2014 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they're unrecognizable . As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they'll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution . As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth's crust. But other minerals, such as apatite , a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization , such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures .\n\nIt's unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road , not a straightforward path. And that's for life as we know it \u2014 for life as we don't know it, all bets are off."
