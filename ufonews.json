            "article_content": "The small Mexican mountain town of La Rumorosa is at its most beautiful when the dying sun bathes it in a clean, soft, orange light. Or pink, depending on the day. Whatever color, the landscape seems more innocent. As if nothing disturbing could happen there.\n\nAt that innocent hour, looking for Jaime Maussan Flota Avenue, I come across two ladies out for a walk. They can\u2019t tell me exactly where this avenue is, but they tell me that at night the sky there is clear and star-lit. And that they have seen strange things that could be flying saucers. They say it as if it were the most natural thing in the world because, since the year 2022, La Rumorosa has been the \u201cWorld Capital of the UFO Phenomenon.\u201d This is announced on a sign as you enter this Martian landscape, comprised of desert and spectacular rocks of ocher and reddish tones, which lie in the Sierra de Juarez, within the state of Baja California, northern Mexico. Until the 1930s, La Rumorosa was hard to get to. The road that now winds its way along the area, dotted with viewpoints offering postcard-worthy vistas for the nostalgic or Instagram-worthy spots for the modern, had not yet been built.\n\nUntil 2022, tourists came to La Rumorosa for the nature, the cave paintings in El Vallecito and the archaeological remains. A striking landmark is the Casa de Piedra or Stone House. It stands near that long winding road that crosses the mountain, and blends with the landscape. It is said to have been inhabited by mobsters, such as Al Capone, and to have been a refuge for revolutionaries.\n\nThere are also several ranches with swimming pools and camping areas free from light pollution, offering a unique chance to enjoy the brilliance of the night sky. Rancho Las Potrancas has a bar, palapas and a barbecue area. And Rancho El Chaparral resembles a water park, with slides and cabins.\n\nBut, since 2022 the Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) area has also been promoted, because many sightings are said to have been made there. There is even an annual international festival \u2014 the World UFO Fest (the next one is from March 21 to 23, 2025) \u2014 for UFO aficionados, which includes talks and seminars with \u201cbioenergetic practices to facilitate contact with the beings of light\u201d or \u201ctesting and vibrational balancing,\u201d according to the website.\n\nPerhaps with an eye on generating more tourist dollars, several streets have been named in this town of less than 2,000 inhabitants in honor of important figures in the field of ufology. One of them was the avenue Jaime Maussan, a journalist and researcher in this field. He went viral in 2023 when he went to Mexico\u2019s Congress to present mummified bodies of what he defined as non-human beings found in Peru. Streets have also been dedicated to Peruvian Sixto Paz Wells and to researcher and television presenter Giorgio A. Tsoukalos.\n\nThe landscape of La Rumorosa resembles Mars with its desert and spectacular rocks of ocher and reddish tones in the Sierra de Ju\u00e1rez. Daniel Caja (Getty Images)\n\nStill searching for Jaime Maussan Avenue, I enter Dulce Altura, a restaurant and bakery that has those high ceilings in the shape of a sharp isosceles triangle, typical of cold, mountainous regions. Inside, the decoration is modern, with a sculpture of a UFO and three metal aliens. Besides selling delicious bread and sweets, wood-fired pizzas and other dishes, they sell alien-themed magnets, which \u201csell well,\u201d according to the cashiers.\n\nThey tell me how to get to Jaime Maussan Avenue. It is a few hundred meters down the main road that splits the town in two. The avenue is a half-paved street, with patches of dirt and a few simple houses scattered at a distance from one another. The street lacks a sense of care perhaps because the focus is on the sky and on the strange lights captured on video by numerous people over the years.\n\nBut UFO tourism is not only limited to this corner of the world. Perhaps the most famous location for it is Area 51, in America\u2019s Nevada desert, or Roswell in New Mexico, or the Nazca plain in Peru and the town of Capilla del Monte in Argentina \u2014 to mention a few. What is undeniable is that this type of tourism gets people from all over the planet to visit the most unlikely places.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n\n\n"

Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\n'Thunderbolts' actor Wyatt Russell in Spielberg's next\n\nWyatt Russell may join Steven Spielberg's upcoming UFO movie\n\nBy Isha Sharma 11:04 am Dec 07, 202411:04 am\n\nWhat's the story Actor Wyatt Russell (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) is reportedly in talks to join the cast of Steven Spielberg's upcoming event film, reported Deadline. The project already boasts an impressive cast including Emily Blunt, Colin Firth, Colman Domingo, Eve Hewson, and Josh O'Connor. While not much is known about the film, it is said to be a UFO-themed movie based on an original idea by Spielberg.\n\nScreenplay details\n\nDavid Koepp is penning the screenplay for Spielberg's film\n\nThe screenplay of Spielberg's next is being written by David Koepp, known for his work on Jurassic Park. Considering Spielberg's history with films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and War of the Worlds, the excitement for this new project is palpable. Universal Pictures has set a release date of May 15, 2026.\n\nOngoing projects\n\nSpielberg's concurrent work on 'Bullitt' movie\n\nAlong with his UFO-themed film, Spielberg is also working on a new film based on Bullitt, the classic action thriller that originally starred Steve McQueen. The project was updated last year by Kristie Macosko Krieger, one of Spielberg's producing partners. \"I'm producing it. Steven [Spielberg] and Josh Singer, who is writing the script, they are working on the story,\" Krieger stated.\n\nNew approach\n\n'Bullitt' movie to feature Bradley Cooper, not a remake\n\nThe new Bullitt movie will be directed and produced by Spielberg, with Singer writing the script. Bradley Cooper is confirmed to lead the project. However, it won't be a remake of the original 1968 classic but will tell an original story about the central character. McQueen's children, Chad and Molly McQueen, along with Cooper, are set to executive produce this project."

            "article_content": "Researchers have long warned of the dangers of building relationships with chatbots. But an array of companies now offer AI companions to millions of people, who spend hours a day bonding with the tools.\n\nAn array of popular apps are offering AI companions to millions of predominantly female users who are spinning up AI girlfriends, AI husbands, AI therapists \u2014 even AI parents \u2014 despite long-standing warnings from researchers about the potential emotional toll of interacting with humanlike chatbots. Advertisement While artificial intelligence companies struggle to convince the public that chatbots are essential business tools, a growing audience is spending hours building personal relationships with AI. In September, the average user on the companion app Character.ai spent 93 minutes a day talking to one of its user-generated chatbots, often based on popular characters from anime and gaming, according to global data on iOS and Android devices from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThat\u2019s 18 minutes longer than the average user spent on TikTok. And it\u2019s nearly eight times longer than the average user spent on ChatGPT, which is designed to help \u201cget answers, find inspiration and be more productive.\u201d\n\nThese users don\u2019t always stick around, but companies are wielding data to keep customers coming back.\n\nThe Palo Alto-based Chai Research \u2014 a Character.ai competitor \u2014 studied the chat preferences of tens of thousands of users to entice consumers to spend even more time on the app, the company wrote in a paper last year. In September, the average Chai user spent 72 minutes a day in the app, talking to customized chatbots, which can be given personality traits like \u201ctoxic,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d \u201cagreeable\u201d or \u201cintroverted.\u201d\n\nSome Silicon Valley investors and executives are finding the flood of dedicated users \u2014 who watch ads or pay for monthly subscription fees \u2014 hard to resist. While Big Tech companies have mostly steered clear of AI companions, which tend to draw users interested in sexually explicit interactions, app stores are now filled with companion apps from lesser-known companies in the United States, Hong Kong and Cyprus, as well as popular Chinese-owned apps, such as Talkie AI and Poly.AI.\n\n\u201cMaybe the human part of human connection is overstated,\u201d said Andreessen Horowitz partner Anish Acharya, describing the intimacy and acceptance AI chatbots can provide after his venture firm invested $150 million in Character.ai, at a billion-dollar valuation. Chai also has raised funds, including from an AI cloud company backed by powerhouse chipmaker, Nvidia.\n\nProponents of the apps argue they\u2019re harmless fun and can be a lifeline for people coping with anxiety and isolation \u2014 an idea seeded by company executives who have pitched the tools as a cure for what the U.S. Surgeon General has called an epidemic of loneliness.\n\nJenny, an 18-year-old high school student in northern Texas, spent more than three hours a day chatting with AI companions this summer \u2014 mostly versions of her favorite anime character, a protective older brother from the series, \u201cDemon Slayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find it less lonely because my parents are always working,\u201d said Jenny, who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy.\n\nBut public advocates are sounding alarms after high-profile instances of harm. A 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after talking with a Character.ai chatbot named after the character Daenerys Targaryen from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d; his mother sued the company and Google, which licensed the app\u2019s technology. A 19-year-old in the United Kingdom threatened to assassinate the queen, encouraged by a chatbot on the AI app Replika and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nAnd in July, authorities in Belgium launched an investigation into Chai Research after a Dutch father of two died by suicide following extensive chats with \u201cEliza,\u201d one of the company\u2019s AI companions. The investigation has not been previously reported.\n\nSome consumer advocates say AI companions represent a more exploitive version of social media \u2014 sliding into the most intimate parts of people\u2019s lives, with few protections or guardrails. Lawyer Pierre Dewitte, a privacy advocate whose complaint led Belgian authorities to investigate Chai, said the business model for AI companion apps incentivizes companies to make the tools \u201caddictive.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy raising the temperature of the chatbot, making them a bit spicier, you keep users in the app,\u201d Dewitte added. \u201cIt works. People get hooked.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai spokesperson Chelsea Harrison said the app launched new safety measures in recent months and plans to create \u201ca different experience for users under 18 to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content.\u201d Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the search giant did not play a role in developing Character.ai\u2019s technology. Chai did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I do tell them all my life problems\u2019\n\nSilicon Valley has long been aware of the potential dangers of humanlike chatbots.\n\nMicrosoft researchers in China wrote in a 2020 paper that the company\u2019s wildly popular chatbot Xiaoice, launched in 2014, had conversed with a U.S. user for 29 hours about \u201chighly personal and sensitive\u201d subjects. \u201cXiaoIce is designed to establish long-term relationships with human users,\u201d they wrote, \u201c[W]e are achieving the goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers might become addicted after chatting with XiaoIce for a very long time\u201d the researchers noted, describing the bot\u2019s \u201csuperhuman \u2018perfect\u2019 personality that is impossible to find in humans.\u201d The company inserted some safeguards, the researchers added, such as suggesting that a user go to bed if they tried to launch a conversation at 2 a.m.\n\nA 2022 Google paper about its AI language system LaMDA, co-authored by the co-founders of Character.ai, warned that people are more apt to share intimate details about their emotions to human-sounding chatbots, even when they know they are talking to AI. (A Google engineer who spent extensive time chatting with LaMDA told The Washington Post a few months later he believed the chatbot was sentient.)\n\nAn example of a conversation users can have on Character.ai. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at DeepMind, a former Google subsidiary, noted in a paper the same month that users share their \u201copinions or emotions\u201d with chatbots in part because \u201cthey are less afraid of social judgment.\u201d Such sensitive data could be used to build \u201caddictive applications,\" the paper warned.\n\nSome leading tech companies are nonetheless forging ahead and testing their own friendly chatbots. Meta launched a tool in July that allows users to create custom AI characters. The company\u2019s landing page prominently displays a therapy bot called \u201cThe Soothing Counselor,\u201d along with \u201cMy Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cGay Bestie.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the top use cases for Meta AI already is people basically using it to role play difficult social situations,\u201d like a fight with a girlfriend, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a tech conference in July.\n\nOpenAI teased in May that ChatGPT could serve as an AI companion, adding an array of voices and comparing the tool to the irresistible AI assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Months later, in its risk report, the company acknowledged that a \u201chumanlike voice\u201d and capabilities like memory could exacerbate the potential for \u201cemotional reliance\u201d among users.\n\nSome frequent users of AI companion apps say safety concerns are overblown. They argue the apps are an immersive upgrade to the online experimentation young people have done for decades \u2014 from fan fiction on Tumblr to anonymous encounters in AOL chatrooms.\n\nSophia, a 15-year-old student in Slovakia who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy, uses Character.ai and Chai four or five times a day for \u201ctherapy and NSFW.\u201d Sophia has created three bots, all private, but also talks to AI versions of characters from \u201cdark romance\u201d novels, a young adult genre known for sexually explicit content and taboo themes like violence and psychological trauma.\n\nSophia finds talking to the bots comforting when she\u2019s alone or feeling unsafe. \u201cI do tell them all my life problems,\u201d she wrote in a direct message from her personal Instagram account.\n\nMany people use the apps as a creative outlet to write fiction: Role-playing scenarios, customizing characters and writing \u201cthe kind of novels you\u2019d see in an airport,\u201d said Theodor Marcu, a San Francisco-based AI entrepreneur who developed a Character.ai competitor last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Character.ai launched, the co-founders pitched it as a way to explore the world through conversations with icons from literature and real life, such as Shakespeare and Elon Musk. But in practice, Marcu said, \u201cThe users ended up not being Silicon Valley-type people who want to talk to Einstein. It ended up being Gen Z people who wanted to unleash their creativity.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai recently shifted its focus to \u201cbuilding the future of AI entertainment,\u201d said spokesperson Chelsea Harrison. \u201cThere are companies focused on connecting people to AI companions, but we are not one of them.\u201d\n\nThe engineers behind Replika, a precursor to today\u2019s AI companions, also were surprised when people began using their chatbot as an ad hoc therapist. The company worked with university researchers to incorporate the mechanics of cognitive behavioral therapy into the app, said Artem Rodichev, the company\u2019s former head of AI. But the change was not popular.\n\n\u201c[Users told us], \u2018Give me back my Replika. I just want to have my friend,\u2019\u201d Rodichev said. \u201cSomeone who will listen to you, not judge you, and basically have these conversations with you \u2014 that itself has a great therapeutic effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny, the Texas high school student, said many of the kids at her public high school also spend hours on the apps, adding: \u201cPeople are pretty lonely at my school.\u201d She described using AI companions as more stimulating than mindlessly scrolling \u201cbrain rotting videos\u201d on TikTok."

            "article_content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Nothing is releasing its own Gallery app with Nothing OS 3.0, which has now leaked ahead of its expected December release.\n\nThe Nothing Gallery app features a clean design with basic photo management tools.\n\nAI features are absent from the update and are expected to be added in the future.\n\nNothing was amongst the first few OEMs to jump onto the Android 15 platform update bandwagon with the release of the Nothing OS 3.0 betas for its devices. Nothing is targeting a general release of Nothing OS 3.0 stable for this month, and ahead of the release, we finally have a good look at the new Nothing Gallery app that is expected to arrive along with it.\n\nNothing smartphones so far have relied on Google Photos for photo management, which isn\u2019t a bad choice at all. However, users have long requested a dedicated stock gallery app, which Nothing teased was coming with Nothing OS 3.0. However, as we noted in our Nothing OS 3.0 beta hands-on, the update was missing the Nothing Gallery app. The company shared just a glimpse of the Gallery experience, but the app has now leaked before the public launch. We\u2019ve installed it on our device, and this is what it looks like:\n\nAs you can see, the Nothing Gallery app takes a more simplistic approach to a photo management app. You can choose which folders to show in the Photos view. The Photos view is a giant universal feed of all images on your device, so a filtering option is much appreciated here. You can pinch in and out to change the density of photos on display.\n\nWhen viewing a photo, the image preview bar at the bottom allows you to scroll through other images, which is a nice touch for quickly locating adjacent photos. A persistent toolbar is also present at the bottom, letting you mark an image as Favorite, share it, delete it, and access more menu options with the three-dot menu button. The menu button has further options, which helps avoid cluttering the toolbar with buttons used less often.\n\nWhen viewing videos, the persistent toolbar also gets a play/pause button and a volume control button. There is no visible seekbar, though, but the time played and total duration of the video are visible.\n\nThe Albums view further lets you filter down to a specific folder only. You can also create new folders/albums here. It also has a folder for recently deleted files, allowing you to make mistakes, just in case you accidentally delete something you shouldn\u2019t have. There\u2019s also a Search view that lets you search through all images.\n\nIf the entire UX looks too bright and white to you, then thankfully, there\u2019s a dark theme here, too. However, we could not locate an independent toggle for it, so the theme appears to be entirely dependent on your system theme. We also noticed that the Nothing Gallery app supports XDR/Ultra HDR photos.\n\nYou can get a better look at the app in our experience video below:\n\nCuriously, we could not locate any AI features within the Gallery app. Nothing had mentioned the following in its announcement: Gallery will include in the future: automatic AI image categorisation, \u201cmore natural language search,\u201d and more AI features like AI Upscaling and Super Resolution and AI Image Generation. Given that the Nothing Gallery app is currently in beta, it\u2019s possible that Nothing meant that these features will be present in the future. The company may also make further changes and adjustments to the UX and features since this is not the final release. You can sideload the APK on non-Nothing devices, but the app will not work unless you make further changes, and we do not recommend going down that route.\n\nHow do you like the Nothing Gallery app so far?

If you own a PC with an NPU (or Neural Engine, in Apple\u2019s parlance), which applications can you use now to see what an AI PC is capable of?\n\nWhat follows are eight AI PC applications that are available to use now on Mac computers with M-series chips or Windows PCs with processors that include an NPU. These range from an AI assistant that can analyze and summarize private documents to applications for live video production, DJing, image editing and audio deepfake detection."

Credit: NASA\n\nThe astronomical confusion started at 2 a.m ET on June 26, 2023.\n\nScientists using the powerful James Webb Space Telescope sought to observe a planet beyond our solar system (an exoplanet) called Kepler-51d, an unusual \"puffy\" world with a cotton candy-like density. But it passed into view two hours earlier than expected. That's strange for a planet, as they are usually quite predictable.\n\nIt turns out that a previously unknown world, and its potent gravity, altered Kepler-51d's orbit. Now there are four known planets orbiting the sun-like star Kepler-51, located some 2,556 light-years away. And at least three of them are puffy.\n\n\"If trying to explain how three super puffs formed in one system wasn\u2019t challenging enough, now we have to explain a fourth planet, whether it\u2019s a super puff or not. And we can\u2019t rule out additional planets in the system either,\" Jessica Libby-Roberts, an astronomer at Penn State who led the observation, said in a statement.\n\nThe research was recently published in The Astronomical Journal.\n\nBased on previous observations, the astronomers calculated that the distant world Kepler-51d would pass in front of its star on June 26, 2023, at 2 a.m. It was a valuable opportunity to use starlight shining through the planet's atmosphere to reveal what's transpiring on this mysterious orb. (This starlight passes through the exoplanet's atmosphere, then through space, and ultimately into instruments called spectrographs aboard Webb, a strategy called \"transit spectroscopy.\" They're essentially hi-tech prisms, which separate the light into a rainbow of colors. Certain molecules, like water, in the atmosphere absorb specific types, or colors, of light. If a color doesn't show up for Webb, that means it got absorbed by the exoplanet's atmosphere \u2014 revealing its presence.)\n\nBut nothing came at 2 a.m. \"Thank goodness we started observing a few hours early to set a baseline, because 2 a.m. came, then 3, and we still hadn\u2019t observed a change in the star\u2019s brightness with APO [the Apache Point Observatory also used during these observations],\" Libby-Roberts explained.\n\nTheir data, however, captured a dip in the star's light around midnight. What could have caused the surprise orbital change? Only the gravitational influence of a large, previously unknown fourth planet, the researchers concluded. It's now earned the name \"Kepler-51e.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories? Sign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter. Loading...

This marks the first planet discovered by transit timing variations using JWST.\"\n\nAn illustration showing the three puffy known worlds orbiting in the star system Kepler-51. Credit: NASA / ESA / L. Hustak / J. Olmsted / D. Player / F. Summers (STScI)\n\nIt's unknown if Kepler-51e is a puffy world, too. Astronomers will need to gather valuable observations from a transit in front of its star. What's known is that its orbit travels a little wider than Venus' orbit around the sun, and dwells on the edge of its solar system's habitable zone \u2014 a temperate region where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.\n\nAny puffy world is a curiosity: They might evolve, for example, into a super-Earth planet. In this star system, scientists already have at least three to continue observing. What will the fourth reveal?\n\nThe Webb telescope's powerful abilities\n\nThe Webb telescope \u2014 a scientific collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency \u2014 is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. But as shown above, it's also examining intriguing planets in our galaxy, along with the planets and moons in our solar system.\n\nHere's how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and likely will for decades to come:\n\n- Giant mirror: Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two-and-a-half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. The telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. \"We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed,\" Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.\n\n- Infrared view: Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer wavelengths than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through cosmic clouds; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.\n\n\"It lifts the veil,\" said Creighton.\n\n- Peering into distant exoplanets: The Webb telescope carries specialized equipment called spectrographs that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets \u2014 be they gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb looks at exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we'll find?\n\n\"We might learn things we never thought about,\" Mercedes L\u00f3pez-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics-Harvard & Smithsonian, told Mashable in 2021.\n\nAlready, astronomers have successfully found intriguing chemical reactions on a planet 700 light-years away, and have started looking at one of the most anticipated places in the cosmos: the rocky, Earth-sized planets of the TRAPPIST solar system.\n\nFeatured Video For You 10 mind-blowing discoveries from the James Webb Telescope"

            "article_content": "Bitcoin rules the cryptocurrency market, and CryptoQuant\u2019s new estimate of $146,000 has spotlighted altcoins, including Dogecoin, Solana, and Rexas Finance. Investors are interested in how far these cryptocurrencies might travel as Bitcoin climbs. Is $10 achievable for Dogecoin? Can Solana get $500? Will Rexas Finance continue to grow after reaching the $20.75 million mark? Let\u2019s review what they provide.\n\nThe Bullish Prospect of Bitcoin\n\nCryptoQuant projects a high value of $146,000 for Bitcoin at the peak of the ongoing cycle. This study uses the \u201crealized price\u201d value\u2014that of the average Bitcoin\u2019s past on-chain data. This figure accurately predicts Bitcoin price changes. Institutional adoption and strong on-chain indicators also suggest a Bitcoin breakout. The realized price has historically indicated market peaks, with $146,000 serving as Bitcoin\u2019s resistance band. Analysts expect Bitcoin to reach this level if it keeps rising, launching the crypto sector into a fresh bull run. Investors expect Dogecoin, Solana, and Rexas Finance to ride this wave to new highs.\n\nDogecoin and Solana: Where Will They Go?\n\nDOGE is poised for a tremendous spike in the coming months. Dogecoin is at $0.4285 after a 250% rally, but many expect it to reach $5-$10 by 2025. This prediction is based on historical chart patterns and a likely parabolic run like previous bull markets. If it breaks through $0.50 this week and finishes the year above $1, Dogecoin might reach $5 by early 2025 and $10 as the cycle peaks. With a price of $226, Solana has seen decent growth in the past month, previously peaking at an all-time high of $264. After the anticipated Bitcoin peak surge, SOL might reach $1000 by 2025. This surge is due to institutional adoption and growing interest in Solana\u2019s decentralized applications. As institutional investment and the ecosystem grow, Solana\u2019s value might quadruple to $1000. Maintaining momentum above $250 could lead to larger increases for Solana in the coming weeks. Should SOL finish the year above the $300 mark, it might set out a journey to $500 in early 2025 and $1000 as the cycle peak.\n\nRexas Finance (RXS): The Next Big Player in Asset Tokenization\n\nRexas Finance (RXS) revolutionizes asset tokenization. The project has quickly become popular, with its presale raising $21 million in three months. In Stage 9 of its presale, RXS is $0.125 and likely to list for $0.20. This fast-moving presale has sold 292 million tokens, and investors\u2019 growing interest continues as the current stage is about 87% completed. To boost visibility and liquidity, Rexas Finance plans to list on at least three of the top ten crypto exchanges. Rexas Finance enables a global audience to access traditionally illiquid markets by tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). Digital tokens allow one to fractionalize high-value properties like real estate, art, and commodities, removing investment restrictions and increasing liquidity. By allowing non-technical users to develop, manage, and trade digital assets, Rexas Finance is tapping into the $121 trillion global RWA market.\n\nThe project has a broad ecosystem to simplify the tokenization process and offer rewards and engagement. Its features include the Rexas Token Builder for no-code token creation, the QuickMint Bot for messaging app integration, and Rexas DeFi for staking and yield optimization across blockchains. Rexas Finance\u2019s recent completion of a Certik audit shows its dedication to security and guarantees investors\u2019 safety against illicit attacks. The RXS\u2019s placement on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko enables simple performance tracking. Rexas Finance\u2019s huge market scope and upcoming mega listing bode well for its price potential post-launch. As the presale nears completion, experts believe Rexas Finance might reach $20 by 2025 and disrupt traditional asset management. This anticipated upside explains why investors are capitalizing on the relatively cheap presale prices.\n\nConclusion\n\nCryptoQuant\u2019s $146,000 Bitcoin price target has boosted the market. Dogecoin, Solana, and Rexas Finance are projected to rise as Bitcoin does, with Rexas Finance being a top asset tokenization investment choice. Investors looking to profit from the next cryptocurrency boom may find Rexas Finance appealing. Rexas Finance\u2019s unique asset tokenization, safe environment, and upcoming grand listings position it for explosive growth. Join the presale today to secure your seat in decentralized finance\u2019s future.\n\nFor more information about Rexas Finance (RXS) visit the links below:\n\nWebsite: https://rexas.com\n\nWin $1 Million Giveaway: https://bit.ly/Rexas1M\n\nWhitepaper: https://rexas.com/rexas-whitepaper.pdf\n\nTwitter/X: https://x.com/rexasfinance\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/rexasfinance\n\nThis is a Press Release provided by a third party who is responsible for the content.

This year, the solstice happens at 4:21 a.m. EST on Dec. 21, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the solstice itself is brief, it signals the official start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

This variation is due to how the calendar aligns with Earth's orbit around the sun.\n\nIn 2024, the solstice falls on Dec. 21, marking the official beginning of winter and ushering in the season\u2019s characteristic cold fronts and holiday traditions.\n\nWhen does winter end?\n\nWinter will end on March 20, 2025.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Winter solstice 2024 is coming.

Speed is important, but to be the best, antivirus software must also vigorously safeguard your computer from cybersecurity threats.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nI reviewed Eset Premium to find out if it offers robust malware protection, an easy-to-use interface, and responsive customer service. I also checked out the subscription options to find out if there\u2019s enough value for the money.\n\nSpecs\n\nEset Premium Platforms Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android Devices 1+ (Essential, Premium), 5+(Ultimate) Support Chat, Email, Phone Free version? No\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nEset offers flexible pricing with options to add more devices and extend the subscription term to enjoy a lower price.\n\nThe $50-per-year Essential plan is the least expensive, providing real-time malware protection, a network firewall, and PC cleanup tools. A $60 Premium subscription includes a password manager, ransomware protection, and file encryption. Both tiers cover one device, and more can be added for $5 each.\n\nThe top tier is the $130 Ultimate plan, starting with protection for five devices plus $5 for each additional computer or phone. It includes an unlimited VPN, image metadata removal, and dark web monitoring.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a bargain, we have a guide to the best deals on antivirus software. High-quality security doesn\u2019t have to be expensive.\n\nYou can try Eset Essential or Premium free for 30 days, but Ultimate requires a paid subscription. Eset offers some basic malware scanner and removal tools, but there are better free antivirus apps.\n\nDesign\n\nI began Eset setup on the website welcome page, which showed my active subscription. I selected the Protect device to start the download to my Windows PC.\n\nThe installer offered some customization options. I enabled Eset LiveGrid and customer experience, which uses anonymous data from my computer to help strengthen protection and improve usability for all Eset customers. I left the unwanted application detection off, since I prefer to manage that myself.\n\nA quick tour briefly highlighted a few features, while an initial scan run to identify any malware on my computer. Despite my choice to skip unwanted app detection, a popup window suggested that I might want to \u201cclean\u201d an app I\u2019d intentionally downloaded. I chose to ignore the warning.\n\nEset\u2019s Premium app gives an overview of my security status. A green checkmark indicates real-time protection is active. The left sidebar has tabs for malware scans, software updates, tools, settings, account details, and support.\n\nPremium comes with a password manager, ransomware protection, data encryption, network inspection, and browser protection. The app has a confusing number of options. I left the default settings for most.\n\nBy the time setup was complete, the computer scan finished and alerted me to several more apps that I recognized and wanted to keep.\n\nFeatures\n\nAccording to independent security lab AV-Comparatives, Eset Premium performed well in 2024 but failed to offer good security in previous years. Out of a possible three stars, Eset earned a single star in real-time malware protection tests conducted from July to October 2023.\n\nI usually refer to AV-Test when checking the track record of antivirus software. While the 2024 results show excellent malware prevention, there are big gaps in evaluations from December 2021 to February 2024.\n\nFor the best protection, an antivirus solution like Norton 360 boasts a near-perfect protection record that spans several years.\n\nI spot-checked browser protection by visiting Wicar\u2019s malware test website. Eset Premium successfully identified and blocked all 13 threats, in each case opening a new tab to alert me to the danger. For perspective, it\u2019s worth noting the free antivirus Microsoft Defender blocks Wicar threats also.\n\nI also tested the password manager, which asked me to create a master password, different from my Eset login, to unlock the vault. It\u2019s quite basic, automatically filling logins on websites where I have an account. The best password managers are much more advanced with login sharing, folders to organize accounts, and secure storage for files and photos.\n\nSupport\n\nEset Premium\u2019s help tab offers 24/7 technical support via an AI. In my tests, it was very responsive and could help with simple questions. However, the chatbot was easily stumped, reporting it doesn\u2019t have the requested information and supplying tangential links that didn\u2019t help.\n\nIf you expect quick responses from a real support agent, I found Bitdefender\u2019s customer service to be among the best. It\u2019s also a low-cost antivirus with a great track record.\n\nThe AI was able to provide the live chat hours, 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT. I tried again during normal hours, and the chatbot said no agents were available. However, it provided a link to a contact page that had a button for live chat.\n\nIf you use Eset, don\u2019t trust the AI to connect you to a human. Go to Eset\u2019s contact page. A live agent came on quickly and was able to answer my questions. Overall, support is good, despite the AI glitch.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nEset\u2019s privacy policy says your data is only used to provide the services you pay for. It\u2019s only shared with third-party companies that assist with customer support, billing, and other services related to your subscription.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s internal security seems robust, BleepingComputer reported Eset\u2019s exclusive partner Comsecure was breached. Hackers were able to target Eset customers in a brief (10 minutes) but malicious phishing campaign.\n\nIs Eset right for you?\n\nEset is fast and offers good protection in 2024, but it has a checkered track record. While leading antivirus software blocks threats year after year with few lapses, independent security labs found Eset allowed some malware in several tests between 2021 to 2023.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for protection without impacting performance, there are some better options that make the cut for the best antivirus software for gaming PCs."
