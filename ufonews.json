While it\u2019s certainly not the first time someone reported seeing strange flying objects in the sky over San Antonio, it\u2019s an unusually clear video of what folks believe to be a UFO.\n\nA TikTok user shared a video of a mysterious rotating object hovering in the sky off North Alamo Street in Downtown San Antonio. While it appeared metallic or white in the video, the TikTok poster, Justin Delgado, says it nearly blended in with the darkest part of the sky.\n\nWhen the video was shared on Reddit, several commenters noted they\u2019ve been seeing mysterious objects in the sky more frequently as of late. Some said reports or quickly cropping up in New Mexico, Arizona and across the globe while other say they\u2019ve seen suspicious activity in Texas.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cI seen it all the way from Lacoste,\u201d Reddit user Historical_Wish_7627 commented. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing lots of weird stuff in the sky lately.\u201d\n\nAnother Reddit poster who lives in a rural area outside San Antonio reported seeing what looked like a satellite moving across the sky one night that faded into the night sky. The same poster says they saw a pair of mysterious lights, which they say wasn\u2019t a helicopter or airplane, hovering over the Alamo City.\n\nOthers were quick to quips on the speculation of aliens visiting San Antonio. In reference to a recent video of a mattress flying down a highway in the city, having dislodged off the back of a fast-moving pickup truck, Reddit users joked the mattress had made it into airspace.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\n\u201cThe highway mattress has breached containment,\u201d Reddit user audientix posted, with many responding with their own jokes about the mattress being the sources of the conspiracy. There were plenty of other jokes to be made on the thread without reference to a mattress, though.\n\n\u201cThat was abuela\u2019s chancla after whooping you so hard it was sent into orbit,\u201d Reddit user Chiken_97 wrote."

While many users appreciate the feature\u2019s convenience, many others prefer to turn off AI overviews because AI results need to be double-checked for accuracy, often defeating the purpose of a Google Search. Google understands the need to make it easier to cross-check and verify AI overview results, and it could soon make it easier to do so by listing all the sources and related content that make up the AI overview summary in Gemini results.\n\nAuthority Insights story on Android Authority. Discover You're reading anstory on Android Authority. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won't find anywhere else. An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.\n\nWhen you search using Gemini in the Google app and receive an AI Overview response, you can check the AI result for its sources. However, doing so involves using the Google \u201cG\u201d icon at the bottom of every answer, which then uses Google Search to find similar content. This is what this process looks like at the moment:\n\nThe latest Google app v15.47.28 beta appears to be testing the addition of links to relevant web pages directly within the text result of AI Overviews in Gemini results. Google had mentioned this change for AI Overviews in August but did not mention it for the Google app. We managed to activate the feature in the Google app, and here\u2019s how it would appear.\n\nThe expand icon at the bottom right (next to the Source and Related Content section) shows a list of all the sources and related content from different websites, as seen in the third screenshot above.\n\nThis is similar in approach to how Google\u2019s AI overviews on the web appear on your mobile device, which is shown below for reference:\n\nAamir Siddiqui / Android Authority\n\nThis UI for additional sourcing is not currently live within the Google app for Android. We don\u2019t know if and when Google will go ahead with the change. However, given how the approach aligns with the mobile-web version of AI overviews, we hope to see it go live on Android very soon.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us!

Note that the Perimeter is an open-world, non-linear location, so you\u2019ll use your deductions to decide your next steps.\n\nBetween solving the mysteries surrounding the Perimeter and recent disappearances, you\u2019ll be facing off against horrifying creatures and bosses. It\u2019s not a horror game, so to speak, but \u2013 drenched in atmosphere and oozing creative creatures \u2013 it\u2019s a haunting and engrossing location to search and slice your way through.\n\nIt\u2019s also impossible to ignore Enigma of Fear\u2019s beautiful art design, seamlessly blending pixel art sprites with old-school-style 3D environments. These visuals go a long way in making the Perimeter and the mystery at its heart that much more engrossing.\n\nEnigma of Fear is currently available at a 10% discount, costing just $22.49 / \u00a318.89 on Steam until Thursday, December 5. Currently sitting at 93% \u2018very positive\u2019 reviews, Enigma of Fear is well on its way to reaching the prestigious \u2018overwhelmingly positive\u2019 tag, too.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking to pick up one of the best indie games this year, then you\u2019d be remiss not to grab Enigma of Fear during this introductory offer.

Credit: Getty Images\n\nFlorida International University did not violate a federal law meant to protect people with disabilities when it tossed a student from its medical school for academic underperformance, an Atlanta federal appeals court ruled Monday in a years-long legal battle.\n\nIn a 10-page ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit opined that Elie Nehme, who had failed numerous courses and was forced to repeat a year of medical school, didn\u2019t qualify for protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy? He could not meet the university\u2019s minimum academic standards, even with reasonable accommodations for his disability,\u201d the court wrote in the ruling.\n\nNehme \u201cdid not get off to a good start\u201d in medical school, the opinion notes. During his first year he failed an introductory biology course (though passed it during a remediation exam) and showed \u201cmarginal competency\u201d in three other first-year medical school courses. His second year of medical school was worse, when he failed a course (and the remedial exam) in cardiac and pulmonary medicine.\n\nOne of Nehme\u2019s professors directed him to the medical school\u2019s wellness center to see whether he qualified for accommodations. He did. Diagnoses for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and an unspecified anxiety disorder qualified Nehme for two accommodations: 50% extra time on exams and a minimally distracting testing room.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nPoor performance continues\n\nBut Nehme\u2019s poor performance continued. The medical school\u2019s student evaluation and promotion committee scheduled a hearing with Nehme for March. Before that, though, Nehme requested and received voluntary medical leave from January through April 2018.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile on leave, Nehme appeared before the medical school\u2019s student evaluation and promotion committee, testifying that he had medical problems that made it hard for him to attend class. Despite their concerns, the committee allowed Nehme to repeat his second year of medical school.\n\nHe passed his classes and was allowed to remain for a third year, which is when clinical experience begins.\n\nAlthough he performed well in his practical experiences and got good evaluations from the physicians in the field he worked with, his academic performance continued to be subpar; Nehme scored below the 10th percentile on seven exams in his third year.\n\nHe was again called before the school of medicine\u2019s promotion committee. At the hearing, Nehme blamed his failure of a year-end psychiatry exam on a fire in his neighbor\u2019s apartment on the morning of the test. He said he failed his year-end surgery exam because he was distracted by his father\u2019s medical problems.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHowever, he never claimed that he lacked proper disability accommodations for any of the exams. The medical school\u2019s evaluation and promotion committee recommended that Nehme be allowed to voluntarily withdraw or be dismissed.\n\nHe appealed the committee\u2019s decision to the medical school\u2019s appeal committee. There, he reiterated his struggles but never mentioned lack of accommodations. The dean affirmed the promotion committee\u2019s recommendation that he be dismissed. He appealed to FIU\u2019s interim provost.\n\nDuring that appeal, Nehme claimed he received improper accommodations for one of his exams but not all of them. The interim provost referred Nehme\u2019s new lack-of-accommodations claim to the school\u2019s Office of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Access.\n\nWhile that office found sufficient evidence to support Nehme\u2019s claim the finding was further reviewed by the university. The interim provost found \u201cno indication that the allegations regarding a lack of accommodations made by Mr. Nehme had an adverse impact on his academic performance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHe was dismissed from medical school Oct. 16, 2020.\n\nOne month later, Nehme filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, where he alleged failure by the school to provide reasonable accommodations for his disability and also illegal discrimination.\n\nFIU successfully moved for summary judgment on both claims, arguing (among other things) that Nehme could not show a violation of the ADA because he did not qualify for the protections under the federal law. Nehme appealed that decision.\n\nDecision affirmed\n\nIn affirming the decision, the appeals court noted that \u201cdecision makers the promotion committee, appeals committee, dean, and interim provost all agreed that Nehme did not have the academic skills necessary to succeed, and thus could not be promoted to the fourth year of medical school. They based their decision on Nehme\u2019s exceedingly poor academic record, which reflected his inability to meet the medical school\u2019s \u2018essential eligibility requirements,\u2019 even when he received full accommodations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe court continued: \u201cThe record thoroughly supports the university\u2019s conclusion. Setting aside the disputed Psychiatry retake, Nehme still failed a total of eight courses. And five of those failures came after he was already on academic probation \u2014 a designation marking \u2018unsatisfactory progress toward the medical degree,\u2019 and one that often serves as a \u2018precursor to dismissal from medical school.\u2019 The medical school\u2019s handbook is plain: a student on probation \u2018may be recommended for dismissal\u2019 if her \u2018academic performance does not improve.\u2019 That is exactly what happened here.\u201d\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE"

Close Read more\n\nA breakthrough brain circuit discovery may lead to new treatments for anxiety and stress disorders, and potentially a pill providing the benefits of yoga.\n\nResearchers from the Salk Institute in the US have discovered the pathway behind voluntary breathing and emotional regulation in mice brains.\n\nTheir study, published recently in the journal Nature Neuroscience, reveals connections between the brain\u2019s more complex regions and the breathing centre of the primitive brainstem which enables breathing coordination with emotional state.\n\nWhile breathing is mainly automatic, human beings and some animals can self-soothe by slowing breathing, an approach that\u2019s a central part of practices like mindfulness and yoga.\n\nHow exactly the brain regulates breathing and how this impacts anxiety and one\u2019s emotional state is little understood. Scientists say only subconscious breathing mechanisms in the brainstem have been thoroughly understood so far.\n\nNeurons in mouse brain behind breathing regulation ( Salk Institute )\n\nIn the new study, researchers set out to find conscious top-down mechanisms connecting emotional regulation and breathing.\n\nThey first assessed a brain connectivity database to probe connections between different brain areas. The analysis revealed a potential breathing circuit connecting a frontal region, called the anterior cingulate cortex, to an intermediate brainstem area, which then connected to the medulla just below.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the medulla, when active, initiates breathing but signals coming down from a brainstem region are known to inhibit this activity and slow down breathing.\n\nResearchers hypothesised that certain emotions or behaviours could lead to the activation of the brainstem region, which in turn could lower activity in the medulla and slower breath.\n\nHow Breathing Exercises Can Reduce Anxiety\n\nTo test the theory, they recorded brain activity in mice when their breathing was altered during activities like sniffing, swimming, and drinking as well as during conditions inducing fear and anxiety.\n\nResearchers found that when the connection between the cortex and the brainstem region was activated, mice were calmer and breathed more slowly.\n\nThis communication decreased when they were in anxiety-inducing situations, and breathing rates went up.\n\nBy following this pathway, researchers discovered a group of neurons in the frontal cortex of the mice brain that connects to the brainstem and governs essential functions like breathing.\n\n8 Foods That Help With Anxiety According To Experts\n\nThis connection, researchers say, enables mice to coordinate their breathing with their current behaviour and emotional state.\n\nFurther analysis of the connection revealed a new set of brain cells and molecules which scientists believe can be targeted with drugs.\n\nResearchers say the findings may lead to long-term solutions for people with anxiety, stress, and panic disorders.\n\n\u201cOur findings got me thinking: could we develop drugs to activate these neurons and manually slow our breathing or prevent hyperventilation in panic disorder?\u201d study co-author Jinho Jhang said.\n\n\u201cI want to use these findings to design a yoga pill. It may sound silly, and the translation of our work into a marketable drug will take years, but we now have a potentially targetable brain circuit for creating therapeutics that could instantly slow breathing and initiate a peaceful, meditative state,\u201d Sung Han, another author of the study, said."

            "article_content": "It is the world\u2019s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how extraordinary it is,\u201d said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. \u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nVan Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature -- which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July \u2014 is the first ever to take place.\n\nNone has ever been seen alive at sea.\n\nThe list of what scientists don\u2019t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don\u2019t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they\u2019ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don\u2019t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don\u2019t know how this one died.\n\nResearchers studying the 16-foot-long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin are hoping to find that out this week.\n\n\u201cThere may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,\u201d said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. \u201cWho knows what we\u2019ll discover?\u201d\n\nOnly six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification.\n\nNew Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.\n\nGet a weekly recap of the latest San Francisco Bay Area housing news. Sign up for NBC Bay Area\u2019s Housing Deconstructed newsletter.\n\nDNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species \u2014 and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn\u2019t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before.\n\nOn Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks \u2014 normal, they said, and not the cause.\n\nThe dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with M\u0101ori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.\n\nMembers of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -\u2013 a prayer -\u2013 over the creature before the study begins.\n\n\u201cAccording to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,\u201d said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.\u201d\n\nThe iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale\u2019s head this week.\n\n\u201cIt all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,\u201d Cassidy said.\n\nIt\u2019s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean's deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery.\n\nThe assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery.\n\n\u201cWhat we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,\u201d said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \u201cIn discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.\u201d"

Pricing and availability subject to change.\n\n\n\n\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\n\n\nStill sleeping on that decades-old mattress? You already know it's time for an upgrade. Cyber Monday is your ticket to shopping some of the best mattress deals of the year. Starting today, you can score some of our favorite mattresses at some of their biggest discounts yet. A more comfortable bed means better, more restful sleep after all.\n\nAs a Good Housekeeping shopping editor, I regularly vet deals to make sure you're getting the best prices without falling victim to some of the seedy fake deals that often pop up. And to give you the best product recommendations possible (and not just a good deal), I consulted our experts in the Good Housekeeping Institute Textiles Lab for buying advice. The crew continually tests, evaluates and compare mattresses from popular brands like Saatva, Helix and more to determine which really is the best of the best.\n\nSaatva Cyber Monday Sale\n\n\n\n\n\nClassic\n\n$1676.00 at saatva.com\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe deal: For Cyber Monday, Good Housekeeping readers can take 20% off any of their Saatva orders (with a minimum $1,000 spend) by shopping through our exclusive link.\n\n\n\nWhy we love it: \u201cSaatva's Classic Mattress is our pick for the best overall mattress for its exceptional support and durability,\" says Textiles, Paper & Apparel Lab Product Analyst Grace Wu. The brand even provides complimentary white-glove delivery and mattress removal, plus a generous 365-night trial (with a $99 pickup fee if you opt to return it) on all their mattresses, including memory foam, latex and hybrid offerings.\n\nOur tests showed: Out of the hundreds and hundreds of mattresses our Lab pros have tested over the years, the Saatva Classic Mattress remains a consistent winner in tests and evaluations. Ranked as our best overall mattress, this innerspring pick excels at support, breathability and durability.\n\n\n\nREAD OUR FULL REVIEW: Saatva Classic Mattress\n\nBear Cyber Monday Mattress Deals\n\n\n\n\n\nElite Hybrid\n\nBear\n\n$1499.00 at bearmattress.com\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe deal: Today is the last day \u2013 through December 2, Good Housekeeping readers can receive a 40% exclusive discount at Bear with code GH40.

Bear offers a 120-day free trial period and free shipping within the continental U.S., but you'll have to pay $100 to $175 for a setup or removal service.\n\nWhy we love it: Hybrid mattresses are a popular pick, as they bridge the comfort of foam with the support of coils. Wu says if she had to recommend just one hybrid, it would be this one. \"It's done incredibly well in our tests and won over a variety of different users,\" she shares. It's best for side and back sleepers.\n\nOur tests showed: The pressure-relieving zones throughout this top-tested mattress are designed to promote proper spine alignment and provide cushioning for the hips and back to alleviate pain.

And our Lab pros agree. \"While mattress companies offer discounts and sales throughout the year, a holiday weekend is when you'll see the most consistent and competitive offers across brands,\" explains Wu. Beyond Cyber Week, mattress brands historically choose holiday weekends like Labor Day, Memorial Day and Presidents' Day.\n\nExpert tips for finding Cyber Week mattress deals\n\nSometimes, it's worth it to splurge. Remember: Sleep is important. Quality sleep at night can influence the course of your entire day \u2014 physically and mentally. So, it may be worth splurging a bit on a mattress that sounds right for you, but shopping during Cyber Monday will help bring that price down and keep some cash in your wallet.\n\nDon't just buy something because it's a good deal. \"My advice to shoppers is do some research in general to find a few different options (generally three to five styles) you genuinely like the sound of and check back in for sales,\" says Wu.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

            "source": "TechRepublic",
            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Mac security provider Moonlock, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u2019\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The fate of Google\u2019s Pixel Tablet seems uncertain at this point, with multiple leaks suggesting that a successor was put on ice. It seems, however, that a Pixel Tablet 2 moved into advanced stages of development with some neat upgrades before it was unceremoniously axed.\n\nThe folks over at Android Authority, citing internal documents, report that the second-generation Pixel Tablet would\u2019ve arrived armed with the Tensor G4 silicon, which also powers the Google Pixel 9 series smartphones. Google was also reportedly eyeing a cellular version with a Samsung Exynos 5G modem for the slate.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe biggest upgrade, however, would have been the display. The Pixel Tablet was apparently lined up for a 120Hz refresh rate screen, alongside a slight bump in the peak brightness figures.\n\nThe current-gen Pixel Tablet offers a 60Hz LCD screen, which is arguably subpar for the asking price of $499 at the very minimum. \u201cScrolling through menus, apps, etc., looks slow and choppy on the Pixel Tablet \u2014 as do any system animations,\u201d said the Digital Trends review of the slate.\n\nIt certainly didn\u2019t help that the software was brimming with bugs, the battery life was underwhelming, and the overall design was far less functionally thoughtful than what one expects from the Pixel team.\n\nGoogle is also said to have earmarked imaging upgrades for the Pixel Tablet 2. The front camera was reportedly upgraded to a 10-megapixel sensor (up from 8-megapixel on the first-gen Pixel Tablet), while the rear camera switched from an 8-megapixel unit to an 11-megapixel snapper.\n\n\u201cThe last upgrade Google was going to bring to the tablet was support for DisplayPort output up to 4K,\u201d adds the report. The company was reportedly planning an updated lineup of accessories for the tablet, including a keyboard case, as well.\n\nThe other noteworthy improvement was a bump in the battery size, going from 6,900mAh to 7,200mAh capacity. That\u2019s not exactly substantial, but for a tablet plagued by battery efficiency woes, any progress would have been welcome.\n\nNotably, the company hasn\u2019t entirely abandoned its tablet ambitions yet. In fact, work on a supposed Pixel Tablet 3 is reportedly underway, and a souped-up version targeting a 2026 launch is also said to be in the pipeline.\n\nWhat\u2019s worrisome is Google\u2019s historically lackadaisical approach to committing to a form factor and making iterative upgrades to it in the long run. The Pixel Tablet falls into one such category, even though Google has moved firmly into an adjacent one with its recent focus on folding phones \u2014 most recently, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\n\nAndroid, despite making significant progress with foldable-first software optimizations, still isn\u2019t quite ready for tablet computing. However, it seems the company\u2019s solution to that laggardness would be rather shocking.\n\nAs per Android Authority, Google is planning to unify Chrome OS into Android in hopes of competing with Apple\u2019s iPad and the iPad platform. Will that be enough to save the Pixel Tablet hopes? Only time will tell.\n\nIn hindsight, Google could snag two trophies in a single attempt by concentrating the efforts on maintaining two ailing platforms and injecting more energy into a unified Android-based architecture for large-screen devices."
