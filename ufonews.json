        "article_content": "A LEADING UFO campaigner has revealed whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris will finally reveal America's alien secrets.\n\nVeteran extraterrestrial lobbyist Steve Bassett wants the government to come clean about extraterrestrials in what he calls \"full disclosure\".\n\n11 Trump spoke about UFOs while in office, though he has made it clear it is not his 'thing' Credit: Reuters\n\n11 Harris has not made it clear whether she would release information on aliens Credit: AFP\n\n11 The US Department of Defense released footage of one UFO caught by a aircraft Credit: AFP\n\n11 Chilling footage caught on UFO from a plane Credit: youtube/LUFOS\n\nThe November 5 vote is set to be a pivotal moment for many policy issues - including the possible revelation of aliens.\n\nA stripped back bill was passed in December, ordering some records to be released within 25 years.\n\nThose releases could include more video and photos of unidentified craft and secret records dating back decades held by intelligence agencies.\n\nCongress has also held high-profile hearings over the last few years - and some in the capitol are talking about stronger legislation.\n\nBut if Congress passed a bill, the commander-in-chief would still have the option to veto it - making the 2024 presidential election a pivotal moment in UFO history.\n\nBassett told The Sun he thinks Kamala Harris would be more likely to release the secret files to the public than Donald Trump.\n\nHe says that's because the Democrats have pushed harder on getting a bill through Congress - and Harris would follow her party's line.\n\nThe Democrats and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have backed legislation saying the government should be willing to be \"transparent\" over the issue.\n\nBut Bassett thinks either candidate would ultimately release files if they were elected president.\n\nVideos of two incidents were shown to Congress as part of a landmark committee in 2022.\n\nMy grandad was at the Roswell UFO crash & he told us ALIEN bodies were found\n\nAnd officials admitted there were 400 unexplained sightings by the US military.\n\nHe said: \"A President Harris might come forward a little sooner and by sooner I mean like the day after the hearing is over, because the world is going to be on fire.\"\n\nAny revelation would only get to the President's desk after passing through Congress like any other law.\n\nBassett said: \"It's not about who is going to veto the bill. That's not an issue.\n\n\"It's going to be which president is most likely to step forward and confirm the ET presence.\"\n\nAfter the bill is passed, the pressure from the public will be so great that a sitting president would have no choice but to allow disclosure, Bassett claimed.\n\nHe said: \"The sooner they get in front of the people the better.\n\n\"We're one play away from ending this truth embargo 77 years after the press release in Roswell announcing that the Army Air Force had a crashed flying saucer.\n\n\"Those who are frustrated and leave the field right now are not going to get to join us in the in the locker room, but that's how close we are.\"\n\nThe sooner they get in front of the people the better\n\nAnother way disclosure of alien life could come would be if a Senate hearing with experts testifying came during the lame duck period.\n\nInstead of waiting for a new president and Congress, the current one would step forward in November or December and reveal the information, Bassett said.\n\nHe added: \"That hearing which I've described in countless interviews that I've given, it'll be one of the most important hearings in history, watched by millions.\n\n\"That sets the stage for President Biden to come forward and be the disclosure President by confirming what this hearing is just demonstrated.\n\n\"In which case Joe Biden would be the disclosure president.\n\n\"It would be an extraordinary legacy for him, and he would go out the door at the peak of his service to the country.\"\n\n11 Former DoD UFO worker David Grusch testifies before a House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing about UFOs Credit: EPA\n\n11 Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray plays a video of a UFO Credit: EPA\n\n11 Trump revealed aliens isn't 'his thing' in an interview with Joe Rogan Credit: Joe Rogan Experience\n\n11 Bassett said Joe Biden may also choose to release information during his lame duck period Credit: The Mega Agency\n\nTrump has spoken about aliens during the election campaign telling popular American podcaster Lex Fridman that he would \"surely\" make secret footage of alleged UFO sightings public.\n\nDuring the chat, Fridman asked Trump: \"Will you help push the Pentagon to release more footage, which a lot of people claim is available?\"\n\nTo which Trump readily agreed and said: \"Oh yeah, sure, I'll do that. I would do that. I'd love to do that. I have to do that.\"\n\nTrump also spoke about \"people coming from space\" with Joe Rogan in their three-hour interview.\n\nWhen Rogan asked Trump if he thought aliens were \"flying around\" he said there was \"no reason not to\".\n\nTrump said: \"There's no reason to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life.\"\n\nWhen Rogan suggested that some of the more recent sightings could have been advanced drones, Trump repeatedly says: \"could be\".\n\nTrump said: \"I interviewed a few people, it's never been my thing to be honest, I have never been a believer.\n\n\"It's not a great interest for me, but it's still of a little interest.\n\n\"I interviewed jet pilots that were solid people, perfect, great pilot great everything, they said: 'We saw things, sir, that were very strange'.\"\n\nTrump has previously commented on UFOs while in office when the Pentagon released three infrared videos of flying objects in 2020.\n\nHe said: \"I just wonder if it\u2019s real... that\u2019s a hell of a video.\"\n\nIn 2019, he told George Stephanopoulos that \"we\u2019re watching\" for aliens, \"and you\u2019ll be the first to know.\"\n\nThe Trump and Harris campaigns have been contacted for comment.\n\n11 Mexican journalist and UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan claims this specimen is not related to any known Earthly species Credit: Getty\n\n11 Steve Bassett is the only registered UFO lobbyist in Washington DC Credit: STEVE BASSETT"

Here\u2019s everything new in ChromeOS 130.\n\nWhat\u2019s New in ChromeOS 130?\n\nThe first major addition is the new Recorder app, which is rolling out to all Chromebooks. It looks quite similar to the one you find on Pixels with Material You theming and on-device transcription. On Chromebook Plus, you also get title suggestions and three-point summaries. The app seems to be rolling out to Chromebook Plus first, as we couldn\u2019t find it on our non-Plus unit.\n\nQuick Insert is another great feature rolling out in ChromeOS 130. The Galaxy Chromebook Plus is the first Chromebook to get a dedicated Quick Insert key. With this, you can now use a keyboard shortcut Launcher + F to emulate the same key on other Chromebooks.\n\nSimilarly, Focus Mode turns on DND and integrates Google Tasks in the UI, allowing you to work efficiently and be more productive without distractions. I\u2019ve tried the new Focus Mode, and it has how it helped me get things done quickly. So, I\u2019m sure you all will like it too.\n\nWelcome Recap is also rolling out in ChromeOS 130, and it shows you the files and apps you were working on before you last shut down your Chromebook. You can restore all the apps in a jiffy, and it can also serve as a reminder if you usually forget what you were working on last night.\n\nBesides, there\u2019s now support for multiple calendars, and an option to adjust keyboard backlight brightness in Settings. There\u2019s a similar slider in display settings with Ambient brightness control, but we couldn\u2019t find it on our Chromebook.\n\nImage Credit: Google\n\nAs for the Chromebook Plus-specific new AI features, there are two new features \u2014 Studio-style mic and Help me Read. The Studio-style mic feature is pretty straightforward. It uses AI to enhance the input sound quality and processes it to give it a studio feel.\n\nImage Credit: Google\n\nThe Help me read feature, on the other hand, also uses AI to summarize websites and PDFs. Users will see a text field where they can ask questions about the documents or pages and get summaries for the same.\n\nThat\u2019s not it. There are some other notable additions that Google has shared in its Chromebook support thread like the ability to access Google Drive files from the shelf, privacy controls that are more accessible in Chrome, and suggestions in Tote.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on ChromeOS 130? Let us know in the comments below."

The company did this by extending PostgreSQL for real-time analytics. Now Timescale brings AI to PostgreSQL with the pgai suite and the launch of pgai Vectorizer.\n\nManaging multiple tools Developers are under growing pressure to deliver AI systems such as search engines, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and AI agents. However, this often involves managing complex workflows across multiple tools: embedding creation, data processing and real-time synchronisation. New specialised tools emerge daily, adding infrastructure overhead and demanding new expertise, but few have the operational maturity or flexibility required for production. Pgai Vectorizer integrates the entire embedding process into PostgreSQL, allowing developers to create, store and manage vector embeddings alongside relational data without external tools or added infrastructure. Together with the full pgai suite, it integrates the entire AI workflow into PostgreSQL, simplifying complex workflows into a single system. This enables developers to build state-of-the-art AI applications with fewer resources using familiar SQL commands. \u201c[I feel that] pgai Vectorizer is a game-changer. It promises to streamline our entire AI workflow, from embedding creation to real-time synchronization, allowing us to deliver AI applications faster and more efficiently,\u201d said Web Begole, CTO at MarketReader.\u201cBy integrating everything directly into PostgreSQL, pgai Vectorizer removes the need for external tools and expertise, making it easier for our team to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure.\u201d Thousands of developers are already using the pgai suite of AI tools, and with pgai Vectorizer, they now have even greater power to streamline workflows and accelerate AI development."

        "article_content": "Gout is the most common arthritis, affecting men 3-4 times more than women.\n\nA significant scientific discovery has challenged the long-held notion that lifestyle variables such as diet and alcohol usage are the main causes of gout. The development of gout is significantly influenced by genetics, according to research from the University of Otago. They discovered particular genes that raise the risk of developing gout by examining the DNA of millions of people. This ground-breaking discovery casts doubt on the conventional wisdom of gout and creates new opportunities for creating more potent remedies and prophylactics.\n\nThe research that has been published in Nature Genetics found inherited genetics is an important part of why some people get gout and most others don't.\n\nSenior author Professor Tony Merriman, of Otago's Department of Microbiology and Immunology, hopes the findings will remove some of the stigma around gout.\n\n\"Gout is a chronic disease with a genetic basis and is not the fault of the sufferer-the myth that gout is caused by lifestyle or diet needs to be busted,\" he said.\n\n\"This widespread myth causes shame in people with gout, making some people more likely to suffer in silence and not go and see the doctor to get a preventive drug that lowers urate in the blood and will prevent their pain.\n\n\"People need to understand that while specific dietary factors, such as eating red meat, can trigger gout attacks, the fundamental cause is high urate levels, crystals in the joints, and an immune system primed to 'attack' the crystals-genetics plays an important role in all of these processes.\"\n\nThe research identified a large number of immune genes and immune pathways that provide new targets and approaches for preventing gout attacks.\n\nWhat is gout?\n\nAccording to the Foot Ankle Institute, gout is a type of arthritis that affects the musculoskeletal system, better known as your bones, joints, and muscles. It results from a buildup of uric acid in the joints. When there's an excess of uric acid in the blood, it crystalizes in the joints, usually the big toes. The most common gout symptoms include redness, tenderness, swelling, and pain."

        "article_content": "Samsung 990 Pro MSRP $180.00 Score Details \u201cLet's not mince words \u2014 the Samsung 990 Pro is insanely fast.\u201d Pros Crazy fast\n\nOptions with and without a heatsink\n\nCapacity up to 4TB\n\nSeveral features through Samsung Magician Cons Overkill for the PS5\n\nHeatsink is impractical for most\n\nI won\u2019t waste your time here. The Samsung 990 Pro is the best SSD you can buy right now. It\u2019s crazy fast, particularly when it comes to large file transfers, and despite a relatively high price, Samsung justifies the cost with extra features that few other brands go out of their way to fuss with.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe particular model I\u2019m looking at here, the Samsung 990 Pro 2TB with heatsink, may not be the right pick for everyone, though. Although it\u2019s a very fast drive, the extra cost of the heatsink and its slant toward expanding the storage inside the PlayStation 5 doesn\u2019t make sense, and you can save some money with a slower drive while achieving similar levels of gaming performance.\n\nPerformance outside of games is a different matter, however, which is where the 990 Pro truly stands out. If you want to learn more about SSD performance and how it varies between applications, make sure to check out our SSD buying guide.\n\nPricing and specs\n\n1TB 2TB 4TB Sequential read/write Up to 7,450MB/s, 6,900MB/s Up to 7,450MB/s, 6,900MB/s Up to 7,450MB/s, 6,900MB/s Random read/write Up to 1.2M IOPS, 1.55M IOPS Up to 1.4M IOPS, 1.55M IOPS Up to 1.6M IOPS, 1.55M IOPS Cache 1GB low power DDR4 2GB low power DDR4 4GB low power DDR4 Memory Samsung V-NAND 3-bit TLC Samsung V-NAND 3-bit TLC Samsung V-NAND 3-bit TLC Interface PCIe Gen 4.0 x4 PCIe Gen 4.0 x4 PCIe Gen 4.0 x4 Form factor M.2 2280 M.2 2280 M.2 2280 Max power consumption 7.8W 8.5W 8.6W Dimensions 80.15 x 25 x 8.88mm 80.15 x 25 x 8.88mm 80.15 x 25 x 8.88mm Price $130 $180 $330\n\nSamsung has remained the go-to brand for NVMe SSD for many years, and it\u2019s clear why. You\u2019re getting close to the maximum bandwidth of a PCIe 4.0 x4 interface, with Samsung touting sequential read speeds of up to 7,450MB/s. My testing backs up Samsung\u2019s claims, making this one of the fastest PCIe 4.0 SSDs you can currently buy.\n\nUnlike most other SSDs on the market, Samsung is using its own in-house NAND and controller for the 990 Pro, which generally makes it less prone to hardware swaps after launch. Other SSD brands that outsource NAND and controllers can run into supply issues and swap out components, sometimes at the cost of advertised speed. Thankfully, that\u2019s not the case here. You\u2019re also getting small amount of DDR4 as a cache, speeding up the performance of the drive.\n\nPricing is where things get interesting. This model of the 990 Pro is heavily targeted toward the PS5 due to having its own heatsink. That bit of extra metal drives up the price. At 2TB, you can save $10 by going with the 990 Pro model without a heatsink. And if you go up to 4TB, you\u2019ll save $30. That\u2019s compared to Samsung\u2019s own 990 Pro, too. If you shop for a drive like the WD Black SN850X, you\u2019ll get similar speeds for much less money \u2014 sans the heatsink.\n\nMost modern motherboards have heatsinks for the SSD drives, and in fact, the extra heatsink size can interfere with your other components. This is really a drive built for other applications, such as the PS5 Pro, or a mini PC with enough space but no heatsink, such as the Minisforum AtomMan G7 Ti.\n\nSoftware and features\n\nSamsung may have fast drives, but it also has excellent management software. I wouldn\u2019t blame you for ignoring the bundled software with most SSDs, but Samsung Magician has a lot of options, and it\u2019s worth taking up a bit of space to install the application.\n\nYou get some high-level stats, such as drive health, and you can perform a benchmark and diagnostic to see how your drive is performing. More importantly, Samsung gives you a ton of options to tweak the performance of your drive. You can turn on TRIM to let deleted blocks surface again for writing, as well as prevent the SSD from sleeping for maximum performance. Samsung also has over-provisioning options to increase the life span of the drive.\n\nBeyond performance, you have encryption options, data migration, and a proper erase function. This will restructure all of the data on the drive so it can\u2019t be recovered with forensics.\n\nPerformance\n\nSetting the scene, CrystalDiskMark shows that the 990 Pro with heatsink actually reaches a bit above Samsung\u2019s advertised speeds, both for sequential reads and writes. We\u2019re getting close to maxing out the available bandwidth on a PCIe 4.0 x4 interface, at least for sequential reads and writes. That\u2019s not what your drive is going to be doing most of the time, however.\n\nLooking at real applications provides some important context, as the margins between the 990 Pro 2TB and a much cheaper (and slower) drive like the WD Blue SN5000 shrink considerably. In large file transfers, which you can see in my AJA Video Systems test, the 990 Pro reigns supreme. There are some minor differences between the 1TB and 2TB models I tested, but not a big enough difference to note.\n\nSamsung 990 Pro 2TB w/ Heatsink WD Blue SN5000 4TB Samsung 990 Pro 1TB AJA Video Systems (read/write) 6,090 / 5,994MB/s 4,353 / 4,589MB/s 6,040 / 5,921MB/s PCMark 10 3,677 3,523 3,811 3DMark 3,372 3,621 3,650 Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail (seconds, lower is better) 7.59 seconds 7.11 seconds 7.24 seconds\n\nIn games, however, the 990 Pro 2TB with heatsink actually fell behind the pack. Both the SN5000 and regular 990 Pro posted better results in 3DMark \u2014 which actually loads games through the benchmark \u2014 and Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail. The 2TB 990 Pro isn\u2019t far behind, and when we\u2019re talking about margins of half a second, you\u2019ll never notice a meaningful difference in performance. On paper, however, it\u2019s a bit behind.\n\nShould you buy the Samsung 990 Pro?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for one of the fastest SSDs on the market for your PC, the Samsung 990 Pro hits that mark squarely. There\u2019s no doubt that the Samsung 990 Pro is a fast SSD, but I\u2019m not sure going with this specific model is the right call for the PS5. There are a couple of important reasons why.\n\nFirst, the heatsink. There are only a few instances where an SSD calls for a heatsink, and even in those cases, you probably won\u2019t reach damaging temperatures without one. If you plan on putting the 990 Pro inside a PC, save yourself some money and go with the heatsink-free model.\n\nThe bigger issue is the speed for gaming. This drive is heavily targeted toward the PS5, which is a platform that really can\u2019t take advantage of the extra speed on offer. In games, even the objectively slower SN5000 is putting up similar results, and you can pick up that drive for $120 \u2014 a clean $60 less than the 990 Pro 2TB with heatsink.\n\nThe best use case for a drive this fast isn\u2019t gaming \u2014 most PCIe 4.0 SSDs are plenty for gaming, with only minor differences in loading speed. The 990 Pro really shines when it comes to large file transfers, where its sustained speed advantage really shows up clearly. In that context, the 990 Pro is worth spending up for."
