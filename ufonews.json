            "article_content": "We need less uproar over everyday drones and more critical attention about ones near airports and other restricted airspace\n\nDecember\u2019s spate of drone sightings seen in New Jersey and spreading nationwide, sure looks familiar. As does its associated media frenzy\u2014culminating in memes and conspiracy theories about so-called \u201cmystery drones.\u201d The episode bears an eerie resemblance to the UFO phenomenon, or the unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) one, that spiked in recent years and has led to significant congressional attention and legislation.\n\nIn a way, this is progress. The reason this outbreak looks so familiar is that such drone sightings would previously have been identified as UAP ones. It\u2019s only after years of concerted efforts in education, and transparency by U.S. Department of Defense officials, that UAP sightings have rightfully evolved into common drone identification. That is not to say that the drone sightings are any less of a concern, but fortunately, we can address them without the contagion of the UFO community and the conspiracies associated with it.\n\nUnfortunately, our response has been no less irrational.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nA New Jersey state assemblyman has accused federal officials of \u201clying to us\u201d about drones on CNN. The president-elect suggested we \u201cshoot them down!!!\u201d which is almost (but only almost, sadly) needless to say, a bad idea. So is wasting resources to investigate nonsensical notions of advanced technology related to Iran or, again, aliens. Calls for shooting objects down not only have obvious safety issues but fail to recall that Congress and the White House limited such strikes over U.S. territory after the incidents involving the Chinese high-altitude balloon and other balloons, based on concerns about civilian safety.\n\nThere are a couple of things we need to make clear about the drone sightings. First, many of the sightings remain mistaken interpretations of manned aircraft or satellites such as Starlink ones. The real drone sightings fall into two classes: those that are in restricted airspace, and those that are in legal airspace. Restricted airspace surrounds airports as well as national security areas such as Air Force and Navy bases. Most sightings reported fall within the latter category and have been assessed as having no immediate national security or flight safety risk, although the public finds them annoying.\n\nOne fact that many people tend to overlook, or at least don\u2019t readily rationalize, is that these drones have lights on them. That lights are present on various flying objects including drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs) is a fact I often referred to in my last job, heading a Pentagon office investigating UAP sightings. Lights on a drone are for collision avoidance. They are a safety feature. Flying drones with lights ensures they can be seen; if they were meant to be unnoticed, the operators would turn off or disable the lights. In September 2023, the FAA changed the rules to allow drones to fly at night this way, and this is likely a contributing factor to the increase in sightings. The public and elected officials in Congress continue to believe lights in the sky are scary, however, particularly when they mistake crewed aircraft for drones.\n\nCongressional officials and that unfortunate source of information, social media, continue to make unfounded claims of drone technologies far ahead of U.S. capabilities. The most recent example being the assertion that drones flew from an Iranian mother ship off the coast of the U.S. and demonstrated seven or eight hours of battery life. That fantastic assertion requires there to be evidence that the drones originated from an Iranian ship and were tracked continuously to the U.S. cities. There are no such tracks. The more rational explanation is that they originated near the place of the sighting, that is from domestic operators.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean some drone operations aren\u2019t ill-intentioned.\n\nSeveral hypotheses (apart from mistaken identity) might explain these drones in legal airspace. They might be academic, professional or hobbyist domestic operators exploring a new technology. YouTube overflows with drone footage from amateur photographers all over the world. Flying in urban settings, in legal airspace, for photography or maybe even some research such as high resolution thermal or pollution measurements is very plausible. Or they are commercial. Increased commercial activity is unavoidable as industry advances drone technology for delivery, remote sensing and communications.\n\nMore concerning, operators could be probing the limits of legal activities, or in military speak, performing or exploring preparation of the battlespace. Whether foreign or domestic bad actors, they could be flying commercial drones, complete with lights, to test reactions of both the public and the government. As long as they are flying within legal airspace, under legal limits, they can push those limits and measure what the reaction is. That information on reactions and response could readily feed back to some sort of attack planning, illegal drug delivery or other malicious intent.\n\nFinally, the operators could be using them intentionally to whip up frenzy, hysteria and panic. It could be for personal gain (such as claiming they have the anti-UAV solution to sell), or perhaps advertising something resembling another History Channel series on aliens.\n\nMuch like the UAP problem, there is little evidence to support, or rule out, any of these hypotheses. Like UAP, the drones don\u2019t likely all have the same explanation. That makes it hard from a national security perspective to distinguish when a sighting is benign versus potentially nefarious. Lest we forget the lessons of the ongoing war on Ukraine, we don\u2019t want to be caught in an intelligence or technical surprise.\n\nMeanwhile, the sightings that are clearly in restricted airspace usually have more obvious intentions. These can range from benign to nefarious, but generally center around seeing things that are normally not allowed. Whether this is military aircraft, commercial airports or operations, these clearly identified drones and balloons with payloads pose not only a security risk but also a flight safety risk. It would only take one small quad copter to get sucked into a commercial jet engine to end in tragedy.\n\nThe proliferation of drone technology, in its commercial, recreational, scientific and military uses, is clearly disrupting the world around us. Our legislation and regulation have created an environment that allows for legal drone usage. It should come as no surprise then that drones are in the air and increasing. Yet here we are, once again with more extraordinary claims, public demands for transparency, baseless accusations of hiding the truth, and congressional calls for more legislation over a mystery in the sky, instead of a rational scientific approach to the investigation. Sound familiar?\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

Multiple countries have been known to be attempting to develop a sixth-generation fighter, including China, the US and Russia. Other countries have joined forces on sixth-gen projects, such as the UK, Japan and Italy in the Global Combat Air Programme, and France, Germany and Spain with FCAS. Sixth-generation fighter concepts share several distinct characteristics, such as the inclusion of AI and advanced stealth capabilities. If the jet spotted in the video footage is indeed a sixth-generation fighter jet, then China appears to have taken a significant step forward at the front of the race. The debut of the J-36 jet challenges US superiority in the skies and could have serious implications for India, which currently lacks a stealth fighter jet. It is anticipated the US will deploy its first sixth-generation fighter to the field around 2030.\n\n6 The new jet, on the left, accompanied by a Chinese Chengdu J-20S Credit: X\n\nThe demo of the new plane comes just a month after China unveiled the J-35 fighter jet, which bore a striking similarity to an American design, the F-35.\n\nIt was even claimed that the fifth generation fighter was built from designs for the American craft which were stolen by Xi Jinping's agents.\n\nAt the airshow the China released plans for a mysterious \"White Emperor\" jet design - capable of dropping devastating weapons from space.\n\nHowever, it is not thought this was the design captured in the recent footage.\n\nChina is also vying to take on the US \"Son of Concorde\" with an even faster supersonic jet that could blast from London to New York City in less than two hours.\n\nBeijing-based Space Transportation - also known as Lingkong Tianxing Technology - has been carrying out test flights and recently reached a speed of 3,106 mph which is four times the speed of sound, according to Chinese media.\n\n6 There has been no official information released about the new jet Credit: X"

Ft. / 11 KG\n\nEnergy Efficiency: Energy Star / A-Rated\n\nSettings: Sanitize, linen, eco, AI, and countless more\n\nNoise level: 53 dB\n\nMatching dryer? Yes\n\nWarranty: Parts and labor included for 1 year\n\nDimensions: H 38\" x W 27\" x D 34\"\n\nI recently became a homeowner for the first time, and was fortunate enough to be left an old but functional washing machine when we moved in. Sure, our black jeans came out covered in mysterious white fluff, and stains took two or three wash cycles to fully remove, but it did the job, and that's all you can ask of a washing machine, right? Wrong. Since upgrading to the Samsung Bespoke Smart Front Load Washer, known as the Samsung Series 8 AI Energy Washing Machine in the U.K. (where I'm based), I've learned that I was putting up with a poor washing performance for far too long.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Samsung Bespoke looks fabulous. Our plumber was enamored when he fitted it, commenting that it was the quietest washing machine he'd ever fitted, and he loved the smart controls. We didn't get the matching dryer, but the set is stackable and looks virtually identical.\n\nI'm not the most tech-savvy Home Editor out there, so I was concerned that I'd find Samsung's AI features and app compatibility a little overwhelming. In fact, this is one of those smart home products that can actually make your life easier. Here's why I think it's one of the best washing machines out there.\n\nPrice and availability\n\nIn the U.S., this machine is called the Bespoke 5.3 cu. ft. Ultra Capacity Front Load Washer and it retails for $1,423 direct from Samsung (although at time of writing, it's down to $999). You can also find it at Best Buy and it comes in a range of colors including Brushed Black (the one I tested) and Stainless Steel. At Samsung, you can also find it in Khaki.\n\nI'm based in the U.K., where this machine is called the Samsung Series 8 AI Energy Washing Machine and retails for \u00a3799. You can also find it at Curry's and AO. There's only one notable difference, which is that where the power button sits on the Series 8, you'll find synced controls for washing and drying in the U.S. model. Samsung told me that this is to cater to regional differences, but that the settings and design are otherwise the same.\n\nFirst impressions\n\nSamsung series 8 open\n\nThis machine has a 5.3 Cu. Ft. / 11KG capacity that will happily cater to most families. I purchased the brushed black version, which (as you can see in the photo above) is quite reflective. The darkened glass on the washing machine door makes it look particularly sleek and modern, and the brushed touchscreen control panel is incredibly intuitive to use.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Samsung Bespoke has automatic detergent and fabric softener dispensers which you can fill when you set the machine up, and which then auto-dispense a custom amount depending on the weight of your laundry and setting you choose. I'm totally sold on this feature, and I don't think I'd ever go back to dosing every single wash with detergent and softener. It's just one less thing to worry about.\n\nSamsung series 8 dispensers\n\nHowever, because of how much I hated dosing detergent and softener in my old machine, I had switched to laundry pods when I started using it. This meant I had a large backlog to get through with this machine, so while I've been using liquid fabric softener, I've yet to add any detergent to the dispenser as I've been throwing in a pod manually. And there's no option to tell the machine this, so it still warns me every time I use it that I need to top up on detergent. Overriding this is easy enough, but if you swear by a certain brand of pods, you might get annoyed at having this alert pop up every time you switch the machine on and every time you open the app.\n\nSettings\n\nMy last washing machine had dials for temperature, RPM, and a few pre-set washing modes that you could see all at once. Perhaps the main downside of this machine is the myriad options you'll scroll through before deciding on the right one for you. When I first used it, I used the dial to flick through setting options for my linen sheets. There's a linen setting, and a bedding setting, but no way of seeing every option all at once, so you'll have to remember your go-to settings when you go to use this machine.\n\nImage 1 of 4\n\nSamsung series 8 AI wash\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage 2 of 4\n\nSamsung series 8 super speed\n\nImage 3 of 4\n\nSamsung series 8 steam\n\nImage 4 of 4\n\nSamsung series 8 refill\n\nI was also struck that the length of each setting isn't shown as you scroll through. The time is one of the main factors I consider when, for example, I put on some sheets before I start work and want them to be finished by the time I have my lunch break, so this seemed like an omission.\n\nAs it happens, if you pause on a setting instead of scrolling right past it, the screen will display the time taken, so you'll just need some patience (or use the app) if this is a big consideration for you.\n\nApp controls\n\nSamsung series 8 AI washer app\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou'll need the SmartThings app to connect to your washing machine on your phone. This is made easier by a QR code on the front of the door, which took me straight to my SmartThings app (I have a Samsung phone, which might have made things smoother) and set up a connection between my phone and the washing machine.\n\nFrom there, you can choose which room it's in (yes, mine's in the kitchen, we do that here!) as well as monitoring energy consumption and accessing personalized care information.\n\nSamsung series 8 AI washer app\n\nThe app allows you to download new wash cycles to your machine and adjust them manually. You can also start monitor your wash cycle from your app, and it notifies you when your washing is done if, by some miracle, you don't hear the world's longest jingle sound when the cycle is finished.\n\nPerformance\n\nI've washed everything from dirty socks to crusty towels in the Samsung Bespoke washing machine and they've all come out spotless on the first wash. One of the biggest issues I had in my old washing machine was when washing dark items like black jeans or shirts. They'd often come out covered in lint and white fibers as if I'd put a tissue through the wash with them. Despite cleaning the machine and meticulously emptying pockets, I could never get my dark clothes to come out spotless.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMy suspicion that my washing machine was to blame for this problem was confirmed when I switched to the Samsung Bespoke. My jeans looked actually black for the first time in a year, and my partner finally could go back to wearing black and navy shirts to work.\n\nImage 1 of 2\n\nDishcloth after being cleaned in the Samsung Series 8\n\nCloths after being cleaned in the Samsung Series 8\n\nImage 2 of 2\n\nSamsung series 8 before cleaning dishcloths\n\nCloths before being cleaned in the Samsung Series 8\n\nI'm often skeptical when it comes to smart features in large appliances. What are the odds that I'll actually use a setting that lets my fridge make me a shopping list, or that lets me watch the inside of my oven as it cooks?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWith the Samsung Bespoke, I can see the difference that its AI tech makes. In sensing the weight of my laundry and automatically dosing the correct amount of detergent, it always makes my sheets come out smelling fresh, and guides me through any maintenance required.\n\nHow does it compare?\n\nI measured noise levels when using this machine and found that it hit highs of 54dB, which is incredibly quiet for a washing machine. We've not tested it hands-on, but the Electrolux ELFW7537AT is also praised for being quiet by countless reviews. However, it doesn't offer app control and it's also restricted by a 4.2 Cu. Ft. capacity, making it significantly smaller than the Samsung Bespoke.\n\nIf app control is important to you, we also recommend the LG WM4200H, which offers a 5 cu. ft. capacity and retails for a similar price of $1,349. However, some users complain that their laundry can get tangled up easily in this machine, which isn't an issue I encountered with the Samsung Bespoke.\n\nVerdict\n\nI didn't upgrade my washing machine sooner because I didn't understand just how much of a difference a high-spec machine can make, and now I do, I wouldn't stray from my Samsung Bespoke. There are cheaper machines on the market, and sometimes I miss the ability to see all my cycle options at once, but the tradeoff for that is a very sleek and uncluttered control panel that I'm proud to display in my home.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOn top of that, the cleaning performance in this machine is practically faultless, and its smart features do actually make a huge difference in both the ease of use and performance for this machine. If you've got a decent budget and are hoping to upgrade, look no further."

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules of innovation, with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, and Alphabet's Gemini demonstrating remarkable abilities across domains. However, a recent study titled \"Age Against the Machine - Susceptibility of Large Language Models to Cognitive Impairment: Cross-Sectional Analysis\", published in the BMJ (British Medical Journal), challenges the assumption that AI tools can flawlessly replace human professionals, particularly in medicine. Conducted by researchers from Hadassah Medical Center and Tel Aviv University, the study explored the \"cognitive abilities\" of leading LLMs using established neurological tests like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).\n\nThe findings reveal a nuanced perspective on AI's strengths and limitations. While these models excel at many tasks, they show significant weaknesses in visuospatial and executive functions, raising questions about their reliability in critical applications such as healthcare diagnostics.\n\nCognitive decline in AI\n\nThe study evaluated five large language models - ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.0, and Gemini 1.5 - by administering the MoCA test, a tool used to detect cognitive impairments in humans. The test includes tasks that assess attention, memory, language, and executive functions, providing a maximum score of 30 points. To complement the MoCA test, the researchers also employed tools like the Stroop test and visuospatial diagnostics, including the Navon figure and Poppelreuter figure.\n\nResults showed that ChatGPT 4o achieved the highest MoCA score (26/30), followed by ChatGPT 4 and Claude (25/30), while Gemini 1.0 scored the lowest (16/30), indicating signs of mild cognitive impairment. Despite their strong performance in areas like attention and language, all models struggled with visuospatial and executive tasks, such as the trail-making and cube-copying exercises. Notably, ChatGPT 4o was the only model to successfully complete the incongruent stage of the Stroop test, further emphasizing the disparity in performance across cognitive domains.\n\nThe study revealed several critical insights about the limitations of AI systems:\n\nVisuospatial Deficits: All models displayed difficulty with tasks requiring visuospatial reasoning. For instance, none could complete the clock-drawing test accurately, a common indicator of cognitive decline in humans. These deficits suggest that current LLMs are ill-equipped to handle tasks requiring visual abstraction and executive function.\n\nAge-Related Cognitive Decline: The study highlighted a striking parallel between human aging and AI model updates. \"Older\" versions of LLMs, such as Gemini 1.0, performed worse than their \"younger\" counterparts like Gemini 1.5. This finding raises questions about the longevity and reliability of AI models over time.\n\nEmpathy and Contextual Understanding: When tested with visual cues like the cookie theft scene, none of the models demonstrated concern for the depicted scenario, such as a boy about to fall. This absence of empathy underscores the limitations of AI in understanding nuanced human contexts, particularly in fields requiring emotional intelligence, like healthcare.\n\nCan AI Replace human physicians?\n\nIn recent years, LLMs have shown remarkable potential in medical applications, outperforming human doctors in various board examinations. Yet, this study challenges the narrative of AI's infallibility in clinical roles. For example, the inability to perform visuospatial tasks or exhibit contextual awareness diminishes their reliability in medical diagnostics. Patients may question the competence of an AI tool that struggles with tasks it is designed to evaluate, potentially undermining trust in AI-driven healthcare systems.\n\nFurthermore, the findings emphasize the need for caution when integrating AI into clinical workflows. While LLMs can enhance efficiency and provide supplementary insights, they lack the holistic understanding and adaptability of human physicians, particularly in complex or ambiguous scenarios.\n\nThe study's findings extend beyond healthcare. The limitations observed in LLMs' cognitive abilities reflect broader challenges in AI development. While these models excel at processing large datasets and generating coherent textual outputs, their struggles with visuospatial reasoning and contextual tasks highlight a critical gap in their design.\n\nAddressing these limitations will require advancements in the integration of multimodal capabilities, allowing AI systems to process and interpret both textual and visual data more effectively. Additionally, developers must prioritize ethical considerations, ensuring that AI tools are transparent about their capabilities and limitations to prevent misuse.\n\nA call for ethical and collaborative AI development\n\nThe researchers advocate for a collaborative approach to AI development, combining human expertise with machine efficiency. They emphasize the importance of creating systems that augment human capabilities rather than attempting to replace them. In healthcare, for instance, AI can assist with preliminary diagnoses or administrative tasks, freeing up physicians to focus on patient care.\n\nThe study also calls for increased transparency and public engagement in AI research. By involving stakeholders from diverse fields, developers can create tools that are both effective and ethical, addressing societal concerns about the potential misuse of AI technologies.\n\nTo put it succinctly, while LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini demonstrate impressive capabilities, their struggles with visuospatial and contextual tasks highlight the gap between machine intelligence and human cognition. These findings challenge the assumption that AI will seamlessly replace human professionals, particularly in fields like medicine."

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nThe feature is currently available to limited users\n\nWhat is YouTube's 'Play something' feature and how it works\n\nBy Dwaipayan Roy 11:42 am Dec 28, 202411:42 am\n\nWhat's the story YouTube has announced a new feature aimed at improving user experience on its platform. The video-sharing giant has added a \"Play something\" button in its Android app, 9to5Google reported. The feature, which is still in the testing stage, plays random videos according to your viewing preferences and habits. This may include both Shorts and normal videos.\n\nUsage\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe \"Play something\" button appears in the lower right corner of the UI on YouTube's Android app. Tapping on it will play a random YouTube Short matching your preferences. However, the next videos triggered by the feature may not be Shorts. The feature is not widely available yet and has only been spotted on the Brazilian version of the app.\n\nFeature evolution\n\nA step toward seamless content discovery\n\nThe current 'Play something' button is an evolved version of a similar feature tested last year. The previous version was embedded into the home screen feed, while the latest iteration seems to be a permanent fixture in the UI. This development indicates YouTube's ongoing efforts to streamline content discovery and consumption for its users, by reducing decision-making friction when opening the app.\n\nAvailability\n\nLimited rollout of the new feature\n\nThe new 'Play something' button has been spotted in version 19.5 of the YouTube Android app. However, it is not yet available for all users running this version, suggesting a limited rollout at this stage. This strategy is in line with YouTube's usual practice of gradually introducing new features to its user base."

Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness.\"\n\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox.> Sign up for NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe pressure on OpenAI is tied to its $157 billion valuation, achieved in the two years since the company launched its viral chatbot, ChatGPT, and kicked off the boom in generative artificial intelligence. OpenAI closed its latest $6.6 billion round in October, gearing up to aggressively compete with Elon Musk's xAI as well as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Anthropic in a market that's predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\n\nDeveloping the large language models at the heart of ChatGPT and other generative AI products requires an ongoing investment in high-powered processors, provided largely by Nvidia, and cloud infrastructure, which OpenAI largely receives from top backer Microsoft.\n\nOpenAI expects about $5 billion in losses on $3.7 billion in revenue this year, CNBC confirmed in September. Those numbers are increasing rapidly.\n\nBy transforming into a Delaware PBC \"with ordinary shares of stock,\" OpenAI says it can pursue commercial operations, while separately hiring a staff for its nonprofit arm and allowing that wing to take on charitable activities in health care, education and science.\n\nThe nonprofit will have a \"significant interest\" in the PBC \"at a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors,\" OpenAI wrote.\n\nOpenAI's complicated structure as it exists today is the result of its creation as a nonprofit in 2015. It was founded by CEO Sam Altman, Musk and others as a research lab focused on artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which was an entirely futuristic concept at the time.\n\nIn 2019, OpenAI aimed to move past its role as solely a research lab in hopes of functioning more like a startup, so it created a so-called capped-profit model, with the nonprofit still controlling the overall entity.\n\n\"Our current structure does not allow the Board to directly consider the interests of those who would finance the mission and does not enable the nonprofit to easily do more than control the for-profit,\" OpenAI wrote in Friday's post.\n\nOpenAI added that the change would \"enable us to raise the necessary capital with conventional terms like our competitors.\"\n\nMusk's opposition\n\nOpenAI's efforts to restructure face some major hurdles. The most significant is Musk, who is in the midst of a heated legal battle with Altman that could have a significant impact on the company's future.\n\nIn recent months, Musk has sued OpenAI and asked a court to stop the company from converting to a for-profit corporation from a nonprofit. In posts on X, he described that effort as a \"total scam\" and claimed that \"OpenAI is evil.\" Earlier this month, OpenAI clapped back, alleging that in 2017 Musk \"not only wanted, but actually created, a for-profit\" to serve as the company's proposed new structure.\n\nIn addition to its face-off with Musk, OpenAI has been dealing with an outflow of high-level talent, due in part to concerns that the company has focused on taking commercial products to market at the expense of safety.\n\nIn late September, OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati announced she would depart the company after 6\u00bd years. That same day, research chief Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, a research vice president, also announced they were leaving. A month earlier, co-founder John Schulman said he was leaving for rival startup Anthropic.\n\nAltman said during a September interview at Italian Tech Week that recent executive departures were not related to the company's potential restructuring: \"We have been thinking about that \u2014 our board has \u2014 for almost a year independently, as we think about what it takes to get to our next stage,\" he said.\n\nThose weren't the first big-name exits. In May, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and former safety leader Jan Leike announced their departures, with Leike also joining Anthropic.\n\nLeike wrote in a social media post at the time that disagreements with leadership about company priorities drove his decision.\n\n\"Over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products,\" he wrote.\n\nOne employee, who worked under Leike, quit soon after him, writing on X in September that \"OpenAI was structured as a non-profit, but it acted like a for-profit.\" The employee added, \"You should not believe OpenAI when it promises to do the right thing later.\"\n\nWATCH: OpenAI announces o3 and o3 mini models"

            "article_content": "Sam Altman and deputies at OpenAI discuss the performance of the new o3 model on the ARC-AGI test. OpenAI/ZDNET\n\nThe latest large language model from OpenAI isn't yet in the wild, but we already have some ways to tell what it can and cannot do.\n\nThe \"o3\" release from OpenAI was unveiled on Dec. 20 in the form of a video infomercial, which means that most people outside the company have no idea what it really is capable of. (Outside safety testing parties are being given early access.)\n\nAlso: 15 ways AI saved me time at work in 2024\n\nAlthough the video featured a lot of discussion of various benchmark achievements, the message from OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman on the video was very brief. His biggest statement, and vague at that, was that o3 \"is an incredibly smart model.\"\n\nARC-AGI put o3 to the test\n\nOpenAI plans to release the \"mini\" version of o3 toward the end of January and the full version sometime after that, said Altman.\n\nOne outsider, however, has had the chance to put o3 to the test, in a sense.\n\nThe test, in this case, is called the \"Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence,\" or ARC-AGI. It is a collection of \"challenges for intelligent systems,\" a new benchmark. The ARC-AGI is billed as \"the only benchmark specifically designed to measure adaptability to novelty.\" That means that it is meant to test the acquisition of new skills, not just the use of memorized knowledge.\n\nAlso: Why ethics is becoming AI's biggest challenge\n\nAGI, artificial general intelligence, is regarded by some in AI as the Holy Grail -- the achievement of a level of machine intelligence that could equal or exceed human intelligence. The idea of ARC-AGI is to guide AI toward \"more intelligent and more human-like artificial systems.\"\n\nThe o3 model scored 76% accuracy on ARC-AGI in an evaluation formally coordinated by OpenAI and the author of ARC-AGI, Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, a scientist in Google's artificial intelligence unit.\n\nA shift in AI capabilities\n\nOn the website of ARC-AGI, Chollet wrote this past week that the score of 76% is the first time AI has beaten a human's score on the exam, as exemplified by the answers of human Mechanical Turk workers who took the test and who, on average, scored just above 75% correct.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Chollet, inventor of ARC-AGI, says that the amount of activity going on with o3 suggests it is using a completely different architecture than its GPT-4 predecessors. Fran\u00e7ois Chollet\n\nChollet wrote that the high score is \"a surprising and important step-function increase in AI capabilities, showing novel task adaptation ability never seen before in the GPT-family models.\" He added, \"All intuition about AI capabilities will need to get updated for o3.\"\n\nThe achievement marks \"a genuine breakthrough\" and \"a qualitative shift in AI capabilities,\" declared Chollet. Chollet predicts that o3's ability to \"adapt to tasks it has never encountered before\" means that \"you should plan for these capabilities to become competitive with human work within a fairly short timeline.\"\n\nChollet's remarks are noteworthy because he has never been a cheerleader of AI. In 2019, when he created ARC-AGI, he told me in an interview we had for ZDNET that the steady stream of \"bombastic press articles\" from AI companies \"misleadingly suggest that human-level AI is perhaps a few years away,\" while he considered such hyperbole \"an illusion.\"\n\nThe ARC-AGI questions are easy for people to understand and fairly easy for people to solve. Each challenge shows three to five examples of the question and the right answer, and the test taker is then presented with a similar question and asked to supply the missing answer.\n\nThe basic form of ARC-AGI is to have three to five examples of input and output, which represent the question and its answer, and then a final example of input for which the answer needs to be supplied by providing the right output picture. It's pretty easy for a human to figure out what picture to produce by tapping on colored pixels, even if they cannot articulate the rule per se. ARCPrize\n\nThe questions are not text-based but instead consist of pictures. A grid of pixels with colored shapes is first shown, followed by a second version that has been changed in some way. The question is: What is the rule that changes the initial picture into the second picture?\n\nIn other words, the challenge doesn't directly rely on natural language, the celebrated area of large language models. Instead, it tests abstract pattern formulation in the visual domain.\n\nTry ARC-AGI for yourself\n\nYou can try out the ARC-AGI for yourself at Chollet's challenge website. You answer the challenge by \"drawing\" in an empty grid, filling in each pixel with the right color to create the correct grid of colored pixels as the \"answer.\"\n\nIt's fun, rather like playing Sudoku or Tetris. Chances are, even if you can't verbally articulate what the rule is, you'll figure out pretty quickly what boxes need to be colored in to produce the solution. The most time-consuming part is actually tapping on each pixel in the grid to assign its color.\n\nAlso: Why Google's quantum breakthrough is 'truly remarkable' - and what happens next\n\nA correct answer produces a confetti toss animation on the webpage and the message, \"You've solved the ARC Prize Daily Puzzle. You are still more (generally) intelligent than AI.\"\n\nNote when o3 or any other model takes the test, it doesn't directly act on pixels. Instead, the equivalent is fed to the machine as a matrix of rows and columns of numbers that must be transformed into a different matrix as the answer. Hence, AI models don't \"see\" the test the same way a human does.\n\nWhat's still not clear\n\nDespite o3's achievement, it's hard to make definitive statements about o3's capabilities. Because OpenAI's model is closed-source, it's still not clear exactly how the model is solving the challenge.\n\nNot being part of OpenAI, Chollet has to speculate as to how o3 is doing what it's doing.\n\nHe conjectures the achievement is a result of OpenAI changing the \"architecture\" of o3 from that of its predecessors. An architecture in AI refers to the arrangement and relationship of the functional elements that give code its structure.\n\nAlso: If ChatGPT produces AI-generated code for your app, who does it really belong to?\n\nChollet speculates on the blog \"at test time, the model searches over the space of possible Chains of Thought (CoTs) describing the steps required to solve the task, in a fashion perhaps not too dissimilar to AlphaZero-style Monte Carlo tree search.\"\n\nThe term chain of thought refers to an increasingly popular approach in generative AI in which the AI model can detail the sequence of calculations it performs in pursuit of the final answer. AlphaZero is Google's DeepMind unit's famous AI program that beat humans at chess in 2016. A Monte Carlo Tree Search is a decades-old computer science approach.\n\nIn an email exchange, Chollet told me a bit more about his thinking. I asked how he arrived at that idea of a search over chains of thought. \"Clearly when the model is 'thinking' for hours and generating millions of tokens in the process of solving a single puzzle, it must be doing some kind of search,\" replied Chollet.\n\nChollet added:\n\nIt is completely obvious from the latency/cost characteristics of the model that it is doing something completely different from the GPT series. It's not the same architecture, nor in fact anything remotely close. The defining factor of the new system is a huge amount of test-time search. Previously, 4 years of scaling up the same architecture (the GPT series) had yielded no progress on ARC, and now this system which clearly has a new architecture is creating a step function change in capabilities, so architecture is everything.\n\nThere are a number of caveats here. OpenAI didn't disclose how much money was spent on one of its versions of o3 to solve ARC-AGI. That's a significant omission because one criterion of ARC-AGI is the cost in real dollars of using GPU chips as a proxy for AI model \"efficiency.\"\n\nChollet told me in an email that the approach of o3 does not amount to a \"brute force\" approach, but, he quipped, \"Of course, you could also define brute force as 'throwing an inordinate amount of compute at a simple problem,' in which case you could say it's brute force.\"\n\nAlso, Chollet notes that o3 was trained to take the ARC-AGI test using the competition's training data set. That means it's not yet clear how a clean version of o3, with no test prep, would approach the exam.\n\nAlso: OpenAI's Sora AI video generator is here - how to try it\n\nChollet told me in an email, \"It will be interesting to see what the base system scores with no ARC-related information, but in any case the fact that the system is fine-tuned for ARC via the training set does not invalidate its performance. That's what the training set is for. Until now no one was able to achieve similar scores, even after training on millions of generated ARC tasks.\"\n\no3 still fails on some easy tasks\n\nDespite the uncertainty, one thing seems very clear: Those yearning for AGI will be disappointed. Chollet emphasizes that the ARC-AGI test is \"a research tool\" and that \"Passing ARC-AGI does not equate to achieving AGI.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I don't think o3 is AGI yet,\" Chollet writes on the ARC-AGI blog. \"o3 still fails on some very easy tasks, indicating fundamental differences with human intelligence.\"\n\nTo demonstrate we are still not at human-level intelligence, Chollet notes some of the simple problems in ARC-AGI that o3 can't solve. One such problem involves simply moving a colored square by a given amount -- a pattern that quickly becomes clear to a human.\n\nAn example problem from ARC-AGI where the o3 model failed. ARCPrize\n\nChollet plans to unveil a new version of ARC-AGI in January. He predicts it will drastically reduce o3's results. \"You'll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible,\" he concludes."

            "article_content": "Payments trends in 2024 and beyond are largely impacted by technology and the state of the economy. We\u2019re seeing a decline in discretionary spending, and an increase in the number of ways consumers like to make payments. Plus, AI and biometrics are also impacting payment security and fraud prevention.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll walk you through a few digital payment trends\u200b to watch as you prepare your business for the future of payment processing.\n\n1. Diversified payment methods\n\nOne of the more well-known global payment trends\u200b is payment method diversity. There are so many ways to make payments these days. I can choose cash, card, mobile app, QR code, tap to pay, buy now and pay later (BNPL), or even cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to a survey by Square, preferences are pretty widespread across the board. While 58% of consumers still use cash, 57% prefer mobile wallets, and 53% use QR code payments. Another 44% use traditional credit and debit cards, 44% use touchless card payments, and 43% use BNPL.\n\nBNPL is particularly notable, as it\u2019s now being adopted in more industry verticals than before. Groceries, for example, may be available for purchase via BNPL. In fact, BNPL grocery purchases increased by 40% between 2023 and 2024, according to Deloitte. This is a direct response to the current economic and political climate, which is causing a decrease in discretionary spending.\n\nThe list of payment options will only continue to grow as the economy moves further away from cash and check and towards innovative payment methods like NFC or biometric payments. This also means considering options like subscriptions, cryptocurrency, saved payments, bill splitting, peer-to-peer (P2P), and gift cards.\n\nHere\u2019s another interesting stat from Deloitte: 70% of consumers say their store choice is highly influenced by whether or not the store offers their preferred payment method. It is therefore important for businesses to keep up.\n\nRelated: Best crypto payment gateways\n\nCash vs cashless\n\nToday\u2019s consumers like convenience and options. I remember when it was just a cash or credit world\u2014now, consumers can choose to pay for their purchases in many ways.\n\nHowever, according to data from Square, about 58% of shoppers still prefer cash. In fact, some trends are even indicating a move back to cash and away from digitization.\n\nSo, there\u2019s really no clear winner in a cash vs. cashless debate. The real answer for businesses is to create ways to allow customers to pay with or without cash.\n\nRelated: What is a cashless society? From speculation to near-reality\n\nMobile payments and digital wallets\n\nMobile payments and digital wallets\u2014like Apple Pay and Google Pay\u2014are another payment trend that has been around for a while but continues to impact businesses everywhere, especially as this technology evolves.\n\nPer Deloitte, 57% of consumers prefer to pay with mobile wallet apps. Digital wallets actually made up 37% of transaction value for e-commerce payments and 15% of POS payments in North America in 2023.\n\nContactless pay can also fall under the category of mobile payments. Mobile payments involve the use of NFC technology so a customer can hold up their phone or smartwatch to the reader rather than having to insert a chip or swipe a card. The contactless payment market is also expected to see major growth\u2014at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 113% through 2029, according to Juniper Research.\n\nRelated: Top mobile payment methods\n\nCrypto payments\n\nCryptocurrency payments skyrocketed in popularity when they were first introduced. The trend did lose some steam partly due to regulatory challenges, currency volatility, susceptibility to fraud, and low confidence in the currency\u2019s viability over the long term, perhaps thanks to the FTX scandal and collapse.\n\nWith this doubt, the crypto payments market is only forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 17% through 2029.\n\nHowever, since Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, crypto and bitcoin have seen a resurgence of popularity in the United States.\n\n2. Biometrics features\n\nBiometric payments are experiencing a surge in growth, with forecasts to grow at a CAGR of 113.6% from 2024 through 2028, per Juniper Research. Some forecasts even say it will be the norm within the next decade. These payments incorporate biometric technology\u2014usually in the form of fingerprint or facial recognition\u2014to improve both data privacy and transaction convenience.\n\nSecurity is a top concern for businesses, both themselves and their customers. This is especially important when it comes to payments\u2014there\u2019s lots of sensitive information going around, so businesses are always looking for ways to tighten things up from a security perspective. Biometric payments are another layer of security that can help accomplish this.\n\nNot only does biometric authentication help boost security, but it also makes login and connection more efficient. I can\u2019t tell you how many passwords I have to remember\u2014if I can use my fingerprint or my face to authenticate something instead, that\u2019s one less password I have to keep track of. And remember, shoppers love efficiency and convenience.\n\n3. AI to facilitate and fight fraud\n\nFraud is always a threat to businesses and consumers. According to Avidchange\u2019s B2B Payment Security report, more than three-quarters of businesses have experienced payment fraud in the past year alone.\n\nSpeaking of security, AI is another payment trend to watch. And this can work in businesses\u2019 favor or, in a worst-case scenario, fraudsters\u2019 favor. Globalpayments reports that as many as 43% of businesses have plans to employ AI technology to help with fraud detection.\n\nWhile AI is an amazing tool to detect fraudulent transactions and add a layer of security, it also makes the work of a hacker much more accessible.\n\nRather than manually decoding payment information, hackers can tap into AI technology to make it easier to accomplish their tasks. In fact, Deloitte actually predicts that AI could enable losses to fraud of up to $40 billion by 2027. So, it\u2019s important to use payment technology that integrates the latest and most advanced security features.\n\n4. Instant payments\n\nWhile consumers love the convenience of being able to pay with anything other than cash, this has also added to delays when it comes to being able to access said cash.\n\nDigital payments often come with a waiting period\u2014for example, if I make a purchase with my credit card at a store, it might take a day or two for the charge to show up. Likewise, when I transfer money from PayPal or Venmo to my account, I usually have to wait a few days to receive the funds in my bank account.\n\nThese delays don\u2019t gel with our instant gratification society. So, payment technology is adapting to instant payments. For example, if I want to receive my PayPal or Venmo funds right away, I can actually pay a fee for an instant transfer.\n\nInstant payments are actually expected to make up 22% of transactions by 2028, per Capegemini\u2019s World Payments Report 2025. It\u2019s also believed that more instant payment availability will also facilitate more digital payment adoption by both businesses and consumers alike. JPMorgan reports about 80% of finance professionals believe faster payments will positively impact business.\n\nBut time will tell on this one\u2014only about 5% of global banks have advanced business technology, so there\u2019s still work to do.\n\n5. B2B is going digital\n\nB2B payments used to be largely check-based. But checks are quickly becoming antiquated in the payments industry. In fact, 80% of B2B transactions used to be paid by check\u2014that figure is now closer to one-third. And only about 5% of businesses are even prepared to make vendor and supplier payments by check.\n\nYou can see the decline in cash and check in B2B payment trends in the chart below. In 2019, they made up half of all B2B payments. Now, they account for less than one-third. Digital ACH transfers are making the most headway, but card and wire payments also experienced a slight increase."

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Part 1: From the Roots of the Web to Columbia SC Website Design Excellence\n\nWeb design isn\u2019t just about making a website look pretty\u2014though that\u2019s often the initial impression people get when visiting a business online. It\u2019s about weaving a story, engaging visitors, and guiding them through an experience they\u2019ll remember. At Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve spent nearly two decades perfecting this craft, transforming how businesses in Columbia, South Carolina, and beyond connect with their audiences. Let me tell you, when you\u2019ve worked through every trend, from neon-tinted text on black backgrounds in the early 2000s to today\u2019s minimalist, responsive designs, you start to see the web as more than just code and graphics; it becomes an ecosystem of endless possibilities.\n\nThe Evolution of Design: From HTML Tables to Responsive Frameworks\n\nLet\u2019s rewind a little to the early 2000s. Websites back then were like those department store mannequins from the \u201890s\u2014awkwardly posed, overly dressed, and not very functional. Everything was laid out using HTML tables, CSS was still in its infancy, and JavaScript? Well, it was more likely to crash your browser than enhance your experience. In Columbia, SC, website design was no exception. Local businesses were just dipping their toes into the digital pond, and a \u201ccontact us\u201d form was considered cutting-edge.\n\nFast forward to today, and everything has changed. Frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS have turned the design process into something akin to Lego-building. You pick your components, snap them together, and voil\u00e0! But here\u2019s where it gets tricky: while these frameworks make development faster, they also come with their downsides. Bootstrap sites, for instance, can sometimes look overly similar, which is something Web Design Columbia actively avoids. Cookie-cutter designs? Not on our watch.\n\nThe Intersection of Creativity and Technology\n\nA fascinating statistic from a 2023 global survey showed that 38% of website visitors will stop engaging with a site if the layout is unattractive or the content is poorly structured. That\u2019s why Columbia SC website design firms like ours emphasize aesthetics and functionality. Every pixel and line of code has a purpose.\n\nOne of our more unique projects was redesigning a legacy site that had been built on Joomla\u2014an oldie but a goodie in the content management world. The site was functional but far from user-friendly, and the client wanted something that could compete with modern platforms like Shopify or WordPress. After hours of brainstorming, we restructured their database, migrated their content, and built a sleek, responsive design that worked seamlessly on every device. Here\u2019s a fun fact: that site saw a 120% increase in user engagement within six months.\n\nResponsive Design: A Double-edged Sword\n\nResponsive design\u2014where your website automatically adjusts to fit any screen size\u2014is one of the most significant innovations in web design. But, like all technologies, it\u2019s not without its challenges. Take Columbia SC website design as an example: while mobile responsiveness is now a given, optimizing for speed on mobile devices remains a headache for developers worldwide. According to a Google report, 53% of mobile users will leave a site if it takes longer than three seconds to load.\n\nAt Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve tackled this issue by combining the best server configurations with cutting-edge tools like Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights. We even use Cloudflare to reduce load times and improve security. But even with these tools, challenges persist. Older devices, for instance, often struggle with sites that rely heavily on JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. The balance between functionality and speed remains a dance we\u2019re perfecting.\n\nPlatforms of Choice: The Good, The Bad, and the Pricey\n\nWhen discussing Columbia, SC, website design, platforms like WordPress, Wix, and Squarespace must be mentioned. WordPress, which powers over 43% of the web, offers unparalleled flexibility, but its open-source nature can also be a curse. Owning a classic car is like owning a classic car: You can customize it endlessly, but without proper maintenance, it can break down.\n\nWix and Squarespace, on the other hand, cater to those who want a simpler, drag-and-drop solution. They\u2019re fantastic for small businesses just starting out but often lack the scalability needed as they grow. A client in Columbia once came to us frustrated that their Wix site couldn\u2019t handle the traffic spikes during their annual sale. We rebuilt their site on a more robust platform, ensuring it could grow alongside their business.\n\n\n\nThe Role of SEO in Modern Web Design\n\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) isn\u2019t just a buzzword; it\u2019s the lifeline of any website. Columbia SC website design services like ours incorporate SEO strategies right from the planning stage. But here\u2019s a reality check: even the best design can\u2019t mask poorly executed SEO. Google\u2019s algorithms are sophisticated, and they prioritize user experience above all else.\n\nOne of the common complaints we\u2019ve heard globally is about platforms like Shopify and Wix, where SEO capabilities are somewhat limited. While these platforms offer basic SEO features, they often fall short when compared to fully customizable options available on WordPress. That\u2019s why we emphasize starting with a clear SEO strategy, using tools like Semrush and Ahrefs to track performance, and continuously refining it.\n\nPart 2: The Heart of Columbia SC Website Design and What Lies Ahead\n\nColumbia\u2019s Unique Web Design Landscape\n\nColumbia, South Carolina, isn\u2019t just known for its southern charm and vibrant business community; it\u2019s also becoming a hotspot for innovative digital solutions. Web Design Columbia has been at the forefront, leveraging nearly two decades of experience to create designs that resonate with both local and global audiences. While the city might not have the tech reputation of Silicon Valley, it offers something unique\u2014a personal touch that prioritizes relationships over transactions.\n\nThis focus on collaboration sets Columbia, SC, website design apart. One memorable project involved a local nonprofit organization that needed to overhaul its aging Zen-Cart platform completely. We migrated their site to Shopify, ensuring a smooth transition without downtime. Here\u2019s the kicker: the new site\u2019s streamlined design and improved navigation led to a 200% increase in donor contributions within just three months. Success stories like these highlight the power of combining technical expertise with understanding community needs.\n\nWhen Design Meets Development\n\nYou can\u2019t talk about Columbia, SC, website design without diving into the synergy between design and development. Think of it like a duet: the designer sets the tone, and the developer brings the melody to life. But achieving harmony isn\u2019t always easy. Many businesses globally complain about miscommunication between these two roles, which can result in sites that look great but function poorly\u2014or vice versa.\n\nAt Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve found that fostering collaboration between designers and developers is key. We use tools like Figma for wireframing and prototyping, ensuring that everyone\u2014clients included\u2014has a clear vision of the final product. Interestingly, a 2022 survey revealed that 60% of website redesigns fail to meet client expectations due to a lack of proper planning. That\u2019s why we emphasize transparency and iteration, involving clients at every process stage.\n\nThe Downsides of Modern Web Trends\n\nWhile modern web design trends like minimalism and parallax scrolling can be visually stunning, they also have pitfalls. Minimalist designs, for example, often sacrifice functionality for aesthetics. A user might love a site\u2019s clean, open look but get frustrated when basic navigation isn\u2019t intuitive.\n\nAnother trend that divides opinion is parallax scrolling, in which background images move slower than foreground content to create a 3D effect. While this can add depth and dynamism, it can also lead to slower load times and compatibility issues on older devices. Columbia, SC, website design projects must carefully weigh these pros and cons.\n\nOne of our more challenging projects involved incorporating parallax elements into a local restaurant\u2019s website. The result was visually spectacular, but we quickly realized that some older browsers struggled to handle the animations. By optimizing the code and offering a simplified version for less capable devices, we struck a balance that satisfied all users.\n\nGlobal Inspirations, Local Applications\n\nWeb design is a global language, but its application varies by region. In Columbia, South Carolina, businesses value authenticity and practicality\u2014traits that don\u2019t always align with the flashy, experimental designs you might see in tech hubs like New York or San Francisco. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Columbia, SC, website design lacks innovation.\n\nWe often draw inspiration from global trends and adapt them to fit local sensibilities. Take the rise of dark mode, for instance. Platforms like Twitter and Slack initially popularized this feature and has been praised for reducing eye strain and saving device battery life. While dark mode is trendy, we\u2019ve found that it doesn\u2019t always suit every brand\u2019s identity. A local healthcare provider, for example, might benefit more from lighter, more calming color schemes.\n\nThe Future of Columbia SC Website Design\n\nLooking ahead, the future of web design in Columbia\u2014and globally\u2014is shaping up to be exciting and complex. Technologies like AI and machine learning are beginning to influence how websites are built and maintained. Tools like ChatGPT and MidJourney are already assisting with content creation and design ideation, but they\u2019re not without their limitations. AI lacks the nuance of human creativity, so it\u2019s better used as an assistant rather than a replacement.\n\nIn Columbia, businesses are starting to embrace these technologies, but cautiously. Web Design Columbia has experimented with AI-driven analytics tools to predict user behavior and optimize design choices. While these tools provide valuable insights, they\u2019re only as good as the data they\u2019re fed. As the saying goes, garbage in, garbage out.\n\nWhy Experience Matters\n\nIn an industry where trends change faster than you can say \u201cresponsive design,\u201d experience is a critical asset. Columbia, SC, website design firms like ours have weathered countless changes, from the rise of mobile-first strategies to the current emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity.\n\nOne interesting fact: according to a 2023 report, websites built by experienced teams are 50% more likely to meet their performance goals than those built by less seasoned developers. That\u2019s because experience isn\u2019t just about knowing what works; it\u2019s about knowing what doesn\u2019t. At Web Design Columbia, we\u2019ve learned to anticipate challenges and adapt quickly, ensuring every project succeeds.\n\nYour Digital Journey Starts Here\n\nWeb design is more than just a service; it\u2019s a partnership. Whether you\u2019re looking to revamp an outdated site or build something entirely new, the team at Web Design Columbia is here to guide you every step of the way.

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThe small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning.\n\nMs Rassalle explained: \"The purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\" She continued: \u201cThese amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world but they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

The video-sharing giant has added a \"Play something\" button in its Android app, 9to5Google reported. The feature, which is still in the testing stage, plays random videos according to your viewing preferences and habits. This may include both Shorts and normal videos.\n\nUsage\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe \"Play something\" button appears in the lower right corner of the UI on YouTube's Android app. Tapping on it will play a random YouTube Short matching your preferences. However, the next videos triggered by the feature may not be Shorts. The feature is not widely available yet and has only been spotted on the Brazilian version of the app.\n\nFeature evolution\n\nA step toward seamless content discovery\n\nThe current 'Play something' button is an evolved version of a similar feature tested last year. The previous version was embedded into the home screen feed, while the latest iteration seems to be a permanent fixture in the UI. This development indicates YouTube's ongoing efforts to streamline content discovery and consumption for its users, by reducing decision-making friction when opening the app.\n\nAvailability\n\nLimited rollout of the new feature\n\nThe new 'Play something' button has been spotted in version 19.5 of the YouTube Android app. However, it is not yet available for all users running this version, suggesting a limited rollout at this stage. This strategy is in line with YouTube's usual practice of gradually introducing new features to its user base."

I\u2019ve been seeing this girl \u201cAngie\u201d for eight months now. She is everything to me. I fell in love with her right away, and she said she loved me first within the first month.\n\nBut now, I get yelled at for basically everything I say. Like today, I called her for the first time at 2:30 p.m. and she answered the phone saying, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask what she\u2019s up to and she says, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business\u201d and then goes, \u201cI\u2019m done talking now.\u201d This is a typical conversation for us.\n\nAnnie, I never cheated on this girl. I have always treated her well. Is it cheating if I just quit talking to her and start looking for someone else? The crappy part is that I don\u2019t want anyone else. But I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can put up with this. -- Should I Stay or Should I Go\n\nDear Should I Stay: Before you start looking for someone else, you need to tell Angie the relationship is over. Just because she isn\u2019t treating you well doesn\u2019t mean you should stoop to her level.\n\nAs for not wanting anyone else, you\u2019ll never know until you start looking. You\u2019d be amazed at what a clean break and a little bit of time can do.\n\nDear Annie: I will be inheriting a modest sum of money and want to gift some of it to my two married children. I also want to gift some money to my daughter\u2019s two young children to be used for future educational needs. My son and his wife don\u2019t have children and will likely not have any in the future. They lost beautiful twins born prematurely many years ago.\n\nI want to be fair and compassionate with the distribution of money. If I gift the same amount to my two children and a smaller amount to our two grandchildren, do you think my son will feel the distribution is unfair? I realize the inheritance is mine to do with as I please, but I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. We are all kind and level-headed people. -- Grandma in a Quandary\n\nDear Grandma: Your thoughtfulness and consideration for everyone\u2019s emotions show what a caring grandma you are.\n\nGifting the same amount to each child, plus additional funds earmarked for your grandkids' education, is a perfectly fair approach. But because your son and daughter-in-law experienced such a profound loss, it\u2019s wise to consider how this might affect them emotionally. If you want, you could contribute something unique to them as well -- a trip, for example -- to show extra consideration.\n\nSend your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.\n\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM\n\n"

As dense, action-packed, hilarious, profane, meta, and chaotic as \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d may seem, someone developed the script and characters and plots that wound up on the big screen, from the dynamic between Hugh Jackman\u2019s angry Wolverine and Deadpool\u2019s wise-acre joker to jumping into the MCU with star cameos from Marvel movies past.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a cakewalk. In the video above, I sat down with 21 Laps producer Shawn Levy, who also co-wrote and directed, and Ryan Reynolds, who is the star and producer and co-writer (along with frequent \u201cDeadpool\u201d writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, and Zeb Wells). I asked Levy and Reynolds, who collaborated on \u201cFree Guy\u201d and \u201cThe Adam Project,\u201d to explain why \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which landed a Best Comedy Critics Choice Awards nomination and Best Cinematic and Box Office Achievement Golden Globe nod, should also be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay by the Writers Guild and the Oscars.\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis video interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and brevity. See the video above.\n\nAnne Thompson: Many people seem to think that this Marvel action epic, the second-highest grosser of the year, wrote itself. I want you guys to make the case for why this should be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the Oscars. Because it was written.\n\nShawn Levy: There\u2019s this presumption, because the movie has a bouncy, naturalistic flow to it that, \u201cOh, we\u2019re just finding it through improvisation, and we\u2019re trying stuff out on set.\u201d And certainly, there\u2019s a little bit of that, but we refuse to go into production without a script that is honestly 95 percent reflective of the movie that everyone\u2019s seen, and it really was the outgrowth of a long, long writing process.\n\nRyan Reynolds: Many of the alt jokes are written in advance. One thing that\u2019s against it [in the awards space] is that a lot of people consider it a comedy. That\u2019s fair, but it has a backbone that is emotion and warmth. Comedy and drama both subsist on tension. Certainly comedy is designed to set up an expectation and then come 90 degrees to it or subvert it. Somehow, you can do that so much more when you have dramatic stakes. When these two feelings are working in concert with each other, it allows you so much more leeway.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd going into the movie, we felt we had a lot to prove to Marvel and Disney. It\u2019s the first big Fox property, after Disney bought the studio, to be R-rated. We had to write a movie that was a four- quadrant R-rated movie. That\u2019s a hard thing to do. In order to do that, I\u2019m not a big poetry person, but Keats talks about all the stitching and unstitching you do to make it feel like a moment\u2019s thought. And that\u2019s what is.\n\n\u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019 Jay Maidment\n\nIt took a long time to develop this, and the movie almost died?\n\nShawn Levy: It did. There were many moments before Ryan and I even met where there were talks between Ryan and Marvel and there was a desire, maybe, to make it. But once we made \u201cFree Guy,\u201d we made \u201cAdam Project,\u201d he said he would only do another \u201cDeadpool\u201d movie if we did it together. And that kicked off months with Zeb Wells and Wernick and Reese and the five of us as a screenwriting unit trying to come up with a story that is deserving of this estimable mantle, which is this \u201cDeadpool\u201d franchise in this MCU studio of Marvel.\n\nRyan Reynolds: Paul Wernick and I go back to the first \u201cDeadpool \u201cmovie. But past that, 15 years back. And the first movie was recognized by the WGA, and I was gratified by that. We wrote \u201cDeadpool 2.\u201d And Shawn and I had been writing together already on \u201cFree Guy\u201d and we wrote on \u201cAdam.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShawn Levy: We\u2019ve spent seven months trying to come up with the story, because the jokes are the least of our worries.\n\nRyan Reynolds: We just write a drama with the stakes that a drama would have. We\u2019ll work with comedy later, just need that narrative and that backbone to go from that canvas. And it\u2019s counterintuitive, because everyone\u2019s expecting us to find different ways to be subversive in comedy. And that\u2019s later, that\u2019s easier, once we have the emotional side of it, then you do the task of building in the comedy, which is so difficult to do and to get right, especially in the writing, because you have to write and rewrite and rewrite, and then you have to get on set and listen to the movie and see what it\u2019s telling you, because it\u2019s yelling at you. And then I\u2019m in a Deadpool suit. He\u2019s in a parka, in the winter, we got our laptop.\n\n\u2018Deadpool\u2019 \u00a920thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nShawn Levy: This almost didn\u2019t happen, because finding the Venn diagram overlap between a movie that felt authentic to Deadpool, who is an earthbound anti-hero, raw and unvarnished storytelling, pretty gritty. And then you have the MCU, which is often shiny and galactic stakes. And we tried and tried, and we were on the cusp of failure. And I actually intended to tell Marvel and Disney, \u201cYou know what, guys, it\u2019s not happening. Let\u2019s put it to the side. We\u2019ll punt.\u201d\n\nRyan Reynolds: \u201cWe\u2019ll come back to it later.\u201d We had that Zoom that day, and you can\u2019t make this up. Hugh pulled over on the side of the road and called. I\u2019ve known Hugh. We\u2019ve been best buddies for 16, 17 years. I picked it up, and he said, it was like this gut thing: He wanted to come back as Wolverine. Ironically, my first pitch to Kevin Feige five years before was a Deadpool and Wolverine movie, a Rashomon story. So much of these movies are timing. He had just finished \u201cLogan,\u201d and it was a beautiful masterpiece of a movie and a screenplay. He didn\u2019t feel like it was right. And I respected that. But then five years later, it felt like the world is speaking to us in a weird way, right? We should maybe listen.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShawn Levy: The zoom that was intended to be the end of that development moment was the birth of this movie. So instead of saying, \u201cKevin, let\u2019s put it to the side,\u201d we said, \u201cKevin, we got an interesting phone call.\u201d And from that phone call onward, this pairing unlocked the story for us, and it instantly became not only a \u201cMidnight Run,\u201d \u201cPlanes, Trains, and Automobiles\u201d-inspired two-hander road trip, but also a movie about legacy and about two characters haunted with regret, who need each other to find redemption. And that really unlocked the writing process for us.\n\nRyan Reynolds: For me to write Wolverine dialogue was a terrifying process. There\u2019s a specificity to the character. Obviously, he\u2019s very Clint Eastwood, less is more, he\u2019s a non-verbal character. But we\u2019ve also capitalized on Marvel\u2019s pre-existing multiverse format to find a viable way to bring back a Wolverine that is maybe different than the one they knew in \u201cLogan.\u201d Not only that, we brought back what, contextually, is the worst Wolverine\u2014 this guy is a loser. So these are all problems you have to solve over and over again. When the first thing we said to Hugh, \u201cYou\u2019ve got it, you got to be in the yellow suit.\u201d And we have to wait. We can\u2019t just put you in it. They\u2019ll clap when they see it. They\u2019ll love it. But we have to find out why you\u2019re wearing it. There\u2019s got to be a reason. And then the other thing is that the character, traditionally, at least, from the core comic books, is a guy who cannot control his rage. He has a berserker rage. He doesn\u2019t just kill the bad guys. When he goes into that state, he kills good guys too. And that is like a sickness for him. The suit, we wrote it as a hair shirt, or a penance, or this thing that he carries with him out of shame.\n\nShawn Levy: It\u2019s this symbol of his self-loathing and his conviction that he is beyond forgiveness, and the movie is a journey towards him forgiving himself.\n\nRyan Reynolds: And I always thought of it like an unorthodox totem, a visual item for an audience to track. And in that final scene, he\u2019s not wearing it, and you feel like he\u2019s found whatever sense of peace, or at least a piece of peace that he was looking for.\n\nOnce you figured out that the two of them anchor the whole thing, then you could spin off into all this crazy plot.\n\nRyan Reynolds: The thing I\u2019ll never take for granted, particularly when you\u2019re writing with stakes like this, is having an actor like Hugh Jackman, who\u2019s incomparable. I love watching him. We wrote this sequence that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a syllable he changed, in the van where he has a monologue that has more words in it than he had maybe in any entire Wolverine movie in the past.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nShawn Levy: And every writer understands this. I remember the day we wrote that scene, and it was just some days you come to work and you\u2019re like, \u201cOK, no one\u2019s leaving here till we crack this.\u201d And we just did version, version, version, and we spent hours until it somehow felt like Logan, but also expressed a dimension and a voice that we haven\u2019t heard him speak in.\n\nRyan Reynolds: Hugh took that monologue and just devoured it. He chewed it, swallowed it, and delivered for us\u2026and at the end, there\u2019s a stage direction at the bottom that briefly says after he finishes that whole speech, \u201ca flicker of regret crosses his pupil.\u201d And Hugh, in the scene, if you watch it, there is the tiniest little feeling of \u201cI went too far,\u201d and if you blinked, you would have missed it. I get goosebumps even thinking about it, because it was an actor who is so in tune with his instrument and himself. I get to sit there, wearing a mask.\n\nYou\u2019re also surrounding them with many, many Deadpools, many, many Wolverines. And you have all these characters that you\u2019ve brought back, in that incredible sequence in the void, colliding with one another. And to get Channing Tatum and Jennifer Garner and Wesley Snipes, that\u2019s crazy. You introduced that news at Comic-Con in Hall H.\n\nRyan Reynolds: Shawn always comes to the table with: \u201cWhat\u2019s our theme in the movie, what are we trying to do ultimately, can we distill that into a word?\u201d And to us, it became clear that was redemption. And the expectation we\u2019re trying to subvert\u2026is that these two characters are entering the MCU, so they\u2019re going to have to interact with Thor and with all these other guys. But instead of looking forward, we wanted to look back at this bygone era that was important to not just comic book fans, but to us. We cut our teeth at 20th Century Fox, Shawn and myself, Hugh, our crew. We owe our careers to the work that we were given and got to do at that studio, so we wanted to shine a light on that, and in doing so, it led to these other incredible moments, like when Wesley Snipes crosses the frame and enters the movie for the first time. I\u2019ve never felt the power and energy and elation, and even elements of sorrow in a crowd of 6,000 that was just so overwhelming. I was crying. The audience was crying. People were wailing! It\u2019s because they\u2019re seeing someone that they desperately missed, but they didn\u2019t know they missed.\n\nIt\u2019s a rare thing that you kept it a secret.\n\nShawn Levy: But it\u2019s worth it to tie that off. When you join the MCU, you have unlimited availability of characters, Easter egg lore. So for us, we had to enact our own discipline, and that was what supporting characters or cameos would feed into the theme? And if the theme is legacy and redemption, then those are the characters we\u2019re going to.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRyan Reynolds: But also the great thing I learned over and over again, is that constraint is one of the best creative tools you could possibly have. I\u2019m not saying we had what we needed in terms of the budget to make the movie, but it was modest in comparison to a lot of films. And we had a lot to prove as an R-rated film. We had a lot to prove as newcomers into that world. They trusted us, gave us autonomy and some control.\n\n\u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019 Marvel/Disney\n\nShawn Levy: When you have the availability of so much, it does help to enforce rigor and constraint. We didn\u2019t go into this thinking, \u201cWell, let\u2019s throw everything at the wall because we can. Let\u2019s spend all the money because we could.\u201d We didn\u2019t want that. We wanted to tell this story of redemption.\n\nThe movie is dense but while you\u2019re experiencing it, you know exactly what\u2019s going on.\n\nRyan Reynolds: A byproduct of that constraint where necessity becomes the mother of invention, you start thinking asymmetrically. Every piece of real estate in that script became valuable and important. You find ways to replace spectacle with character, which, in this day and age, at least to me, and I feel this as a movie fan, we are inured to spectacle a little bit. When you\u2019re watching \u201cLawrence of Arabia,\u201d there\u2019s like 10,000 horses that are there. And that 10,000 horses in the modern era, you watch that, and you go, \u201cOh, you doubled over and over again.\u201d And so I love that people remember character, and it\u2019s a lesson I learned on \u201cDeadpool 1\u201d right away. It\u2019s just the more they took away in terms of budget, the better the movie got.\n\nHow do you keep the audience\u2019s attention? Sequels dominate the box office.\n\nShawn Levy: You\u2019re talking to guys who made \u201cThe Free Guy,\u201d original film, who made \u201cAdam Project,\u201d original. But with heart, and that\u2019s the kind of movies we love, and it\u2019s the kind of movies we love making. And our hope, and I hope our industry as well, charts a future that includes both streaming and theatrical movies, and includes, yes, sequels, because there\u2019s a certain security to that, but it has to take swings on original filmmaking too. And certainly, we\u2019re not done with that.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRyan Reynolds: But also we live in this age when streaming is incredibly effective in certain ways, some of the best movies I\u2019ve seen are on streaming, but there\u2019s just nothing on earth that will ever compare to the emotional investment an audience makes in going to the movie theater. You know because you\u2019re buying tickets and getting in a car and you\u2019re driving there and you\u2019re sitting down for two hours. You drive home, you talk about the movie, it is that different investment than having the movie come to you, and if that movie, in the first 10 minutes, doesn\u2019t grab you by the throat, you have 50, maybe 60 options for your attention that can go elsewhere. And it\u2019s difficult because you start creating something for an audience that isn\u2019t necessarily a captive audience.\n\nWas there a question of making it \u201cDeadpool vs. Wolverine?\u201d\n\n\u2018Deadpool & Wolverine\u2019 Jay Maidment\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRyan Reynolds: There was, even before Shawn joined. I must have pitched Kevin a dozen, maybe 16, Deadpool movies, a Sundance Deadpool, which was like a road trip with Margo Martindale, shot on no money, no special effects needed, just character. I pitched \u201cDeadpool Is Hunting,\u201d the hunter who shot Bambi\u2019s mom finds him, and they fall in love, become, like, Butch and Sundance and of course, I was told we don\u2019t touch Bambi at Disney, and rightly so. \u201cDeadpool vs. Wolverine\u201d was talked about at first.\n\nShawn Levy: The title was \u201cDeadpool 3\u201d for a long time, then it was going to be \u201cDeadpool and Friend,\u201d and we had a late-in-the-process epiphany that the arc of the screenplay is they are pitted against each other until eventually, and frankly, for audiences, satisfyingly, are joined together. So it\u2019s \u201cversus\u201d that transitions into \u201cand.\u201d\n\nRyan Reynolds: For some reason, we weren\u2019t allowed to use the name Wolverine in the title. I\u2019d have no idea why, some weird loophole thing, but at the last minute, we changed it to \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d and they somehow pushed it through. But a lot of times, it\u2019s persistence. We were told we couldn\u2019t use Blade or Gambit.\n\nShawn Levy: A lot of things started with \u201cno.\u201d Not because they were micromanaging, but because the lawyers down the hall said, \u201cThat\u2019s not part of the deal.\u201d And yeah, we were hopefully respectful hammers. But for sure, we were hammers. If we felt that something was right for this story, if it became a had to have, then we just were a little bit relentless.\n\nSo what\u2019s going to happen with the next \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d?\n\nRyan Reynolds: I can tell you that \u201cDeadpool\u201d works best on scarcity and surprise. So the character is a better supporting player than he is a central figure. And I say that because Deadpool works best when you take everything away from him. And in order to take everything away from him, you have to centralize him, and we\u2019ve done that now. I can\u2019t keep taking everything away from him. I would love to, if we\u2019re in the future, have an idea for an ensemble where it doesn\u2019t necessarily center on Deadpool, but includes Wolverine and some other interesting pair-ups within that. I always think simpler is so much better. Say very little. Very, very clean stakes right at the beginning, not plotty. And then we\u2019re off to \u201cMy Dinner With Andre\u201d mixed with \u201cX-Men.\u201d No, I\u2019m joking.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nShawn Levy: There\u2019s the headline.\n\nYou\u2019re working on \u201cBoy Band\u201d?\n\nShawn Levy: That\u2019s one. It\u2019s \u201cFull Monty\u201d in tone.\n\nRyan Reynolds: Think broad comedy with middle-aged men from a formerly glorious boy band, but it\u2019s a little bit more in that \u201cFull Monty\u201d feel, a \u201cWaking Ned Divine\u201d vibe. And it\u2019s so fun.\n\nWhere are you on writing it?\n\nRyan Reynolds: Second draft.\n\nShawn, are you working on a \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie?\n\nShawn Levy: Because \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d was so fulfilling, I\u2019m quite happily open to whatever\u2019s next. And yes, there\u2019s a \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie that I\u2019m developing, actually with our \u201cAdam Project\u201d screenwriter Jonathan Tropper. You never know what\u2019s going to become undeniable and get made next.\n\nBest of IndieWire\n\nSign up for Indiewire's Newsletter.

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

OpenAI\u2019s latest funding round valued the company at $157 billion.\n\nOpenAI set off the generative A.I. boom in late 2022 with the release of its online chatbot, ChatGPT, which can answer questions in a near humanlike manner. In the months that followed, start-ups and tech giants like Google, Meta and Amazon raced to build similar technologies.\n\nMr. Altman founded OpenAI as a nonprofit in 2015 with several A.I. researchers and entrepreneurs, including Mr. Musk. The aim, Mr. Altman and his co-founders said, was to build A.I. for the benefit of humanity \u2014 not for corporate shareholders."

Although Russia launched a powerful new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile at a Ukrainian weapons facility after the first two volleys of Western long-range missiles, it has since responded to them with its usual mix of drones, missiles and threats."

Evolving workloads could benefit competitors.\n\nCompanies like Groq, Positron, and SambaNova focus on inference to challenge Nvidia's market hold.\n\nIn 2025, the tides may turn for companies hoping to compete with the $3 trillion gorilla in AI computing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia holds an estimated 90% of the market share for AI computing. Still, as the use of AI grows, workloads are expected to change, and this evolution may give companies with competitive hardware an opening.\n\nIn 2024, the majority of AI compute spend shifted to inference, Thomas Sohmers, CEO of chip startup Positron AI, told BI. This will \"continue to grow on what looks like an exponential curve,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn AI, inference is the computation needed to produce the response to a user's query or request. The computing required to teach the model the knowledge needed to answer is called \"training.\" Creating OpenAI's image generation platform Sora, for example, represents training. Each user who instructs it to create an image represents an inference workload.\n\nOpenAI's other models have Sohmers and others excited about the growth in computing needs in 2025.\n\nOpenAI's o1 and o3, Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and a handful of other AI models use more compute-intensive strategies to improve results after training. These strategies are often called inference-time computing, chain-of-thought, chain-of-reasoning, or reasoning models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimply put, if the models think more before they answer, the responses are better. That thinking comes at a cost of time and money.\n\nThe startups vying for some of Nvidia's market share are attempting to optimize one or both.\n\nNvidia already benefits from these innovations, CEO Jensen Huang said on the company's November earnings call. Huang's wannabe competitors are betting that in 2025, new post-training strategies for AI will benefit all purveyors of inference chips.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to three challengers about their hopes and expectations for 2025. Here are their New Year's resolutions.\n\nWhat's one thing within your control that could make 2025 a big year for alternative chips?\n\nMark Heaps is the chief technology evangelist for Nvidia challenger Groq. Groq\n\nMark Heaps, chief technology evangelist, Groq:\n\n\"Execution, execution, execution. Right now, everybody at Groq has decided not to take a holiday break this year. Everyone is executing and building the systems. We are all making sure that we deliver to the opportunity that we've got because that is in our control.\n\nI tell everyone our funnel right now is carbonated and bubbling over. It's unbelievable, the amount of customer interest. We have to build more systems, and we have to stand up those systems so we can serve the demand that we've got. We want to serve all those customers. We want to increase rate limits for everybody.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO, SambaNova Systems:\n\n\"For SambaNova, the most critical factor is executing on the shift from training to inference. The industry is moving rapidly toward real-time applications, and inference workloads are becoming the lion's share of AI demand. Our focus is on ensuring our technology enables enterprises to scale efficiently and sustainably.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nThomas Sohmers, CEO, Positron:\n\n\"My belief is if we can actually deploy enough compute \u2014 which thankfully I think we can from a supply chain perspective \u2014 by deploying significantly more inference-specific compute, we're going to be able to grow the adoption rate of 'chain of thoughts' and other inference-additional compute.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's one thing you're hoping for that's not in your control for 2025?\n\nRodrigo Liang, CEO and cofounder of SambaNova Systems. SambaNova Systems\n\nHeaps:\n\n\"It's about customers recognizing that there are novel advancements against incumbent technologies. There's a lot of folks that have told us, 'We like what you have, but to use the old adage and rephrase it: No one ever got fired for buying from \u2014 insert incumbent.'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we know that it's starting to boil up. People are realizing it's hard for them to get chips from the incumbent, and it's also not as performant as Groq is. So my wish would be that people are willing to take that chance and actually look to some of these new technologies.\"\n\nLiang:\n\n\"If I had a magic wand, I'd address the power challenges around deploying AI. Today, most of the market is stuck using power-hungry hardware that wasn't designed for inference at scale. The result is an unsustainable approach \u2014 economically and environmentally.\n\nAt SambaNova, we've proven there's a better way. Our architecture consumes 10 times less power, making it possible for enterprises to deploy AI systems that meet their goals without blowing past their power budgets or carbon targets. I'd like to see the market move faster toward adopting technologies that prioritize efficiency and sustainability \u2014 because that's how we ensure AI can scale globally without overwhelming the infrastructure that supports it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSohmers:\n\n\"I would like people to actually adopt these chain of thought capabilities at the fastest rate possible. I think that is a huge shift \u2014 from a capabilities perspective. You have 8 billion parameter models surpassing 70 billion parameter models. So I'm trying to do everything I can to make that happen.\"\n\nWhat's your New Year's resolution?\n\nPositron AI executives. From left to right: Edward Kmett, Thomas Sohmers, Adam Huson, and Greg Davis. Positron AI\n\nHeaps:\n\n\"In the last six months, I've gone to a number of hackathons, and I've met developers. It's deeply inspiring. So my New Year's resolution is to try to amplify the signal of the good that people are doing with AI.\"\n\nLiang:\n\n\"Making time for music. Playing guitar is something I've always loved, and I would love to get back into it. Music has this incredible way of clearing the mind and sparking creativity, which I find invaluable as we work to bring SambaNova's AI to new corners of the globe.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSohmers:\n\nI want to do as much to encourage the usage of these new tools to help, you know, my mom. Part of the reason I got into technology was because I wanted to see these tools lift up people to be able to do more with their time \u2014 to learn everything that they want beyond whatever job they're in. I think that bringing the cost down of these things will enable that proliferation.\n\nI also personally want to see and try to use more of these things outside of my just work context because I've been obsessively using the o1 Pro model for the past few weeks, and it's been amazing for my personal work. But when I gave access to my mom what she would do with it was pretty interesting \u2014 those sort of normal, everyday person tasks for these things where it truly is being an assistant.\""

            "date": "The Daily Signal17h",
            "source": "The Daily Signal",
            "article_content": "Apparently believing that the more you repeat a lie the truer it becomes, President Joe Biden recently quoted a Time magazine article claiming that \u201cPresident [Donald] Trump is receiving the strongest economy in modern history.\u201d\n\nThe Time article was little more than a setup designed to position Democrats to take credit for the inevitable Trump economic boom\u2014as I noted just four days before Biden repeated this audacious claim.\n\nExpect similar efforts from the Left as it attempts to rewrite economic history in hopes that our memories are weak enough\u2014and our gullibility strong enough\u2014to overcome economic reality.\n\nIn fact, Biden is handing Trump an economy on the precipice of disaster. Thanks in large part to Biden\u2019s four-year deficit-spending spree, the economy is shackled by an incomprehensibly huge $36 trillion in debt and $1 trillion less in Treasury cash on hand. That debt is growing exponentially, with interest alone now consuming over $1.1 trillion annually.\n\nAnd while Biden has been touting jobs numbers, those estimates keep getting revised down after wildly overoptimistic initial reports. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia just estimated that net job growth in the second quarter of this year was likely negative, meaning employment was falling.\n\nAdd in inflation that is once again accelerating by every measure, and you have some understanding of the debt-ridden, inflationary, dumpster-fire economy Trump is actually inheriting.\n\nSo, what is Biden talking about?\n\nOf course, much of Biden\u2019s speech was laced with false and misleading data woven into generalities about Bidenomics \u201cgrowing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up\u201d (which means absolutely nothing) and the evils of \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d (which exists only in the minds of the economically illiterate).\n\nBiden actually blamed nonexistent trickle-down economics for creating \u201cbigger deficits.\u201d I guess he had to blame something.\n\nBut, seriously, bigger than what?\n\nThere has never been a bigger federal deficit than the one Biden is handing off\u2014other than in times of severe national crises. But we are not facing a severe national crisis. The pandemic is long over and we are not at war. Nonetheless, the federal debt is 121% of our gross national product\u2014the level at which it peaked during World War II!\n\nFor a more recent comparison, our annual federal deficit was just under $1 trillion in 2019 heading into the pandemic. In 2022, following the pandemic, it was about $1.4 trillion. For the most recent fiscal year (which ended Sept. 30), Biden\u2019s runaway-train spending deficit hit a stunning $1.8 trillion, an 80% increase from pre-pandemic levels. Now that\u2019s big.\n\nFor some perspective, at over $1.1 trillion annually, interest alone on our federal debt now exceeds our entire pre-pandemic annual federal deficit.\n\nWhy? A feedback loop of excessive government spending. First, Biden\u2019s reckless spending regime set off inflation (as even the Democrats\u2019 economist emeritus Larry Summers warned it would). That inflation then induced the Fed to raise interest rates.\n\nNow Biden has the economy in a death spiral of higher debt levels and higher interest rates driving each other\u2014and his deficit spending spree continues.\n\nHow quickly are things spiraling out of control? Very quickly!\n\nIn October and November 2023, the federal deficit was $380 billion. For the same months this year, it\u2019s already $624 billion, a shocking 64% increase over last year with no plan in place to constrain it. None.\n\nThis is the actual economy \u201cTrump is receiving.\u201d Rather than the \u201cstrongest economy in modern history,\u201d it\u2019s a house of cards built on federal debt, creating what is one of\u2014if not the\u2014most dangerous economies in modern history.\n\nSo, what is Biden\u2019s proposed solution? Piling the ridiculous atop the absurd, Biden stated that it is his \u201cprofound hope that the new administration will preserve and build on this progress.\u201d He actually said this.\n\nWhy? Well, according to Biden, things are getting better as inflation has declined \u201cto pre-pandemic levels\u201d while \u201cwages have increased.\u201d Of course, as most Americans know, neither statement is true.\n\nIn Trump\u2019s first term, the average year-over-year inflation rate was 1.9%. When Biden took office in January 2021, annual inflation was 1.4%. Following its June 2021 peak at 9%, the inflation rate under Biden never declined to the Fed\u2019s 2% target\u2014let alone \u201cpre-pandemic levels.\u201d\n\nThat rate is currently increasing by literally every measure, with inflation around 3% or higher becoming the new normal.\n\nAs for wages going up, keep in mind that inflation is a tax. So, while the average American\u2019s weekly paycheck was a record high $1,221.42 in November, that paycheck could purchase $176.86 less than nominally smaller average paychecks when Biden took office.\n\nThis is because real weekly wages (the number on your paycheck minus inflation) are down 3% since Biden took the economic reins. That is not what most people consider an increase.\n\nReal wages were up 6.8% under Trump. Now that was an increase.\n\nSo, with crocodile tears, Biden bemoans the possibility that we could \u201cbackslide to an economy that benefited those at the top, while working people and the middle class struggle\u201d to get \u201ca fair share of growth.\u201d\n\nDoes anyone honestly believe that inflation-strapped working- and middle-class Americans are getting a fair share under Bidenomics? The people benefiting in today\u2019s economy are those who own stocks, interest-bearing securities, or real estate.\n\nIn other words, \u201cthose at the top.\u201d That is what Bidenomics produced.\n\nOriginally published by Fox News\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

            "article_content": "If your Windows computer freezes and beeps when moving or using the mouse, the solutions provided in this article will help you. According to reports, this problem usually occurs while playing a game or after closing a game. The only way to fix this problem is to force-shut down the computer.\n\nComputer freezes and beeps when moving or using the mouse\n\nIf your Windows 11/10 computer freezes and beeps when moving or using the mouse, use the following fixes:\n\nPreliminary fixes Check the hardware requirements of the game Check the CPU and GPU temperature Test your RAM Check the issue in the Clean Boot state Update your BIOS and chipset driver Decode the beep Reinstall the mouse and GPU driver Take professional help\n\nLet\u2019s see all these fixes in detail.\n\n1] Preliminary fixes\n\nRestart your GPU driver and see if your computer freezes this time. To do this, press the Win + Ctrl + Shift + B keys.\n\nkeys. Connect your mouse to another USB port or use another mouse and see what happens. If you have a wireless or Bluetooth mouse, connect it to your system and check if the beep occurs.\n\nCorrupt system image files can also be the cause of this problem. Use the built-in System File Checker and DISM tools to repair the corrupted system image files.\n\nThe issue may be with the input power supply. Plug in the power cord to another wall socket and check if the issue occurs.\n\n2] Check the hardware requirements of the game\n\nIf the issue occurs while playing a game on your PC, your system might not have the supported hardware for that game. Check the hardware requirements for that game.\n\n3] Check the CPU and GPU temperature\n\nMonitor your CPU and GPU temperatures. High CPU and GPU temperatures can cause a computer to freeze or crash unexpectedly. You can use the built-in Task Manager to monitor the GPU temperature. Or you can install free software to monitor the GPU and CPU temperature.\n\nIf you have not cleaned your computer for a long time, it is time to clean it. Accumulated dust inside the computer acts as a barrier to airflow and increases the computer\u2019s internal temperature.\n\n4] Test your RAM\n\nA faulty RAM can be the cause of this problem. To confirm this, test your RAM by using the built-in tool, Windows Memory Diagnostic. If you find your RAM faulty, replace it.\n\n5] Check the issue in the Clean Boot state\n\nStart your computer in a Clean Boot state and check if the issue occurs. This will let you know whether the problem is occurring due to a conflicting third-party background application or service. If the issue does not appear in the Clean Boot state, the next step is to identify the culprit application or service. For this, enable some of the startup applications and restart your system. If the issue reappears, one of the applications you enabled is the culprit. You can repeat the same process to identify the culprit third-party service.\n\n6] Update your BIOS and chipset driver\n\nCheck if the latest BIOS update is available for your computer. If yes, download and install the update. You can download the latest BIOS firmware from your computer manufacturer\u2019s official website.\n\nAlso, download the latest version of the chipset driver from your computer manufacturer\u2019s official website and install it. Alternatively, you can use dedicated software, such as AMD Software Adrenalin Edition, to update the chipset driver for computers with AMD chipsets.\n\n7] Decode the beep\n\nYour computer is making a beep sound, which can indicate a hardware fault. Different brands of motherboards have different beep codes. Visit your motherboard manufacturer\u2019s official website and download your computer motherboard\u2019s user manual. You will find the meaning of beep codes there.\n\n8] Reinstall the mouse and GPU driver\n\nTry to reinstall the mouse driver and see if it helps. Use the Device Manager for the same. The following steps will help you with that:\n\nOpen the Device Manager. Expand the Mice and other pointing devices branch. Right-click on your mouse driver and select Uninstall device. Now, restart your PC or scan for hardware changes.\n\nPerform a clean installation of your graphics card driver. Download the latest version of your graphics card driver from your computer manufacturer\u2019s official website. Now, download and install the DDU utility. Boot in Safe Mode and use the DDU tool to completely remove your graphics card driver. Now, run the installer file to reinstall your GPU driver.\n\n9] Take professional help\n\nThere may be a hardware fault with your system. Take professional help to address this issue.\n\nWhy is my PC beeping when I move the mouse?\n\nThere can be many reasons why your PC beeps when you move the mouse. Your mouse or the USB port may be faulty. You can check this by connecting a wireless mouse. The problem may also be with the power supply or another hardware component.\n\nHow to stop a computer from beeping?\n\nA beep code indicates a hardware fault. Every motherboard has different meanings for different beep codes. You can get the meanings of beep codes on the official website of your computer manufacturer or in your motherboard user manual.\n\nRead next: VGA light on motherboard is ON."

            "article_content": "The father of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey has shared hopes that his daughter's killer will finally be revealed 28 years after her tragic death.\n\nIt's been nearly three decades since the body of the six-year-old pageant queen was discovered in her parents' basement in Boulder, Colorado on Boxing Day after being reported missing earlier that morning.\n\nIt's believed that JonBen\u00e9t had been killed in the early hours of the morning, with the child's body showing signs of assault and sexual abuse.\n\nAdvert\n\nAn autopsy would later rule that JonBen\u00e9t had died from a combination of asphyxiation, after being strangled with a garrotte, and blunt force trauma to the head.\n\nDespite the case sending shockwaves across America and countless conspiracy theories doing the rounds on the internet over the years, no one has ever been formally charged with the killing of JonBen\u00e9t. Which means that the exact circumstances around her death have remained a mystery for almost three decades.\n\nHowever, this may all be about to change as John Bennett Ramsey, now 81, has now revealed that DNA evidence could finally solve the mystery.\n\nAdvert\n\nSpeaking about the update in an interview with The US Sun, Ramsey revealed that he is set to speak with chief of Boulder Police Stephen Redfearn in January and is hoping that chief of Boulder Police Stephen Redfearn will involve the FBI on finally cracking the case.\n\n\"We have been asking and praying for this over the past 28 years,\" he explained.\n\n\"We are encouraged that the police will finally use the FBI's skills and resources to help solve our case.\"\n\nJonBen\u00e9t's father is hoping her case will finally be solved (CBS News)\n\nAdvert\n\nDNA found at the scene was previously tested and returned a match for an unidentified male, with the discovery ruling out John, his wife Patsy, and their son Burke as suspects in 2008 after years of speculation.\n\nThe DNA had been recovered from underneath JonBen\u00e9t's fingernails, in her underwear, from the garrotte, and the blanket which had been used to hide her body.\n\nExplaining how advancements in DNA sampling could lead to the breakthrough needed, John added: \"Suppose they now use cutting-edge DNA labs to develop a DNA profile in the proper format for familial genealogy research.\n\n\"In that case, we have pretty good odds of finding the killer's identity.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Ramsey family: Patsy, JonBen\u00e9t, Burke, and John (Netflix)\n\nThe father also spoke about how he hopes Netflix's recent docuseries Cold Case: Who Killed JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey will help keep the case fresh in peoples' minds.\n\n\"The reason I've done these media interviews - Netflix, the documentary - is to keep pressure on the police,\" John said.\n\n\"We're not going to go away, folks.\""

            "article_content": "We need less uproar over everyday drones and more critical attention about ones near airports and other restricted airspace\n\nDecember\u2019s spate of drone sightings seen in New Jersey and spreading nationwide, sure looks familiar. As does its associated media frenzy\u2014culminating in memes and conspiracy theories about so-called \u201cmystery drones.\u201d The episode bears an eerie resemblance to the UFO phenomenon, or the unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) one, that spiked in recent years and has led to significant congressional attention and legislation.\n\nIn a way, this is progress. The reason this outbreak looks so familiar is that such drone sightings would previously have been identified as UAP ones. It\u2019s only after years of concerted efforts in education, and transparency by U.S. Department of Defense officials, that UAP sightings have rightfully evolved into common drone identification. That is not to say that the drone sightings are any less of a concern, but fortunately, we can address them without the contagion of the UFO community and the conspiracies associated with it.\n\nUnfortunately, our response has been no less irrational.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nA New Jersey state assemblyman has accused federal officials of \u201clying to us\u201d about drones on CNN. The president-elect suggested we \u201cshoot them down!!!\u201d which is almost (but only almost, sadly) needless to say, a bad idea. So is wasting resources to investigate nonsensical notions of advanced technology related to Iran or, again, aliens. Calls for shooting objects down not only have obvious safety issues but fail to recall that Congress and the White House limited such strikes over U.S. territory after the incidents involving the Chinese high-altitude balloon and other balloons, based on concerns about civilian safety.\n\nThere are a couple of things we need to make clear about the drone sightings. First, many of the sightings remain mistaken interpretations of manned aircraft or satellites such as Starlink ones. The real drone sightings fall into two classes: those that are in restricted airspace, and those that are in legal airspace. Restricted airspace surrounds airports as well as national security areas such as Air Force and Navy bases. Most sightings reported fall within the latter category and have been assessed as having no immediate national security or flight safety risk, although the public finds them annoying.\n\nOne fact that many people tend to overlook, or at least don\u2019t readily rationalize, is that these drones have lights on them. That lights are present on various flying objects including drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs) is a fact I often referred to in my last job, heading a Pentagon office investigating UAP sightings. Lights on a drone are for collision avoidance. They are a safety feature. Flying drones with lights ensures they can be seen; if they were meant to be unnoticed, the operators would turn off or disable the lights. In September 2023, the FAA changed the rules to allow drones to fly at night this way, and this is likely a contributing factor to the increase in sightings. The public and elected officials in Congress continue to believe lights in the sky are scary, however, particularly when they mistake crewed aircraft for drones.\n\nCongressional officials and that unfortunate source of information, social media, continue to make unfounded claims of drone technologies far ahead of U.S. capabilities. The most recent example being the assertion that drones flew from an Iranian mother ship off the coast of the U.S. and demonstrated seven or eight hours of battery life. That fantastic assertion requires there to be evidence that the drones originated from an Iranian ship and were tracked continuously to the U.S. cities. There are no such tracks. The more rational explanation is that they originated near the place of the sighting, that is from domestic operators.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean some drone operations aren\u2019t ill-intentioned.\n\nSeveral hypotheses (apart from mistaken identity) might explain these drones in legal airspace. They might be academic, professional or hobbyist domestic operators exploring a new technology. YouTube overflows with drone footage from amateur photographers all over the world. Flying in urban settings, in legal airspace, for photography or maybe even some research such as high resolution thermal or pollution measurements is very plausible. Or they are commercial. Increased commercial activity is unavoidable as industry advances drone technology for delivery, remote sensing and communications.\n\nMore concerning, operators could be probing the limits of legal activities, or in military speak, performing or exploring preparation of the battlespace. Whether foreign or domestic bad actors, they could be flying commercial drones, complete with lights, to test reactions of both the public and the government. As long as they are flying within legal airspace, under legal limits, they can push those limits and measure what the reaction is. That information on reactions and response could readily feed back to some sort of attack planning, illegal drug delivery or other malicious intent.\n\nFinally, the operators could be using them intentionally to whip up frenzy, hysteria and panic. It could be for personal gain (such as claiming they have the anti-UAV solution to sell), or perhaps advertising something resembling another History Channel series on aliens.\n\nMuch like the UAP problem, there is little evidence to support, or rule out, any of these hypotheses. Like UAP, the drones don\u2019t likely all have the same explanation. That makes it hard from a national security perspective to distinguish when a sighting is benign versus potentially nefarious. Lest we forget the lessons of the ongoing war on Ukraine, we don\u2019t want to be caught in an intelligence or technical surprise.\n\nMeanwhile, the sightings that are clearly in restricted airspace usually have more obvious intentions. These can range from benign to nefarious, but generally center around seeing things that are normally not allowed. Whether this is military aircraft, commercial airports or operations, these clearly identified drones and balloons with payloads pose not only a security risk but also a flight safety risk. It would only take one small quad copter to get sucked into a commercial jet engine to end in tragedy.\n\nThe proliferation of drone technology, in its commercial, recreational, scientific and military uses, is clearly disrupting the world around us. Our legislation and regulation have created an environment that allows for legal drone usage. It should come as no surprise then that drones are in the air and increasing. Yet here we are, once again with more extraordinary claims, public demands for transparency, baseless accusations of hiding the truth, and congressional calls for more legislation over a mystery in the sky, instead of a rational scientific approach to the investigation. Sound familiar?\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "With the National Deep Tech Startup Policy anticipated to turn operational in 2025, deep-tech companies, especially new-generation firms, are expected to help India strengthen its position as an emerging global player in areas like artificial intelligence (AI), green hydrogen, space tech, biotech, etc. in the coming months and years.\n\nIn a just-released report \"India\u2019s Deep Tech Revolution\", Speciale Invest, a seed-stage venture capital fund specialising in deep technologies and Oister Global, an alternative fund investment entity, have captured the consistent and growing interest in India\u2019s deep tech firms to suggest that 2025 could only prove better. \u201cThe average size of Indian deep tech seed deals has consistently increased in the past eight years\u201d, the report notes adding that in terms of growth percentage, India has seen a 5.3x times growth in the size of seed funding than the global average of 3.6x times during this period.\n\nAccording to the report, a combination of government support, academic partnerships, and private investment is what is shaping India\u2019s deep tech landscape. \u201cThe Indian government has introduced key initiatives like the National Deep Tech Startup Policy and financial support programmes the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council, which are fostering innovation. Premier academic institutions such as the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) play a pivotal role in translating research into commercialised technologies, further accelerating the deep tech revolution. Together, these components are nurturing a new wave of entrepreneurs committed to solving global challenges\u201d, the report said. It also notes that private capital is increasingly recognising the potential of deep tech and there has been a marked rise in seed-stage and early-stage investments, with corporates recognising the value of collaborating with deep tech startups. \u201cCorporate capital has been flowing into the sector, especially in industries such as energy, healthcare, and manufacturing. This influx of investment is positioning India\u2019s deep tech sector to compete globally, leveraging its technological expertise and skilled workforce\u201d, the report said.\n\n\u201cIndia's deep tech sector is at a defining moment. With cutting-edge innovations across fields like space technology, AI, and green hydrogen, India has the potential to not only transform its economy but also become a global leader in science and engineering-driven solutions. As we continue to invest in and support pioneering startups, we witness firsthand the country\u2019s capacity to solve some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges. The future is here, and India is poised to lead the charge\u201d. Vishesh Rajaram, Managing Partner at Speciale Invest said.\n\nIncidentally, the investors\u2019 optimism is shared by CS Murali, Chairman of the Entrepreneurship Cell at the Foundation for Science Innovation and Development (FSID), the single window access to the deep science and deep tech within IISc. \"As we look towards 2025, the deep tech sector in India is on the brink of transformative growth, fuelled by a vibrant ecosystem of innovation and strategic government initiatives including defence. With over 4,000 deep tech startups currently operational and projections to reach 10,000 by 2030, we are witnessing a significant shift towards advanced technologies that address critical global challenges such as climate change, healthcare, and sustainable energy\u201d, Murali says.\n\nAccording to Murali, the anticipated launch of the National Deep Tech Startup Policy will foster collaboration between academia and industry, enhance funding opportunities, and promote research and development. \u201cWe expect to see a surge in AI-driven solutions in many sectors, particularly robotics and biotechnology, which will redefine traditional industries and create new market opportunities\u201d, he says."
