            "article_content": "A new organization, U.F.O. 101, has been formed to attract those interested in local phenomena, UAP, discussions, research and legends. It is set up to be a welcoming and friendly group where folks can share personal observations, post videos/ photos, relate experiences and discuss.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of stories,\u201d said David McWhorter, one of the founders of the group.\n\nHe is hoping the group will be a place where people in the area will want to talk about UFOs and related phenomena without fear of being ridiculed. He believes it will be interesting to see how many have had similar experiences.\n\nThe first meeting of the group was Saturday, Jan 18. Membership has taken off with 171 at the first meeting. Thirty were physically in attendance and 141 attended via Zoom. Ages ranged from teenagers to retirees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been curious,\u201d one man said on Zoom. \u201cAlways interested.\u201d\n\nSadly, those attending via Zoom didn\u2019t get to enjoy the U.F.O. 101 decorated cookies.\n\nStreaming was made possible through library representative Tillie Jamison. Information on the new club is available on the New Carlisle Library Facebook page and website, newcarlislelibrary.org in addition to the club\u2019s own Facebook page at \u201cU.F.O. 101\u201d. There are already more than 120 followers. Email address is ohioufo101@gmail.com\n\nSocial media expert Stacy Frazier from Medway facilitated the Zoom connections and played a video of a local UFO sighting near Lake and Scarff.\n\nDuring a discussion time Irwin and Karen McWhorter encouraged others to share their experiences seeing orbs and triangular shaped objects in New Carlisle, Donnelsville, Crystal Lake, and near WPAFB. There have been quite a few seen over the years.\n\n\u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t a balloon,\u201d one man commented.\n\nGroup members talked about related topics such as Rh negative blood and Bigfoot. A questionnaire was distributed and aimed at helping a person decide if they really had seen a UFO or had related but forgotten experiences in the past.\n\nAccording to David McWhorter, there will be no dues and hopefully a newsletter will be published in the future. He is looking for suggestions of guest speakers and interesting books or websites for research. He manages the Facebook page and is hoping to keep discussions going.\n\nThis group will be meeting every third Saturday at 2 p.m. at the New Carlisle Public Library, 111 E. Lake Ave, New Carlisle. Streaming will be available via the \u201cU.F.O.101\u201d Facebook page."

            "article_content": "AI assistant DeepSeek has rocketed to the top of the iPhone App Store free apps chart \u2013 but if you're one of the many who's downloaded the Chinese app, maybe don't get too attached.\n\nThe chatbot has been lauded for its speed, efficiency and powerful reasoning skills, drawing comparisons to OpenAI's ChatGPT, which DeepSeek knocked off the top of the iPhone chart. Not only that, but it runs on less advanced chips than the top US-based competitors, raising questions about whether Silicon Valley is the leading force in AI it portrays itself as.\n\nWhen it comes to China-based apps and services, the first question that often arises is around user privacy. The viral success of the DeepSeek app indicates that regardless of these concerns, the AI assistant is already on many people's phones across the country. Whether you choose to trust or not trust DeepSeek with your data is totally your choice for now \u2013 but it might not be in the long run.\n\nThat's because the US government is wary of Chinese technology, and could step in to interfere with the app's success in the country. There's precedent for this. You only need to look at what's currently happening with TikTok, and what previously happened to Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei \u2013 you can't buy a Huawei phone in the US (to say nothing of Huawei's networking gear) \u2013 to see that if Washington seriously objects to a product or service with links to China due to national security concerns, it can and will take action.\n\nBack in 2018, Huawei became the second biggest smartphone maker in the world behind Samsung, pushing Apple down into third place. But following restrictions that resulted in Huawei being forced to retreat from selling phones in the US, the company's global market share has continued to decline. Meanwhile, popular social media app TikTok has reached a crunch point in its own battle to stay active in the US, and it currently can't be downloaded on any iPhones or Android phones in the country.\n\nUnlike some chatbot rivals, the fact that DeepSeek is open source provides it with some level of protection. This means that anyone can run it on their computer and developers can tap into the API in a way that would be hard to restrict. But the DeepSeek app is still at risk.\n\nAlong with potential national security concerns, the US government may well view DeepSeek as a threat to the success of homegrown companies, in the same way Huawei was to Apple and TikTok is to US-based social media companies such as Meta. DeepSeek's sudden virality coincides with what many consider to be an AI arms race, which the US hopes to dominate.\n\nThe politics of AI\n\nJust last week, President Trump announced US-based companies OpenAI and Nvidia as key partners in his new AI infrastructure project '\"Stargate\" \u2013 and both companies have seen an immediate knock-on impact of DeepSeek's success on their own businesses. OpenAI's tool ChatGPT has slipped down the app store charts, while Nvidia's stock has taken a tumble.\n\nTrump hasn't publicly reacted to DeepSeek's sudden rise to prominence, but he's historically been bullish about protecting American business interests. The line between what companies supposedly constitute a national security threat and those that pose a competitive threat to US businesses can often look blurred to observers. As such, Chinese companies making waves in the US need to be squeaky clean if they want to avoid becoming the target of government scrutiny.\n\nAlready, questions are being raised around DeepSeek given there seems to be censorship at play when it comes to answering questions about historical Chinese events that the country's Communist government has long sought to suppress. There's a strong chance that a blight such as this on the company's reputation could be used as a reason to restrict access in the US.\n\nFighting the US government on a ban isn't for the weak. Both TikTok and Huawei spent significant time and resources on lobbying in the US in attempts to disprove any reason for concern. DeepSeek will need deep pockets if it ends up in a similar situation. And whether you enjoy using it and find it to be superior to ChatGPT or any other AI assistants won't matter.\n\nPublic support for TikTok in the US is strong, regardless of how the country's political entities view the platform. At CNET, we've been consistently impressed by Huawei's phones over the years, finding the company's devices to be competitive with our favorite iPhones and Samsung Galaxy products. But national security concerns and political decision making about Chinese companies will always hold more sway than the quality of their products.\n\nAll this is to say, if you do play around with DeepSeek, try not to get hooked. History shows us that Chinese technology can come and go from our lives within the blink of an eye, and we shouldn't rely on DeepSeek becoming another mainstay competitor in the AI assistants market \u2013 in the US at least."

            "article_content": "Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek has displaced OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT as the most downloaded app on the Apple App store and the market is panicking. Stocks for major AI connected companies like NVIDIA fell on Monday morning following the news.\n\nDeepSeek released its R1 chatbot at the end of December and it\u2019s only taken the app about a month to claim its spot at the top of the App store. Upon the news that it reached the top, share prices for GPU maker NVIDIA fell 11%, Oracle dropped 8%, and Palantir was down 5% (Cramer effect). Stocks are adjusting to the revelation that China can build AI faster, cheaper, and just as good as America.\n\nThe reason the market is flipping out is because DeepSeek-R1 took two months to build, cost $6 million, and was trained using cheaper and lower-powered NVIDIA H800 GPUs. It\u2019s also open source so anyone can go to a GitHub right now, pull it apart, and tinker with it.\n\nWhen it comes to training AI models, Silicon Valley has always said that bigger and more expensive is better. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman seems to believe he\u2019s building some kind of literal god on earth called AGI and that the construction of this beast would require massive resources. OpenAI\u2019s business models require sacrificing the present to construct a terrifying future in its own image.\n\nOpenAI said it needed to steal the creative output of everyone on the planet to refine its models and that it couldn\u2019t pay them for it. It would need to build vast data centers to process information powered by new nuclear power plants. Meta, Anthropic, and other companies are investing billions to build infrastructure to power AI with the hope of massive returns and a future made easier and simpler for tech billionaires.\n\nSoftbank and OpenAI teamed up with President Trump to announce Stargate, a $500 billion AI initiative. The U.S. passed the CHIPs Act to make sure China didn\u2019t get the most advanced GPUs and wasn\u2019t able to build AI as fast as America. Silicon Valley\u2019s AI lords were set to spend billions to rebuild pieces of the country and, they hoped, change the way America worked.\n\nSix million dollars. Two months. NVIDIA H800 SXM5s. That\u2019s all it took to call into question this dream of the future.\n\n\u201cTo see the DeepSeek new model, it\u2019s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO and OpenAI business partner said at Davos last week. \u201cWe should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.\u201d"

In fact, I considered studying the UFO community for my doctoral research in cultural anthropology.\n\nI eventually fused these two interests in my book \u201cSpooky Archaeology: Myth and the Science of the Past,\u201d which examines why archaeology shows up so much in ideas about the mysterious and weird. Most people are familiar with pop culture characters like Indiana Jones seeking magical artifacts. Perhaps less immediately obvious is just how common archaeological topics are in paranormal and conspiracy culture.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe popularity of paranormal ideas \u2013 from television shows and thousands of podcasts to UFOs on the front page of The New York Times and in government investigations \u2013 made it clear that a course on paranormal culture would be an excellent way for students to get a taste of social science research.\n\nWhat does the course explore?\n\nThe material begins with premodern ideas of magic, myth and metaphysics. The narrative that \u201cWestern\u201d societies tell of the development of the modern world is that the Enlightenment cast off supernatural thinking in favor of science. The historical reality, however, is not so simple.\n\nAs science based on observation of material evidence emerged in the 17th through 19th centuries, so did a paranormal worldview: theories about a nonmaterial or hidden reality beyond the mundane, from monsters to psychic powers. Some of these ideas were tied to older religious notions of the sacred or strange but not divine phenomena. Others were new \u2013 particularly those suggesting the hidden existence of prehistoric extinct creatures or lost cities.\n\nIn either case, the key element was that proponents of these ideas often tried to support their existence with the kind of evidence used in science, though their \u201cproofs\u201d fell short of scientific standards. In other words, the paranormal is in conflict with the knowledge and worldview of modernity but also attempts to use the concepts of modernity to oppose it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe class examines how this tension produced 20th century \u201c-ologies\u201d like parapsychology, which examines evidence for consciousness beyond matter, and cryptozoology, which searches the ends of the Earth for creatures tied to the mythic past. We also learn about UFOlogy, whose proponents have collected alleged contacts with technology and beings from beyond this world ever since the Cold War, as great earthly powers filled the skies with secretive hi-tech aircraft and spaceships.\n\nAs the class concludes, we examine how the \u201c-ologies\u201d declined after the Cold War, alongside the cultural capital of science, whose height of public respect was in the mid-20th century. Since then, proving the existence of paranormal things to institutional scientists has become less important in paranormal communities than promoting them to a broader public.\n\nWhy is this course relevant now?\n\nBeyond public interest in paranormal topics, the paranormal is entwined with sociocultural forces that have dramatically increased the role of conspiracy rhetoric in the United States and elsewhere. At their core, both types of belief claim to have figured out some kind of supposedly hidden knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, the conspiracy theories that are now commonplace in American political discourse are more rooted in paranormal ideas than in previous decades. Conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination or even 9/11 were still largely within the materialist realm. People argued that \u201cthe truth\u201d had been covered up, but their arguments did not rely on metaphysical ideas. Today, major conspiracy theories involve secret cabals, mystical symbols and code words, demonic forces and extraterrestrial entities.\n\nWhat\u2019s a critical lesson from the course?\n\nEvidence must be interrogated on its own, regardless of whether it fits your perspective. I find time and again that students have a hard time approaching evidence without bias, whether that bias is conscious or not: \u201cknowing\u201d that something must be true, or must be absurd.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne person apparently makes a death bed confession of faking a famous Loch Ness Monster photo, pleasing skeptics. Another claims to have seen a Bigfoot at close range, pleasing believers. Without further evidence, both are stories: no more, no less.\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t to draw an equivalence between the bigger concepts. Not all narratives are equally well-founded. But students learn how to collect evidence, rather than simply rely on their gut sense of what is plausible or not.\n\nWhat will the course prepare students to do?\n\nThis course is meant to help students discern useful and reliable information about claims and events, separating them from irrelevant or inaccurate narratives or sources. The goal is not just \u201ccritical thinking\u201d aimed at combating disinformation, though that is part of what they should learn. Students practice evaluating evidence but also develop an approach for analyzing and understanding phenomena behind it: how factors like history, culture and institutions of authority, such as science and government, shape what people trust and what they believe.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

            "article_content": "Steven Soderbergh is back with his first film since 2023\u2019s \u201cMagic Mike\u2019s Last Dance.\u201d His latest offering, \u201cPresence,\u201d is a haunted house thriller that plays with the horror subgenre\u2019s conventions by assuming the point-of-view of its central, unsettled specter. The film continues Soderbergh\u2019s ongoing fascination with playing with conventional form, and it marks one of the few times that the director has stepped foot into full-fledged horror territory.\n\n\u201cPresence\u201d is not the first big-screen ghost story to subvert viewers\u2019 expectations. The genre has, in fact, inspired more than a few unpredictable, jaw-droppingly inventive movies. Here are five you should watch that, like \u201cPresence,\u201d will keep you guessing and anxious to see what happens next.\n\n\u201cThe Others\u201d (Dimension Films)\n\n\u201cThe Others\u201d (2001)\n\n\u201cThe Others\u201d may not be the most well-known film Nicole Kidman has ever starred in, but among those who have seen it, it is beloved. That is for good reason, too. The 2001 psychological horror film from director Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar is an unforgettable head trip overflowing with gothic atmosphere. Set in 1945 Jersey, the movie follows a mother (Kidman) and her two children as they experience unnerving paranormal events at their large, haunted estate.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike many classic ghost movies, \u201cThe Others\u201d is perhaps best known for its climactic twist \u2014 one which recontextualizes the entire film and reveals the countless layers of tragedy lurking beneath its surface. But the film works even when you know its secrets. The moody spell it casts is just as powerful upon subsequent rewatches as it is the first time you sit through it.\n\n\u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d (Buena Vista Pictures Distribution)\n\n\u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d (1999)\n\nIts twist may be as widely known now as Luke Skywalker\u2019s parentage, but \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d nonetheless still holds the title of the most surprising ghost movie that Hollywood has ever produced. Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s 1999 hit about a traumatized child psychologist (Bruce Willis) whose latest patient (Haley Joel Osment) claims to \u201csee dead people\u201d is an immaculately crafted, affecting cinematic piece that has a little bit of everything for everyone.\n\nIts first half, which sticks mostly to the perspective of Willis\u2019 Malcolm Crowe, operates more like a somber adult drama than a horror film. Once \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d pushes viewers into the world of Osment\u2019s young Cole, though, the movie suddenly becomes filled with terror and dread. This shift not only disorients viewers and gives \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d a jolting midpoint reset, but it also paves the way for the film\u2019s moving and immensely satisfying final third, the power and elegance of which Shyamalan has yet to match even 26 years later.\n\n\u201cTalk to Me\u201d (A24)\n\n\u201cTalk to Me\u201d (2022)\n\nDanny and Michael Philippou\u2019s feature directorial debut, \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d is a full-throated supernatural horror film that sets its own rules and follows them all the way to its own, merciless end. Set in contemporary Australia, the A24 thriller follows a group of teenagers who start experimenting with a severed, embalmed hand that allows them to commune with spirits from the other side, but only after inviting them into their bodies. It is a bad idea destined to go wrong.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is a credit to \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d though, that the moment when everything inevitably goes off the rails still hits with the bone-crunching force of a freight train. From that point on, \u201cTalk to Me\u201d begins to spiral further and further into itself \u2014 blurring the line separating life from death until you are left asking not only what is real and what is not, but whether or not death\u2019s embrace is as cold as the saying goes. A lot of modern horror movies have explored the blunt-force power of grief in recent years, but few have evoked its hungry, seemingly unending appetite as well or as viscerally as \u201cTalk to Me.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Ghost Story\u201d (A24)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA Ghost Story\u201d (2017)\n\nMost ghost movies are told from the perspectives of those being haunted. Some, like a few entries on this list, try to make it unclear who is alive and who is dead. Others attempt to capture what being a ghost \u2014 and knowing that you actually are one \u2014 might look and feel like. \u201cPresence\u201d does that, and so does \u201cA Ghost Story.\u201d The latter film, written and directed by \u201cThe Green Knight\u201d filmmaker David Lowery, follows a man (Casey Affleck) who dies suddenly in a car accident, leaving his wife (Rooney Mara) a widow. Rather than telling the story of Mara\u2019s grief-stricken woman, however, \u201cA Ghost Story\u201d sticks with Affleck\u2019s dead persona.\n\nLowery uses a literal white bedsheet with round black eyes cut into it to visualize his protagonist\u2019s spectral state, and he follows him as time passes and the world changes around him. Unlike most ghost movies, which seek to scare and disturb you, \u201cA Ghost Story\u201d offers a more contemplative, introspective viewing experience. By the time it has reached its time-bending conclusion, the film has emerged as a thoughtful, deeply felt rumination on the importance of moving on \u2014 even when we do not feel like we can.\n\n\u201cThe Uninvited\u201d (Paramount Pictures)\n\n\u201cThe Uninvited\u201d (1944)\n\nIt would be a mistake to make a list about must-see ghost movies without including at least one black-and-white entry, and \u201cThe Uninvited\u201d is as inventive and good as any of them. Director Lewis Allen\u2019s underrated horror film follows a British brother and sister (Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey) who buy an abandoned seaside home only to discover that it is haunted by a female ghost, whose spectral sobs understandably unnerve them. Things grow only more complicated when Milland\u2019s Roderick falls in love with Stella (Gail Russell), a local girl who feels strangely drawn to their home, despite it being the site of her mother\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe Uninvited\u201d proceeds to stack its mysteries on top of each other, all while delivering one chilling, ingenious scare after another. The film\u2019s third act is punctuated by twists that surprisingly and movingly delineate the difference between a vengeful spirit and one whose final wishes simply have yet to be fulfilled. The movie is playful, romantic, and, at times, genuinely scary, and it deserves to be more widely known than it is, which may be why Criterion inducted it into its collection years ago.\n\nThe post 5 Twisty Ghost Movies Like \u2018Presence\u2019 You Should Watch appeared first on TheWrap."

Its first products to make waves in the American market are the GPT-4-like DeepSeek-V3 and R1, an advanced \u201creasoning model.\u201d Like ChatGPT, DeepSeek-V3 and R1 quickly answer natural-language prompts.\n\nLike OpenAI\u2019s o1 (formerly known as Strawberry), the reasoning model slows down its prediction capabilities to \u201creason through\u201d its work, which helps it provide more accurate answers. In particular, reasoning models have scored well on benchmarks for math and coding. DeepSeek said DeepSeek-V3 scored higher than GPT-4o on the MMLU and HumanEval tests, two of a battery of evaluations comparing the AI responses.\n\nDeepSeek said one of its models cost $5.6 million to train, a fraction of the money often spent on similar projects in Silicon Valley.\n\nDeepSeek-V3 and R1 can be accessed through the App Store or on a browser. Visitors to the DeepSeek site can select the R1 model for slower answers to more complex questions. When selected, the R1 model creates lengthy answers that explain in a conversational style how it arrived at its conclusions.\n\nAs of Monday morning, the DeepSeek chat site warned service may be disrupted, though the chatbot was functioning normally.\n\nDeepSeek also offers an API.\n\nSEE: OpenAI announced Operator, an AI agent that can take multi\u2013step actions in a web browser, such as choosing flights.\n\nWhat does DeepSeek\u2019s V3 and R1 launch mean for the AI industry?\n\n\u201cWe can fully expect an ecosystem of applications will be built on R1 as well as several global cloud providers offering its models as a consumable API,\u201d said Gartner Distinguished VP Analyst Arun Chandrasekaran in an email to TechRepublic. \u201cDeepseek\u2019s future success is predicated on its ability to continuously innovate (rather than being a one-off success), build a developer ecosystem on its products and overcome cultural barriers, given its country of origin.\u201d\n\nChandrasekaran said DeepSeek\u2019s low cost, efficiency, benchmark results, and open weights make it remarkable.\n\nDeepSeek-V3 was trained on 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs. U.S. manufacturers are not, under export rules established by the Biden administration, permitted to sell high-performance AI training chips to companies based in China.\n\n\u201cThe potential power and low-cost development of DeepSeek is calling into question the hundreds of billions of dollars committed in the U.S,\u201d said Ivan Feinseth, a market analyst at Tigress Financial, according to a note to clients acquired by ABC News.\n\nDeepSeek further differentiates itself by being an open source, research-driven project, while OpenAI increasingly focuses on commercial efforts.\n\n\u201cDeepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.,\u201d Silicon Valley insider and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen posted on X on Friday.\n\nGartner said the global AI semiconductor industry will reach $114,048 in 2025. Gartner predicted the power required for data centers to run newly-added AI servers will reach 500 terawatt-hours by 2027."

            "article_content": "Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek has displaced OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT as the most downloaded app on the Apple App store and the market is panicking. Stocks for major AI connected companies like NVIDIA fell on Monday morning following the news.\n\nDeepSeek released its R1 chatbot at the end of December and it\u2019s only taken the app about a month to claim its spot at the top of the App store. Upon the news that it reached the top, share prices for GPU maker NVIDIA fell 11%, Oracle dropped 8%, and Palantir was down 5% (Cramer effect). Stocks are adjusting to the revelation that China can build AI faster, cheaper, and just as good as America.\n\nThe reason the market is flipping out is because DeepSeek-R1 took two months to build, cost $6 million, and was trained using cheaper and lower-powered NVIDIA H800 GPUs. It\u2019s also open source so anyone can go to a GitHub right now, pull it apart, and tinker with it.\n\nWhen it comes to training AI models, Silicon Valley has always said that bigger and more expensive is better. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman seems to believe he\u2019s building some kind of literal god on earth called AGI and that the construction of this beast would require massive resources. OpenAI\u2019s business models require sacrificing the present to construct a terrifying future in its own image.\n\nOpenAI said it needed to steal the creative output of everyone on the planet to refine its models and that it couldn\u2019t pay them for it. It would need to build vast data centers to process information powered by new nuclear power plants. Meta, Anthropic, and other companies are investing billions to build infrastructure to power AI with the hope of massive returns and a future made easier and simpler for tech billionaires.\n\nSoftbank and OpenAI teamed up with President Trump to announce Stargate, a $500 billion AI initiative. The U.S. passed the CHIPs Act to make sure China didn\u2019t get the most advanced GPUs and wasn\u2019t able to build AI as fast as America. Silicon Valley\u2019s AI lords were set to spend billions to rebuild pieces of the country and, they hoped, change the way America worked.\n\nSix million dollars. Two months. NVIDIA H800 SXM5s. That\u2019s all it took to call into question this dream of the future.\n\n\u201cTo see the DeepSeek new model, it\u2019s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient,\u201d Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO and OpenAI business partner said at Davos last week. \u201cWe should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Be they the industry\u2019s biggest players or the growing cast of upstarts seeking to steal their glory, 2025 promises to be a transformative year for agencies.\n\nSo, to coincide with our Predictions event on thedrum.com, each day this week we are spotlighting agencies that we believe are poised to make a major impact through their work and activities in the months ahead.\n\nThe featured agencies, which we are revealing in a series of articles published each day this week, hail from all corners of the world and represent a diverse range of specialisms. Some are well-established networks, others up-and-coming indies. But what they all have in common is that they have earned The Drum Recommends status based on their achievements in 2024.\n\nSo delve in now as we hear from our first 10 Agencies to Watch about how they are planning to tackle what promises to be one of the most intriguing and potentially disruptive years the marcomms business has ever seen.\n\nOne of the key players in the Stagwell stable, the New York-based \u2018technology-first creative agency\u2019 is positioning itself at the forefront of the marketing AI race.\n\nCode and Theory\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nDan Gardner, co-founder: AI transformation is CX transformation. CX is about to go to a new level as AI will allow a brand to simulate real-time, human-like interactions. Most people see this as chatbots, but it\u2019s more than that. The old constructs of the internet will be reinvented in a meaningful way that offers value to consumers by not only delivering information but also communicating with them on an emotional level. This is where the genuine innovation opportunity lies: combining technology and creativity for superior customer experiences.\n\nCMOs, CIOs and CTOs will finally sit at the same table, not because they want to, but because they have to. AI, data, and customer experience are crashing into each other so violently that no one department can own the process any more. The only way forward is collaboration, and the stakes are too high to ignore. Companies that fail to unite these roles will see competitors blow past them with speed and agility.\n\nPublishers will take the lead with technology. Building a sustainable future for publishers involves focusing on brands as a differentiator, regaining control over distribution (and data) and integrating AI to amplify human ingenuity. This will allow publishers to build genuine ecosystems of trust and deliver the kind of storytelling experience that will resonate, ensuring the industry\u2019s place as a cornerstone of informed societies.\u201d\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nGardner: Building AI accelerators. We made ourselves \u2018Client Zero\u2019 with AI \u2013 because how can clients trust us to transform their businesses if we haven\u2019t mastered it ourselves? We\u2019re deploying 19 AI platforms (so far) \u2013 everything from OpenAI (also a client) to Midjourney and Adobe Firefly (another client).\n\nExpanding our network in terms of skillset and scale. Stagwell strategically decided to align all of its digital transformation agencies under the Code and Theory Network to deliver unparalleled creative and technology capabilities at scale. Together, we\u2019re positioned to deliver comprehensive value for clients from concept to continuity, serving as strategic partners in AI-driven transformation. Last month we added to the network and to our global aspirations by acquiring Create. Group, the leading digital agency based in the UAE. Expect to see our network only grow stronger in the coming months.\n\nFocusing on verticalization. We\u2019re going big on verticalization in 2025. This has a dual effect: it gives our clients confidence knowing their assigned team has deep industry expertise, and it imbues team members with an opportunity to develop a distinct skill set.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nGardner: NBC \u2018Powering the future of data journalism\u2019: With trust in media at an all-time low, NBC partnered with Code and Theory to reimagine its election coverage Big Board, ensuring precision and credibility throughout the most consequential election in a generation (and beyond).\n\nNFL \u2018No Flags, Just Wins\u2019: The NFL dominates American sports \u2013 it accounted for 93 of the 100 most-watched TV broadcasts in all of 2023. But even as the nation\u2019s most-watched sport, the NFL needed to modernize its app to bring the game closer to its die-hard fan base and new fans alike. So the NFL called an audible and called in Code and Theory to transform its app into more than just a game-day companion, but an experience that fuels the rhythm of the game \u2013 every play, day and week, on- and off-season.\n\nYeti \u2018Map The Gaps\u2019: Google has mapped 98% of the world, 100 countries and 10m miles of concrete roads. But naturally, wilderness enthusiasts prefer the paths less paved. For Yeti, this posed an opportunity to take the Hopper M20 (our most versatile cooler yet), map hidden trails across the globe and make the outdoors more accessible to everyone. We built, designed and launched Map The Gaps \u2013 A Yeti campaign to take Google Street View way off the street, showing the world where the Hopper was built to go and inspiring Street View users around the world to explore the paths less paved.\n\nThe 600-strong agency network was acquired by Accenture Song in April 2024 and has continued to go from strength to strength, as recognized in being named Agency of the Year (250+ staff) at The Drum Awards for Agency Business.\n\nUnlimited\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nChris Mellish, group chief executive officer: In 2025, the industry will be shaped by rapid technological advancements, but without a deep understanding of people and channels, tech risks becoming noise. While AI is top of mind, it must be used carefully \u2013 not as a lazy answer to every question, but as a tool to drive efficiencies, deliver better insights, and ultimately create more impactful work for brands.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nMellish: This year is going to be very busy for all the right reasons! Last year, TMW alone won 24 pitches, totaling \u00a37.9m in new revenue, including Suzuki, Oak Furnitureland, People\u2019s Postcode Lottery and Rail Delivery Group. We have a bit of a hot streak going on in the new business front across all our brands \u2013 our research agency, Walnut Unlimited, B2B communications and content marketing agency, Nelson Bostock and healthcare comms agency, Health Unlimited. We are now the go-to CRM agency of record for McDonald\u2019s \u2013 our first with Accenture Song. This is just the beginning of what\u2019s to come.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nMellish: Lots of work to be proud of. From our integrated creative agency TMW\u2019s work for Suzuki Swift \u2018The Best Kept Secret on the Road\u2019 defying category norms against increasingly formulaic car ads, to our Pride in London work launching last year\u2019s festival with a visual style as daring, fearless and authentic as the community themselves.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nNobody knows Kraft Heinz better than its in-house agency, whose string of hit-making work cleverly leveraging the company\u2019s brand equity shows no sign of stopping.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nPlaying it safe isn\u2019t an option any more. This year, it\u2019s all about brands making moves that people can\u2019t stop talking about. \u2018Culture Sparks\u2019 are the way forward \u2013 those unexpected moments that break through the noise and leave an impact.\n\nBrands are also bringing creativity closer to home. The shift to incorporating an in-house model is real, and it\u2019s not just about speed \u2013 it\u2019s about being in sync. When creative teams live the brand\u2019s ambition every day, the work becomes sharper, more agile, and more authentic.\n\nRelevance is the ultimate flex in 2025. It\u2019s not about chasing trends but creating them.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nOur growth is proof that bringing together the power of creativity with direct connection to brand teams and strategy works at The Kitchen North America. In just three years, we\u2019ve gone from four to 19 brands and 35 to 135+ powerhouse creatives across two offices. We now work on 70% of the media plan for 90% of the brands, crafting full 360 campaigns, social-first content and cultural moments that hit different. As the creative agency of record for select brands, we don\u2019t just answer briefs \u2013 we create them. This isn\u2019t just growth; it\u2019s impact, built on trust and bold ideas that keep Kraft Heinz ahead of the curve.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe brought nostalgia back with the Napoleon Dynamite x Ore-Ida campaign, proving that tater-tot-protecting pants do exist. The Oscar Mayer\u2019s Bologna Song became a literal form of payment, and when a viral moment such as Dua Lipa\u2019s Pickle x Diet Coke popped off, we didn\u2019t just watch \u2013 it sparked an idea for Claussen to launch \u2018Just the Brine\u2019 within days.\n\nNow entering its fifth year, Fight or Flight is soaring thanks to its highly creative campaigns for B2B brands. The London-based outfit was the third-placed Independent Agency of the Year at The Drum Awards Grand Finale 2024.\n\nFlight or Fight\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nDavid Woodward, co-founder: As the influence of brand inside B2B organizations rises, one thing we\u2019re seeing is closer alignment between the brand and communications teams. Increasingly, B2B brand campaigns are being driven by earned tactics, and vice versa, comms teams are more frequently being tasked with promoting and explaining brand messages. We\u2019re still seeing more traditional uses of B2B comms (for example, to support product), but in particular, this \u2018culture swap\u2019 of brand and comms is leading to better, more noticeable, more memorable and more emotively arresting work.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWoodward: We see 2025 as a continuation of our aggressive expansion into new markets and new opportunities. In 2024, alongside significant expansion in the UK, Fight or Flight achieved almost 100% growth in North America, driven partly by brand-level engagements for AI companies in sectors such as life sciences and HR. We expect the fast rate to continue as we further diversify our sector offerings into fintech and ESG.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWoodward: We\u2019re particularly proud of our work for St John Ambulance, which wanted to encourage more people and workplaces to take its life-saving CPR training. Our research found that a third of men were too embarrassed to give a woman CPR, with potentially life-threatening consequences.\n\nWe created the world\u2019s first life-saving bra \u2013 The CPR Bra \u2013 which included simple visual prompts on how to perform CPR on a woman. We then persuaded celebrities to wear the bra and help close the CPR gender gap. Our story went pretty much everywhere, including a 13-minute live slot on BBC Breakfast, turning ER into PR.\n\nOur campaign for DrDoctor focused on \u2018the DNA problem.\u2019 DNAs (Did Not Attends) are patients who miss their hospital appointments. In the UK, there are 7 million DNAs every year and they cause huge operational issues for an already stretched NHS. To help Hospital Trusts understand why DNAs happen, we created DoNnA, the world\u2019s first AI patient, trained on data taken from the largest-ever survey of DNA patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHelmed by the bullish Dimi Albers, the Amsterdam-headquartered agency has expanded into a global powerhouse with a presence in 30 offices across Europe, North America and Latin America.\n\nDept\n\nDimi Albers, global CEO: What trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nIn 2025, we\u2019ll finally see AI move from an efficiency and cost-cutting tool to a force to reimagine how businesses operate, make decisions, and interact with consumers. As AI transformation takes center stage \u2013 and swift, strategic, and solutions-oriented applications of AI become a priority \u2013 the organizations that enable their people to transform with AI will distinguish themselves in an emerging sea of sameness.\n\nAlbers: What does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nRebels with a B Corp cause: we are purpose-driven and invested, committed to building lasting client relationships and positively impacting culture, brands, and the world. We\u2019re the first global agency to be B-Corp certified, and we\u2019re currently undergoing recertification \u2013 a first in the industry. This means we\u2019re building the plane as we fly it. While the agency world has been helping other brands sell sustainability (sometimes greenwash) for ages, it\u2019s only been in the past few years that the industry has started to look inward and think about sustainability, ethics, and inclusion practices within our industry. Being a part of the B Corp Community helps us do that \u2013 and especially at our size, has helped us build the muscles around how to do that early.\n\nAlbers: What work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nFor Just Eat Takeaway, a cross-discipline team of 35 creatives, technologists and producers brought fans of Squid Games together on a multisensory campaign spanning above-the-line, experiential, influencers and an AI-powered game.\n\nFor Cosnova, we built Kenna, an AI-enabled virtual assistant that can help customers explore new products and trends. Kenna is available across multiple channels including social, events, and POS.\n\nIn partnership with Coca-Cola, we created \u2018Neon Nights,\u2019 an AI-powered short story about a boy named Max. Using 12 generative tools and with over 600 hours of production, the film was submitted to Runway\u2019s AI Film Festival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPropelled by recently secured private equity investment, the ambitious UK-based social media and influencer agency is now targeting the US market.\n\nCoolr\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nAdam Clyne, chief executive officer: Predictions for 2025? From a social media agency owner? Really?! We\u2019re only three weeks into the year, and already we\u2019ve seen Meta replace fact-checking with community notes, a TikTok ban that lasted all of 12 hours, and Instagram switching up the grid layout\u2026 yet again. And that\u2019s before we even consider the broader macroeconomic and political shifts \u2013 from the Middle East and Ukraine to a new president in the US, and here at home, a government grappling with economic challenges.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest: predicting trends when everything feels in constant flux is no easy task. But if I had to point to one key trend, it\u2019s this: the marketing community will need to embrace the chaos! We\u2019ll need to get comfortable operating in an environment of constant change, navigating uncertainty, and staying agile. Plans will evolve, and both agencies and clients will need to collaborate more closely than ever to adapt to external forces.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nClyne: 2024 was a phenomenal year for Coolr. The agency grew by almost 75% and towards the end of the year we secured investment from Growth Capital Partners, a leading private equity firm, to help scale Coolr to the next level.\n\nWe\u2019ve made significant investments in people and technology to strengthen our strategic capabilities \u2013 from insights and planning to cutting-edge measurement. As we approach a headcount of 150 full-time employees in the UK, we\u2019re focused on creating a robust operational structure to support our growth.\n\nThe big milestone for 2025? Expanding Coolr into the US. We\u2019re actively building a comprehensive plan to take our proposition across the Atlantic. It\u2019s an exciting step, and we\u2019re determined to make Coolr a major player in the US market.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nClyne: 2024 was filled with creative highlights that we\u2019re incredibly proud of. We teamed up with Martine McCutcheon and Lidl to put a fresh spin on Gina G\u2019s classic song, creating \u2018Oh, Ah, Just a Lidl Bit!\u2019 \u2013 a campaign that set social media alight and delivered a standout moment for supermarkets.\n\nFor Deliveroo, we championed local restaurants with the \u2018Local\u2019 campaign, working alongside Top Jaw and nano influencers to celebrate independent food businesses across the UK.\n\nAnd with Bupa, we sparked vital conversations about mental health, particularly focusing on the 58% of men who struggle to open up about these issues. It was work that truly mattered, and we were proud to play a role in starting those important discussions.\n\nThe Omnicom media agency has developed an uncanny knack for working on some of the most talked-about campaigns of recent times, including the acclaimed Barbie movie media blitz and Jaguar\u2019s hotly debated \u2018Copy Nothing\u2019 makeover rollout.\n\nHearts and Science\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nGarrett O\u2019Reilly, chief executive officer: AI will likely feature heavily as it\u2019s already a focal point for lots of people and its transformational impact will continue into 2025. One particular area I think it will start to tangibly impact will be AI-driven search. The growing prevalence and usage of AI assistants on devices will grow and will have profound disruptive effects on consumer behavior and fundamentally change how people find answers to all sorts of questions. Brands will need to optimize sales and their purchase funnels in accordance with that and we\u2019ll have to adapt our services to help clients adjust to (and win in) this new reality.\n\nIf the first few weeks of 2025 are indicative of what\u2019s to come, there will also be uncertainty in policies and platform governance. In the face of this, our industry must remain focussed on responsible marketing \u2013 even if this centers on self-control and self-governance over third-party regulation. This means it\u2019s on us, as an industry, to foreground all aspects of responsible marketing: diversity, equity, inclusion, environmental sustainability, data protection and ethical investment practices.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m optimistic that this shifting landscape will drive greater media diversification as we find new ways to deliver value for clients. Agencies will play a critical role in guiding brands toward more innovative solutions, new partnerships and experimentation.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nO\u2019Reilly: We\u2019re particularly excited to continue leveraging our sponsorship of the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute, ensuring its huge bank of empirical evidence, research and insights benefit both our agency and our clients. This will include evolving our industry-leading Category Entry Points tool, which is driving business growth for an increasing range of clients.\n\nOur Access All Agency initiative will return for a second year \u2013 bigger and better. The program, launched as an educational initiative for rising stars among our media owner partners, aims to deepen their understanding of how agencies operate and thus drive greater collaboration.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nO\u2019Reilly: 2024 was our most successful year to date in terms of industry awards, and that speaks volumes. But what\u2019s particularly pleasing was lots of our work became part of wider culture and in doing so generated disproportionate visibility for our clients\u2019 brands.\n\nA big focus for us was delivering the biggest account transition in the UK for over a decade as we onboarded Allwyn. While this was a great success in operational terms, we\u2019re immensely proud of the work we\u2019ve already delivered for them this year. The highlight of 2024 for me has to be supporting Team GB and ParalympicsGB. Our work drove a double-digit rise in consideration for the brand and every ticket sold contributed to the UK\u2019s haul of 189 medals.\n\nIt was also great to be part of one of the most talked about campaigns of the year. Our work with Jaguar on its Copy Nothing campaign earned the title of YouGov\u2019s \u2018most improved brand\u2019 in December, outperforming all the Christmas ads\u2026. And there\u2019s still the actual car to come.\n\nThe female-led agency has the US in its sights having made its mark with eye-catching brand experiences for the likes of McDonald\u2019s, Netflix and Volvo in its UK home market.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nLouisa O\u2019Connor, managing director: Collective experiences will define 2025 \u2013 people value shared emotions and memories, and brands are seeing the impact this has on their resonance. We\u2019re also seeing the rise of the common influencer, which is reshaping marketing strategies; consumers are becoming the heroes versus paid creators, driven by the demand for authenticity. I think we\u2019ll also see nostalgia remain a key trend, with the focus shifting from retro aesthetics to simplification and a need to go back to basics as the tech world can feel overwhelming.\n\nIn experiential marketing, we see a lot of tech used for tech\u2019s sake. However, brands are moving away from that to focus on the human aspect, tapping into the niche needs of the individual instead of the masses. Consumers crave simplicity and look for brands to alleviate their pain points, which is now influencing how we design experiences. It\u2019s less about what an activation will look like on a camera and more about the emotion that an experience can create.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nO\u2019Connor: This will be our fourth year of trading, and as we expand, we have two main priorities. Firstly, we are focused on growing our content and broadcast team. Working with many social-first brands, we want to push our live streaming, content creation, scriptwriting and show curation capabilities. Secondly, the US is calling. Having activated there a few times already, we believe now is the time to solidify our presence and serve our existing US clients more holistically. Some of the most exciting events in the world are hosted there, so it\u2019s a no-brainer for us to expand our offering and bring our Seen Presents way to the US market.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nO\u2019Connor: It was our second year delivering Netflix\u2019s presence at Cannes Lions, where we brought seven different titles to life in unique and participatory ways. Not only does this project showcase our team\u2019s creativity, but it also blends our strategy, content and production capabilities to deliver something truly spectacular. It\u2019s a huge logistics and production challenge: building six floors above the Croisette, with crane-only access, while the team is completely exposed to the elements.\n\nWe ended 2024 preparing for Live Fest \u2013 one of the biggest events in TikTok\u2019s calendar \u2013 consisting of four live events in six days and logistics for 600 creators from around the world. From hospitality, activations, complex live streaming, red carpet logistics, RFID systems and talent sourcing and booking \u2013 it truly touched every area of our business. It was a mammoth effort and a career highlight for us all.\n\nSuggested newsletters for you Daily Briefing Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

The Drum Insider Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum.\n\nThe serial Ad of the Day and The Drum Awards winner shows no sign of slowing down on its convention-defying advertising for the likes of Bodyform and Curry\u2019s.\n\nAMV BBDO\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nSam Williams, head of strategy: Bringing a human face to big data: \u201cData driven creative\u201d is a phrase that\u2019s dominated the industry for the last decade, but the risk is hyper-targeting without the humanity. It\u2019s time to show that the power of emotion can be applied just as effectively in performance media as in storytelling formats. At AMV we\u2019ve built a proprietary data tool called Kaleidoscope, which allows us to track consumer emotions at scale by time, day of the week and by geography \u2013 giving us an emotional lens which can be overlaid onto demographic data.\n\nLearn from AI, then break the rules: We see AI is a powerful way of quickly getting to creative ground zero. But we have to remember that its output is limited by convention and the data available to it \u2013 this grounds it in uniformity, not bravery. AI can accelerate the beginning of the creative process by showing us the expected, then giving us the confidence to break the rules and do something stand out. Afterall, no AI would have told us the creative way to launch new Sheba Gravy Pouches was by pitting \u201ccatfluencers\u201d against each other in the ultimate Gravy Race.\n\nBeyond inclusivity to accessibility: It\u2019s time to stop seeing accessibility as a creative hindrance and see it as a creative tool we can use to make the experience richer for all. It\u2019s no longer enough to make your cast and production crew inclusive, your output must be accessible too. It\u2019s a belief we\u2019ve pushed on our Curry\u2019s C4 diversity win and an ethos we\u2019re now rolling out across the agency briefing and production process.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nXavier Rees, group CEO: Last year, we rediscovered our best selves \u2013 a powerhouse of strategy and creativity. We were back in the room for some of the industry\u2019s most competitive pitches, securing four major account wins in the last four months of 2024 alone, including Mercedes F1 Team, E.ON Next and Philips Personal Care. And we continued to craft impactful and effective work that real people love for clients, including Guinness\u2019 largest-ever global campaign, more taboo-breaking campaigns for Bodyform, and bold work for Currys, which is really impacting on sales.\n\nIf last year was about setting the stage for success, 2025 is about delivering on that promise. In January, we strengthened our Executive Leadership Team with Jo Arden joining as group chief strategy officer and Jemima Monies as group chief growth officer. The roles further consolidate our focus on driving business transformation and creative excellence across AMV BBDO and Redwood BBDO. Jo and Jemima will work alongside the Leadership Teams of both agencies, including AMV BBDO joint chief creative officers Nick and Nadia. We have new, exciting campaigns coming out for much-loved brands Whiskas, Decathlon, Sheba and Maltesers, and we\u2019re gearing up to launch our Channel 4 Diversity in Advertising Awards-winning work for Currys, in May.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nNadja Lossgott, chief creative officer: Bodyform \u2018Never Just a Period\u2019: the work sees Bodyform widening the conversation around menstruation with another viral punch. Directed by the brilliant Lucy Forbes, \u201cNever Just a Period\u201d humorously brings to life the gap between what girls are taught to expect and the reality of menstrual experiences, and how absurd it is to have been given so little knowledge about their own bodies.\n\nCurrys \u2018Beyond Techspectations \u2013 IRL\u2019: The Drum Ad Of The Day, Currys \u2018Beyond Techspectations\u2019 series ventures into mockumentary territory in AMV BBDO\u2019s film \u201cAmazing Us (IRL)\u201d, showing online shoppers venturing into a real-life Currys store and discovering the joy of shopping in person \u2013 even if they struggle to give up some of their digital habits, such as swiping right and trying to magnify images.\n\nSheba \u2018Gravy Race\u2019: AMV BBDO has enlisted eight celebrity felines with a combined 55 million TikTok and Instagram followers to compete in a bracket-style tournament where they raced each other to lick up Sheba\u2019s new Gravy Indulgence cat food. By breaking with the clich\u00e9s of pet food advertising, the Gravy Race delivered an entertaining piece of content that cut through the sea of sameness.\n\nMercedes F1 \u2018Every Dream Needs a Team\u2019: As the 2024 F1 season came to an end at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on December 8, we helped the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team to pay tribute to Lewis Hamilton in a heartfelt global campaign.\n\nRSPCA \u2018For Every Kind\u2019: The RSPCA unveile its major new brand positioning with AMV BBDO\u2019s film \u2018For Every Kind,\u2019 a rallying cry for every kind of person to be kind in every possible way to every kind of animal.\n\nFounded in 1985, the stalwart agency was snapped up by Havas in early 2024 to spearhead its B2B marketing efforts and looks well-placed to leverage its newfound scale.\n\nLedger Bennett\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nAndrea Glenn, CEO: AI... just kidding. Clients are starting to realize they have a wealth of B2B opportunity in their businesses already, but organizational silos are holding them back from realizing their full B2B potential. Marketing and sales don\u2019t nor can work in siloes, nor customer and product. As such, clients look for more full-service offerings from agencies that both bind creative and media together and have the scale to do it. And they don\u2019t want CRM, ABM, web and so forth operating separately with a single partner each. Instead, they are on the hunt for consultative partners who can bring these functions together to deliver customer lifetime value. We\u2019re excited to see this unleash further opportunity in B2B, a space that remains ripe for growth for many businesses and agencies alike.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nGlenn: We have some exciting plans this year, which would not have been possible without the scale Havas Media Network and Havas Group can offer. When looking at partners who could help us achieve our strategic objectives, global expansion \u2013 including in the markets we already operate \u2013 was key and this year, we are looking to increase our foothold in Ireland and the US particularly, where we will partner with Havas Media Network North America to build a full-service B2B offering to work with B2B and B2C brands. We\u2019re now in a position to provide a full-service offering to clients that straddle both B2B and B2C in North America. Our chief strategy officer will be relocating to New York to lead our North American expansion. In this context, our decision to be acquired by Havas Media Network UK last year and our shared pursuit of customer-centricity has been a brilliant mutual culture fit.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nGlenn: GE Vernova \u2018How to Launch an ABM Campaign in Five Days\u2019: GE Vernova\u2019s marketing team needed to grow its sales pipeline by 4x for its new power orchestration solution \u2013 all within H1. To achieve this audacious goal, we held a kaizen (or continuous improvement) session. This involved taking our client\u2019s people out of their daily responsibilities and bringing them together around a single-minded purpose. In just five days, we identified priority audiences, began mapping accounts, created a value proposition, key messaging, and content strategy, developed a sales process, and launched 1-to-1 and 1-to-few ABM programs. This strategy garnered real results, including a x2 increase in pipeline within 30 days of the kaizen."

            "article_content": "In a milestone for science and technology, the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the DeepMind team for their work on AlphaFold, an artificial intelligence (AI) system that accurately predicts protein structures. By solving one of biology\u2019s most fundamental problems, AlphaFold demonstrated the potential of AI to advance drug discovery.\n\nAt the same time, advances in generative AI and protein modelling are pushing the boundaries of what is possible in drug design, while virtual cell simulations hint at a future where some experiments could be conducted in an entirely digital manner. Yet, for all its potential, the use of AI in drug discovery is not without its challenges.\n\nData scarcity, biological complexity, and regulatory concerns still present significant hurdles to overcome. And while the hype surrounding AI garners steam, it often overshadows the slower, incremental progress required to bring real-world solutions to market.\n\nAccording to a survey by GlobalData, the parent company of Pharmaceutical Technology, AI is considered the most disruptive technology among businesses, including in the healthcare industry. As we look towards 2025 and beyond, the question arises: how close are we to seeing AI\u2019s potential in delivering faster, more affordable, and more precise therapies?\n\nWhere AI is making an impact\n\nSara Choi, biotech investor and partner at the Palo Alto, California-based Wing Venture Capital is very optimistic. \u201cI think there's going to be three times the number of approved drugs in the next ten years, all thanks to these innovations that are happening in the early R&D process,\u201d she says.\n\nChoi says AI adoption is already broad and impactful to the drug development process. \u201cAcross the board, they [C suite executives at major pharma companies] say they are already using AI up and down the entire development stack,\u201d she says. This includes early discovery and target identification uses\u2014areas where AI is particularly strong at analysing large datasets to uncover new biological targets. Beyond that, AI is also helping with protein structure prediction, optimising molecular interactions, and even scaling up production to ensure compounds are commercially viable, said Choi.\n\nAI\u2019s role extends into clinical trials as well, with it already being used to enhance trial design, feasibility and site selection, as well as patient recruitment and retention, data analysis and regulatory submission and review. A clinical trial patient matching tool called TrialSearch AI, which operates on a Large Language Model (LLM), was able to reduce pre-screening checking time for physicians by 90%.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "The Chinese AI lab DeepSeek has rolled out AI models that are a lot cheaper than OpenAI's offerings.\n\nIts emergence spooked tech stocks Monday, with Nvidia down more than 10% premarket.\n\nDeepSeek's open-source models challenge OpenAI's proprietary approach.\n\nThe cost of using AI models has been plunging as competition intensifies \u2014 and Wall Street is spooked about the latest entrant.\n\nHaving a leading AI model is nowhere near as special as it was two years ago. These models are mostly trained on data that's publicly available on the internet, so they're not that much different from one another. Standing out in this crowd and charging premium prices is increasingly difficult.\n\nIn recent weeks, DeepSeek has taken this pricing dynamic to a new level. The Chinese AI lab rolled out models that are as good as, or better than, the best products from OpenAI, the pioneering creator of ChatGPT.\n\nThat's impressive. But what's potentially more disruptive is how cheap DeepSeek's models are.\n\nThat disruption hit the markets Monday. The Dutch chip equipment provider ASML fell 11% after the opening bell, and Nvidia fell more than 10% premarket. In Japan, Advantest, TOWA Shibaura, and Ibiden were all down at the closing bell.\n\nBernstein tech analysts studied DeepSeek's offerings in recent days and found that the Chinese AI lab was massively undercutting OpenAI on price.\n\n\"DeepSeek's pricing blows away anything from the competition, with the company pricing their models anywhere from 20-40x cheaper than equivalent models from OpenAI,\" the analysts wrote in a note to investors on Sunday.\n\nDeepSeek and OpenAI pricing compared. Bernstein Research\n\nThe chart above shows the cost of \" tokens ,\" which have become the raw material of generative AI. Chatbots and AI models break down words and other inputs into these tokens to make them easier to process and understand. One token is about three-quarters of a word.\n\nWhen AI companies are handling prompts and other model inputs and outputs, they often charge users based on a per-token price. DeepSeek's Reasoner model costs $0.55 for every million tokens inputted. OpenAI's o1 model charges $15 for the same number of tokens, according to Bernstein.\n\nThe Bernstein analysts also noted that DeepSeek's models are open-source, meaning they are available free to anyone who wants to work with them. That's a contrast with OpenAI, which keeps its top models proprietary and closed while charging relatively high prices for the products.\n\n\"The whole thing brings up some very interesting questions about the role and viability of proprietary versus open-source efforts that are probably worth doing more work on,\" the Bernstein analysts wrote.\n\nBut they added, \"The resulting Twitterverse panic over the weekend seems overblown.\"\n\nEdison Lee, an equity research analyst at Jefferies, said it was \"difficult to say what the eventual impact will be, but combining our more cautious cyclical view on the chip sector in any case, it may be prudent to reduce exposure to the digital part of the semiconductor supply chain including semicap equipment stocks like ASML.\"\n\nDeepSeek's newly-released flagship model is now No. 1 on Apple's free apps chart \u2014 just ahead of ChatGPT."

The emergence of DeepSeek, which trained its open-source AI model for a fraction of the costs spent by rivals, prompted investors to reconsider the lofty valuations placed on some European and US technology companies. Nvidia, long a market darling, suffered the largest rout in market history.\n\nDutch chip-equipment maker ASML fell as much as 12% after money managers considered whether machine-learning algorithms might not consume as much power as previously projected. That realization, in turn, sent shockwaves among electricity-grid suppliers like Siemens Energy and Sweden\u2019s Munters Group.

Image: Adobe Stock\n\nAgitation in dementia is usually identified by resource-challenging subjective clinical scales and direct patient observation, but clinical applications for data-driven methodology are limited in scope, Bafaloukou and colleagues wrote.\n\nAs such, the researchers sought to examine how real-world factors interact with and influence dementia-related agitation within home settings. They also attempted to apply an interactive, machine-learning monitoring tool to identify the conditions under which agitation is present in affected persons.\n\nThe Minder study, to date, has recruited 127 individuals who were aged 50 years or older, had a clinical diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment, along with either current or prior treatment in a psychiatric unit.\n\nPsychometric and cognitive assessment tools were administered during 3-month visits within the study, while additional weekly behavioral monitoring questionnaires were distributed to participants or partners to track the presence or absence of participants\u2019 behavioral symptoms based on established definitions of agitation.\n\nFor their proof-of-concept venture, the researchers utilized longitudinal data amounting to 32,896 person-days from 63 persons living with dementia collected using in-home monitoring devices over 512 weeks between December 2020 and March 2023. They incorporated a traffic-light stratification system to judge agitation probability and utilized the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework to enhance interpretability. From these data, Bafaloukou and colleagues designed an interactive tool that allows for individualized, non-pharmacological interventions based on living conditions.\n\nThe performance of multiple machine learning models, including Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Adaptive Boosting (ADABoost) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were compared in their ability to identify agitation in the study population over an 8-day period. Among the principal features for identifying agitation were sleep/wake cycles, respiration, temperature regulation and indoor lighting.\n\nAccording to the results, LightGBM recorded the best agitation recognition performance, with a sensitivity of 71.32%\u00b17.38 and specificity of 75.28%\u00b17.38, while incorporating the traffic-light system increased specificity to 90.3%\u00b17.55.\n\nThe researchers further found, via data analysis of their interactive tool, that sleep, light and temperature adjustments were the most feasible in-home interventions for the study group.\n\nDuring weeks when agitation was present, data show, participants\u2019 average awake ratio was higher than in non-agitation weeks, while a similar correlation was found between agitation presence and level of interior illumination; however, this correlation was inverse with respect to respiratory rate, which was lower during non-agitation intervals.\n\n\u201cBy employing an agitation monitoring model in real-world settings, we could enhance the detection of missed agitation instances,\u201d Bafaloukou and colleagues wrote. \u201cUltimately improving patient care and contributing to the development of more precise definitions for agitation episodes."

            "article_content": "A 2,000-year-old tomb guarded by thousands of terracotta soldiers continues to surprise archaeologists after a new major find was discovered at the site in rural China.\n\nKnown as the Terracotta Army, it is one of the most famous discoveries in humanity's history.\n\nWith 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots and 520 horses, the sculptures - made purely out of terracotta - were only found in 1974. Guarding the tomb of China's very first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, they had stood in place since the late 200s BC; making them more than 2,200 years old.\n\nAdvert\n\nQin Shi Huang is one of the most influential people in China's history as the first leader to unite the country after centuries of regional conflict.\n\nFinds in one of the pits at the tomb (China Photos/Getty Images)\n\nNew finding at the Terracotta Army\n\nDespite being found back in 1974, work continues on the site with new finds discovered over the years since.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd now, according to the head of the excavation project, Zhu Sihong, a first-of-its-kind find has been located in the area.\n\nAn area known as Pit 1 is where the biggest find to date has been located, with 3,000 figures in an area 230 metres long and 62 metres wide.\n\nBut it is in Pit 2 - home to war chariots and cavalry - where the newfound has been located.\n\nHere a brand new figure has been located.\n\nAdvert\n\nZhu, speaking to China's state broadcaster CCTV, said: \"Based on its location, we believe this figure was likely the highest-ranking military commander of this unit.\"\n\nTerracotta horses were also uncovered (Tim Graham/Getty Images)\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nThe find is a life-size - and decorated - figure believed to be that of a senior military official.\n\nAdvert\n\nNow, the hope is that it could be a huge point in understanding the Qin dynasty, which only ruled from 221BC to 207BC.\n\nAccording to CCTV, the armour is adorned with detailed patterns, ribbons, and floral knots.\n\nIt is only the tenth of its kind ever to be found in the tomb home to more than 8,000 statues and a size of more than 20 square miles.\n\n\u201cThese adornments on the high-ranking officers indicate how special they are,\u201d Xiuzhen Janice Li, an archaeologist at the University of Oxford, told Live Science.\n\nAdvert\n\nLi, who worked at Emperor Qin Shi Huang\u2019s Mausoleum Site Museum, added: \"The style and colour of the adornments featured the aesthetic taste and social status symbols of the time.\n\n\"The arrangement of the high-ranking officers in the military formation reflected the military strategy, such as [the] commanding system in the Qin dynasty.\"\n\nThe uncovered army (Getty Stock Image)\n\nThe tomb\n\nFound back in 1974, the Terracotta Army and the tomb of Qin Shi Huang were discovered by accident.\n\nThis was after local farmer Yang Zhifa came across fragments of pottery when digging for a well.\n\nOnce uncovered, the tomb came as a genuine surprise with no historical documentation of it ever existing. The entire thing had sat untouched, and unknown, for 2,200 years.\n\nWhile the sculptures mostly look like the terracotta they are made of, they were actually painted at the time to represent the people they portrayed.\n\nTraces still exist but most of the paint didn't last the time, with reports that some of the painted surfaces started to flake and fade as soon as they were excavated.\n\nAs for the tomb of Qin Shi Huang - which is sealed airtight - it remains unopened to this day due to issues regarding preserving what is on the inside. There is also a fear of the tomb being boobytrapped due keep grave robbers out.\n\nAs of now, all archaeological proposals have been rejected by China."

This came after the plane\u2019s landing gear failed to deploy and it ended up bursting into flames.\n\nAdvert\n\nEarlier this month, officials said they had been extracting data from one of the black boxes on the jet while the other was damaged in the crash. It was found that both stopped recording about four minutes before the deadly incident.\n\nA new report said the cause is still not determined (Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images)\n\nAnd investigators have now referenced DNA findings that have been made during an inspection of the aircraft\u2019s remains.\n\nSouth Korea's Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board released a report, stating that feathers and bird blood stains had been found in both of the jet\u2019s engines.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThe samples were sent to specialised organisations for DNA analysis, and a domestic organisation identified them as belonging to Baikal teals,\u201d it explained.\n\nBaikal teals are a species of migrating duck that breeds in eastern Russia and winters in East Asia.\n\nThe report went on to outline how pilots had noticed groups of birds when making their approach at the Korean airport. There were also recordings from security cameras of the plane coming close to birds during an aborted landing attempt.\n\nOfficials added that they would be overseeing the dismantling of engines and examination their contents as well as the analysation of black box and air traffic control data.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe report explained: \u201cThese all-out investigation activities aim to accurately determine the cause of the accident.\u201d\n\nThe plane crashed in December (Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images)\n\nAnd with the black boxes of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder having cut out, it could complicate efforts in doing so.\n\nAnalysts have said that the concrete structure in which the aircraft crashed into should have been built with lighter materials that could break more easily upon impact.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt was announced last week by South Korea\u2019s Transport Ministry that it is being removed.\n\nMuan airport is now set to remain closed until 18 April and the Transport Ministry said the preliminary report has been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization, Thailand, the US and France. It added that the plane was built in the US and its engines in France.\n\nFollowing the crash, Boeing said: \"We are in contact with Jeju Air regarding flight 2216 and stand ready to support them. We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew.\"\n\nJeju Air also added: \"We deeply apologize to all those affected by the incident. We will make every effort to resolve the situation. We sincerely regret the distress caused.\""

            "article_content": "The world of quantum physics is experiencing a second revolution, which will drive an exponential leap in the progress of computing, the internet, telecommunications, cybersecurity and biomedicine. Quantum technologies are attracting more and more students who want to learn about concepts from the subatomic world -- such as quantum entanglement or quantum superposition -- to explore the innovative potential of quantum science. In fact, understanding the non-intuitive nature of quantum technology concepts and recognizing their relevance to technological progress is one of the challenges of 2025, declared the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology by UNESCO.\n\nNow, a team from the Faculty of Physics of the University of Barcelona has designed new experimental equipment that makes it possible for students to familiarize themselves with the more complex concepts of quantum physics. The configuration they present -- versatile, cost-effective and with multiple ways of application in the classroom -- is already operational in the Advanced Quantum Laboratory of the UB's Faculty of Physics and could also be accessible in less specialized centres.\n\nThis innovation is presented in an article in the journal EPJ Quantum Technology, which results from a collaboration between professors Bruno Juli\u00e1, from the Department of Quantum Physics and Astrophysics and the UB Institute of Cosmos Sciences (ICCUB); Mart\u00ed Duocastella, from the Department of Applied Physics and the UB Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (IN2UB), and Jos\u00e9 M. G\u00f3mez, from the Department of Electronic and Biomedical Engineering. It is based on the result of Ra\u00fal Lahoz's master's final project, with the participation of experts Lidia Lozano and Adri\u00e0 Br\u00fa.\n\nStudy of phenomena unique to quantum mechanics Quantum mechanics makes it possible to create so-called entangled systems -- for example, with two particles or two photons -- that behave in a non-intuitive way. In 1964, the physicist John S. Bell experimentally proved that the predictions of quantum mechanics were totally incompatible with a classical description of physics -- a hypothesis that had been advocated by Albert Einstein -- and consolidated the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. In 2022, scientists Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser and Anton Zeilinger were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for pioneering experiments in quantum information on entangled photons and the experimental demonstration of the violation of Bell's inequalities.\n\nQuantum entanglement is today one of the fundamental resources to drive the development of quantum technologies (quantum computers, data encryption, etc.). \"The study of Bell inequalities -- in particular, observing violations of the inequalities -- is fundamental to characterizing quantum entangled systems. It is important to be able to perform these experiments in a teaching laboratory to understand Bell's inequalities, quantum entanglement and the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics,\" says Bruno Juli\u00e1.\n\nMart\u00ed Duocastella explains in the article that they have designed \"new experimental equipment capable of providing students with direct measurements of quantum entanglement.\" \"From our perspective, -- says the researcher -- we believe that allowing students to make these measurements will greatly facilitate their understanding of this unintuitive phenomenon.\"\n\nIntroducing students to advanced tools The system designed by the UB team makes it possible to study Bell inequalities and also to perform full two-photon state tomography. With a simple operation, it can prepare different quantum entangled states. Compared to previous proposals, \"the new equipment has improved the photon-capture process: it uses detectors assembled to optical fibres, one of the key innovations to simplify the experiment, which facilitates the alignment of the system and increases the efficiency of the detection. Thus, a complete measurement of the Bell inequalities can be performed during a practical laboratory session (between one and two hours),\" say Juli\u00e1 and Duocastella.\n\nThe results reveal successful manipulation of the quantum state of photons and the achievement of high-fidelity entangled states and significant violations of Bell inequalities. Also, the elements of the system are widely used in current quantum technologies, facilitating students' contact with advanced instrumentation.\n\nThis innovation, which has already been applied in bachelor's and master's degree courses, has received very positive feedback from all students. In the bachelor's degree in Physics, it allows experimental demonstrations to be carried out to complement the subject of Classical and Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Mechanics. In the master's degree course, it is one of the four experiments in the Advanced Quantum Laboratory of the Master's degree in Quantum Science and Technologies.\n\nThis study has received funding from both the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities and the European Union's Next Generation EU funds."
