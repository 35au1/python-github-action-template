        "article_content": "Watch live! 2nd UFO hearing held by US congress, witnesses include fmr. miltary - YouTube Watch On\n\nThe U.S. government is holding another hearing on UFOs this week, and you can watch it live.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representative's Committee on Oversight and Accountability will administer the hearing, titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\" The name of the event refers to UFOs by their new preferred acronym, which is more inclusive of sightings that might take place not only in the air but also in space, as well as those that take place across multiple domains.\n\nThe hearing will be held at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington D.C. at 11:30 a.m. ET (1630 GMT) on Wednesday (Nov. 13). You'll be able to watch it live here on Space.com, courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.\n\nThis marks the second congressional hearing U.S. Congress has put together in order to \"further pull back the curtain on secret UAP research programs conducted by the U.S. government, and undisclosed findings they have yielded,\" according to a House statement. The hearing will examine the U.S. Department of Defense's strict classification policies when it comes to UAP and related topics, and will explore ways to \"make sure the American public is better informed on this topic.\"\n\nThis will be a joint hearing, led by representatives Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) and Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), who argue that \"the American people are tired of the obfuscation and refusal to release information by the federal government,\" according to the House's statement.\n\n\"Americans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose. We can only ensure that understanding by providing consistent, systemic transparency. We look forward to hearing from expert witnesses on ways to shed more light and bring greater accountability to this issue,\" Mace and Grothman said in the statement.\n\nExpert witnesses in the hearing will include Luis Elizondo, a decorated former counterintelligence officer who has claimed for years that the U.S. government is hiding knowledge of UAP, including materials recovered from crashed flying saucers.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"The cover-up and disinformation campaign has been so successful that most scientists do not even know UAP are real,\" Elizondo wrote in his 2024 book \"Imminent.\" The book also claims that four \"deceased nonhuman bodies\" were recovered from the infamous 1947 crash in Roswell, New Mexico and that \"China and Russia do not have the same stigma and can employ their scientists to work on this topic for them.\"\n\nElizondo has also claimed firsthand knowledge of U.S. programs that employ individuals with psychic powers to \"remote view\" distant locations. Most recently, the former counterintelligence officer held a paid event where a photo was shown that Elizondo claimed was a \"real photo\" of a \"mothership\" UFO above a U.S. embassy. Within days, the photo was found to be the reflection of a lamp in a window.\n\nThe House hearing will also include Tim Gallaudet, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who unidentified submersible objects, arguing that \"these underwater anomalies jeopardize US maritime security.\" Gallaudet has also told interviewers that his daughter is a \"medium\" who can communicate with spirits.\n\nOther speakers at the hearing include journalist Michael Shellenberger, who has also claimed the U.S. government is hiding UFO crash retrieval programs, and former NASA Associate Administrator of Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold, who is a member of NASA's independent UAP study team.\n\nAccording to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson's remarks in September 2024 when the team's report was released, \"the top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn.\"\n\n\"The NASA independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin, but we don't know what these UAP are,\" Nelson said."

        "article_content": "Netflix\u2019s \u2018Investigation Alien\u2019 delves into worldwide accounts of alleged UFO sightings and extraterrestrial encounters. Among these is a report from Council Bluffs, Iowa, dating back to December 1997. Locals claimed mysterious metal had fallen from the sky, with many suspecting it came from another world. However, Darrell Livengood offers a different perspective. He makes the argument that these claims are a hoax and presents a credible, logical explanation for what others believe to be genuine.\n\nDarrell Livengood Claimed He Could Explain the 1977 Sighting in Iowa\n\nIn December 1977, residents of Council Bluffs, Iowa, reported mysterious metal objects falling from the sky, sparking intrigue and speculation. Many witnesses described seeing a lava-like substance that solidified rapidly, embedded with blue shards. Resident Mike Moore explained that the blue fragments resembled glass from a 1950s-1960s camera but noted they didn\u2019t melt with the rest of the material. However, another resident, Darrell Livengood, shared a different perspective, recalling how he\u2019d returned from college for the holidays and gone out with three friends on December 17, 1977. Two of these worked for Union Pacific, and together, they decided to engage in some playful mischief.\n\nDarrell recounted that his friends had two tools they called \u201cchargers,\u201d which were actually similar to thermal welding devices. They decided to ignite them, and the resulting flame shot about 30 feet into the air, forming a smoke cloud that might have resembled a floating disc to onlookers. He added that the upward flame could have appeared to some as if it were moving downward. At the time, when people were collecting residue from the site, he and his friends remained silent, but over the years, he felt compelled to debunk the claims.\n\nDarrell insisted that the residue found at the site was nothing more than phosphorus and powder, supporting his claim that there was no mysterious or otherworldly explanation. Yet, when UFO journalist George Knapp took samples of the material for testing, an explosives chemist reported that the composition didn\u2019t match Darrell\u2019s account. According to the chemist, the substance couldn\u2019t have come from a thermal welding tool, as Darrell suggested. Despite the test results, Darrell remains firm in his version of events, convinced that nothing unusual occurred that day and that the incident was simply a misunderstanding rather than a supernatural encounter.\n\nDarrell Livengood is Leading a Fulfilling Life With His Wife Today\n\nDarrell Livengood is now happily settled in Surprise, Arizona, where he has crafted a fulfilling life surrounded by music, love, and a deep sense of gratitude. Darrell graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School and later pursued higher education at the University of Iowa. After finishing college, Darrell embarked on a steady, dedicated career as a rural letter carrier for the USPS, a position he held for many years. His job took him across rural landscapes, connecting him to countless communities. When he eventually retired from the USPS, he was not quite ready to slow down. Seeking a new challenge, Darrell decided to take up work operating forklifts, finding fulfillment in staying active and continuing to work with his hands. He remained in this role for some time, easing into retirement at his own pace.\n\nDarrell\u2019s journey brought him back together with Marlo Keifer, the love of his life. After living together for ten years, they parted ways, and each went on a separate path. Nineteen years later, they reconnected, rekindled their love, and got married on February 18, 2014. Marlo brought two daughters into their relationship, adding to the joy in their life together, and the couple now enjoys a peaceful, contented life. Though Darrell is retired, his passion for music remains unwavering. In 2014, he proudly released his first album, \u2018Erie Canal,\u2019 a collection that reflects his lifelong love for storytelling through song. Today, Darrell and Marlo savor the simple pleasures\u2014Darrell, with his guitar in hand, is grateful for the family, friends, and moments that have shaped his journey.\n\nRead More: Donald Schmitt: Where is the UFOlogist Now?"

But whatever they\u2019re called, there\u2019s no doubt that people have been seeing things in the sky that defy explanation for as long as recorded history. Sightings spiked in the 1950s and 60s, though, which just happened to be the same era the United States and other countries started testing some very unconventional aircraft. But if this explains some sightings, what does that tell us about what kinds of next-gen technology the military might be developing today?\n\n24/7 Wall St. Insights\n\nSome UFO reports over the past 70 years could be explained by people witnessing test flights of advanced U.S. military technology.\n\nThe capabilities of recent UAPs describe startling technology far beyond anything we\u2019ve seen so far. Could this indicate the U.S. or other countries are making exponential leaps in military technology?\n\nAlso: Discover \u201cThe Next NVIDIA\n\nFamous UAP Sightings:\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nBattle of Los Angeles (1942): Anti-aircraft guns fired over 1,400 shells at an unidentified object approaching the city that was initially thought to be a Japanese attack.\n\nAnti-aircraft guns fired over 1,400 shells at an unidentified object approaching the city that was initially thought to be a Japanese attack.

U.S. Navy Videos (2020): the Navy released videos of incidents in 2004 and 2015 in which pilots observed unidentified objects moving at extraordinary velocities and against strong winds with no resistance.\n\nOrdinary Explanations For UAPs\n\nAtosan / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile the attention of the general public tends to jump quickly to the conclusion that we are being visited by aliens, most UAPs can be explained in more prosaic ways:\n\nUnusual weather phenomena, such as ball lighting, earthquake lights, or city lights reflecting off of lenticular clouds.\n\nInstrument artifacts such as reflections, calibration problems, or mechanical defects that create an illusion of a real object.\n\nCivilian or military aircraft, including weather balloons, drones, flares released by aircraft in training exercises, or foreign military surveillance such as the infamous Chinese spy balloon that traversed the country before being shot down off the coast of Myrtle Beach, SC.\n\nMass hysteria or other psychological factors in some of the people who allege sightings.\n\nDeliberate hoaxes as simple as teenage pranks or as calculating as efforts to promote or discredit popular beliefs or make money from videos and photos of a UAP sighting.\n\nWhen & Where Have UAPs Been Reported?\n\nNew Africa / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile UAPs have been reported all over the world, by far most have been reported in the United States since the 1950s. They\u2019ve often been reported around military bases, nuclear missile sites, and naval assets. All of this is what might be expected if some of the sightings reported were tests of advanced aircraft.\n\nThe Extraterrestrial Hypothesis\n\nPeopleImages.com - Yuri A / Shutterstock.com\n\nPopular media has so driven home the idea that UAPs are visitors from other worlds and that the government is covering up contact with them that it is difficult for true believers to consider other more likely explanations. At the same time it is true that in some cases, the prosaic explanations can be ruled out and there are credible professional witnesses, such as US military personnel, backed up by instrumentation that has recorded the objects.\n\nThe idea that these are spaceships flown by \u201clittle green men\u201d makes UAP reports the butt of jokes, but also real questions about how and why alien civilizations would travel so far (and apparently crash so often!) Proponents of the extraterrestrial hypothesis have suggested these beings might not come from another place, but this place in another dimension or time. The idea is that there could be civilizations at higher spacial dimensions that are parallel with our space but invisible to us. Or these could be highly evolved human beings from the very remote future (say, 100,000 years CE) who have learned to time-travel and are studying their past (us).\n\nDoes the Government Have Crashed UAPs?\n\nImageBank4u / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn July 2023, a former U.S. military intelligence officer named David Grusch testified before Congress that the United States has in its possession multiple crashed spacecraft and the remains of \u201cnon-human biologics.\u201d He alleged that the government has been working for decades to reverse-engineer technology recovered from these craft and urged Congressional investigation into these allegations and greater transparency in the government.\n\nIs it a Government Psyops Effort?\n\nBerit Kessler / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust because a former government employee alleges something doesn\u2019t make it true, however. It is possible the United States benefits from the extraterrestrial hypothesis as a form of psychological warfare against its enemies. As Grusch testified, the US was still reeling from Covid-19 and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was ongoing. There was considerable speculation about the possibility of Putin using tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Releasing this type of information at that time might have served a dual purpose of distracting the American people from the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic and making our enemies uncertain about what kind of secret futuristic tech we might break out against them if they go too far.\n\nExtraordinary UAP Abilities\n\nRaggedstone / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf all the different types of features reported in UAP sightings, these are some of the most common. If any of the sightings that showed these capabilities are tests of new military technology, it would indicate breakthroughs that are far more advanced than anyone could have imagined.\n\nHovering or flying without wings or rotors.\n\nUnusual shapes like spheres, triangles, or disks.\n\nHypersonic speeds without causing sonic booms or vapor trails.\n\nExtreme maneuverability: able to stop or sharply change direction instantaneously.\n\nNo visible or audible means of propulsion.\n\nDifficult to observe, photograph, or track clearly and consistently.\n\nAble to move between space, the atmosphere, and water without a perceptible change in performance.\n\nNext up, some examples of military aviation technology that might easily have been mistaken for UAPs.\n\n1. The V-173/XF5U-1 \u201cFlying Pancake\u201d (1942)\n\nHoward Levy via Williams T. Larkins / Wikimedia Commons\n\nThese light, maneuverable fighters didn\u2019t require long runways, so they were ideal for aircraft carriers. They had an unusual disc-shaped wing structure. A prototype was tested in 1942 and an improved version in 1945, but it was cancelled in 1947 in favor of jet-powered aircraft.\n\n2. Project Mogul (1947-1949)\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nThis was a surveillance program that started in 1947 using high altitude balloons to monitor acoustic waves from Soviet nuclear tests. According to the U.S. government, a crash of one of the Mogul systems was the source of the Roswell crash debris.\n\n3. U-2 Dragon Lady (1954)\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\n4. The VZ-9AV Avrocar (1958)\n\nThe U-2 was a high-altitude spy plane that flew at 70,000 feet, out of the range of anti-aircraft guns in the 1950s. Its unconventional design, altitude, and speed may have contributed to some UFO reports of that era.\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nThe Avrocar was a flying disk funded by the U.S. Army and Air Force and developed in Canada in the 1950s and 60s. It was intended as a multipurpose military craft with vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. It was powered by three turbojet engines that allowed it to hover over difficult terrain. It was cancelled in the 1960s due to performance issues like instability, severe vibration, and an inability to hover for more than just a short time. Anyone catching a glimpse of this literal flying saucer could be forgiven for reporting they had seen a literal flying saucer!\n\n5. Oxcart/A-12/SR-71 (1958)\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\n6. F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter (1975)\n\nUnofficially called the \u201cBlackbird,\u201d this long-ranged advanced reconnaissance aircraft flew from 1966-1998. Its unusual shape and capabilities and the high-altitude vapor trails it left were unknown to people in the early years it was being tested.\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nThe US Air Force F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter has an innovative shape and stealth radar-evading capabilities that made it not just impressive, but frightening to anyone who might have caught an unexpected glimpse of one as it was being tested in the 1980s.\n\n7. B-2 Spirit Bomber (1980)\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nThe B-2 Spirit stealth bomber has a futuristic \u201cflying wing\u201d design and a dark color that conceals its shape against the night sky. Seen during the day, it looks startlingly alien, as if it should not even be able to fly. It\u2019s easy to see how it would inspire some UAP reports by citizens.\n\n8. UAVs (drones) (1980s-present)\n\n5. RQ-170 Sentinel\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nUAVs, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, are more commonly known as drones. Developed and tested starting in the 1980s, drones were designed for surveillance and reconnaissance, stealth, and remote strike capabilities. Drones are becoming quite common and are currently being used extensively in the Russia-Ukraine war. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and new experimental ones are being devised all the time. This makes them a frequent object of UAP reports.\n\n9. B-21 Raider (2015)\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nThe B-21 Raider is a new aircraft still in the development phase. It is a 6th-generation long-range strike bomber designed to evade radar and penetrate enemy anti-aircraft defenses to deliver conventional or nuclear payloads. Seen edge-on, its design resembles a combination of a saucer and a flying wing. It will be a replacement for the Air Force\u2019s current fleet of B-2 Spirit bombers. This video provides more details and demonstrates the plane in flight.\n\nFascinating Either Way\n\nGorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf course, if UAPs are travelers from another planet, dimension, or time, that\u2019s both extraordinarily exciting and disturbing. But they are interesting no matter what their explanation. Mass hysteria, strange weather, or unknown physical principles? Nice! Let\u2019s figure that out. But if they turn out to be advanced aviation tests, they suggest the world may be on the verge of seeing technology that up until now we\u2019ve seen only in science fiction!\n\nWant to Retire Early?

        "article_content": "Gemini is Google\u2019s most important product right now, with Google baking its genAI chatbot into as many products as it can. The Pixel 9 served as the key piece of hardware to showcase several new Gemini capabilities, including Gemini Live functionality. That\u2019s the equivalent of OpenAI\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode for ChatGPT, which makes the AI sound like a real human.\n\nBut Google isn\u2019t happy rolling out Gemini to as many Android devices as possible. It\u2019s also targeting the iPhone, a potentially lucrative market for Google when it comes to its AI ambitions.\n\nRumors already say that Apple will soon offer chatbot choices to iPhone users by integrating Google Gemini into Apple Intelligence alongside ChatGPT. The latter will get a period of exclusivity since it\u2019s Apple\u2019s preferred partner for the launch of Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhether or not Gemini comes to Apple Intelligence, Google is testing another way to make Gemini available to iPhone users. The company rolled out a standalone Google Gemini app in some test markets, complete with Gemini Live functionality.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nAn iPhone user posted screenshots on Reddit that prove the Google Gemini app for iPhone is legitimate. According to 9to5Google, the app is available in the Philippines, but you can\u2019t download it from the App Store in the US. I could not find a version of the app in the EU, but then again, the European block is never among the first regions to receive any new AI app.\n\nApp Store listing for the Google Gemini app. Image source: Reddit\n\nThe advantage of having a standalone Gemini app for iPhone is that you can talk to the chatbot directly without going through the iPhone\u2019s Google app. That\u2019s currenty the only way to access Google Gemini on iPhone without loading the chatbot in a browser. Gemini Live is not available in the Google app.\n\nHaving Gemini Live baked into a standalone Gemini app is even better. I got access to Advanced Voice Mode recently inside the ChatGPT app for iPhone, and it was an interesting experience. The smartphone is probably the place to talk to AI via voice rather than text prompts.\n\nGoogle Gemini app installed on an iPhone. Image source: Reddit\n\nGoogle will take advantage of the iPhone\u2019s Live Activity feature to let you talk to Gemini Live even when the screen is off or when you\u2019re using the iPhone for something else. ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode works similarly on the iPhone.\n\nAlso, if Gemini comes to Apple Intelligence, it won\u2019t be available on most current iPhones. Only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 series support Apple Intelligence. A standalone Google Gemini app would help fix that potential problem.\n\nGemini Live functionality in the Google Gemini app for iPhone.

While the company already offers a Gemini app on Android, iPhone users can only access the AI feature within the main Google app. The standalone app is expected to include additional features not available in the integrated Google app.\n\nAccording to 9to5Google, at least one Reddit user claims to have downloaded the Gemini app from the App Store. Once installed, the app places an icon on the home screen, allowing users to summon the AI assistant with a tap. It also offers a customizable shortcut for quick access. The App Store listing promotes the app as a way to \"Unlock the power of Google AI on your iPhone.\"\n\nCurrently, the Gemini app for iOS is unavailable in most regions, including the US. Users in Canada, Australia, and India have also reported being unable to access the app, indicating that Google may be testing it in select areas before a wider release.\n\nSo far, only one user in the Philippines has reportedly managed to download the app, with screenshots suggesting it has been available in that country's App Store for about a week.\n\nThe new app introduces a feature called Gemini Live, which isn't available in the main Google app. According to the Reddit user, Gemini Live operates in the background with iOS's Live Activity while users multitask, providing a more seamless and convenient experience than the current setup.\n\nAt present, iOS users can only access Gemini by switching to the Gemini tab at the top of the Google search app, a process similar to that on the Gemini website. This method is less seamless and engaging compared to the experience Google offers on its Pixel devices.\n\nGoogle has yet to officially confirm development of a standalone Gemini app for iOS, so a global release date is uncertain. However, with testing seemingly underway, broader availability may come in the next few months.\n\nGemini is Google's AI chatbot powered by its namesake language model, introduced in late 2023 after unifying Bard and Duet AI to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The Gemini app launched on Android earlier this year, enabling users to process documents, summarize emails, and more."

It is also available in Gmail, Google Docs, and other Google services. On the best Android smartphones, Google Gemini is available as a standalone app and as a Google Assistant replacement. On iPhones, you can access the AI chatbot through the Gemini tab in the Google app, though the experience is not the same, with features like Gemini Live missing. This could soon change, with Google working on a standalone Gemini app for iPhone.\n\nGoogle has apparently released a dedicated Gemini app for the iPhone in the Philippines, though it is not yet ready for release and is still being tested. The screenshots and videos shared by leaker Aaron on X reveal that the app will provide access to Gemini Live and other advanced features.\n\nMore importantly, it will allow faster and direct access to Gemini. Right now, you must open the Google app on the iPhone and switch to the Gemini tab to talk to the AI chatbot.\n\nGot access to the new Google Gemini app for iOS pic.twitter.com/LZpWhQ9MjE Aaron (@aaronp613) November 10, 2024\n\nIt also supports Live Activity on the iPhone, so you can talk to the AI chatbot even when the app is not in the foreground.

The company envisions making Gemini a \"universal AI agent helpful in everyday life.\"\n\nTo achieve this, it is working on Project Jarvis, which will allow Gemini to book flights, buy products, and research topics for you. This will be powered by Gemini 2.0, which could be released this December. Google may release the standalone Gemini app for iPhone worldwide around the same time.\n\nA dedicated Gemini app will allow Google to roll out advanced Gemini features to iPhone users faster. Plus, it can help when Apple allows Gemini to integrate with Apple Intelligence."

        "article_content": "From brainstorming ideas to booking guests and outlining show topics, there\u2019s a lot of work involved with planning a podcast episode. Podcast planning templates can help you keep track of sponsors, manage your editing and production process, and even map out promotional content once your episodes go live.\n\nThese are some of my favorite free options for beginners, seasoned hosts, and everyone in between.\n\nmonday.com: A podcast planning template for smooth production\n\nmonday.com is one of my favorite project management tools on the market. It\u2019s a great way to plan your podcast because it has everything you need to stay organized and ensure none of your production tasks slip through the cracks.\n\nIt also has a great mobile app, allowing you to manage podcast planning from the palm of your hand.\n\nYou can sign up for monday.com\u2019s free plan to unlock access to 200+ templates, up to three project boards, eight custom column types, and seats for two collaborators. It\u2019s a great place to start or try it out but most teams will likely need to upgrade to a paid plan rather quickly.\n\nMore on monday.com: monday.com Review | monday.com vs Wrike | monday.com vs Airtable.\n\nI really like how the production flow is set up with this template. Instead of a single card for each episode that displays its status, every episode has its own list of dedicated tasks.\n\nFor example, the preparation phase may include tasks related to preparing questions for guests and outlining the episode structure. You can also have a post-production phase for things like editing clips to be promoted on social media before the final episode is polished and ready to live.\n\nThis kind of setup lets you get as granular as you\u2019d like without cluttering everything up.\n\nThe template also lets you estimate how much time each task should take. From there, you can enter the actuals and compare the difference.\n\nOverall, monday.com and this template are solid options for any podcaster, whether you\u2019re working by yourself or with a full team. It\u2019s easy to use, and the fact that you\u2019re getting the full power of monday.com\u2019s project management platform is a bonus that can\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nClickUp: Podcast planning templates for any type of show\n\nClickUp is another all-in-one project management and team collaboration platform. While this might seem like overkill for podcast planning, there\u2019s a free forever plan that\u2019s perfect for organizing just about everything.\n\nEach template below is more advanced than the one before it.\n\nThe right one for you depends on how much you want to lean on the tool, how many people you\u2019re working with, and how granular you want to be with post-production tracking.\n\nMore on ClickUp: ClickUp Review | ClickUp vs monday.com | ClickUp vs Notion.\n\nTemplate 1: A beginner-friendly option for planning episodes\n\nThis template is great for newer podcast hosts who just need something simple to plan upcoming episodes.\n\nIt comes with all of the basics you need to stay organized. You can create a backlog of episode ideas, categorize episodes, add audio files, and attach links to live episodes so everything\u2019s centralized in one place.\n\nMy favorite part about this podcast planning template is its simplicity.\n\nIt\u2019s organized into four sections that follow a linear flow \u2014 planned episodes, recorded episodes, shows that have been edited, and shows that have been published.\n\nBecause of its simplicity, you won\u2019t have to spend a ton of time figuring out how it works. It\u2019s just a matter of signing up and adding all of your ideas. Within minutes you\u2019ll be more organized and have far more insight into where everything stands in your production flow.\n\nThe biggest downside is that it\u2019s missing functionality for brainstorming, managing post-production tasks, and scaling beyond a single channel.\n\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, especially for newer shows. But bigger production teams will likely need to go with one of the other templates below.\n\nTemplate 2: Added features for managing different types of podcasts\n\nThis ClickUp template follows the same core concept of the previous one in the sense that all episodes are organized by stage in the production process.\n\nBut it takes it up a notch if you want more granular details about each episode.\n\nYou\u2019ll see the progress status of each episode updated in real-time as you or your team completes tasks required to get it live.\n\nThis template comes pre loaded with 17 custom attributes that you can use tag episodes and stay organized.\n\nThese range from topic categories to listens, subscriber information, and more.\n\nYou\u2019ll also be able to categorize each item by type. For each type, you can define a set structure that\u2019s applied when you add a new episode, so you don\u2019t have to outline all the steps every single time you add something new.\n\nSay you\u2019re planning an episode that includes a guest. If you tag that episode with this attribute, you can have your interview notes and questions available by default on that particular card.\n\nI also love the visual elements of this template. If you want to have a broad range of topics for your show, the color-coded topic column clearly indicates whether you have a good mix of ideas or too many episodes in one category.\n\nWhile you can use it to manage some post-production tasks, like your social media marketing plans, it\u2019s a bit more limited for this use compared to the template below.\n\nTemplate 3: The most advanced option for managing all pre and post-production tasks\n\nIf you have a well-established show with a full team working collaboratively to record, edit, and promote your show, this template has everything you\u2019ll need to stay organized before, during, and after production.\n\nI don\u2019t recommend it for solo podcasters and simple shows or if you\u2019re publishing less than an episode per week. You\u2019ll end up wasting time filling in details that don\u2019t matter yet.\n\nBut for teams producing episodes at scale, this template is a no-brainer.\n\nYou can set up multiple boards for different parts of the production flow. By default, there\u2019s a brainstorming board, backlog of topic lists, and even a place to organize requests from your listeners.\n\nOnce shows go live, you can pull in analytics to see which topics are performing the best so you can replicate that success with future episodes.\n\nFrom managing guest outreach and relationships with previous guests to planning social media posts and putting all episode assets in a single card, this template has it all.\n\nThere are multiple views, built-in statuses, collaborative documents, and a place to store all of your attachments.\n\nYour producers, editors, social team, and designers will be able to keep track of all their work in one place, giving managers and supervisors everything they need to track progress and fix issues before they become larger problems.\n\nAlthough ClickUp\u2019s free plan is fine to start, you\u2019ll need to upgrade to a paid plan to make the best use of all the advanced capabilities of this template.\n\nCoda: Highly customizable podcast planning templates\n\nCoda is a relational database and document creation solution with built in project management features. Unlike project management tools, Coda is a blank slate that lets you build different types of systems to match your needs.\n\nAs your needs change, you can update it to match your new workflows or add on to connect more pieces of your business.\n\nThe free plan is excellent, especially if you\u2019re working by yourself. But the best part is Coda\u2019s affordable pricing structure that only makes you pay for document creators. If you\u2019re the only person creating and building documents, you only have to pay for one user. All editors and viewers are completely free.\n\nMore on Coda: Coda Review | Coda vs Notion.\n\nTemplate 1: A full suite of templates to standardize your processes\n\nCoda\u2019s architecture is well suited for bringing dispersed data together in unique and creative ways. Because of that, one of its best practices is separating your systems into multiple areas and connecting them together as needed.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what this suite of templates helps you do.\n\nRather than trying to cram every element of podcast planning and production into one dashboard, you\u2019ll have separate areas for each phase.\n\nIt comes with sections for new ideas, episode planning, managing production flows, tracking released episodes, and more. There\u2019s even a space for keeping guest information organized.\n\nOne of the included templates makes it easy to create SOPs that define standardized elements for each stage of your production process. This ensures that hosts, editors, social media managers, and everyone in between has clear instructions every step of the way.\n\nIf someone is sick or leaves, anyone can jump in and follow the same SOPs to upload a new episode to YouTube.\n\nThis also acts as a checklist to ensure consistency for every episode \u2014 it serves as a reminder for things like adding the consistent intro and outro music to each show.\n\nFrom there, you can brainstorm new ideas, choose and plan episodes, track production tasks, and see a running list of live episodes. There\u2019s a full content calendar and a place to keep track of production tasks by phase. You\u2019ll even be able to add show notes and interview questions so everything\u2019s ready to go.\n\nThe weakest part of this template is the actual production flow tracking. It covers basic task tracking, but it\u2019s basic in comparison to others.\n\nHowever, you can build out more granularity if you need it.\n\nTemplate 2: A collaborative template that turns creative ideas into new episodes\n\nSimilar to the first option, this free podcast planning template from Coda combines multiple tools and resources into a single space. It comes with dozens of templates, including a content calendar, a place to organize live episodes, an area for sponsor information, and much more.\n\nBut what really makes this template unique is the way it\u2019s set up for brainstorming.\n\nNew ideas can come from anywhere, including while you\u2019re out on a walk, other teammates, your guests, your listeners, or even other departments in your business.\n\nWith this template, everyone has a dedicated space to take notes. On top of that, anyone can pitch ideas and work collaboratively to nail down those ideas before moving forward to the production process.\n\nIt lets you set up your own internal approvals process for episode ideas, and even pull recommendations from your audience submitted via social media.\n\nBy default, the template comes with a checklist of 20 tasks for each episode. Whoever completes a task can simply mark it as done, and the entire team will see it updated in real-time.\n\nIf the default list doesn\u2019t work for you, you can easily update it by adding, removing, or editing existing items based on your processes. Once you\u2019ve updated it, all new episodes will have your new list included automatically.\n\nThe biggest downside is that this template doesn\u2019t have much of a project-tracking element beyond this checklist and an editorial calendar.\n\nYou may need to use another template or build it out further to have a full end-to-end solution for planning, producing, and publishing episodes.\n\nStackby: A complete editorial calendar for podcasting planning and tracking revenue\n\nStackby is a no-code work platform that combines spreadsheets and databases into a single tool. While you may not automatically associate this type of software with podcast planning, it\u2019s actually a great way to plan episodes. Especially if you start with a template.\n\nIt\u2019s free for up to five users per workspace, making it a great choice for smaller teams with no budget or larger teams needing a flexible platform to work with.\n\nThis template includes a full editorial calendar that has all of the key information you need, including the host, idea, episode number, status, release date, and more.\n\nYou can switch between month, day, and week views, allowing you to zoom in and plan granular tasks or zoom out to see a high level release schedule for the month. The calendar is clean and well designed, especially compared to other tools that have basic calendar views.\n\nSEE: Discover more free editorial calendar templates for different platforms.\n\nThis template also includes other project views, including list, pipeline, and Kanban for getting work done.\n\nOne of the major standout features of this template is the ability to track revenue from different sponsors. You can easily keep track of your agreements, tag each episode with which sponsors are included, and import listener data to calculate how much revenue you\u2019re getting.\n\nSay one sponsor\u2019s CPM pays $25 for a 30-second ad. The template automatically calculates the total revenue based on the number of listens.\n\nThis is particularly helpful if you\u2019re running numerous ads from different sponsors, all with different terms.\n\nThe biggest downside of using Stackby is that it limits file upload sizes. Many episodes will be too big, so you\u2019ll need to keep these files elsewhere and link to the source instead.\n\nPodcast planning templates for Excel, Google Sheets, Microsoft Word, and PDF\n\nSimple production schedules or solo users may not need advanced software to stay organized.\n\nIf you prefer to keep things simple, there\u2019s nothing wrong with using a spreadsheet or document instead. These work particularly well if you don\u2019t need to collaborate with a lot of people or care about aesthetically pleasing views of all your episodes.\n\nTemplate 1: A basic calendar to manage recording and publishing dates\n\nSmartsheet is a powerful app builder. It\u2019s similar to Coda and monday.com but built more for power users. It doesn\u2019t have a free plan, but it does regularly publish free spreadsheets you can use in Google Sheets or Excel.\n\nThey don\u2019t offer podcast specific templates, but there are several generic options you can easily adapt to work for your needs.\n\nMy favorite Smartsheet template for podcasts is a general content calendar template that works for publishing any type of content, including podcast episodes. It\u2019s entirely free and compatible with Excel, Word, Google Sheets, and as a printable or digital PDF file.\n\nIt\u2019s a great option if you don\u2019t need much aside from visualizing your publishing schedule and planning at a high level.\n\nWhile most content calendars are for tracking publish dates, you can easily use built in color coded tags to schedule recording dates or even social media posts to promote published episodes as well.\n\nThe main downside of this template is that it will eventually start to feel cluttered, especially if you start adding a ton of items.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t have any task tracking capabilities for managing production work.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s a good place to start if you don\u2019t publish often.\n\nTemplate 2: A printer-friendly option for jotting show notes\n\nThis template, also from Smartsheet, offers a simple way to organize handwritten show notes to use during recording. You can open it with Microsoft Word or Google Docs and print out as many copies as you\u2019d like.\n\nThere are a lot of ways you can use this template, from mapping out content pillars to noting different talking points for different segments of your show.\n\nYou could also write down questions, plan episode structure, sponsorship information, or key points you don\u2019t want to forget. Sure, it\u2019s incredibly simple. But that\u2019s what makes it so versatile for people who enjoy writing things by hand.\n\nIt can also be super helpful during recording since you won\u2019t need a computer.\n\nHow to create your own podcast planning template\n\nIf you can\u2019t find anything that fits exactly what you\u2019re looking for, you can modify an existing template or create your own. Depending on how detailed you want to get, there are dozens of elements you might consider adding.\n\nAt a minimum, I recommend the following.\n\nAn area for brainstorming\n\nNew ideas can come up any time. It\u2019s important to have an easy way to note them down and keep track of them without too much hassle.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to have some way to turn these into full plans so you can track each idea through to completion, mark them for later, or write them off as ideas you aren\u2019t going to record for some reason or another.\n\nEpisode details\n\nEach episode likely has a ton of specific information you need to keep track of, including the topic, speakers, questions, structure, sponsors, backtracks, and more.\n\nIdeally, your template has an area to keep track of everything. This should be hyper-specific to the types of information you care about. For example, you may want to also have a field for the season or theme if you organize that way.\n\nLastly, you can set up a list of tasks, an outline, or other notes for different episode structures so you don\u2019t have to start each one from scratch.\n\nProduction workflow\n\nAside from episode information, it\u2019s helpful to know where each episode is in production. This is particularly important if you\u2019re working with a team, but even solo users have a lot to gain from staying organized like this.\n\nYour setup can be as simple or complex as you\u2019d like. For some, a simple flow with a backlog, in progress, recorded, editing, and published is more than enough.\n\nOthers may want more in-depth project management capabilities like due dates, task assignments, progress tracking, and more.\n\nMonetization and sponsorship details\n\nWhether running ads, mentioning sponsors, or selling your own products and services, it\u2019s a good idea to decide this up front before you start recording.\n\nYou could also plan to pre-record snippets and add them in during editing. However you decide to do it, keeping track of all these details alongside your episodes and other files can help keep everything organized.\n\nPost-production marketing\n\nWhat happens once an episode airs? Do you publish a few social media posts, send out an email, or post about it on your blog?\n\nPublishing those types of content is no different than publishing a podcast so it shouldn\u2019t be too challenging to figure out how to keep track of other elements in the same place. You could do the same if you publish the same episode on multiple platforms.\n\nPodcast planning best practices\n\nPlanning a podcast is a lot easier said than done.\n\nHere are some pro tips to keep in mind if you\u2019re struggling, working through your first few episodes, or looking for a bit of guidance:\n\nStay organized and consistent.\n\nDon\u2019t overcomplicate the creative process.\n\nBrainstorm as many topics as possible.\n\nGet comfortable throwing out ideas you don\u2019t like.\n\nOutline the flow of an episode, but don\u2019t write a script.\n\nDecide on episode length before you start.\n\nSchedule guests in advance and always have a backup.\n\nGive yourself plenty of time for editing and post-production.\n\nDocument everything.\n\nThe main goal is staying organized and keeping track of all the moving pieces. If you can do that, you\u2019ll learn the rest as you go.\n\nYour first 20+ episodes won\u2019t be perfect and you may feel completely scattered \u2014 both are entirely normal. Over time, you\u2019ll notice significant improvements in your delivery, banter, ideas, sponsorship plugs, workflows, and editing capabilities."

        "article_content": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is concerned that Tesla\u2019s use of social media and its website makes false promises about the automaker\u2019s full-self driving (FSD) software.\n\nThe warning dates back from May, but was made public in an email to Tesla released on November 8.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe NHTSA opened an investigation in October into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with the FSD software, following three reported collisions and a fatal crash. The investigation centers on FSD\u2019s ability to perform in \u201crelatively common\u201d reduced visibility conditions, such as sun glare, fog, and airborne dust.\n\nIn these instances, it appears that \u201cthe driver may not be aware that he or she is responsible\u201d to make appropriate operational selections, or \u201cfully understand\u201d the nuances of the system, NHTSA said.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cTesla\u2019s X (Twitter) account has reposted or endorsed postings that exhibit disengaged driver behavior,\u201d Gregory Magno, the NHTSA\u2019s vehicle defects chief investigator, wrote to Tesla in an email.\n\nThe postings, which included reposted YouTube videos, may encourage viewers to see FSD-supervised as a \u201cRobotaxi\u201d instead of a partially automated, driver-assist system that requires \u201cpersistent attention and intermittent intervention by the driver,\u201d Magno said.\n\nIn one of a number of Tesla posts on X, the social media platform owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a driver was seen using FSD to reach a hospital while undergoing a heart attack. In another post, a driver said he had used FSD for a 50-minute ride home. Meanwhile, third-party comments on the posts promoted the advantages of using FSD while under the influence of alcohol or when tired, NHTSA said.\n\nTesla\u2019s official website also promotes conflicting messaging on the capabilities of the FSD software, the regulator said.\n\nNHTSA has requested that Tesla revisit its communications to ensure its messaging remains consistent with FSD\u2019s approved instructions, namely that the software provides only a driver assist/support system requiring drivers to remain vigilant and maintain constant readiness to intervene in driving.\n\nTesla last month unveiled the Cybercab, an autonomous-driving EV with no steering wheel or pedals. The vehicle has been promoted as a robotaxi, a self-driving vehicle operated as part of a ride-paying service, such as the one already offered by Alphabet-owned Waymo.\n\nBut Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology has remained under the scrutiny of regulators. FSD relies on multiple onboard cameras to feed machine-learning models that, in turn, help the car make decisions based on what it sees.\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo\u2019s technology relies on premapped roads, sensors, cameras, radar, and lidar (a laser-light radar), which might be very costly, but has met the approval of safety regulators."

        "article_content": "Representative Image\n\nGenAI, chips and more\n\nSmartphones are becoming increasingly expensive, driven by a combination of factors including the rising cost of advanced components, the transition to 5G technology, and the integration of cutting-edge features like generative AI.According to Counterpoint Research, the global average selling price (ASP) of smartphones is projected to rise by 3% in 2024 and an additional 5% in 2025. This upward trend is largely attributed to the increasing demand for premium devices equipped with powerful processors and advanced AI capabilities.Generative AI, in particular, is a significant driver of smartphone premiumization. As consumers become more interested in AI-powered features, smartphone manufacturers are investing heavily in developing SoCs with enhanced CPU, NPU, and GPU capabilities. This increased complexity and performance come at a higher cost. \u201cAs we enter the AI smartphone era, the integration of GenAI features is expected to continue this upward trend,\u201d the report said.The transition to advanced manufacturing processes, such as 4nm and 3nm, is also contributing to rising component costs. These processes enable smaller, more efficient chips but require significant investments in research and development.In addition to hardware advancements, the increasing complexity of software and AI algorithms is further driving up costs. As smartphones become more sophisticated, manufacturers need to allocate more resources to software development and optimization.While the rising prices may be a concern for consumers, the benefits of these advancements are undeniable. AI-powered smartphones offer a range of innovative features, from improved camera performance to more intelligent virtual assistants. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more powerful and feature-rich smartphones in the future."
