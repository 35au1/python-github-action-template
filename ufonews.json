The U.S. Government may be forced to release \"top-secret\" footage on extraterrestrial life - something Trump previously vowed to do if he were to return to the White House, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: MEGA Trump won the presidential election on Tuesday night.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nNick Pope, a former Ministry of Defence UFO expert, said the 47th president could give consipracists \"hope\" with plans on \"delivering disclosure\" on otherwordly beings. He said: \"It's the perfect storm: a maverick, populist President in his second term, and - thus - not up for re-election.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: MEGA Trump took victory over Democratic candidate Harris on Tuesday after surpassing 270 electoral votes.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"For those in the UFO community who believe there's been a decades-long conspiracy to cover up the truth about an alien presence, Trump in his second term offers the best-ever hope for pushing back against the Deep State and delivering disclosure.\" Trump previously pledged to unveil top-secret UFO footage if re-elected, vowing to push the Pentagon to declassify the videos and release them to the public.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nPope himself is hoping the ordeal will happen sooner rather than later. He said: \"I believe Trump views the subject in the same way as he views the JFK files, where, if there's top-secret information still being withheld, it should be declassified.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"As he seems to link the two issues, there's a strong possibility of bombshell UFO information being released early in 2025, soon after his inauguration.\" During his first presidency, Trump released documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy - vowing to unveil the rest of them if re-elected.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhile appearing on a podcast in September, Trump said he would pressure Pentagon officials to declassify videos of alleged UFO sightings. Host Lex Fridman asked: \"Will you help push the Pentagon to release more footage, which a lot of people claim is available?\" Trump replied: \"Oh yeah, sure, I'll do that. I would do that. I'd love to do that. I have to do that.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: MEGA Trump won the election on Tuesday night against Kamala Harris.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHis interview with Fridman wasn't the first time Trump teased top-secret information on UFOs and \"life on other planets\". He previously claimed he heard \"interesting things\" about aliens while suggesting he would declassify files related to the Roswell UFO, which is regarded as one of the most infamous unexplained incidents in U.S. history \u2013 and has led to Roswell, New Mexico, becoming a mecca for UFO enthusiasts.\n\nDAILY. BREAKING. CELEBRITY NEWS. ALL FREE.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nTrump's vow to declassify files on UFO comes after whistleblower David Charles Grusch, a former intelligence officer, came forward in 2023 and claimed the U.S. government collaborated with aerospace companies on a top-secret UFO retrieval program. Grusch eventually testified before congress, where he alleged the program involved the recovery of \"non-human spacecraft\" and their deceased pilots.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nLast month, Trump appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast shortly before Election Day, where the topic came up over the course of the three-hour schmooze. Trump revealed he had spoken to pilots who claimed to have seen strange objects in the sky after Rogan asked if he had received any information about ET life during his presidency.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHe said: \"There is a lot of interest in the people coming from space, you know,\" to which Rogan asked: \"How much did they tell you about that?\" Trump replied: \"A lot.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHe added: \"I have to be honest, I have never been a believer \u2026 [But] I interviewed jet pilots that were solid people, perfect. I mean, great pilots, great everything. And they said we saw things sir that were very strange, like a round ball. \"But it wasn\u2019t a comet or a meteor it was something, and it was going four times faster than an F-22 which is a very fast plane.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: YOUTUBE/JREClips Trump discussed his views on extraterrestrial life during a recent interview on Rogan's podcast.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAfter Rogan asked Trump his thoughts on aliens, the president-elect replied: \"There's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don\u2019t have life\", which was met with Rogan's rebuttal on the U.S. having rovers on the planet for decades and not finding any evidence of life. Trump argued back: \"Well, maybe it's life that we don't know, but maybe it's a different kind of life.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nLast year, Republican senators called on Pentagon officials to take alleged sightings of UFOs seriously, which prompted an investigation by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). Earlier this year, the Pentagon published a 63-page report declaring no evidence of aliens or extraterrestrial technology on Earth."

        "article_content": "US Congress has promised to 'pull back the curtain' on secret UAP research programs conducted in the shadows of the government in a court of law.\n\nA second slew of hearings into UFOs is scheduled for November 13, led by the House Oversight Committee, with former military officials and an aerospace expert set to testify about their knowledge of secret US programs.\n\nLawmakers have promised 'to explore firsthand accounts of [UFOs]' and 'assess the federal government's transparency and accountability regarding their 'possible threats to national security.'\n\nRep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), a member of the subcommittee, said: 'The Pentagon and Washington bureaucrats have kept this information hidden for decades, and we're finally going to shed some light on it.\n\n'We're bringing in credible witnesses who can provide public testimony because the American people deserve the truth. We're done with the cover-ups.'\n\nThere will be four witnesses set to testify under oath, including former Department of Defense Official Luis Elizondo and former NASA Associate Administrator Michael Gold.\n\nCongress is set to hold a second hearing about UAPs that it promised will expose the truth to the American public, specifically about the research programs within the government. Pictured is the famous Tic Tac-shaped object seen in the sky over California on November 10, 2004\n\nNext week's hearing, set for 11:30am ET, will be a joint effort by Rep Nancy Mace (R-SC) and Rep Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.).\n\n'This is our second hearing on the topic of UAPs and the American people are tired of the obfuscation and refusal to release information by the federal government, they said in a shared statement.\n\n'Americans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose.\n\n'We can only ensure that understanding by providing consistent, systemic transparency. We look forward to hearing from expert witnesses on ways to shed more light and bring greater accountability to this issue.'\n\nThe committee has not released details on cases to be presented on Wednesday but provided the list of witnesses.\n\nElizondo, a career US Army counterintelligence specialist, previously ran the military's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.\n\nHe recently hosted a private event in Philadelphia on October 28 to reveal an image of an alleged UFO 'mothership.'\n\nThere will be four witnesses set to testify under oath, including former Department of Defense Official Luis Elizondo (pictured)\n\nElizondo recently hosted a private event in Philadelphia on October 28 to reveal an image of an alleged UFO 'mothership.'\n\n'There's a whole lot more here folks,' Elizondo told the audience in a leaked clip. 'I just want to give you kind of a small taste of what's going on 'behind the scenes.''\n\n'We're having pilots, military pilots and civilian pilots in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, report what unimaginably seems impossible,' as Elizondo explained his 'real photo' of a UFO.\n\n'They described it literally 'the mothership,' Elizondo said.\n\nInvestigative journalist Michael Shellenberger will also be sworn under oath.\n\nShellenberger \u2014 who is also an academic and a two-time candidate for California governor \u2014 went viral last month after publishing one of his anonymous whistleblower's accounts of an alleged UFO data collection program.\n\nThat classified UFO data retrieval effort, dubbed 'Immaculate Constellation,' was established in 2017 to 'detect' and 'quarantine' the military's best UFO imagery, along with its best videos, witness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nDr Tim Gallaudet, former rear admiral in the US Navy, launched a probe in March into unidentified submersible objects (USOs), specifically strange sightings on the seabed off the coast of California.\n\nInvestigative journalist Michael Shellenberger will also be sworn under oath. He went viral last month after publishing one of his anonymous whistleblower's accounts of an alleged UFO data collection program\n\nGold is a former NASA Associate Administrator who was part of the agency's UAP study in October 2022, which focused solely on unclassified data.\n\nOver nine months, the independent study team will lay the groundwork for future studies on the nature of UAPs for NASA and other organizations.\n\nThe hearing follows the bombshell case last year that was held by Burchett and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla).\n\nDavid Grusch - a former high-ranking intelligence official - was one of three military whistleblowers who testified under oath that they had firsthand encounters or knowledge about secret government programs involving technology that is 'non-human.'\n\nHe claimed that the US has been in possession of UFOs since 'the 1930s' and has been secretly back-engineering them and carrying out a public disinformation campaign to prevent the details from leaking publicly.\n\nRyan Graves, a former pilot, Air Force and intelligence agency veteran David Grusch and Navy veteran fighter pilot Commander David Fravor spoke at the first hearing in 2023\n\nDuring the hearing, Burchett asked Grusch: 'Personally, have you heard anyone [has] been murdered?'\n\nGrusch replied: 'I have to be careful answering that question. I directed people with that knowledge to the appropriate authorities.'\n\nHe was sworn in Wednesday, along with Ryan Graves, an esteemed former pilot, and Navy veteran fighter pilot Commander David Fravor, who witnessed the 2004 'Tic Tac' UFO.\n\nGraves, a former F-18 pilot with over a decade of service in the US Navy, was the first to give opening statements.\n\n'My testimony is based on information I've been given by individuals with a long-standing track record of legitimacy and service to this country, many of whom have shared compelling evidence in the form of photography, official documentation and classified oral testimony to myself and many various colleagues,' Graves told lawmakers, stating he was driven to share it by a 'commitment to truth and transparency.'\n\nBurchett described the 2023 hearing as 'historical.'\n\n'I'd like to thank these three brave witnesses here. They took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and, dagnammit, they're doing it,' he continued.\n\n'We're not bringing little green men or flying saucers into the hearing \u2014 sorry to disappoint about half of y'all \u2014 we're just going to get to the facts.\n\n'We're going to uncover the cover-up, and I hope this is just the beginning of many more hearings and many more people coming forward about this.'"

In a just world, it'd be battling the big hitters for Game of the Year plaudits.\n\nIf you're even a casual fan of retro games, this is an undeniable must-buy."

        "article_content": "Amazon is considering investing billions of dollars in Anthropic, doubling down on a huge deal the companies struck this year, The Information reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne reason Amazon is so keen on Anthropic: The AI startup has been gaining on its rival OpenAI in recent months, according to data from a popular developer tool.\n\nThe AI SDK is a tool kit that helps developers build AI-powered applications. It provides code libraries that developers install to get their apps to communicate with different AI models. Data is published regularly showing how many times these code packages are downloaded each week.\n\nThis is a useful window into how popular the top AI models are with developers, a key constituency of early tech adopters.\n\nThe data shows that OpenAI remains in the lead but that Anthropic has been growing faster lately in terms of developer mindshare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the week of August 18, developers downloaded the OpenAI code library almost 229,000 times. The equivalent Anthropic library was downloaded almost 38,000 times.\n\nIn late October, OpenAI downloads were relatively unchanged, while Anthropic downloads were much higher: about 244,000 for OpenAI and 100,000 for Anthropic.\n\nData from NPM Trends. NPM Trends\n\nThe recent adoption trends can be partly explained by a new AI model Anthropic released in June.\n\n\"Anthropic's recent gains can be attributed to their Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, which, among many tasks, excels at understanding and generating code,\" said Jared Palmer, a vice president of AI at Vercel, a startup that offers the AI SDK and other developer tools. \"Its combination of speed, cost, and output quality has won over the developer community for the time being.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet has been particularly useful for tasks that developers need to do regularly, such as generating, checking, and fixing software code.\n\nStill, OpenAI has maintained its lead among developers because of its first-mover advantage and factors such as cheap pricing of its GPT-4o-mini AI model and strong developer tooling and documentation.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThere's also pretty widespread adoption of its API, or application programming interface. This is a common way for different software applications to communicate and share data.\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that OpenAI's lead is inflated by the download data. That's because many AI-model providers have adopted OpenAI's API specification as a de facto standard. That allows developers to use the same OpenAI code library package but point their apps to different models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's hard to quantify how much this exaggerates OpenAI's lead, but the inflation of OpenAI's numbers here supports the general conclusion that Anthropic has been gaining on its main rival in recent months.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said usage of the startup's API had doubled since it released its GPT-4o mini AI model in July. The spokesperson added that OpenAI had also tripled the number of active apps running in production on its platform in the past year.\n\nThe OpenAI spokesperson criticized the data, saying downloads of these code libraries aren't an accurate representation of developer audience since they don't reflect actual usage or spending.\n\nAnthropic had no problem with the data. The company said its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model helped developers handle complex software architecture and multistep processes. It added that enterprises were increasingly adopting Claude for business-critical functions where accuracy is key, such as software development and data analysis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Our new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model is the ideal choice for developers to build AI-powered applications with state-of-the-art performance across the board, including coding, complex financial analysis, and live chat support,\" Dianne Penn, a product lead at Anthropic, told Business Insider.\n\nPenn cited DoorDash, Sourcegraph, and GitLab as companies using Claude to reduce development time, increase code acceptance rates, and build AI features."

Still with us?\n\nThanks to this, the hybrid model accounted for the JWST's observations and also put the universe's age to 26.7 billion years.\n\nAdvert\n\nAlthough the Hubble Space Telescope had already guessed at the 'impossible early galaxy' issue, the JWST's launch in December 2021 strengthened these claims.\n\nNow, scientists have a clear picture of when the universe came to be, and this could help them in the future to recalculate the date of emerging planets, among other things.\n\nAs the universe continues to be a vast space of confusion for us to wrap our heads around, at least this one thing has been put to bed at last."

Pompeii and Herculaneum were two settlements wiped off the face of the Earth and buried under pyroclastic surges, with left victims frozen in suspended actions as they instantly died.\n\nTo this day the death toll remains unknown, with 20,000 people living in both cities. So far, remains of more than 1,500 people have been found across the two locations.\n\nAfter the ruins of Pompeii were excavated, with it now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the desperate remains of people caught up in the eruption were found by archeologists.\n\nAdvert\n\nCast of a man with a child, both of whom died in Pompeii (Marilla Sicilia/Archivio Marilla Sicilia/Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images)\n\nObservers who look at such remains see the final moments and stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.\n\nBut new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem, and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.\n\n\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d\n\nMs Mittnik and her colleagues carried out tests on 14 casts of victims found in Pompeii's ruins, where they found that they had been wrongly identified.\n\nIt wasn't just people who perished in the eruption (Ivan Romano/Getty Images)\n\nInstead of being family, one cast of a man holding a child found that the youngster was unrelated to the person assumed to be their parent. This discovery was found in a location known as 'the house of the golden bracelet'; named after an intricate piece of jewellery, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd at least one of the two people locked in an embrace, long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter, was a man. Their research was published on Thursday in the journal Current Biology.\n\nLong thought to be a sister with their mother or daughter, the other person was in fact a man (Archaeological Park of Pompeii)\n\nThe study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.\n\n\u201cThey have a better overview of what\u2019s happening in Pompeii because they analysed different samples,\u201d said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cWe actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\u201d"

In it, they said Trump would be \u201cselecting personnel to serve our nation under his leadership and enact policies that make the life of Americans affordable, safe, and secure\u201d in the coming weeks from \u201ca wide array of experts\u201d they\u2019ve assembled for his review.\n\nOne day later, Trump\u2019s transition team issued another press release announcing that the president-elect had made his first major staffing decision of his second term \u2014 the selection of longtime Republican operative and de facto 2024 campaign manager Susie Wiles to be his White House chief of staff.\n\nWiles will be the first woman to serve in the White House\u2019s top staff role, one that was largely thankless during Trump\u2019s first term. Over his four years in the White House from 2017 to 2021, Trump cycled through four chiefs of staff, with all but one exiting after trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to bring a semblance of order to the freewheeling style preferred by the ex-real estate mogul turned television star turned politician.\n\nHe is famous for encouraging, even relishing, internal conflicts and internecine warfare among his closest aides. It\u2019s said that he is as entertained by the infighting as viewers of The Apprentice were before he ended episodes by firing whoever lost the internal competition.\n\nBut Wiles, the daughter of legendary NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall and a renowned GOP power player in her own right, isn\u2019t one to embrace the drama. The campaign she ran along with veteran strategist Chris LaCivita was relatively drama-free and leak-averse compared with Trump\u2019s first two presidential efforts.\n\nOne Trumpworld veteran who spoke to The Independent on condition of anonymity said the pick is an indicator of the president-elect\u2019s respect for and trust in Wiles, who took over his political operation when he was in the veritable wilderness, reeling from the backlash to January 6th. The source described Wiles as a rare person who has the ability to say \u201cno\u201d to Donald Trump.\n\nThe Independent understands that Trump\u2019s selection of Wiles early on was meant to take some of the pressure off him from supporters and office-seekers who\u2019ve come calling in the days since his victory in hopes of bending his ear or securing roles in his new administration.\n\nIn theory, this means Wiles \u2014 not the president-elect \u2014 can be the point person for naming key staff roles and helping to roll out new appointment announcements.\n\nBut the transition team Trump has at his disposal isn\u2019t looking much like the one that ushered him into the White House in 2017. That was a chaotic effort compounded by his decision to replace voluminous plans assembled by then-New Jersey governor Chris Christie with a slapdash plan nominally headed up by Mike Pence. In actuality, it became a two-headed hydra of an operation with rival power bases in Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and then-incoming White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nIvanka Trump\u2019s husband Jared Kushner took a central role in the first Trump administration (REUTERS)\n\nBack then, Trump\u2019s transition team followed precedent and procedure by working with the General Services Administration, the government agency that by law provides incoming administrations with official office space and other resources, including what is needed for incoming administration officials to obtain security clearances and liaise with the myriad federal agencies they will have to staff and supervise at noon on January 20, 2025.\n\nBut this time, it appears the Trump team could eschew much of the official support in favor of a privatized model without precedent in modern history.\n\nThe initial statement released by transition chairs Lutnick and McMahon referenced \u201cthe next steps of Trump Vance 2025 Transition, Inc., a 501(c)(4) organization,\u201d indicating that the new-look Trump team wants to keep the federal government \u2014 including the civil servants that are tasked with assisting the transition \u2014 away from the people who will soon lead the federal government.\n\nTo start, a 501(c)(4) organization, named for the section of the Internal Revenue Code that authorizes such \u201csocial welfare\u201d organizations, aren\u2019t required to publicly disclose their donors. And by keeping the transition off of any official government email systems, the Trump team can evade having their emails requested by any Democratic or nonpartisan transparency groups under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAs of now, the Trump transition hasn\u2019t signed the memoranda of understanding that officially starts the transition process by letting the incoming team interface with the GSA and gain access to \u201coffice space, IT equipment, office supplies, fleet vehicles, mail management, and payment of compensation and other expenses\u201d available after an election is conceded.\n\nAlthough the agency notified the Trump team that it\u2019s eligible for government support on Wednesday, hours after Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the race to the president-elect, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that there\u2019s been no official acceptance of the offer. But she did say that Biden\u2019s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, has \u201creached out\u201d to the Trump team. She stressed that they would \u201cleave that line of communications open\u201d in hopes of facilitating \u201can effective, efficient transition of power.\u201d\n\nYet Trump allies are indicating that the transition may not be so smooth.\n\nReporting from The New York Times and other outlets has also indicated that Trump and his team are strongly considering skipping the process by which administration officials normally obtain security clearances after FBI background checks.\n\nInstead, Trump aides have reportedly argued for the president-elect to unilaterally grant clearances to top aides based on private background investigations done by a firm contracted by the transition.\n\nAlready, Trump-aligned groups such as Stephen Miller\u2019s America First Legal are publicly railing against the FBI and accusing it of illegally leaking information on presidential nominees to congressional staff. The group said in a press release that the Department of Justice-led process \u201chas been and will be weaponized against nominees in any future administration, including the Trump Administration.\u201d\n\nBecause security clearances are an executive function, the president can grant anyone a clearance at any level for any reason, even over the objections of the national security professionals who assess whether a given individual can be trusted with the nation\u2019s secrets. And as an elected official, Trump himself is exempt from clearance requirements despite his long and documented history of mishandling and allegedly unlawfully retaining national defense information.\n\nHe exercised this unilateral authority during his first term when he ordered his second chief of staff, John Kelly, to grant Kushner, then a White House senior adviser, a permanent \u201ctop secret\u201d security clearance after a months-long period during which the real estate scion was only allowed a much lower level \u201csecret\u201d one. Though Kushner had been allocated the \u201ctop secret\u201d credential on an interim basis early on in the first Trump administration, that temporary clearance was pulled and replaced with much lower \u201csecret\u201d clearance after national security officials and then-White House counsel Don McGahn raised concerns flagged by the US intelligence community about the president\u2019s son-in-law.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Kelly was so disturbed by the move that he authored a contemporaneous memorandum in which he wrote that he\u2019d been directly ordered to grant Kushner the clearance over the objections from both McGahn and the CIA.\n\nA former White House security adviser, Tricia Newbold, was similarly troubled by decisions around clearances in the early days of Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 so much so that she went to Congress with her concerns seeking whistleblower status. She told Democrats on the House Oversight Committee that numerous Trump appointees were denied clearances because of foreign influence concerns, conflicts of interest, financial issues, questionable conduct and even illicit drug use.\n\nIt\u2019s not fully clear what criteria the new Trump administration might use to grant access to sensitive information this time around if not those used by the FBI.\n\nUsually, appointees are screened for foreign ties, potential conflicts of interest, and susceptibility to blackmail. But given Trump\u2019s well-documented obsession with loyalty, it\u2019s very possible that fealty to the new administration \u2014 not the United States itself \u2014 could become an important metric.\n\nTo that end, Trump administration hopefuls are already flocking to his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida, where he and his team are making their plans, in hopes of kissing the ring and securing the new president\u2019s favor."

The classic brand has been reinvigorated under Volkswagen Group, and not only that, but it has already announced two new vehicles that it plans to launch in the next few years. Of the two, the Scout Terra is the electric truck, and it\u2019s built to offer a modern design with an excellent range and fast performance.\n\nBut how does the Scout Terra compare with another popular electric truck, the Tesla Cybertruck? While the Scout Terra is set to be much cheaper than the Cybertruck is now, it\u2019s entirely possible that by the time the Terra is released, it could have a higher price tag than expected, while Tesla lowers the price tag of the Cybertruck. Is one of these trucks objectively better? We put the two head-to-head to find out.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDesign\n\nThe Scout Terra and the Tesla Cybertruck arguably couldn\u2019t be further apart in terms of design. Of course, variation is a good thing, at least as long as both options are solid under the hood too.\n\nYou likely know what the Tesla Cybertruck looks like; it\u2019s pretty famous. The Cybertruck is angular and metallic, with an angled light bar along the front and a triangular side profile. Some love it, and some hate it. Personally, it\u2019s not for me. But if your vision of the future happens to align with Tesla\u2019s, maybe you\u2019ll find it to be futuristic and modern.\n\nI hope the future looks a little more like the Scout Terra though. The Terra offers a slightly more rounded design and looks like a modern take on the traditional truck design. It\u2019s got thin LED headlights at the front, coupled with a new approach to the classic Scout black mask.\n\nThe Cybertruck has a bed size of around 6 feet long and 4 feet wide, which is large enough for most use-cases. The Terra\u2019s bed isn\u2019t quite as large, measuring 5.5 feet long.\n\nI\u2019ve made my opinions about design clear, but ultimately design preferences are subjective, and your opinions may differ. For that reason, this category is a tie.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nInterior and tech\n\nThe interiors of these vehicles are quite different too. While the exterior of the Cybertruck looks radically different from anything else that Tesla has built, the interior isn\u2019t quite as novel, though it is still unique. The Cybertruck has a very minimalistic interior with plenty of storage and a large infotainment display. That display actually doubles as an instrument monitoring screen, as there\u2019s no display behind the steering wheel. The Cybertruck has enough room for five people, including the driver.\n\nThe Scout Terra hearkens back to the past a little more, but in a good way. It\u2019s not quite as minimalistic, but it looks very premium and well-built, also offering tons of room for storage. Perhaps even cooler is that the Terra has an option for a front-row bench seat, which takes away much of the storage but allows for six total occupants instead of five. In the Terra, there are two screens: one for instrument monitoring and the other for infotainment. Not only that but there are plenty of physical controls for settings like climate and audio. This means you don\u2019t have to go digging through settings in the software just to change the fan speed.\n\nSpeaking of software, we don\u2019t yet have a good idea of what the Terra\u2019s software will be like. We\u2019re hoping it will be similar to Rivian\u2019s, given the fact that Volkswagen and Rivian have a partnership. However, it\u2019s entirely possible that it will be closer to a typical Android Automotive design. The Cybertruck offers the same software as other Tesla vehicles, which is a good thing. Tesla is considered to offer among the best software experiences in a car right now \u2014 matched only by the likes of Rivian.\n\nGiven the fact that we don\u2019t yet know what the software in the Terra will be like, we can really only compare interior design. I like having physical controls, but again, that\u2019s a subjective decision. This one\u2019s a tie as well.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nPerformance\n\nPerformance is one area where we can start to make some objective comparisons. At the time of this writing, the Cybertruck was available in two trims: the main All-Wheel Drive trim and the so-called Cyberbeast trim. The AWD model offers an 11,000-pound towing capacity and the ability to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds. The Cyberbeast has the same towing capacity but increases the acceleration speed to 2.6 seconds. That\u2019s extremely quick and faster than the vast majority of production vehicles on the roads today.\n\nThe Scout Terra isn\u2019t out just yet, so we can only go off Scout\u2019s performance-related claims. According to the company, the Terra is rated to tow up to 10,000 pounds and will accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. That\u2019s faster than the base Cybertruck but obviously slower than the Cyberbeast. It\u2019s possible and even likely that other models of the Terra will be available at some point down the line, offering faster acceleration or better towing capacity. Though to be clear, a 10,000-pound towing capacity is still pretty good.\n\nRegardless, as it stands right now, the Terra won\u2019t be able to tow as much as the Cybertruck, nor will it have an option to accelerate as quickly as the Cyberbeast. Tesla wins this round.\n\nWinner: Tesla Cybertruck\n\nRange and charging\n\nRange and charging speed are a little different between these two vehicles as well. Range on the Cybertruck is 301 miles for the Cyberbeast or 325 miles for the AWD model. The vehicle is able to charge at up to 350kW on Tesla\u2019s latest0-generation Superchargers, or at other charging stations that support those fast speeds.\n\nThe Cybertruck will soon have an option for a range extender, though. This range extender is essentially a large battery that will take up some room in the truck bed and will bring the total range to a little over 450 miles. That\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s a shame that you have to use up bed space to get it.\n\nThe Scout Terra will be able to charge quickly too, supporting 350kW charging speeds. Not only that but the Terra will also offer a long range. The base model of the Scout Terra is fully electric and offers a 350-mile range according to Scout. That\u2019s better than what the Cybertruck can offer right now. Additionally, Scout says that it will be selling an EREV, or extended range EV model of the Terra. This makes use of a small gasoline generator that can extend the range to an impressive 500 miles.\n\nThe base model of the Scout Terra has a longer range than the most expensive Cybertruck, and with the EREV option, the Terra has a longer range than the Cybertruck with its to-be-released range extender. This category goes to Scout.\n\nWinner: Scout Terra\n\nPrice and availability\n\nThe price and availability category is kind of fixed. Why? Well, only one of these trucks is actually available right now: the Cybertruck. The Cybertruck has been on sale for some time now, and you can get one for yourself if you want. The base model at the time of this writing was the AWD model, and it came at $79,990. The Cyberbeast model steps that up to $99,990, which isn\u2019t cheap.\n\nThe Scout Terra has only just been announced, and Scout says that production will begin in 2027, meaning that it may not be until the end of 2027 or early 2028 before you can actually buy one. That said, the price of the truck is expected to be cheaper than the Cybertruck, and Scout says that it will start at under $60,000. It\u2019s entirely possible that the Cybertruck will be cheaper by then, especially if Tesla launches a single motor rear-wheel drive Cybertruck, which it says it will launch in 2025.\n\nSpeculation aside, the Cybertruck gets an easy win here for the simple fact that it\u2019s the only truck you can currently buy.\n\nWinner: Tesla Cybertruck\n\nOverall winner: Tesla Cybertruck\n\nTesla has won two of these categories, while Scout only has one, so technically Tesla gets the win here. That said, the win is based on a number of variables. For example, if you prefer the design and interior of the Scout, it might win two more points and be the better option for you. Not only that but if Scout is released with a lower price tag than the Cybertruck, it\u2019ll win the price and availability category and be the better option overall.\n\nMy advice? If you want an electric truck right now, don\u2019t buy either of these; buy the Rivian R1T. It has a longer range and faster performance than the Cybertruck, while also starting at a lower price. That said, once the Scout Terra is released, hopefully we\u2019ll see a little more competition in the modern electric truck space."
