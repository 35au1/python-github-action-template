        "article_content": "Join Ross Coulthart for a LIVE Q&A on NewsNation\u2019s YouTube, X and Facebook pages at 4p/3C Wednesday following a House hearing on UAPs. Coulthart will break down testimony from former NASA administrator Michael Gold, Pentagon insider Lue Elizondo, journalist Michael Shellenberger and Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet.\n\n(NewsNation) \u2014 At a House of Representatives committee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena Wednesday, lawmakers will hear from a number of witnesses about what they have seen and heard about UFOs.\n\nHeld by the House Oversight Committee, the hearing, titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u201d will begin at 11:30 a.m. ET.\n\nLuis Elizondo, a former Pentagon insider, veteran and investigator; retired Navy Rear Adm. Timothy Gallaudet; journalist Michael Shellenberger and Michael Gold, a former NASA administrator, are scheduled to give their testimony.\n\nThis hearing is the first since the summer of 2023, which was sparked by career intelligence official David Grusch\u2018s allegations that the Pentagon has been operating a secret UFO retrieval program.\n\n\u201cIf the UFO hearings catch on with the public, we could be in for quite a ride,\u201d Bryce Zabel, UFO author and cohost of the podcast \u201cNeed to Know\u201d with Ross Coulthart, told NewsNation. \u201cBack in 1973, all of America was riveted to the Senate Watergate hearings, and the cover-up Nixon orchestrated will seem small compared to the one that would have been necessary to hide the truth about alien contact for nearly eight decades now.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re gonna learn some things\u2019 about UFOs: Rep. Tim Burchett\n\nWhat will UAP witnesses say at hearing?\n\nElizondo\u2019s book \u201cImminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt for UFOs\u201d alleges that the United States military has been running a UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program for years, even recovering nonhuman specimens.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: UAP are real. Advanced technologies not made by our Government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe,\u201d Elizondo will say, according to testimony published the day before the hearing.\n\nHe will talk about what actions the government should be taking regarding the UAP issue.\n\nGallaudet, in his testimony, plans to repeat a claim he\u2019s made before to NewsNation: that an email that contained what is known as the \u201cGo Fast\u201d video, disappeared from his and his colleagues\u2019 email servers. \u201cGo Fast\u201d shows a fighter pilot\u2019s encounter with a UAP.\n\nShellenberger will detail his reporting on the alleged \u201cImmaculate Constellation\u201d secret government program. A whistleblower revealed the alleged UFO program, in which the Pentagon collects and quarantines information on UFO sightings, Shellenberger says.\n\nDepartment of Defense spokesperson Sue Gough has previously denied records of the program.\n\nThe \u2018tic tac\u2019 incident: What we know about the UFO encounter\n\nShellenberger will highlight the need for Congress and the White House to address UFOs.\n\nMichael Gold, a former NASA administrator, will outline new ways for NASA to be helpful on the UAP issue. Currently Chief Growth Office at Redwire Space, Gold stresses in his testimony that he is speaking on his own behalf, and not for any other organization.\n\n\u201cAgencies such as NASA have much to offer when it comes to understanding UAP,\u201d Gold\u2019s prepared testimony reads.\n\nUFO Whistleblower Sparks Conversation\n\nMuch of the current conversation surrounding UFOs started when Grusch came forward last year with his claims that the government was operating a secret program dedicated to retrieving crashed UAPs and was in possession of nonhuman craft and biological remains of nonhuman beings.\n\nThe Defense Department has denied these allegations.\n\nStill, they sparked the 2023 congressional hearing on the subject \u2014 the first in more than 50 years \u2014where Grusch testified with former Navy pilot Ryan Graves and Navy Commander David Fravor.\n\nFravor talked about his experience encountering a UAP. Both Graves and Fravor said they were concerned about the risks UAPs pose to the military, regardless of origin.\n\nNetflix faces lawsuit over \u2018The Manhattan Alien Abduction\u2019\n\nLawmakers asked about the secret program referenced by Grusch, and eventually, the hearing led to the formation of a bipartisan UFO Caucus, informally led by Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\nAn official report issued by the Pentagon from the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office found no evidence of a secret program. Furthermore, it said the government has no evidence that UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin. However, the Department of Defense did admit to a proposed program known as Kona Blue, which was developed to reverse-engineer any alien technology recovered by the government. This never got off the ground, the DOD said, as no such technology was ever located.\n\nNASA, in a report of its own, said there\u2019s no evidence for extraterrestrial contact with Earth, though the agency said there needs to be more rigorous research in the area and less stigma around the topic as a whole.\n\nNewsNation digital producer Steph Whiteside contributed to this article.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "article_content": "Watch live! 2nd UFO hearing held by US congress, witnesses include fmr. miltary - YouTube Watch On\n\nThe U.S. government is holding another hearing on UFOs today, and you can watch it live.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representative's Committee on Oversight and Accountability will administer the hearing, titled \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\" The name of the event refers to UFOs by their new preferred acronym, which is more inclusive of sightings that might take place not only in the air but also in space, as well as those that take place across multiple domains.\n\nThe hearing will be held at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington D.C. at 11:30 a.m. ET (1630 GMT) on Wednesday (Nov. 13). You can watch it live here on Space.com, courtesy of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.\n\nThis marks the second congressional hearing U.S. Congress has put together in order to \"further pull back the curtain on secret UAP research programs conducted by the U.S. government, and undisclosed findings they have yielded,\" according to a House statement. The hearing will examine the U.S. Department of Defense's strict classification policies when it comes to UAP and related topics, and will explore ways to \"make sure the American public is better informed on this topic.\"\n\nThis will be a joint hearing, led by representatives Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) and Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), who argue that \"the American people are tired of the obfuscation and refusal to release information by the federal government,\" according to the House's statement.\n\n\"Americans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose. We can only ensure that understanding by providing consistent, systemic transparency. We look forward to hearing from expert witnesses on ways to shed more light and bring greater accountability to this issue,\" Mace and Grothman said in the statement.\n\nExpert witnesses in the hearing will include Luis Elizondo, a decorated former counterintelligence officer who has claimed for years that the U.S. government is hiding knowledge of UAP, including materials recovered from crashed flying saucers.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"The cover-up and disinformation campaign has been so successful that most scientists do not even know UAP are real,\" Elizondo wrote in his 2024 book \"Imminent.\" The book also claims that four \"deceased nonhuman bodies\" were recovered from the infamous 1947 crash in Roswell, New Mexico and that \"China and Russia do not have the same stigma and can employ their scientists to work on this topic for them.\"\n\nElizondo has also claimed firsthand knowledge of U.S. programs that employ individuals with psychic powers to \"remote view\" distant locations. Most recently, the former counterintelligence officer held a paid event where a photo was shown that Elizondo claimed was a \"real photo\" of a \"mothership\" UFO above a U.S. embassy. Within days, the photo was found to be the reflection of a lamp in a window.\n\nThe House hearing will also include Tim Gallaudet, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral who unidentified submersible objects, arguing that \"these underwater anomalies jeopardize US maritime security.\" Gallaudet has also told interviewers that his daughter is a \"medium\" who can communicate with spirits.\n\nOther speakers at the hearing include journalist Michael Shellenberger, who has also claimed the U.S. government is hiding UFO crash retrieval programs, and former NASA Associate Administrator of Space Policy and Partnerships Michael Gold, who is a member of NASA's independent UAP study team.\n\nAccording to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson's remarks in September 2024 when the team's report was released, \"the top takeaway from the study is that there is a lot more to learn.\"\n\n\"The NASA independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin, but we don't know what these UAP are,\" Nelson said."

The AI then fills in the empty space, making it look like the object was never there.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"With generative fill, you can make edits and additions with just a few words while maintaining the existing art style of your project. We are also introducing generative erase, a new AI-powered tool that helps you remove unwanted objects from the canvas, filling in the empty space left behind to make it look like the object was never there.\" said the product manager of the Windows Inbox Apps group, Dave Grochocki, reports Bleeping Computer.\n\nNotepad is also receiving an AI upgrade with the \"Rewrite\" feature, previously known as CoWriter. This tool allows users to rephrase sentences, adjust the tone of their text, and modify the content's length based on their preferences.\n\nThe Rewrite feature in Notepad is currently available in preview to Windows 11 users in select countries, including the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, and Germany. Users need to sign in with a Microsoft account to access this feature.\n\nIf the generative fill turns out to be as good as what Adobe has for Photoshop, it can be a real changer for Microsoft Paint. Maybe I'll start using it again after last using it in 5th grade."

I believe there are more things in this world that we don\u2019t understand, and I don\u2019t discount the possibility at all,\u201d said Fran Walters, who has lived next door for the last 28 years.\n\n\u201cWhen I first moved out here, I\u2019d walk by there and I could not believe there was a little girl playing in the front, and I remember thinking, \u2018How could a family with little kids buy this house?'\u201d she said.\n\n5 On Nov. 13, 1947, Ronald DeFeo, 23, walked through his Amityville home and executed his sleeping family Newsday via Getty Images\n\nThe house has long attracted curiosity seekers over its claims that it is haunted, but the legends began with a real-life crime on Nov. 13, 1974.\n\nAt around 3 a.m., 23-year-old Ronald \u201cButch\u201d DeFeo rose from bed with a .35 caliber rifle in his hands and executed his parents and four siblings as they slept.\n\nHe then got dressed, and went to work. It wasn\u2019t until hours later that DeFeo burst into a neighborhood bar and claimed somebody had attacked his family.\n\nThe next year DeFeo was sentenced to life in prison, but he spent his life blaming a long list of others \u2014 at one point reportedly claiming \u201cvoices\u201d coming from the house urged him to do it.\n\nThough DeFeo was believed to be a heavy drug user, famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren \u2014 who have since been fictionalized in \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d series of movies \u2014 came to believe he was performing satanic rituals, and those voices may have been demonic forces he unleashed on the house.\n\n5 DeFeo was sentenced to life in prison, and died in 2021 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\u201cDeFeo was into Satanism,\u201d said Tony Spera, the Warrens\u2019 son-in-law, who now leads the couple\u2019s New England Society of Psychic Research. \u201cHe had a little room they called the red room because it was painted red, and there\u2019s a little cubby hole and he kept his satanic artifacts in there.\n\n\u201cThings were happening in the home,\u201d Spera told The Post. \u201cSomething was going on in that house that was nefarious, and we believe it was Ronald DeFeo Jr. doing these satanic rituals.\u201d\n\nAs DeFeo was being sentenced, George and Kathy Lutz moved into the Amityville house with their three kids at a bargain price of $80,000.\n\nOver the next 28 days, the family claimed they were harassed by a host of terrifying happenings \u2014 including levitations and visions of hags, the children sleeping face-down just as the DeFeos bodies were found, freezing temperatures while fireplaces raged, and slime oozing from walls and doors.\n\n5 Tony Spera, the son-in-law of Ed and Lorraine Warren, cautioned that the Amityville house could still be haunted Matthew McDermott\n\nThey fled the home before the month was out, and after a local news station camped out at the house for a segment the Warrens showed up to investigate \u2014 but the Lutzes reportedly refused to go back inside with them.\n\n\u201cThere was an arrangement for George to meet Ed and Lorraine at a pizza place about five blocks away from the Amityville house,\u201d Spera recounted. \u201cEd said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s go to the house and check it out.\u2019\n\n\u201cGeorge stands up, pulls out the keys to the house. He goes, \u2018Here\u2019s the keys. I\u2019m not going in that house \u2026 I\u2019m not going anywhere near that house. Do me a favor, Ed, in such-and-such a drawer there\u2019s a deed to the house. Just get me that, will you?\u2019\u201d\n\nMonths later the Lutzes inked a book deal to tell their story, with \u201cThe Amityville Horror: A Story,\u201d which came out in 1977 and was an immediate success, sparking an even more successful film and sequels.\n\nThough many wrote it off as a hoax \u2014 DeFeo\u2019s own attorney, William Weber, later claimed he and the family concocted the story over several bottles of wine \u2014 the Lutz parents stood by their story for life.\n\n5 George and Kathy Lutz stood by their haunting story their entire lives Getty Images\n\nAnd while the house has changed hands numerous times since the Lutzes left, none of the owners have ever reported any hauntings over those five decades \u2014 something Spera thinks doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the Lutzes were lying, or that whatever haunted them is really gone.\n\n\u201cEd used to not want to talk very much about it, because he said the more recognition you give to it, the more likely something would happen. It depends on the entity, too, that might be at that house. It may lay dormant for years,\u201d Spera said.\n\n\u201cThere could possibly \u2014 and I\u2019m emphasizing the word possibly \u2014 still be something dormant in that structure that could reignite with either recognition, or somebody doing rituals in the house, incantations, or a family that is susceptible to hauntings \u2014 in other words, a family that\u2019s weak-willed, or someone in the house that\u2019s weak-willed.\n\n5 The Amityville house has changed hands numerous times since 1974, but nobody has reported a haunting since Getty Images\n\n\u201cSo in other words, I can move into a house. I can make it haunted. I can make the house haunted by dabbling in occult practices, by doing witchcraft, incantations, satanic rituals, using a Ouija board in the house,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhen you do things like that, you\u2019re inviting things into your life. You\u2019re inviting the unknown in.\u201d\n\nThe current residents of the house \u2013 along with one of the Lutz children \u2013 declined to comment.\n\nAs for Walters \u2014 who \u201cmade it a point to never ever, ever watch the movie\u201d \u2014 she\u2019s ventured inside the \u201cbeautiful\u201d home once during an estate sale, but wouldn\u2019t consider living there.\n\n\u201cIn the back of my head, the Amityville Horror would always be there. You\u2019d hear a little creak in the night and it might set you off. I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said."

Vendors outdid themselves and showcased their creativity by blending both of the seasons.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage Museum of Orange County has hosted the festival since it first began in 2022.\n\n\u201cFor those of us who live spooky all year long, which I do, it\u2019s great, big way for us to transition out of Halloween and into the holiday season,\u201d said Darcy Staniforth, the museum\u2019s paranormal coordinator. \u201cHistorically, people used to tell ghost stories at Christmas. A creepy event during the holiday season only makes sense.\u201d\n\nGhostface and Michael Myers cosplayers get into the Christmas spirit at Creep it Real Festive.

During Creep it Real Festive, she\u2019ll serve as the primary Haunted OC \u201cghost host\u201d for tours.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely haunted,\u201d she said. \u201cOn one of my last tours on Halloween, we all heard footsteps on the second floor as if someone was walking around in the attic \u2014 and no one was in the attic.\u201d\n\nMegan and Kevin Valantine are the duo behind Creep it Real Festive. (Rawl of the Dead / Courtesy of Creep it Real Festive)\n\nNearby, the museum\u2019s gazebo will serve as the focal point of festivities.

Ticket sales have already outsold last year\u2019s total attendance.\n\n\u201cIt has certainly gotten more successful with every passing year,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful way to meander around and enjoy the night.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit creepitrealoc.com."

        "date": "8h",
        "source": "Far Out Magazine",
        "article_content": "10 real-life destinations straight out of a Tim Burton movie\n\nFew directors working today have a visual style as distinctive as Tim Burton. The writer-director has been building gothically surreal and whimsically macabre worlds for decades, blending darkness, oddball energy, and the downright bizarre to create darkly funny, unmistakable movies for viewers of all ages.\n\nAlthough his feature debut was Pee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure in 1985, his true coming out as an auteur was 1988\u2019s Beetlejuice. Full of gallows humour, eccentric paranormal beings, and a truly surreal version of the afterlife, it set a high watermark for Burton\u2019s career and offered actors like Winona Ryder, Michael Keaton, and Catherine O\u2019Hara some of the most delightful roles of their careers.\n\nAlthough Burton\u2019s visual style is unmistakable, he\u2019s used it in a wide variety of settings. From mist-shrouded forests in Sleepy Hollow to the secluded castle in Edward Scissorhands and the wild skeleton party in Corpse Bride, he\u2019s found all the ways to make horror tropes as stylised and charming as possible.\n\nGiven their darkness, it might seem strange that anyone would want to live in or even visit the world of a Tim Burton film, but as any of his fans could tell you, there is more beauty, mystery, and quirkiness in that cloak of doom than you might imagine, and spending just a few moments in those fantastical settings would be worth a trip around the world.\n\nHighgate Cemetery, London\n\nA lot of business happens in the cemetery in Beetlejuice. It\u2019s where the freelance bio-exorcist of the title dwells, waiting for someone to call on him for assistance. And as a result, it\u2019s where Michael Keaton does the most\u2026 enthusiastic acting of his career. The graveyard may be nothing more than a model come to life, but the atmosphere is set by all those tombstones, even if they are made of cardboard. Then, there\u2019s Halloween Town in The Nightmare Before Christmas, which is full of sinister grey stones and curling mist.\n\nAny self-respecting Burton fan should make a trip to a graveyard, and few are as scenic as Highgate Cemetery in north London. Designed by architect Stephen Geary nearly two centuries ago, it is home to about 170,000 bodies and covers 15 hectares (37 acres). It features winding pathways lined with towering crypts, moss-covered gravestones, and almost certainly supernatural activity. It may not be the location of any of Burton\u2019s films, but it definitely feels like one.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Joanna Penn)\n\nHallstatt, Austria\n\nOne of Burton\u2019s favourite stylistic touchstones in the gothic period. Whether drawing on architecture or simply putting all his characters in dark eyeliner, he is committed to all things goth, in both the capitalised and lowercase sense of the word. Many of his settings also feature isolation, especially tall houses on hills above a town. This architecture gives his main characters an added element of loneliness. He loves characters who are ostracised, and putting them in whimsically haunted houses far away from civilization adds to their charm and moroseness.\n\nHallstatt in Austria is just such a place. Tucked away in Austria\u2019s mountainous Salzkammergut region, it sits on Lake Hallstatt and features 16th-century architecture that is both beautiful and haunting. With a population of less than 800 people, it feels cloistered and remote, just like the best of Burton\u2019s locales.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Free Walking Tour Salzburg)\n\nSedlec Ossuary, Czech Republic\n\nLet\u2019s not beat around the bush. Burton has a love of the macabre, specifically skeletons, so it stands to reason that you\u2019d need at least one travel destination that leads you to human bones. Under most circumstances, this sort of adventure could get you arrested, but not if you visit Sedlec Ossuary, a Roman Catholic chapel in Kutn\u00e1 Hora, Czech Republic.\n\nThe location began as a burial site around 1278. During the Black Plague, thousands of bodies were buried there, and when workers began to build a church on top of them in the 15th century, many of them were exhumed, and the bones were stacked in piles. Eventually, those bones were turned into art. There are garlands of skulls, a bone chandelier, and a general atmosphere of extreme eeriness. You can imagine Tim Burton feeling right at home.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Nan Palmero)\n\nHoia-Baciu Forest, Romania\n\nKnown as the most haunted forest in the world, the Hoia-Baciu Forest is located near the Transylvanian capital of Cluj-Napoca. It\u2019s only three square kilometres, but it has more than its fair share of legends, from classic ghost stories to modern claims of paranormal activity. Regardless of what you believe about the supernatural, the forest is full of tall, twisted trees that are often shrouded in mist.\n\nBurton has used shadowy woods in his movies, both animated and live-action. Like the misty forest in Corpse Bride or Western Woods in Sleepy Hollow, the Hoia-Baciu Forest gives the impression that those trees disappearing into the fog are hiding more than branches.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Cristian Bortes)\n\nOaxaca, Mexico\n\nIn Corpse Bride, Victor accidentally makes a young dead woman believe he has married her, and she takes him down to the world of the deceased. There, they visit the Ball and Socket Pub and are serenaded by Bonejangles and his band, who tell her story through song.\n\nThe upbeat nature of the music is wonderfully out of sync with the macabre setting, but Burton didn\u2019t invent the idea of colourful, joyous depictions of death. In Mexico, Dia de los Muertos is a days-long holiday honouring loved ones who have died. Instead of being a sombre occasion, it is full of colour, music, and ecstatic pageantry. Decorative skulls are everywhere, and people paint their faces to look like skeletons and erect shrines covered in bright orange marigolds to celebrate those who have passed. In the city of Oaxaca, Dia de los Muertos is as vibrant and busy as Carnival in Rio. Full of colour and dancing, it\u2019s like a bigger, more joyful, citywide version of the Ball and Socket Pub in Burton\u2019s stop-motion classic.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Cidades para Pessoas)\n\nNeuschwanstein Castle, Germany\n\nChilly mansions situated far from the cosy streets of civilization is one of Burton\u2019s most common tropes. Often, these buildings aren\u2019t haunted; they\u2019re just a metaphor for the isolation of his characters. Edward Scissorhands is the primary example. Sweet and innocent, he becomes a curiosity when he is brought down to suburbia, but being different has tragic consequences in a world of conformity.\n\nNeuschwanstein Castle in Germany is known for being the inspiration behind the Disneyland castle that appears before all the studio\u2019s movies, but one look at the real castle, and you\u2019ll see that there is nothing twee or sweetly fantastical about it. Located on a steep section of the foothills of the Alps, it appears chilly and inaccessible, exactly the sort of place where characters like Edward Scissorhands are banished.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Thomas Wolf)\n\nAshikaga Flower Park, Tochigi, Japan\n\nOne of the most gorgeously surreal destinations to visit is the Ashikaga Flower Park in Tochigi, Japan. Bursting with carefully manicured gardens featuring flowers of all shapes and colours, it looks fantastical and otherworldly. One part of the park features a ceiling of dangling purple wisteria blossoms, and at night, LED lights illuminate sections of the gardens with even more colours.\n\nIf Burton had been looking for real-world settings for Alice in Wonderland instead of relying so heavily on CGI, he could have done worse than get a filming permit for the Ashikaga Flower Park. Short of that, we can all aspire to visit the real location.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Hiroaki Kaneko)\n\nLa Petite Venise, Colmar, France\n\nIn the northeastern French city of Colmar, there is a historical neighbourhood called La Petite Venise that features colourful Alsatian half-timbered houses lining a canal. The Alsace region is close to Germany and Switzerland, giving it a distinct style of architecture that isn\u2019t governed by a single national identity.\n\nWith their steeply pitched roofs, stepped gables, and pastel walls, the houses look like they belong in any number of Burton films. The colours are reminiscent of his stylized version of suburbia in Edward Scissorhands, while their half-timbered facades are reminiscent of the Dutch houses in Sleepy Hollow. You could even imagine Bonejangles bursting out of the Ball and Socket Pub to play jazz in the streets.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Infrogmation of New Orleans)\n\nThe Dark Hedges, Northern Ireland\n\nOne of the most distinctive elements of Sleepy Hollow is the Western Woods, the misty forest where the Headless Horseman was murdered and the Crone Witch lives in a hollow. It is full of atmosphere \u2013 trees with twisted branches, leaves covering the ground, and fog so thick you can only see the spectral outlines of limbs.\n\nThe world of the film takes place in Upstate New York, but if you want to visit a group of trees that is at least as atmospheric as the one in the movie, you need to visit the Dark Hedges in Northern Ireland. Although they only form an avenue along a road rather than a forest, their undulating shape and towering height feel completely immersive. The trees may not bleed like the Tree of the Dead, but when they\u2019re shrouded in mist, they seem just as supernatural. Not surprisingly, they have already been a boon for filmmakers, specifically for the crew behind Game of Thrones.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Colin Park)\n\nPark G\u00fcell, Barcelona\n\nBurton\u2019s more recent forays into colourful, psychedelic fantasy may not be nearly up to the cinematic calibre of his earlier work, but they can\u2019t be accused of lacking style. If you\u2019re looking for a place that mimics the garish, surreal worlds of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Alice in Wonderland, Park G\u00fcell in Barcelona is a close approximation.\n\nDesigned by pioneering Modernist architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, the park is famous for its colourful mosaics, rounded edges, and geometric shapes. Walking through it feels like stepping into another world, just like Charlie and Alice do in their respective movies.\n\n(Credits: Far Out / Bernard Gagnon)"

        "article_content": "David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson acknowledged there was \"a lot of tension\" between them on \"The X-Files\" that resulted in the co-stars not speaking for weeks off camera while working on the hit show.\n\nAnderson, 56, spoke to Duchovny, 64, on the Nov. 12 episode of his \"Fail Better\" podcast, with the two revisiting their time together on the hit Fox show that ran from 1993-2002, spawned two movies, and revivals in 2016 and 2018. Duchovny played FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder, and Anderson played his partner, Special Agent Dana Scully, in the science fiction series about unsolved cases involving the paranormal.\n\nAnderson said she came on Duchovny's podcast to have \"a conversation that I don't feel like we ever had,\" which led to him reflecting on shooting the show together during the height of its popularity in the '90s.\n\nDavid Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in the 2008 movie \"The X Files: I Want to Believe.\"\n\n\"The part of this conversation that is the trickiest part for me is, I guess I would talk about like my failure of friendship, or my failure of companionship,\" Duchovny said.\n\n\"There was a long time working on the show where we were just not even dealing with one another off camera,\" he added. \"And there was a lot of tension, which didn\u2019t matter, apparently, for the work, because we\u2019re both f------ crazy, I guess, that we could just go out there and do what we needed to do.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s crazy that we were able to present on camera the various feelings and emotions and attraction and all that kind of stuff, but then not speak to each other for weeks at a time or whatever,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know, but I could have handled myself better,\" Duchovny said.\n\nDavid Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in 1998.\n\nDuchovny also opened up about leaving the show in the early 2000s and his emotions after Anderson left \"The X-Files\" following its revival in 2018.\n\n\"I never apologized to you for that,\" he told Anderson about his original departure from the show. \"I don\u2019t know that I even talked to you about it, and then you said you weren\u2019t going to do the show anymore, like, the last time we did it (in 2018). And I know that hurt my feelings.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't know,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"I get it, you know, like, OK, and I support it, whatever it is you want to do, but I was like, 'Oh, she\u2019s quitting me,' you know?\" Duchovny said. \"She doesn\u2019t like working with me anymore. It was like, that little kid inside is going, 'Hey!' And then I was like, but I didn\u2019t say anything to her back in the day.\"\n\nLater in their conversation, Anderson returned to the moment Duchovny left in 2001.\n\n\"We never talked about it,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t think I ever blamed you. ... I don\u2019t think I blamed you at all. I don\u2019t think I was upset.\"\n\n\"Well, thanks a lot,\" Duchovny said.\n\nAfter Duchovny departed, Anderson considered following him out the door.\n\n\"There was a point, I mean, for me at that time, it was, 'Can I too?'\" she said. \"At first I thought, 'Well, then we\u2019re both going to because clearly I can\u2019t go on without him, so surely I\u2019ll be able to.' And then they started talking about, 'Well, if you stay on, you can actually make some good money.'\"\n\nDuchovny also recalled a \"dysfunctional\" moment between the two in the midst of their stardom on the show.\n\n\"It was some Emmys, and it was the day after, and I had a private plane, and I was giving you a ride,\" he said. \"And you were late, and I was so angry. And then we sat on this private plane, flying to Vancouver from LA, not talking.\n\n\"And you wrote me a letter,\" he continued. \"So you\u2019re just like 6 feet away from me, writing a letter to me, and it\u2019s a beautiful letter. I don\u2019t remember it exactly, but it was appreciative, and it was like it was all the things that I wanted to hear. But it\u2019s just amazing that we couldn\u2019t just have that conversation. The fact that it\u2019s a private plane, it\u2019s just all ridiculous.\"\n\n\"I had no memory that we were even on a private plane together, let alone, yeah, I wrote you a letter on one,\" Anderson said. \"Interesting.\"\n\nDuchovny also remembered a moment with \"The X-Files\" creator Chris Carter amid some tension in the first season.\n\n\"I think we were kind of butting heads so early on in the first season that Chris asked us if we would go into fake couples (therapy). Like, would we go into TV character couple therapy? I remember sitting in his office with you, and Chris is like, 'Yeah, do you guys want to go into therapy.' And I was like, 'You mean as Mulder and Scully?' I\u2019m confused. I remember that.\"\n\nAnother source of strife came in 2016 when Anderson fought for pay equity with Duchovny for the revival of the show. She told The Daily Beast at the time that she was only offered half the salary of Duchovny for the 2016 return and had spent three years during the original run of \"The X-Files\" trying to achieve pay equity with her co-star.\n\nDavid Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in the later years of \"The X-Files.\"\n\n\"That whole pay equity thing, that\u2019s in our past as well,\" Duchovny said. \"I was part of that.\n\n\"Selfishly, back then, I thought I was like being attacked,\" he continued. \"I thought, 'Oh, I\u2019m being attacked for being offered more money.'\"\n\n\"Attacked by who?\" Anderson asked.\n\n\"The world,\" Duchovny said.\n\n\"What, that they blamed you in some way?\" Anderson said.\n\n\"In a way,\" Duchovny said.\n\n\"Oh really, I didn\u2019t know that,\" Anderson said. \"I'm sorry. That's interesting that I wasn't paying attention to that side of it.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't make you pay attention to it,\" Duchovny said.\n\nDuring their talk, the two also delved into Anderson's childhood and latest ventures, including her new book, \"Want,\" a collection of anonymous sexual fantasies submitted by women from around the world.\n\nThis article was originally published on TODAY.com"

        "article_content": "Some of the victims of the Mount Vesuvius eruption in 79 A.D. in Pompeii were cast in plaster to preserve the scene.\n\nNew DNA studies of those victims tell a different tale than what experts had previously speculated.\n\nCommon interpretations of three well-known relationships were proven false by the scientific study.\n\nThe Mount Vesuvius eruption of 79 A.D. blanketed Pompeii in destruction. To preserve the historical nature of the event and help tell the stories of the residents of the city, some of the victims who had been buried by the ash and debris from the volcano were eventually cast in plaster. It turns out that the stories of a few of those individuals weren\u2019t quite as truthful as we previously thought.\n\nA new study\u2014published in Current Biology by a team of researchers at Harvard University and the Archaeological Park of Pompeii in Naples, Italy\u2014asserts that ancient DNA taken from some of the victims challenges stories long told about those particular Pompeii citizens.\n\n\u201cThe findings demonstrate the importance of integrating genetic analysis with archaeological and historical information to enrich or correct narratives constructed based on limited evidence,\u201d Alissa Mittnik, a co-author of the study, said in a statement.\n\nRelated Story Roman Coins, Graves Found in Pompeii Shop Dig\n\nFor decades, many of the stories told about the relationships and connections between individuals discovered within the Archaeological Park of Pompeii were based simply on the physical appearances of the victims and their proximity to one another. In one situation, for example, the tableau of an adult with a golden bracelet holding a child on their lap was interpreted as a mother holding her offspring. This recent DNA analysis, however, shows that there was no maternal presence or any familial relationship involved in the scene. Instead, the adult in the scene wearing the jewelry was a male who was biologically unrelated to the child.\n\nA second scene features four victims huddled together, often believed to be a family. But when the research team analyzed DNA from three of the victims, they found no genetic ties between them.\n\nIn a third situation, two individuals are seen lying in what is believed to be an embrace. Some have hypothesized the two people could be sisters, a mother holding a daughter, or even lovers. The DNA shows that at least one of the two people was a male, eliminating two of the three common interpretations.\n\nThe ancient eruption buried several Roman towns, killing inhabitants and laying ash deposits across cities that preserved everything from buildings to sculptures and mosaics to human victims. Shortly following the eruption, rain helped functionally cement the bodies within the ash. When excavators descended upon the area centuries later, the outlines of roughly 1,000 victims remained and\u2014in over 100 cases\u2014the cavities were filled in with plaster to preserve their positioning.\n\nRelated Story Before Volcanoes, Pompeii Struggled with Potholes\n\nWhile this DNA analysis dispels some of the myths of Pompeii, the goal of the team behind this work was not necessarily to sleuth out any definitive histories. And DNA on its own wouldn\u2019t be enough to know the stories of these victims. For one, some of the remains may have been moved from their original positions, and the plaster casts could have been \u201ccreatively restored\u201d in the past, the study authors wrote. The team also warned that using so few clues, such as jewelry, to spin a full tale proves risky, especially in an area rich with differing cultures.\n\nThe intent of the team was never to get these stories right once and for all\u2014rather, they wanted to ensure that the tales were merely less wrong. \u201cInstead of establishing new narratives that might also misrepresent these people\u2019s experiences,\u201d David Reich, co-senior author of the study, said in a statement, \u201cthe genetic results encourage reflection on the dangers of making up stories about gender and family relationships in past societies based on present-day expectations.\u201d"

(NASDAQ: BIDU and HKEX: 9888), a leading AI company with strong Internet foundation, today hosted its annual flagship technology conference Baidu World 2024 in Shanghai. At the event, the company announced a range of new AI technologies and solutions to accelerate the boom of AI applications, featuring iRAG (Image-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a new technology designed to tackle hallucinations in image generation, and Miaoda, a no-code tool that empowers businesses and individuals to create applications.\n\nThe launch comes amid surging demand for Baidu's AI offerings, as evidenced by the ERNIE foundation model's daily API calls reaching 1.5 billion by early November. This represents a substantial 30-fold increase from the 50 million announced a year ago.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nERNIE's daily API calls reach 1.5 billion by early November 2024 Advertisement\n\nRobin Li\n\nChina\n\n\"The growth rate exceeded my expectations,\" said, Co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Baidu, who described the steep increase as a reflection of the explosive growth in generative AI applications inover the past two years.\n\nRobin Li, Co-founder, Chairman, and CEO of Baidu, speaks at Baidu World 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking ahead, Li emphasized that agents will serve as the predominant form of AI applications and are approaching a tipping point of explosive growth. Underscoring this point, Li introduced the Top 100 Agents and Top 100 Industry Applications on the ERNIE AgentBuilder platform.\n\nBaidu World 2024 also highlighted the latest user growth for ERNIE Bot, ERNIE's expanding role in enterprise applications, and featured the debut of Xiaodu AI Glasses by Xiaodu Technology.\n\nNew iRAG Technology to Mitigate Hallucinations in Image Generation\n\nHallucinations, a phenomenon in which AI generates false or misleading information, have remained one of the most intractable barriers to the widespread adoption of generative AI. In text generation, RAG technology has largely resolved the problem of hallucinations, greatly enhancing the accuracy of generated answers. However, in the field of multimodality, hallucinations remain a key obstacle, often manifesting as inaccurate depictions of people or landmarks.\n\nBaidu's newly launched iRAG technology can mitigate hallucinations in text-to-image generation. Leveraging Baidu Search's vast collection of hundreds of millions of images and the company's strong foundation model capabilities, the new technology enables text-to-image models to deliver hyper-realistic visuals while also significantly reducing the cost of image production. The ability of the iRAG to reduce hallucinations boosts the applicability of images generated by text-to-image models across visual mediums, including comics, storyboards, posters, among others. Li described the reduction of hallucinations as laying the groundwork for the coming boom in AI applications.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiaoda: Building Applications with Natural Language\n\nBaidu also unveiled Miaoda, a no-code tool that makes it possible to build entire applications simply by describing them in natural language. Miaoda provides no-code programming, multi-agent collaboration, and multi-tool invocation. No-code programming allows anyone to generate code without writing a single line, lowering barriers to AI development and making it accessible to all. Its multi-agent collaboration leverages ERNIE's thinking and planning capabilities to coordinate and manage different agents effectively, while its multi-tool invocation taps into ERNIE's tool invocation abilities, extensively utilizing web search, iRAG, maps API, and other tools for a seamless workflow.\n\n\"Baidu isn't aiming to launch a 'super app'; instead, we aim to help more people and businesses create millions of 'super useful' applications,\" Li said.\n\nMirroring the real-world product development process, Miaoda draws on the abilities of different agents across multiple domains such as project management and planning, content editing, programming and quality control. Miaoda can even automatically identify bugs and use a range of tools. Li called it \"the most complex application case of multi-agent collaboration to date\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiaoda empowers everyone with the capabilities of a programmer - anyone who can speak, can create applications, greatly enhancing human productivity.\n\nAgents as the Next Frontier in AI Application\n\n\"Today, while all leading global tech firms are paying attention to agents, few have made them as central to their strategy as Baidu has,\" Li said at the event. He likened the potential of agents to websites in the PC era and social media accounts in the mobile age.\n\n\"Agents are more human-like, more intelligent, and act like your sales, customer service representatives, or assistants. Agents will become a new vehicle for content, information and services,\" Li added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour types of agents - company, character, tool, and industry - were highlighted at the event to demonstrate the potential of agents in the AI era. Company agents, for example, differ from traditional websites that only show static company and product information, and can instead proactively recommend products based on customer needs and respond promptly to service requests, greatly improving the efficiency of interactive marketing. After deploying an agent powered by ERNIE, automaker BYD saw a 119% increase in lead conversion.\n\nLi also offered the example of the tool agent Free Canvas, developed in collaboration between Baidu Wenku and Baidu Drive. It allows users to drag and drop documents, audio, video, and other materials onto a canvas-like interface to quickly generate multimodal content. Similarly, the industry agent Faxingbao was specifically developed for the legal field. It has answered over 16.6 million legal questions and can also calculate compensation, draft legal documents, and recommend suitable lawyers.\n\nTo date, Baidu's ERNIE AgentBuilder has garnered the interest of 150,000 businesses and 800,000 developers. The top 100 agents encompass character-based agents like the \"Farmer Academician\", as well as agents for tools, industries, workplace, emotions, and entertainment.\n\nExpanding ERNIE's Reach with Growing Developer Community, Enterprise Applications and AI Glasses\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaifeng Wang, Chief Technology Officer of Baidu, announced that ERNIE Bot has amassed 430 million users, while the PaddlePaddle deep learning platform and ERNIE have a total of 18.08 million developers. Wang also mentioned that the ERNIE foundation model is still in training, with an even more powerful version worth looking forward to.\n\nDou Shen, Executive Vice President of Baidu and President of Baidu AI Cloud Group, highlighted that the Qianfan platform has helped customers fine-tune 33,000 models, and develop 770,000 enterprise applications. Shen noted that the explosion in new AI applications has begun on the enterprise front, supported by a new AI infrastructure comprising an enterprise-level foundation model engineering platform and a heterogeneous computing platform, poised to replace traditional cloud computing.\n\nYing Li, CEO of Xiaodu Technology, introduced Xiaodu AI Glasses, the first native AI glasses powered by a Chinese language foundation model. Powered by ERNIE and equipped with visual, audio, and location-based capabilities, these smart glasses serve as a versatile AI assistant across everyday scenarios. They function as a personal tour guide, offer information via Baidu Maps and Search, and excel in instant translation and content summarization from photos. Ideal for both academics and casual readers, they also assist with intelligent note-taking and can personalize music to enhance the user's surroundings. Li revealed that Xiaodu AI Glasses will be available for sale in the first half of 2025.\n\nAbout Baidu\n\nFounded in 2000, Baidu's mission is to make the complicated world simpler through technology. Baidu is a leading AI company with strong internet foundation, trading on the NASDAQ under \"BIDU\" and HKEX under \"9888.\" One Baidu ADS represents eight Class A ordinary shares.\n\nMedia Contact\n\n[email protected]"

        "article_content": "Eran Zinman\n\nA significant milestone for monday.com, the workforce management software provider, as it hits annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $1 billion. From a product offering perspective, traction continues to build across the company\u2019s target markets of work management, CRM, service management and software development, including its Monday AI no code offering. Of the last of these, co-CEO Eran Zinman pitches:\n\nWe are excited to report initial strong adoption with a remarkable 150% increase in the use of AI blocks since Q2. Looking ahead, monday AI will be integrated throughout our entire product suite, enhancing functionality across the platform\u2026In terms of total AI actions, it grew for more than 250% compared to Q2. And the AI blocks grew 150% from Q2. So overall, we see more and more customers adopt those blocks, people incorporate them into their automation. They create a lot of processes within the product that involves AI within that. And over time, we are planning to roll out the monetization tied with AI, where we're going to generate clear and efficient value for our customers. So definitely, we're very happy to see the progress with the AI features, the adoption of AI features. And over time, we've got the ability to monetize that as well.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a 'show me the money' Wall Street short termist, when will that monetization be seen? Well:\n\nWe don't have a specific date, but it might be in 2025. But we can't commit to that.\n\nMeanwhile monday Work Management continues to gain significant traction with enterprise customers, says Zinman:\n\nIn Q3, our second largest customer, increased their seat count from 25,000 to 6,000 as part of their initiative to simplify and consolidate the technology stack. This represents a remarkable 24 fold increase in the receipt count since 2022\u2026Until recently they had 25,000 seats, now we have this additional upgrade. What basically happened is they got more departments using the product across the team. We now have departments from consulting, infrastructure, finance, operations, and also the sales team. So all-in-all it's become a very significant tool within the company and also more room to grow. The feedback is great.\n\nService\n\nComing up is monday Service, currently in beta and on track for release at the end of the calendar year. This will be a significant addition to the monday arsenal, Zinman explains:\n\nWe're very excited about monday Service. It feels like there's a huge opportunity there, especially cross-selling that product to existing customers. Because of that and because we see them and also from our larger customers, we just want to make sure that, one, the product is mature enough so that it can scale within our existing customers, not just the smaller ones but also the mid-market enterprise customers. And then there's a bunch of features that we're planning to finalize before the official launch. One of them is the customer portal where people can create tickets, and also some AI functionality that we added into the product. We feel that we're pretty close to launching the full release of that product. The feedback from customers is very good, so overall, we're very excited. There seems to be strong demand in terms of go-to market, and also a great reception from customers who already use the product.\n\nHe adds:\n\nWhat we\u2019ve seen currently from use cases that we have, we see IT service, but we see a lot of ticketing around HR, around operations, all the way to finance, marketing teams and customer support, internal customer support ticketing. Currently, we don\u2019t plan to position monday Service as outside facing support platform, but mostly within the company. But given the current use cases, it\u2019s very broad across the company, not just for IT, but across almost any department.\n\nExpanding\n\nThe company is expanding its headcount, up 194 people to 2,305 in the past three months - and more to come, said Zinman:\n\nThe fact that we hire more salespeople is basically because we see a lot of demand and a lot of opportunity within our own customer base. So it makes sense building towards growth for 2025. So we're pretty confident on that and our plans for 2025 as well. And again, like, as we grow more revenues coming from existing customers as they upgrade buying more products and adding more seats, but our acquisition engine and bringing the customers remains a very strong part of the business. And we're investing a lot into that and growing that as well.\n\nHe adds:\n\nThe way our sales organization is built is that we have different teams that focus on different go-to-market, meaning, SMB, mid-market and enterprise customers. And then within each one of those segments, we have the AEs (Account Executives) and AMs (Account Managers). AEs focus on acquiring and converting new businesses that sign up or have interest in using platforms, and AMs, which is the most significant part of our sale organization, are focused on expanding the customers. What they usually do is either expand an existing use case or find new buyers within the organization to sell them additional use cases or additional products. We're planning to scale that \u2026I think this also presents an opportunity. We're also going up-market and definitely opportunity to expand that motion. We're going to bring more seasoned sales reps and perhaps leadership that have expertise in getting into the enterprise segment as well. So all-in-all, this is how the team is built, and we're planning to scale that and invest more heavily into larger accounts.\n\nPricing will play a part here, of course. Earlier this year monday introduced new pricing for both new customers and for existing customers on renewal. This new structure for the core Work Management platform saw a 12.5% increase for Basic, a 20% increase for the popular Standard tier, and an 18.8% increase for Pro with the impact on the Enterprise tier not disclosed. According to Zinman, these changes are going well:\n\nThe new pricing remains on target to be fully rolled out by July of 2025, so we're still kind of in the middle of the process. So far, it's been rolled out to about 50% of our customers. We see about $30 million impact for fiscal 2024 and total impact from the price increase will be about $80 million between fiscal '24 and fiscal year '26. So those are kind of the updated figures. But just to give you some more color, we are going really well with the price increase, reception from customers is good. We don't see any kind of negative feedback. So we continue to roll out the pricing as we planned.\n\nBut he does concede:\n\nWe do see a little bit less customer adds, but that's part of our price increase and part of our strategy that we focus not just on SMBs but also on large enterprises.\n\nMy take\n\nWith a presumed addressable market of around $100 billion, for ZInman\u2019s co-CEO Roy Mann, all of this is part of a longer journey.\n\nAs the landscape of work evolves, we are determined to stay ahead of the curve by continuously investing in technology, exploring new markets, and fostering a culture of agility. monday.com is not just keeping pace with the industry, we are shaping its future.\n\nOne to keep a close eye on in 2025."

        "article_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nGlobal levels of planet-heating pollution from fossil fuels will hit record levels this year, according to new projections, dashing hopes 2024 would be the year they plateau or fall.\n\nFossil fuel pollution is set to rise to 37.4 billion metric tons this year, an increase of 0.8% from 2023, a report found. Global emissions from coal, oil and gas are all projected to increase.\n\nThe news comes as global leaders gather at the COP29 UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan \u2014 talks which have been overshadowed by anxiety over what a new Trump administration will mean for global climate action. The urgency is clear, however, this year is \u201cvirtually certain\u201d to be the hottest on record, and has seen back-to-back hurricanes, catastrophic flooding, devastating typhoons and severe drought.\n\n\u201cThe impacts of climate change are becoming increasingly dramatic, yet we still see no sign that burning of fossil fuels has peaked,\u201d said Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate professor at the University of Exeter, who led the study, published Tuesday by the Global Carbon Project, a consortium of scientists.\n\nWhile fossil fuels make up the bulk of planet-heating pollution, the other main source is land-use change, including deforestation. Those emissions are also set to go up in 2024, according to the report, exacerbated by this year\u2019s severe droughts and fires.\n\nThere was some more positive news: emissions are set to decline in the US and Europe, and China\u2019s emissions are slowing, and could even see a decline this year, the research projected. But that progress is offset by increases in much of the rest of the world, including India.\n\nTotal global climate pollution will reach 41.6 billion metric tons this year, up from 40.6 billion metric tons last year, according to the report.\n\nThe increase may not seem huge, but it puts the world way off track for tackling the climate crisis.\n\nA UN report published in October said global carbon emissions were slowly plateauing and had raised the possibility they could fall this year.\n\nFossil fuel pollution needs to roughly halve over this decade to keep global warming lower than 1.5 degrees Celsius, a threshold countries have pledged to try to stay below in the Paris climate agreement.\n\nClimate change is already having catastrophic impacts. But scientists warn that at 1.5 degrees, it begins to exceed the ability of humans and the natural world to adapt \u2014 including potentially triggering devastating climate tipping points.\n\nHumanity has already lived through 12-month periods above this critical climate limit but scientists are more concerned about longer timeframes. Tuesday\u2019s study estimates that at current rates of emissions, there is a 50% chance the world will breach 1.5 degrees consistently in about six years.\n\nSome companies and governments have emphasized carbon removal as a key way to bring global temperatures down, but current technology is only removing around one-millionth of the carbon pollution produced by fossil fuels, the report found.\n\n\u201cTime is running out,\u201d Friedlingstein said, adding, \u201cworld leaders meeting at COP29 must bring about rapid and deep cuts to fossil fuel emissions.\u201d"

Most were simple security updates, while others included new features and OS upgrades. Fans expected an update in October, but Google delayed it until this month. This update will resume the rollout of Wear OS 5 to Pixel Watch 1 and Pixel Watch 2 users after a series of crashes caused Google to pause it back in September. After several months of work, the company has addressed the cause of the crashes and is confident that yesterday\u2019s update will be stable.\n\nIn addition to Wear OS 5, the update will also include better camera controls and changes to the Pixel Recorder app, which will be available through the Play Store. Your individual watch will notify you when the update is available for download, so you don\u2019t have to constantly check for it. The first update for the Pixel Watch 3 since its launch is also coming with bug fixes and security updates. All Pixel Watch models will eventually update to version AW2A.241105.012, although when the update happens will depend on both the carrier and the device.\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019re going to have to wait a while for the next Pixel Watch software updates, which Google says won\u2019t come until March 2025. Before now, Pixel Watch users have never before seen a three-month gap in updates. The longest time between updates usually coincided with operating system upgrades, such as from Wear OS 3 to Wear OS 4. That said, slower updates aren\u2019t necessarily a downside. By reducing the time spent on deploying bug fixes, Google could potentially focus on releasing regular, larger updates \u2014 maybe quarterly versus monthly.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile the wait is unfortunate, it does have a gleaming silver lining. The schedule for the next update lines up with a March Feature Drop. You can expect some significant upgrades and improvements, along with a few updates we already know are coming like the Android 15 QPR2 beta. Expect to see changes not only in how the Pixel Watch works, but also in how it interacts with Android. It\u2019s also safe to say that there are likely several surprises we haven\u2019t come across yet."

The name of the game for global automakers has been to transition toward producing \u201csoftware-defined vehicles\u201d (SDVs), with functionalities and digital experiences that can be upgraded over time.\n\nThe companies plan to use Rivian\u2019s electrical architecture and software technology stack to enable the launch of Rivian\u2019s R2 midsize SUV in the first half of 2026 and support the launch of Volkswagen models by 2027.\n\nSpeaking during a conference call, Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume said the next-gen platform will first be deployed for Volkswagen brand vehicles, followed by Audi, Scout, Porsche and all remaining brands.\n\nThe venture and the injection of capital from Volkswagen should also provide much needed support for Rivian, which has struggled with suppy issues this year.\n\nIn August, the EV maker had to temporarily suspend the production of delivery vans used by Amazon.com due to a shortage of parts. Amazon remains the largest investor in Rivian, with a 16% stake."
