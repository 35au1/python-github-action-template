        "article_content": "Game Theory: UFO 50 is a massive trove of twists on old-school gaming genius Scroll until you find a title that sounds cool; you may hit something that'll be one of your favorite games of 2024.\n\nWhen approaching a video game project like Mossmouth\u2019s new release UFO 50\u2014an absolutely massive labor of love that is brilliant, frustrating, fun, mysterious, artistically ambitious, and sometimes just really fucking frustrating\u2014it helps to start from base principles. So: UFO 50, released on Steam this week, is a collection of 50 games of varying length and complexity, all purportedly from a fictional 1980s video game developer called UFOSoft. The games in the collection, which are presented in a fake chronological order built around the loosely sketched history of the company, largely draw their inspirations from the library of the Nintendo Entertainment System; amidst more esoteric or complicated pastiches, you can find games that serve as fairly straight homages to River City Rampage, Uninvited, Solar Jetman, Dragon Quest, and many more. There are meta elements operating to the side of the main draw\u2014notes on the games\u2019 fake development, a terminal that lets you go digging for secrets, markers that indicate when you\u2019ve completed individual titles\u2014but the focus has clearly been put on the games themselves, which were developed (in our world) by the Mossmouth team, including Spelunky creator Derek Yu.\n\nThe obvious comparison point for all this, at least for nerds of a certain vintage, will be clear: Cult Nintendo DS title Retro Game Challenge (and its sadly never-exported-from-Japan sequel), which pulled this same basic \u201cfake games from fake consoles from a fake past\u201d conceit back in 2007. Players who come to UFO 50 looking for a direct recreation of that experience might come away a little disappointed, though: Where that game prided itself on building up the fiction surrounding its faux games, complete with fake manuals and fake magazines for players to peruse in between playing its riffs on Mario or Galaga, UFO 50 is a bit more barebones in its presentation. (You get a few sentences of notes per game, and that\u2019s about it.) Given a choice between putting their emphasis on the games, or on the materials surrounding them, the small Mossmouth team understandably focused on function over form; we might wish for a more lush package, but it honestly feels churlish to complain, when the actual content of the collection is far more expansive than we\u2019ve had time to even come close to coming to terms with.\n\nAs to that content: We wish we could declare each of UFO 50\u2032s 50 games a retro-indie masterpiece, each one preserving what worked from classic game design while jettisoning the chaff, but, uh\u2026 No. Don\u2019t get us wrong: There are extremely good games in here, some more than worth the collection\u2019s $25 asking price all on their own. (We have lost too many hours this past week already to arena shooter Overbold, or mechanically gorgeous dungeon crawler Valbrace.) But many of the games in the collection feel torn between their desire to stay true to the clunky, frequently unfair controls of console ages past, and being genuinely fun games. Yes, it feels authentic that Barbuta, the very first game in the collection, happily wipes your progress every time you lose all your lives, erasing what could be 20 minutes of very fussy trap and dungeon navigation. Whether it\u2019s fun is a much thornier question.\n\nBut while we can\u2019t champion UFO 50 as 50 instant masterpieces, we also can\u2019t paint it with the broad brush of being uniformly old-school ornery for its old sake\u2014or a nostalgia exercise with no appeal for players who didn\u2019t grow up pulling battered NES carts off the rental wall of their local video store. The truth is that this really is 50 different games, each with their own control schemes and design hooks, and the quality is inevitably going to vary. Part of the fun of the package, in fact, is in that kind of discovery: For every game you play five minutes of before concluding \u201cEh, not for me,\u201d you\u2019re just as likely to run into something like the boldly strange Mooncat, or \u201cWhat if we\u2019d invented tower defense games on the NES\u201d hypothetical Rock On! Island. At the bare minimum, each title has something genuinely clever powering it, whether it\u2019s Mortol\u2018s attempt to build an action game out of Lemmings DNA, or Avianos\u2018 bird-based war gaming. Half the time, when we caught ourselves thinking \u201cOkay, we get it, let\u2019s move on\u201d after poking around at a game, we turned out to be basically right; the other half, though, we inevitably stumbled into some new secret or twist of play that deepened the experience of an individual title.\n\nUFO 50 is, in other words, a game that trusts you, the player, to find the fun\u2014with the promise that there is a lot of fun to be found in this odd, massive toy chest. We should note that the game does have a few curation tools\u2014if you scroll down to the bottom of the collection, you can filter games by whether they\u2019re meant to be more reflex based, or cerebral, for instance, or focus in on the title\u2019s large number of same-screen multiplayer games. (Breaking free of the chronology is a good idea in any case; although UFO 50 doesn\u2019t pay as much attention to the \u201ccomplexity increases as fictional time passes\u201d conceit that powered Retro Game Challenge, you\u2019ll still tend to find more robust experiences closer to the end of UFOSoft\u2019s fictional lifespan.) We\u2019re sure we\u2019ll soon see a cottage industry of guides and wider critiques pointing out hidden gems buried in its library. But honestly, we recommend just doing what the game itself advises: Scroll through until you find a title that sounds cool, blow off the fictional dust, and take a gamble on the chance you\u2019ll hit something that\u2019ll be one of your favorite games of 2024."

        "article_content": "In a wide-ranging interview with PEOPLE, Louis Elizondo tells PEOPLE that the US government has retrieved \u201cnon-human\u201d technology and specimens from crashed spacecraft\n\nDepartment of Defense An image from the so-called \u201cGimbal\u201d video recorded by a U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet fighter pilot off the coast of Jacksonville, Fla., during a 2015 encounter with a UAP. Elizondo helped get the video released to bring more transparency to the government and its awareness of UAP.\n\nIt\u2019s been seven years since Luis Elizondo began making headlines after resigning from his job as a senior intelligence official for a top-secret Pentagon program that investigated UFO's \u2014 also known as UAP's or unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 and going public about his frustration over the lack of transparency on the issue.\n\nThe longtime military intelligence veteran spent nearly seven years as director for the Department of Defense\u2019s clandestine Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. What he learned during his tenure convinced him that the countless sightings and encounters with highly advanced aerial phenomena by military pilots and personnel posed a potentially grave threat to our national defense.\n\nInstead of dismissing these reports, he wanted Pentagon higher-ups to wake up to the possible dangers our nation \u2014 and planet \u2014 face by these unexplained phenomena.\n\n\u201cThe amount of stigma and taboo that was placed on this topic for so long has really paralyzed the conversation,\u201d the former U.S. Army Counterintelligence Special Agent \u2014 who served in Afghanistan and ran antiterrorism missions \u2014 told PEOPLE in 2021. \u201cBut these things are real. We don\u2019t know what they are yet, but they are real, so we should probably take them seriously.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Luis Elizondo Elizondo at the Capitol while visiting members of Congress in 2024.\n\nRelated: 4 Shocking Moments from Congress' UFO Hearing, from 'Non-Human' Pilots to Possible Contact with Aliens\n\nBy 2023, Elizondo\u2019s revelations had led to congressional inquiries that included mind-blowing testimony and videos from Navy pilots recounting their run-ins with aerial craft that defied our understanding of physics and a one-time intelligence official who alleged that the U.S. government possessed objects of nonhuman origin taken from crash sites.\n\nNow, Elizondo has written a book \u2014 Imminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt For UFOs \u2014 that provides a behind-the-scenes look at the secret program he once helmed, what they learned, and why he felt compelled to resign and go public.\n\n\u201cIt had to be reviewed by the Pentagon, which took almost a year,\u201d says Elizondo, who corroborates the astonishing claim that technology and non-human remains have been retrieved from the location of crashed craft.\n\nHe adds, \u201cI tried every way I could to make it unclassified and they still redacted portions of it, which I actually left in the book [in blacked-out sentences and paragraphs] so everybody could see what sections the Pentagon didn\u2019t want you to read.\u201d\n\nIn a wide-ranging conversation, Elizondo discusses the revelations contained in the pages of his new book and why he believes that our government can no longer ignore what he says has the potential to become the greatest existential danger that humanity has ever faced.\n\nHarper Collins The front cover of Elizondo's new book.\n\nTell me more about your motivation to write this book?\n\nI think Americans can handle the truth, and I think Americans deserve the truth. The truth is, \"We don\u2019t know what\u2019s in our skies.\" So that was my motivation. More importantly, we are encountering these things over controlled U.S. airspace, over sensitive military installations, and we've been dealing with it for decades. I still have my security clearance and, now, when I go back to the Pentagon, people come up to me and shake my hand and say, \"Man, this is so great. Thank you so much for what you do.\"\n\nBecause before, if you said the term UFO or UAP, you had to whisper it in the back corner of a scif [a U.S. Department of Defense term for a secure room where sensitive military and security information can be discussed]. Now you can be at the lunchroom at the Pentagon and talk about UFOs all day long in the open and no one criticizes you. Now it's a conversation about national security. It's no longer a conspiracy theory. It's now, unfortunately, a conspiracy fact.\n\n\n\nCourtesy Luis Elizondo Elizondo (with former FBI Director Robert Mueller) in Kandahar where he was working with various US agencies to locate terrorist cells in the area.\n\nSo you essentially see UAPs as a national security threat?\n\nI never say threat. There's a difference because in order to understand what a threat is, there's two parts of a calculus \u2014 capabilities versus intent. We've seen the capabilities, but we still have no idea of the intent.\n\nLet me give you a simple analogy. I\u2019m sure you lock your doors at night before you go to bed. And, if you have it, you turn on your alarm system. Let's say one morning you wake up, go downstairs to make a cup of coffee and you suddenly see size 12 muddy boot prints on your living room carpet that were not there the night before. No one in your house has been hurt, nothing's been taken. But despite your doors being locked and the alarm being turned on, there are now muddy boot prints on your living room carpet that were not there the night before. My question is\u2014is that a threat? And my response is \u2014 it could be if it wanted to be.\n\nSo what should our government\u2019s response be?\n\nWe should probably be diligent and try to figure out how it's getting in. We've got things that are coming into controlled U.S. airspace over sensitive military installations, interfering with our nuclear capabilities. In some cases, they are creating air hazards with our military weapon platforms like F-18s. They\u2019ve been seen by eyewitnesses, and it's been corroborated by and recorded by gun camera footage. It\u2019s also been corroborated by radar. In some cases we\u2019re seeing up to seven sensor units all reporting the same information at the same time, at the same place, under the same circumstances.\n\nSo we're talking about something real. This is not just an atmospheric aberration or grandma seeing some lights in the backyard. This is real and it's impacting our ability to do our national security mission. So that's why I say that this is a national security issue. Is it a threat? We don't know. But from a governmental perspective, even if there's a one percent chance that this could be a threat, then we have to do our due diligence and make sure that it's not a threat.\n\nCourtesy Luis Elizondo A biological sample, and\u2014according to Elizondo\u2014\"possible\" implant, collected (with patient consent) for analysis in 2018.\n\nSo U.S. government actually has downed space craft that was manufactured by non-human intelligence?\n\nI have to be careful about what I say and stick to what has been approved in my book. I'm not allowed to go beyond that. What I've said is that the U.S. government is in possession of exotic material that appears not to be made by human beings. Now, are these things extraterrestrial? All options have to be on the table until they're no longer on the table.\n\nYou also wrote that the U.S. government is in possession of non-human bodies?\n\nWe have biological samples. I want to be careful saying \"bodies\" because a body infers that you have an intact, entire cadaver or corpse. What I can say is that biological samples have been recovered. And of course, you can fill in the blanks on what that means. It appears that we as a country may be in possession of multiple samples.\n\nCould other countries also be in possession of these specimens and non-human technology?\n\nThat is the concern \u2014 that other countries also have UFO programs. We know it for a fact because the Russians admitted it to us after the Iron Curtain fell and they shared their files with us. They [the Russians] got some pretty compelling information. And here we are pretending like it doesn't exist. Meanwhile, the Russians and the Chinese are going full tilt boogie. That's a problem.\n\nHave you ever held a piece of alien technology in your hands?\n\nI don't want to say \u201calien.\u201d We prefer to say \u201cnon-human.\u201d But, yes. It was a metallic surface that was beveled and had multiple layers of material inside of it. It had all sorts of interesting electrical properties. It was not natural. It was definitely engineered. When we showed it to scientists at one of the top aerospace corporations in the world, they just scratched their heads and said it can\u2019t be manufactured. And yet there it was.\n\n\n\nRelated: Pentagon Authorizes Release of U.S. Navy Videos Showing 'Unidentified' Flying Objects\n\nCan you give me an overview \u2014 in terms of things like speed and acceleration \u2014 of just how truly astonishing this technology is?\n\nSure. Let's look at the five observables. The first observable is instantaneous acceleration \u2014 the ability to change direction and change your velocity very rapidly. When you do that, there are inertial forces [inside the craft] that are experienced. We refer to them as g-forces. A human being can withstand about nine g-forces for a very short period of time while wearing a g-suit to counteract the biological effects of heavy g-forces. If you experience g-forces for too long, you start experiencing biological consequences such as blackouts and, ultimately, death.\n\nOne of the most highly maneuverable aircraft we have is the F-16. At the unclassified level, that plane can pull about seventeen g\u2019s before you start having structural failure, meaning the plane literally begins to disintegrate in midair. The objects that we're detecting are performing up to a four-thousand g\u2019s. That\u2019s well beyond anything that we have from a material science perspective to withstand [these forces]. Biologically, it would turn you [or whatever is inside of it] into the consistency of pudding.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nNext, you have the second observable known as hypersonic velocity, used to describe speeds of Mach five or above. One Mach is equal to the speed of sound, which is roughly 760 miles an hour at sea level. Do we have vehicles that can do Mach five hypersonic? Yes. We have, for example, the Lockheed SR-71. That plane can fly around thirty-two-hundred miles an hour. But when that plane wants to make a right-hand turn, it takes roughly half the state of Ohio to do it. What we are seeing are objects not doing thirty-two-hundred miles an hour, but they're doing ten-thousand to thirteen-thousand miles an hour. And they\u2019re doing immediate right-hand turns. The third observable is a bit of an oxymoron. It's called low-observability, meaning that it\u2019s hard to see on radar. You're getting these nonsensical returns [on the radar screen]. They are also hard to see with the naked eye. The pilots [who have observed them] will say, \u2018Look, I don't know what to tell you. I saw it, but I can't explain it. It didn't have wings. It didn't have a rudder. It didn't even have a cockpit. It looked like a tic-tac. Or it looked like a saucer or a triangle.\u2019\n\nThe fourth observable is called trans-medium travel, the ability to operate in multiple domains or environments. What we are seeing are objects that can perform the same maneuvers in our atmosphere in high altitudes to potentially low-earth orbit and even underwater without any compromises. The last observable is anti-gravity. What that means, in a nutshell, is the ability to defy the natural effects of earth's gravity. These craft have no wings. They don't have any obvious sites of propulsion. There's no obvious means for them to defy earth's gravity. And yet somehow they're able to do that. So when you have a technology that can do all five of these things, you are forced to reconcile the fact that you're dealing with something that is certainly not conventional. Our government has already said, for the record, it's not our technology. And our government has also said, for the record, that it's probably not adversarial technology. So what does that leave?\n\n\n\nHow much energy would it take to power such a craft?\n\nSo in some cases, [the energy required for maneuvers that have been observed by Navy pilots] was equivalent to the power output of the entire United States in a single day. In other cases, it would be equivalent to the power output of the United States in three years.\n\nAre reports of encounters with these craft from military personnel happening every day?\n\nI have to be careful about what I say, but these occurrences occur sometimes on a daily basis.\n\nCourtesy Luis Elizondo A sample of bismuth and magnesium that was produced by an aerospace company, hoping to mimic materials that Elizondo says were recovered and of non-Earth origin. \u201cThe best they were able to achieve,\u201d writes Elizondo in his book, \u201cwas this small \u2018brick\u2019 that had only one layer, each brick costing over a million dollars to produce.\u201d\n\nAny theories on why these alleged visitations are occurring?\n\nWell, we know that they're interested in our nuclear capabilities. We know that they're interested in our military equities. In human terms, one could speculate that this is some sort of reconnaissance mission. But we don't know. We're looking through anthropomorphic eyes and intentions and motivations. As humans, we do that with each other. But does that necessarily translate to this? Maybe, but we can't, from a national security perspective, take that chance can we? Because remember, it goes back to the equation \u2014 capabilities versus intent. We see the capabilities. We have no idea the intent.\n\nAnd clearly what engineers are attempting to do is to reverse-engineer this technology to understand how it works and then find a way to use it ourselves?\n\nOf course. That\u2019s also maybe the reason why we don't want to have too much of a conversation about this topic. Maybe we don't want our adversaries to know what we may or may not have been able to glean technologically from this. And, by the way, I would never support compromising that information either way. So I don't comment on it. And I am certainly not going to confirm or deny whether or not the US government has indeed reverse engineered this technology.\n\nYou write about objects that have been surgically removed from the bodies of U.S. soldiers who claimed to have had contact with these non-human visitors. Can you expand upon that?\n\nThis was from a U.S. service member who claimed to have had a close encounter with a UAP \u2014 and it was not an isolated incident. In this particular case, you have what appeared to be some sort of very small technical device inside a human body and a surgeon from the Department of Veterans Affairs who successfully isolated it and removed it. But before he could remove it, according to the report, it kept trying to evade capture. Every time he would try to isolate it, it would move [within the veteran\u2019s body]. When he finally was able to remove it from the patient, and it was placed in a petri dish for analysis, it continued moving under its own power source, but ultimately it stopped moving. I can\u2019t tell you how long, but it continued to move by itself long enough for the pathologist to be very concerned. It was encapsulated in human biological tissue, possibly in an attempt to avoid detection. It appeared to be made from some sort of metal. It was square and almost looked like mother of pearl and metallic with different kinds of colors like purples and silver.\n\nDepartment of Defense An image from another 2015 encounter with a UAP taken by a Navy fighter jet off the Florida coast.\n\nAnd what would be the purpose of these entities putting implants in humans?\n\nWhy do we microchip our dogs? So if they get lost, we can find them. Why do we microchip the wildebeest in the Serengeti? We want to look at their migratory patterns and their health and [learn about things like] its blood oxygen levels.\n\nYou also discuss in your book some of the health impacts that people, who have gotten too close to this technology, have experienced. Tell me more about that.\n\nThere were actually medical doctors on the U.S. government payroll that were looking at military personnel and intelligence officials who had a close encounter, got too close and suffered medical consequences both externally and internally. These have been documented. There are a lot of these patients. And these people have sustained injuries that were consistent with some sort of directed energy like what might happen if you get too close to a microwave oven. It was the late Senator John McCain who succeeded in getting two special police officers for the Air Force put on full medical disability because they got too close to a U.A.P. [near a military airfield in Suffolk, England, in 1980] and sustained injuries. I mean, if that's not proof that the government knows what's going on, I don't know what is. You don't put people on a hundred percent disability for getting close to a UFO unless you admit that UFOs are real.\n\nIs it accurate to assume that what you write about in Imminent is just the tip of the iceberg of what you know and encountered while working on this program?\n\nThere's a lot more. There's other people who were in my program that will be coming out with additional information that I think will help move this conversation forward. I can't say anything publicly until they come out, but there's a lot of things happening behind the scenes.\n\nAre you confident that our government is finally moving in the right direction on this issue?\n\nWell, let's look at facts. Since last time you and I had a chat [in 2021], we have a former director of National Intelligence, a former director of the CIA, and a former president of the United States, who have all come out on the record to say, \"Yeah, there's something to this. It's real.\" We have the creation of a UFO investigative body that is officially looking at UAP\u2019s for the government. You have landmark congressional legislation that's been passed, with more legislation that's coming. You have whistleblowers coming out and testifying before Congress under oath in front of the American people. Yeah, we've come a long way, my friend. But we've still got a long way to go.\n\n\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!\n\nRead the original article on People."

        "article_content": "The ongoing galactic game of 20 questions contnues with people and governments trying to confirm the origins UFOs and UAPs are related to aliens in any shape or form. The most recent Pentagon report seems to conclude that most of the sightings people have witnessed haven't necessarily been related to extraterrestrials. Instead, these \"craft\" were likely connected to secret projects by groups and governments right here on Earth. The phone call is coming from inside the house.\n\nNo matter what you believe about the nature of \"flying saucers,\" there is one sighting labeled the \"most convincing\" UFO encounter in history. According to CBC, the Falcon Lake incident in Canada is being called the \"best-documented UFO case\" 50 years after the actual event.\n\nThe story has been covered in books and shows, including Unsolved Mysteries at one point, but it originates from May 1967 in the Falcon Lake woods in Manitoba, Canada. \"I recalled seeing him in bed. He didn't look good at all. He looked pale, haggard,\" Stan Michalak said about his father. \"When I walked into the bedroom there was a huge stink in the room, like a real horrible aroma of sulphur and burnt motor. It was all around and it was coming out of his pores. It was bad.\"\n\nMichalak was only a nine-year-old at the time but has detailed the incident as co-author of When They Appear, a book written with UFO researcher Chris Rutkowski. The book came out in 2017, but recently resurfaced due to coverage online at outlets like Daily Star.\n\nAccording to the account, Stefan Michalak was in the woods when he encountered a pair of \"cigar-shaped objects\" nearby, changing hues while floating before taking a disc shape. Michalak started drawing what he saw, which made their way online years later, before trying to get closer to the object.\n\n\"He couldn't make out any words, or anything, but he heard at least two beings communicating inside. He called out, offering mechanical help if they needed it,\" the It Gets Weird podcast recently detailed. \"As soon as he touches the craft, the fingertips just start to melt, so it's so hot that it literally melts the gloves he's wearing...He's hit by this blast of air, that pushes him backward and sets his shirt and hat on fire. He's stumbling backward, getting pushed by this wave of air and gas, and trying to take this burning shirt and hat off.\"\n\nThe account goes on to say he showed symptoms of radiation sickness and had \"severe burns\" on his torso that look like a grate or Bingo card. Once released from the hospital, he returned to the locale to recover his \"charred shirt, a melted glove and tools he'd left behind.\" He maintained his story until dying in 1999, never saying he encountered little green men either."

Tech toy company Skyrocket hopes you'll see Poe the AI Story Bear as the former. The plush toy employs AI models from OpenAI to compose new stories based on ideas suggested by a child, which are then told by the bear in a friendly, but synthetic voice produced with ElevenLabs' AI speech creator.\n\nThe customized stories are put together by the AI model using a wide range of options that a child can pick from the accompanying Poe AI Bear: Story Creator app. There are hundreds of curated options for story elements, and kids can pick a wide range of themes, characters, and locations for the story, even inserting themselves into it. If they like the resulting story, they can save it to listen to again or move on and try out other options next time.\n\nBecause of the AI used to come up with the stories, there may be similarities based on the chosen icons in the app, but each story will ultimately be different even if the same options are chosen multiple times. There's only one AI voice included with Poe, but ElevenLabs' models give it context-aware emotional tones and otherwise mimic how a human speaks. Poe can tell stories in 30 languages, the ones built into the ElevenLabs model.\n\n\"Poe the AI Story Bear empowers kids with the ability to create amazing, personalized stories that they'll love listening to again and again,\" Skyrocket CEO Nelo Lucich explained. \"It's always been a dream to have toys that come alive and now it's possible with AI. Poe the AI Story Bear embraces the positive aspects of AI technology and makes it accessible to all types of consumers from diverse backgrounds and languages and at a budget-friendly price point.\"\n\nAI Toy Story\n\nOf course, for a child's product, safety is going to be a major concern. To assuage worries, Skyrocket has designed Poe to only pull input from the app, so there are no cameras, microphones, or direct internet access, just Bluetooth to link to the mobile device. There are also stricter than usual safeguards on the content the AI model suggests for the story. That's also why the options for themes and characters are curated, limiting the chance of anything inappropriate inadvertently coming up.\n\nThe high-tech power of Poe is surprisingly affordable at $50. Skyrocket has ambitions to develop a whole line of toys with AI-powered features, but the real question is if parents will see Poe as their child's more talkative Buzz Lightyear or a sinister latter-day Furby.\n\nYou might also like"

        "date": "11h",
        "source": "USA Today",
        "article_content": "Prakash Sangam\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThis story was updated to correct a byline.\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: Due to a production error, an earlier version of this story inadvertently included the wrong byline. It has been corrected.\n\nIf you are looking to buy a new laptop for this school year or as a gift during the holiday season, you will be faced with a major decision: Should you buy a next-generation AI-powered Copilot+ PC? However, the recent flurry of announcements by laptop OEMs and chip providers that power them has made that decision almost a misnomer.\n\nWhat is a Copilot+ PC, and why do you need it?\n\nCopilot+ PCs are a new breed of laptops with significant on-device (Generative) Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities. To get this moniker from Windows provider Microsoft, laptops must meet or exceed specific minimum AI processing requirements. For the technically inclined, the requirement is to have a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) with at least 40 TOPS (Trillion Operations Per Second) processing power. Copilot+ PCs offer a full day or more battery life, lightning-fast performance, enhanced user experience and are very thin, light and sleek.\n\nCurrently, most of the AI processing happens in the cloud, which means all your information, be it your interaction with ChatGPT or text-to-image creation with many tools, is sent to the cloud. However, with Copilot+ PCs, most of that processing happens on the device. That means your data remains private and securely stored in the device. Additionally, on-device AI is more accurate, personalized, relevant and almost free. If you want more details on this, please check my articles here and here.\n\nEven if you are not looking to use AI, you have to buy Copilot+ PCs, as they are the best of the breed, most secure and best-looking laptops in the market today, outperforming anything else, even Apple\u2019s MacBook.\n\nAll Copilot+ PCs are not created equal\n\nCopilot+ PCs have a lot of variances in terms of the chip platforms, various configurations of those platforms, many OEMs, price and performance tiers and more. It all started when the smartphone technology giant Qualcomm joined Microsoft and scores of PC OEMs to introduce the first Copilot+ PCs based on its Snapdragon XElite and XPlus platforms in May of this year. They set a new bar for laptop performance.\n\nFollowing Qualcomm, the personal computing giant Intel and AMD introduced their Copilot+ PC platforms. Intel\u2019s platform is called Core Ultra 200V (project name Lunar Lake), and AMD\u2019s is called Ryzen AI300. Many OEMs announced laptops with these platforms at the recently concluded European consumer show IFA.\n\nThere are some key differences between Qualcomm and Intel/AMD platforms. Qualcomm platforms are designed using the technology from Arm, a British company. This technology has been used in smartphones for over twenty years and is known for its exceptional power efficiency. Qualcomm introduced this for PC platforms to achieve path-breaking battery life and thin, light and sleek designs, and it set the target for other vendors. Because it is new, the Arm for Windows app ecosystem is still developing. Almost all essential apps are supported, but some apps, especially some games, may not yet be supported.\n\nIntel and AMD platforms are based on X86 technology, which has been around for over 30 years, so app compatibility is not the issue. However, the Core Ultra 200V and Ryzen AI300 are new designs, and their performance is not yet proven.\n\nSo, when choosing Copilot+ PCs, along with price points, features and others, users must also be aware of the platforms used on those PCs. For reference, here is my review of Lenovo\u2019s Yoga Slim 7x.\n\nUSA TODAY Home Internet:See the best and most reliable broadband plans in your area\n\nWhy is it a good time to buy them now?\n\nTechnology is akin to waves in the ocean \u2014 by the time one reaches shore, another one is ready just behind it. If you want to get the maximum benefits of the latest technology, you must jump in when it is reasonably mature, with ample choices in the market. Copilot+ PCs are exactly at that stage now.\n\nAlmost all PC OEMs now offer Copilot+ PCs, including Lenovo, Dell, HP, Samsung, Microsoft, Asus, Acer and many others. They are available for both consumer and enterprise segments at all price points. For example, PC market leader Lenovo has ThinkPad for enterprises, Yoga for premium consumers, IdeaPad for mid/value-tier and more. Each segment has different variations to suit every consumer and business need. Other PC OEMs have similar offerings as well. At IFA, Qualcomm even introduced a new platform targeting laptops in the $700 range.\n\nMicrosoft offers many Copilot+ AI features and applications for better video calls, live captioning in many languages, text-to-image creation and more. AI is still in its infancy; as we progress, there will be a continuous flow of innovative and user experience-enhancing AI apps and features.\n\nOne key common factor among all Copilot+ PC platforms is that they have the same AI capability across tiers. For example, Qualcomm\u2019s XElite and XPlus have the same AI processor. This means no matter which Copilot+ PC you choose, you get excellent performance for years to come. In summary, if you are in the market for a laptop this year, go ahead and consider a Copilot+ PC."

        "article_content": "The discovery of artifacts associated with an ancient board game is offering clues about how humans interacted thousands of years ago.\n\nAt various sites on the Ab\u015feron Peninsula and Gobustan Reserve in Azerbaijan, archaeologists have found six designs carved into the surfaces of rocks. Dating to around 2000 BCE, they each resemble the hallmark pattern on which the ancient board game Hounds and Jackals is based. This is contemporaneous with the previous oldest example of the game ever found, hailing from the tomb of a government official of ancient Egypt.\n\nThe locations challenge the presumed origins of the game, also known as Fifty-Eight Holes, say archaeologists Walter Crist of Leiden University in the Netherlands and Rahman Abdullayev of the Minnesota Historical Society. It could have emerged in south-western Asia, rather than Egypt, as experts had previously supposed.\n\nBut, wherever it emerged, the discovery highlights something very important about board games: they are an excellent way to forge social bonds, across not just distance, but social class: the Azerbaijan artifacts were likely used by cattle herders.\n\n\"At certain times in antiquity, particular games were regionally popular, suggesting that they helped to connect cultures that regularly interacted with one another,\" Crist and Abdullayev write in their paper.\n\n\"The game of Fifty-Eight Holes probably served this purpose in the second millennium BCE in Egypt and south-western Asia, because it was the only game that was played throughout the region.\"\n\nThe history of board games goes back thousands of years, and appears to be widespread. At some point, someone must have been the first to have scrawled a pattern in the dust and joined with fellow humans in a game of something. We can't know what that something is, but we can piece together an incomplete history based on the artifacts of board games left behind, from dice to pieces to the boards themselves.\n\nHounds and Jackals \u2013 named for an example of the game where the pieces had hound and jackal heads \u2013 is what is known as a race game, where two players move pieces around a track in an attempt to be the first to reach the end, like Snakes and Ladders, or Ludo. It has 58 holes in a specific pattern, and the pieces \u2013 five hounds and five jackals \u2013 are placed in new holes as the players move around the board. Presumably the player who gets all their pieces to the end first wins.\n\nTo date, around 70 gameboards for Hounds and Jackals have been discovered, many in Egypt. These include the oldest dated example, which was found in a tomb at El-Assasif dated some time between 2064 and 1952 BCE. From this, the assumption was that the game had originated in Egypt and spread from there.\n\nCrist and Abdullayev discovered their six 'board' designs at various sites across Azerbaijan: three were found at A\u011fda\u015fd\u00fcz\u00fc, and one each at \u00c7apmal\u0131, Yen\u0131 T\u00fcrkan, and D\u00fcb\u0259ndi. They consisted of carvings in rocks, where the holes have been picked out. Dating them is a bit challenging, but the use of these sites and the other artifacts within them give a rough timeframe: while the A\u011fda\u015fd\u00fcz\u00fc boards are dated to the second millennium BCE, the other three are from between the second half of the third millennium BCE and the first half of the second.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nThis means that they are roughly contemporaneous with the El-Assasif board, and may even predate it. However, even if the boards are from around the same time, the simultaneous appearance suggests that Egypt may not have been the birthplace of Hounds and Jackals, after all.\n\nAnd the locations of the Azerbaijan finds suggest that the game was enjoyed across the social spectrum. In \u00c7apmal\u0131 the game board was found in a cave that was used as a winter shelter by cattle herders, while in Yeni T\u00fcrkan and D\u00fcb\u0259ndi, the games were found in tombs of the wealthy. The wide geographical spread, and range of social contexts in which the game has been found, suggests that Hounds and Jackals was a powerful tool for making connections, forging friendships, and assessing trustworthiness between people.\n\n\"Whatever the origin of the game of Fifty-Eight Holes, it was quickly adopted and played by a wide variety of people, from the nobility of Middle Kingdom Egypt to the cattle herders of the Caucasus, and from the Old Assyrian traders in Anatolia to the workers who built Middle Kingdom pyramids,\" the researchers write.\n\n\"The fast spread of this game attests to the ability of games to act as social lubricants, facilitating interactions across social boundaries.\"\n\nAnd that's as true now as it was then.\n\nThe research has been published in the European Journal of Archaeology."

An El Ni\u00f1o is declared when sea temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific rise 0.5 \u00b0C above the long-term average.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd while volcanic activity definitely played a big role in the \u2018Great Dying\u2019 (the worst mass extinction in Earth\u2019s history, also known as the Permian-Triassic extinction), experts say the impact of these El Ni\u00f1os shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nChina University of Geosciences\u2019 Professor Yadong Sun claims that oxygen isotopes in fossils suggest they could have been greatly involved in this mass loss of life.\n\nHe said: \u201cMost life failed to adapt to these conditions, but thankfully a few things survived, without which we wouldn\u2019t be here today. It was nearly, but not quite, the end of life on Earth.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming had an impact (Getty Stock Image)\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd co-lead author of this study, Dr Alexander Farnsworth, from the University of Bristol, added: \u201cClimate warming alone cannot drive such devastating extinctions because, as we are seeing today, when the tropics become too hot, species migrate to the cooler, higher latitudes.\n\n\u201cOur research has revealed that increased greenhouse gases don\u2019t just make the majority of the planet warmer, they also increase weather and climate variability making it even more 'wild' and difficult for life to survive.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the exact cause of the Great Dying remains somewhat uncertain but it\u2019s pretty complicated.\n\nAs well as so much time having obviously passed since, there\u2019s a scarcity of fossils to study and a complexity of evidence. Either way, scientists know something big happened to have such a big consequence."

        "article_content": "NordVPN is one of the most popular and best virtual private networks (VPNs) available, while Proton VPN is a relative newcomer that launched several years after it. Both have thousands of servers worldwide and boast high-speed streaming and download capacity without sacrificing security and privacy.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly hard to choose between these leading VPNs when the pricing is so close. I recently reviewed NordVPN and Proton VPN, so I\u2019ll share details about pricing and renewal costs, hands-on speed tests, and customer service responsiveness.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nUltimately, I\u2019ll share my recommendation for the best VPN to fit your budget while protecting your privacy and delivering consistently great performance.\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nStarting at the free tier, Proton VPN takes the lead with a full-featured app that can connect to 136 servers in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Japan. There\u2019s no data cap or artificial limits placed on speed. Proton VPN is among the best free VPNs with few restrictions. NordVPN doesn\u2019t have a free version.\n\nBoth offer a 30-day money-back guarantee but no trial period. That means you have to pay for a subscription to try the full version of either VPN. Each company supports 10 devices with paid service so you can use the VPN on all your devices and share with family members.\n\nNordVPN costs $13 per month, while Proton VPN comes in at $10 monthly. The best value comes with a longer subscription. NordVPN starts at $60 for the first year, but renews at $139.08. The equivalent monthly cost is $5 initially, but increases to $12 thereafter. A two-year subscription starts at $97 and includes three free months. That works out to $3.60 monthly, a great deal for 27 months. But watch out for the renewal cost, which skyrockets to $313.\n\nProton VPN has a less expensive $10 monthly plan and matches NordVPN\u2019s $60 annual subscription. The two-year plan costs $108. Proton doesn\u2019t charge more when you need to renew, so both monthly and renewal costs are better.\n\nBoth services have software bundles that add more features if you pay more.\n\nFeatures\n\nWhen I reviewed NordVPN, I was more than satisfied with its speed and reliability. I consistently enjoyed quick server connections and download speeds measuring 32% to 52% of my gigabit Ethernet connection. That\u2019s hundreds of megabits per second worldwide.\n\nAs impressive as NordVPN\u2019s performance was, Proton VPN nearly matched it by delivering 26% to 50% of my unprotected internet download speed. Proton VPN suffered from slow uploads, a common complaint with even the best VPNs.\n\nWhile NordVPN managed up to 29 Mbps uploads, the best I got with Proton VPN was 14 Mbps. To be fair, server connections are generally optimized for downloading content, with only a bit reserved to keep the connection responsive as you search and browse.\n\nBoth feature solid VPN connections to thousands of servers in over 100 countries. To get around administrative firewallls, NordVPN has the NordLynx protocol and Proton VPN has Stealth.\n\nSupport\n\nNordVPN has an advantage when it comes to customer service. You can search and browse the support center for help documents. If you run into a problem that you can\u2019t figure out on your own, NordVPN offers 24/7 live chat. I tested the response time and found it to be quick and informative.\n\nProton VPN provides live chat support for paid subscribers, but only during business hours. Still, you can get help quickly during a 15-hour window daily. I received fast and thorough replies to my questions. If you reach out when live chat is closed, Proton\u2019s support documents are available anytime.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nNordVPN prioritizes user privacy with a strict no-logs policy and no data sharing with third parties. Like all good VPNs, NordVPN uses end-to-end encryption to protect your data, as well as hides your IP address and location.\n\nProton VPN is open-source software with a privacy focus, a strict no-logs policy, and secure data storage practices. Proton was founded by CERN scientists in 2014 to ensure private communications and carries that mission forward with all its apps and services.\n\nBoth service get regular independent audits to check security and verify that no logs are retained. Your data should be secure and private with either VPN.\n\nWhich VPN is right for you?\n\nAs you can tell, NordVPN and Proton VPN are closely matched,with similar pricing and features. The primary difference is in pricing tiers. NordVPN offers more bundle variety, which might be appealing if you have particular needs that Proton VPN can\u2019t meet affordably.\n\nFor some people, Proton Free might be all they need. It\u2019s fast, free, and includes free versions of Proton VPN, Proton Mail, Proton Pass, and more.\n\nIf you need access to more servers, but for a limited time, Proton VPN\u2019s monthly fee is less expensive than NordVPN\u2019s. If you anticipate long-term use of a VPN, Proton VPN\u2019s consistent pricing when you renew means you\u2019ll continue saving when it comes time to renew your subscription.\n\nFor most people, Proton VPN is the best solution whether you use the free version or subscribe.\n\nIf neither solution seems like a good fit, there are plenty of fast and reliable VPNs to choose from. It\u2019s also worth checking out our list of VPN deals to see if you can save some money while protecting your privacy."

But is there any merit in holding on to an older iPhone?\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro is the focus for most buyers\u2019 \u201ckeep or jump\u201d dilemma. A remnant of the Lightning port era, the iPhone 14 Pro continues to prove its mettle as a reliable warhorse with a terrific camera. But the kind of comprehensive changes across screen, silicon, charging, and software perameters introduced by the iPhone 16 Pro also make it a candidate for an upgrade.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIf you\u2019ve been holding on tight to your iPhone 14 and aren\u2019t sure if there are any meaningful advancements to warrant a spending spree, here\u2019s a detailed breakdown to guide your upgrade decision.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: specs\n\nSpecs iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Size 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25 mm (5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches) 147.5 x 71.5 x 7.85 mm (5.81 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches) Weight 199 g (7.03 oz) 206 g (7.27 oz) Screen 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR OLED 1206 x 2622 pixels ProMotion with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate Dolby Vision, 2,000 nits brightness 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED 1179 x 2556 pixels ProMotion with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate Dolby Vision, 2,000 nits brightness Operating system iOS 18 iOS 18 Build Titanium with textured\n\nmatt glass back Stainless steel with textured matt glass back Buttons Action Button\n\nCamera Control Ring/Silent switch Storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB Processor Apple A18 Pro Six-core CPU Six-core GPU 16-core NPU Apple A16 Bionic Six-core CPU Five-core GPU 16-core NPU Camera Rear: 48-megapixel primary, f/1.8, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 120\u00b0 FOV 12MP telephoto, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Front: 12MP, f/1.9 aperture Rear: 48MP primary, f/1.78, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 120\u00b0 FOV 12MP telephoto, f/1.78, 3x optical zoom Front: 12MP, f/1.9 aperture Video Rear: 4K, up to 120 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Rear: 4K, up to 60 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, dual-band Bluetooth 5.3 Wi-Fi 6, dual-band Bluetooth 5.3 Ports USB-C Gen 3.2 DisplayPort Lightning USB 2.0 Water resistance IP68 (maximum depth of 6m up to 30 minutes) IP68 (maximum depth of 6m up to 30 minutes) Battery & charging Up to 23 hours video playback 45W fast charging 25W wireless charging via MagSafe 15W Qi2 wireless charging Up to 27 hours video playback 25W fast charging 15W wireless charging via MagSafe 7.5W Qi wireless charging Colors Black Titanium, White Titanium, Natural Titanium, Desert Titanium Space Black, Silver, Gold, Deep Purple Price Starts at $999 Starts at $999\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: design and display\n\nThere isn\u2019t much to discuss here about any design overhaul, as the fundamental aesthetic language is identical. However, there are a few refinements that can only be felt when the two devices are held in hand. The iPhone 16 Pro is slightly taller and thicker than the iPhone 14 Pro, and a touch lighter too. That weight disparity predominantly has to do with the build\u2019s material of choice. The latest flagship from Apple relies on titanium, which is lighter, more resilient, and better equipped to handle heat dissipation. The iPhone 14 Pro, on the other hand, has a stainless steel frame married to a matte glass shell.\n\nAnother crucial difference concerns the edges. The iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s sides were quite sharp and the phone dug into the palm in quite an uncomfortable fashion. The iPhone 16 Pro takes a more rounded approach to the edges, making it cozier to hold, if not a day-and-night difference.\n\nApple has also slimmed down the bezels to accommodate a larger display on the phone. With the iPhone 16 Pro, you also get USB-C (Gen 3 port with Display Port support) with 10Gbps output as it ditches the Lightning Port (USB Gen 2) on the iPhone 14 Pro. In a nutshell, you get faster data transfer bandwidth and liberation from the dongle life.\n\nThe ingress protection is identical across both phones at an IP68 level, but the color options vary. The iPhone 16 Pro serves up a new Desert Titanium look that\u2019s somewhat inspired by the gold trim on the iPhone 16 Pro, but the latter\u2019s signature Deep Purple is gone. The rest of Apple\u2019s latest options include silver, white, and black.\n\nAnother core difference, as mentioned above, is the display. The iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3-inch panel, up from the 6.1-inch OLED screen on the iPhone 14 Pro. The rest of the attributes, such as pixel density, peak refresh rate, and brightness output remain identical. Apple says the latest iteration of Ceramic Shield on the iPhone 16 Pro is twice as strong, while the OLED panel\u2019s brightness can drop to as low as 1 nit, which is technically great news from the lens of power efficiency.\n\nAnother crucial change is the introduction of two extra buttons on the iPhone 16 Pro that replace the mute switch on the iPhone 14 Pro. The Action button has already become a favorite of folks for folks looking to execute tasks or even shortcuts with the press of a button.\n\nThis year, we also get the Camera Control, a physical button with a capacitive side to it. It\u2019s a camera shutter in spirit, but can do a lot more. Using slide gestures, it can also handle adjustments like ISO or zoom level, among other camera controls.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: camera\n\nFor users deep into video capture and engaged in professional workflows, the latest from Apple offers plenty. Both phones rely on a mostly identical 48-megapixel main camera and a 12MP zoom camera, but the iPhone 16 Pro takes things up a notch by upgrading the 12MP ultrawide lens to a 48MP sensor.\n\nAnother crucial upgrade is the inherent zoom architecture. The iPhone 14 Pro has a 3x optical range using a lens tunnel system for zooming. The iPhone 16 Pro reaches a 5x optical zoom range, thanks to the tetra prism lens architecture that was first seen on the iPhone 15 Pro Max. It also jumps to the Smart HDR 5 pipeline for more effective color contrast output.\n\nOn the imaging side, the iPhone 16 Pro enables full 48MP macro capture and can also take Spatial Pictures suited for viewing on the Apple Vision Pro headset. There are also new photographic styles on the table, alongside a new pad adjustment system to achieve the exact strength of a specific style. While that sounds appealing, it\u2019s really the video capture side of things where the iPhone 16 Pro races into an altogether different league.\n\nTo start, the rear camera can now shoot 4K Dolby Vision videos at both 100 frames per second (fps) and 120 fps, and the results look incredible. Of course, for users who like more control over their video edits, the phone also opens the doors for log capture (with support for the Academy Color Encoding System), something the iPhone 14 Pro misses out on.\n\nApple has also armed the iPhone 16 Pro with four studio-quality mics, and they play a supremely important role. Apple claims they deliver more true-to-life sounds. The trick in question is audio mixing. Essentially, when you shoot a video, you can pick between directional audio presets like in-frame, studio, and cinematic. These presets let users focus on a certain audio sources in their video. The samples captured by users suggest that it works really well.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: performance and software\n\nThe biggest shift between the iPhone 14 Pro and its 16-series counterpart is the processor, which not only stands out based on hardware merits, but also opens the doors for an entirely new software experience courtesy of Apple Intelligence.\n\nNow, depending on how excited you are about AI, you may or may not make an upgrade choice, but here\u2019s the lowdown. The A16 Bionic in the iPhone 14 Pro is based on TSMC\u2019s 4nm process, and it serves a six-core CPU and a five-core graphics engine. The iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s A18 Pro, built atop the newer 3nm node, packs six graphics cores.\n\nThe lift in processing firepower stands at 30%, while the GPU performance is improved by 40% this time around. Even compared to the mighty A17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro, Apple is touting a two-fold gain in hardware-accelerated ray tracing performance in games. It\u2019s just that there are only a handful of games out there that can push ray tracing on the new and improved flagship iPhone.\n\nNow, both iPhones have already received the iOS 18 update, but the experience is going to be quite different. The biggest upgrade is Siri interactions, which are not only a lot more natural, but also dig deeper into apps for seamless integration to get work done. It can even handle multimedia content editing using voice commands.\n\nThat means not only can Siri more efficiently perform tasks across different apps (both in-house and third-party), but it can also look into the details stored by these apps and accordingly respond to user queries. Additionally, when it can\u2019t handle certain queries, they will be offloaded to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack. The Notes app gets Writing Tools that let you handle rewrites, corrections, formatting, and summarization with a single click. AI smarts have also been extended to the Mail app, where they enable email summarization as well as smart reply suggestions.\n\nApp notifications are also intelligently brought together, summarized, and passed through focus filters. It works really well, though the system takes a few days to assess the app interaction habit before it can fine-tune the notification behavior. Another cool perk is automatic transcription and voice notes that can also be summarized with a single click.\n\nOn the more fun side of things, users will be able to convert rough sketches into beautiful drawings with a simple highlight and selection gesture. The Image Playground feature brings text-to-image facility across different places, including Messages.\n\nAlso, for users who often run into the need to look up Apple\u2019s product guides online, Siri will save them a browser trip, as the virtual assistant has ingested those guides and will offer step-by-step instructions right in the dialog box. Another cool upgrade is Screen Awareness, which lets the AI assistant take a peek at the onscreen content and answer contextual queries.\n\nApple Intelligence really is a big difference here \u2014 but it\u2019s worth remembering that Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t available yet, even on iOS 18. Instead, it will launch with iOS 18.1.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: battery and charging\n\nOne of the most notable quality-of-life upgrades offered by the iPhone 16 Pro is improved mileage, as well as faster charging. The iPhone 16 Pro is claimed to last for 27 hours of video playback on a single charge, while the iPhone 14 Pro could only manage 23 hours. That translated into a single day of charge in the iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s real-life use, but we won\u2019t know if the iPhone 16 Pro can meet or exceed this until we\u2019ve had time with it.\n\nAccording to regulatory data, the iPhone 16 Pro can technically reach a wired charging pace of 45 watts, which is dramatically faster than the iPhone 14 Pro. Additionally, the Qi wireless charging pace has reached 15W, up from 7.5W on the iPhone 15 Pro.\n\nApple has also boosted the MagSafe output for its latest flagship. The iPhone 16 Pro can reach a MagSafe power delivery peak of 25W when paired with a 30W brick, while the iPhone 14 Pro could only muster 15W for juicing up the lithium-ion unit packed inside its glass-metal chassis.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs iPhone 14 Pro: availability and price\n\nThe Apple iPhone 16 Pro is now available for sale. The base model of the phone will set you back $999, with more storage costing more and rising all the way to a 1TB option. The Apple iPhone 14 Pro is similar, with the same storage options and an initial starting price of $999.\n\nHowever, given the latter\u2019s older age, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll find the iPhone 14 Pro at a much lower price than the newer flagship. During sales periods, it could be significantly so, making it a much more attractive option to those looking for a bargain.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: should you upgrade?\n\nThe Apple iPhone 16 Pro, as mentioned above, is pushing the envelope with both software- and hardware-side innovations. But that also begs the question \u2014 is the iPhone 14 Pro a laggard that demands an upgrade just two years into its product life?\n\nWell, the answer depends on how much utility you are going to get out of the exclusive iPhone 16 Pro perks.\n\nThe biggest differentiator, of course, is Apple Intelligence. The AI-driven overhaul of iOS 18 puts Siri and next-gen machine learning capabilities into every corner of the iPhone\u2019s software. And over time, those AI conversations \u2014 especially Siri integrations \u2014 will appear inside third-party apps, as well. Ultimately, it will boil down to how much one has grown weary of the boring iOS experience and seeks to experience what a next-generation AI-driven experience feels like.\n\nThen we have the camera chops. Now, the iPhone is still one of the nicest smartphone camera systems out there, and that applies to the iPhone 14 Pro as much as the iPhone 16 Pro. Is the newer phone better? Yes. Is it a big enough gulf that you\u2019ll feel like the older phone is missing out? That\u2019s less likely.\n\nHowever, if you intend to push your phone in terms of ultrawide capture and, more importantly, videos that try to challenge a DSLR, the enhanced zoom and high-fps Dolby Vision perks will really light up a social media feed with stunning samples.\n\nNow, Apple has kept the asking price the same, which is great news and makes the upgrade even more compelling. For those who can score a good trade-in deal, and can absorb the deficit hit on their wallet, the iPhone 16 Pro is absolutely worth the jump. For the rest, the iPhone 14 Pro is still enough to last at least another year, or two, with ease."
