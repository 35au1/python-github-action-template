        "article_content": "There are many reasons that creating a video game can take a long time. It may take a while to land on the mechanics, or to nail the story beats. For big-budget games, the sheer scale of ambition and world building can cause development cycles nearly a decade long, during which shifting audience trends may force a developer to scrap its initial vision.\n\nFor UFO 50, which began its development in 2016, the protracted path to completion is right there in the name: It is not just one video game, but 50.\n\nThere are arcade-style sports games (Bushido Ball, Hot Foot), platformers (Cyber Owls, Mini & Max), puzzle games (Block Koala), deck builders (Party House), role-playing games (Grimstone) and dungeon crawlers (Valbrace). While each \u201980s-style title is not necessarily feature length by modern terms, they\u2019re fully built out, with narratives, multiple levels and multiplayer modes when appropriate."

        "article_content": "Discovery in video games has changed over the last 40 years. While we are arguably in a golden age of creativity and innovation in the medium, it's a different type of creativity than when games were in their infancy--learning to crawl, grappling for new ideas, and guessing at best practices. Modern-day games have become largely standardized, and that's mostly for the better. But when we look back at retro game collections like the NES Classic or compilations from Digital Eclipse, we're often remembering the trailblazers, not the oddballs. That's what makes UFO 50 so special--it invokes the sense of wild experimentation and surprise that you would find in a cross-section of the earliest video games.\n\nThe pitch is simple: UFO 50 is a compilation of fictional retro games made throughout the 1980s by a prolific developer called UFO Soft. They range from 1982 to 1989, and span across the entire gamut of retro genres. The presentation leans into this, as selecting a game for the first time has you blowing the dust off of it. You get the sense that you discovered these forgotten gems in an attic or garage sale. And for the most part, the games carry the design and story aesthetic that was common in '80s games, which I would describe as \"sci-fi pulp as reimagined by early computer programmers.\"\n\nIn reality, of course, the games were created by a team of modern-day developers led by Spelunky's Derek Yu. That makes the decision to make not just a retro game but 50 retro games remarkably ambitious. One would expect such a massive undertaking to result in minigames at most, but that is not the case. These are almost universally the size and scope of actual games you would buy in the 1980s--still often smaller than the games we'd expect today, but not compromised for their fictional time period.\n\nThe character-select screen in Fist Hell\n\nGallery\n\nAnd while UFO 50 doesn't tell a straightforward narrative story, there is a lot of richness to be found in the meta-fiction of UFO Soft. You see the logo changing over time. The games themselves get more complex and more refined, and have better art direction and better quality-of-life features, over the fictional timeline. The games themselves have little notes about their development, and you can piece together criss-crossing plotlines involving the studio's personalities and leadership. The occasional sequel will appear, showing an early style of iterative development that might result in radically different gameplay styles springing from the same core concepts. One of the games--a point-and-click adventure called Night Manor--has glimpses of the early cinematic achievement that you could see being influential in the fiction of the world.\n\nLike a lot of early games, the simplicity of the controls means you more-or-less figure out the game by playing. This can be slightly frustrating sometimes, especially when a game ventures into territory with more complex, board game-like mechanics, like Devilition. Others, like Mooncat, have strange and counterintuitive controls that I struggled to get a proper feel for. This is realistic in that a lot of old video games tried to approximate board-game complexity or experiment with control schemes, but the wealth of other games to play made it difficult to remain patient with those more inscrutable ones.\n\nDespite basing themselves around retro games, though, most of these have some special twist or feature that makes them stand out from similar games of their genre. You can mark a game as a favorite for easy reference later, and as I reached further and the games grew more refined, I kept marking more and more of them, eager to go back and experience them all to their fullest. And while UFO 50 is very casual in how it lets you approach the games in any order, there is a reward for delving deeply into each one--you get rewards to place in your garden for an achievement in each game, along with a golden cartridge for finishing it.\n\nTo give a taste, here are mini-reviews of some of my favorites in the compilation:\n\nMortol\n\nThis puzzle platformer gives you an array of peons willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good, making your resources and lives draw from the same large pool. Each one can perform a \"ritual\" to stick into walls, turn into a stone block, or blow up passages, so you progress through the stage by carefully managing when and how to sacrifice them to keep progressing further. It was followed by a sequel, Mortol II, later in the collection, which includes a more sophisticated class-based system for utilizing your willing sacrifices, but there's something very pure and engaging about the original idea.\n\nBushido Ball\n\nA dodgeball-meets-fighting game with a selection of samurai characters to choose from. You smack the projectiles with your katana to ricochet it back at the other side, and on top of requiring precision timing, each character has their own special abilities, providing lots of replay value and room for skill-building.\n\nCamouflage\n\nCamouflage is a brilliant little puzzle game with a root in stealth mechanics. As a largely helpless chameleon, you need to navigate to your home while avoiding watchful predators. But being a chameleon, you can change your colors to match the tile you're standing on. That makes navigating through a stage a tense exercise in planning your route to pick up new camouflage patterns. For extra challenge, each stage has collectibles to pick up, including a baby chameleon who will follow you around and pick up its own camouflage pattern, thus doubling the challenge.\n\nParty House\n\nPossibly my favorite surprise of the bunch, Party House is an ingenious puzzle game with mechanics similar to modern deck-builders. You're given a strict number of turns to throw a series of parties, and you control the guest list. Each guest comes with bonuses to your cash and popularity--cash expands your house, and popularity goes toward inviting new guests. Some guests have \"Troublemaker\" attributes that will attract the cops, while others might sacrifice some popularity for cash, or vice-versa. Dancers stack as a multiplier for popularity. One party-goer even brings a random friend who risks overloading your party and summoning the fire marshall to kick someone out.\n\nThe party commences, a random assortment of your rolodex of party-goers shows up, and you tabulate your cash and popularity to put toward the next party, all while steering toward some particular win condition like having four aliens attend a single party. It's shockingly compelling, and easy to keep the party going for just one more turn late into the night.\n\nThe cops break up the party in Party House\n\nThe Big Bell Race\n\nThe is one of the shortest games of the collection but also one most suited to multiplayer. The Big Bell Race is pure game mechanics: You're a spaceship navigating through a boxy maze-like racetrack while bouncing off the other racing ships and grabbing power-ups that create track hazards for your competitors. A single tournament is eight quick races, but the competition can be fierce, and you can always play two-player to bump elbows against a friend.\n\nWarptank\n\nAt first glance, Warptank appears similar to the classic Blaster Master tank segments, but it's the \"warp\" in the name that really sets it apart. At any point, your tank can flip from floor to ceiling or to opposing walls. Navigating a stage is a delicate balance of avoiding traps and taking out enemies by frequently gaining access to new vantage points, giving it a fierce action-game feeling that also tickles your brain.\n\nVainger\n\nThis metroidvania-like platformer has a hook similar to Warptank, but the application of it in this genre makes it feel very different. As an alien soldier, you can swap the gravity polarity by double-tapping the jump button, so all of the traps and enemies are positioned to take advantage of stages that could be upside-down at any time. The result is something like the second quest of Symphony of the Night in a reversed castle, except you control when the whole thing flips on its head.\n\nThe alien protagonist of Vainger\n\nPingolf\n\nLots of early games tried to approximate sports like golf, but Pingolf is a more modern take with a sci-fi aesthetic. The side-scrolling stages are set up like platforming stages with some elements of pinball, with narrow corners and bounce pads. It feels not quite like anything else, though the closest analogue is probably the recent Cursed to Golf.\n\nFist Hell\n\nIt wouldn't be a retro-style compilation without a River City Ransom riff, but Fist Hell sets itself apart with fantastic pixel art and an engaging hook: zombies! You're taking on the hordes of the undead with nothing but your fists and found objects, which leads to neat twists like lopping the skull off of one zombie and throwing it at another. It's the kind of comical early gore that felt daring in the '80s, and with four characters to choose from, there's lots of replay value.\n\nValbrace\n\nAnother surprising favorite from a genre I haven't had much experience with, Valbrace is a first-person dungeon-crawling RPG, similar to Dungeon Master or Wizardry 2. The presentation is top-notch for emulating the peculiar, pixelated look of those dungeon crawlers, and when you encounter monsters, you enter a more active real-time third-person combat system. What really helps it stand out, though, is the magic system, which maps spells onto a particular pattern drawn with your D-pad. You discover those spells as you proceed through the dungeon, but even if you die, the spell pattern will still work on your next run. That means if you can remember the spells--or map them onto graph paper--you'll make each subsequent run that much easier.\n\nFighting goblins in Valbrace\n\nRakshasa\n\nA side-scrolling action game along the lineage of Ghosts & Goblins, this one has you taking on hordes of demons with a unique revival mechanic. You're extremely vulnerable to attacks and bound to die, but each time you die, you can recover your life by navigating around the demons of the spiritual plane. Each time you die, more demons are added, making it increasingly difficult--but not impossible--to recover your body.\n\nStar Waspir\n\nThis is less of a retro genre reimagined, and more of an anachronistic take on the bullet hell. Lots of shoot-'em-ups graced the NES and its similarly powered consoles, but Star Waspir has the tense risk-reward dynamic of populating constant power-ups that are just temptingly close to enemy fire. It's the kind of tough, responsive combat that has made the genre such a hit, given new context through a retro filter.\n\nGrimstone\n\nAn old-school JRPG-style game set in a fantastical version of the Old West, Grimstone begins as an angel rescues a handful of adventurers from a burning saloon, who then form a posse to go after outlaws. The aesthetic is reminiscent of the earliest Final Fantasy games, but its setting and a timing-based combat system gives it a modern twist.\n\nLords of Diskonia\n\nWhat if a strategy game got a dose of air hockey? Lords of Diskonia has you collect income from villages and use it to buy an army of knights, archers, champions, and more, and then take them into battle. But far from a typical warzone, your soldiers here are differently sized circular disks who get fired into and bump against enemy units to attack. It's a wildly different take on the strategy genre and feels tactical and dynamic at once.\n\nCyber Owls\n\nThe final game of the collection is also a smart, cheeky commentary on the prominence of Turtle-mania in the late '80s, and the efforts from just about every cartoon studio or video game developer to make their own franchise-friendly animals with attitude. Cyber Owls is the kind of game you'd see then, with an elite band of owl soldiers, each with their own stages to match their specialty--from beat-'em-up to stealth action. It's probably the single most varied game of the set, and one of the most cinematic, serving as a perfect bookend to the fictional journey of game development throughout the decade.\n\nSimply put, UFO 50 is an audacious triumph. Dozens of the games are compelling enough to warrant a full playthrough, and even some of the less successful experiments have some intriguing element or inventive idea to draw you in. Best of all, it's exciting to have such a rich vein of strange, creative video game experiences to examine. This is nostalgia, but not the candy-coated feeling of reliving what we've already experienced. It's remembering how it felt to discover something new."

        "article_content": "WEST PARIS \u2014 Deb Hewins was interviewed recently for \u201cCursed Echoes: Beyond the Veil,\u201d a paranormal documentary about the notorious Bridgewater Triangle.\n\nThe Bridgewater Triangle is an area about 200 square miles in southeastern Massachusetts that has had an unusually high number of reports of alleged paranormal phenomena, including unidentified flying objects, poltergeists, and other spectral events, sightings of Bigfoot-like creatures and giant snakes and birds.\n\nCryptozoologist Loren Coleman coined the term in the 1970s in the book \u201cMysterious America\u201d after researching the area and its paranormal reports.\n\nHewins, who lives in Mechanic Falls, moved to Bridgewater, Massachusetts, when she was 9 years old. The move happened shortly after a curious incident with her father in which he was unresponsive or frozen in time for several minutes while reading the newspaper one Sunday morning.\n\nHewins said her father told the family that they had to move to Bridgewater \u201cbecause God told him to.\u201d\n\nDuring the recent interview in West Paris, Hewins described her paranormal experiences and encounters, or \u201cvisits,\u201d from extraterrestrials she has experienced along with her twin sister, Audrey Hewins, as far back as they both can remember.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would tell my parents I was afraid to go to bed. I was afraid the bald men were going to get me,\u201d Hewins said. \u201cI was seeing all sorts of things behind the veil that people don\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nLiving near the Hockomock Swamp and the Freetown-Fall River State Forest, sites where many strange occurrences have been reported, only intensified the experiences that the twins were having, Hewins said during the documentary interview.\n\n\u201cWe had the Hockomock swamp pretty much in our backyard,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nShe said there are many different extraterrestrial species that she sees and communicates with, both benevolent and malevolent.\n\n\u201cAll these beings are highly intelligent,\u201d Hewins said. \u201cAnd they know everything about us because they\u2019re telepathic.\u201d\n\nShe described a battle between the dark and the light side of these beings, which she called angels and demons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHewins eventually realized how to repel the negative beings, by projecting love.\n\n\u201cEvery religion has pieces of the truth but, where they are in certain parts of the world, things are different. Things are interpreted differently,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nShe said there is a \u201cspiritual awakening\u201d happening in the world that is being helped along by extraterrestrials.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s falling apart. If somebody doesn\u2019t intervene, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cI do believe this is a global intervention and they\u2019re doing it in steps.\u201d\n\nShortly after moving to Maine in 2006, the Hewins twins founded Starborn Support, a national online support group \u201cto assist and provide emotional support to those who feel they have had an extraterrestrial encounter,\u201d according to the group\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine doing this alone. A lot of people do it. That\u2019s why I started the support group,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group hosts gatherings for \u201cexperiencers,\u201d those who report having a UFO or ET encounter.\n\nAfter the interview on Sept. 11, Hewins, filmmaker Tyler Roberts, and film producer Jess Weiner gathered with other experiencers to call on ETs to visit and then watch the sky for UFOs.\n\nThe group saw several bright floating dots that could not be readily identified, but many were suspected satellites moving across the night sky.\n\nAccording to NASA\u2019s website, UFOs can be \u201crocket launches, comets, military jets, weather balloons, sounding rockets, satellites, meteors and fireballs, experimental craft (if you are lucky) and odd clouds (such as lenticular clouds, which are lentil-shaped and resemble flying saucers).\u201d\n\nIn recent years, UFOs, or as the federal government has started referring to them, unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs, have gained mainstream attention with hearings held before the U.S. Congress.\n\nFilmmaker Roberts grew up in Billerica, which is a part of the triangle and home to what he referred to as the \u201cmost haunted road in Massachusetts.\u201d He feels like he is meant to tell the story he is crafting in his first feature-length film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe more I think the world is black and white, the more gray I see,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nHe also traveled to Bridgewater and Salem, Massachusetts, where he encountered many synchronicities which led him to Hewins.\n\n\u201cThese are things I\u2019m running into, and I can\u2019t ignore them,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s slapping me in the face over and over again, saying \u2018tell the story.\u2019\u201d\n\nRoberts hosts a podcast, \u201cTotal Disclosure,\u201d in which he interviews people about UFOs and cover-up conspiracies, including credible sources like retired federal government officials.\n\nThere is a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for post-production expenses on Roberts\u2019 self-funded documentary. The trailer is expected to be released in October, just in time for \u201cspooky season,\u201d he said."

Here's an excerpt from his new novella, \"In the Valley of the Headless Men.\"\n\nThe red silk scarf my mother wore countless times in life felt like mummy wrappings between my fingers. This could not have been hers. She never wore it. Her death made every memory of her feel like a lie, like a misremembered scene from a movie. The air in her room smelled different, the essence of her coming and going, of her favorite eucalyptus shampoo purged by a breeze through an open window. The lace curtains fluttered. They were not her curtains. They never were.\n\nSan Antonio horror novelist Celso Hurtado. Courtesy Celso Hurtado\n\nSan Antonio native Hurtado got praise from NPR for his 2021 young-adult horror novel, \"The Ghost Tracks,\" a teen/tween spin on the legend of the ghost children said to push your car over a railroad crossing in the city's South Side. The International Latino Book Award-winning book introduced Erasmo Cruz, a 17-year-old whose father overdosed and whose mother left him to live with his ailing grandmother. To help his abuela, Erasmo sets up a supernatural detective agency in San Antonio as a paranormal investigator.\n\nErasmo's adventures continue in the 2023 sequel, \"The Devil's Promise.\" Yet it's the provided excerpt from \"The Ghost Tracks\" that still clings to the author.\n\nIt was then that Erasmo felt tiny, probing fingers on his body. At first they were hesitant, as if doubtful of his tangibility. But then they suddenly hardened, and he could feel the unnatural strength behind the miniature grips that took hold of him. His body jerked forward, the asphalt scraping against his skin.\n\nCould this actually be happening? Even as Erasmo felt himself being dragged along the tracks, he wasn\u2019t entirely sure. But then children\u2019s voices \u2014 gentle and lyrical \u2014 whispered all around him. The words flowed together, a tapestry of soothing intonations. Listening to them, he knew: This was real.\n\nKevin L. Williams\n\nSan Antonio horror writer Kevin L. Williams. Courtesy Kevin L.

Here's a token of that \"Love.\"\n\nSome in this world would consider me a monster \u2014 they would be right. I have done monstrous things that I will be called to account for when the afterlife harkens. At that time, I will stand ready; until then I attempt to take stock of the events of my existence as much as I am able. As I squat under a decaying tree that resembles a rabid animal with branches that whip about in the strong wind, I think about my rebirth. Overhead, lightning streaks and crackles across the night sky; the electric pulse rippling miles away even as I watch it fade.\n\n\n\nLightning.\n\n\n\nAlways the lightning.\n\nForever following me. Challenging me. Mocking me.\n\nFlashes of phantom pain trickle through my limbs; the feeling akin to what I suspect maggots crawling over my insides would feel like. The fiercer the light storm, the worse the twitching of my limbs. It is as if my entire body is a lightning rod and my nerves, receptors that harness and channel the electricity. And, in truth, this is not far afield from my creation. Electricity had given me life, but the Fiend \u2014 the False God \u2014 prevented me from having a life."

        "article_content": "For years, scientists thought they had a good grasp on what happens when a molecule of water meets air. You know, the stuff we read in textbooks? Turns out, we\u2019ve been wrong.\n\nA group of researchers discovered that the molecules at the surface of salt water organize themselves in a way that\u2019s totally different than we ever thought.\n\nDr. Yair Litman from the Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry led the team, and this revelation shakes up some long-held beliefs in climate science.\n\nIt might sound like just another science experiment, but this one has real-world implications, especially when it comes to understanding how our atmosphere works and how to mitigate human impacts on the planet.\n\nChemistry at the surface of water molecules\n\nWhen we think about where important chemical reactions happen, we might not immediately picture the surface of the ocean or a glass of salt water. But that\u2019s exactly where critical interactions take place, especially when water meets air.\n\nThink of it: the evaporation of ocean water affects our climate, drives weather patterns, and even influences the chemistry of the air we breathe. It\u2019s a big deal.\n\nFor years, the science community has been trying to get a handle on exactly what happens at that surface, particularly how ions \u2014 those tiny charged particles in salt \u2014 behave when they hang out at the water\u2019s edge.\n\nAre they neatly lined up? Do they play nice with water molecules? Well, until now, it was all pretty much guesswork. The exact behavior of ions at the water-air interface has been hotly debated.\n\nThat\u2019s where Litman\u2019s team, along with Dr. Kuo-Yang Chiang from the Max Planck Institute, comes in. Their study, published in Nature Chemistry, changes the game.\n\nBy combining cutting-edge technology with advanced simulations, they\u2019ve shown that water molecules at the surface of salt water don\u2019t behave the way we\u2019ve always thought. And yes, this is big news.\n\nLooking at the surface of water molecules\n\nThe traditional view, found in most textbooks, was simple: ions, which are either positively or negatively charged, line up at the surface and organize water molecules in one direction. But according to this new research, that\u2019s not how things work at all.\n\nThe team used a more advanced form of a technique called vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG). In the past, VSFG allowed scientists to look at molecular vibrations on the surface of water.\n\nBut it had a flaw \u2014 it couldn\u2019t tell whether these vibrations were positive or negative, which made it hard to interpret what was really going on. Kind of like trying to figure out a conversation by only hearing half of it.\n\nTrying a different technique\n\nThat\u2019s where heterodyne-detected (HD)-VSFG came into play. This technique takes things a step further, allowing the team to not only measure the vibrations but also figure out their direction.\n\nThe result? They discovered that ions at the surface of salt water don\u2019t just form a single layer and organize water molecules in one direction.\n\nInstead, ions organize water molecules both up and down, flipping the textbook model on its head.\n\n\u201cOur work demonstrates that the surface of simple electrolyte solutions has a different ion distribution than previously thought,\u201d Litman explained.\n\n\u201cAt the very top, there are a few layers of pure water, followed by an ion-rich layer, and then the bulk salt solution.\u201d\n\nThis means that, rather than ions neatly lining up and orienting water molecules in one direction, they create a much more complex and dynamic environment.\n\nIt\u2019s like discovering that your once-quiet neighborhood is actually buzzing with activity behind closed doors.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking, \u201cOkay, but why should I care how ions behave at the surface of water?\u201d The answer lies in how this discovery affects atmospheric science.\n\nThe surface of water \u2014 especially ocean water \u2014 is where a lot of important reactions take place. Evaporation, cloud formation, and even how pollutants break down in the atmosphere all hinge on these water-air interfaces.\n\nWhen we don\u2019t fully understand how ions behave at the water\u2019s surface, we can\u2019t make accurate models for climate science. And in a world where understanding climate is crucial, having an accurate model is everything.\n\nDr. Kuo-Yang Chiang from the Max Planck Institute adds that this research not only deepens our understanding of liquid interfaces but could also be applied to other fields.\n\n\u201cThis paper shows that combining high-level HD-VSFG with simulations is an invaluable tool that will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of liquid interfaces.\u201d\n\nIn other words, this important revelation could help scientists develop better technologies for things like batteries and energy storage.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe it\u2019ll even help us better understand how to manage some of the environmental issues we\u2019re facing today.\n\nTechnique has far-reaching applications\n\nThe implications of this study don\u2019t stop at atmospheric science. Mischa Bonn, head of the Molecular Spectroscopy department at the Max Planck Institute, believes that this discovery could pave the way for a deeper understanding of other interfaces, like those found in batteries.\n\n\u201cThese types of interfaces occur everywhere on the planet, so studying them not only helps our fundamental understanding but can also lead to better devices and technologies,\u201d Bonn explained.\n\nIf we can get a better grip on how molecules behave on the surface of salt water, it could improve our understanding of how they behave on the surface of a solid material, too. That\u2019s huge for anyone working on improving batteries or other energy storage solutions.\n\nThis is one of those discoveries where the impact might not be immediately obvious, but down the road, it could change everything \u2014 from how we build devices to how we think about climate science.\n\nApplications of this water molecule discovery\n\nTo sum it all up, the findings from Dr. Litman\u2019s team are just the beginning. Their discovery challenges decades of assumptions about water and ions, and it opens the door to a whole new area of research.\n\nThe next steps? Applying these techniques to even more complex systems, like the interactions between water and solids, which could help us understand everything from pollution to clean energy.\n\nIt\u2019s rare that a scientific discovery completely rewrites what we thought we knew. But when it does, it\u2019s a reminder that science is always evolving.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Nature Chemistry.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

        "article_content": "The University of Texas at Austin has been chosen to lead a new institute that harnesses artificial intelligence to explore some of the leading mysteries of the universe, including dark matter and the fundamentals related to the search for life. Housed in UT\u2019s Oden Institute for Computational Sciences and Engineering, the NSF-Simons AI Institute for Cosmic Origins will be funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Simons Foundation. Its mission is to develop AI technologies for astronomical research to advance our understanding of the cosmos and accelerate the pace of new scientific discoveries.\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting opportunity to advance our understanding and help answer some of the most fundamental questions about the universe. As part of our campus, NSF-Simons CosmicAI will drive discovery using AI, enabled by an incredible set of talented people and the largest GPU cluster in all of academia. And, through the Oden Institute, it will collaborate with eight scientific domains that are among the best in the country,\u201d said UT President Jay Hartzell. \u201cAs astronomical data tend to be public and nonproprietary, CosmicAI aligns with our University\u2019s mission to use open AI as an enabler for the public good. We are grateful for our partnership with NSF and the Simons Foundation to launch this institute.\u201d\n\nCosmicAI, which further advances UT\u2019s \u201cYear of AI\u201d initiative, will unite an interdisciplinary group of faculty members and researchers under one umbrella to expand AI innovation in astronomy. It will span eight departments with more than 17 faculty members in the areas of astronomy, computer science, statistics and data science, linguistics, information sciences, math, mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering.\n\n\u201cBy building next-generation AI tools, the institute will accelerate discoveries related to the most basic human question: \u2018Where do we come from?\u2019 The CosmicAI research will investigate the origins of the universe including the formation of galaxies, stars, planets and even the building blocks for life,\u201d said Stella Offner, director of the new institute. Offner is an associate professor of astronomy in the College of Natural Sciences and co-director of the Center for Scientific Machine Learning at the Oden Institute.\n\nCosmicAI will develop AI approaches to efficiently process large astronomical datasets, explore the nature of dark matter and model prebiotic molecules that are key to life in the universe. The institute also plans to democratize access to astronomical data by developing a powerful AI-based astronomy \u201cco-pilot\u201d to streamline the scientific method in astrophysics and assist researchers with visualizing data, producing statistical analyses, understanding the scientific literature and more.\n\n\u201cThe Oden Institute is thrilled to provide an interdisciplinary home for CosmicAI. It has been particularly exciting to see cross-campus collisions taking place and laying foundations for this exciting new effort,\u201d said Karen Willcox, director of the Oden Institute.\n\nWith a goal to make AI training and methods accessible to all, the grant includes extensive education and outreach components to help train the AI-literate workforce of tomorrow. From multitiered programs to engage high school students with astronomy data, to research training for undergraduates, to graduate-level courses offered through an AI-astronomy certificate-type program, CosmicAI will build opportunities through reducing barriers, lowering costs and expanding online opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, CosmicAI will leverage the resources of the Texas Advanced Computing Center to launch a data platform that hosts large astronomical datasets within an AI-enabled analysis. The data platform will serve as a nexus for community calculations and collaboration.\n\nThe new institute will be co-directed by Matthew Lease, professor in UT\u2019s School of Information and an expert in AI modeling and human-computer interaction.

        "article_content": "It may be the very definition of a creepy crawly, but this species of giant millipede was a major discovery for a recent scientific expedition to Madagascar.\n\nNot seen in 126 years, it was part of a bevy of species identified by scientists among the trees and waterfalls in a remote section of the largest forest on the island, called Makira.\n\nThe expedition was part of Re:wild\u2019s Search for Lost Species program, on the progress of which GNN has reported substantially over the last four years. It included teams of scientists and conservationists from 4 different organizations, as well as local guides.\n\nDifferent specialized team members were searching for mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates that have not had a documented sighting in at least a decade or more, but are not assessed as extinct by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The full team, which numbered more than 30 people, searched Makira for several weeks in September 2023 and spent several months analyzing their results.\n\n\u201cIn the past the Search for Lost Species has primarily looked for one or two species on each expedition, but there are now 4,300 species that we know of around the world that have not been documented in a decade or more,\u201d said Christina Biggs, lost species officer for Re:wild, whose eDNA work during the expedition detected 37 additional vertebrate species that the taxonomic experts didn\u2019t sight.\n\n\u201cMadagascar is a biodiversity hotspot and Makira is an underexplored area within the country, so we decided to pilot a new model for lost species searches there. We convened a group of scientists to search for as many species as possible, and it proved successful.\u201d\n\nThe expedition team initially had a list of 30 lost species they were hoping to find in Makira. The species on the list included 3 mammals, 3 fish, 7 reptiles, 12 insects, and 5 spiders. With the help of local guides and fishermen, the team found the 3 fish species on the list highlighted by the Makira rainbow fish, not seen in 20 years.\n\n\u201cWhen we didn\u2019t find anything during the first five days of the expedition it was very frustrating,\u201d said Tsilavina Ravelomanana, fish biologist at Antananarivo University, who had been to Makira 20 years earlier to survey freshwater fish. \u201cWe sampled a small tributary of the Antainambalana River, then the main river, then upstream, and then downstream, but we still didn\u2019t find any fish.\u201d\n\nTwo of the expedition\u2019s local guides, Melixon and Edm\u00e9, hiked around a steep waterfall and over mountains to villages that were within a few days\u2019 walk of the expedition\u2019s base camp along the Antainambalana River. After several days, the guides were able to find a Makira rainbow fish, a common fish to local communities, and brought it back to the camp in a bucket of water.\n\nThe semi-translucent fish is only a few inches long. The guides were also able to find Ptychoromis makira, which biologists think may only live in one small area near Andaparaty, and is a rare species\u2014even to local communities.\n\nMakira proved to be home to several lost species of insects including bugs and some that were not even on the initial list of lost species for the area. Entomologists found two different species of ant-like flower beetles that had been lost to science since 1958. However, the most unexpected rediscovered lost species was a giant, dark brown millipede.\n\nA SIMILAR EXPEDITION TO CHILE: Mushroom Enthusiasts Help Find Species Lost to Science\u2013Rescuing it from Nature\u2019s \u2018Top 25 Most Wanted\u2019 List\n\n\u201cI personally was most surprised and pleased by the fact that the giant millipede Spirostreptus sculptus, not uncommon in Makira Forest, appeared to be another lost species known only from the type specimen described in 1897,\u201d said Dmitry Telnov, an entomologist on the expedition team. \u201cThe longest specimen of this species we observed in Makira was a really gigantic female measuring 27.5 centimeters [10.8 inches] long.\u201d\n\nThe expedition team also found a variety of spider species in Makira, including five jumping spiders that were lost to science and 17 spiders that are new to science. The longest-lost spider was the jumping spider Tomocyrba decollata, which had not had a documented sighting since 1900, when it was first described by science.\n\nThe most unexpected discovery was a new species of zebra spider. One evening a hanging egg sac in the entrance of a small cave caught the eye of one of the team members.\n\n\u201cI immediately recognized them as something special,\u201d said Brogan Pett, director of the SpiDiverse working group at the Biodiversity Inventory for Conservation and doctoral candidate at the University of Exeter.\n\nMADAGASCAR CONSERVATION: Reforestation is Difficult: But Local Farmers of NGO Green Again Madagascar Are on Top of It\n\n\u201cPendulous egg sacs are one of the characteristics of the family of zebra spiders this new species belongs to. I crawled a short way inside the cave and saw a few adult spiders guarding egg sacs\u2014they were quite large spiders and it was remarkable that they had gone unrecognized for so long.\u201d\n\nAlthough the expedition found nearly two dozen lost species, there were several that the expedition team was unable to find including the Masoala fork-marked lemur; a large chameleon, Calumma vatososa, meaning \u201cbeautiful stone\u201d in Malagasy, and the recently rediscovered dusky tetraka. The lemur has not had a documented sighting since 2004 and the chameleon since 2006.\n\nThe dusky tetraka was rediscovered by the Search for Lost Birds in Madagascar in December 2022 and January 2023 in two different locations in Andapa and Masoala. Makira is between these sites, and ornithologists were hoping to determine if the species also lives there. They were unable to find any of the cryptic olive and yellow birds during the expedition, but they are not ready to rule out the forest as a habitat for the species yet.\n\nMORE RESULTS FROM RE:WILD: Long-Beaked Creature Is Proven Not Extinct in First Ever Photos: \u2018Blows My Mind\u2019 After 60 Years\n\n\u201cThe Makira Forest has the potential for two rare bird species, the dusky tetraka, and the Madagascar serpent eagle, but we were not able to find them this time,\u201d said Lily Arison Rene de Roland, Madagascar program director for the Peregrine Fund, another organization that joined the expedition.\n\nMadagascar has one of the highest rates of endemism of anywhere on planet Earth. For millions of years, plants and animals have evolved in seclusion\u2014creating unique ecosystems that don\u2019t exist anywhere else.\n\nSHARE These Hidden Natural Wonders Of Evolution With Your Friends\u2026"

(Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nKarat\u2019s annual survey of software leaders signals an uptick in tech hiring and shows differentiation for companies that are accelerating interview scheduling, working with talent evaluation partners, and centralizing the hiring process\n\nSEATTLE, September 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Karat, the world\u2019s most trusted talent evaluation partner, released its fourth annual Tech Hiring Trends report today. The report reveals improving sentiment around technical hiring and software engineering performance as forward-looking hiring targets are up across the U.S. and India compared to last year.\n\nKarat\u2019s 2024 Tech Hiring Trends report is based on a survey conducted by The Harris Poll of more than 400 software leaders. The report highlights the shifting talent landscape, rising engineering quality, and talent strategies of top performing companies, featuring exclusive insights from engineering leaders at organizations including Tesla, Walmart, Deloitte, and more.\n\n\"We\u2019re in the midst of a multi-year shift in tech talent strategies, and it\u2019s encouraging to see hiring targets trending up as leaders look ahead to 2025,\" shared Jeffrey Spector, Karat co-founder and president. \"As hiring picks back up and the value of strong software engineers continues to grow, it\u2019s going to be challenging for leaders to balance the growing volume and pace of hiring with the consistency and quality controls they sought to implement over the past two years.\"\n\nDespite persistent worries about AI eliminating the need for tech workers, this year\u2019s report highlighted the growing value that strong software engineers produce for top employers, as well as the widening gap between high and lower performing organizations. 69% of top-performing engineering leaders said that a strong engineer was worth at least 3x their salary, up from 60% last year. At the same time, lower-performing leaders are seeing diminishing returns, with just 39% giving their developers a 3x valuation.\n\n\"The gap between the winners and losers of today\u2019s AI-driven tech landscape is growing. One reason for this gap is that just 68% of engineering leaders are very confident that qualified candidates are receiving job offers, but that percentage increases dramatically for top-performing leaders,\" added Spector. \"In a world where one out of every three hires aren\u2019t being made with confidence, it\u2019s important to understand how competitors are using centralized hiring processes, talent evaluation partners, and speed to win the race for top talent.\"\n\nRoles relating to the development and implementation of AI systems, including AI engineers, data analysts, and full-stack developers, were among the highest priorities for engineering leaders this year. There was also a strong correlation between organizations leveraging AI tools on the job, and satisfaction with the performance of engineering teams.\n\nStory continues\n\nReport highlights and best practices\n\nThe value strong engineers create is growing: Top Performing engineering leaders estimate a higher ROI from their engineering teams. Global competition is heating up: Hiring targets are growing. While engineering leaders are finding it easier to identify and hire software engineers in the United States, leaders in India are finding some aspects more challenging compared to last year. Top Performing companies are more likely to be leveraging AI tools on the job and believe that these tools can make their engineers and the hiring process more efficient. Best practices: Moving fast, interviewing more candidates at each stage, and centralizing the hiring process are all strategies that help companies hire with confidence.\n\nTo download the full report, visit https://karat.com/resource/tech-hiring-trends/.\n\nAbout Karat\n\nKarat makes it easy to hire great engineers.
