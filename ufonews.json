            "article_content": "The internet has been left divided over an 'egg-shaped craft' recorded during a UAP retrieval operation after the video was aired on TV for the first time.\n\nNewsNation aired the footage that 'clearly showed' the object dangling in a sling from a helicopter on Saturday night.\n\nThe alleged craft was about 20ft long and resembled the UAP encountered by the Navy off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects, NewsNation reported.\n\nIt was pointed out in the video that the object had no markings, being 'perfectly smooth', and no 'visible' means of propulsion or way to look inside.\n\nAfter the segment aired, Redditors had mixed opinions on the footage's veracity, although many were impressed by what they saw.\n\n'This is pretty cool. I don\u2019t know what you guys were expecting of a nighttime retrieval. This is actually more clear than I thought it would be. It helps to lower expectations,' one wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'I had a feeling that the video would be somewhat ambiguous. I'm not sure this is gonna move the needle without more substantiating evidence. I think it's great, personally, but this isn't gonna convince Joe Taxpayer.'\n\n'Probably is real. But you aren\u2019t going to convince people with this. To claim this is any different from any other sketchy video already seen (outside the gimbal & go fast) is a stretch & hardly going to make anybody new sit up & take notice. Too bad,' another wrote.\n\nNewsNation aired the footage which 'clearly showed' the object dangling in a sling from a helicopter\n\nThe outlet was told the craft was about 20ft long. It's said to resemble the UAP encountered by the Navy off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects\n\nHowever, other users were much less convinced.\n\n'Well, the video quality is better than I expected, I'll give them that. The object itself? With no frame of reference to judge size, it could be an actual chicken egg as far as I can tell,' one Redditor wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'This video could not have been cheap to make with the cost of eggs these days!'\n\n'No reference to size, this could literally be a chicken egg on a string, with helicopter noises edited in,' a third added.\n\n'This shows nothing. This is not earth shattering, redefining man kind evidence they were promising,' another wrote.\n\nA fifth commented: 'I knew the footage was not going to be good. But what exactly am I looking at here? An egg on the end of a fishing rod?'\n\nOther users pointed out some potential issues with the credibility of the footage.\n\n'What kind of terrain is this supposed to be on? Something about the scaling and shadow feels off,' one questioned.\n\n'Well, the video quality is better than I expected, I'll give them that. The object itself? With no frame of reference to judge size, it could be an actual chicken egg as far as I can tell,' one user wrote\n\nAnother eagle-eyed user said: 'If this was in the desert how is the helicopter not blowing up dust and sand like crazy.'\n\n'So, like, wouldn't they drop off the egg thing on a truck or something or a base? Why are they dropping it off on the ground of what appears an empty desert field?' another wrote.\n\n'No prop wash? I could fake this in my house right now in an hour,' a Redditor added.\n\nAnother user replied by pointing out the lack of sway in the rope.\n\n'So, they retrieved and filmed just an egg-shaped thing. It wasn't flying, it wasn't doing anything. What a load of utter nonsense this is,' one user said.\n\nThe video, which was kept in the dark until its bombshell release, is the latest video footage that has made the rounds online in recent weeks seemingly depicting a UFO.\n\nWidespread interest and coverage of the subject surged after drones were seen flying across New Jersey last month.\n\nOffering a solution to the mystery, Tucker Carlson made a shocking claim that the mysterious drones were controlled by a Chinese mothership satellite.\n\nTucker Carlson discussed the mysterious drones on his show this week, saying he was told the objects were controlled by China\n\nThe White House repeatedly stated that the drone sightings are not a foreign adversary, pose no threat and are not part of a US military operation\n\nThe first sightings appeared over the Picatinny Arsenal in Rockaway and President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster in November, followed by thousands more in the skies.\n\nWhile the US government was quick to dismiss claims they were foreign adversaries, Carlson claimed he was told otherwise.\n\nHe said, 'an intel person' told him that the drones 'were in fact Chinese,' explaining the US government took down a Chinese satellite 'that was a command and control satellite for these drones.'\n\nCarlson appeared to be hinting at a Beijing-operated satellite known as GaoJing 1-02 which fell from space on December 21.\n\nAstronomers tracking such devices confirmed the Chinese satellite re-entered Earth's atmosphere above New Orleans and headed north towards Mississippi, Arkansas and Missouri before burning up in the atmosphere.\n\nBut Carlson claimed it was 'taken down by the US government.'\n\nHe made the claims while speaking with independent journalist Michael Shellenberger, who heard a similar explanation for the drones.\n\n'Somebody told me that that the military got one of the orbs, opened it up and it was Chinese,' Shellenberger said.\n\nThe White House repeatedly stated that the drone sightings - which coincidentally began on November 18 - are not a foreign adversary, pose no threat and are not part of a US military operation.\n\nBut Carlson said his inside source told him that 'the belief was the Chinese government was sending the following message, 'We're moving on Taiwan.''"

According to a new report with NewsNation, U.S. Air Force veteran and whistleblower Jake Barber claims he was contracted as a helicopter pilot to retrieve downed craft.\n\nIn the report, he\u2019s sharing a video and claiming that he has retrieved nonhuman vehicles that seem to go against all physics. That or it\u2019s Mork from Mork and Mindy in his giant egg rolling on the ground under a tarp. You be the judge.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\n\u201cI saw an egg, a white egg,\u201d Barber said to the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s inconsistent with anything I\u2019d ever seen before. I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.\n\nPlay video\n\n\u201cOver the last couple years, it\u2019s been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP task force that what we were working with that night was, in fact, NHI (nonhuman intelligence) and it was not a unique experience,\u201d they added.\n\nThe report was touted by musician, filmmaker and all-around talented guy Flying Lotus on Twitter. Setting the tone for how people might be absorbing these new revelations.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s the big day huh? Lets see,\u201d he wrote alongside an alien and UFO emoji. \u201cI hear we will see \u2018paradigm shifting\u2019 evidence of a UFO crash retrieval today for the first time from a first hand witness.\u201d\n\nThis is only the latest revelation out of the disclosure we\u2019ve seen in recent years. The end of 2024 into the new year saw plenty of questions about drones across multiple areas on the East Coast. We\u2019ve also heard about the \u201cnonhuman\u201d intelligence during the Congressional testimony from the likes of Lue Elizondo and David Grusch.\n\nIf this turns out to be a Robin Williams clone gone awry, I might just have to hang it up. Life will have officially drifted into being a Family Guy gag."

            "article_content": "Ready to have a close encounter of the Steven Spielberg kind?\n\nThe acclaimed director is filming his upcoming UFO movie in New Jersey.\n\nThe film, starring Oscar nominee Emily Blunt (\u201dOppenheimer\u201d), is in need of Jersey people for background actors.\n\nNew York\u2019s Grant Wilfley Casting tells NJ Advance Media that the production is holding an open casting call for Cape May locals to play train passengers and car drivers (see more below).\n\nThe filming will take place in March \u2014 not long off from Jersey\u2019s brush with drone and/or plane-related, supposedly \u201cunidentified\u201d flying objects at the end of 2024.\n\nThe movie, which is as yet untitled \u2014 but reportedly (tentatively) titled \u201cThe Dish\u201d \u2014 also stars Emmy winner Josh O\u2019Connor (\u201dThe Crown,\u201d \u201cChallengers,\u201d \u201cLa Chimera\u201d), Oscar nominee Colman Domingo (\u201dRustin,\u201d \u201cSing Sing\u201d), Oscar winner Colin Firth (\u201dThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary\u201d) and Eve Hewson (\u201dBad Sisters\u201d).\n\nUniversal Pictures and Spielberg\u2019s Amblin are producing the film, penned by \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d and \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d screenwriter David Koepp.\n\nThe movie has been pegged to a May 15, 2026 release date.\n\nJosh O'Connor, Colman Domingo, Eve Hewson and Colin Firth will also star in the upcoming Spielberg movie, due out May 2026.Theo Wargo | Getty Images; Gilbert Flores | GG2025 | Penske Media via Getty Images; Stefanie Keenan | WireImage; Michael Tran | AFP via Getty Images\n\nOf course, aliens and UFOs are some of Spielberg\u2019s most prominent material. The Oscar-winning director famously helmed \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d (1977), \u201cE.T.\u201d (1982) and \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d (2005), which also filmed in New Jersey.\n\nSpielberg, 78, spent some of his youngest years as a child living in New Jersey with his family, as depicted in his film \u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d (2022). He most recently filmed in Jersey, largely in Paterson, for his take on \u201cWest Side Story\u201d (2021) starring Clifton\u2019s Rachel Zegler.\n\nThe Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet-Bob Dylan movie \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d directed by James Mangold, also filmed in Cape May this past spring.\n\nHere are the details for the casting call:\n\nThe Spielberg production, code name \u201cNon-View,\u201d needs extras to play car drivers and train station passengers. Applicants must be at least 18, no previous acting experience necessary.\n\nFilming will tentatively take place Monday, March 10 through Friday, March 14 in Cape May. The base pay rate is $216 per day (eight hours) and the car allowance is $37.50.\n\nTo be considered for the film, send Grant Wilfley Casting an email \u2014 address nj@gwcnyc.com. Use the subject line \u201cNon-View Cape May Locals\u201d and include this information:\n\nYour name, pronouns, phone number, whether or not you are a SAG-AFTRA member, what dates you are available during the filming window, whether or not you have visible tattoos and whether or not you are local to Cape May. Include current non-professional photos of yourself, both close-up and full-body. If you own a car that you can use in the film, also send the color, year, make and model and a photo of the car."

            "source": "Daily Express",
            "article_content": "Hi-Res music can be an expensive but worthwhile hobby.\n\nListening to music in 2025 usually means subscribing to a streaming service such as Spotify or Apple Music. The days of paying \u00a310 or more for albums on vinyl records, tape cassettes or CDs seems long gone for most of us as millions have flocked to the convenience and affordability of paying a little more than that per month for a connected service that puts the history of recorded popular music at your fingertips. As a lover and consumer of music, this for many years has felt to me like a godsend. I am aware it actively hurts the musicians but as a fan, it\u2019s amazing that I can play Spotify each month and listen to Led Zeppelin\u2019s back catalogue, find obscure Fiona Apple b-sides and even hit play on brand new releases the very day they are released for no additional fee. But I have noticed this immediate and easy access to Every Song Ever has had an adverse effect on my musical discovery and enjoyment. I spent my teenage years saving up paper round money to head to my local music shop every Monday to buy an album often based entirely on the cover art. This is how I discovered music that has shaped my tastes, from finding Nirvana\u2019s In Utero to The Black Key\u2019s Magic Potion via Manic Street Preacher\u2019s The Holy Bible. Along with obsessively reading the NME, music was a mysterious world to discover. All you had to do was make the effort - and spend some money. Nowadays, Spotify is relatively affordable but has destroyed my curiosity with its algorithmic playlists, Smart Shuffle suggestions and curated home page that either push me to music I don\u2019t like or music I know like the back of my hand. There must surely be another way to recapture the joy of music without reverting back to buying vinyl records. Though I love collecting them, their price has increased in recent years to the point of making collecting unviable for me, and they no longer come with free download codes for the digital copy.\n\nThe Activo P1 is an entry-level Hi-Res digital audio player (DAP)\n\nSo, a couple of years ago, I bought a Sony Walkman. Not one that plays tapes or CDs, but a digital music player. Sony still makes these MP3-playing touchscreen devices that should be thought of as a modern iPod Touch. The one I bought, the NW-A55, is solely for music files. This means you can only load bought music onto it via a cable just like we used to do in 2005. I persevered and found a lot of contentment in carrying around a dedicated audio player, buying copies of treasured albums to listen to in high-resolution (Hi-Res) formats such as WAV and FLAC that sound amazing through decent headphones. As you can tell from the faff and acronyms, this proved a bit of a rabbit hole. Hi-Res albums can also get expensive, from about \u00a38 up to \u00a325 in my experience. But it turns out there could be a perfect halfway house. A newer Sony Walkman to mine that I tested, the Walkman NW-A306, is similar but runs on Android and can download apps like a smartphone. That means you can get specialist audio apps such as Tidal or my preferred Qobuz and stream Hi-Res music over Wi-Fi. Qobuz, which costs from \u00a312.99 per month, also lets you download tracks for offline listening, and I\u2019m a big fan. I bought some cheap IEMs - that\u2019s in-ear monitors, earphones that musicians use to record or hear their band when playing live and offer excellent audio quality - and set to it. Having your own chosen songs at your fingertips in amazing quality really spoke to me, and I was again enjoying music as an intentional pursuit rather than the homogenous habit of looping my On Repeat playlist on Spotify. A decent upgrade on the ones I got from Amazon are the Meze Audio Alba, a fine \u00a3149 set of IEMs. A theme of my testing, the 'phones represent excellent value for money, with all Hi-Res devices I tried them with driving well balanced and expansive audio with a tangle-free cable and 3.5mm jack, plus an included USB-C dongle if you want to use them with your smartphone. A big name in the Hi-Res scene is Astell & Kern, a firm that sells dedicated DAPs (digital audio players) .The catch is they cost hundreds if not thousands of pounds, including the \u00a3799 SR35 I tried out. It sounded superb but has a chunky design and weirdly angled screen that makes it hard to use. I prefer the Activo P1 from its Activo sub-brand that costs \u00a3399. It\u2019s an excellent entry-level DAP with (slightly sluggish) Android software and great sound quality. I tested its chops with the over-ear \u00a3139 FiiO FT1 headphones that plug in via the headphone jack - Bluetooth is generally frowned upon for Hi-Res as it can never match the audio quality of a wired connection.\n\nThe FiiO FT1 pack a real punch at an affordable price.\n\nThat said, FiiO\u2019s BT11 tries to get around this. It\u2019s a USB-C dongle that plugs into a phone and can broadcast Hi-Res wirelessly at better frequencies. I tested it with both iPhone and Android and while tunes sound good in the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, there\u2019s still a distortion and hiss you just don\u2019t get on wired alternatives. The best audio quality I found while testing was running offline files through my Sony Walkman or the Activo P1 and using the FiiO FT1 headphones. Without the need for streaming, the combination of Hi-Res file playing off a hard drive (or microSD card) straight into quality affordable headphones that massively undercut wireless over-ear cans in price. Sony and Bose have this market sewn up for the large part, and their \u00a3300+ prices are about justified with the presence of spatial audio and noise cancellation. But for pure musical enjoyment, the FT1 is a bargain. I\u2019ve heard details in songs I know well that I didn\u2019t know were there before, and the whole setup makes me want to settle into an album and really listen to it. When did you last do that? I\u2019m tired of music being the thing I listen to when I\u2019m running around Lidl. Where did my passion for it go? It excites me that a small spend on new tech could help reshape my relationship with music.\n\nI\u2019ve heard details in songs I know well that I didn\u2019t know were there before, and the whole setup makes me want to settle into an album and really listen to it."

            "article_content": "Sam Altman Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nOpenAI, as you likely know, is one of tech\u2019s biggest unicorns.\n\nA group of entrepreneurs and researchers, including Elon Musk and the company\u2019s current CEO Sam Altman, founded the artificial intelligence company in 2015. Today, OpenAI is valued at a whopping $157 billion \u2014 putting it on par with the market capitalizations of public companies like AT&T, Goldman Sachs and Uber, per The Wall Street Journal. Its flagship offering, ChatGPT, launched in 2022, and today reportedly has 250 million weekly users and 11 million paid subscribers.\n\nAmong OpenAI\u2019s investors are Microsoft, which invested $13 billion in the company, Nvidia, which invested $100 million and SoftBank, to the tune of $1.5 billion. In October, OpenAI received a $4 billion credit line \u2014 with the option to extend it another $2 billion \u2014 from JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, UBS and other institutional investors.\n\nBut OpenAI hasn\u2019t turned a profit. The company projected $5 billion in losses on $3.7 billion in revenue for 2024. It announced at the end of the year it would change its corporate structure, essentially going from a nonprofit to a company with investors and the potential for stock shares. \"We once again need to raise more capital than we\u2019d imagined,\" OpenAI\u2019s board wrote in a statement.\n\nAltman has since said the company is losing money on its $200-per-month Pro subscriptions, which offer limitless access to its most recent model, OpenAI o1, and to its video generator, Sora AI. \"People use it much more than we expected,\" he wrote in a post on X. The company\u2019s biggest cost, according to The New York Times, is powering the supercomputers that run its AI.\n\nIn a 6,000-word Q&A with Altman, Bloomberg inquired how the company prices \"technology that\u2019s never existed before.\" \"Is it market research?\" the publication asked. \"A finger in the wind?\"\n\n\"We launched ChatGPT for free, and then people started using it a lot, and we had to have some way to pay for it,\" Altman said. He said the company tested two prices for its most popular product, ChatGPT Plus: $20 and $42. Users didn\u2019t like the $42 price point, Altman said, so the company picked $20.\n\n\"It was not a rigorous \u2018hire someone and do a pricing study\u2019 thing,\" Altman said.\n\nIf history tells us much, the vast dollars-and-cents discrepancy between what investors think OpenAI is worth and the company\u2019s profits, or lack thereof, doesn\u2019t spell doom. OpenAI is far from the first tech brand to score a sky-high valuation from financial institutions despite not generating any financial returns. In 2017, roughly 76% of the companies that went public were unprofitable the year before, CNBC reported.\n\nStory Continues"

The incident, which involved an upgraded Starship carrying a test payload, prompted airlines to reroute flights over the Gulf of Mexico as debris scattered, marking a setback for Elon Musk's rocket program. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, in coordination with Turks and Caicos officials, is investigating the fallout, though no injuries have been reported.\n\nIn Belgium, scientist Clement Martin is collaborating with federal police to create a groundbreaking scent mimicking the smell of dried bones, helping sniffer dogs locate long-missing remains. This innovation follows Martin's earlier work isolating the scent of decomposing flesh, now essential in training cadaver dogs across Belgium.\n\nMeanwhile, archaeological explorations in Pompeii have uncovered an opulent private bath complex, providing insights into the affluent lifestyle of the Romans before the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The newly unearthed site features hot, warm, and cold baths that could accommodate up to 30 guests, adorned with Greek mythological themes, showcasing the luxury of that era.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "Seven-year-old electric vehicle startup Canoo has filed for bankruptcy and will \u201ccease operations immediately.\u201d The company is liquidating its assets in a Chapter 7 proceeding in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court.\n\nThe company said in a press release published late Friday that it was \u201cin discussions with foreign sources of capital\u201d that proved unsuccessful, and also singled out an inability to secure funding from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Loan Program Office, which has been on a lending spree in the waning days of the Biden administration.\n\nCanoo said in its bankruptcy filing (and the filings for its subsidiaries) that it owes money to hundreds of creditors, and that it has more than $164 million in total liabilities. It claimed around $126 million in assets.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing comes just a few weeks after Canoo furloughed the remainder of its workers and idled its factory in Oklahoma. The company struggled throughout 2024 to get more than a few of its electric vans into the hands of prospective customers, and suffered numerous executive departures. It had just $700,000 in the bank in mid-November.\n\nCanoo is the latest EV startup to go bankrupt after merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) as a shortcut to going public. Electric Last Mile Solutions was the first in June 2022. But since then, Fisker, Lordstown Motors, Proterra, Lion Electric, and Arrival all filed for different levels of bankruptcy protection in their various home countries. (Canoo bought Arrival\u2019s assets out of insolvency in 2024, though it\u2019s unclear if it ever put any of it to use.)\n\nCanoo announced plans to merge with SPAC Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. in August 2020, and went public that following December, raising around $600 million. In the years since it went public, the company made a small number of its bubbly electric vans and handed them over to partners \u2014 some paying \u2014 willing to trial the vehicles. The United States Postal Service, Department of Defense, and NASA all have or had Canoo vehicles.\n\nAt one point, the company even courted Walmart, which agreed to purchase as many as 10,000 EVs from Canoo in 2022. But the deal was essentially non-binding and bore little risk for the retail giant.\n\nCanoo was founded in late 2017 by a splinter group of executives that were fed up with the drama surrounding the other EV startup where they worked at the time, Faraday Future. Originally called Evelozcity, those executives developed a modular electric vehicle platform that could power cabins in multiple shapes and sizes, and utilized advanced technology like a steer-by-wire system.\n\nThe ideas inside Canoo were attractive enough that the startup at one point was in talks with Apple, which was interested in a potential investment or even acquisition as a way to boost the tech giant\u2019s own secretive electric car project. Former CTO and at one point CEO of Canoo, Ulrich Kranz, went on to help run Apple\u2019s car project before it was disbanded in 2024.\n\nBut Canoo underwent numerous pivots after it went public and gained a new chairman and CEO in Tony Aquila, who had invested in the company prior to the merger.\n\nA serial entrepreneur, Aquila immediately refocused Canoo away from selling to consumers and prioritized commercial fleets. On his watch, Canoo repeatedly changed plans on whether it would build its own electric vehicles or outsource the work. At one point Canoo, announced it was moving its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas \u2014 the home of Walmart \u2014 but then never really followed through. Instead, the company spent years trying to stand up multiple manufacturing facilities in Oklahoma.\n\nAquila\u2019s own financial firm appeared to benefit from his post atop the company. In 2023, Canoo spent double its meager revenue to Aquila\u2019s firm to pay for the use of its corporate jet. Canoo also rented office space from Aquila\u2019s firm, according to regulatory filings.\n\nIt was also Aquila\u2019s firm that kept Canoo alive in recent months. The firm loaned Canoo a few million dollars to keep the lights on dating back to October. Those loans were secured by a \u201cfirst priority lien and security interest\u201d on the equipment located at the Canoo\u2019s Oklahoma City facility.\n\nSigns of a bankruptcy were bubbling up all week. Reddit users noticed that the company\u2019s billboard outside its office in Justin, Texas had been taken down. Multiple employees who were on furlough told TechCrunch that they received official termination notices. Some people who had placed $100 deposits when the company was still planning on selling to regular customers had started to get refunds.\n\nThis story has been updated with new information about Canoo\u2019s total creditors, assets, and liabilities."

            "article_content": "Obesity can lead to several lifestyle diseases. Reducing weight to the optimum level can help prevent several diseases. Once someone becomes obese, it is tough to lose weight. If someone knows about the risk of becoming obese, they can take corrective measures.\n\nWoxsen University Researchers, along with US scientists, developed an AI-based prediction model to detect what they call \u2018Obesity Risk\u2019.\n\nThe team, which includes Shahid Mohammad Ganie, Hemachandran Kannan, and Bobba Bharath Reddy, along with Manjeet Rege, a professor at the University of St. Thomas, USA, have explored how combining multiple machine learning methods can predict the risk of obesity based on lifestyle data.\n\nThey introduced an AI-based prediction model that leverages boosting techniques to assess the risk of obesity more effectively.\n\nTheir research paper, \u2018An Investigation of Ensemble Learning Techniques for Obesity Risk Prediction Using Lifestyle Data,\u2019 was published in the Decision Analytics Journal by Elsevier.\n\n\u201cIdentifying the underlying causes of obesity risk in its early stages has become a challenge for medical practitioners,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cOur goal has always been to use technology to create meaningful solutions to real-world problems. By focusing on lifestyle factors and ensemble learning methods, we aim to provide healthcare professionals with actionable insights while empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their well-being,\u201d Hemachandran Kannan said.\n\nThe researchers observed that while BMI (body mass index) is commonly used as the primary indicator of obesity risk, it has limitations in capturing the full complexity of obesity, which is influenced by behavioural, environmental, and genetic factors.\n\n\u201cThey noted that BMI does not account for critical health indicators such as muscle mass, fat distribution, or other variables, potentially reducing the precision of obesity classification,\u201d they argued.\n\n\u201cOur study highlighted that while some machine learning models for obesity classification incorporate lifestyle factors, sex, and 3D body scans without relying solely on BMI, the datasets used in these models often stem from smaller sample sizes in specific regions or countries,\u201d they said.\n\nThis limited scope restricts the models\u2019 ability to generalise findings to broader or global populations.\n\nThe study also noted that the perfect climate for obesity to flourish has been created by traditional diets heavy in processed foods and low physical activity as technology develops and urbanisation picks up speed. The resultant effects include an increase in disorders linked to obesity, such as diabetes, heart problems, and other ailments.\n\nThe researchers utilised a publicly available dataset drawn from diverse populations in countries like Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. The dataset incorporated factors such as eating habits, age, sex, physical condition, water and alcohol consumption, and the frequency of vegetable intake.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

Moscow called the attack retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, which in recent weeks appear to have intensified.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said that four ballistic missiles and 39 attack drones had been launched in the assault and that two of the ballistic missiles had been shot down in the Kyiv region. Although the city comes under drone attack almost nightly, ballistic missile launches targeting the capital are less frequent.\n\nThe pre-dawn attack ruptured a water main near the city center, sending water cascading through the streets around the battered facade of the Lukianivska subway station. Nearby, smoke was rising from a charred van with at least two burned bodies inside."

            "article_content": "Britain\u2019s medics are rewriting their plans for a full-scale war as they learn lessons from the conflict in Ukraine, a leading NHS trauma surgeon has said.\n\nEvolutions in drone warfare and a return of First World War-style superbugs have presented new challenges as Western countries take steps to put their health systems on a war-footing, according to Dr Shehan Hettiaratchy.\n\nDr Hettiaratchy, the lead trauma surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare, suggested the NHS would have to be all but shut down to only deal with war casualties if Britain was to be dragged into a full-scale conflict.\n\nHe warned the health service would also be worse off compared to its European counterparts because it lacks the same headroom to expand, unlike France and Germany.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast year, General Sir Roland Walker, the head of the Army, warned Britain must be ready to fight a war against Russia in three years.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really hard to prepare\u2026 I\u2019m going to say it\u2019s not possible to prepare, because the Ukrainians weren\u2019t prepared and the Ukrainian military clearly had spent a lot of time thinking hard about if there was to be an invasion from Belarus, from Russia,\u201d Dr Hettiaratchy said on the fringes of a DGA Group event with the UK and Ukrainian governments in support of Kyiv\u2019s healthcare system.\n\n\u201cIf we get to a scenario where we are having that level of casualties and that kind of war-fighting, the health system would be only doing that. That\u2019s where we\u2019re scaled at now,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf you look at us compared to other European countries \u2013 Covid showed it \u2013 we have less capacity, less redundancy in our health system compared to other European partners.\u201d\n\nInjured soldiers are treated in a hospital bus in Donetsk. Experts say Ukraine was not ready to handle the number of casualties despite having time to prepare - Anadolu/Getty\n\nThe event held at the British ambassador\u2019s residence called for governments to do more work with private businesses to support Ukraine\u2019s war-stricken healthcare system.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDr Hettiaratchy has been working to train Ukrainian surgeons since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nHe said the challenges faced by his Ukrainian counterparts were entirely different to those faced by Western medics in Afghanistan, where he served as a combat surgeon with the British military.\n\nThe sheer number of Russian drones and Ukraine\u2019s lack of air superiority means Kyiv\u2019s combat medics don\u2019t enjoy the same luxuries experienced by Nato armies in the Middle East.\n\nWestern troops knew that in order to save as many of the injured as possible they had to get the casualties back to the field hospital at Camp Bastion within the \u201cGolden Hour\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat is great if you\u2019ve got a helicopter which can fly you back to a hospital, back to a surgeon, back to someone like me,\u201d Dr Hettiaratchy said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe problem you have in Ukraine is you don\u2019t have that scenario because of the lack of air superiority, because of drone warfare.\u201d\n\nThe number of drones and a lack of armoured personnel carriers mean Ukrainian medics are often unable to evacuate wounded troops from the frontlines for hours.\n\nThis has led to a rise in the number of amputations carried out on casualties who were strapped up with tourniquets, which are used to stop life-threatening bleeding.\n\n\u201cThese people have tourniquets on for five, 12, 24 hours, because they can\u2019t be moved back to the next line of medical support, which means they are having a high level of amputation,\u201d Dr Hettiaratchy said.\n\nHealth risks change in line with new weapons\n\nThe use of tourniquets has triggered a long-term challenge for Ukrainians who survive an initial attack. This is because when the blood circulation is cut off by the medical device, the wounded muscle starts to die and releases poison into the rest of the body.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re having a much higher rate than we would have seen before of kidney injuries, and this is how warfare changes,\u201d the surgeon added.\n\nKeir Starmer visits a hospital in Ukraine in January to shore up support for Kyiv three years after the war started - CARL COURT/AFP\n\nDr Hettiaratchy has been training Ukrainian surgeons in London as well as travelling to Western Ukraine to help improve their skills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see how they have responded and developed and grown their capabilities and their capacity to meet the challenge,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe number of casualties they\u2019ve got coming through, the types of casualties, the challenges they are facing are things we\u2019ve not seen \u2013 because we haven\u2019t had this kind of peer-on-peer fighting between two equally matched military powers going at it \u2013 since the Second World War.\u201d\n\nDespite offering his contemporaries high praise, Dr Hettiaratchy said Ukraine\u2019s healthcare system has \u201ccritical gaps\u201d which need addressing, including a lack of types of surgeons, nurses, therapists and infection control.\n\nAntibiotic-resistant superbugs\n\nHe said Western planners would have to consult First World War history books to adapt to the emergence of superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got bugs that are not cured by antibiotics. What they are describing is going back almost to the First World War, pre-antibiotic-era of surgery,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThese people now have wounds that are uncontrolled, infections are uncontrolled and uncontrollable with antibiotics, and you have to revert to First World War techniques.\u201d\n\nSpeaking before Britain unveiled \u00a3100 million in funding for Ukraine\u2019s health system, Dr Hettiaratchy urged Western governments to improve their offerings of non-lethal aid for Ukraine.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, revealed in December that almost 400,000 Ukrainian troops had been wounded since the start of the war.\n\nThe surgeon warned these would become a generational burden on the Ukrainian state if more isn\u2019t done to pick up the mantle of almost three years of brutal conflict.\n\n\u201cThere is an absolute economic society component to make sure society functions afterwards, because the volume is so high,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that Ukrainian society picks up the mantle of dealing with the consequences of their years of war, fighting, which are going to be human costs as well as other infrastructure costs\u2026 the human cost is the one that kind of almost endures and probably has the most consequence, because it\u2019s a lifetime burden.\u201d\n\nThis support must come from foreign governments and private companies, Dr Hettiaratchy said.\n\nOne of the ways businesses could help is by innovating production techniques of creating prosthetics with 3D printers to manufacture them much faster to meet demand, he added.\n\nAt least 50,000 Ukrainians have lost limbs in nearly three years of war according to the country\u2019s health ministry.\n\nDr Hettiaratchy concluded: \u201cClearly, no one has the experience that Ukraine has in terms of volume and how wide it\u2019s affected, but there are things we can do to help them understand how to tackle the problem. In many ways, they can\u2019t afford to mess this up, because the scale is so large if they get it wrong.\u201d\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

            "article_content": "What silently pulls the levers and gives liquidity to markets? Automation and complex algorithms trade securities at a blistering speed, shaping financial exchanges \u2013 and investors can use this algorithmic trading to their advantage.\n\nHere, Telegraph Money explains what algorithmic trading is and how it works in live markets.\n\nSimply, algorithmic trading is the use of computer functions to automatically make trades in financial markets.\n\nThe algorithms are pre-programmed to execute buy and sell orders based on certain variables, or a set of variables, taking place without human intervention.\n\nIn forex markets, roughly 90pc of trades are done using algorithms. In equities, roughly 60-75pc of trades in American, European and Asian capital markets are done through pre-programmed functions.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAn individual or, as is predominantly the case, an institutional investor will use automated algorithmic strategies to execute trades.\n\nInstitutional investors dominate the space through sheer position size, placing large trades to reduce transaction costs.\n\nGiven that size, one large trade from a hedge fund or investment bank has the ability to disrupt the market. Algorithmic trading can break up that trade into smaller increments to be deployed at coordinated times.\n\nFor instance, an order of 1 million shares would send a strong signal to the market, whereas an algorithm trading instruction of 1,000 shares every 15 seconds is more palatable and, in some cases, less noticeable.\n\nInitially, algorithmic trading can appear daunting. Indeed historically, trading platforms required a knowledge of coding to build the algorithms.\n\nNow, platforms cater for those with minimal coding experience and a degree in computer programming isn\u2019t necessary.\n\nTo use it, the first step is to gain an understanding of common algorithmic strategies, such as trend-following, mean reversion, high-frequency trading and arbitrage (more on these later).\n\nThen develop a strategy based on data and knowledge of the market. Consider: how will the algorithm react to certain trading signals? What has to happen for it to place orders according to those signals?\n\nBacktesting the algorithm \u2013 that is testing it using historical data \u2013 may not be necessary for a pre-existing algorithm. That said, thorough testing of how the algorithm works and its suitability for live markets is key.\n\nLike all trading strategies, implementing good risk management, like stop-losses, position sizing and diversification, is essential."

            "article_content": "We raise our fair value estimate for narrow-moat Pro Medicus PME by 2% to $46 per share, largely due to a strengthening US dollar and the time value of money. Our constant-currency earnings estimates are broadly unchanged. We expect further contract wins to underpin earnings growth. To this end, the firm announced a contract win with the University of Kentucky for a total committed minimum value of $33 million over nine years. Planning for the rollout is commencing immediately based on Pro Medicus\u2019 established cloud-based implementation and we assume a two-month earnings contribution in fiscal 2025.\n\nPro Medicus remains materially overvalued, with a lot of good news baked in. Shares currently trade over 170 times our forecast fiscal 2026 earnings per share. While some smaller radiology groups are willing to pay a premium for Visage 7, we still anticipate wider uptake to be slow. Visage 7 resonates most with US academic hospitals and large healthcare systems that have a greater interest in advanced visualizations. However, management believes that even some top hospitals don\u2019t require the best technology in the market, even in terms of speed and quality of images. We also expect downward pressure on the average size of future contracts as the more lucrative academic hospitals market inches closer to saturation.\n\nOur midcycle EBIT margin forecast stands. We forecast EBIT margin to increase slightly to 73% by fiscal 2034 from 70% in fiscal 2024. While the firm has great cost control, we think the research and development spending required to stay competitive in the long term will limit margin expansion. There are low barriers to entry in the industry, and competing products such as Philips\u2019 HealthSuite platform are catching up by utilizing or exploring similar technology such as server-side rendering, cloud-native architecture, and artificial intelligence.\n\nBusiness model is sound, but shares screen as expensive\n\nPro Medicus\u2019 strategy revolves around renewing existing contracts and winning new clients for its main product, Visage 7, while increasing its price point. The company won six out of six major public tenders it competed for in fiscal 2021, which often involved on-site pilot tests. While this likely highlights Visage 7\u2019s current superior speed, scalability, and resilience, continued investment in research and development is imperative for the firm to remain at the forefront of innovation and consistently win contracts. Most of the firm\u2019s expenses are allocated to over 40 software engineers with the main R&D center located in Berlin. The company also recently extended its R&D capability in New York in collaboration with NYU Langone Health in 2021. Its R&D efforts mostly revolve around software enhancements, program extensions, and research in artificial intelligence to assist in diagnoses.\n\nMany of Pro Medicus\u2019 competitors already utilize server-side rendering and cloud-native architecture. Legacy systems are also mostly owned by larger competitors such as GE Healthcare, Fujifilm, and Philips that will be incentivized by the high returns in the industry. In Australia, Sectra won a AUD 85 million 13-year deal over Pro Medicus with NSW Health for both its Radiology Information System and Picture Archiving Communications System in 2020.\n\nVisage 7 has found most success with US academic hospitals and in fiscal 2022 was in nine out of the top 20 ranked US hospitals, more than double its nearest competitor. While Pro Medicus has secured a few contracts with midmarket US hospitals such as Allegheny and Wellspan, wider uptake has been slow with Visage 7\u2019s features likely superfluous for their normal operations. However, Pro Medicus is still targeting smaller radiology groups that seek to consolidate IT infrastructure and become more efficient.\n\nCurrently, Visage 7 is limited to radiology departments, but Pro Medicus is aiming to extend the product set to other specialty departments including cardiology and ophthalmology. In addition, when winning contracts, the firm has other product offerings such as Open Archive or Visage RIS that it can cross-sell to clients.\n\nPME bulls say\n\nPro Medicus is well positioned to benefit from industry tailwinds such as cloud adoption, larger datasets, and remote access.\n\nEarnings are extremely defensive due to contracted revenue being largely guaranteed over five to eight years from customers.\n\nThe long-term growth opportunity is significant as most of the US market still uses legacy systems and other geographies are largely untapped.\n\nPME bears say\n\nProduct differentiation is unlikely to be durable, with low barriers to entry and larger competitors already utilizing server-side rendering and cloud-native architecture.\n\nWide adoption outside of academic hospitals is unproved, and superior speed and visualizations are likely superfluous features for the average hospital.\n\nFuture contract wins are likely to be smaller as Pro Medicus already dominates the larger US academic hospital market.\n\nTerms used in this article\n\nStar Rating: Our one- to five-star ratings are guideposts to a broad audience and individuals must consider their own specific investment goals, risk tolerance, and several other factors. A five-star rating means our analysts think the current market price likely represents an excessively pessimistic outlook and that beyond fair risk-adjusted returns are likely over a long timeframe. A one-star rating means our analysts think the market is pricing in an excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential and leaving the investor exposed to capital loss.\n\nFair Value: Morningstar\u2019s Fair Value estimate results from a detailed projection of a company's future cash flows, resulting from our analysts' independent primary research. Price To Fair Value measures the current market price against estimated Fair Value. If a company\u2019s stock trades at $100 and our analysts believe it is worth $200, the price to fair value ratio would be 0.5. A Price to Fair Value over 1 suggests the share is overvalued.\n\nMoat Rating: An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period. Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to sustain excess returns for at least a decade. For wide-moat companies, we have high confidence that excess returns will persist for 10 years and are likely to persist at least 20 years.

            "article_content": "Recent UFO Cloud Sightings Over the UK: A Growing Phenomenon\n\nIn recent years, the United Kingdom has become a hotspot for unusual atmospheric phenomena, including sightings of UFO clouds. While UFO sightings themselves are not new, there has been a notable increase in reports of strange cloud formations that appear to be connected to UFO activity. These incidents have fuelled speculation that the skies above the UK might be hiding more than just ordinary weather patterns. From rural areas in Scotland to urban centres in England, observers have documented several UFO-related cloud events, prompting fresh debates about the connection between these clouds and extraterrestrial craft.\n\nWhen people think of UFOs, they often envision saucer-shaped craft zooming through the sky, or strange lights darting across the night. However, there is another intriguing phenomenon that has become linked with UFO sightings\u2014UFO clouds. These mysterious cloud formations, which often appear anomalous or out of place, have sparked numerous theories and debates over the years. Are these clouds simply rare meteorological events, or could they be related to extraterrestrial activity? In this article, we explore the fascinating world of UFO clouds, the possible causes behind them, and how they tie into UFO lore.\n\nWhat Are UFO Clouds?\n\nThe term \"UFO cloud\" refers to a type of cloud formation that appears unusual or particularly striking in appearance, often leading observers to associate them with unidentified flying objects or extraterrestrial phenomena. These clouds are typically characterised by their strange shape, colour, or movement, and they often appear in areas where UFO sightings have been reported. While some of these clouds are nothing more than unusual atmospheric phenomena, others appear to defy typical meteorological explanations, sparking theories of alien involvement.\n\nOne of the most common characteristics of UFO clouds is their circular or disc-like shape. They often appear as smooth, flat clouds with defined edges, resembling the classic depictions of UFOs in popular culture. These formations can be strikingly similar to the saucer-shaped objects that UFO enthusiasts believe extraterrestrials use for travel. As a result, many UFO sightings involve reports of a UFO cloud in the vicinity, further fueling speculation about their connection.\n\nThe 2021 \"Saucer Cloud\" Incident Over London\n\nOne of the most widely reported UFO cloud sightings in recent UK history occurred in London in 2021. Witnesses described seeing a disc-shaped cloud hovering over the skyline, with its smooth, circular edges resembling the classic depiction of a UFO. The cloud was observed in broad daylight, and although it did not move in a manner that suggested it was a flying object, the perfectly symmetrical shape led many onlookers to wonder if it was an optical illusion caused by a UFO. Eyewitnesses also noted that the cloud appeared to glow faintly in the light, further enhancing its surreal and otherworldly presence.\n\nSeveral UFO researchers quickly jumped on the case, suggesting that the cloud could be linked to some form of atmospheric disturbance created by a UFO. Meteorologists, however, suggested that the cloud could have been a rare lenticular cloud, which can form in circular shapes under specific atmospheric conditions, especially near mountain ranges or strong wind currents. Still, the resemblance to the saucer-shaped craft often seen in UFO sightings was too uncanny to ignore, and the event gained significant attention on social media.\n\nUFO Cloud Sightings in Scotland\u2019s Highlands\n\nIn Scotland, particularly in the remote Highlands, there have been increasing reports of mysterious cloud formations that coincide with UFO sightings. In 2020, a group of hikers in the Cairngorms National Park described seeing unusual cloud structures in the sky, which they believed were connected to a UFO. The clouds were described as massive, elongated formations that appeared to \"move\" in strange patterns, with some observers even reporting that the clouds seemed to change shape rapidly, as if they were being manipulated by a force beyond the natural elements.\n\nSome locals in rural parts of Scotland have long been proponents of the idea that the area\u2019s isolation and its connection to ancient folklore might attract UFOs or otherworldly visitors. These recent cloud sightings, coupled with ongoing UFO reports, have only strengthened these theories. The belief that UFOs use the clouds as a form of camouflage or as a by-product of their energy emissions has found fertile ground in these remote communities.\n\nStrange Clouds Over Manchester\n\nIn late 2022, Manchester, a bustling urban centre in the north of England, became the site of another mysterious cloud sighting. Several witnesses reported seeing a dark, swirling cloud that appeared to hover for an unusually long period above the city. The cloud was said to take on an amorphous, disc-like form before dissipating into the sky without any clear explanation.\n\nWhat made this sighting particularly intriguing was the concurrent UFO sighting reported by a resident just hours before. According to the witness, they saw a series of bright lights darting across the sky, followed by the sudden appearance of the swirling cloud. Some speculated that the cloud might have been a side effect of the UFO\u2019s propulsion system, or that the lights and cloud were linked in some way. A few local news outlets picked up the story, with experts offering both mundane meteorological explanations and more speculative theories involving extraterrestrial phenomena.\n\nThe Connection Between UFOs and Clouds in the UK\n\nThe recent spate of UFO cloud sightings over the UK has led some to wonder whether there is a pattern connecting these unusual formations to extraterrestrial activity. The country has seen a notable uptick in UFO reports over the past decade, with several credible witnesses\u2014ranging from military personnel to ordinary citizens\u2014describing sightings of strange lights or unidentified craft in the sky.\n\nSome UFO enthusiasts and researchers argue that the unusual clouds could be camouflage for UFOs, a way for extraterrestrial craft to hide their presence in plain sight. According to this theory, UFOs might create or manipulate cloud formations in such a way as to remain undetected by conventional observation, blending in with the natural weather patterns.\n\nOthers speculate that these clouds may be linked to atmospheric anomalies created by UFO propulsion systems. Some UFOs, especially those described as \"saucer-shaped\", are often associated with electromagnetic or plasma-based propulsion methods. According to proponents of this theory, the interaction between the craft\u2019s energy field and the surrounding atmosphere could lead to the formation of oddly shaped clouds, which could be mistaken for a natural weather phenomenon.\n\nAdditionally, it's possible that the rise in sightings of UFO clouds is simply a result of heightened public awareness and media coverage of UFO phenomena. As UFOs and related sightings become a more widely discussed topic\u2014thanks in part to government disclosures and the release of previously classified reports\u2014more people may be looking at the sky with a more discerning eye, noticing unusual cloud formations that they might have otherwise overlooked.\n\nScientific and Meteorological Explanations\n\nOf course, there are scientific explanations for most of these strange cloud sightings. As mentioned earlier, lenticular clouds and roll clouds are two of the most commonly misidentified formations. Both types of clouds have a characteristic shape that can resemble UFOs or discs, particularly when seen from certain angles or under specific lighting conditions.\n\nMeteorologists also point out that some weather systems\u2014such as cold fronts or warm air surges\u2014can produce clouds that appear to behave in unusual ways, such as hanging low in the sky or shifting shape rapidly. Such phenomena could be responsible for some of the recent reports in the UK, especially those involving swirling, elongated clouds.\n\nTypes of UFO Clouds\n\nThough no official meteorological classification exists for UFO clouds, several specific types of cloud formations have become associated with UFO phenomena. These clouds share certain characteristics, which make them seem out of place or highly unusual. Here are some of the most common types:\n\n1. Lenticular Clouds\n\nLenticular clouds are large, lens-shaped clouds that often form over mountains or other elevated terrain. These clouds are typically stationary and can take on a disc-like appearance, which has led many to speculate that they are associated with UFOs. Lenticular clouds are formed when air flows over a mountain range, creating a standing wave of air. As the air moves upward and cools, it condenses into a cloud, and its shape can appear very similar to a saucer or disc.\n\nLenticular clouds are commonly mistaken for UFOs because of their smooth, distinct shape, and they often appear to hover in the sky. While these clouds are completely natural and can be explained by atmospheric science, their resemblance to UFOs has contributed to numerous sightings and theories about extraterrestrial activity.\n\n2. Roll Clouds\n\nA roll cloud is a type of low, horizontal cloud that can appear to \"roll\" across the sky, giving it a cylindrical appearance. These clouds are usually associated with storm fronts and can stretch for hundreds of miles. Although roll clouds are a well-known meteorological phenomenon, their long, uniform shape and movement can create an eerie or otherworldly effect. In some cases, roll clouds have been reported in conjunction with UFO sightings, and their unusual, rolling motion has led to speculation that they may be linked to alien technology or atmospheric anomalies caused by UFOs.\n\n3. Mammatus Clouds\n\nMammatus clouds are puffy, balloon-like formations that typically appear beneath the base of a thunderstorm cloud. They often create a striking and somewhat ominous visual effect, with their bulbous, sagging appearance giving them a surreal, otherworldly quality. While mammatus clouds are associated with intense thunderstorms, their strange shape and eerie nature have caused some to connect them with UFOs or extraterrestrial activity. The clouds' unusual appearance, particularly when seen in isolation or during an otherwise calm period, can evoke images of hovering ships or alien craft, leading to UFO-related speculation.\n\n4. Noctilucent Clouds\n\nNoctilucent clouds are high-altitude clouds that are most visible during the summer months, especially at latitudes between 50 and 70 degrees north and south. These clouds form in the mesosphere, far higher than typical clouds, and they glow with an eerie, blue or silver light after sunset. While the phenomenon can be explained by the reflection of sunlight on ice crystals in the clouds, the unusual, glowing nature of noctilucent clouds has led to various UFO-related theories. Their ethereal glow and unusual location in the atmosphere have given rise to questions about whether they might be linked to extraterrestrial activity or even serve as a cover for UFOs.\n\nUFO Clouds and the UFO Phenomenon\n\nThe connection between UFO clouds and UFO sightings is a subject of intense fascination for both UFO enthusiasts and meteorologists. Some individuals claim that certain UFO clouds are associated with UFO activity, suggesting that the clouds might be a type of camouflage or atmospheric distortion created by alien spacecraft. Others believe that UFOs themselves may be responsible for the formation of these clouds, either as a result of the energy they emit or the atmospheric disturbances they cause.\n\nOne of the most notable cases linking UFOs to clouds occurred in 1957, when several people reported seeing a UFO hovering above a strange cloud formation over the Pacific Northwest in the United States. The object was described as disc-shaped, and the cloud that formed underneath it appeared to be perfectly round, prompting some to believe that the cloud was the result of the UFO\u2019s activity. Since then, similar reports of UFO sightings coinciding with unusual cloud formations have been documented, further cementing the idea that there may be a connection.\n\nScientific Explanations vs. Extraterrestrial Theories\n\nWhile UFO clouds are often seen as evidence of alien involvement in atmospheric phenomena, there are more grounded scientific explanations for these unusual cloud formations. Meteorologists argue that many of the clouds associated with UFO sightings are simply natural occurrences. Lenticular clouds, roll clouds, and mammatus clouds are all well-documented and have clear meteorological explanations that do not require the involvement of extraterrestrial beings.\n\nHowever, the mystique of UFOs and the possibility of alien life continues to captivate the human imagination. For many, the idea that UFOs might be responsible for certain cloud formations provides a compelling narrative that fits within the broader framework of UFO lore. The persistent sightings of these clouds, combined with the belief in extraterrestrial visitation, means that UFO clouds will likely continue to fuel theories and debates for years to come.\n\nConclusion: A Continued Mystery\n\nThe recent sightings of UFO clouds in the UK serve to deepen the mystery surrounding both unidentified flying objects and the enigmatic nature of cloud formations. While scientific explanations are readily available, the persistent association of these unusual clouds with UFO sightings continues to fuel the debate about extraterrestrial involvement.\n\nAs UFO sightings remain a popular subject of fascination for many, it seems likely that these strange, disc-shaped clouds and anomalous weather phenomena will continue to spark curiosity. Whether they are merely natural atmospheric events or signs of something more profound remains a question that has yet to be definitively answered. For now, the skies above the UK\u2014and the mysterious clouds within them\u2014remain a captivating enigma."

            "article_content": "Chief Adviser's Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam on Saturday, January 18, said ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina must be returned to the country through legal process and brought her to justice.\n\n\"The way Sheikh Hasina brought back her father's murderers, we will bring back the murderers of the movement and try them in court,\" he said.\n\nShafiqul made the remarks while speaking as the main discussant at a seminar titled 'July Revolution Aspirations and the Media' in Kushtia.\n\nThe Islamic University, IU, authorities and the Islamic University Journalists Association, IUJA, jointly organised the seminar at Bir Shrestha Hamidur Rahman Auditorium on the campus in the district.\n\nAlam said the interim government is working on state reforms to build Bangladesh as per the aspirations of the July Revolution and implementing the aspirations of the people.\n\nHe also said half of the IU students are female ones, which is a very good image.\n\n\"I saw in the documentary that girls were leading the July movement. This university played an important role in the movement,\" the press secretary said.\n\nNoting that this image should be conveyed to the world as the future of the students is related to the image, he said, \"We have to work to preserve the history of the movement of this university.\"\n\nHe said the names of the halls that still remain in the name of the dictator need to be changed to the martyrs' names.\n\nThe press secretary said the aspirations of people are being fulfilled through reform commissions to build a new Bangladesh.\n\nThe reports of commissions are the outcomes of the July Uprising, he said, urging all students to read these reports and join debate on those on the campus.\n\nChaired by Chairman of IU Communication and Multimedia Journalism Department Professor Dr Rashiduzzaman, the seminar was addressed, among others, by IU Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Nakib Muhammad Nasrullah, Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Yeaqub Ali, treasurer Professor Dr Jahangir Alam and treasurer of Jashore University of Science and Technology Professor Dr Hossain Al Mamun.\n\nSM Rashidul Islam, special correspondent of Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), also spoke at the seminar as a discussant.\n\nSource: BSS"
