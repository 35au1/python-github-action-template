Called Perplexity Assistant, the AI helper is available through the Perplexity app on the Google Play Store and is supported in 15 languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Hindi.\n\nWhile we haven\u2019t had a chance to try out the new Perplexity Assistant, the company claims it can perform multi-app actions, similar to Gemini\u2019s recently acquired chaining actions that Google first demonstrated on the Galaxy S25 series.\n\nHere are a few more examples of what Perplexity Assistant can do. We can\u2019t wait to see how you use it. pic.twitter.com/F7ibSFfrgq Get it here: https://t.co/H4J9cr68So \u2014 Perplexity (@perplexity_ai) January 23, 2025\n\nFor example, you can ask the AI to \u201cplay that song at the end of Interstellar.\u201d It will research the song\u2019s name on the web and open a music app on your phone to play it.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure how this would function, but we\u2019re guessing you\u2019ll have to grant Perplexity some permissions to open and execute commands on your apps. Gemini uses extensions to facilitate chaining actions, but Perplexity hasn\u2019t really elaborated on how its AI will facilitate multi-app actions on Android phones.\n\nPerplexity Assistant is also multimodal, which means it can answer questions based on voice commands and understand multiple types of data, such as text, images, audio, and video. \u201cYou can tell it to turn on the camera and ask about what you see in front of you or on your screen,\u201d the company explains.\n\nThe company lists Perplexity Assistant\u2019s other capabilities as follows: \u201cYou can book dinner, find a forgotten song, call a ride, draft emails, set reminders, and more.\u201d\n\nLooks like we\u2019ll have to give Perplexity Assistant a go and see how it compares to Gemini.\n\nYou might like"

Representative Image. Credit: Reuters\n\nIn a virtual speech at the World Economic Forum on Thursday, President Donald Trump revealed that his administration is looking to speed up the approval process for AI companies seeking to build power plants for their data centres. This move aims to address the increasing energy needs of AI systems and ensure the US stays competitive with China in the tech race.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan involves using a national energy emergency declaration to push through the construction of fossil-fuel-powered plants directly serving AI data centres. This would cut down on the long wait times typically associated with building new power plants, allowing AI companies to quickly ramp up their operations. He pointed out that the US would need to double its current energy capacity to fully realise AI\u2019s potential, making it a vital part of staying ahead in the global tech competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA new way of powering data centres\n\nThe idea behind Trump\u2019s plan is to set up new power plants right next to data centres, creating self-sufficient facilities rather than relying on the national grid. This model is already being explored by energy giants like Chevron and Exxon, who are looking at ways to support the growing demand for power in the tech industry.\n\nWith data centres already consuming as much energy as small cities, the rise of AI is only going to increase this demand. Trump\u2019s announcement highlights the urgency of securing enough power to fuel the AI boom, especially as competition with China intensifies.\n\nThe rising energy demands of AI\n\nAI is having a massive impact across various sectors, not just in tech but also in energy, real estate, and construction. The need for more computing power and infrastructure is driving up demand for energy, with AI\u2019s rapid growth requiring huge amounts of electricity to operate.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal to fast-track power plant construction is an attempt to ensure that AI companies have the resources they need to scale up quickly. As AI becomes an even bigger part of the economy, having a reliable energy supply will be crucial for the US to maintain its position as a leader in the global AI race."

Children younger than age 13 will not be permitted into the show.\n\n\"Our show is rated R, so we don't allow children under the age of 13,\" Copeland said. \"The show contains horror, violence and imagery, bad language and adult humor ... It's a horror circus. All of our acts are performed by horror creatures and characters, zombies, vampires, ghosts, what have you. It's great because you don't have to wait until Halloween to have fun with some smoky, scary, sexy entertainment.\"\n\nParanormal Cirque II is a branch of Cirque Italia, which has five shows crisscrossing the United States. Last year, two of its shows went to Canada for the first time, and two new shows will be touring Canada this summer.\n\n\"We're very excited to be bringing our (Cirque Italia) show tally up to seven touring productions,\" Copeland said. \"There are three units of Paranormal Cirque. We are Paranormal Cirque II, and we're the best.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParanormal Cirque I, began in 2018, followed by Paranormal Cirque II in 2022, and Paranormal Cirque III beginning in 2023.\n\n\"In fact, Albuquerque was our first stop with Paranormal Cirque II,\" Copeland said. \"(Albuquerque) got to see the world premiere of our show ... Paranormal Cirque is a very popular show, which is why we have three units and soon to be a fourth Canadian unit as well.\"\n\nParanormal Cirque II is made up of a crew and company of about 50 people.\n\n\"Everybody does everything,\" Copeland said. \"The people that sell you your popcorn and concessions are the ones that help put up the tent. The people that are taking you to your seat for the show are also running the sounds and lights. In addition to being a comedian in the show, I'm also the social media director and publicity director for the unit. We all wear multiple hats here and we all do different jobs to get the show down the road.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe production features an international cast of performers. Copeland is one of two American performers.\n\n\"We have lots of performers from Latin American countries, and everybody has come from different backgrounds, some circus, some theater, some dance,\" he said. \"We have a truly eclectic variety of performers with our show.\"\n\nCopeland encourages eventgoers to arrive an hour prior to the show to be part of the \"haunt attraction preshow.\"\n\n\"During that time, you can meet our performers up close and personal,\" he said. \"They're going to scare your pants off before they wow you on stage.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnacks such as popcorn, cotton candy, nachos, hot dogs and nonalcoholic beverages will be available for purchase. Souvenirs, masks, hats and 1950s pin-up girls drawn in a paranormal style by artist Ryan Combs, will also be sold.\n\nEventgoers can also take part in a QR code hunt.\n\n\"You can go around and find seven QR codes, scan them with your phone and find out fun information about our show, about our company and some of our performers,\" Copeland said. \"That all begins one hour before showtime. It's included with your ticket. And in addition to that, I just want to remind people to get their tickets early, either paranormalcirque.com or at the ticket office once we're in town. I just wouldn't recommend waiting until the last minute, because some of our shows are already close to selling out, and we don't want anyone to miss the fun.\""

            "article_content": "Some of the best horror movies in history are independent films produced outside of the Hollywood major-studio system. Horror hounds appreciate that these smaller indie films showcase a level of creative freedom not often found in a big-budget studio flick.\n\nImagine the horror genre today if there were no Halloween, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Night of the Living Dead, The Evil Dead, or The Blair Witch Project. These seminal fright films all scared up box office dollars outside the studio system and each spawned franchises, spin-offs, remakes, and countless imitators.\n\nHalloween (1978)\n\nImage Credit: Compass International Pictures.\n\nJohn Carpenter's seasonal slasher Halloween is about an escaped mental patient named Michael Myers who returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, to stalk and terrorize babysitters on Halloween. The movie introduced audiences to scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays \u201cfinal girl\u201d Laurie Strode.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProduced by Compass International Pictures, Halloween cost about $325,000 to produce and made $70 million worldwide. Today, there are a lot of films in the Halloween franchise, the most recent entry being 2022's Halloween Ends, featuring the final face-off between Michael and Laurie.\n\nHalloween has influenced everything from Friday the 13th to Scream to pretty much every horror movie you've ever watched featuring a masked boogeyman.\n\nThe Blair Witch Project (1999)\n\nImage Credit: Artisan Entertainment.\n\nDaniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez's The Blair Witch Project didn't invent the found-footage genre, but it might as well have. The supernatural horror film is about three student filmmakers who disappeared in the woods while filming a documentary about the Blair Witch in the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland.\n\nThe brilliant marketing campaign for Haxan Films' The Blair Witch Project led many to believe that the footage was authentic and that the three student filmmakers were actually missing people. Shot for under $1 million and distributed by Artisan Entertainment, The Blair Witch Project made over $248 million and spawned two sequels as well as countless imitators.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the movie doesn't hold up after repeated viewings because the element of surprise is essential to its effectiveness, you'll never forget the first time you saw The Blair Witch Project and the chills felt all over your body during that final scene with one character facing the wall in the dark cellar of an abandoned house.\n\nIt Follows (2014)\n\nImage Credit: RADiUS-TWC.\n\nDavid Robert Mitchell's terrifying It Follows tells the story of a young woman named Jaime \u201cJay\u201d Height (Maika Monroe) who, after a romantic rendezvous, is pursued by a shape-shifting, relentless entity that only she can see. The only way to break the \u201ccurse\u201d is to have amorous relations with someone else and pass it to them, kind of like transmitting an STD.\n\nMitchell builds a tense atmosphere that turns into panic as Jay tries to evade the sinister entity that takes the form of different people. What could have been just another low-budget, independent movie about a boogeyman chasing a young woman, It Follows instead brings up questions about guilt surrounding intimate encounters and our fear of contracting diseases from partners.\n\nA sequel titled They Follow is in the works, with Monroe set to return.\n\nNight of the Living Dead (1968)\n\nImage Credit: Continental Distributing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorge A. Romero directed, co-wrote, and edited the independent horror classic Night of the Living Dead and kick-started the modern era of zombie movies. The black-and-white film follows seven people trapped in a farmhouse in rural Pennsylvania as the zombie apocalypse begins outside. Night of the Living Dead is also noteworthy for casting a Black man (Duane Jones) as the lead character in a 1960s horror movie.\n\nRomero made Night of the Living Dead on a budget of only $114,000, and the movie earned about $30 million worldwide at the box office. The groundbreaking indie spawned five official sequels as well as countless spin-offs, rip-offs, homages, and remakes. Popular TV series such as The Walking Dead would not exist without Night of the Living Dead.\n\nHereditary (2018)\n\nImage Credit: A24.\n\nToni Collette plays Annie Graham \u2014 a miniatures artist whose family gets terrorized by supernatural forces after the death of Annie's secretive mother \u2014 in Ari Aster's Hereditary. We learn that Annie's mother was a member of a sinister coven determined to find a human vessel for the demon king Paimon, which is why Annie's house and family are seemingly possessed.\n\nA24's Hereditary is one of the scariest movies of the past 10 years because it takes itself seriously and doesn't rely on cheap scares, bursts of humor, or witty pop-culture references. Those things can be fun in another movie, but Hereditary is an indie horror film that gets underneath the skin by making us question if we really know the people closest to us.\n\nParanormal Activity (2007)\n\nImage Credit: Paramount Pictures.\n\nBlumhouse Productions' Paranormal Activity is a found-footage horror film about a married couple (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat) dealing with an increasingly threatening supernatural presence in their home.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParanormal Activity was so successful \u2014 it cost $215,000 to produce and made $194 million worldwide \u2014 that it launched a franchise consisting of seven films (so far). Although the indie production spawned too many subpar rip-offs that led to audience found-footage fatigue, Paranormal Activity proved that you don't need a big studio budget to scare the bejesus out of people.\n\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)\n\nImage Credit: Bryanston Distributing Company.\n\nTobe Hooper's terrifying indie The Texas Chain Saw Massacre introduced the world to Leatherface and his family of cannibals who prey on tourists in rural Texas. Loosely based on the killings by Ed Gein, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre became a cult classic and launched a franchise that consists of nine movies to date.\n\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre had a production budget of only $140,000 and made about $30 million worldwide. The movie's indie budget actually works in its favor and gives the horror classic a gritty, realistic feel that makes the experience exponentially more terrifying. The incessant sound of a chainsaw buzzing, the bloodcurdling screaming by leading lady Marilyn Burns, and the crazy camera zooms on her terrified eyes trick your mind into thinking that you see more blood and violence on-screen than what is actually shown.\n\nThe Evil Dead (1981)\n\nImage Credit: New Line Cinema.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSam Raimi's feature directorial debut stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, who vacations with his girlfriend, sister, and friends at a remote cabin in the woods. There the group finds an audiotape containing an incantation that unleashes demons and spirits that try to possess the cabin and its occupants.\n\nThe Evil Dead not only became a horror classic that spawned several sequels, a TV series, and a remake, but it also made Raimi a sought-after director and Campbell a horror icon. Although subsequent movies in The Evil Dead franchise lean into comedy more, this grainy, low-budget ($375,000), 16mm indie depicts a haunted cabin that still makes one's skin crawl.\n\nPumpkinhead (1988)\n\nImage Credit: United Artists.\n\nDe Laurentiis Entertainment Group's Pumpkinhead is the directorial debut of special effects master Stan Winston. The movie follows a rural, small-store owner named Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen) who seeks out a local swamp witch to summon a demon named Pumpkinhead and exact revenge on a group of reckless young adults who accidentally killed his young son.\n\nPumpkinhead is an excellent argument for the use of practical effects instead of CGI. Winston's terrifying titular creature looks alive and has realistic movements, which makes the cult movie that much scarier.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAlthough Pumpkinhead didn't scare up a lot of money during its theatrical release, the movie developed a cult following thanks to multiple home video releases. This led to three sequels and a planned reboot in the works.\n\nMadman (1981)\n\nImage Credit: Jensen Farley Pictures.\n\nJoe Giannone's slasher film Madman is the type of indie horror gem curated by MoviVue. Based on the New York legend of Cropsey, Madman is about a campfire story that inadvertently summons the axe-wielding Madman Marz at a camp. Dawn of the Dead actress Gaylen Ross plays \u201cfinal girl\u201d Betsy.\n\nDistributed by Jensen Farley Pictures, Madman became a sleeper hit thanks to drive-in theaters and has since developed a cult following. Fans of 1980s slasher films will want to check this one out.\n\nDonnie Darko (2001)\n\nImage Credit: Newmarket Films.\n\nSet in 1988, Donnie Darko stars Jake Gyllenhaal as the titular teen who narrowly escapes a plane engine crashing into his house thanks to his tendency to sleepwalk. Donnie keeps having disturbing visions of a giant rabbit named Frank, who warns Donnie about the exact time the world will end.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTalk of time travel and mental illness adds another layer of intrigue to this arthouse horror movie turned cult classic produced by Flower Films \u2014 a production company owned by Drew Barrymore, who appears in Donnie Darko as one of Donnie's teachers. Viewers feel as disoriented and confused as Donnie as he tries to figure out what is going on before time runs out.\n\nPearl (2022)\n\nImage Credit: Christopher Moss \u2013 Origin Picture Show LLC/A24.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTi West's Pearl is a prequel to X, both starring Mia Goth. In Pearl, which is set in 1918 and filmed like the Gone With the Wind of horror, Goth plays the titular Texas farm girl whose desire for fame results in her lashing out violently against those closest to her.\n\nGoth cemented her scream queen status by playing the '70s adult film actress Maxine Minx in Ti West's X. In Pearl, Goth delivers an Oscar-worthy performance and unforgettable cuckoo-bananas monologue that transcends horror-genre expectations. In MaXXXine, the third film in the trilogy, Goth reprises her role as Maxine Minx in 1985 Los Angeles, where Maxine tries to become a Hollywood scream queen as the Night Stalker terrorizes the city.\n\nEraserhead (1977)\n\nImage Credit: Libra Films.\n\nEraserhead, the feature-length directorial debut of auteur David Lynch, is a surreal, black-and-white, body-horror movie about a man named Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) forced to care for his deformed baby in a desolate industrial hellscape.\n\nAlthough Eraserhead wasn't a blockbuster during its initial release, the successful indie film became a favorite midnight movie and subsequently achieved cult status. If you can watch Henry's infant \u2014 which looks like a grotesque, oversized baby bird wrapped in bandages and makes unsettling gurgling sounds \u2014 and not feel your flesh crawl, check to make sure you still have a pulse."

Still, an estimated 1.3 million new HIV infections were reported around the world in 2023, with 630,000 related deaths, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nRelated Articles Science | Biden health officials say they built up US pandemic defenses.

But there is no cure for HIV or AIDS or a vaccine for human use to prevent infection.\n\nOne of the labs involved in current research to design such a vaccine is at La Jolla-based Scripps Research, which recently made a discovery that could drive development of the vaccine.\n\nMany vaccines work by introducing a protein to the body that resembles part of a virus. Ideally, the immune system will produce long-lasting antibodies recognizing that virus, thereby providing protection.\n\nBut Scripps Research scientists said they have found that for some HIV vaccines, something else happens. After a few applications, the immune system begins to produce antibodies against immune complexes already bound to the viral protein.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique reaction in which antibodies bind to other antibodies, which is rare,\u201d said Scripps researcher Sharidan Brown, first author of a study published Jan. 17 in Science Immunology. \u201cOver the course of multiple immunizations [in animals], we have found four classes of antibodies that cling to other antibodies. They are unique responses, so by understanding the structure for the first time, we are put on the right foot to understand these better and can harness them for not only HIV vaccine design but other therapeutics.\u201d\n\nThe observation came about when researchers in the lab of Andrew Ward, a professor of integrative structural and computational biology at Scripps Research, was using advanced imaging tools to study how antibodies evolve after multiple HIV vaccine doses. A technique the lab invented, known as Electron Microscopy-Based Polyclonal Epitope Mapping, or EMPEM, let the researchers see exactly where on the virus antibodies bind.\n\nWhen they carried out the experiments on blood from animals that had received multiple doses of an experimental HIV vaccine, they discovered that some of the antibodies were not binding directly to the HIV viral antigen but to immune molecules on its surface.\n\nIt isn\u2019t yet known whether this binding is a good thing in designing an effective vaccine, but Brown said future studies should answer that question.\n\n\u201cIt adds to our understanding of what these vaccines are capable of eliciting,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe don\u2019t fully know what these antibodies do yet, but by understanding and future experiments looking into why they get elicited and what they do, we can adjust vaccine studies to make them more effective by either harnessing or getting rid of it.\n\n\u201cIt could be a good thing [that the antibodies bind together] because it could give the immune system a bigger set of antibodies. Or it could be detrimental in that it is not making antibodies the body needs.\u201d\n\nShe and others in the lab \u201care excited to see where these antibodies fit into the immune response and the body\u2019s ability to fight off HIV,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could lead to redesigning vaccines to target or eliminate these responses and could lead to better vaccines.\u201d\n\nImplementation of any vaccine stemming from this discovery is years away from human trials, but Brown said an effective vaccine would have a great impact.\n\n\u201cThere are still millions of people diagnosed with HIV, so having a vaccine would impact the lives of people around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a vaccine that prevents infection would be instrumental in reducing the spread. Right now, there are no vaccines in use in humans. There are clinical trials in humans, which is exciting, and we have made a lot of progress toward eliciting the types of antibodies with these vaccines in the past five years or so. This [discovery] is an extra data point to think about when we design these vaccines and could help us better design boosting immunizations.\u201d\n\nBrown, a native of Montana, \u201cwhere I fell in love with science,\u201d said she came to Scripps Research for her Ph.D. studies and was placed in her current lab to research immunology and structural biology.\n\n\u201cI feel super lucky to work in the lab I do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have such a diverse, large lab of people full of amazing ideas.\u201d\n\nThe next step for the lab is to look at the antibody responses in other models.\n\n\u201cWe want to understand how they are generated and what they do, and any consequences to these antibodies being around,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThen we can modify these types of responses in vaccine design.\u201d \u2666"

            "article_content": "Save\n\nQ&A: Oncofertility innovator awarded National Medal of Science\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nTeresa K. Woodruff, PhD, was one of 14 recipients of the National Medal of Science in 2025.\n\nShe is credited with creating the field of oncofertility, which focuses on preserving fertility during cancer treatment.\n\nFew researchers can claim to be a pioneer in their field quite like Teresa K. Woodruff, PhD.\n\nWhile serving as the basic science director at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, Woodruff recognized there was little attention being paid to the reproductive future of girls and young women who had cancer.\n\n\u201cIn that role, I learned of a boy with cancer who was being brought down from our pediatric hospital to bank sperm because his mother asked for it,\u201d Woodruff, who currently serves as president emerita of Michigan State University and an MSU Research Foundation Professor in obstetrics, gynecology, reproductive biology and biomedical engineering, told Healio. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard of it, nobody had heard of it, because it just wasn\u2019t done.\n\n\u201cI asked, \u2018What do we do for young women,\u2019\u201d Woodruff said. \u201cI was told they need to focus on their cancer and get better from that disease. It was that thunderbolt moment that I thought my research can have something to do with the options that these cancer patients might have.\u201d\n\nWoodruff came up with the word oncofertility to describe a new medical field dedicated toward preserving fertility for a young person undergoing cancer treatment. Shortly after inventing the term, Woodruff founded the Oncofertility Consortium, which consists of a group of health care professionals and researchers who are focused on exploring and solving the many issues surrounding fertility during cancer treatment.\n\nWoodruff\u2019s work in oncofertility is just one reason she received an illustrious honor in January. Former President Joe Biden named Woodruff as one of 14 recipients of the National Medal of Science, an honor granted to those who make outstanding contributions to science in service of the U.S.\n\nHealio spoke with Woodruff about her career accomplishments, her tenure as president of the Endocrine Society in 2013-2014 and what the National Medal of Science means to her.\n\nHealio: What inspired you to pursue a career in the sciences, medicine and reproductive health?\n\nWoodruff: I was inspired in the sciences by my mother when I was in third grade. She was teaching a summer class in our area on volcano science. It inspired me to want to be a first grade teacher.\n\nI went to college to major in elementary education. There I found the sciences and my love of research. One of my professors asked me if I\u2019d be interested in doing research. He took me to California Institute of Technology in 1984. I really got the bug for science then, and later for reproductive science.\n\nI decided I was going to pursue a PhD when I was doing rotations in laboratories at Northwestern University. There was a professor named Kelly Mayo, PhD, and he was researching molecular endocrinology, the genes that control reproductive cycles. I joined his lab and really haven\u2019t turned back since.\n\nHealio: Why did you decide to create the Oncofertility Consortium?\n\nWoodruff: To get from bench to bedside and to have a profound effect on patients, you have to go around the entire circumference of the problem. A patient isn\u2019t going to be able to access the protocols if an oncologist isn\u2019t talking to an in vitro fertilization doctor, that patient is not going to be able to opt in if there\u2019s no insurance coverage, a doctor\u2019s not going to offer it if there\u2019s no reimbursement and if a parent or a partner can\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening, they\u2019re going to say, \u201cLet\u2019s just focus on cancer.\u201d\n\nWhat the consortium said is that we must have a continuum of care from the bench to bedside to babies. We\u2019ve got to bring in the students, the nurses, patients and we have to bring in oncology. We\u2019ve got to bring in social science, ethics and religion. And we have to work toward insurance and reimbursement availability.\n\nThe consortium was meant to be the hub to bring everybody together around this new idea and new word of oncofertility. It was really a consequence of saying, \u201cWe\u2019re all in this at the beginning.\u201d That is why it worked, because it wasn\u2019t a few people building it. We were all building it.\n\nHealio: Is there any achievement in your career that you are most proud of and why?\n\nWoodruff: The first live birth of mice from the oocyte outside the body was named the Discovery of the Decade [by Nature Medicine]. That discovery was done with Lonnie Shea, PhD, who is at University of Michigan. He was my great collaborator on many of our discoveries.\n\nThat discovery is only closely first to the [discovery of] zinc spark. Zinc spark is this magnificent release of zinc from the oocyte at the time of fertilization. Nobody even knew to look for zinc. We discovered this massive upregulation of zinc, and then the release of it at fertilization. That was done with my collaborator, Tom O\u2019Halloran, PhD. Those were two monumental discoveries in the field of reproductive science.\n\nHealio: What do you like most about being a member of the Endocrine Society? What was your experience like when you served as president at the Endocrine Society?\n\nWoodruff: I gave my first scientific talk at the Endocrine Society meeting in New Orleans in 1988. It\u2019s a place where I have grown up as a scientist and as a scholar. I\u2019ve presented my work and eventually went through a lot of the leadership roles there.\n\nThe organization is one that focuses on the pipeline of development of people. The society develops people to enable them to do their best work in the clinic or at the bench. Many societies say they are just a clinical society or a basic science society. The Endocrine Society is all of us. I think that\u2019s what really makes it a powerful voice for endocrinology in the nation.\n\n[When I was president], there were so many milestones. We bought a building in downtown Washington, D.C. Our CEO, Scott Hunt, decided to retire, so we had to do a CEO search for the first time in 25 years. We were also in the middle of a rebranding of the organization. Those were three of the real highlights that I think have resonated and continued to be impactful over time.\n\nHealio: When did you decide to apply for a position at Michigan State and what attracted you to the university?\n\nWoodruff: Michigan State is a great land grant institution that has this real breadth going from the land, water and animal science all the way to human medicine and to the stars. One of the key discoveries at Michigan State was of cisplatin, the cancer drug that has saved so many lives. Michigan State had always been on my radar for that discovery, because oncofertility was providing the fertility to those people whose lives had been saved by that drug.\n\nHealio: What did receiving the National Medal of Science mean to you?\n\nWoodruff: I was so humbled. It was such a humbling call when I first learned of it. This is an award for the folks in the lab, my collaborators like Lonnie and Tom, for my students, and for the field. I\u2019m so pleased that I had the opportunity to be a small part of what\u2019s become a true field of medicine that is making a difference in patients\u2019 lives all around the globe.\n\nReferences:\n\nClark D.

            "article_content": "By Aditya Kalra, Arpan Chaturvedi and Munsif Vengattil\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian book publishers and their international counterparts have filed a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI in New Delhi, a representative said on Friday, the latest in a series of global cases seeking to stop the ChatGPT chatbot accessing proprietary content.\n\nCourts across the world are hearing claims by authors, news outlets and musicians who accuse technology firms of using their copyright work to train AI services and who are seeking to have content used to train the chatbot deleted.\n\nThe New Delhi-based Federation of Indian Publishers told Reuters it had filed a case at the Delhi High Court, which is already hearing a similar lawsuit against OpenAI.\n\nThe case was filed on behalf of all the federation's members, who include publishers like Bloomsbury, Penguin Random House, Cambridge University Press and Pan Macmillan, as well as India's Rupa Publications and S.Chand and Co, it said.\n\n\"Our ask from the court is that they should stop (OpenAI from) accessing our copyright content,\" Pranav Gupta, the federation's general secretary said in an interview about the lawsuit, which concerns the ChatGPT tool's book summaries.\n\n\"In case they don't want to do licensing with us, they should delete datasets used in AI training and explain how we will be compensated. This impacts creativity,\" he added.\n\nOpenAI did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations and the lawsuit, which was filed in December but is being reported here for the first time. It has repeatedly denied such allegations, saying its AI systems make fair use of publicly available data.\n\nOpenAI kicked off an investment, consumer and corporate frenzy in generative AI after the Nov. 2022 launch of ChatGPT. It wants to be ahead in the AI race after raising $6.6 billion last year.\n\nThe Indian book publishers' group is seeking to join Indian news agency ANI's lawsuit against the Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which is the most high-profile legal proceeding in the nation on this subject.\n\n\"These cases represent a pivotal moment and can potentially shape the future legal framework on AI in India. The judgment passed here will test the balance between protecting IP and promoting tech advancement,\" said Siddharth Chandrashekhar, a Mumbai based lawyer.\n\nResponding to the ANI case, OpenAI said in comments reported by Reuters this week that any order to delete training data would result in a violation of its U.S. legal obligations, and Indian judges have no right to hear a copyright case against the company as its servers are located abroad.\n\nThe federation said OpenAI offers services in India so its activities should fall under Indian laws.\n\nReuters, which holds a 26% interest in ANI, has said in a statement it is not involved in its business practices or operations.\n\nOpenAI made its first India hire last year when it tapped former WhatsApp executive, Pragya Misra, to handle public policy and partnerships in the country of 1.4 billion people, where millions of new users are going online, thanks to cheap mobile data prices.\n\nWORRIES OVER BOOK SUMMARIES\n\nA Reuters reporter asked ChatGPT on Friday for details of the first volume of the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling, published by Bloomsbury. The AI tool responded with a chapter-by-chapter summary and a key events summary including the story's climax.\n\nIt stopped short of giving the actual text, however, saying, \"I cannot provide the entire text of the book, as it is copyrighted material.\"\n\nPenguin Random House in November said it has started a global initiative to include a statement on the copyright page of its titles saying \"no part of this book may be used or reproduced in any manner for the purpose of training\" AI technologies.\n\nThe Indian federation's December filing, which was seen by Reuters, argues it has obtained \"credible evidence/information\" from its members that OpenAI used their literary works to train its ChatGPT service.\n\n\"This free tool produces book summaries, extracts, why would people buy books then?\" Gupta said, referring to AI chatbots using extracts from unlicensed online copies. \"This will impact our sales, all members are concerned about this.\"\n\nThe federation's plea has so far only been listed before a court registrar in New Delhi who on Jan 10 asked OpenAI to respond in the matter. A judge will now hear the case on Jan. 28.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra, Arpan Chaturvedi and Munsif Vengattil; editing by Philippa Fletcher)\n\nCopyright 2025 Thomson Reuters."

Operator is a web app that can carry out simple online tasks in a browser, such as booking concert tickets or filling an online grocery order. The app is powered by a new model called Computer-Using Agent\u2014CUA for short\u2014built on top of OpenAI\u2019s multimodal large language model GPT-4o.\n\n\n\nWhy it matters: OpenAI claims that Operator outperforms similar rival tools, including Anthropic\u2019s Computer Use and Google DeepMind\u2019s Mariner. The fact that three of the world\u2019s top AI firms have converged on the same vision of what agent-based models could be makes one thing clear.

Some are upbeat and vocally hopeful that a future is just around the corner in which machines can expertly handle much of what is currently done by humans, from cooking to surgery. Others are scared: of job losses, injuries, and whatever problems may come up as we try to live side by side.\n\n\n\nThe final camp, which I think is the largest, is just unimpressed. We\u2019ve been sold lots of promises that robots will transform society ever since the first robotic arm was installed on an assembly line at a General Motors plant in New Jersey in 1961. Few of those promises have panned out so far.\n\nBut this year, there\u2019s reason to think that even those staunchly in the \u201cbored\u201d camp will be intrigued by what\u2019s happening in the robot races.

            "article_content": "ZDNET\n\nImagine an AI bot that can fill out online forms, book airline flights, order groceries, and more. That's the intent of OpenAI's new Operator, an AI that acts as an independent agent to carry out your commands all on its own.\n\nAlso: Operator isn't worth its $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro subscription yet - here's why\n\nReleased as a research preview on Thursday, Operator is able to interact directly with a web browser. That means it can navigate web pages by typing, scrolling, and clicking in all the right spots, just as you would yourself. The difference here is that Operator aims to do all that without any intervention on your part.\n\nSounds cool, but Operator is starting off slowly.\n\nHow to try ChatGPT Pro\n\nBeyond its initial research preview status, the tool is now accessible only with ChatGPT Pro subscriptions in the US, which cost $200 a month. As the AI evolves and learns from its mistakes, OpenAI plans to expand its reach to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and eventually integrate its skills directly into ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT Pro users who want to take Operator for a spin should browse to its dedicated web page. Make sure you're signed in with your OpenAI account. From there, type a request at the prompt just as you normally would with ChatGPT. Only you'll want to fashion that request as one that asks Operator to carry out tasks on the web independently.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT vs. ChatGPT Plus: Is a paid subscription still worth it?\n\nFor example, you could ask Operator to find and book a tour of Rome through Tripadvisor, order more bananas and apples from Instacart, or purchase Apple's AirPods Pro 2 from Amazon. You can even tell the bot to handle several tasks simultaneously. To help Operator carry out actions with specific vendors and websites, OpenAI is working with companies such as DoorDash, Instacart, OpenTable, Priceline, StubHub, Thumbtack, and Uber.\n\nWhat to expect with Operator\n\nAs cool as all this may sound, there are certainly potential pitfalls and problems. Depending on the complexity of the task, Operator could get stuck or make a mistake along the way. In that case, it will try to self-correct. If that doesn't work, the tool will hand control back to you to intervene.\n\nOperator is also unable to handle confidential information, such as passwords, payment details, and CAPTCHA challenges. If it runs into a website requiring a login or payment card, it will ask you to take over.\n\nFurther, Operator will refuse to carry out certain sensitive tasks, such as depositing money online or submitting a job application. It will also ask for approval before completing other types of tasks, such as submitting an online order or sending an email.\n\nAlso: Have a genealogy mystery? How I used AI to solve a family puzzle\n\nPrivacy is always a concern, especially with AI. To better protect your privacy, you can opt out of training so that Operator won't use your data for learning. You're also able to delete all browsing data, log out of all sites, and erase past conversations by going to the Privacy section in Operator's settings.\n\nSecurity is another worrisome area. How will cybercriminals and hackers be prevented from exploiting and abusing Operator?\n\nFirst, the AI is designed to refuse harmful requests and block prohibited content. Second, it will detect and ignore prompt injections in which hackers try to feed malicious information disguised as legitimate requests. Third, a built-in monitor looks out for suspicious behavior and will pause the task if such behavior is detected. Fourth, OpenAI will use both automated and human reviewers to watch for possible threats.\n\nOf course, other privacy and security issues will likely pop up as Operator wends its way through the ChatGPT Pro community. That's the purpose of limiting its initial use to just Pro subscribers before looking to expand to a wider audience.\n\nOperator uses a new model\n\nTo carry out tasks on the web, Operator uses a new model called Computer-Using Agent (CUA), which combines GPT-4o's vision skills with more advanced reasoning. That combination lets it interact with the menus, controls, and text fields on a web page without the need for a custom API.\n\nAlso: The best AI chatbots\n\n\"Operator can be asked to handle a wide variety of repetitive browser tasks such as filling out forms, ordering groceries, and even creating memes,\" OpenAI said in its news release. \"The ability to use the same interfaces and tools that humans interact with on a daily basis broadens the utility of AI, helping people save time on everyday tasks while opening up new engagement opportunities for businesses.\""

OpenAI added that Operator would be first available as a research preview within the $200 ChatGPT Pro subscription plan.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nEnthusiasts have now discovered recent information about the tool that suggest that it may in fact be close to launch, and that the information OpenAI previously shared is correct. An X user by the name of Choi, discovered updates to the client-side code of ChatCPT, which was later verified by TechCrunch.\n\nThe code includes several references to the URL operator.chatgpt.com\u2013 a live page that redirects to the chatgpt.com main page if you interact with any of the it\u2019s content.\n\nThe code details that there will be a popup within ChatGPT, explaining how you can access Operator, which will read \u201cOperator is currently only available to Pro users as an early research preview.\u201d OpenAI will also add \u201caccess to research preview of Operator,\u201d to the list of perks of the ChatGPT Pro plan.\n\nAccording to The Information, the tool works similar to most AI services, starting with a prompt. From there, Operator will be able to take care of the rest of the function. Users can imagine Operator completing tasks such researching travel and activities, or completing productivity tasks within commonly used programs and services, such as Asana, LinkedIn, or Salesforce. The publication noted that Operator could be available before the week\u2019s end. Hopefully with a release, OpenAI will have more to say about the tool and its underlying technology.\n\nNotably, OpenAI\u2019s Operator has its competitors. Anthropic recently released its \u201cComputer Use\u201d API that is currently a developer\u2019s beta. Google also announced its own AI Agents in December 2024 as an experimental tool."

            "article_content": "GUEST OPINION: The retail landscape is undergoing a remarkable transformation fueled by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). From physical storefronts to digital platforms, AI is revolutionizing the industry, reshaping operations, and redefining customer experiences. But what lies ahead for the future of AI in the retail industry ?\n\nLet\u2019s explore the key trends and innovations driving this change.\n\nWhat does AI mean for retail?\n\nArtificial intelligence refers to the capability of machines to perform tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence, such as data analysis and decision-making. Its integration into the retail sector is unlocking unprecedented levels of efficiency and customer satisfaction. Whether online or offline, AI is paving the way for a smarter, more responsive, and customer-focused retail experience.\n\nAI transformations in online retail\n\nIn the e-commerce space, AI is centred on enhancing personalization and streamlining customer interactions. By analyzing massive amounts of customer data - from browsing history to purchase behaviour - AI delivers tailored experiences that feel intuitive and engaging. Tools like recommendation systems, AI chatbots, and visual search technologies create a seamless shopping journey.\n\nConsumers benefit from faster, more convenient interactions, while retailers enjoy higher conversion rates and increased sales. These innovations underscore the growing importance of the future of AI in the retail industry for e-commerce.\n\nAI\u2019s role in physical retail\n\nAI\u2019s influence is not limited to online platforms. Physical stores are leveraging AI-powered tools such as cameras and sensors to optimize operations and enhance customer experiences. These technologies monitor foot traffic, track inventory levels, and provide real-time product recommendations.\n\nFor shoppers, this translates to a more personalized and efficient experience, bridging the gap between the convenience of digital platforms and the tactile benefits of in-store shopping. Such advancements illustrate how the future of AI in the retail industry is shaping brick-and-mortar spaces.\n\nEmerging trends in AI for retail\n\nAccording to a study by Fortune Business Insights, the global AI market in retail, valued at $4.84 billion in 2021, is projected to reach an astounding $52.94 billion by 2029. This exponential growth highlights several transformative trends.\n\nAI for retail automation\n\nRepetitive tasks like inventory tracking, pricing updates, and customer support are prime candidates for AI automation. By automating these processes, retailers can focus on strategic priorities and reduce operational inefficiencies.\n\nAI tools excel at analyzing sales data to identify trends, forecast demand, and optimize inventory management. They also simplify catalogue updates, ensuring product descriptions, availability, and pricing remain accurate across platforms.\n\nAI for customer service\n\nIn today\u2019s competitive market, superior customer service is essential. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are revolutionizing online retail by offering 24/7, human-like support. These tools handle customer inquiries, guide users through purchases, and personalize interactions based on past behaviours.\n\nIn physical stores, smart kiosks and mobile apps enhance customer engagement. Features like facial recognition enable real-time, personalized assistance, taking customer service to the next level.\n\nAI for retail personalization\n\nPersonalization is a cornerstone of the future of AI in the retail industry. Advanced AI technologies like natural language processing, visual search, and voice recognition help online shoppers find desired products quickly, providing a seamless experience.\n\nIn-store, AI-driven automated checkout systems simplify the payment process. By using computer vision and image recognition, these systems eliminate the need for traditional checkouts, enhancing convenience and hygiene for customers.\n\nAI for supply chain optimization\n\nEfficient supply chain management is another area where AI is making waves. By analyzing data on traffic, weather, and delivery schedules, AI tools optimize transportation routes, ensuring timely deliveries and reducing costs.\n\nAdditionally, AI enables real-time tracking and demand forecasting, helping retailers align stock levels with customer needs, minimizing delays, and improving overall logistics.\n\nAI for loss prevention\n\nAI is reshaping retail security by leveraging technologies like facial recognition and predictive analytics. These tools identify potential theft risks and monitor suspicious behaviour, enabling proactive loss prevention strategies. Predictive analytics also helps retailers design store layouts and allocate resources effectively, reducing shrinkage and improving overall security.\n\nReal-world application: Amazon Go\n\nAmazon Go provides a glimpse into the future of AI in the retail industry. These cashierless stores utilize cutting-edge AI technologies, including computer vision, IoT sensors, and deep learning algorithms, to create a seamless shopping experience. Shoppers can enter the store using a QR code, select items, and exit without waiting in line. Payments are processed automatically, showcasing how AI can redefine convenience and efficiency in retail.\n\nEmpower your retail business with Sky Solution\n\nLooking to prepare your business for the future of AI in the retail industry?

            "article_content": "Weddings are a vibe check for the couple tying the knot. They reflect not just love stories but also style, culture, and a whole lot of personality. But let\u2019s be real\u2014wedding trends often feel like they\u2019re on a loop, with the same Pinterest boards recycled year after year. Not in 2025, though. This year, couples are rewriting the rules in ways that feel fresh, unexpected, and unapologetically them.\n\nGone are the days of rigid traditions. Weddings now? They\u2019re immersive experiences, designed to make every guest feel something\u2014whether it\u2019s a jaw-dropping first look or a cocktail hour that feels more like an intimate backyard hangout than a stuffy meet-and-greet. Let\u2019s get into what\u2019s really shaking up weddings this year.\n\nInvitations Are Getting the Main Character Energy\n\nYou know the saying, \u201cFirst impressions matter\u201d? Well, in 2025, that energy starts before the ceremony. It\u2019s all about your wedding invitations setting the stage for what\u2019s to come. And we\u2019re not just talking about a cute font and a pressed flower here.\n\nThink bold color palettes that scream individuality. Neon accents, unexpected textures, and even QR codes are making an appearance\u2014not in a tacky way, but in a wow-they-really-thought-of-everything kind of way. The goal? Guests should feel like they\u2019re opening a sneak peek into your love story. The first thing you send out? Wedding save the dates. They\u2019re less about simply marking a calendar and more about hyping up the event itself. From digital animations to hand-painted postcards, these little previews are what make your crew count down the days.\n\nThe Ceremony Space Is the New Art Installation\n\nMinimalist decor is taking a backseat to something far more memorable: bold, artistic ceremony setups that feel like walking into an exhibit. Couples are ditching the classic arch for custom backdrops, sculptural installations, and oversized florals that look more avant-garde than bridal shops. And it\u2019s not just the visuals; it\u2019s the vibes.\n\nPicture this: a string quartet remixing pop songs as guests find their seats, or handwritten poetry scattered on chairs for everyone to discover. It\u2019s like a love letter from the couple to their people, with every detail designed to give off that \u201cyou had to be there\u201d energy. In 2025, the ceremony space isn\u2019t just a setting; it\u2019s a statement.\n\nReception Tables Aren\u2019t Playing It Safe\n\nForget those matchy-matchy centerpieces you\u2019ve seen a million times. This year\u2019s tablescapes are all about texture and individuality. One table might have lush greenery draped down its center, while the next one plays with dried flowers and vintage glassware. It\u2019s like walking into a dinner party where every table tells its own story.\n\nCouples are leaning into mix-and-match everything\u2014linens, chairs, even the tableware. Think hand-thrown ceramic plates alongside sleek gold cutlery, or moody, candlelit vibes that feel straight out of a European bistro. And don\u2019t sleep on interactive tables. Whether it\u2019s a DIY cocktail garnish station or personalized notes from the couple, the reception space is officially breaking free from being just a place to eat.\n\nMicro Weddings Are Still In\u2014But Bigger Isn\u2019t Always Bad\n\nOkay, so micro weddings aren\u2019t new, but in 2025, they\u2019re evolving. Smaller guest lists are sticking around, but the focus has shifted to creating experiences that feel thoughtful and unforgettable. This means splurging on things like custom menus, unique venues, or destination weddings.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist: larger celebrations are making a quiet comeback, too. The key difference? These bigger weddings don\u2019t feel chaotic or impersonal. Couples are curating their guest lists and choosing venues that offer intimacy, even with more people in the room. Whether it\u2019s a backyard bash for 30 or a black-tie soir\u00e9e for 200, the focus is on creating moments that feel intentional.\n\nOutfits Are All About Self-Expression\n\nWedding fashion is shedding its one-size-fits-all image and embracing individuality. Brides are swapping traditional gowns for colorful, patterned, or even two-piece ensembles that make them feel like the main character they are. Grooms, meanwhile, are stepping up their game with tailored suits in unexpected hues, bold accessories, and even textured fabrics like velvet.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the guests. Wedding attire in 2025 is less about following a strict dress code and more about showing up in something that feels authentic. Couples are even leaning into themes\u2014whether it\u2019s a roaring \u201820s vibe or a casual cocktail dress code\u2014to set the tone for the day.\n\nFood and Drinks Are Full-On Experiences\n\nGone are the days of chicken-or-fish menus and predictable signature cocktails. Wedding food in 2025 is about as creative as it gets. Think chef-led tasting menus, tableside preparations, and food trucks offering everything from late-night tacos to artisanal gelato. It\u2019s less about filling bellies and more about creating memories through the food.\n\nDrinks, too, are having a moment. Couples are hiring mixologists to craft personalized cocktail menus, complete with drinks inspired by their story. Guests might even find a little note at their table explaining why the spicy margarita is a nod to the couple\u2019s first date or why the espresso martini is a non-negotiable. It\u2019s thoughtful, it\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s guaranteed to keep the dance floor buzzing.\n\nWeddings in 2025? Pure Magic\n\nWeddings this year aren\u2019t about following trends\u2014they\u2019re about breaking them. The goal isn\u2019t perfection; it\u2019s creating a celebration that feels as unique and meaningful as the couple at the center of it all. Whether that\u2019s an intimate backyard ceremony or a full-on bash at a dream destination, 2025 is proving that the only real rule is to do it your way.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re tying the knot this year, remember: it\u2019s not about outdoing anyone else. It\u2019s about leaning into what makes your love story worth celebrating."

This ensures that only high-potential leads are prioritized, saving time and resources while optimizing your sales funnel.\n\n2: Crafting Personalized Outreach\n\nEffective sales communication hinges on personalization, and your AI agent excels in this area. It generates customized call scripts and initiates voice calls using AI-powered voice assistants.

These workflows are triggered by lead form submissions collected through tools like Typeform. Once a form is submitted, the system uses platforms like Relevance AI and Make.com to integrate various tools for data extraction, communication, and CRM updates.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe agent scrapes LinkedIn for detailed lead information.\n\nIt updates your CRM with the newly gathered data.\n\nIt sends a personalized email or LinkedIn message to the lead.\n\nThis automated process ensures that no lead is overlooked, allowing efficient follow-ups and streamlined communication.

When local standard time is about to reach 2 a.m., the time will roll ahead to 3 a.m., beginning Daylight Saving Time.\n\nAs a result, sunrise and sunset will be about 1 hour later on March 9 than on March 8. There will be more light in the evening and less light in the morning.\n\nMarch 9 will be a 23-hour day in nearly every state in the United States and several other countries around the globe. Hawaii doesn\u2019t observe Daylight Saving Time. A small part of Arizona observes the time change, but the bulk of that state also will remain on standard time.\n\nDaylight Saving Time was initiated as an energy-saving measure in World War I and then again in World War II. Permanent daylight-saving time was briefly enacted by President Richard Nixon in 1974 following the 1973 oil embargo crisis.\n\nNow the time change is fixed in federal law, starting the second Sunday in March and ending the first Sunday in November, despite some legislative efforts to end the practice.\n\nThat\u2019s why the time change this year is one of the earliest dates possible.\n\nIn 2026 it will start March 8 and end Nov. 1, the earliest dates it can start and end. In 2027 it will begin March 14 and end Nov. 7, the latest dates it can start and end.\n\nCritics question whether changing the clocks effectively saves any energy. Health experts suggest that switching back and forth can disrupt sleep schedules and affect individual health.\n\nA poll conducted in 2020 by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that 63% of Americans favor ending seasonal time changes."

John Moore/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump is moving quickly to implement his immigration agenda during his first week in office.\n\nWithin hours of becoming president, Trump signed a spate of executive actions that have already had wide-ranging impacts for people both inside and outside the US. By Wednesday, incoming refugee flights were canceled, troops were moving to the border, federal authorities were given permission to arrest people in or near schools and churches and the pool of undocumented immigrants eligible for quick deportation without a judicial hearing was expanded.\n\nHere are some of the latest developments following Trump\u2019s executive actions:\n\nIncrease in US-bound migrants: Approximately 300 migrants have arrived into the northeast Mexican border state of Tamaulipas since Trump was sworn in, with many thinking they would be able to cross into the US legally only to find their appointments canceled, according to a state official.\n\nThe region is seeing a steady increase in migrants arriving from southern Mexico, Haiti, Venezuela and Central America, according to Juan Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, director of the Institute for Migrants of Tamaulipas, a state agency tasked with receiving and supporting migrants after they\u2019re ordered returned to Mexico.\n\nRodr\u00edguez explains that a majority of the new arrivals came expecting to cross the Rio Grande into Texas for appointments on the now deactivated CBP One app.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hope here,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez. \u201cBut all we can do it is offer them shelter and humanitarian support as they figure out their next move.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, he told CNN that during the first few days of the second Trump administration, deportations have remained steady and similar to rates under Biden \u2014 about 150 people a day.\n\nNew directive: Benjamine Huffman, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s acting secretary, issued a directive Thursday to give the Justice Department\u2019s law enforcement agencies authority to investigate and arrest unlawful immigrants in the US. The agencies include the FBI, US Drug Enforcement Administration; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; US Marshals Service and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nA call for reimbursement: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sent letters to US Congressional Leadership and the entire Texas Congressional Delegation Thursday requesting the federal government reimburse Texas for the more than $11.1 billion in Texas taxpayer money spent to secure the border due to what he says is the Biden Administration\u2019s refusal to do its job for the last four years.\n\nTrump speaks with El Salvadoran president: Donald Trump spoke Thursday with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador and discussed immigration and transnational gangs, the White House said. On the call, the two leaders focused on enhancing bilateral cooperation to address illegal immigration and combat the growing influence of transnational gangs, specifically the notorious Tren de Aragua, according to a White House readout. Trump also praised President Bukele for his strong leadership in El Salvador and the region, the readout said."

            "article_content": "FOB China prices for Mono PERC wafers remained steady this week, with Mono PERC M10 and G12 wafers priced at $0.144 per pc and $0.208/pc, respectively. Meanwhile, FOB China prices for n-type M10 and G12 wafers experienced slight increases, reaching $0.149/pc and $0.196/pc, respectively, reflecting a growth of 2.05% and 1.55% compared to the previous week.\n\nSince the start of 2025, n-type wafer prices have risen for three consecutive weeks, driven by production cuts and lower inventory levels. Large-scale production cuts by wafer companies since Q3 2024 have effectively reduced market inventory to about two weeks of production, significantly lower than the inventory levels of polysilicon and modules.\n\nThese developments have led wafer companies to raise their operating rates since early January, with the overall average now exceeding 50%. As a result, January wafer output is expected to reach approximately 46 GW, up 5.5% from 43.61 GW in October 2024.\n\nThe sustainability of the wafer price increase depends on a potential rebound in solar cell transaction prices, industry participants note. They also caution that wafer operating rates in the coming weeks will be critical. A significant rise in operating rates driven by higher prices could risk price drops after the Chinese New Year, as the current vast production capacity may quickly drive inventory levels back to high levels.\n\nAnother recent trend in the Chinese market is the sluggish sales of rectangular G12R (182 mm x 210 mm) wafers, which have driven prices downward. Sources attribute this to the rapid production ramp-up of this size across both upstream and downstream segments, surpassing its adoption by end users. Consequently, an oversupply of this specification has developed before it could gain traction as a mainstream product.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security expanded its ban list of China-based entities, adding four ingot and wafer manufacturers, including a subsidiary of a prominent solar integrated manufacturer. The action was taken on the grounds that these entities were found to source polysilicon from regions in China that do not comply with traceability requirements.\n\nInsiders widely believe that this U.S. decision will theoretically support increased demand for global polysilicon, though its impact has not yet been fully realized. It is also expected to further hinder the export of Chinese wafers and the modules derived from these wafer suppliers to the U.S. With these manufacturers excluded from the U.S. export market, reduced competition may stabilize or even increase wafer and module prices in the U.S. This move aligns with prior market expectations and reflects the U.S.\u2019 strategic intent to implement energy-related policies aimed at minimizing reliance on components associated with China.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury updated safe harbor tables this week, introducing new default component cost percentages to account for the premium customers will pay for U.S.-made wafers, aiming to incentivize domestic wafer manufacturing. The bonus is seen as a \u201cdirect complement\u201d to the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit. While the inclusion of wafers in the guidance is considered significant, industry players remain skeptical about its impact on procurement activities or wafer manufacturing plans in the U.S.\n\nOPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities. It acquired pricing data assets from Singapore Solar Exchange in 2022 and now publishes the OPIS APAC Solar Weekly Report.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own, and do not necessarily reflect those held by pv magazine."

Now, Google has bought part of HTC Vive's engineering team, HTC Vive of course having ample experience engineering VR headsets.\n\nGoogle says this handover of engineers is \"subject to customary closing conditions\" and emphasises that they are \"an incredibly strong technical team with a proven track record in the VR space, and we are looking forward to working with them to accelerate the development of the Android XR platform across the headsets and glasses ecosystem.\"\n\nWith Android XR, Google is intending to \"create a vibrant ecosystem of developers and device makers for Android XR.\" The OS itself should enable you to do all the kinds of MR (mixed reality) things that got people so initially hyped over the Vision Pro.\n\nGoogle explains: \"You can fill the space around you with apps and content, and with Gemini, our AI assistant, you can even have conversations about what you're seeing or control your device. Gemini can understand your intent, helping you plan, research topics and guide you through tasks.\"\n\nPlus, you know, all the usual 'watch videos on a giant screen that's not really there' business\u2014which I'd love to hate but can't help but quietly covet.\n\nYouTube Watch On\n\nGoogle's not a stranger to the industry, although it's been a decade since its first attempt at smart glasses was abandoned, and its later Google Glass reboot ended in 2023. Hype for XR\u2014especially for AR\u2014does seem to be hotting up, after all, with projects like Meta's Orion offering a glimpse of an increasingly digitally enmeshed future.\n\nThough with Android XR it's teaming up with Samsung for what is our first glimpse of actual hardware. Project Moohan is the name, and XR is the game.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWith Android XR, all signs point to Google looking to compete with Meta on on the XR ecosystem front.\n\nMeta's Horizon VR operating system is included on its Quest headsets, such as the Quest 3. Though that's all changing soon. Soon it will be available to third parties\u2014it looks like Asus will be the first third-party manufacturer to use it.\n\nMuch in the same way that different Android device manufacturers must cede to the Google Play Store, Meta Horizon becoming the default OS for third-party VR and MR headsets and glasses could mean such device manufacturers needing to cede to a Horizon OS store.\n\nVirtual reality (Image credit: Valve) Best VR headset: which kit should you choose?\n\nBest graphics card: you need serious GPU power for VR\n\nBest gaming laptop: don't get tied to your desktop in VR\n\nIn other words, it's possible that Meta could become to the VR ecosystem what Google is to the Android ecosystem, and Horizon being open to third-party devices is a step in this direction.\n\nIt's powerful to have your store at the centre of the \"next computing platform\", if that is how you feel about mixed reality. Meta definitely feels this way, it's said so.\n\nGoogle might be pushing along similar lines here, hoping to compete in the VR OS/store ecosystem space. Talk of a \"vibrant ecosystem of developers and device makers\" certainly leans in this direction, as does Android XR's partnership with Qualcomm in particular\u2014standalone VR headsets tend to use Arm chips such as Snapdragons from Qualcomm.\n\nWho knows, maybe the next few years will see Meta and Google vying for proprietary ecosystem adoption across the VR space. Interesting times ahead."

            "source": "Security Boulevard",
            "article_content": "When I started working with cloud architecture a decade ago, running critical workloads across multiple cloud providers would have seemed needlessly complex. Today, it\u2019s becoming the norm. Companies are embracing multi-cloud strategies not just because they want to avoid vendor lock-in, but because different providers excel at other things. The challenge? Security becomes exponentially more difficult when you\u2019re working across distributed architectures. After years of building cloud-based applications for global enterprises, I\u2019ve learned that the old perimeter-based security models just don\u2019t cut it anymore \u2013 we need a new framework that tackles architectural security and compliance head-on.\n\nThe adoption of multi-cloud deployments presents challenges that extend far beyond simple workload distribution. Each cloud provider brings security models, compliance certifications and native services. This diversity offers powerful capabilities but creates significant hurdles in maintaining consistent security controls and compliance standards across environments.\n\nEncyption Challenge\n\nOne significant challenge I\u2019ve faced was ensuring consistent encryption standards across AWS and other cloud providers for a data analytics pipeline. The project involved processing sensitive customer data, and we needed to maintain end-to-end encryption while leveraging services from both clouds. This challenge was solved by implementing a custom key management service that integrated with AWS KMS and the other providers\u2019 key management solution, allowing for a single source of truth for encryption keys. At the same time, ensuring data remained protected as it moved between cloud environments.\n\nThis encryption challenge highlighted a broader truth about multi-cloud architectures: Identity and access management form the cornerstone of secure cross-cloud operations. The secure multi-cloud architecture is built around one core thing: Unified identity management. Organizations can\u2019t easily manage identities across the multitude of cloud services they use when each has its identity system. So, to gain efficiency and effectiveness, and to have a semblance of personality across the cloud, organizations need a way to manage all those identities (and all those accesses) in a unified manner. If you get it right, that setup also provides the comfy feel of perspiration across the entire cloud ecosystem.\n\nMulti-cloud environments necessitate special consideration for data protection. Organizations should set up classification systems that work across all cloud boundaries and ensure that sensitive data is classified and receives the appropriate protection no matter where it is stored or used. This should be done through a seamless, yet secure, infrastructure across the cloud boundary; encryption standards should meet the highest common denominator across the cloud service providers; powerful data residency controls should govern where the data is allowed to live and operate; and a consistent key management strategy throughout the multi-cloud architecture should ensure that only cloud-visible personnel have access to the necessary keys to unlock the data.\n\nThe careful crafting of network security architecture is needed in multi-cloud environments to provide consistent protection while taking advantage of each provider\u2019s strengths. This includes interconnecting the different cloud providers securely and implementing consistent micro-segmentation policies. The outcome we\u2019re looking for is a unified security posture that lets us maintain visibility and control across all the cloud environments we happen to be in.\n\nTo illustrate these network security principles in action, consider our implementation for a high-traffic e-commerce platform. Our platform uses AWS Transit Gateway to implement a hub-and-spoke network architecture that connects multiple VPCs across different AWS regions. We extended this model to include our multi-cloud resources by setting up dedicated interconnects and implementing consistent security groups and NACLs across all environments. We also utilized AWS Network Firewall to create a centralized inspection point for all cross-cloud traffic, allowing us to implement uniform security policies regardless of the traffic\u2019s origin or destination.\n\nThe technical controls alone cannot secure multi-cloud environments. Organizations must conduct cloud security architecture reviews before implementing any multi-cloud solution. These reviews should focus on:\n\nData flow patterns between clouds\n\nAuthentication and authorization requirements\n\nCompliance obligations across all relevant jurisdictions\n\nCompleting these tasks thoroughly and diligently will ensure that multi-cloud security is baked into the architectural layer between the clouds and in the clouds themselves.\n\nWhile thorough architecture reviews establish the foundation, automation brings these security principles to life at scale. Automation provides a major advantage to security operations for multi-cloud environments. By treating infrastructure and security as code, organizations can achieve consistent configurations across clouds, implement automated security testing and enable fast response to security events. This helps with the overall security and operational overhead because it allows us to do more with less and to reduce human error.\n\nOur security operations experienced a substantial enhancement when we moved to automated compliance checks. Still, we did not just throw AWS services at the problem. We engaged our security team deeply in the process. We had them create rules that continuously monitored our multi-cloud environment for compliance with PCI DSS standards. This automation allowed us to detect and remediate misconfigurations in near real-time. If we miss something in the continuous compliance monitoring, we have a CI/CD pipeline check to catch it before changes are deployed. All told, this saves us an impressive number of hours each year. Moreover, it moves us closer to a state in which we can confidently assert that we are compliant, on top of the auditability problems plaguing us previously.\n\nSeveral emerging trends are molding security demands as multi-cloud architectures rapidly develop. The burgeoning edge computing is broadening the security perimeter, whereas cloud-tethered zero trust is becoming the norm. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence and machine learning are being integrated to bolster security monitoring and response capabilities, producing a more proactive security posture.\n\nHow Multi-Cloud Security Might Evolve\n\nBased on my experience working with large-scale distributed systems, I envision the future of multi-cloud security evolving in several key areas:\n\nUnified Security Orchestration: I foresee the development of more sophisticated, cloud-agnostic security orchestration platforms. These will provide a single pane of glass for managing security across all cloud environments, automatically adapting to each provider\u2019s specific implementations while maintaining consistent policies.\n\nAI-Driven Threat Detection: As our systems grow more complex, AI and machine learning will play an increasingly crucial role in identifying and responding to security threats. I expect to see more advanced, self-learning systems that can correlate events across multiple cloud environments to detect sophisticated, distributed attacks that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n\nQuantum-Resistant Encryption: With the looming threat of quantum computing, I anticipate a shift towards implementing quantum-resistant encryption algorithms across all cloud environments. This will be crucial for maintaining long-term data security in a multi-cloud world.\n\nAutomated Compliance Management: The future will likely bring more advanced automation in compliance management. I envision systems that can automatically adjust configurations across multiple clouds to maintain compliance with changing regulations, reducing the manual overhead associated with multi-cloud compliance.\n\nEdge-to-Cloud Security: As edge computing grows, I expect to see more integrated security solutions that seamlessly extend from edge devices through multiple clouds. This will likely involve new protocols and standards for maintaining consistent security postures across highly distributed architectures.\n\nIdentity-Centric Security: I anticipate a shift towards fully identity-centric security models that go beyond current identity and access management. These models will use advanced behavioral analytics and continuous authentication to make access decisions regardless of a resource\u2019s cloud environment.\n\nBlockchain for Multi-Cloud Integrity: I foresee potential applications of blockchain technology for maintaining verifiable audit trails and ensuring data integrity across multi-cloud environments, particularly for highly regulated industries.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can create more resilient, efficient and secure multi-cloud architectures that can adapt to the evolving threat landscape while supporting the growing complexity of modern enterprise applications.\n\nThese emerging trends and future directions aren\u2019t just theoretical possibilities \u2013 they\u2019re essential steps for organizations building secure multi-cloud architectures today. As someone who has witnessed and participated in the transformation of cloud security over the past decade, I\u2019m convinced that success in this space requires technical excellence and strategic foresight. The framework outlined here provides a foundation, but staying ahead of evolving threats and technological capabilities will require continuous adaptation and innovation."

            "article_content": "Getty Image\n\nMuch of the ongoing legal battle between It Ends with Us co-stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni has played out in the public eye through the media. And according to reports, Lively\u2019s legal team is looking to put an end to that trend.\n\nEarlier this week, Justin Baldoni\u2019s lawyer Bryan Freedman released 10-minute footage from the set of It Ends with Us that showcased an intimate scene between Baldoni\u2019s and Blake Lively\u2019s characters being filmed.\n\nWhile Freedman believed the footage exonerated his client, Lively\u2019s legal time responded by saying \u201cevery frame of the released footage corroborates, to the letter, what Ms. Lively described\u201d in her complaint alleging sexual harassment.\n\nIn the days since the publication of the footage, Lively\u2019s legal team has taken steps to block Baldoni\u2019s team from pulling a move like this again, arguing that Freedman is leaking sensitive \u201cdiscovery materials,\u201d otherwise known as evidence.\n\n\u201cIn response, Lively\u2019s lawyers accused Freedman of selectively leaking discovery materials, and asked Judge Lewis J. Liman to set a hearing to \u2018address the appropriate conduct of counsel.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSources in Baldoni\u2019s camp argued that it would be \u2018grossly unfair\u2019 to gag Freedman, given that he is simply defending his client from Lively\u2019s defamatory \u2018takedown campaign,\u2019 which was launched in the form of a lengthy article in the New York Times. Baldoni\u2019s team plans to set up a website to release more information to rebut Lively\u2019s accusations. [via Variety]\n\nTo be clear, Lively\u2019s team is not seeking a gag order that bar sBaldoni\u2019s lawyers from speaking to the press entirely, as the New York Rules of Professional Conduct allows for attorneys to make statements on their clients behalf through the media.\n\nWhat Lively\u2019s team is looking to stop is the release of discovery materials in the case, such as the 10-minute raw footage from the set of It Ends with Us that was published earlier this week. They\u2019re also trying to get the judge to enforce a state rule that prevents lawyers from making statements that could prejudice a jury.\n\n\u201cThe Lively Parties\u2019 desire to force the Wayfarer Parties to defend themselves privately against allegations made publicly is not a proper basis for a gag order,\u201d Kevin Fritz, another attorney for Baldoni, said in a statement. \u201cIt is tactical gamesmanship, and it is outrageous. If, as the Lively Parties\u2019 letter suggests, such a protective order is formally requested, it should be denied.\u201d\n\nLast week, Baldoni sued Lively, husband Ryan Reynolds and their publicist Leslie Sloane for $400 million in damages, alleging civil extortion and defamation. This follows Lively filing a complain in California in December that alleged Baldoni sexually harassed her and behaved inappropriately on the set of It Ends with Us."

            "article_content": "One of the key factors for the sustenance of eight billion people globally has been agriculture, and that sector, in turn, has been fuelled by fertilisers such as ammonia. However, due to high volumes, ammonia production contributes significantly to carbon emissions.\n\nBut this is likely to soon change.\n\nA new study published in scientific journal Joule has revealed a new ground-breaking method to produce ammonia under moderate subsurface conditions. Many believe this could impact the agriculture sector the world over and even reduce carbon emissions.\n\nAmmonia is a critical component of fertilisers and an emerging green fuel. For over a century it was produced by using Haber-Bosch process under high temperature and pressure.\n\nThe report claims ammonia can be produced in Earth\u2019s subsurface as it houses similar conditions, in turn offering a sustainable and energy-efficient alternative.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings have prompted the creation of Addis Energy, a company aiming to commercialise the process. Speaking to MIT Technology Review, Addis Energy\u2019s CEO Mark Bennett said, \u201cOur technology has the potential to address the dual challenges of food security and climate change by revolutionising ammonia production.\u201d\n\nAmmonia: Key to food systems and clean energy\n\nAmmonia is essential for modern agriculture, with most fertilisers relying on this compound to boost crop yields. However, the current Haber-Bosch process used to produce ammonia is highly energy-intensive, consuming 1-2% of global energy annually and emitting about 1.8% of global carbon dioxide. This dependence on fossil fuels has drawn widespread criticism as industries worldwide now face an increasing pressure to \u201cdecarbonise.\u201d\n\nThe discovery opens new possibilities for using naturally occurring chemical reactions to produce ammonia at lower energy inputs. The research team demonstrated that nitrogen and hydrogen react with specific minerals to form ammonia, mimicking subsurface geological processes.\n\nThe lead researcher, Dr Emily Rhodes, explained, \u201cThis method not only replicates natural processes but also provides an opportunity to dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of ammonia production.\u201d\n\nBroader applications and industry impact\n\nThe implications extend beyond agriculture. Ammonia is also emerging as a clean fuel for sectors like shipping, where its high energy density and zero carbon emissions make it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. This breakthrough could accelerate ammonia\u2019s adoption by addressing one of its major drawbacks: The emissions associated with its production.\n\nThe formation of Addis Energy highlights the growing focus on translating scientific discoveries into industrial applications. Bennett noted that the company aims to build pilot facilities to demonstrate the technology\u2019s scalability. \u201cOur priority is to ensure the process is not only environmentally sustainable but also economically competitive with existing methods,\u201d he said.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nWhile the technology shows promise, significant challenges remain. Scaling the process from the lab to commercial operations will require substantial investment and validation. Additionally, existing infrastructure tailored to the Haber-Bosch method may need significant adaptations to accommodate this new approach.\n\nExperts also point to the regulatory landscape as a key factor. Any new ammonia production technology must meet strict safety and environmental standards, particularly as the chemical has dual-use applications in agriculture and energy.\n\nA step towards sustainability\n\nThis discovery aligns with broader global efforts to reduce industrial emissions and transition to sustainable energy systems. If successful, Addis Energy\u2019s innovation could reshape two major industries \u2014 agriculture and shipping \u2014 while contributing to climate goals.\n\nDr Rhodes emphasised the potential impact: \u201cThis is a pivotal step toward transforming a vital yet carbon-intensive process into one that aligns with a sustainable future.\u201d\n\nThe next decade will determine whether this breakthrough can move from promise to practice, but its potential to drive change is undeniable."
