            "article_content": "The recent congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly known as UFOs, has ignited a call for transparency from lawmakers across the political spectrum.\n\nDuring the hearing, Chairwoman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, Nancy Mace, said:\n\n\u201cI obviously would like to know how much taxpayers are spending on this. You have the right to know. And if we are spending money on something that doesn\u2019t exist, why are we spending the money? And if it does exist, why are we hiding it from the public? Of course, national security is a big issue and if there is technology that could harm us or our allies that are in the hands of our adversaries, we obviously want to stay ahead of that to the best of our abilities.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Defense, which oversees UAP research, is set to receive a proposed budget of $850 billion in 2025. However, the exact amount spent on UAP research remains unclear, contributing to congressional frustration over the perceived secrecy surrounding the issue. The Department of Defense\u2019s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established in 2022, is tasked with investigating these phenomena.\n\nA group of bipartisan lawmakers in Congress introduced the UAP Transparency Act, which would require the declassification of all federal documents related to UAPs. The bill mandates that the president instruct federal agencies to release UAP research documents to the public within 270 days and provide Congress with quarterly progress reports. The UAP Transparency Act was referred to the House Oversight and Accountability Committee in May, but no further action has been taken.\n\nAARO reviewed 757 new UAP reports between May 2023 and June 2024, identifying 21 cases that \u201cmerit further analysis\u201d due to their \u201canomalous characteristics and/or behaviors.\u201d Despite these findings, AARO\u2019s report stated there is no evidence to suggest extraterrestrial life is responsible for these sightings.\n\n\u201cThere are interesting cases that I, with my physics and engineering background and time in the intelligence community, do not understand. And I don\u2019t know anybody else who understands them either,\u201d said Jon Kosloski, the director of AARO.\n\nHave a news tip? Contact Emma Withrow at ewithrow@sbgtv.com or at x.com/emma_withrow.

            "article_content": "(Stacker) - When pilot Kenneth Arnold took off from Chehalis, Washington, in his single-engine airplane one afternoon in June 1947, he was looking for a lost military aircraft that had crashed. But what he found was something completely different\u2014something that would set off a cultural obsession in the U.S. that persists today.\n\nWhile flying around Mount Rainier, Arnold reportedly encountered nine curious, wingless objects speeding through the sky at 1,200 mph, faster than any plane at the time could. Arnold spent years afterward trying to describe what he had seen, reportedly using a term that has been ingrained in the American lexicon ever since: \"flying saucer.\"\n\nSince then, Americans have been uniquely fixated on the idea that aliens are somewhere in the sky above us\u2014and the number who believe that to be true is growing. In 2019, a Gallup survey found that 33% of Americans believed some UFOs were alien spacecrafts, while 60% felt they could all be explained by human activity or some natural phenomenon. Just two years later, in 2021, 41% of respondents said they believed at least some UFOs were alien-related compared to 50% who were confident any sightings could be explained by human behavior or scientific events.\n\nThere are two main reasons that belief in aliens has become so prevalent in the United States: government hearings and pop culture.\n\nAmerica\u2019s film industry has always been one of the most influential in the world, and a wave of science fiction films in the 1950s, like \u201cThe Day the Earth Stood Still\u201d and \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d perpetuated the idea that there are other life-forms out there. This continues today with alien-centric sci-fi staples like the \u201cAvatar\u201d franchise and the \u201cQuiet Place\u201d movies dominating the box office.\n\nRather than leave flying saucers to the domain of Hollywood, the U.S. government has addressed the question of UFOs, only adding further speculation. In April 2020, the Department of Defense released multiple videos filmed by military pilots that were thought to possibly capture UFOs. In July 2023, an Air Force veteran came forward to the House of Representatives claiming that the U.S. military has been keeping important information on \u201cnonhuman\u201d sightings secret since the 1930s.\n\nJust like it did in the 1950s amid Cold War paranoia, the lore of UFOs is also currently experiencing a resurgence as many Americans grow concerned about national security. The infamous Chinese spy balloon panic in 2023 and fears over being infiltrated by the Russian government have led to many reporting seeing UFOs in the sky. People are also mistaking the spike in Starlink satellites for extraterrestrial activity. In November 2024, the Pentagon announced that most reported sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs, as they\u2019re now known) can be attributed to balloons, drones, and other regular objects, while still noting that many objects lack a sufficient explanation.\n\nUAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it\u2019s easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they\u2019ve seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWhile New Mexico and Nevada are perhaps best known for UFO sightings, the National UFO Reporting Center data shows that the state with the most sightings is California, with more than 16,500 reports as of Nov. 21, 2024. But what do the numbers look like in your metro area?\n\nStacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Wisconsin using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis.\n\nFor now, the U.S. government\u2019s official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America\u2019s alien obsession.\n\nNote: The images in this article are stock photos and do not necessarily depict the specific cities or events described listed.\n\nSergey Tinyakov // Shutterstock\n\n#10.

One expert explained that the lights were only a phenomenon that shows nothing but a reflection in the night sky.\n\nAn ominous quartet of gleaming lights above the US Capitol building, like landing lights on some otherworldly craft, have left some afraid the alien invasion has finally arrived.

            "article_content": "Every Friday night in the early months of 1994, Channel 4 took British viewers on a trip into The Unpleasant World of Penn & Teller. Each week, the American duo \u2013 Teller, the mononymous mag\u00ad\u00adi\u00adcian, and Penn Jillette, with his ironic patter and pony-tail \u2013 would fill the screen with their irreverent take on the traditional stage \u00admagic show, including a notoriously blood-spattered skit in which Teller was power-sawed in half. They are a little older now (Penn is 69, Teller, 76), but here we are, a stone\u2019s throw from the Houses of Parliament, talking about the 50th anniversary of their partnership, which they\u2019ll celebrate next year with 11 nights at the London Palladium.\n\nFor many years, both men have lived and worked in Las Vegas, where they have the longest-\u00adrunning residency in the casino city. So far, they\u2019ve shown no desire to join the celebrities planning to quit the US when Donald Trump takes power, although Penn claims to have been on Trump\u2019s \u201chate list\u201d for more than a decade, after describing the future president as a \u201cwhack job\u201d with \u201ccotton candy p--s hair\u201d, in 2012, when he appeared alongside him on The Celebrity Apprentice.\n\n\u201cI know Trump,\u201d Penn tells me. \u201cI know him very well. And I have a great deal of tolerance for people who are off the bell curve: I have very close friends who are neuro\u00addiverse in some pretty intense ways. When I worked on The Celebrity Apprentice, Donald Trump Jr said to me, \u2018You seem like the only person who actually likes my father.\u2019 And I want to cop to that. But what Trump cannot understand is how I could be comfortable with him working at a TV show, and not comfortable with him as president of the United States.\u201d Trump, he continues, \u201cis bordering on stupid\u201d.\n\nAnd yet Penn\u2019s compatriots have voted overwhelmingly to put him back in the White House. \u201cIt was [Apprentice network] NBC that did it, and also it was the internet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you have people who are brimming with hate and you tell them that that\u2019s OK, I think it really explodes.\u201d His anxiety about \u201ctrolls and robots\u201d runs deep, but he notes, wryly, that \u201cthe internet, although it may have destroyed America and will be destroying the world, I think, is nothing but good for magic\u201d. It has, he suggests, taken what was an off-puttingly closed world and democratised it.\n\nPenn & Teller have been criticised for revealing the closely guarded secrets of the trade, by, for instance, performing the \u201ccups and balls\u201d trick with clear plastic cups. They\u2019ve been refused membership of the Magic Circle, the famous society of magicians, because of such routines. \u201cThe whole idea of keeping secrets is so offensive,\u201d Penn says. \u201cI love the fact that you can go on the internet and find out how a magic trick is done; pretending that all we have is secrets is an insult. It\u2019s like, if I were to come to you and say, \u2018Here\u2019s the words of the Dylan song, here\u2019s the sheet music, here\u2019s the tuning of his guitar, that\u2019s all you need.\u2019 Well, no, it\u2019s not.\u201d"

Close Read more\n\nA breakthrough brain circuit discovery may lead to new treatments for anxiety and stress disorders, and potentially a pill providing the benefits of yoga.\n\nResearchers from the Salk Institute in the US have discovered the pathway behind voluntary breathing and emotional regulation in mice brains.\n\nTheir study, published recently in the journal Nature Neuroscience, reveals connections between the brain\u2019s more complex regions and the breathing centre of the primitive brainstem which enables breathing coordination with emotional state.\n\nWhile breathing is mainly automatic, human beings and some animals can self-soothe by slowing breathing, an approach that\u2019s a central part of practices like mindfulness and yoga.\n\nHow exactly the brain regulates breathing and how this impacts anxiety and one\u2019s emotional state is little understood. Scientists say only subconscious breathing mechanisms in the brainstem have been thoroughly understood so far.\n\nNeurons in mouse brain behind breathing regulation ( Salk Institute )\n\nIn the new study, researchers set out to find conscious top-down mechanisms connecting emotional regulation and breathing.\n\nThey first assessed a brain connectivity database to probe connections between different brain areas. The analysis revealed a potential breathing circuit connecting a frontal region, called the anterior cingulate cortex, to an intermediate brainstem area, which then connected to the medulla just below.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the medulla, when active, initiates breathing but signals coming down from a brainstem region are known to inhibit this activity and slow down breathing.\n\nResearchers hypothesised that certain emotions or behaviours could lead to the activation of the brainstem region, which in turn could lower activity in the medulla and slower breath.\n\nHow Breathing Exercises Can Reduce Anxiety\n\nTo test the theory, they recorded brain activity in mice when their breathing was altered during activities like sniffing, swimming, and drinking as well as during conditions inducing fear and anxiety.\n\nResearchers found that when the connection between the cortex and the brainstem region was activated, mice were calmer and breathed more slowly.\n\nThis communication decreased when they were in anxiety-inducing situations, and breathing rates went up.\n\nBy following this pathway, researchers discovered a group of neurons in the frontal cortex of the mice brain that connects to the brainstem and governs essential functions like breathing.\n\n8 Foods That Help With Anxiety According To Experts\n\nThis connection, researchers say, enables mice to coordinate their breathing with their current behaviour and emotional state.\n\nFurther analysis of the connection revealed a new set of brain cells and molecules which scientists believe can be targeted with drugs.\n\nResearchers say the findings may lead to long-term solutions for people with anxiety, stress, and panic disorders.\n\n\u201cOur findings got me thinking: could we develop drugs to activate these neurons and manually slow our breathing or prevent hyperventilation in panic disorder?\u201d study co-author Jinho Jhang said.\n\n\u201cI want to use these findings to design a yoga pill. It may sound silly, and the translation of our work into a marketable drug will take years, but we now have a potentially targetable brain circuit for creating therapeutics that could instantly slow breathing and initiate a peaceful, meditative state,\u201d Sung Han, another author of the study, said."

Once you\u2019ve committed to that, it\u2019s important to figure out if you want to purchase a lifetime/one time only deal or if you\u2019re fine paying each year. There are pros and cons here as the yearly subscriptions tend to give you more updates and new features, but you\u2019ll be paying for it.\n\nAlongside that, you need to think about how many people you need a license for. Are you just buying for yourself or do you need to support the whole family? You need a license for each person using Microsoft Office at any one time, so make sure you buy something that works for everyone. Also, think about extras like how much cloud storage is bundled in. For the most part though, it\u2019s a pretty simple process buying Microsoft Office.\n\nHow we chose these Microsoft Office products on Cyber Monday\n\nWe know our way around deals, as well as what\u2019s important with Microsoft Office. We spend every day looking for the best deals, checking out all the major retailers, and comparing prices. Because of that, we know what prices are worth recommending and what should be skipped. In conjunction, we know all about Microsoft Office along with the pros and cons of buying a subscription to 365 or going for a onetime purchase. We can recommend different services for different people with plenty of knowledge backing that view up. Essentially, all the deals above are the kind of deals that we would recommend to our friends and family, and that we would use ourselves. There\u2019s no filler here or any substandard packages. We only include genuinely good products here, which luckily tends to encompass most of what Microsoft Office provides as standard. We also check back regularly and update the deals with the latest best prices."
