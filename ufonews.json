            "article_content": "A drone pilot from New Jersey claims his device lost power and had to descend from restricted airspace, while the mystery flier he was attempting to examine managed to stay in the air despite a signal intended to disable it. The incident took place near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military facility in the state that has recently been the site of many unexplained drone sightings.\n\n\n\nMichael B, a paranormal investigator and podcaster behind the YouTube channel, Terror Talk Productions, was probing a mysterious object he believed was another drone when his device malfunctioned. Speaking to FOX 5 New York, he said, \u201cThere was a drone just hanging out. I had full battery life. Not 3 minutes into the flight, I lost control of the drone.\u201d\n\n\n\nMichael B added he was flying his drone near Picatinny Arsenal when a warning flashed across his screen, and the battery died suddenly. \u201cDrone started going down. Dead battery,\u201d he said. Despite his drone descending, the unknown device he was investigating remained airborne, raising further questions about the incident.\n\n\n\nAlthough it's common for GPS-enabled drones to be grounded or forced to land if they enter restricted airspace, the exact circumstances surrounding the mysterious drone remain unclear. The area around Picatinny Arsenal has seen a rise in reported drone sightings, prompting an official investigation.\n\n\n\nAn army spokesperson confirmed that a temporary flight restriction had been enacted over Picatinny Arsenal, effective until December 26, following the recent spate of drone activity. In response to the sightings, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is also investigating, and additional flight restrictions have been imposed over nearby areas, including the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster.\n\n\n\nThe mystery surrounding the drones has sparked public concern. New Jersey State Senator Joe Pennacchio recently called for a federal investigation and even sent a letter to President-elect Donald Trump, expressing frustration over the lack of answers.\n\n\n\nDespite regulations designed to prevent drones from flying into restricted zones, experts suggest that some drones may have been tampered with or hacked to bypass such restrictions. A few days ago, federal authorities filed charges against a Chinese national for using a modified drone to take photos of Vandenberg Space Force Base, raising further concerns about drone security.\n\n\n\nEven as the origins of the drones over New Jersey remain a mystery, John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser, said, \u201cUpon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmid all this, Laura Ballman, a former CIA operations officer, speculated on Fox News Live that the unidentified drones might be part of a secretive technology test aimed at detecting or avoiding detection."

            "article_content": "In today\u2019s rapidly changing technology landscape, machine learning and AI enable us to redefine industries and change how we interact with the world. AI allows developers to create more intelligent, flexible, and efficient applications. Arm, due to its unique position in the industry, has been enabling AI across a variety of platforms for more than a decade.\n\nIn this article, I want to detail how Arm\u2019s technology allows developers to focus on innovation and the unique aspects of the applications they are developing while utilizing Arm\u2019s existing technology.\n\nYou don\u2019t need an NPU for AI applications For over seven years, I\u2019ve been making content about the advantages and disadvantages of different machine learning accelerators \u2014 called NPUs. These processors have their place in devices, but one myth is that you need one to run machine learning or AI tasks. That\u2019s simply not true. AI tasks don\u2019t hinge exclusively on NPUs; they can run on anything from a CPU to a GPU. With the technology found in Arm v8 and Arm v9 chips, you can run accelerated machine learning tasks particularly well on Arm CPUs.\n\nMatrix multiplication is the key mathematical operation at the heart of machine learning and AI. GPUs and NPUs are good at matrix multiplication. However, modern Arm CPUs are also good at this processing task and have hardware accelerators that enable it, too. Whether it\u2019s Arm v8 or Arm v9, Cortex-A or Cortex-X, or Arm\u2019s Neoverse processors, they all have different technologies that allow the acceleration of matrix multiplication operations.\n\nFor example, Arm\u2019s Neon technology, and Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) are both available in Arm processors, there are also 8-bit matrix-by-matrix multiplication instructions in the Arm instruction set. In smartphones and on the edge devices, Scalable Matrix Extensions (SME) are available inside Arm processors. These technologies allow the CPU to perform accelerated matrix operations without a GPU or NPU.\n\nArm\u2019s Kleidi technology\n\nArm\n\nBeyond the hardware systems, Kleidi is a central part of Arm\u2019s strategy for enabling AI on Arm-based mobile and server platforms. It covers a range of resources and partnerships for helping developers accelerate AI seamlessly on Arm, including a library of high-performance machine learning kernels called KleidiAI, which has been optimized for Arm CPUs using those various hardware accelerators.Kleidi is available on GitLab, and these kernels have been integrated into various frameworks that are ready for developers to use. As a result, we now have hardware acceleration for Arm CPUs, supporting various machine learning technologies, from classical machine learning to current generative AI.\n\nArm has integrated Kleidi technology into popular AI frameworks such as PyTorch and ExecuTorch, resulting in significant out-of-the-box performance improvements for developers. This integration ensures that developers can seamlessly leverage Arm\u2019s optimized libraries within their existing workflows, gaining up to a 12x performance improvement with minimal effort.\n\nArm partnered with Meta to ensure the recently launched Llama 3.2 model works perfectly on Arm CPUs. The availability of smaller LLMs that enable fundamental text-based generative AI workloads, such as the one billion and three billion parameter versions, is critical for enabling AI inference at scale. Arm CPUs can run larger models, such as Llama 3.2 with 11 billion parameters and even the 90 billion parameter model in the cloud. These larger models are an excellent fit for CPU-based inference workloads in the cloud that generate text and images.\n\nThe 11 billion parameter version of Llama 3.2, running on an Amazon AWS Graviton4 processor, can achieve 29.3 tokens per second during the generation phase, and that\u2019s just on the CPU. Thanks to the collaboration between Arm and Meta on the ExecuTorch framework, you can now access optimal performance by running those models on the edge. Running the new Llama 3.2 three billion LLM on an Arm-powered smartphone through the Arm CPU optimizations leads to a 5x improvement in prompt processing and a 3x improvement in token generation, achieving 19.92 tokens per second during the generation phase.\n\nIf you want a demonstration of this, check out my video above.\n\nA massive boost for developers\n\nArm\n\nThanks to these advancements, the possibilities for developers are enormous. Think of everything you could do with a large language model running on a phone using an Arm CPU \u2014 no GPU, no NPU, no cloud, just the CPU. Arm\u2019s approach is performance portability, which means that AI developers can optimize once and then deploy their models across various platforms without making any modifications. This is particularly useful for developers who need to deploy models both on the edge, in a smartphone, and in the cloud. By using Arm, developers can be sure that their model will also perform well on other platforms once optimized for one platform.\n\nArm has some great resources for developers, including documentation on how to accelerate generative AI and ML workloads when you choose to run them on Arm CPUs, in addition to running AI and ML on Android devices."

            "article_content": "Follow us on Image Source : FILE Spam calls\n\nThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has decided to provide relief to 1.2 billion mobile users in the country by addressing the issue of fake calls. In a move aimed at tackling spam communications, the regulator has made significant changes to the rules surrounding commercial communications. A new Do-Not-Disturb (DND) app is set to be introduced, which will empower users to block unwanted commercial calls and messages on their phones.\n\nAs fraudulent activities via fake calls and messages have surged recently, TRAI's decision comes as a timely intervention. Reports suggest that this app could be launched next year. The telecom regulator has asked all stakeholders to assess the technical feasibility of integrating new AI features into the DND app, with a planned rollout occurring two months after stakeholders complete their evaluations.\n\nSince the launch of AI spam filters by telecom companies, around 800 entities and more than 1.8 million mobile numbers have been blocked. Telecom operators are already combating fake calls at the network level using these AI filters. TRAI believes that extending this blocking feature to the user level is essential, which is why upgrading the DND app is necessary.\n\nThe revamped DND app will provide users with better control over their commercial communication preferences. Currently, users can customize their preferences and report spam calls, although action against these calls is initiated by the service providers. The new DND app aims to further limit unsolicited commercial communication.\n\nOriginally launched in 2016, the previous DND app struggled to gain traction among users. With plans to enhance its features, TRAI aims to attract more mobile users to utilize this tool. Additionally, the telecom regulator has made several recent policy changes to effectively combat the rise of fake calls and messages.\n\nALSO READ: Jio, Airtel takes on BSNL, brings new affordable recharge plans to lure frustrated users"

He said he was trying to track a mystery drone but his drone was shut down while the mystery thing remained airborne.\"There was a drone just hanging out,\" he told FOX 5 New York. \"I had full battery life. Not 3 minutes into the flight, I lost control of the drone.\"He said he saw a warning flash across the screen of his controller and the battery died with the drone coming down. He understood that his drone was probably shot down because it was a restricted flight area but the thing that he was trying to approach continued to fly. The paranormal investigator lives near the Picatinny Arsenal, an Army facility near where dozens of sightings have been reported in recent weeks. Since it was an Army area, it was possible that his drone was shut down but the other one continuing to fly seems to establish speculation theories that these mystery drones are probably sanctioned by the government and the Feds are well aware of them.As Michael B shared his horrifying experience with MSNBC, he said the issue, to him, seems more serious than just misidentified aircraft. \"At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,\" he said adding that he could not figure out what it was.Michael B added that it's clear to him that these mystery drones are capable of flying in restricted zones. He said he can usually detect what other objects are on the sky by using his radar, none of these mystery things are on flight radar."

'At one point, it even asked for my phone number and I said, 'Nah. I think we're good at this point.''\n\nWitt asked Michael B: 'What do you think that is? What do you think people are seeing in the sky? And why only at night?'\n\n'At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,' Michael B responded.\n\nThe Terror Talk host also noted that he has technology to detect objects in the sky, 'none of these things that we go after are on flight radar.'\n\nTo demonstrate the government's drone deterrence capabilities, the pilot brought a DJI brand drone to a parking lot near Morristown Airport, a local flight corridor that's achieved national prominence due to Trump's use.

The mystery drone was 'unaffected'\n\nMichael B told MSNBC that he believes the government is keeping the truth about New Jersey's unidentified drones a mystery on purpose.\n\nThe real answers, he said, are likely to be 'secrets that the government don't want us to know [...] either that or aliens.'\n\n'At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,' he told the station.\n\n'What they could be \u2014 I have no idea,' the paranormal investigator admitted, although he emphasized that he was taking it as a personal mission to keep monitoring the state's mystery drones to get answers.\n\nThe FBI has fielded over 5,000 complaints in the course of this drone UFO wave, in progress, but noted that only 100 of these cases now warrant further investigation.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security official has also noted that sightings due to mass concern over the drones has led to many false positives.\n\n'We're confident that many of the reported drone sightings are, in fact, manned aircraft being misidentified as drones,' DHS officials said.\n\nBut the cases above sensitive military bases and US Coast Guard ships off the Jersey shore continue to worry state officials, federal investigators and the US military.\n\nThe FBI and other agencies are investigating the strange activity, but a representative from the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday, Dec. 11: 'We have no more information as to where these drones are coming from, where they're launching from, where they're landing'\n\nOfficials and residents have also seen truly odd, well-lit drones that do not resemble fixed-wing aircraft (example above) deepening the mystery of the craft's origins and intent\n\nPicatinny Arsenal told press that sightings of the unidentified drones, capable of beating their counter-drone defenses, has now climbed to 11 confirmed cases.\n\n'While the source and cause of these aircraft operating in our area remain unknown,' Picatinny's garrison commander, Lt Col Craig A. Bonham II, said, 'we can confirm that they are not the result of any Picatinny Arsenal-related activities.'\n\nAmid the uncertainty, the president-elect called for answers from the US Government as he slammed the Biden administration and urged them to shoot down the UFOs.\n\nBut this was rejected by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas who said that the government does not have the authority to neutralize the drones."

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve has identified five species new to global science: a gecko (Hemidactylus sp.) marked by brown stripes and white nodules, the Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus), plus three plants \u2014 a globe thistle, a mignonette, and a hogbean. In addition, the Reserve recorded three species new to Saudi Arabia and extended the known global range of 34 more. These outcomes, the result of four years of fieldwork by Saudi and international experts, increase the total number of terrestrial species documented in the Reserve to 791. Although the Reserve covers only 1% of the Kingdom's terrestrial area, it is home to more than half of Saudi Arabia's terrestrial species, reinforcing its role as a vital refuge for biodiversity in a changing climate.\n\nNewly discovered gecko Hemidactylus sp, in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve\n\nAndrew Zaloumis, CEO of the Reserve, emphasized the global significance of these findings, stating: \"At a moment in time when the IUCN has warned that 28% of species globally are now at risk of extinction these discoveries are significant. They reaffirm the importance of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve as a bioclimatic refugia, particularly as climate change is increasingly impacting the customary habitats of many of these species. Testament to this is the Reserve's iconic Wadi Al-Disah, with its 200+ species, a key site on the UNESCO World Heritage Bioclimatic Refugia of Western Arabia tentative list. None of this would have been possible without the strong collaboration of natural scientists from the Kingdom and 14 other countries with the Reserve over the last 4 years to conduct multi-season field surveys.\"\n\nAmong the five species new to science are two reptiles and three plants, each with unique ecological and cultural significance. The gecko (Hemidactylus sp.), currently undergoing DNA analysis, features striking brown horizontal stripes from neck to tail and white nodules along its back. This gecko preys on small invertebrates like mosquitoes, playing an essential role in pest control within desert ecosystems. The Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus) is a small, non-venomous species that is bright red with a distinctive black collar.\n\nThe three new plants to science are firstly the globe thistle (Echinops sp. aff. glaberrimus) from the Asteraceae family. It produces vibrant blooms that support pollinators and promote ecosystem health. Historically, it has been used medicinally to treat infections and inflammations. Secondly the mignonette, (Reseda sp. aff. muricata), known for its herbal properties, is often used in teas and perfumery. And thirdly, in contrast, the hogbean (Hyoscyamus sp.) from the Nightshade family has a more complex history, having been used both as a poison and in early anesthesiology and palliative care.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Scientists have announced the discovery of a species of lipstick vine that is completely new to science, found in the depths of the Philippine rainforest.\n\nThis species, which has never been documented in botanical records, has sparked a wave of excitement among scientists and nature enthusiasts alike.\n\nAn expedition into the heart of Luzon\n\nA daring expedition by a team of botanists in 2022 led them into Barangay Balbalasang rainforest, a remote and virtually inaccessible part of Luzon island.\n\nThe journey began with days of rugged travel to reach the rainforest, which was filled with unforgiving thickets that demanded to be sliced with machetes. In these wild conditions, the researchers discovered their prize.\n\nThe team included Jayson Mansibang, Adriane Tobias, and Pastor L. Malabrigo from the University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os, along with Dr. Chris Thorogood, Deputy Director and Head of Science at the Oxford Botanic Garden and Arboretum.\n\nThe researchers stayed with the Banao Tribe, an indigenous community that protects the local forest.\n\nA lipstick vine unlike any other\n\nAmong the species found in the forest, one stood out \u2013 a specimen of the lipstick vine, a genus known as Aeschynanthus.\n\nThis plant had a distinct pattern of delicate purple mottling which painted its flowers in a pattern similar to that of a European foxglove.\n\n\u201cWe were trekking through dense vegetation when suddenly we spotted a luminous white, purple-spotted flower dangling above our heads,\u201d said Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cWe suspected immediately that it was new to science. It\u2019s so exciting that beautiful species like this are still there waiting to be described.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of a new lipstick vine\n\nThe team named the plant Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus from the Latin \u2018penta,\u2019 meaning five, and \u2018trichomatus\u2019 referring to the trichomes \u2013 hair-like outgrowths deep in the throats of the flowers.\n\nLipstick vines, encompassing nearly 180 tropical and subtropical species, are known for their tubular, bud-like appearance.\n\nThese vines, often adorning other plants and trees, boast vibrantly colored flowers that attract birds for pollination.\n\nConservation concerns amid climate change\n\nSadly, this newfound beauty already faces a critical risk of extinction. Rapid climate change, driving increasingly intense typhoons, relentlessly threatens the plant\u2019s natural habitat.\n\nThe Barangay Balbalasang rainforest remains remarkably intact, housing numerous species that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The researchers hope that the new discovery can help support conservation efforts to protect the region.\n\n\u201cWe dedicate this discovery not only to the unique beauty of the Banao forest but also to the Banao People themselves, who, through their care and stewardship, have ensured the conservation of rare species within these precious forests,\u201d said Tobias.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to find Aeschynanthus in such an environment, and as young botanists, we were thrilled to discover something so distinct.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s plant data darkspots\n\n\u201cMany new species remain undocumented in the world\u2019s \u2018plant data darkspots\u2019 \u2013 up to 15% of the world\u2019s flora in fact,\u201d noted Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cFinding these \u2018known unknowns\u2019 is essential for understanding and protecting biodiversity. That\u2019s what makes discoveries such as this one so important for conservation science.\u201d\n\nEcological importance of lipstick vines\n\nThe discovery of Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus sheds light on the ecological importance of lipstick vines in tropical ecosystems.\n\nAs epiphytes, these plants grow on trees without harming them, creating microhabitats that support diverse wildlife.\n\nTheir vividly colored flowers play a vital role in attracting pollinators, particularly birds, which are essential for maintaining the delicate balance of tropical rainforests.\n\nBeyond their ecological contributions, lipstick vines are indicators of environmental health. Their presence often signifies a well-preserved ecosystem, as these plants thrive only in stable and intact habitats.\n\nProtecting a unique rainforest\n\nThe discovery of this new species in Barangay Balbalasang emphasizes the rainforest\u2019s unique biodiversity and the urgent need to safeguard it.\n\nWith nearly 180 known species of Aeschynanthus, each adapted to its specific environment, the newly discovered species offers valuable insights into the evolution of plant-pollinator relationships and the resilience of tropical flora in the face of climate change.\n\nProtecting Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus is not just about preserving a single species; it is about safeguarding the intricate web of life that it supports.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Nordic Journal of Botany.\n\nImage Credit: Chris Thorogood\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

However, people can\u2019t hibernate for a few reasons: Our bodies can\u2019t store enough fat without harming ourselves, function at such low energy and brain activity levels, or survive a massive drop in body temperature.

            "article_content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nAfter months of waiting, it finally happened \u2014 OpenAI launched its video generator, Sora. Or, at least, it opened up access to the tool, only for the entire internet to jump on board simultaneously, forcing OpenAI to pump the brakes on account creation. Thanks to a little bit of patience and determination, I\u2019ve made my way through the waitlist, and now I have the power to generate just about anything I can think up \u2014 within some well-defined limits.\n\nWith that great power and responsibility has come something else, though: a great learning curve. Even though I\u2019m enjoying Sora and am impressed by its capabilities, I\u2019m having trouble nailing down the perfect prompts to get videos I\u2019m pleased with. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a matter of practice, but here\u2019s how my first few days with Sora have gone.\n\nHave you used OpenAI's Sora to generate videos yet? 34 votes Yes 35 % No 65 %\n\nVideo creation at your fingertips?\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about how Sora works \u2014 or at least how to access the powerful video generation tool. Although it comes from OpenAI, and you need to be a ChatGPT Plus or Pro member to start creating, you can\u2019t get to Sora through the main ChatGPT interface. Instead, you have to head directly to the Sora website (sora.com), where you\u2019re met with a gallery of Featured clips that set the bar incredibly high.\n\nAt least, they set the bar high in my own head. I scrolled through a few of them, looked at their prompts, watched them run smoothly, and figured I could do the same. After all, my prompts would be run through the same adaptation of DALL-E 3 that theirs had been, so they should look just as good, right? It\u2019s not quite that easy. Sure, typing in prompts is quite easy, but figuring out what Sora responds best to is a bit harder.\n\nCreating videos is as easy as typing out what you want to see... or at least it seems that way on paper.\n\nBefore we get to the challenges, though, I should probably clarify some of Sora\u2019s current limitations. Unlike Google\u2019s Pixel Studio or another basic image generator, you can\u2019t simply sit and run Sora to your heart\u2019s content \u2014 at least not as a ChatGPT Plus member for $20 per month.\n\nInstead, you\u2019re given a bank of 1,000 credits, which you can spend on video generation as you see fit. Everything you change within your prompt, from the aspect ratio to the duration to the resolution, will cost a certain number of those credits until you run out for the month. Brand new videos cost anywhere from 20 credits to 2,000 credits, and you can check out a helpful table of costs here \u2014 something I wish I\u2019d found before I spent 260 credits in about 20 minutes. You\u2019re also limited to one video generation at a time and a maximum resolution of 720p as a Plus member.\n\nIf you spring for a ChatGPT Pro membership, the limits are much looser but the price is much, much higher at $200 per month. Instead of 1,000 credits, you get 10,000 credits for priority videos, after which you get unlimited video generations; they just take a bit longer \u2014 OpenAI calls them \u201crelaxed videos.\u201d Pro members can also generate five videos at a time, bump them up to 1080p, and let them run as long as 20 seconds.\n\nUnfortunately, though, no matter what tier of ChatGPT you pay for, none of Sora\u2019s videos have audio to them, so you\u2019ll have to download your clips and sync music or sound effects after you\u2019ve nailed down the visuals. OpenAI has suggested that support for audio will reach Sora eventually, it\u2019s just not there yet.\n\nHow hard could it be?\n\nWith that basic introduction out of the way, the rest of using Sora to generate videos should be easy, right? Well, yes and no. Although typing in your prompt, choosing your settings from the menu at the bottom, and waiting for your video to generate is that easy, it\u2019s much harder to come up with something worthy of Sora\u2019s ever-changing Featured feed.\n\nIn an attempt to share my limited cache of tokens for the month, as soon as I got access to Sora, I reached out to my colleague Mitja. He and I had been discussing how quickly we might get access to the platform, so I figured he might have some good ideas for generations right off the bat. As it turned out, his first thought was something I never could have imagined: Ten zebras in suits dancing to a Michael Jackson song in front of the Sydney Opera House while eating pesto ravioli. It may seem like a weird video to make, but if Sora can handle that amount of detail, then it\u2019s definitely the real deal.\n\nSora will take a stab at almost anything you ask for, but you have to describe it just right.\n\nOnce I finished laughing at the idea, I ran it through Sora and waited for the result. Technically, the final product got most things right. It put a group of zebras in suits in front of the Sydney Opera House, and they all had green plates in their hands. However, the number fluctuated between eight and about 12 zebras, there was no indication that it was a Michael Jackson song, and the pesto ravioli was definitely just a green plate \u2014 close, but not quite right. More worryingly, I had bumped the cost of the video up to 100 tokens because I hoped a ten-second clip would show more dancing. It had not.\n\nI\u2019ve since learned, however, that Sora\u2019s Storyboard tool is a must-have for pretty much anything involving complex motion. It allows you to drag and drop clips along your five- or ten-second timeline, helping Sora break up the action and flow from one direction to another. So, in an attempt to draw a little bit more action out of my zebra friends, I jumped into the storyboard and split the dancing and the pesto ravioli into two separate actions spaced out over the five-second clip, then I used ChatGPT to punch up my description \u2014 yet another built-in feature of the Storyboard.\n\nOnce again\u2026 It kind of worked, but it kind of didn\u2019t. Yes, I got the zebras, and they were in front of the Sydney Opera House, but they had given up on dancing, and when asked to eat some of their ravioli, they suddenly grew human hands to hold their forks. Sorry, Featured feed, but I think I\u2019m a long way off.\n\nI\u2019ve also tried more natural prompts, like macaroni penguins sliding down icebergs into the sea, and more fantastical prompts, like a piece of toast with a Pixar-like face leaping out of a toaster, and the story has mostly been the same. Sora handles some pieces of each prompt incredibly well, but you have to describe your scene with just the right amount of detail. Too much, and Sora begins to merge different elements. Too little, and you get a relatively boring finished product.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, there\u2019s even more to Sora than I\u2019ve touched, especially when it comes to editing. The video generator also packs the ability to re-cut, remix, and blend clips to expand on an idea, join one video to another, or clip out elements that don\u2019t work well. But again, I\u2019d still like to nail down a video that looks good the first time.\n\nChallenges aside, I\u2019m excited for the future\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nOverall, it\u2019s fair to call my first few days using Sora a mixed bag. Has the video generator been perfect? No, but I can\u2019t entirely blame OpenAI for that. This is my first shot at generating videos based purely on text, so I\u2019m not surprised that I\u2019ve struggled to nail down the right level of detail. So far, I\u2019ve given Sora too much information, and I\u2019ve given it too little, which means that nailing just the right prompt has to be around the corner.\n\nMore importantly, though, I\u2019ve been thoroughly impressed by what Sora promises to do. The videos I can create as a ChatGPT Plus member take mere moments to conjure, and I imagine they\u2019ll get faster as the model continues its training. I\u2019m not entirely sure that I\u2019d use any of the speedy clips that Sora has cooked up just yet \u2014 many of them still suffer from weird artifacts like the human arms appearing on my zebras \u2014 but the clips that do make it to Sora\u2019s Featured collection give me hope that it\u2019s just a matter of learning how to ask for the right elements.\n\nI'm impressed by Sora, but I have a lot of learning to do.\n\nAlong with that, I won\u2019t be surprised if the way OpenAI handles prompts and creations opens up, too. Right now, when you burn through your 1,000 credits as a ChatGPT Plus member, that\u2019s it \u2014 there\u2019s no way to buy a few more until your billing period rolls over. Likewise, there\u2019s no way to roll unused credits from one month to the next, so you have to find the right balance of spending and saving to make it through the month.\n\nIf it were up to me, I\u2019d sure like to reclaim a few of the sillier credits I\u2019ve spent, but that\u2019s not an option. Instead, I\u2019ll call it the cost of learning, and I\u2019ll just have to take a little bit more time to fine-tune my prompts before I send them off to Sora. Maybe one day, I\u2019ll come up with something worth featuring.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

            "article_content": "NurPhoto/Contributor/Getty Images\n\nWith the holiday season upon us, many companies are finding ways to take advantage through deals, promotions, or other campaigns. OpenAI has found a way to participate with its \"12 days of OpenAI\" event series.\n\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI announced via an X post that starting on Dec. 5, the company would host 12 days of live streams and release \"a bunch of new things, big and small,\" according to the post.\n\nAlso: I'm a ChatGPT power user - here's why Canvas is its best productivity feature\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the campaign, as well as a round-up of every day's drops.\n\nWhat are the '12 days of OpenAI'?\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared a bit more details about the event, which kicked off at 10 a.m. PT on Dec. 5 and will occur daily for 12 weekdays with a live stream featuring a launch or demo. The launches will be both \"big ones\" or \"stocking stuffers,\" according to Altman.\n\nWhat has been dropped so far?\n\nMonday, December 16\n\nThe drops for the second Monday in the 12 days of OpenAI series all focused on Search in ChatGPT.\n\nThe AI search engine is available to all users starting today, including all free users who are signed in anywhere they can access ChatGPT. The feature was previously only available to ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nThe search experience, which allows users to browse the web from ChatGPT, got faster and better on mobile and now has an enriched map experience. The upgrades include image-rich visual results.\n\nSearch is integrated into Advance Voice mode, meaning you can now search as you talk to ChatGPT. To activate this feature, just activate Advance Voice the same way you regularly would and ask it your query verbally. It will then answer your query verbally by pulling from the web.\n\nOpenAI also teased developers, saying, \"Tomorrow is for you,\" and calling the upcoming livestream a \"mini Dev Day.\"\n\nFriday, December 13\n\nOne of OpenAI's most highly requested features has been an organizational feature to better keep track of your conversations. On Friday, OpenAI delivered a new feature called \"Projects.\"\n\nProjects is a new way to organize and customize your chats in ChatGPT, meant to be a part of continuing to optimize the core experience of ChatGPT.\n\nWhen creating a Project, you can include a title, a customized folder color, relevant project files, instructions for ChatGPT on how it can best help you with the project, and more in one place.\n\nIn the Project, you can start a chat and add previous chats from the sidebar to your Project. It can also answer questions using your context in a regular chat format. The chats can be saved in the Project, making it easier to pick up your conversations later and know exactly what to look for where.\n\nIt will be rolled out to Plus, Pro, and Teams users starting today. OpenAI says it's coming to free users as soon as possible. Enterprise and Edu users will see it rolled out early next year.\n\nThursday, December 12\n\nWhen the live stream started, OpenAI addressed the elephant in the room -- the fact that the company's live stream went down the day before. OpenAI apologized for the inconvenience and said its team is working on a post-mortem to be posted later.\n\nThen it got straight into the news -- another highly-anticipated announcement:\n\nAdvanced Voice Mode now has screen-sharing and visual capabilities, meaning it can assist with the context of what it is viewing, whether that be from your phone camera or what's on your screen.\n\nThese capabilities build on what Advanced Voice could already do very well -- engaging in casual conversation as a human would. The natural-like conversations can be interrupted, have multi-turns, and understand non-linear trains of thought.\n\nIn the demo, the user gets directions from ChatGPT's Advanced Voice on how to make a cup of coffee. As the demoer goes through the steps, ChatGPT is verbally offering insights and directions.\n\nThere's another bonus for the Christmas season: Users can access a new Santa voice. To activate it, all users have to do is click on the snowflake icon. Santa is rolling out throughout today everywhere that users can access ChatGPT voice mode. The first time you talk to Santa, your usage limits reset, even if you have reached the limit already, so you can have a conversation with him.\n\nVideo and screen sharing are rolling out in the latest mobile apps starting today and throughout next week to all Team users and most Pro and Plus subscribers. Pro and Plus subscribers in Europe will get access \"as soon as we can,\" and Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next year.\n\nWednesday, December 11\n\nApple released iOS 18.2 on Wednesday. The release includes integrations with ChatGPT across Siri, Writing Tools, and Visual Intelligence. As a result, the live stream focused on walking through the integration.\n\nSiri can now recognize when you ask questions outside its scope that could benefit from being answered by ChatGPT instead. In those instances, it will ask if you'd like to process the query using ChatGPT. Before any request is sent to ChatGPT, a message notifying the user and asking for permission will always appear, placing control in the user's hands as much as possible.\n\n\n\nVisual Intelligence refers to a new feature for the iPhone 16 lineup that users can access by tapping the Camera Control button. Once the camera is open, users can point it at something and search the web with Google, or use ChatGPT to learn more about what they are viewing or perform other tasks such as translating or summarizing text.\n\nWriting Tools now features a new \"Compose\" tool, which allows users to create text from scratch by leveraging ChatGPT. With the feature, users can even generate images using DALL-E.\n\nAll of the above features are subject to ChatGPT's daily usage limits, the same way that users would reach limits while using the free version of the model on ChatGPT. Users can choose whether or not to enable the ChatGPT integration in Settings.\n\nRead more about it here: iOS 18.2 rolls out to iPhones: Try these 6 new AI features today\n\nTuesday, December 10\n\nCanvas is coming to all web users, regardless of plan, in GPT-4o, meaning it is no longer just available in beta for ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nCanvas has been built into GPT-4o natively, meaning you can just call on Canvas instead of having to go to the toggle on the model selector.\n\nThe Canvas interface is the same as what users saw in beta in ChatGPT Plus, with a table on the left hand side that shows the Q+A exchange and a right-hand tab that shows your project, displaying all of the edits as they go, as well as shortcuts.\n\nCanvas can also be used with custom GPTs. It is turned on by default when creating a new one, and there is an option to add Canvas to existing GPTs.\n\nCanvas also has the ability to run Python code directly in Canvas, allowing ChatGPT to execute coding tasks such as fixing bugs.\n\nRead more about it here: I'm a ChatGPT power user - and Canvas is still my favorite productivity feature a month later\n\nMonday, December 9\n\nOpenAI teased the third-day announcement as \"something you've been waiting for,\" followed by the much-anticipated drop of its video model -- Sora. Here's what you need to know:\n\nKnown as Sora Turbo, the video model is smarter than the February model that was previewed.\n\nAccess is coming in the US later today; users need only ChatGPT Plus and Pro.\n\nSora can generate video-to-video, text-to-video, and more.\n\nChatGPT Plus users can generate up to 50 videos per month at 480p resolution or fewer videos at 720p. The Pro Plan offers 10x more usage.\n\nThe new model is smarter and cheaper than the previewed February model.\n\nSora features an explore page where users can view each other's creations. Users can click on any video to see how it was created.\n\nA live demo showed the model in use. The demo-ers entered a prompt and picked aspect ratio, duration, and even presets. I found the live demo video results to be realistic and stunning.\n\nOpenAI also unveiled Storyboard, a tool that lets users generate inputs for every frame in a sequence.\n\nFriday, December 6:\n\nOn the second day of \"shipmas,\" OpenAI expanded access to its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research Program:\n\nThe Reinforcement Fine-Tuning program allows developers and machine learning engineers to fine-tune OpenAI models to \"excel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks,\" according to OpenAI.\n\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning refers to a customization technique in which developers can define a model's behavior by inputting tasks and grading the output. The model then uses this feedback as a guide to improve, becoming better at reasoning through similar problems, and enhancing overall accuracy.\n\nOpenAI encourages research institutes, universities, and enterprises to apply to the program, particularly those that perform narrow sets of complex tasks, could benefit from the assistance of AI, and perform tasks that have an objectively correct answer.\n\nSpots are limited; interested applicants can apply by filling out this form.\n\nOpenAI aims to make Reinforcement Fine-Tuning publicly available in early 2025.\n\nThursday, December 5:\n\nOpenAI started with a bang, unveiling two major upgrades to its chatbot: a new tier of ChatGPT subscription, ChatGPT Pro, and the full version of the company's o1 model.\n\nThe full version of o1:\n\nWill be better for all kinds of prompts, beyond math and science\n\nWill make major mistakes about 34% less often than o1-preview, while thinking about 50% faster\n\nRolls out today, replacing o1-preview to all ChatGPT Plus and now Pro users\n\nLets users input images, as seen in the demo, to provide multi-modal reasoning (reasoning on both text and images)\n\nChatGPT Pro:\n\nIs meant for ChatGPT Plus superusers, granting them unlimited access to the best OpenAI has to offer, including unlimited access to OpenAI o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Mode\n\nFeatures o1 pro mode, which uses more computing to reason through the hardest science and math problems\n\nCosts $200 per month\n\nWhere can you access the live stream?\n\nThe live streams are held on the OpenAI website, and posted to its YouTube channel immediately after. To make access easier, OpenAI will also post a link to the live stream on its X account 10 minutes before it starts, which will be at approximately 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET daily."

Here\u2019s how to submit a claim.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nVERIFY often fact-checks settlement notices so our readers know whether they are legitimate or fraudulent.\n\nSome people, including a VERIFY journalist, received emails in December notifying them about a ParkMobile class action settlement due to a data breach. ParkMobile is a mobile parking payment app that is used in many U.S. states.\n\nGoogle Trends data show many people online are wondering if the ParkMobile data breach settlement is legitimate.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nIs the ParkMobile data breach settlement real?\n\nTHE SOURCES\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nYes, the ParkMobile data breach settlement is real.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nParkMobile customers who were notified about the parking app\u2019s 2021 data breach could receive up to $25 as part of a proposed class action settlement.\n\nThe parking payment app company agreed to a $32.8 million settlement following a 2021 lawsuit alleging it failed to protect people\u2019s personal information, court records show. ParkMobile denied any wrongdoing or liability, an official settlement website says.\n\nParkMobile also acknowledged the settlement and linked out to the official website on Dec. 5.\n\nA class action lawsuit was filed in Georgia about two months after ParkMobile confirmed a \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d linked to a third-party software in March 2021. The lawsuit alleges that about 21 million users\u2019 personal information was compromised in the data breach.\n\nAccording to ParkMobile, the leaked information included license plate numbers, email addresses, phone numbers and mailing addresses, as well as encrypted passwords but not the encryption keys required to read them. Users\u2019 credit card numbers were not leaked, the company said.\n\nWho qualifies for the settlement\n\nAnyone who received a notice from ParkMobile about the 2021 data security incident is eligible to submit a claim, according to the official website. People who are eligible also should have received an emailed notice about the class action settlement.\n\nIf you are still unsure about whether you\u2019re eligible for the settlement, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at 1-866-944-4062.\n\nAccording to the official website, $9 million of the proposed settlement has been set aside for cash payments to people affected by the data breach. The amount of money each person can receive is capped at $25, the website says.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t submit claims for cash payments will receive $1 credits from ParkMobile via email.\n\nHow to submit a claim\n\nPeople who are eligible for the settlement must submit a claim by Wednesday, March 5, 2025, the settlement website says.\n\nYou can submit a claim online using the ID and confirmation code on your mailed or emailed notice. If you don\u2019t have the notice ID and confirmation code, you can look up your login by entering your name and email address.\n\nYou can also print out a claim form here and mail it postmarked no later than March 5 to this address: ParkMobile Data Security Incident, Attn: Claim Forms, 1650 Arch Street, Suite 2210, Philadelphia, PA 19103.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when people who are eligible for the settlement could receive their payments."

            "article_content": "The Hubble tension is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology.\n\nIt centers around the Hubble constant\u2014the measurement of how fast our universe is expanding\u2014which comes out as two different numbers when calculated two different ways, even though those numbers should always match.\n\nNow, the James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that this tension is real, rather than a miscalculation or a problem with our equipment. That means there\u2019s something in the underlying physics of our universe that remains a mystery.\n\nThe Hubble tension is one of the most hotly debated discrepancies in all of astronomy. It centers around a number called the Hubble constant, which is functionally the rate at which our universe is expanding. Yup, our infinite universe is expanding. Trippy.\n\nWe\u2019ve known that this expansion is a fact of our cosmos for a while now (we also know that expansion is speeding up, but that\u2019s another story). But we still don\u2019t know exactly how fast this expansion is happening\u2014we don\u2019t know what the Hubble constant is. And it\u2019s not for lack of trying, either.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere\u2019s a few ways you can measure the Hubble Constant, but there are two major ones. The first, which is how the Hubble Telescope itself does it, is to figure out how fast the things around us are moving away from us. This is done by targeting specific, reliable objects in the sky, calculating the distances to them, and combining those distance with measurements of redshift (a phenomenon that happens when an object moves away from our vantage point, stretching out the light its sending our way and making it appear redder). This is called a local measurement, and it results in a Hubble constant of around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc).\n\nThe second way is to look at the Big Bang. Well, not directly\u2014that\u2019s currently impossible. But we can look at the cosmic microwave background, which is the radiation from the Big Bang that permeates every \u2018corner\u2019 of our universe. By studying this ancient radiation, we can get a reading of what the Hubble constant would have been back when the universe began, and then use our knowledge of the laws of physics to functionally fast-forward and find what that Hubble constant should be now. Using this method, we get a predicted Hubble constant of around 68 km/s/Mpc.\n\nAnd that is the Hubble tension\u2014those numbers should be the same, but they\u2019re not. And when expectation doesn\u2019t match observation in astronomy, it means one of two things: there\u2019s something wrong with our measurement techniques, or there\u2019s something wrong with our understanding of physics.\n\nNow, more and more, it\u2019s looking like the latter. A recent paper\u2014led by Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for his discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating and, by extension, his discovery of dark energy\u2014announced that observations from the James Webb Space Telescope further confirm Hubble\u2019s measurements of the local Hubble constant. According to our absolute best space telescope, the Hubble constant is around 73 km/s/Mpc (which is within the margin of error of the original Hubble measurement), not the ~68 km/s/Mpc it should be.\n\nIt might be fair to have a little bit of a \u201cso what?\u201d reaction to this news. After all, when you boil it down, the only thing we\u2019ve discovered is that there is in fact something we still don\u2019t understand about the expansion of the universe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the excitement behind this announcement comes from the fact that this new measurement confirms that the Hubble tension is real. It\u2019s not a quirk of an old telescope\u2014it\u2019s actually a problem. And that means this isn\u2019t some trivial squabble. There\u2019s something we don\u2019t know about the basic physics that underpin our entire cosmos.\n\nScientists are going to keep pushing to understand exactly what we\u2019re missing that is leading to this discrepancy. And if our scientific history is anything to go by, someday, they\u2019ll figure it out. And when they do, we\u2019re going to have entirely new physics on our hands. How exciting.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve has identified five species new to global science: a gecko (Hemidactylus sp.) marked by brown stripes and white nodules, the Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus), plus three plants \u2014 a globe thistle, a mignonette, and a hogbean. In addition, the Reserve recorded three species new to Saudi Arabia and extended the known global range of 34 more. These outcomes, the result of four years of fieldwork by Saudi and international experts, increase the total number of terrestrial species documented in the Reserve to 791. Although the Reserve covers only 1% of the Kingdom's terrestrial area, it is home to more than half of Saudi Arabia's terrestrial species, reinforcing its role as a vital refuge for biodiversity in a changing climate.\n\nNewly discovered gecko Hemidactylus sp, in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve\n\nAndrew Zaloumis, CEO of the Reserve, emphasized the global significance of these findings, stating: \"At a moment in time when the IUCN has warned that 28% of species globally are now at risk of extinction these discoveries are significant. They reaffirm the importance of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve as a bioclimatic refugia, particularly as climate change is increasingly impacting the customary habitats of many of these species. Testament to this is the Reserve's iconic Wadi Al-Disah, with its 200+ species, a key site on the UNESCO World Heritage Bioclimatic Refugia of Western Arabia tentative list. None of this would have been possible without the strong collaboration of natural scientists from the Kingdom and 14 other countries with the Reserve over the last 4 years to conduct multi-season field surveys.\"\n\nAmong the five species new to science are two reptiles and three plants, each with unique ecological and cultural significance. The gecko (Hemidactylus sp.), currently undergoing DNA analysis, features striking brown horizontal stripes from neck to tail and white nodules along its back. This gecko preys on small invertebrates like mosquitoes, playing an essential role in pest control within desert ecosystems. The Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus) is a small, non-venomous species that is bright red with a distinctive black collar.\n\nThe three new plants to science are firstly the globe thistle (Echinops sp. aff. glaberrimus) from the Asteraceae family. It produces vibrant blooms that support pollinators and promote ecosystem health. Historically, it has been used medicinally to treat infections and inflammations. Secondly the mignonette, (Reseda sp. aff. muricata), known for its herbal properties, is often used in teas and perfumery. And thirdly, in contrast, the hogbean (Hyoscyamus sp.) from the Nightshade family has a more complex history, having been used both as a poison and in early anesthesiology and palliative care.\n\nStory Continues"

However, people can\u2019t hibernate for a few reasons: Our bodies can\u2019t store enough fat without harming ourselves, function at such low energy and brain activity levels, or survive a massive drop in body temperature.

The popularity of a P2P system is enhancing business performance with broader organizational goals.\n\nContemporary procure-to-pay systems are essential for businesses to monitor and control environmental objectives, comply with legal requirements, and foster the right sourcing. The procurement team can monitor and analyze their supply chain\u2019s ecological impact, find areas for optimization, and make strategic data-driven decisions.\n\nEssential aspects that promote ethical and environmentally conscious procurement include:\n\nMonitor the ecological footprint of carbon emissions and waste, which are really hazardous for both business and the environment.\n\nIncorporating fair labor practices that are an important part of supplier selection and compliance with ethical standards.\n\nMitigate risk that hinder the sourcing process related to environmental, social and governace (ECG) issues,\n\nEffective Strategies for Embracing New Procurement Trends\n\nThe new procurement trends emerge every year. The goal for procurement leaders isn\u2019t just to embrace the current market reality, but to channel their procurement operations in the right way so they can stay ahead of competitors. This means investing in digital technologies such as analytics, automation, and AI, and enhancing their workforce\u2019s abilities to fully utilize and leverage these digital e-procurement software solutions.\n\nEvaluate Organizational Readiness\n\nTo evaluate organizational readiness, the procurement leader must analyze their current people, processes, and technology and evaluate how well they align with their team\u2019s goals. The complete assessment provider should have a practical understanding of their needs so they can create a clear transformation plan.\n\nExecutive buy-in and alignment:\n\nTo ensure modernization challenges, procurement leaders must get buy-in from their departments, which could be the supply chain organization, accounting, and finance.\n\nOperations:\n\nA good assessment of where procurement operations stand today helps procurement leaders identify areas for further improvement and define practical timeframes for these changes.\n\nConclusion: We have wrapped up procurement trends for 2025 by implementing those aspects in day-to-day operations. Here C1india comes with the right procure to pay software solutions, organizations can reduce errors, accelerate processes, and support sustainability and ethical sourcing, ultimately boosting operational efficiency and achieving strategic goals."

            "article_content": "In today\u2019s rapidly changing technology landscape, machine learning and AI enable us to redefine industries and change how we interact with the world. AI allows developers to create more intelligent, flexible, and efficient applications. Arm, due to its unique position in the industry, has been enabling AI across a variety of platforms for more than a decade.\n\nIn this article, I want to detail how Arm\u2019s technology allows developers to focus on innovation and the unique aspects of the applications they are developing while utilizing Arm\u2019s existing technology.\n\nYou don\u2019t need an NPU for AI applications For over seven years, I\u2019ve been making content about the advantages and disadvantages of different machine learning accelerators \u2014 called NPUs. These processors have their place in devices, but one myth is that you need one to run machine learning or AI tasks. That\u2019s simply not true. AI tasks don\u2019t hinge exclusively on NPUs; they can run on anything from a CPU to a GPU. With the technology found in Arm v8 and Arm v9 chips, you can run accelerated machine learning tasks particularly well on Arm CPUs.\n\nMatrix multiplication is the key mathematical operation at the heart of machine learning and AI. GPUs and NPUs are good at matrix multiplication. However, modern Arm CPUs are also good at this processing task and have hardware accelerators that enable it, too. Whether it\u2019s Arm v8 or Arm v9, Cortex-A or Cortex-X, or Arm\u2019s Neoverse processors, they all have different technologies that allow the acceleration of matrix multiplication operations.\n\nFor example, Arm\u2019s Neon technology, and Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) are both available in Arm processors, there are also 8-bit matrix-by-matrix multiplication instructions in the Arm instruction set. In smartphones and on the edge devices, Scalable Matrix Extensions (SME) are available inside Arm processors. These technologies allow the CPU to perform accelerated matrix operations without a GPU or NPU.\n\nArm\u2019s Kleidi technology\n\nArm\n\nBeyond the hardware systems, Kleidi is a central part of Arm\u2019s strategy for enabling AI on Arm-based mobile and server platforms. It covers a range of resources and partnerships for helping developers accelerate AI seamlessly on Arm, including a library of high-performance machine learning kernels called KleidiAI, which has been optimized for Arm CPUs using those various hardware accelerators.Kleidi is available on GitLab, and these kernels have been integrated into various frameworks that are ready for developers to use. As a result, we now have hardware acceleration for Arm CPUs, supporting various machine learning technologies, from classical machine learning to current generative AI.\n\nArm has integrated Kleidi technology into popular AI frameworks such as PyTorch and ExecuTorch, resulting in significant out-of-the-box performance improvements for developers. This integration ensures that developers can seamlessly leverage Arm\u2019s optimized libraries within their existing workflows, gaining up to a 12x performance improvement with minimal effort.\n\nArm partnered with Meta to ensure the recently launched Llama 3.2 model works perfectly on Arm CPUs. The availability of smaller LLMs that enable fundamental text-based generative AI workloads, such as the one billion and three billion parameter versions, is critical for enabling AI inference at scale. Arm CPUs can run larger models, such as Llama 3.2 with 11 billion parameters and even the 90 billion parameter model in the cloud. These larger models are an excellent fit for CPU-based inference workloads in the cloud that generate text and images.\n\nThe 11 billion parameter version of Llama 3.2, running on an Amazon AWS Graviton4 processor, can achieve 29.3 tokens per second during the generation phase, and that\u2019s just on the CPU. Thanks to the collaboration between Arm and Meta on the ExecuTorch framework, you can now access optimal performance by running those models on the edge. Running the new Llama 3.2 three billion LLM on an Arm-powered smartphone through the Arm CPU optimizations leads to a 5x improvement in prompt processing and a 3x improvement in token generation, achieving 19.92 tokens per second during the generation phase.\n\nIf you want a demonstration of this, check out my video above.\n\nA massive boost for developers\n\nArm\n\nThanks to these advancements, the possibilities for developers are enormous. Think of everything you could do with a large language model running on a phone using an Arm CPU \u2014 no GPU, no NPU, no cloud, just the CPU. Arm\u2019s approach is performance portability, which means that AI developers can optimize once and then deploy their models across various platforms without making any modifications. This is particularly useful for developers who need to deploy models both on the edge, in a smartphone, and in the cloud. By using Arm, developers can be sure that their model will also perform well on other platforms once optimized for one platform.\n\nArm has some great resources for developers, including documentation on how to accelerate generative AI and ML workloads when you choose to run them on Arm CPUs, in addition to running AI and ML on Android devices."

But on Monday, he said he anticipated that would be \u201cmore difficult\u201d to resolve than the current turmoil in the Middle East, which is rooted in the century-old Israeli Palestinian conflict.\n\n\u201cI see that as more difficult,\u201d Trump said, before decrying the Biden administration\u2019s recent decision to loosen restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s use of American-supplied arms in recent weeks, allowing Kyiv to strike deeper inside Russian territory.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump delivers remarks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Dec. 16, 2024. Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that should have been allowed,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly not just weeks before I take over.\n\nTrump then said he might reverse the decision, adding \u201cI thought it was a very stupid thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe president-elect also suggested he might expect Kyiv to hand over land to Russia as part of negotiated peace, signaling a departure from the Biden administration\u2019s longstanding policy that Ukraine should steer any discussion on making territorial concessions in order to end the war.\n\n\u201cAll those cities are destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's nice to say they want their land back, but the cities are largely destroyed.\u201d\n\nTrump said he would speak to Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy before weighing in on how much land Ukraine should cede, but said it was still possible a deal to end the war could be reached before he entered the White House.\n\nHe also spoke about the devastation the war had caused in vivid terms, without expressly blaming Moscow for igniting it.\n\n\u201cIt's a carnage that we haven't seen since the Second World War. It's got to be stopped. And I'm doing I'm doing my best to stop it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Syria's Assad: 'We have to get on with our lives'\n\nThe president-elect was also asked by ABC\u2019s Selina Wang if the Kremlin should have to hand over former Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, who fled rebel fighters by escaping to Russia.\n\n\u201cWell, I hadn't thought of it. I think we have to get on with our lives. I have to see what happens,\u201d Trump responded.\n\nThe president-elect said he was already actively engaged on other matters related to the Middle East, saying he had a \u201cvery good talk\u201d with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend.\n\nTough talk on Israeli hostages in Gaza\n\nTrump also reiterated a demand he made in a post on his Truth Social site earlier this month that all hostages held in Gaza should be released prior to his inauguration, saying otherwise there would be \u201cALL HELL TO PAY.\u201d\n\nAsked about what the consequences Hamas would face if all the detainees were not freed by that point, Trump responded \u201cthey\u2019re going to have to determine what that means.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it means it won\u2019t be pleasant,\u201d he added.\n\nSome progress on Gaza ceasefire\n\nTrump\u2019s statements come as the State Department and some Israeli officials are signaling progress towards a limited deal to exchange some of the hostages held by Hamas for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nAccording to two U.S. officials familiar with the negotiations, Hamas has shown more willingness to compromise in recent days -- indicating it would temporarily tolerate the presence of some Israeli forces in the enclave during a ceasefire. The group has also provided information on some hostages Hamas said it would release as part of an agreement, they added.\n\n\u201cWe are we are pushing as hard as we know how to do at this point, and we believe we can get to a deal,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday. \u201cIt remains incumbent on Hamas and Israel agreeing to those final terms and getting it over the line. And I can't good conscience tell you stand here and tell you that that's going to happen, but it should happen.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is in free fall, with shares tanking 12% in premarket trading on Monday. This comes hot on the heels of Friday's announcement that it's getting booted from the Nasdaq-100 Index, effective December 23. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Axon Enterprise (AXON are stepping in, replacing Super Micro, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). For Super Micro, the move caps a brutal nine months that saw its stock lose nearly 70% of its value since hitting a record $118.8 in March. The company's troubles have snowballed, from missed earnings expectations to a delayed annual report filing, auditor resignations, and a Department of Justice probe triggered by short-seller allegations.\n\nBut the hits keep coming. Bloomberg dropped another bombshell, reporting that Super Micro has hired Evercore to explore capital-raising options, including equity sales, debt financing, or private equity investments. This isn't the company's first trip down the capital-raising laneback in March, it sold 2 million new shares to drum up $2 billion. Now, with governance concerns lingering and a February deadline to file overdue reports to avoid Nasdaq delisting, Super Micro is walking a tightrope. Meanwhile, its pivot to BDO as its new auditor underscores a desperate attempt to restore credibility, but investors are clearly skeptical.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Super Micro is teetering on the edge. The Nasdaq removal is a glaring red flag, and while the potential capital raise could buy some breathing room, the company's underlying issuesgovernance gaps, financial reporting delays, and a shrinking market caparen't going away anytime soon. For investors, this might be a wait-and-watch game, but with every misstep, the odds of a turnaround get slimmer. The question now is whether Super Micro can stabilize or if it's destined to be a cautionary tale for growth stocks gone wrong.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n"

            "article_content": "Investors don't need to just invest in flashy companies that make the headlines to beat the market. Names like Nvidia and Tesla may be exciting to follow, but a quiet, industrial stock like United Rentals (URI -1.79%) can provide market-beating returns, too.\n\nShares of the world's largest equipment rental company have trounced the S&P 500 index in 2024 and should have more room to run heading into 2025. Even after soundly beating the S&P 500 with a 40% total return in 2024, United Rentals looks to have tailwinds heading into 2025.\n\nThe time is now for infrastructure\n\nUnited Rentals is the industry leader with more than 1,600 global branch locations. It concentrates in North America with a diversified customer base including companies in the construction, industrial, energy, and mining sectors. The company also has a highly profitable specialty solutions segment that has been growing at a 24% annual rate over the past decade. That represents about one-third of annual revenue.\n\nShares have soared this year as United Rentals' business continues to grow. Sales from equipment rentals, which make up 85% of total revenue, increased 7.4% in the first nine months of 2024 versus last year. Diluted earnings per share jumped nearly 12%, though. The company has rewarded shareholders by paying out 10% more in dividends, too.\n\nUnited Rentals CEO Matthew Flannery believes the company is well situated looking forward as well. In the company's third-quarter earnings release, he stated, \"Longer-term, we remain optimistic on the multiple secular tailwinds we see, particularly across large projects.\"\n\nOne of those tailwinds is ongoing infrastructure spending authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed in 2021. That law provides $550 billion through 2026 for investments in roads, bridges, water infrastructure, and other U.S. infrastructure. And it's not just federal money that will boost projects in which United Rentals will participate. Considering all that, it's not hard to see why the stock has soared this year.\n\nNo playing politics\n\nThe infrastructure law is certainly a positive catalyst for United Rentals' business, though. And while investors in all sectors are trying to predict what changes the incoming administration might seek, clawing back funds dedicated to infrastructure investments isn't likely to be one of them, in my opinion.\n\nSome may not recall, but President-elect Trump himself placed infrastructure at the top of his platform when he was first elected in 2016. So it seems likely that work to update transportation routes and modernize ports, airports, and other public structures will continue.\n\nThe consensus is that the overall economy will also keep growing in 2025, which will continue to encourage private investment. This year, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a rate of 3% in the second quarter and 2.8% in the third quarter. The intergovernmental Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) projects 2.8% GDP growth in the U.S. in 2025. While consensus estimates among economists call for a slower rate, Goldman Sachs thinks the economy will grow at a 2.5% pace. Any growth in that range will be beneficial.\n\nUnited Rentals is North America's market share leader in its space and has end-market exposure beyond just infrastructure. GDP growth will spur continued investments by businesses that will help United Rentals continue on its growth path. Projects in semiconductor manufacturing, data centers, electric vehicle and battery plants, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) and renewable energy investments will all contribute.\n\nMore room to run\n\nInvestors should also be attracted to the company's strong cash flow. It generated nearly $10 billion in free cash flow over the last five years. It allocates capital by investing in organic growth and looking for strategic opportunities providing appropriate returns. It also pays a dividend as noted previously and has reduced its share count by more than 40% with share repurchases since 2012.\n\nWhile the 2024 gains have the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at slightly over 20, that's still well below its last cyclical peak of 27.4. Considering the underlying growth prospects for United Rentals, that's a reasonable valuation that leaves room for the stock to keep running in 2025."

            "article_content": "Nvidia\u2019s next-gen series of GPUs is an open secret, and just a month out from CES 2025, the names and specs for these potentially massive graphics cards are out in the open. In the latest leak, a graphics OEM spoiled the names of the top five Nvidia cards, including the monstrous RTX 5090. The top-end card in the codenamed Blackwell series could take up a ton of space inside your PC. At the same time, it demands enough juice to make your next itemized electrical bill as big as the card itself.\n\nCard manufacturer Zotac leaked the SKUs for Nvidia\u2019s next slate of cards. VideoCardz picked up on the Google Search listings CSI tools before Zotac could pull the results. The screenshotted listings mention the 5090 with 32GB of GDDR7 memory at the top end, which confirms an 8GB increase from the RTX 4090\u2019s 24 GB.\n\nThese cards are big suckers. The RTX 5090 will supposedly take up three to four slots on your motherboard. The current RTX 4090 takes up three slots on most boards. That doesn\u2019t account for length, however. Nvidia\u2019s cards are also a massive power hog. The card manufacturer recommends having a PSU between 650W and 750W. Past rumors hinted the card itself could have a 600W TGP. Rumormonger Kotike7kimi, who normally has a good track record for GPU leaks, wrote on Twitter that the card may demand slightly less than the total 600W. Either way, the 5080 is somewhat more manageable, supposedly demanding 400W. The current RTX 4090 has a 450W total graphics power.\n\nThe Zotac leak showed five cards, including the GeForce RTX 5090, the RTX 5090D (a model made for Chinese markets), the RTX 5080, the RTX 5070 Ti, and the RTX 5070. If you\u2019re wondering where the 5060 or 5050 are, it\u2019s safe to assume they may not arrive at the same time as these higher-end cards. It\u2019s another matter whether Nvidia announces them at CES 2025 but later releases them.\n\nBeyond the need for a separate baby carriage inside your PC case to keep it cradled without toppling your tower, the confirmed VRAM gives more credence to past rumors that the 5090 will have 21,760 FP32 CUDA cores, more than double the number of the RTX 4090.\n\nWe\u2019d also like to hear from Nvidia itself why it decided to release the 5070 Ti \u201cTitanium\u201d edition simultaneously with its other cards. Nvidia normally drops these versions later as a sidegrade to existing GPUs, as with the 4070 Ti. Nvidia seems to be focusing on the high-end GPUs, while leaving the lower-end cards for later.\n\nFor the budget builders, it doesn\u2019t leave much room to hope the lower-end 50-series will be inexpensive. There\u2019s been much less to go on with the 5060 or supposed 5060 Ti. There have been even fewer hints about any kind of RTX 5050. Intel just released its budget cards like the B580, with claims it can top the RTX 4060 in most games, plus it comes with 12GB of VRAM. So far, rumors hint the non-Ti 5060 may have 8GB."

A unique discovery that not only teaches us more about our past, but also shows how unique the story of Roman Heerlen is for the Netherlands,\" Clemens wrote.\n\nAdvert\n\nAfter analysing the gravesite, researchers deduced that Heerlen's first settlement would have been around the Augustan era from around 0 to 20 AD.\n\nThis gravesite was discovered in the midst of excavations at Raadhuisplein, the town square in Heerlen, near a couple of historical roads in Via Belgica and Via Traiana.\n\nIt was found to be an important location in the middle of a Roman settlement named Coriovallum, according to archaeologists.\n\nCariovallum was known for its Roman bathhouse, which is also the oldest stone building in the whole country, built in approximately 40AD.\n\nAdvert\n\nNot only that, but the building also had a restaurant and library, which points towards the area being a multi-purpose building and a place of meeting in Roman times. They really were ahead of their time, weren't they?\n\nA bronze skin scraper, four plates and a bowl were found in the grave with Flaccus (Municipality of Heerlen)\n\nArchaeologists further explained that their findings would give us some new insights into the history of the city, adding: \u201cNever before have we found a Roman grave from this period with a name.\u201d\n\nAs well as Flaccus, they found a bronze skin scraper, four plates and a bowl in the grave, managing to trace the pottery back to ancient Italy, confirming their suspicions that he was a Roman soldier.\n\nAdvert\n\nIn the past, digs in the area have uncovered nothing more than pottery shreds, not proving the presence of a settlement as these items could have been left behind during travel.\n\nFlaccus' grave gave researchers eye-opening evidence that there was a Roman presence in the region, as they further explained: \u201cIt is a unique find because it is not only the oldest Roman grave in Heerlen but also because no name was known there before.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Although we are all well aware of who Jeff Bezos is, and that he's worth a few quid, not a lot of us are clued up on his family life.\n\nHis surname might have become synonymous with astronomical wealth, but it turns out that he only acquired it when he was four years old.\n\nAnd that's why his biological father, Ted Jorgensen, had no idea that his son had become one of the richest blokes in the world until 2012.\n\nAdvert\n\nTake a look at this:\n\nJorgensen was 69 years old when he opened up about discovering that he was the father of Bezos two years earlier, who at that time was in his late 40s.\n\nThe e-commerce kingpin was born in January 1964 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, while his mother Jacklyn Gise was still in high school and his dad was working as a circus performer.\n\nAdvert\n\nBut the pair divorced the following year, when the Amazon founder - then named Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen - was just 17 months old.\n\nGise went on to marry Miguel 'Mike' Bezos in April 1968, while asking Jorgensen to let her new husband adopt their son and give up custody.\n\nHe agreed, and the little boy who would later become a business magnate had his surname legally changed to Bezos.\n\nSpeaking to Inside Edition in 2014, Jorgensen recalled the last time he had ever seen his son before they completely lost contact.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"I was working in a Walmart and I remember them coming to visit me for some reason,\" he said.\n\n\"It was cold and he had his little winter coat on, and I just remember him walking down the aisle coming to see me.\"\n\nJeff Bezos pictured with Jacklyn and Miguel in 2016 (MOLLY RILEY/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFast forward to 2012, Jorgensen was left stunned when journalist Brad Stone waltzed into his bike shop in Arizona, US, to ask him a few questions.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe informed the shop owner that he had made the connection between him and Bezos while conducting research for a book detailing Amazon's rise to power.\n\nThis came as quite the shock to the former unicyclist, as he had never even heard of the world's largest online retailer and didn't use a computer.\n\nHe told Stone at the time: \"I didn't know where he [Bezos] was, if he had a good job or not, or if he was alive or dead.\"\n\nJorgensen said that over the years, he had forgotten the new surname his son had taken, hence why he had no idea about Bezos' meteoric journey to success.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe opened up about regretting not having a relationship with his son during the 2014 interview, saying he regarded it as a 'big mistake'.\n\n\"But at the time, I thought it was the best,\" Jorgensen said.\n\nReflecting on his conversation with Stone, he said: \"He asked me if I knew who Jeff Bezos was. I said, 'No, the name kind of sounds familiar, but I don't know him'.\"\n\nTed Jorgensen passed away in 2015 (YouTube/Inside Edition)\n\nJorgensen - who was battling emphysema at the time - spoke of his desire to apologise to his son for what he regarded as the biggest mistake of his life, although getting in touch with a bloke as high-profile as Bezos proved difficult.\n\n\"I would just like to tell him I used to change his diapers and just shake his hand and tell him he's really done a good job with his life,\" he said.\n\nThe bike shop owner, who was based in Phoenix, passed away in March 2015, aged 70.\n\nAccording to Page Six, he never reconnected with Bezos before he died.\n\nWhen asked about Jorgensen in 1999, the billionaire told Wired: \"The reality, as far as I'm concerned, is that my dad [Miguel Bezos] is my natural father.\n\n\"The only time I ever think about it, genuinely, is when a doctor asks me to fill out a form.\"\n\nHe previously praised his adoptive dad for moving to the US from Cuba as a teenager, saying: \"His grit, determination, and optimism are inspiring.\"\n\nBezos - who created Amazon out of his garage in Seattle in 1994 - stepped down as CEO of the company in July 2021.\n\nAccording to Forbes, his current net worth is a whopping $241.2billion."

            "article_content": "For the last month, New Jerseyans have reported odd lights in the sky at night, a rash of reported drone sightings that has attracted the attention of local residents, politicians and even President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nConcerned witnesses have described clusters of lights, saying they look like drones hovering over populated areas around the state. Now, even as sightings have expanded to New York and Maryland, government officials haven\u2019t been able to put people\u2019s minds at ease.\n\nSo who (or what) is behind the mysterious drone sightings? And can you shoot them down in California?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'This has gone too far': Drones temporarily closed runways at NY airport, governor says\n\nBecause the sightings aren't confirmed to be connected, it's possible different sightings have different explanations.\n\nFederal authorities have tried to reassure residents that the objects don\u2019t appear to be operating nefariously. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have said such sightings mostly appear to be not drones at all.\n\n\u201cHistorically, we have experienced cases of mistaken identity, where reported drones are, in fact, manned aircraft or facilities,\u201d the agencies said in a joint statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey lawmakers say they believe there is more to the story than federal officials have shared publicly.\n\nCan you shoot down drones in California? What to know after mystery NJ sightings\n\nAnd President-elect Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to demand government give answers, writing: \"Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\" On Nov. 22, the FAA issued a temporary flight restriction prohibiting drones over Trump's National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey.\n\nOn Thursday Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., criticized the Biden administration for being \"dismissive\" about the reported sightings arguing the White House team has failed his \"obligation to the American people to figure out and tell us what is going on immediately.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lack of clear answers has fueled rampant speculation and sometimes bizarre or joking theories.\n\n\u201cThe drones in New Jersey can easily be explained. Teams are clearly spying on the Jets and Giants practices which is why they have struggled this season,\u201d former NFL kicker Lawrence Tynes said in a post on X.\n\n\u201cFirst, a Chinese spy balloon drifted across U.S. airspace for a week. Now, unidentified drones are flying over New Jersey, avoiding radar detection. Gaps in our airspace are being exploited, and because of it, the safety of Americans is at risk,\u201d New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew posted.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some possible explanations for the sightings \u2013 and the evidence for or against the theories.\n\nFor the last month, New Jerseyans have reported odd lights in the sky at night, a rash of reported drone sightings that has attracted the attention of local residents. These photos were taken on Dec. 8 in Toms River, N.J.\n\nIs it really drones?\n\nGovernment officials have said it\u2019s likely there\u2019s aren\u2019t actually drones in many of the sightings. White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said many of the sightings are actually of piloted aircraft flying legally.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry Direen, an electronic and software engineering expert at DireenTech, said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if people were seeing drones at first, but that once the notion of drones took hold, people assumed any aircraft they couldn\u2019t identify was a drone.\n\n\u201cAfter what were likely valid sightings of possibly hobbyist drones, every aircraft can then become suspicious,\u201d he said.\n\nHoaxes, UFOs, witches, drones: NJ is no stranger to strange happenings\n\nKirby said during a news conference that authorities haven\u2019t been able to corroborate \u201cany of the reported visual sightings\u201d \u2014 despite using \u201cvery sophisticated electronic detection technologies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe FBI, DHS and our federal partners, in close coordination with the New Jersey State Police, continue to deploy personnel and technology to investigate this situation and confirm whether the reported drone flights are actually drones or are instead manned aircraft or otherwise inaccurate sightings,\u201d the agencies said in the statement.\n\nForeign government surveillance?\n\nU.S. government officials this week assured the public that the spotted aircraft do not appear to be sent by a foreign government, quashing a theory posed by Van Drew, who said the drones could be controlled by Iran.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence the drones pose a national security threat, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday. The sightings may actually be piloted aircraft operating legally, the agencies said. Also worth noting: the craft haven\u2019t flown in restricted airspace, they said.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, they have uncovered no such malicious activity or intent at this stage,\u201d a joint statement from the agencies said. \u201cWhile there is no known malicious activity occurring in New Jersey, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight the insufficiency of current authorities.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNew Jersey lawmakers told the Asbury Park Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, said they were briefed by State Police and told authorities don\u2019t know where the drones are coming from, and are unable to detect them.\n\n\u201cListen, I hope it\u2019s no big deal, but the federal government needs to be more truthful.\u201d New Jersey Assemblyman Greg Myhre said.\n\nUS government drones?\n\nGovernment officials including the Pentagon said the drones spotted by residents for the last few weeks are not operated by the U.S. government or military.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely that a government organization would be flying the drones over public locations, Direen said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cClearly they are not being very stealthy if they are,\u201d he said.\n\nKids playing a prank, or hobbyists?\n\nCould the drones people keep seeing be someone playing a prank, or drone hobbyists just out having a good time? It\u2019s not illegal to fly drones in New Jersey, but you have to meet certain requirements depending on the size of the drone and the reason you\u2019re flying it, according to federal and state laws.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it should be pretty easy for officials to figure out, Direen said.\n\n\u201cIf the drones are being flown legally, the ADS-B transponder on the drone should make it easy for authorities to identify the drone and the operator,\u201d he said.\n\nUFOs?\n\nCould the drones be the work of aliens? At this point, officials have given no evidence to suggest that, but also no evidence to debunk it. (And many UFO sightings are believed to have natural explanations.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI suppose some alien kids could be flying their toy drones while their parents are busy out abducting humans and performing experiments on them,\u201d Direen said.\n\nIs it legal to shoot down a drone in California?\n\nNo. It is illegal to try to shoot down or destroy a drone that trespasses on private property or above public spaces because it may cause safety risks.\n\nAs of Oct. 1, 791,597 drones are registered in the U.S., according to the Federal Aviation Administration, including 396,746 commercial drones and 387,746 recreational drones.\n\nRegardless of the drone's classification, however, the FAA considers them aircraft \u2014 meaning that you could be charged with shooting at an aircraft, a federal crime if you take a shot at one.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf you believe a drone is violating the law, your best bet is to contact law enforcement.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information, correct a misspelling/typo and to change or add a photo or video.)\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Mass drone sightings prompt worries, but there may be an explanation"

            "article_content": "The Hubble tension is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology.\n\nIt centers around the Hubble constant\u2014the measurement of how fast our universe is expanding\u2014which comes out as two different numbers when calculated two different ways, even though those numbers should always match.\n\nNow, the James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that this tension is real, rather than a miscalculation or a problem with our equipment. That means there\u2019s something in the underlying physics of our universe that remains a mystery.\n\nThe Hubble tension is one of the most hotly debated discrepancies in all of astronomy. It centers around a number called the Hubble constant, which is functionally the rate at which our universe is expanding. Yup, our infinite universe is expanding. Trippy.\n\nWe\u2019ve known that this expansion is a fact of our cosmos for a while now (we also know that expansion is speeding up, but that\u2019s another story). But we still don\u2019t know exactly how fast this expansion is happening\u2014we don\u2019t know what the Hubble constant is. And it\u2019s not for lack of trying, either.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere\u2019s a few ways you can measure the Hubble Constant, but there are two major ones. The first, which is how the Hubble Telescope itself does it, is to figure out how fast the things around us are moving away from us. This is done by targeting specific, reliable objects in the sky, calculating the distances to them, and combining those distance with measurements of redshift (a phenomenon that happens when an object moves away from our vantage point, stretching out the light its sending our way and making it appear redder). This is called a local measurement, and it results in a Hubble constant of around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc).\n\nThe second way is to look at the Big Bang. Well, not directly\u2014that\u2019s currently impossible. But we can look at the cosmic microwave background, which is the radiation from the Big Bang that permeates every \u2018corner\u2019 of our universe. By studying this ancient radiation, we can get a reading of what the Hubble constant would have been back when the universe began, and then use our knowledge of the laws of physics to functionally fast-forward and find what that Hubble constant should be now. Using this method, we get a predicted Hubble constant of around 68 km/s/Mpc.\n\nAnd that is the Hubble tension\u2014those numbers should be the same, but they\u2019re not. And when expectation doesn\u2019t match observation in astronomy, it means one of two things: there\u2019s something wrong with our measurement techniques, or there\u2019s something wrong with our understanding of physics.\n\nNow, more and more, it\u2019s looking like the latter. A recent paper\u2014led by Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for his discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating and, by extension, his discovery of dark energy\u2014announced that observations from the James Webb Space Telescope further confirm Hubble\u2019s measurements of the local Hubble constant. According to our absolute best space telescope, the Hubble constant is around 73 km/s/Mpc (which is within the margin of error of the original Hubble measurement), not the ~68 km/s/Mpc it should be.\n\nIt might be fair to have a little bit of a \u201cso what?\u201d reaction to this news. After all, when you boil it down, the only thing we\u2019ve discovered is that there is in fact something we still don\u2019t understand about the expansion of the universe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the excitement behind this announcement comes from the fact that this new measurement confirms that the Hubble tension is real. It\u2019s not a quirk of an old telescope\u2014it\u2019s actually a problem. And that means this isn\u2019t some trivial squabble. There\u2019s something we don\u2019t know about the basic physics that underpin our entire cosmos.\n\nScientists are going to keep pushing to understand exactly what we\u2019re missing that is leading to this discrepancy. And if our scientific history is anything to go by, someday, they\u2019ll figure it out. And when they do, we\u2019re going to have entirely new physics on our hands. How exciting.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

(Courtesy: Magnus Johansson/LiU)\n\nThe orbital angular momentum states of light have been used to relate quantum uncertainty to wave\u2013particle duality. The experiment was done by physicists in Europe and confirms a 2014 theoretical prediction that a minimum level of uncertainty must always result when a measurement is made on a quantum object \u2013 regardless of whether the object is observed as a wave, as a particle, or anywhere in between.\n\nIn the famous double-slit thought experiment, quantum particles such as electrons are fired on-by-one at two adjacent slits in a barrier. As time progresses, an interference pattern will build up on a detector behind the barrier. This is an example of wave\u2013particle duality in quantum mechanics, whereby each particle travels through both slits as a wave that interferes with itself. However, if the trajectories of the particles are observed such that it is known which slit each particle travelled through, no interference pattern is seen. Since the 1970s, several different versions of the experiment have been done in the laboratory \u2013 confirming the quantum nature of reality.\n\nRichard Feynman once described this as \u201ca phenomenon which is impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the only mystery [of quantum mechanics].\u201d This phenomenon is known as measurement uncertainty.\n\nPartial particles\n\nIn 1979, William Wootters and his colleague Wojciech Zurek at the University of Texas at Austin showed that wave\u2013particle duality is not a one-or-the-other phenomenon. Instead it is possible to observe partial particle and partial wave-like behaviour, with a trade-off between the two.\n\nThis echoes another baffling element of quantum mechanics, namely preparation uncertainty. This is typified by Werner Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle. This states that one cannot know the position and momentum of a quantum object beyond a certain degree of accuracy, and the more one knows about one, the more uncertain the other becomes.\n\nDespite Feynman\u2019s contention that quantum mechanics contains only one real mystery, however, there is no obvious theoretical connection between measurement uncertainty and preparation uncertainty. In 2014, however, Patrick Coles and colleagues at the National University of Singapore showed theoretically that the two were equivalent. This has never been experimentally demonstrated, however.\n\nConjugate variables\n\nIn the new work, Guilherme Xavier at colleagues at Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden set out to test the relationship between the visibility and the distinguishability of opposite states \u2013 which according to Coles\u2019 predictions should be conjugate variables analogous to position and momentum. They sent highly attenuated, mostly single-photon laser pulses in two possible orthogonal orbital angular momentum states down an optical fibre to an input beamsplitter. Photons with opposite angular momenta emerged through different output fibres.\n\nThe researchers then used a phase modulator to add a variable phase delay to photons travelling down one of the paths. They then directed the paths to meet again at a second, tunable beamsplitter.\n\nBy placing a second modulator before the tunable beamsplitter and thereby adjusting the phase with which the two paths met, it was possible to tune the extent to which the paths recombined. This allowed them to control the extent to which the second beamsplitter actually behaved as a beamsplitter.\n\n\u201cWhen the beamsplitter is fully inserted you get interference back \u2013 this corresponds to a value in the modulator of \u03c0/2,\u201d explains Xavier, \u201cWhen you have zero in the modulator the upper path will always go to one detector and the lower path will always go to the other.\u201d\n\nFixed lower bound\n\nThis latter case corresponds to a particle picture, but it provides no information about which path a particular particle has taken through the detector. The only way one can obtain that information is to prevent one of the polarizations of light from entering the second beamsplitter completely \u2013 the equivalent of blocking one of the slits in the double slit experiment. However, in this case, half of the photons are never detected at all. There is thus an unbeatable trade-off between distinguishability and visibility. They found that, no matter what they chose as the phase, there was a fixed lower bound on the measurement uncertainty that was consistent with the theory presented in 2014 by Coles and colleagues.\n\nThe Link\u00f6ping team plans to develop practical applications of its technology. \u201cWe can change the settings quite fast,\u201d says Xavier, \u201cso our goal is to look at the implementation of some actual quantum communication protocols using these kinds of measurements \u2013 we are looking at some delayed choice experiments based on this setup.\u201d\n\nTheoretical physicist Jonas Maziero of the Federal University of Santa Maria in Brazil is impressed by the work. \u201cThe experiment is innovative, it\u2019s precise, it agrees very well with theory and it confirms an important result that\u2019s been in the literature for more than ten years now,\u201d he says.\n\nHe cautions, however, that the work does not fully confirm Coles\u2019 predictions. \u201cThe result reported [by Xavier and colleagues] applies to distinguishability based complementarity-based relations that use which-path detectors to quantify the particle-like behaviour of the quantum system. There are others based on predictability and using entanglement that are not contained within this framework.\u201d Extending the research to try to cover all cases would be interesting follow-up work, he says.\n\nThe research is described in Science Advances."

            "article_content": "QUESTION: Why was antimony so prized by alchemists?\n\nSir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), the towering genius of the Scientific Revolution, was dubbed \u2018the last of the magicians\u2019 by John Maynard Keynes. It is often forgotten that Newton was obsessed with alchemy, having written more than a million words on the subject.\n\nAlchemy was an ancient practice that combined elements of science, philosophy and mysticism. It aimed to transform base metals like lead into noble ones such as gold, discover a universal elixir of life, and understand the fundamental nature of matter and existence.\n\nAntimony\u2019s very reactivity with usually inert elements made it fascinating to alchemists.\n\nNewton held that antimony, along with quicksilver (mercury), was the foundation of alchemy: \u2018That other (and properly named) chalybs is antimony for it is created from nature of itself (without art) and it is the beginning of the work.\u2019 (In alchemy the chalybs was a foundation chemical of \u2018the Art\u2019.)\n\nOutside its supposed alchemical properties, antimony is a chemical element belonging to the nitrogen group. It has the atomic number 51 and is a lustrous, silvery-grey semi-metal with a flaky texture. Unlike typical metals, antimony is not malleable but hard and brittle and can be crushed to a powder.\n\nA unique property of antimony is that, because its solid form is less dense than its liquid form, it expands as it freezes (like water).\n\nThe word antimony comes from the Greek anti and monos: \u2018a metal not found alone\u2019 and it can be found in more than 100 different minerals. Its chemical symbol is Sb, which comes from the element\u2019s historical Latin name, stibium.\n\nAntimony became widely used in Medieval times, mainly to harden lead, although some was taken medicinally as a laxative pill. Today about half of all antimony is used to make antimony trioxide for flame-proofing.\n\nSir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), English Mathematician And Physicist. Colored English Line And Stipple Engraving, 19th Century\n\nCharles Rees, Warwick\n\nQUESTION: What became of New Zealand\u2019s Moriori people?\n\nThe Moriori were an indigenous Polynesian people who settled the Chatham Islands, east of New Zealand, around the 14th century. They had a relatively peaceful hunter-gatherer lifestyle, relying on seal meat and seafood and adapting to the Chatham Islands\u2019 harsh and cold environment.\n\nTomorrow's questions:\n\n\n\nQ: It took 24 years for Gladiator II to be released after Gladiator. What are the longest time gaps between original feature films andtheir first sequel? John Rutherford, Sevenoaks, Kent Q: What did the Keeper of the King\u2019s Conscience do? Martine Garner, Norwich Q: Was a postbox installed in a crematorium? What was it for? Will Livesy, Truro, Cornwall Advertisement\n\nThey developed a pacifist, collectivist culture known as the law of Nunuku, based on the teachings of the 16th-century Moriori leader Nunuku-whenua.\n\nMeanwhile, the main islands of New Zealand were settled by the Maori, who developed an agricultural and warlike society, with fortified villages and organised tribal structures.\n\nIn 1835, Maori tribes from mainland New Zealand invaded the Chatham Islands, seeking new resources and territory. The Moriori, adhering to their principle of nonviolence, did not resist. They were enslaved and killed. The Moriori population fell from around 1,600 to fewer than 100 within 30 years.\n\nA Moriori survivor recalled: \u2018[They] commenced to kill us like sheep... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed.\u2019\n\nThe Moriori suffered injustice after injustice; after 30 years of slavery, the Chatham Islands were awarded to their invaders in an 1870 Native Land Court decision.\n\nThere was a systematic portrayal of Moriori as a \u2018lazy, stupid people\u2019 genetically distinct from Maori and Polynesians. This description could be found in a 1916 copy of School Journals, a series of educational magazines used across New Zealand elementary schools. The last known full-blooded Moriori, Tommy Solomon (Tame Horomona Rehe), died in 1933.\n\nEmilia Turner, London SE27\n\nQUESTION: Is Valiasr Street in Tehran the longest residential street in the world?\n\nValiasr Street, the longest in the Iranian capital (and in the Middle East), spans 11 miles from Rahahan Square in the south to Tajrish Square in the north. Built in the 1920s under Reza Shah Pahlavi, it was originally called Pahlavi Street. It was renamed Valiasr or Vali-e Asr following the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\n\nValiasr Street is the longest in the Iranian capital, Tehran (pictured) and it spans 11 miles from Rahahan Square in the south to Tajrish Square in the north\n\nYonge Street in Toronto, Canada, is the longest street in the world. Measuring 34 miles, it connects Lake Ontario in the south to Lake Simcoe in the north.\n\nThe longest street in Britain is disputed, with both Duke Street in Glasgow and King Street in Aberdeen commonly claiming to be two miles long.\n\nSteven Lewis, Coventry"
