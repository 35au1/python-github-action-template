            "article_content": "PALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 At a recent medical checkup, the doctor showed up with artificial intelligence. I got to see AI\u2019s possibilities and problems play out in a very personal way. \u201cBefore we start, I want to just ask you a quick question,\u201d Stanford Health Care\u2019s Christopher Sharp says, opening an app on his smartphone. \u201cI\u2019m using a technology that records our conversation and uses artificial intelligence to summarize and make my notes for me.\u201d\n\nSkip to end of carousel Geoffrey A. Fowler (Se\u00f1or Salme for The Washington Post) . Read more. Geoff\u2019s column hunts for how tech can make your life better \u2014 and advocates for you when tech lets you down. Got a question or topic to investigate? Geoffrey.Fowler@washpost.com End of carousel\n\nDuring the exam, Sharp makes a point of saying my blood pressure and other findings out loud so his AI scribe will hear him. He also uses AI to help write first drafts of answers to patient messages, including suggested treatment advice.\n\nAI is coming to your relationship with your doctor, if it hasn\u2019t already. Over the past year, millions of people have started being treated by health providers using AI for repetitive clinical work. The hope is that it will make doctors less stressed out, speed up treatment and possibly spot mistakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s exciting. But what I find a little scary is that medicine \u2014 traditionally a conservative, evidence-based profession \u2014 is adopting AI at the hyper speed of Silicon Valley. These AI tools are being widely adopted in clinics even as doctors are still testing when they\u2019re a good idea, a waste of time or even dangerous.\n\nThe harm of generative AI \u2014 notorious for \u201challucinations\u201d \u2014 producing bad information is often difficult to see, but in medicine the danger is stark. One study found that out of 382 test medical questions, ChatGPT gave an \u201cinappropriate\u201d answer on 20 percent. A doctor using the AI to draft communications could inadvertently pass along bad advice.\n\nAnother study found that chatbots can echo doctors\u2019 own biases, such as the racist assumption that Black people can tolerate more pain than White people. Transcription software, too, has been shown to invent things that no one ever said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPatients are already pushing the boundaries by using consumer chatbots to diagnose illness and recommend treatments.\n\nIn the clinic, the buzz around ChatGPT has fast-tracked AI to the roles of draft message writer and \u201cambient scribe\u201d that takes notes. Epic Systems, the largest provider of electronic health records in America, says the generative AI tools it sells are already being used to transcribe about 2.35 million patient visits and draft 175,000 messages each month.\n\nAnd Epic tells me it has 100 more AI products in development, including ones that can queue up orders mentioned during a visit and provide a practitioner with a review of a previous shift. Start-ups are going even further: Glass Health offers doctors AI-generated recommendations on diagnoses and treatment plans, and K Health offers patients health-care advice through its own chatbot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s even more worrisome is that, so far, little of this AI software requires approval by the Food and Drug Administration because it\u2019s technically not making medical decisions on its own. Doctors are still supposed to check the AI\u2019s output \u2014 thoroughly, we hope.\n\n\u201cI do think this is one of those promising technologies, but it\u2019s just not there yet,\u201d says Adam Rodman, an internal medicine doctor and AI researcher at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. \u201cI\u2019m worried that we\u2019re just going to further degrade what we do by putting hallucinated \u2018AI slop\u2019 into high-stakes patient care.\u201d\n\nNobody wants doctors to be Luddites. But the details really matter regarding what AI can, and can\u2019t, be trusted to do.\n\nIn the clinic\n\nSharp isn\u2019t my ordinary primary care doctor, but he agreed to see me to demonstrate both the ambient scribe and email-drafting AI. He\u2019s also a professor and Stanford Health Care\u2019s chief medical information officer, responsible for researching how AI performs and deciding what\u2019s worth rolling out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Sharp activates his AI, I understand how some might find the idea creepy. \u201cIt is completely private,\u201d he says, adding that the recording will be destroyed after its contents have been extracted.\n\nWhile Sharp examines me, something remarkable happens: He makes eye contact the entire time. Most medical encounters I\u2019ve had in the past decade involve the practitioner spending at least half the time typing at a computer.\n\nThe goal is more than just improving bedside manner. An unyielding tide of administrative tasks is a leading cause of doctor burnout. Because of electronic records and legal requirements, one study found that for every hour of directly interacting with patients, some doctors spend nearly two extra hours writing reports and doing other desk work.\n\nSharp\u2019s software, called DAX Copilot from Microsoft\u2019s Nuance, not only transcribes a visit, but also organizes and extracts a summary. \u201cIt basically drafts it, and I\u2019ll be doing my own work to make sure it is accurate,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter squashing a technical bug that initially caused the AI to fail, Sharp shows me the final product. \u201cThe patient presents for evaluation of a persistent cough,\u201d the document begins.\n\nThe doctor made one notable edit to the AI draft: correcting its assertion that I had attributed my cough to exposure from my 3-year-old. (I had mentioned it as only one possible source.) Sharp changed the file to say it \u201cmay relate.\u201d\n\nWhile I\u2019m still in his office, Sharp also demonstrates the patient messaging AI he\u2019s been helping Stanford pilot for a year.\n\nHere, too, the need is real. During covid lockdowns, a flood of patients began sending messages to doctors rather than booking appointments, and that hasn\u2019t stopped. The AI is supposed to help doctors churn through responses more efficiently by getting them started with a draft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this demo doesn\u2019t go as well. Sharp picks a patient query at random. It reads: \u201cAte a tomato and my lips are itchy. Any recommendations?\u201d\n\nThe AI, which uses a version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, drafts a reply: \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear about your itchy lips. Sounds like you might be having a mild allergic reaction to the tomato.\u201d The AI recommends avoiding tomatoes, using an oral antihistamine \u2014 and using a steroid topical cream.\n\nSharp stares at his screen for a moment. \u201cClinically, I don\u2019t agree with all the aspects of that answer,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAvoiding tomatoes, I would wholly agree with. On the other hand, topical creams like a mild hydrocortisone on the lips would not be something I would recommend,\u201d Sharp says. \u201cLips are very thin tissue, so we are very careful about using steroid creams.\n\n\u201cI would just take that part away.\u201d\n\nOpen questions\n\nHow often does AI draft that sort of questionable medical advice?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcross campus from Sharp, Stanford medical and data science professor Roxana Daneshjou has been trying to find out by pummeling the software with questions \u2014 known as \u201cred teaming.\u201d\n\nShe opens her laptop to ChatGPT and types in a test patient question. \u201cDear doctor, I have been breastfeeding and I think I developed mastitis. My breast has been red and painful.\u201d ChatGPT responds: Use hot packs, perform massages and do extra nursing.\n\nBut that\u2019s wrong, says Daneshjou, who is also a dermatologist. In 2022, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine recommended the opposite: cold compresses, abstaining from massages and avoiding overstimulation.\n\nDaneshjou has done this sort of testing on a wider scale, gathering 80 people \u2014 a mix of computer scientists and physicians \u2014 to pose real medical questions to ChatGPT and rate its answers. \u201cTwenty percent problematic responses is not, to me, good enough for actual daily use in the health care system,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother study evaluating AI on questions about cancer found that its answers posed a risk of \u201csevere harm\u201d 7 percent of the time.\n\nIt\u2019s not that chatbots can\u2019t do some impressive things \u2014 or keep getting better. The problem is that they\u2019re designed to respond with an \u201caverage\u201d answer, says Rachel Draelos, a physician and computer scientist who founded the health tech start-up Cydoc. \u201cBut nobody\u2019s an average. What makes medicine really interesting is that every patient is an individual and needs to be treated that way.\u201d\n\nAcademic studies of Whisper, a transcription software released by ChatGPT maker OpenAI, have found that it is prone to making up text in ways that could lead to a misinterpretation of the speaker. Daneshjou\u2019s research has also highlighted problems with the summarization part of the scribe job, showing how AI can at times include hallucinated details \u2014 like, in one example, assuming that a Chinese patient is a computer programmer.\n\nUnlike those studies, the AI models used by clinics typically have been fine-tuned for medical use. Epic, the software company, wouldn\u2019t share error rates from its internal tests. \u201cTo truly assess the accuracy of AI outputs, testing and validation must be based on local customer data,\u201d says an Epic spokeswoman.\n\nAnecdotally, some clinics report that doctors keep most of what the AI transcribes: Sharp says that earlier versions were too verbose and had problems with pronouns but that today it is \u201chighly accurate\u201d and used by two-thirds of the Stanford doctors who have access.\n\nAI scribes seem inevitable to many doctors I spoke with, but whether it actually saves them time is an open question. A study published in November of one of the first academic health systems to use AI scribes found that the tech \u201cdid not make clinicians as a group more efficient.\u201d Other reports have suggested it saves 10 or 20 minutes.\n\nAnd what about the draft messages? How often does the AI go off the rails? \u201cThe basic answer is we don\u2019t know,\u201d says Sharp, noting that Stanford\u2019s studies are ongoing. Doctors have been much slower to adopt messaging, he says, but those who use it report that it helps with burnout and being more compassionate in replies.\n\nWhether it makes them more efficient is, again, questionable. A study at the University of California, San Diego, found that doctors in their pilot of the AI messaging program spent significantly more time reading, possibly because they were scrutinizing drafts for hallucinations.\n\nHumans in the loop\n\nHow should you feel if your doctor is using AI? Ultimately, it comes down to how much you trust your doctor.\n\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t yet have confidence that these tools can substitute for my judgment,\u201d Sharp says. \u201cI am growing in a lot of confidence that these tools can relieve my burden on some of my administrative work.\u201d\n\nIt works, Sharp says, because he is careful to always check the AI\u2019s work.\n\nBut what actually happens to doctors\u2019 judgment when they get AI tools is another open question for researchers.\n\nDaneshjou compares it to tourists in Hawaii who drive into the water because their GPS told them to. \u201cWe trust our systems so much that sometimes we override what we can see with our own two eyes,\u201d she says.\n\nDoctors need to be trained on how AI can be wrong. There\u2019s a particular risk for bias, says Rodman, that we know gets encoded into AI like ChatGPT, which is trained on human language. \u201cWhat happens when a biased human interacts with a biased AI?,\u201d he says. \u201cDoes it make them even more biased? Does it not have as big an effect? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re wary about your doctor\u2019s AI, ask to see the notes or summary of your visit to review it yourself. As for AI-drafted messages from your doctor, some organizations require them to include a disclosure, though Stanford Health Care does not.\n\nThe University of California, San Francisco, which rolled out AI scribe software widely earlier this month, is watching how much editing the doctors do of the AI documents over time.\n\n\u201cIf we see less editing happening, either the technology\u2019s getting better or there\u2019s a risk humans are becoming intellectually reliant on the tool,\u201d says Sara Murray, chief health AI officer at UCSF.\n\nMedicine has a tendency to make its point of comparison perfection, but of course, doctors themselves aren\u2019t perfect. \u201cIf there are things that we can do to improve efficiency and access and it\u2019s imperfect, but better than the current state, then it likely has some value,\u201d Murray says.\n\nWhile these big academic medical institutions are researching the right kinds of questions and putting up guardrails, smaller institutions and clinics are also rolling out AI at an unprecedented clip."

It represents Google's return to the mixed-reality space after consigning Google Glass to enterprise and discontinuing Google Cardboard and Daydream. Sameer Samat, president of the Google ecosystem, assured us that they \"never stopped working on\" XR despite these public failures and that the \"Gemini era\" means \"the time is right for XR.\"\n\nWhile Google may make Android XR hardware in the future, demos like Project Astra's multimodal AI may remain internal prototypes to focus on Android XR software for other brands \u2014 primarily Samsung \u2014 making XR devices.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndroid XR may be the most exciting version of Android in years, but anyone unfamiliar with VR headsets or smart glasses may be confused about what Android XR is and what it's built to do. This guide will run through the basics of what to expect, from Samsung's Project Moohan to Google's XR plans for Gemini.\n\nWhat is Android XR?\n\n\"Android eXtended Reality\" is an Android spinoff platform that's designed for wearable devices, similar to Wear OS in that it's (A) co-designed with Samsung and (B) has to deliver efficient processing in a smaller form factor like glasses.\n\nXR is a common industry term encompassing virtual, augmented, and mixed-reality devices. Smart glasses don't typically fall under this umbrella since they have no reality-changing display, only audio; Google has included it, however, because it'll use the same baseline Gemini assistant as AR glasses.\n\nAndroid XR software will underpin the XR headsets and glasses hardware, giving them access to Play Store apps that you won't get on other platforms \u2014 mainly Meta's Horizon OS on Quest.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe platform itself supports certain universal features like hand/controller tracking with external cameras or eye tracking with inward cameras \u2014 both enabling the kind of controls you see on the Apple Vision Pro. However, hardware developers will need to make devices that can take advantage of these tools.\n\nWhat apps will run on Android XR?\n\nA look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality\n\nGoogle Gemini is \"at the core\" of Android XR, the company says. Whether it's a headset or glasses, it'll use sensors and cameras so that Gemini can \"see what you see, whether it's digital or real content, hear what you hear, and react to your gestures alongside your voice.\"\n\nWith the conversationality of Gemini Live, paired with multimodal AI insights, Android XR will let you use natural voice commands to control the UI or ask contextual questions about what you're seeing, either in real life or in XR apps.\n\nOutside of Gemini, Google has promised 360\u00ba videos on YouTube or Google TV, 3D Google Photos, Google Maps Immersive View, Google Meet, and Chrome with common AI tricks like Circle to Search.\n\nA mock-up of Android XR showing floating Chrome screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room. It shows the after-effect of a Circle to Search tool finding data on a soccer player's shoe.\n\nBeyond Google apps, Android XR is compatible with both WebXR and OpenXR, the most common standards for web-based and native XR apps across the industry. That should mean many Meta Quest games should port over to compatible Android XR headsets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Android XR SDK also supports Android Studio, ARCore, Jetpack Compose, and Unity. Any current Android apps will \"just work\" on Android XR (according to Google) as long as the developer opts in, though this will probably be a floating window in the \"infinite desktop\" virtual space; developers will want to optimize the app to the OS for any 3D visual effects. A few devs have already developed apps for Android XR with early access, including MLB, Calm, and Adobe.\n\nAndroid XR hardware: Project Moohan and others\n\nAn official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSamsung revealed its XR headset, Project Moohan, at the same time as Google's Android XR; Moohan means \"Infinity\" in Korean, matching the theme. Samsung promises \"state-of-the-art displays, Passthrough capabilities, and natural multi-modal input\" but hasn't specified what specs it'll have when it launches to consumers in 2025.\n\nWe do know it'll use the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2, the chipset announced in January 2024 that supports up to 4.3K per eye, plus a 20% CPU boost and 15% GPU boost over the XR2 Gen 2 in the Meta Quest 3. However, it's not guaranteed that Moohan will hit that resolution.\n\nBased on the render above \u2014 plus private demos given to a few outlets \u2014 we know Samsung's XR headset will have a comfortable Elite-style strap, as well as a removable light shield for better immersion during VR experiences but less isolation during mixed-reality apps. It'll have outer IR cameras for tracking hands or controllers, plus inward cameras for eye tracking.\n\nWhile Samsung has its own apps and Galaxy AI built off of Gemini, we believe Android XR (and Moohan) will default to Google apps and multimodal Gemini AI for commands and navigation, based on what we heard from Samsung.\n\nCreating 3D objects with the unnamed Sony XR headset\n\nOther Android XR hardware developers will likely choose the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 as well, given that Google partnered with Qualcomm and optimized the platform for its silicon. Google has confirmed that Xreal, Sony, and Lynx will develop Android XR devices.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt CES 2024, Sony announced an XR headset with the XR2+ Gen 2, 4K OLED micro-displays with pancake lenses that you can flip up like a visor, and 3D productivity software. It's the most likely candidate for Sony's Android XR device.\n\nXreal recently announced spatial AR glasses with up to 57-degree FoV and an add-on Xreal Eye Camera for capturing 1080p video and sending data to your phone for \"multimodal AI.\" We don't think these glasses will support Android XR, but that camera sounds like the precursor to a newer version with Google software and Gemini built-in, with your Android phone powering things.\n\nLynx, whose current XR headset has dealt with delays and controversy, will develop a new Android XR headset rather than update the R1, based on a statement made to UploadVR.\n\nWill Google make an Android XR device?\n\nA screenshot from the Google I/O presentation showing a Google engineer wearing AR glasses with a camera and Gemini AI capabilities.\n\nGoogle is taking a backseat to Samsung in terms of releasing an actual Android XR device, focusing on software. At least for now!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn 2023, The Information reported on Google's XR prototypes, including Project Moohan, a monocular Google Glass-lookalike codenamed \"Betty,\" a two-display spin-off called \"Barry,\" and an unnamed pair of smart glasses from former Magic Leap CTO Paul Greco and his team.\n\nIt's very possible that these devices are nothing more than prototypes developed to test Android XR, rather than anything planned for wide release. But Google did show off its own Android XR smart glasses demo to sites like The Verge with multimodal AI capabilities, and it also showed a glimpse of these glasses at I/O 2024 (see the screenshot above).\n\nIt's possible that Google could join in on the Android XR fun, but it evidently wants to try and let its partners establish themselves first before cutting in on the action. It's similar to how Google co-developed the new version of Wear OS with Samsung in 2021 but didn't release its first Pixel Watch until late 2022.\n\nAndroid XR vs. Meta Horizon OS\n\nAn official concept image of a potential Meta Horizon OS VR headset\n\nThe biggest rival to Android XR will be Meta Horizon OS, the system behind Quest headsets. Meta is the most established brand in the XR space, and it tried to get Google to give Quest headsets Play Store access, only for Google to insist that Meta use Android XR, which Meta rebuffed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMeta itself made Meta Horizon OS open to partners in 2024, announcing that Lenovo and ASUS ROG would make XR headsets with Meta software and apps. Meta and Xbox also plan to coordinate on a limited-edition headset.\n\nMeta has a full library of games it can share with partners, as well as Meta AI. What it doesn't have is access to a Play Store full of apps and a development pipeline designed to convert phone apps into Android XR apps, like Google has; it has to use progressive web apps, and it's had very few productivity partners thus far.\n\nBoth platforms use Snapdragon chipsets, hand tracking, and UIs that float windows in virtual or mixed-reality space. Meta has its own popular Ray-Ban smart glasses, and the promise of Meta Orion AR glasses in 2027, and they both use a similar interface to the Quest.\n\nAll of this is to say, Meta Horizon and Android XR have similar goals, methods, and devices. It's far too soon to say if Android XR will be better, worse, or a clone of Meta Horizon. What matters most is that Meta and Google will challenge one another, which ideally will lead to greater innovation in the XR space."

            "article_content": "New Delhi: India\u2019s technology sector is likely to see generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) and related data applications define client orders, financial growth and technical innovation in 2025. In turn, this is expected to generate a spurt in demand for data centres and their services.\n\nIndustry stakeholders ranging from the US\u2019s Big Tech firms, as well as data centre and software services companies, are gearing up for a boom in demand amid expectations of easing inflation concerns in the West, and the Indian government\u2019s boost to domestic research and development (R&D) expenditure in the coming year.\n\nOn 12 December, Mint reported that the Centre was evaluating plans to roll out $3 billion in incentives to boost R&D in India. The country, already a hub for fresh technical talent, is now looking to invest in innovation to climb up the value ladder\u2014as opposed to being a usage economy so far.\n\nAlso read | The next great leap in AI is behind schedule and crazy expensive\n\nAt the core of this push is the establishment of generative AI as a key differentiator in the near term, and its impact on data centres.\n\nOn 28 September, Mint reported that the Adani group is likely to pump in $4 billion to establish a net data centre capacity of 1.5GW (gigawatt) within the next two years, a plan that originally had a timeline of five years. This boost is driven by the influx of AI in enterprises, and the anticipated data boom that is expected to come with it.\n\nAshish Arora, chief executive of Bharti Enterprises\u2019 subsidiary Nxtra, also added that the company is investing $600 million to double its net data centre capacity to 400MW (megawatt) by 2026, a chunk of which will be expanded in 2025 itself.\n\nEarlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Yotta Data Services, a subsidiary of the Hiranandani Group, is close to finalizing a $500-million investment through a group of creditors to expand its data centre \u2018parks\u2019, which are already operational in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Greater Noida and Maharashtra\u2019s Navi Mumbai regions.\n\nThe uptick comes even as generative AI has struggled to keep up with its heightened hype of rapidly transforming businesses. Driven by data privacy and copyright concerns, enterprises have largely remained cautious in adopting the technology rapidly through this year.\n\nAlso read | How scammers are using AI this holiday season to steal your money\n\nThe early signs of change, however, are here. On 19 December, Accenture, the world\u2019s largest technology services outsourcing and consultancy firm and a bellwether for India\u2019s $300-billion IT services sector, disclosed $1.2 billion in net new generative AI deals with businesses worldwide. generative AI, thus, comprised 6.4% of total new business during the company\u2019s Q1FY25 period, which in its reporting runs from September to November.\n\nThe first week of January, thus, will be key to see if India\u2019s IT services stalwarts, led by heavyweights Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and HCL Technologies, can keep up with Accenture\u2019s pace of executing generative AI applications with clients.\n\nEarlier this fiscal, K. Krithivasan, chief executive of TCS, had said that the company has a business pipeline worth $1.5 billion for generative AI. During the company\u2019s October earnings call for Q2FY25, Krithivasan further added that the company has 600 active generative AI projects. However, crucially, he declined to comment on the amount of revenue TCS is drawing from AI\u2019s youngest brainchild.\n\nAdoption likely to rise\n\nIndustry stakeholders, however, are bullish that 2025 is likely to see generative AI go on a stronger run of adoption, as the technology itself becomes more mature, and businesses find a way to implement them at the core.\n\nOn 11 December, Google announced its new generation of generative AI models under the Gemini 2.0 suite, underlining its suitability for \u2018agentic\u2019 AI applications, which experts said was a clear sign of the company trying to convince businesses of the technology\u2019s usability.\n\n\u201cAI isn\u2019t just an enabler anymore\u2014it\u2019s becoming the backbone of how industries innovate, scale, and solve their most complex challenges,\" said Sindhu Gangadharan, chairperson of Centre-affiliated think-tank Nasscom, and managing director of SAP Labs India. \u201cAI is evolving from being assistive to becoming truly intelligent, with autonomous agents capable of making decisions and orchestrating entire ecosystems.\n\nGangadharan added that custom AI, in particular, is emerging as a transformative force in 2025, allowing organizations to design AI solutions tailored to their specific needs. \u201cThis trend is set to democratize AI innovation. For India, this is an incredible opportunity\u2014we\u2019re perfectly positioned to lead this AI-driven transformation,\" she said.\n\n\u201cMore organizations are experimenting with building custom AI solutions tailored to industry needs, including custom copilots and AI agents,\" said Irina Ghose, managing director of Microsoft India. She added that Indian enterprises are at the forefront of this shift in scaling AI and data use cases to \u201cdrive innovation, improve productivity and streamline workflows\u2014bringing India on the brink of an AI-driven renaissance\".\n\nAlso read | The AI robots on their way will mostly be made in Asia\n\nGhose further added that as far as generative AI is concerned, there is no doubt that with the right combination of data and associated computing power, businesses across industries can be considerably redefined.\n\n\"2024 was the year of AI in action, and we saw a transformative shift in how companies approach AI, moving from exploration to execution. Increasingly, more and more organizations are experimenting with building custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs, including custom copilots and AI agents. The business opportunity of AI is clear. According to an IDC study, for every dollar a company invests in generative AI, the return on investment is 3.7x. On top of this, 92% of AI deployments are taking 12 months or less at an enterprise level,\" Ghose said.\n\nIpsita Dasgupta, managing director of HP India, said it was important to empower SMBs (small and medium businesses), which contribute about 30% of GDP but face various barriers, with AI technology. \u201cThe future of work means a more flexible, inclusive and digitally connected environment where technology empowers individuals and businesses of all sizes. AI PCs and advanced workstations will be at the core of this change,\" Dasgupta said.\n\nThe key, experts believe, will be in how generative AI grows in the coming year. Pointing out that generative AI is still only a two-year old technology, Jayanth Kolla, partner at tech consultant Convergence Catalyst, said we are still understanding a lot about it.\n\n\u201cThat said, the advent of domain-specific applications through generative AI is a key area of business interest, and whichever way you look at it, the boom in data centre demand is unavoidable in India as a result. As enterprises ramp up AI consumption, this demand will only rise, without any concerns of slowdown or saturation at least in the near-term,\" Kolla said.\n\nThere are also new directions that AI and data centre evolutions can take in the coming year. For AI, much will depend on what the US behemoths of Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI will do in the coming year. 2024 already saw reasoning AI make a debut, although the use cases of the latter will only build over time. For data centres, figuring out the energy consumption conundrum will be key, as net-zero and climate change accord targets inch closer.\n\nThe earliest proof of the generative AI pudding, each stakeholder agrees, is likely going to come in the first quarter of the upcoming fiscal\u2014suggesting that the true boom in AI and data centres could take until at least the middle of the year to play out. Despite that, all of them are certain that unlike the promise of 5G or satellite internet, there are no external factors that can stop 2025 from being the year for data centres and generative AI to define India\u2019s tech industries."

Our data shows that, yes, there are instances like that of course, but there are many other cases that are evidential.\n\n\"For example, being witnessed by more than one person, or these crisis cases where they didn't even know the person was dead.\n\n\"Across the board, these stories are often coming from very highly educated people with very good jobs, and not everybody's bereaved.\"\n\n'The paranormal is normal'\n\nA 2023 paper by J.K.Penberthy and others, in collaboration with the University of Northampton, discovered that 27 per cent of research participants who had ADC experiences identified as not being in a state of grieving or mourning.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, electrical phenomena in ADCs has massively increased over the years, too, presumably due to the growing number of devices the average person uses now.\n\n\"If we\u2019re to believe that the deceased live on somewhere, then they are seemingly more and more able to affect electronics and phones,\" Sophie says.\n\n\"I\u2019ve had evidence of things like, 'My deceased husband sends me text messages every week', 'I\u2019ve had a voicemail from my brother after he passed on', and switched-off iPads suddenly playing the departed\u2019s favourite song.\n\n\"Physical phenomena is very common.\"\n\nThe beliefs of Brits AROUND half (46 per cent) of Brits believe in life after death, according to a study by Kings College London. Gen Z (51 per cent) and Millenials (53 per cent) have the highest rates of belief. But the share of the British public who identify as religious has halved since the 1980s. The UK public are now among the least likely internationally to believe in God. Just under half (49 per cent) of Brits said they believed in God in 2022 \u2013 down from three-quarters (75 per cent) in 1981. Of 24 nations in the study, only five are now less likely than the UK to say they believe in God, with China (17 per cent) by far the least likely to. And the share of the British public who say God is not important in their life has doubled and is now at a record high, rising from 28 per cent to 57 per cent between 1981 and 2022. Between 1981 and 2022, the share of the public believing in heaven fell from 57 per cent to 41 per cent. Despite this, the idea of heaven is still more popular than hell, which 26 per cent said they believed in in 2022 \u2013 a figure largely unchanged since trends began. While younger people have lower levels of religious belief and are more likely to identify as atheists, Gen Z (32 per cent) and Millennials (32 per cent) are in fact more likely than Baby Boomers (18 per cent) and the Pre-War generation (24 per cent) to believe in hell. And by international standards, the UK is less likely to believe in hell, ranking 17th out of 24 countries \u2013 and far behind some peer nations such as the US (69 per cent) and Italy (39 per cent). Views on life after death have held up well over the last four decades, with just under half of the public \u2013 including 46 per cent in 2022 \u2013 consistently saying they believe in it, the study found.\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to prove that there really is life after death, Sophie says it\u2019s the impact of these experiences on the grieving process that is really important.\n\nThe ADC questionnaire has shown that the majority found the ADCs comforting (81 per cent) and helpful in their bereavement (84 per cent).\n\nOnly 12 per cent of respondents in the study reported their ADC as frightening.\n\n\"The main aim of this work is to show the public that the paranormal is normal,\" she adds.\n\n\"And these experiences can have positive psychological effects.\n\n\"Real or not, these experiences mean the world to people who have them.\n\n\"Neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud described sensing the presence of the deceased as \u2018hallucinatory wishful psychosis\u2019, and he advised we cut emotional attachment to deceased loved ones.\n\n\"Well, now there are quite a lot of studies proving that being open to a connection with a deceased loved one is really beneficial to the grieving process and mental health.\"\n\nAnother key impact of an ADC is of course a new belief in life after death, something 92.8 per cent of study participants now say they hold.\n\n\"Going by the messages we\u2019ve received, it\u2019s beneficial for the deceased, too,\" says Sophie.\n\n\"Some people report being told that their departed loved one can't go much further while those left behind are so sad.\n\n\"They invite them to let that grief go, so they can get on with the next chapter.\"\n\nTo find out more and to contribute your ADC experiences to the study, visit adcrp.org or @after_death_communication, or buy a book based on the research on Amazon."

Many of us equate Peak Vampire with the late 2000s/early 2010s, when the Twilight franchise had teenagers lined up at the megaplex for midnight premieres. (I, of course, was one of them). But bloodsuckers have been drawing audiences since long before people knew the name Edward Cullen.\n\nThe monsters initially sank their fangs deep into Hollywood in the 1930s, upon the release of Dracula. Although the film wasn\u2019t Tinseltown\u2019s first vampire project, it was the first to reach a mainstream audience and achieve critical acclaim. Dracula\u2019s success inspired Universal to bring back the evil Count in five separate sequels and spin-offs in the years that followed\u2014arguably spawning one of Hollywood\u2019s first franchise behemoths. Since then, the vampire craze has ebbed and flowed, with the Twilight years relishing a noticeable spike.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA century later, vampires and Hollywood are definitely \u201con\u201d again. In the last few years alone, these creatures of the night are dominating the big and small screen through AMC\u2019s acclaimed Interview With the Vampire series, fun and bloody flicks like Abigail, and the much-anticipated Robert Eggers film Nosferatu. While we\u2019re all waiting for what promises to be Eggers\u2019s next masterpiece, we\u2019ve rounded up the best vampire movies and TV shows to satiate your thirst.\n\n\n\n\n\nNosferatu (1922)\n\nThe very first modern vampire movie wasn\u2019t about Dracula, per se, but fans of the Bram Stoker novel will notice some striking similarities in Nosferatu. In fact, Stoker\u2019s widow, Florence, sued the German silent film for copyright infringement after its 1922 premiere, and (almost) every copy was destroyed. But various fragments of the film survived and, after a lengthy restoration process, Nosferatu is now one the most well-known vampire movies ever made. One hundred years later, the film\u2019s antagonist Graf Orlok is scheduled to stalk the screen again in an remake by Robert Eggers, which releases Christmas Day.\n\nShop Now\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee the original post on Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\nDracula (1931)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to separate Dracula from actor Bela Lugosi. Not only was he the first to portray the Count on the silver screen, but he also starred in the 1920s Broadway production and in a Spanish-language Dracula film. (In a very on-brand macabre move, Lugosi was buried in his vampire costume when he died in 1956.) The 1931 movie was so successful that it launched the first Hollywood vampire craze, with subsequent titles including Son of Dracula, House of Dracula, Horror of Dracula, Dracula\u2019s Daughter, and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.\n\nShop Now\n\nSee the original post on Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Munsters (1964-1966)\n\nWhile Frankenstein-esque Herman Munster is the face of this 1960s sitcom, this wife guy wouldn\u2019t be anywhere without his vampire love Lily. Sure, Lily and her Dracula-inspired father are more interested in being a typical American family than sucking blood, but they can never escape spooking the neighbors with their not-so-human ways.

The horror-comedy follows two brothers who move to a California beach town and quickly discover that sinister beings (albeit with incredible hair) are lurking within the community.

The film follows hotshot executive Peter Loew (Cage) who begins to suspect that a romantic encounter has turned him into a creature of the night.

In its new whitepaper, 101 Technology Trends That Will\u2014and Won't\u2014Shape 2025, analysts from global technology intelligence firm ABI Research. ABI Research analysts identify 54 trends that will shape the technology market and 47 others that, although attracting vast amounts of speculation and commentary, are less likely to move the needle over the next twelve months. In the Digital Payment Technologies space, 2025 will see increased QR code payment acceptance but little growth for payment card IC ASPs.\n\n2024 Logo (PRNewsfoto/ABI Research)\n\n\"2024 has been marked by challenges, from global conflicts and inflationary pressures to political uncertainty. These factors have strained enterprise and consumer spending, leading to market inertia, short-term technology investments, sidelined capital, and the exposure of vulnerable suppliers,\" says Stuart Carlaw, Chief Research Officer at ABI Research. \"From a technology perspective, many industries and end markets are in that awkward stage of technology adoption where they are formulating implementation strategies, assessing solutions and partners, and trying to see if they have the resources needed to roll out solutions at scale. This is a particularly sensitive time, which tends to suggest 2025 will have tech implementers and end users on the brink of a period of a massive technology shift as they work through these issues.\"\n\nWhat Will Happen in 2025:\n\nQR code payment acceptance will continue to increase with use cases expanding\n\nAlthough QR code payment acceptance is prevalent in countries such as China and growing in emerging digital payment markets, including in India, use cases and potential growth areas are not limited to these countries. Significant and continued investments by vendors, including PayPal, Stripe, and SumUp, are setting the foundation for increased adoption in other mature and established economies with use cases expanding. Although QR codes are already being used by many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and pop-up retail businesses, 2025 will mark the year when the technology begins to shift from one niche to partial mainstream.\n\nWhat Won't Happen in 2025:\n\nPayment card IC ASPs will not return to pre-COVID-19 levels\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, chipset pricing has been on a continual rise, driven by increased pricing in myriad manufacturing areas, including energy, raw material, transit pricing, and inflation, driving up wages. The chip shortage further compounded this, and according to ABI Research, the Average Selling Price (ASP) for a payment card Integrated Circuit (IC) increased by approximately +30% between 2020 and 2023. However, despite pricing pressures returning, the cost of payment ICs is some years away from matching pre-COVID-19 levels. Although 2025 will mark another year of pricing deprecation, it will not be until around 2028 when pricing is expected to drop to levels similar to those achieved in 2019 steadily.\n\nStory Continues"

However, it\u2019s unclear if this was an isolated case or part of a widespread epidemic in the region.\n\nAlso known as the Black Death, the bubonic plague is one of history\u2019s most infamous diseases in history. It is spread when humans are bitten by fleas that piggyback on rodents\n\nWhen the microbes infect a human host, they ravage the lymphatic system, causing lymph nodes in the groin, underarm, and neck to balloon into swollen masses called buboes (hence the name).\n\n3 A depiction of a plague hospital in Vienna while the city was being besieged by the Turks in 1679. Bettmann Archive\n\nThe disease only snowballs from there, causing complications including seizures, vomiting blood, internal bleeding, and death.\n\nBubonic plague is most often associated with the notorious epidemic in 14th-century Europe \u2014 where it killed around 25 million people between 1347 and 1351 \u2014 as well as subsequent outbreaks in China, Mongolia and India.\n\nAnd while experts have long postulated about the plague\u2019s footprint in Egypt for decades, there hasn\u2019t been solid evidence for it \u2014 until now.\n\nIn 2004, scientists found millennia-old fleas at a repository on the banks of the Nile River.\n\nThere was also a 3,500-year-old Egyptian medical document describing a bubo filled with petrified pus, suggesting that the plague rats may have spread throughout the world by boat.\n\n3 The mummy is housed at the Egyptian Museum of Turin in Turin, Italy.

            "article_content": "Although the bubonic plague is most often associated with its deadly impact on 14th century Europe, traces of Yersinia pestis have also been found in skeletons found in modern-day Russia dating as far back as 5,000 years ago. Thanks to recent analysis, however, researchers believe they have confirmed the first known plague case outside Eurasia: a 3,290-year-old, ancient Egyptian mummy.\n\nY. pestis, also known as the Black Death, is one of history\u2019s most notorious diseases. Usually transmitted by fleas hitching a ride on rodents, the bubonic plague attacks the lymphatic system, and initially results in flu-like symptoms a few days after infection. From there, things often get far more grim\u2014and fatal. Lymph nodes in the groin, underarm, and neck begin to painfully swell while the infected victim develops a high-grade fever, chills, and even seizures. Hematemesis (vomiting blood) sets in, along with the swollen lymph nodes developing into buboes that often rupture. Internal hemorrhaging causes large portions to bruise and turn necrotic\u2014symptoms that earned the plague its \u201cBlack Death\u201d moniker. Without proper modern antibiotic treatments, 30-90 percent of patients can ultimately die as a result of the disease.\n\nApart from its spread through Europe between 1346 and 1353, the bubonic plague is believed to be the root cause of the Eastern Roman Empire\u2019s Plague of Justinian in the 6th century CE, as well as a third epidemic that occurred across China, Mongolia, and India in 1855. But as researchers explained during a presentation at the European Meeting of the Paleopathology Association, Y. pestis is confirmed to have existed at least at one point in ancient Egypt, as well.\n\nThe team reached their conclusion after examining a mummy housed in Italy\u2019s Museo Egizio that dates back to the Second Intermediate Period or early New Kingdom. According to researchers, DNA extracted from both intestinal contents and bone tissue contained traces of Y. pestis, implying the victim endured an advanced stage of the plague before dying.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

As IFL Science notes, a research team in 2004 found millennia-old fleas at an archeological site in Amarna on the banks of the Nile River. This, coupled with a 3,500-year-old Egyptian medical text known describing \u201ca bubo [whose] pus has petrified,\u201d led scientists to believe the Black Death arrived in communities along the riverbanks thousands of years ago. But without any direct evidence of Y. pestis, the theory remained unproven. The discovery of bubonic plague remnants in mummy DNA, however, appears to finally provide proof of its existence in ancient Egypt.\n\nThe team can\u2019t be sure how widespread Y. pestis was in the region just yet, but they hope their findings will help others \u201cstudy virulence-associated genes, and to characterize its possible modes of transmission and pathology.\u201d"

The smartphone market boom is a good testimony for it. That tech appetite is increasingly seen in the passenger vehicle market too, and it\u2019s not limited to the luxury segment. As ETAuto predicted last year , ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) qualified as a leading automotive tech trend of 2024.\u201cOn an average, over the last three months, ADAS for us is almost 1/4 of our overall portfolio, and that includes models which we launched much earlier,\u201d Nalinikanth Gollagunta , CEO of Mahindra & Mahindra\u2019s (M&M) Automotive Division told ETAuto.The emerging ADAS tech trend, which is still also a major USP for volume models, is expected to see a penetration level of 3% in the 4 million units Indian PV market, and around 5-6% in 2025, with the PV market clocking about 4.6 million units, according to market research firm Markets and Markets. The adoption level was around 2% in 2023.Automotive business intelligence firm Jato Dynamics\u2019 granular research shows standard rear parking distance sensor (52%), standard rear parking distance sensor & camera (47%), and auto activation hazard lights (39%) as the top three driving assistance features in terms of their industry penetration rate in India. On the Connected Vehicle tech side, remote services (29%), remote HVAC (16%), and remote start (7%), are listed as the leading ones.Mahindra & Mahindra, and MG Motor India (now JSW MG Motor India) are the lead players in the volume PV market when it comes to building businesses based on a strategy of democratising technology. The latter, which leveraged the Connected Vehicle and ADAS trends for brand MG\u2019s India market introduction, cites a projection that vehicles with advanced connected features will have an over 55% share by Q1 of 2027. And, vehicles with ADAS tech are expected to have an approximately 10% share.With these two major trends on the rise, Gaurav Gupta , Chief Growth Officer, JSW MG Motor India, says \u201cI will not be surprised if more than 80 % of customers would like to have a connected car. And, by 2030, we expect more than 30% new launches to have some level of ADAS.\u201dTechnology is increasingly becoming a crucial part in the savvy Indian consumer's vehicle purchase decision. \"Awareness has increased dramatically. Today customers decide their vehicle purchase within 3 main parameters Comfort, Safety, and Convenience. Comfort related to seating, Safety related to NCAP rating, and Convenience related to Connected Vehicle tech,\" says Kaushik Madhavan, VP - Automotive and Transportation, Markets and Markets.According to Gollagunta, the industry trend of ADAS is proving to be more than democratising technology. \u201cIt's democratising tech in our minds and bringing the volume up. But the second thing is, customers were looking at it as a safety feature (like the 360-degree camera view). The growing consumer awareness, and demand for ADAS has led M&M to \u2018democratise\u2019 the tech, by offering it in its compact SUV 3XO, and in all the AX variants of the Thar Roxx.The XUV700, launched in August \u201821, was the first Mahindra model to offer ADAS, in its top two variants. In the coming year or so, ADAS tech could become standard across all Mahindra models and variants as the solution also becomes more affordable with suppliers leveraging the economy of scale.2025 will see OEMs pushing the ADAS and connected tech envelopes even further. For example, M&M\u2019s \u2018electric origin\u2019 SUVs \u2013 BE 6 and XEV 9e, scheduled for launch in February, will have five radars to assist a more advanced tech suite. The OEM\u2019s ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) models with ADAS tech have one each.It\u2019s not only ADAS and Connected Vehicle tech that vehicles will rely on to woo customers in 2025. Display technology will also flex its muscle with different offerings to the driver, and other occupants in the vehicle. It\u2019s already beginning to happen. \u201cThe next battlefield in some form or shape, and it\u2019s already happening right now, is the amount of screen real estate which is there in each car,\u201d says Gollagunta.Like luxury cars, volume PV models will increasingly have more screens in the instrument panel/dashboard, and also offer screens for rear seat occupants. Global display technology major Visteon\u2019s CEO Sachin Lawande says, \u201cEvery car will have at least one large display, more likely two, if not more.\u201d For example, the upcoming Mahindra EVs will come with three screens, in their pillar-to-pillar display unit. Another two can be for the rear passengers.This growing trend of advanced display technology also makes Visteon see India as a 10 million unit automotive display market of display sizes 10 inches and higher, by the end of this decade.The growing global AI wave is also set to influence the in-car experience now. In the battle for customers\u2019 attention and interest, Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) will see major usage by OEMs in 2025. Especially to enhance the user experience. As Lawande puts it, \u201cAI is the new UI\u201d. The software driven technology can be almost revolutionary. \u201cThink about everything that you are currently doing with the system in the car, enhanced through AI,\u201d says the global industry leader.After Connected Vehicle tech, which is getting enhanced with 5G connectivity, and ADAS, Gollagunta counts AI as the third dimension of new automotive trends, which will also see major gains in 2025. \u201cVehicles will start to have a lot more augmented reality and AI capabilities built in,\u201d he says, and cites the example of heads-up display (HUD) with augmented reality in the Mahindra BE 6. AI for cameras in the vehicle, for facial recognition, driver drowsiness etc. will also see adoption in volume passenger vehicle models.As much as there the Indian market may offer great opportunity, thanks to its hunger for new technology, industry players will have to also meet the additional cost challenge that new technology usually comes with.\u201cNext year is going to be a year of consolidation, meaning that the inflation that has happened in costs, in getting here, whether it is battery costs, electronics cost, displays costs, we need to be able to drive strategies to make this cost become more affordable, so that the promise of the growth that we are all expecting can actually be delivered,\u201d says Lawande.To ride the India opportunity better, and also leverage the country\u2019s competitive production costs, Visteon looks to strike a collaboration or two with partners here for local production of its display products.Collaboration as a business growth or technology development strategy will see more traction in 2025. According to Raghavendra Vaidya , MD and CEO, Daimler Trucks Innovation Center, Daimler Truck\u2019s GCC (Global Capability Center) in India, collaboration across industries is set to be a major force driving India\u2019s automotive evolution, with strategic partnerships accelerating advancements in EV infrastructure, autonomous driving, and next-generation mobility solutions.He also adds that a significant emerging trend is the willingness of leading automotive companies to advance the development of cutting-edge software platforms, enhance vehicle connectivity, and build an integrated digital ecosystem.All the advanced automotive technology features that are beginning to emerge, and more to come in 2025 and beyond, will be enabled only by the software defined vehicle (SDV). This trend will also help OEMs to be more cost effective, while also helping democratise technology as multiple features can be based on the same software platform/architecture.If consumers lap up more software defined vehicles, the better it would be for both the buyers and vehicle manufacturers. \u201cThe more volume you get, you actually get more competitive and therefore technology democratisation, while it's good for customers, it's also good for us,\u201d says Gollagunta.Lawande expects softwarisation, along with digitalisation and electrification to gain more traction in 2025.With all the fares lined up for 2025, some already showcased, and more to come up in events next year, staring with the international mela of Bharat Mobility Expo, scheduled for 17-22 January, industry players would be hoping for a good drive in the coming year.,"

            "article_content": "With the global population aging, and rising concerns about mental health, loneliness, and social isolation, understanding and enhancing later-life satisfaction has become increasingly crucial for both individual and global health and productivity. The World Health Organization1 reports that by 2030, one out of six people will be 60 years or older, comprising 1.4 billion people, with those over 80 approaching half a billion.\n\nGiven the vast scope of this issue, it's surprising that we have a limited understanding of what preserves and enhances generativity in our later years, as research to date is still early-on. Along similar lines, increased generativity would be expected to enhance well-being, and protect against many of the negative outcomes currently associated with aging. With the global population getting older and the average human lifespan increasing, it is imperative to work out how to extend healthspan and productivity, meaning, purpose and community.\n\nDeveloping Machine Learning Approaches to Understand Complex Problems\n\nA recent study by Mohsen Joshanloo, Ph.D., published in the Journals of Gerontology (2024), took a novel approach using machine learning to extract key variables from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) dataset. This study included a wide range of psychological and demographic variables and measured generativity using the Loyola Generativity Scale. Participants ranged from 39 to 93 years old, with an average age of 63.64. Using maching learning allows us to make sense out of complicated data sets where standard statistical approaches may falter.\n\nFrom a broad perspective, a few key concepts help us understand aging across the lifespan. These include Erik Erikson\u2019s developmental model, especially Middle and Older Adulthood (below, with some flexibilty on the age spans given how long we're living nowadays); the balance of stability and plasticity (contributing to consistency and change); and the two major forms of well-being\u2014eudaimonic (meaning) and hedonic (pleasure), which need to be in harmony. Personality traits, measured by the Big Five (Five Factor Model, or FFM), play a role in this process, with some contributing to stability or plasticity. For example, openness to experience is linked with plasticity, while neuroticism, because of an anxious reluctance to take risks, is often associated with stability.\n\nSource: Robert.G Sacco, CC BY-SA 4.0 / Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe study used a \"Random Forest Analysis\" machine learning technique. This method builds multiple decision trees to sift through large datasets, identifying non-linear relationships and dynamic interactions. The model was trained on a subset of data and then tested against the rest to minimize prediction error and enhance accuracy. It analyzed 34 variables for 2,830 participants, after removing those with missing data and reducing the original 70 variables to a set of non-redundant measures.\n\nThe final model predicted 40% of the variance in generativity, revealing five key factors as the strongest predictors, ranked by significance:\n\nSocial Potency: Assertiveness, persuasion, and leadership orientation are crucial. Generativity is inherently social, requiring not just drive but also the interpersonal skills to lead and influence others. Openness: Mental flexibility and the ability to entertain new ideas and experiences are the second strongest predictors. This is consistent with the personality trait openness to experience, which has also been linked to giftedness2. Social Integration: This factor emphasizes the importance of social function in generativity. Beyond leadership, the ability to be part of a group, experience belonging, and find one\u2019s place in the social order is also critical. Social integration protects against loneliness, and the ill effects on health. Personal Growth: The drive for continuous development, particularly in later life, is another important contributor to generativity. As people age and face existential challenges, this drive to grow becomes even more significant. Achievement Orientation: The drive and passion to pursue goals is a key factor in generativity. A strong desire to get things done is inherently generative, though without the other factors, it may lack deeper meaning.\n\nAdditional important factors include a sense of purpose in life and self-acceptance, which highlight the importance of living a meaningful life (eudaimonia) and having a coherent life narrative. Generativity is influenced by how we view ourselves against the backdrop of our life story. Spiritual experiences also emerged as a relevant factor, pointing to the role of transcending quotidian concerns to see ourselves within a broader context.\n\nFactors that were not significant in this model included demographic and health factors such as gender, health status, and socioeconomic variables. While these factors have been important predictors of well-being and life satisfaction in other studies, the machine learning analysis suggests they may not be the most crucial drivers of generativity, though they likely influence the key factors mentioned above. They may be necessary but not sufficient for generativity, perhaps accomplishments from earlier stages of life and provision of basic needs, providing stability and an all-important springboard for generativity into later life.\n\nBecause the dataset is cross-sectional, the results are correlational rather than causal. Future research using machine learning approaches such as Random Forest Analysis, and others, could look at longitudinal data sets to determine causality and further explore additional variables that may influence generativity. Hybrid intelligence, synergizing human and artificial minds to go beyond the capacity of either alone, holds promise for addressing knotty problems.\n\nLiving Large\n\nWhile the jury is still out, this study identifies important factors which, beyond their statistical significance, make a certain intuitive sense when contemplating how to flourish and increase generativity as we grow older. Rather than fading away, focusing on social factors including both leadership and belonging emerges as important. Cultivating mental flexibility and openness to experience are core. Stability is important, but in excess may lead to stagnation, and failure to take necessary risks.\n\nPlasticity factors dovetail with personal growth orientation, flowing together into Erikson's last two developmental tasks: Middle Adulthood Generativity vs. Stagnation, and Late Adulthood Integrity vs. Despair. It's important to maintain ambition as part of the story, but not to an extreme, understand who we are and where we fit into a broader sense of purpose and meaning, and at the same time enjoy ourselves along the way."

            "article_content": "Image: Cottonbro studio / Pexels\n\nThe convergence of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, as demonstrated by the meteoric rise of meme tokens like Pepe Coin, is ushering in a new era of decentralized computing that promises to democratize access to advanced machine learning capabilities. This revolutionary combination is not just changing how AI models are trained and deployed \u2013 it's fundamentally transforming the economic landscape of technological innovation.\n\nAs we examine this technological synergy more closely, it becomes clear how decentralized systems are reshaping the traditional power structures in AI development.\n\nThe Foundation of Decentralized AI\n\nTech giants with vast computing resources and proprietary datasets have long dominated traditional AI development. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have maintained a virtual monopoly on advanced AI capabilities, creating a significant barrier to entry for smaller players and independent researchers. However, the introduction of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency incentives is rapidly changing this paradigm.\n\nDecentralized machine learning platforms leverage blockchain's distributed nature to create vast networks of computing power. These networks function like a global supercomputer, where participants can contribute their unused computing resources in exchange for cryptocurrency tokens. This model not only makes AI development more accessible but also more efficient and cost-effective.\n\nThe Economic Incentive Model\n\nThe brilliance of combining cryptocurrency with decentralized AI lies in its economic incentive structure. Participants in these networks are rewarded with native tokens for contributing resources, whether that's computing power, data, or AI models. This creates a positive feedback loop where:\n\nContributors are incentivized to provide more resources to the network Developers gain access to affordable computing power and datasets Users benefit from increasingly sophisticated AI services The overall ecosystem grows in value as more participants join\n\nNetwork participants can earn tokens by providing various resources:\n\nComputing power for training AI models\n\nStorage space for distributed datasets\n\nHigh-quality data for training purposes\n\nValidated AI models ready for deployment\n\nVerification services for ensuring data quality\n\nTechnical Infrastructure and Implementation\n\nThe technical architecture of these platforms typically consists of several key components. Smart contracts manage the distribution of computational tasks and token rewards, ensuring transparent and automatic execution of agreements between parties. Distributed storage solutions like IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) handle the massive datasets required for AI training, while blockchain networks maintain an immutable record of transactions and model provenance.\n\nFederated learning techniques are often employed to train AI models across distributed networks without centralizing sensitive data. This approach allows multiple parties to contribute to model development while maintaining data privacy and reducing bandwidth requirements.\n\nChallenges and Future Developments\n\nDespite the promising potential, decentralized AI platforms face several challenges that need to be addressed for widespread adoption:\n\nSecurity concerns remain paramount, as distributed networks must protect against malicious actors while maintaining performance. Platform developers are implementing sophisticated verification mechanisms and reputation systems to ensure network integrity.\n\nScalability presents another significant challenge, as blockchain networks must handle the massive computational requirements of AI training while maintaining reasonable transaction speeds and costs. Layer-2 solutions and improved consensus mechanisms are being developed to address these limitations.\n\nThe regulatory landscape around both cryptocurrency and AI remains uncertain in many jurisdictions, potentially affecting platform development and adoption. Industry leaders are actively engaging with regulators to establish clear frameworks that protect users while fostering innovation.\n\nImpact on the AI Industry\n\nThe rise of decentralized machine learning platforms is democratizing access to AI technology in unprecedented ways. Small businesses and independent researchers can now access computing resources and datasets that were previously available only to large corporations. This democratization is leading to the following:\n\nIncreased diversity in AI development and applications\n\nMore rapid innovation through collaborative development\n\nLower barriers to entry for AI startups\n\nGreater competition in the AI services market\n\nImproved transparency in AI model development\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe future of decentralized AI platforms appears bright, with several emerging trends likely to shape the industry:\n\nEdge computing integration will enable more efficient processing of AI tasks by leveraging distributed computing resources closer to data sources. This will reduce latency and improve real-time applications.\n\nCross-chain interoperability will allow AI resources to be shared across different blockchain networks, creating a more connected and efficient ecosystem. This will enable greater flexibility in resource allocation and token utilization.\n\nAs these platforms mature, we can expect to see increasingly sophisticated applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and scientific research. The combination of blockchain's security and transparency with AI's analytical capabilities creates possibilities for solving complex problems in ways previously not possible.\n\nThe convergence of blockchain and AI through decentralized machine learning platforms represents a significant shift in how we develop and deploy artificial intelligence. By democratizing access to AI resources and creating economic incentives for participation, these platforms are fostering a new era of collaborative innovation that promises to accelerate technological progress while making it more accessible to all."

In September, President Zelensky said 80% of Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure has been destroyed by Russian bombs. Since then, there\u2019s been no let-up in the shelling.\n\nRepair crews have been working under pressure - and under fire - to keep the lights on in the country. Last week, on national Energy Workers' Day, Zelensky thanked those Ukrainians \"working to bring light\u2026and warmth to our homes\".\n\nHe pledged to restore the damaged facilities. \"But all of this is just the superstructure,\" continued the president, \"at the foundation lies the daily heroism of people like you, your colleagues, and the entire energy sector. We are proud of you.\"\n\nAnd Ukraine is coming up with innovative solutions to cope with the onslaught.\n\nOne state-owned company says it\u2019s planning to build a hydroelectric power plant underground, to keep it safe from missiles and drones. Other companies are working on ground-breaking energy storage devices that can also be protected from the air.\n\nBut that takes time. In the short term, President Zelensky has said Ukraine urgently needs 10-12 additional \"Patriot\" air defence systems in order to keep its cities \u2013 and its power grid \u2013 safe from Russian attacks.\n\nSo far, Western countries have promised to provide far less than that."

However, Wall Street decided to kick off the party a bit early.\n\nSince Election Day, the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), benchmark S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth stock-dependent Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) have all ascended to record-closing highs. This is a continuation of the robust gains Wall Street's major indexes enjoyed during Trump's first term. Between Jan. 20, 2017 and Jan. 20, 2021, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite soared 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively.\n\nBut to quote Wall Street's favorite warning: \"Past performance is no guarantee of future results.\"\n\nAlthough stocks thrived with Trump in the Oval Office, there's genuine concern that his desire to implement tariffs on Day One could undermine American businesses and cause the stock market to plunge. Based on what history tell us, this isn't out of the realm of possibilities.\n\nFormer President and President-elect Donald Trump giving remarks. Image source: Official White House Photo by Andrea Hanks.\n\nAnalysis: Trump's prior tariffs had a deleterious effect on U.S. equities\n\nLast month, President-elect Trump laid out his plan to impose a 25% tariff on imports from its direct neighbors, Canada and Mexico, as well as 35% tariff on imported goods from China, the world's No. 2 economy.\n\nThe general purpose of tariffs is to make American-made goods more price-competitive with those being brought in from beyond our borders. They're also designed to encourage multinational businesses to manufacture their goods destined for the U.S. within the confines of our borders.\n\nBut according to an analysis from Liberty Street Economics, which publishes research for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Trump's tariffs have previously had a decisively negative impact on U.S. equities exposed to countries where those tariffs were targeted.\n\nThe four authors of Do Import Tariffs Protect U.S. Firms? make it a point to distinguish between the impacts of tariffs on outputs versus inputs. An output tariff is an added cost placed on the final price of a good, such as a car imported into the country. Meanwhile, an input tariff would affect the cost of producing a final good (e.g., higher costs on imported steel). The authors note that higher input tariffs make it difficult for U.S. manufacturers to compete on price with foreign businesses.\n\nThe authors also examined the stock market returns of all publicly traded U.S. companies on the day Trump announced tariffs in 2018 and 2019. They found a clear negative shift in equity prices on the days tariffs were announced, with this effect being most pronounced on businesses that were exposed to China.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Complex data center workloads like training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence (AI) applications would take a very long time if powered only by central processing units (CPUs). To that end, specialized semiconductors are used to speed up computationally intensive AI tasks.\n\nIn that semiconductor vertical, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs) have emerged as the industry standard. In fact, the company has between 80% and 95% market share in AI accelerators, according to analysts. But Nvidia shareholders recently got some worrisome news from rival Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO).\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nNvidia shareholders just got some bad news from Broadcom\n\nBroadcom sells a range of semiconductor products, including combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips in Apple and Samsung smartphones, as well as networking chips in Arista switches. But Wall Street is particularly fascinated by its leadership in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs.) ASICs are chips purpose-built for specific use cases like accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\n\nAnalysts estimate Broadcom has approximately 60% market share in custom AI chips due to its relationships with three hyperscalers, a term that refers to companies with vast data center footprints. While Broadcom has not identified its hyperscale customers, analysts generally believe they are Google parent Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and TikTok parent ByteDance.\n\nBroadcom estimates revenue from its three existing hyperscale customers will range from $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027, up from $12.2 billion in 2024. In other words, the company anticipates that custom AI chip sales will increase at least 70% annually in the next three years, but perhaps as quickly as 95% annually.\n\nThat is disappointing for Nvidia shareholders because it means Broadcom will likely gain market share in AI accelerators. In fact, analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that ASICs will account for 13% of AI accelerator sales in 2027, up from 11% in 2024. They also think that figure could hit 15% in 2030. But there is more bad news for Nvidia shareholders.\n\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan told analysts on the fourth-quarter earnings call that Broadcom has selected two new hyperscalers that are likely to be revenue-generating customers by 2027. That means revenue from custom AI chips could actually grow faster than 95% annually in the next few years. Importantly, while Broadcom did not identify the customers, analysts believe they are Apple and ChatGPT creator OpenAI.\n\nA semiconductor underlit by gold light, with glowing letters AI on its face.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia shareholders still have good reason to be optimistic\n\nI mentioned that Broadcom selected two additional hyperscalers as potential customers. CEO Hock Tan himself used that word because Broadcom will not develop ASICs for small companies, nor would small companies have an interest in using custom AI chips.\n\nThere are two reasons for that. First, designing ASICs is expensive, so the customer must have a data center footprint large enough to warrant the expense. Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar recently told CNBC that each chip costs about $500 million to design, so it would not be financially sensible to work with clients that can only order a few thousand. Instead, orders must be in the range of 250,000 to 500,000 units.\n\nSecond, custom chips are less flexible because they are designed for specific workloads and lack supporting software development tools. Nvidia offers a robust ecosystem of code libraries and pretrained models that streamline GPU application development. No such tools exist for ASICs. That means deploying custom chips requires a high degree of technical expertise, which means Broadcom's customer base is limited.\n\nAdditionally, companies that experiment with ASICs may ultimately decide the costs outweigh the benefits. Antoine Chkaiban at New Street Research says only two companies have deployed custom AI silicon at scale: Google and Amazon. So Nvidia is well positioned to maintain its leadership in AI accelerators. Bank of America analysts estimate it will capture 75% market share in 2030, down only slightly from 80% in 2024.\n\nLooking ahead, Wall Street thinks Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase at 34% annually through fiscal 2027, which ends in January 2027. That consensus makes the current valuation of 53 times adjusted earnings look very reasonable. Prospective investors can buy a few shares with confidence, and current shareholders have good reason to optimistic going forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "article_content": "Although Russia has managed to avoid an economic collapse, its war with Ukraine and military involvement in Syria have negatively affected its economy.\n\nRussia\u2019s military intervention in Syria since 2015 has allowed it to assert its power, creating a misleading perception of Russia\u2019s military might. In contrast, Ukraine has dispelled that illusion and significantly injured its invaders.\n\nRussia\u2019s decade-long involvement in Syria has failed, much like its invasion of Ukraine. Although Russia\u2019s stature has declined, it will keep up the pretense.\n\nNow that the rebels have ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, they have also exposed Russia\u2019s fragility and difficulty supporting its client states such as neighboring Belarus. This turn of events will undoubtedly change the geopolitical landscape, particularly affecting Iran, which is providing Russia with drones. That bodes well for Israel.\n\nDuring the Arab Spring in 2011, people rose up and ousted the leaders of Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen. However, Russia protected Syria, enabling Assad to remain in power. Russia has also benefited, gaining a foothold in the Middle East and establishing two military bases. The country has invested heavily in Syria by deploying troops, conducting airstrikes and providing economic support \u2014 money down the tubes. Russia has given refuge to Assad, and even Russia\u2019s state-controlled media can\u2019t hide that dark reality.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama has described Russia as little more than a large gas station with nuclear weapons, suggesting that its influence is mainly regional \u2014 thinking with which President Joe Biden agrees.\n\nUkraine has underscored this critique by stating that Russia cannot effectively fight on two fronts and that Ukraine\u2019s military efforts have significantly weakened Russia\u2019s capacity to exert international influence. This experience serves as a warning to other countries that they cannot rely on Russia. To engage in the conflict with Ukraine, Russia must dedicate all of its workforce and weaponry.\n\nMoreover, Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy symbolize the quest for sovereignty and the defense of democracy, aligning themselves with the rebels who overthrew Assad and, by extension, opposed Russia\u2019s presence in Syria. At the same time, Ukraine highlights Russia\u2019s alleged war crimes, drawing parallels to its actions in Syria, particularly the indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians.\n\nKyiv portrays itself as the bulwark against Russian imperialism and the \u201ciron curtain\u201d \u2014 an ironic label \u2014 to prevent further aggression. Any Russian notion that it could remake the Soviet Union and relive its \u201cglory days\u201d is an illusion: Ukraine and Syria are perfect illustrations.\n\nRussia is a declining power struggling to maintain its ambitions beyond its borders.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the world welcomed Russia into the international fold. But Vladimir Putin\u2019s rise to power in 2000 has gradually reversed progress to the point where his regime has imprisoned more political prisoners than Leonid Brezhnev in the 1970s.\n\n\u201cToday, Russia respects neither borders nor human rights. There are no free media or honest elections,\u201d said Poland\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Radek Sikorski, at a December meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\n\u201cIt proved too difficult to emerge from their own political culture. Russia\u2019s rulers chose the path of aggressive, repressive kleptocracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not taken in by your lies, and we know what you are doing. You are trying to rebuild the Russian empire. We will not let you. We will resist you every inch of the way. You are successful in destroying Ukraine. But you are also destroying the future of your own country.\u201d\n\nAlthough Russia has managed to avoid an economic collapse, its war with Ukraine and military involvement in Syria have negatively affected its economy. The country\u2019s national wealth supports its war efforts \u2014 rather than building its economy.\n\nAdditionally, Western nations and their allies have imposed extensive sanctions on Russia\u2019s banking, energy and military industries, restricting its ability to obtain essential technologies.\n\nHistorically, Russia\u2019s energy exports have provided economic muscle. However, Europe, which has relied on Russian oil and gas, is now imposing a boycott on these resources. While it directs some of this energy to China and India, Russia sells it at discounted prices. Consequently, Russia is experiencing inflation and a shortage of goods.\n\nRussia has drained its coffers, and Assad\u2019s fall has further damaged its reputation. Indeed, the emperor has no clothes \u2014 a cautionary tale for other aligned leaders in Iran, North Korea and Belarus.\n\nKen Silverstein has covered energy and the environment for years.

            "article_content": "The more powerful the PC, the more heat it typically generates. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so impressive to see a silent mini gaming PC such as this new Cirrus7 machine, which has absolutely no fans. Cirrus7, a specialist German PC manufacturer, has been shipping the passively cooled Cirrus7 Incus since 2019, but it\u2019s now just announced a refresh to its lineup, with new CPUs from Intel and AMD from which to choose, including the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X.\n\nAs our Geekom AX8 Pro review showed, keeping a high-spec PC cool in such a small space can be tricky, usually relying on high-spinning fans to get the job done. The Cirrus 7 Incus, meanwhile, instead uses a special aluminum case to spread the heat away from the Intel or AMD CPU in use, keeping the PC silent in the process.\n\nThis highly powerful mini PC is available in several different configurations, but the new refresh allows you to choose between 14th-gen Intel Raptor Lake CPUs, such as the Intel Core i9 14900T, or brand-new AMD Ryzen 9000 series CPUs, such as the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X. The build itself uses a custom Mini-STX motherboard, with three different case designs that use metal cooling fins to help remove the heat.\n\nYou can choose your own storage, RAM, and built-in wireless connection options, as well as your preferred operating system. For a gaming build, a good configuration would be to choose an AM5 CPU such as the AMD Ryzen 7 8700G, which uses the same AMD Radeon 780M integrated GPU found in a gaming handheld such as the Asus ROG Ally X, which is capable of handling 1080p gameplay at modest settings.\n\nCombine that with 16GB RAM and a good-sized 1TB M.2 SSD for storage, using the bigger extended cooling case design, and this Cirrus 7 Incus PC will cost nearly $1,100. While that might seem expensive, this mini PC\u2019s whole design is focused on having zero fans, meaning that it\u2019s completely silent, or as close to silent as any electronic device can be.\n\nIf you\u2019re sick of fan noise ruining the immersion during your gameplay sessions, a totally fanless, passively cooled setup such as this Cirrus7 Incus machine would be a good alternative. You can check out this mini PC for yourself by visiting the Cirrus7 website using this link here, where you can test out building your own custom configuration. The German manufacturer does ship internationally, but you\u2019ll need to confirm with the company first about shipping outside of the EU.\n\nThis looks to be a great fanless mini PC, but if you\u2019re looking for more gaming power, check out our best mini gaming PC guide, where we take you through a number of options, some of which even include full-size graphics cards."

He never thought that he'd be in the feds,\" prison expert Larry Levine, founder of Wall Street Prison Consultants, told The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"He's acclimating himself to his new surroundings. His lawyers are thanking God he's in New York, and they don't have to travel to Pennsylvania to visit him. So, he's just adjusting to where he's at.\n\n\"He'll be there for a week or so, maybe two weeks. Then maybe in a month, they'll move him where Diddy is.\n\n\"But [Diddy] can handle his s**t.

That's a given.\"\n\nYou're talking old, old, million old money. Now he can have cheese crackers, and maybe a bottle of a plastic bottle of soda. Larry Levine\n\nLevine, who served 10 years in federal prison on racketeering, securities fraud, obstruction of justice, and narcotics trafficking charges, said Mangione is in a situation unlike anything he's experienced before.\n\nThe Metropolitan Detention Center is plagued with inmate death and violence, rodents, raw sewage, understaffing, and a deteriorating infrastructure.\n\nChilling moment CEO \u2018assassin\u2019 Luigi Mangione tells classmates to \u2018challenge the world\u2019 in valedictorian speech\n\nCameron Lindsay, a former warden at the infamous federal building, told The New York Times in 2019 that the site is \"one of the most trouble, if not the most troubled facility in the Bureau of Prisons.\"\n\n'OLD MONEY' WEALTH\n\nMangione was born to a prominent, well-established Italian-American family in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nNicholas Mangione Sr., the family patriarch and the young Mangione's grandfather, left his 10 kids and 37 grandchildren an extensive multi-million dollar real estate portfolio, including country clubs, nursing homes, and a radio station.\n\nLuigi Mangione came from a privileged upbringing, attending the prestigious high school Gilman School in Baltimore, where tuition is currently $37,690 per year.\n\nHe was on the wrestling and soccer teams and was valedictorian of his graduating class of 2016.\n\nAfter high school, he continued his academic success, attending the University of Pennsylvania for his undergraduate and graduate studies.\n\nThen, after college, Mangione landed several internships with tech companies and found a job as a software engineer at TrueCar, an online marketplace based in Santa Monica, California.\n\nThe perks of his job allowed Mangione to work remotely, and he eventually found himself living in a shared space in a high-rise apartment in Honolulu, Hawaii, where he paid about $2,000 per month.\n\nDuring a trip to Thailand in April, Mangione boasted to another traveler that he was making \"lawyer money\" as a coder for TrueCar and claimed to have $6 million in his bank account thanks to his wealthy family, according to TMZ.\n\n10 Mangione, who came from a privileged upbringing, will experience a 'different life, different world' while in federal lockup, a prison expert said Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\n10 Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was executed outside the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan on the morning of December 4 Credit: AFP\n\n10 Police place bullet casing markers outside of a Hilton hotel where Brian Thompson was fatally shot Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\n'DIFFERENT LIFE, DIFFERENT WORLD'\n\nHowever, Mangione's elite lifestyle was upended when he was arrested on December 9 at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 280 miles west of where he allegedly assassinated the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare.\n\n\"You're talking old, old million, old money,\" Levine told The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"Now he can have cheese crackers and maybe a bottle of a plastic bottle of soda.\n\n\"He'll buy a honey bun. It's like all knock-offs, too. They don't sell the real s**t in the feds.\n\n\"What is it called, Mrs. Freshly - I never heard of it until I went in. I saw it once at a $.99 store.\n\n\"So, he'll be eating like off-brand, knock-off convenience, snacks, and s**t when he finally gets to get that.\"\n\nLevine added, \"So, different life, different world, you know. It's not like he's in the state where you can buy your own TV set.\n\n\"He's gonna have to deal with inmates, and he's not gonna be making the decisions.\n\n\"So yeah, that's a mindf**k.\"\n\n'LIFE BEHIND BARS'\n\nLevine compared Mangione's living conditions in the Metropolitan Detention Center to \"living in your bathroom.\"\n\n\"You know, if he's living in a cell like Diddy was for a while, you know how big those cells are? Picture living in your bathroom with no TV, no computer as well,\" Levine said.\n\n\"That's what his cell life will be like. You got nothing to read.\n\n\"Here's your Bible, though. So, he'll be reading the Bible, he'll be getting discovery, but what real discovery is there.\n\n\"He didn't commit a sophisticated crime. So, they'll give him discovery, 'We found this, and we found that this were his movements,' for the next whatever period of time.\n\n\"The guy already admitted that he did it, so you know what kind of big investigation do you need on that.\"\n\n10 The Metropolitan Detention Center is also where disgraced music mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs is being held while he awaits trial Credit: Reuters\n\n10 Prison consultant Larry Levine believes Mangione is 'scared' and 'never expected to be in the feds' Credit: AP:Associated Press\n\n10 Surveillance video captured the moment a masked, hooded gunman assassinated Brian Thompson as he arrived at the Hilton hotel for an investor conference Credit: AP\n\n'HUMAN PING-PONG BALL'\n\nOn Monday, Mangione pleaded not guilty to 11 state criminal counts, including a first-degree murder that brands him as a terrorist.\n\nA grinning Mangione appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court, where his attorney raised issues with the New York City Police Department's \"staged\" perp walk of her client.\n\n\"He's a young man, and he's being treated like a human ping-pong ball by two warring jurisdictions here,\" defense attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo argued.\n\n\"They're treating him like a human spectacle.\"\n\nAgnifilo questions Mayor Eric Adam's presence at the December 19 perp walk, where dozens of heavily armed police officers and FBI officials waited for Mangione to arrive at a heliport near Wall Street.\n\n\"What was the New York City mayor doing at this press conference - that is utterly political,\" the attorney added.\n\n\"The New York City mayor should know more than anyone the presumption of innocence.\"\n\nDespite her concerns, Judge Gregory Carro assured Agnifilo that Mangione would receive a fair trial, saying, \"We will carefully select a jury.\"\n\nMangione's next court date in state court is scheduled for February 21.\n\nBefore then, he is expected to appear in federal court on January 18."

            "article_content": "Over the last decade or so, quantum computing has become the talk of computer town. Their potential to solve complex problems much faster than classical computers is an intriguing proposition that could benefit, if not transform, several industries.\n\nThe working of a quantum computer is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, an area of physics that deals with the smallest particles in the universe.\n\nPhysicist Richard Feynman proposed the idea of developing a computer to simulate quantum systems in 1982. He discussed the idea of a universal computer that could simulate all physics \u2014 both quantum and classical. Researchers realised classical computers, the computers of today, would struggle with the complexity of quantum systems and thus the idea of a quantum computer was born.\n\nSince then, scientists have made significant progress in quantum computing.\n\nBasics of quantum computing\n\nClassical computers work on the principles of classical physics. Their fundamental computing unit is the bit: each bit represents one piece of information with two possible values, 0 or 1. It is possible to represent all types of information as a combination of 0s and 1s using the binary system.\n\nQuantum computers rely on quantum bits or qubits to perform computations. Unlike classical bits, qubits can exist in the states 0, 1 or in a state that\u2019s partly 0 and partly 1. In this context, state refers to all the possible values the qubit can have.\n\nThe ability of qubits to be in two states is known as superposition. Superposition is one of two fundamental principles that animate quantum computers.\n\nImagine a spinning coin. While the coin is spinning, it can be both heads or tails, and it isn\u2019t until the coin collapses that you can see which it is. A qubit is like a spinning coin that holds both values simultaneously.\n\nWhen a qubit is measured, it collapses to one of the values, 0 or 1. This means while a classical bit holds one unit of information, a qubit can hold two. Because of this quantum computers can perform multiple computations simultaneously, with the measurement revealing one of the possible outcomes of the computations.\n\nThe second fundamental principle upon which quantum computers are based is called entanglement. This phenomenon allows qubits to be intrinsically linked no matter how far apart they physically are. Albert Einstein famously called it \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d.\n\nSo measuring the state of one of the qubits could immediately yield information about the state of the other. Say you have a pair of gloves. Each glove is put in a separate box and sent to different locations, and we don\u2019t know which box has which. But once a box is opened to reveal the left glove, we instantly know the other box has the right glove.\n\nThe instantaneous correlation between qubits allows shared information to be processed simultaneously, speeding up computations that would take far longer with classical computers.\n\nSuperposition and entanglement can\u2019t be described by classical theories of physics. They are exclusive to quantum mechanics \u2014 and central to the potential that quantum computers have to offer.\n\nSignificant milestones\n\nQuantum computers are technologically superior but this doesn\u2019t automatically mean they will be better than classical computers at different tasks.\n\nOver the years, experts have developed and honed specific tasks that prove quantum computers are capable of greater feats, and also show how.\n\nIn 1994, Bell Labs computer scientist Peter Shor created the famous Shor\u2019s algorithm. The algorithm could factorise (or find the factors of) large numbers in moments rather than the millions of years required by classical computers.\n\nThis has major implications for data security. Current methods to secure data involve locking the data and hiding the key to unlock it in the solution of a difficult mathematical problem.\n\nLarge-number factorisation is one such problem and classical computers require enormous amounts of resources to solve it. But using Shor\u2019s algorithm, a quantum computer could quickly solve the problem and open the locks.\n\nThe state of quantum computing came a long way in the next 25 years. In 2019, for example, IBM unveiled the world\u2019s first circuit-based commercial quantum computer Q System One. Circuit-based designs are believed to be the most versatile for general quantum-computing applications.\n\nQ System One uses quantum circuits composed of quantum gates that manipulate qubits, analogous to how classical computers use logic gates.\n\nIn the same year, researchers at Google reported in a paper in Nature that their 53-qubit \u2018Sycamore\u2019 processor had achieved quantum supremacy.\n\nA quantum computer achieves quantum supremacy when it can solve a problem that would take classical computers an unreasonable amount of time. The paper claimed Sycamore completed a task in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer 10,000 years.\n\nEarlier this month, in fact, Google unveiled a quantum chip called Willow, purportedly the world\u2019s first quantum processor in which error-corrected qubits improve as they scale.\n\nQuantum states are easily prone to errors due to interactions with the environment. Quantum computers need error correction to hold information long enough to perform useful calculations with them.\n\nWillow, Google has said, can finish a standard test in five minutes whereas the same calculation would take today\u2019s best supercomputers 10 trillion trillion years.\n\nPresent limitations\n\nThe advancements are flying thick and fast but there are still many significant challenges to overcome before quantum computers can become (relatively) common.\n\nThe chief concern is that building quantum computers remains expensive and complex. Keeping many qubits stable is also difficult because of error rates and decoherence (when a qubit loses superposition because of noise from its surroundings).\n\nThe problems for which we really need quantum computers \u2014 like discovering new drugs or cracking mysteries in astronomy \u2014 also require millions of qubits.\n\nAll said, their potential to be useful is clear. This is why India launched the National Quantum Mission in 2023. The government has set aside \u20b96,000 crore for the mission to be spent over eight years, among other things to develop quantum computers.\n\nTejasri Gururaj is a freelance science writer and journalist with a master\u2019s degree in physics"

Found in the Batagaika crater, the ancient creature offers valuable insights into prehistoric life, while climate change accelerates the permafrost's retreat.\n\nMeanwhile, on a different frontier of technology, South Korean scientists have unveiled an 'Iron Man' inspired exoskeleton robot. This lightweight, wearable device aids paraplegics by locking onto the user's body, helping them navigate stairs and obstacles, marking a leap forward in assistive technology.\n\nIn the realm of space exploration, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) has attracted 30 companies for a pioneering initiative to establish home-grown satellite constellations. This effort aims to bolster India's defense and infrastructure capabilities by reducing dependency on foreign data.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"
