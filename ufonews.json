This is similar to The Manhattan Project; this is the atomic weapon on steroids,\u201d says Jay Stratton, former director of the U.S. government\u2019s UAP task force.\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure is helmed by filmmaker Dan Farah and will premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival in the Paramount Theatre in March. The film\u2019s producers are currently in talks to get the movie commercial distribution."

Called Perplexity Assistant, the AI helper is available through the Perplexity app on the Google Play Store and is supported in 15 languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Hindi.\n\nWhile we haven\u2019t had a chance to try out the new Perplexity Assistant, the company claims it can perform multi-app actions, similar to Gemini\u2019s recently acquired chaining actions that Google first demonstrated on the Galaxy S25 series.\n\nHere are a few more examples of what Perplexity Assistant can do. We can\u2019t wait to see how you use it. pic.twitter.com/F7ibSFfrgq Get it here: https://t.co/H4J9cr68So \u2014 Perplexity (@perplexity_ai) January 23, 2025\n\nFor example, you can ask the AI to \u201cplay that song at the end of Interstellar.\u201d It will research the song\u2019s name on the web and open a music app on your phone to play it.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure how this would function, but we\u2019re guessing you\u2019ll have to grant Perplexity some permissions to open and execute commands on your apps. Gemini uses extensions to facilitate chaining actions, but Perplexity hasn\u2019t really elaborated on how its AI will facilitate multi-app actions on Android phones.\n\nPerplexity Assistant is also multimodal, which means it can answer questions based on voice commands and understand multiple types of data, such as text, images, audio, and video. \u201cYou can tell it to turn on the camera and ask about what you see in front of you or on your screen,\u201d the company explains.\n\nThe company lists Perplexity Assistant\u2019s other capabilities as follows: \u201cYou can book dinner, find a forgotten song, call a ride, draft emails, set reminders, and more.\u201d\n\nLooks like we\u2019ll have to give Perplexity Assistant a go and see how it compares to Gemini.\n\nYou might like"

            "article_content": "A s a health journalist, I know how difficult it can be to find accurate health information online. In the age of AI-powered search engines, you never quite know if the answers served up to you at the top of the page are from legitimate medical sources or some woo-woo wellness site that hasn't been touched in years. Even in my personal life, it can be tricky to find resources about the conditions I may face as a woman\u2014and I know I'm not alone in that experience.\n\nFrom menstruation to fertility, and yes, even to menopause, there's still so much mystery surrounding women's health. Case in point: More than 1 million Americans go through menopause each year, but studies find that 80 percent of those people have limited knowledge about menopause, never learned about it in school, or have a negative attitude toward the life phase altogether. No wonder so many of us are too embarrassed to bring up our concerns at the OB/GYN, which can lead to gaps in quality care.\n\nThis is where AI\u2014and personalized health advice in the form of an app\u2014can be useful. Meet Roon, an app that partners world-class healthcare providers with artificial intelligence to bridge the divide between people and reliable health information. Recently, Roon launched Roon Menopause\u2014a platform that serves as a digital library for all the menopause questions you may have, from how to tame a hot flash to navigating hormone therapy, with answers from real-life medical experts.\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with Roon CEO and co-founder Vikram Bhaskaran to learn more about the launch. Here's what to expect once you hit download on iOS.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nFirst, what is Roon?\n\nRoon is an app that puts free, expert-driven resources on several health conditions at your fingertips. Conditions featured on the app include ALS, dementia, endometriosis, fertility, glioblastoma, PCOS, and now, menopause. The app was born when Bhaskaran, a former tech developer with Pinterest, became a caregiver for his father with ALS and noticed a disturbing lack of information about the illness online.\n\n\"Like most caregivers on the planet, I spent thousands of hours on Dr. Google, Facebook groups, Instagram, and TikTok to try to find medically vetted information,\" Bhaskaran says. \"When it comes to health, it sometimes feels like we are still in the dark ages.\" But between how long it takes to see a specialist, plus providers only spending about 18 minutes on average with patients per appointment, Bhaskaran says it only makes sense that we turn to the Internet for help.\n\nUsing his tech-savvy and appreciation for beautiful, algorithm-driven apps like Pinterest, Bhaskaran teamed up with his co-founder Rohan Ramakrishna, MD, a neurosurgeon at Weill Cornell, engineers, and designers to develop Roon, which houses hundreds of pre-recorded videos of healthcare providers answering the top questions they get asked every day.\n\nOn top of that, users can also take advantage of the \"ask a question\" search tool to find answers, all with the help of AI technology. (More on this below.)\n\nHow Roon uses AI to provide health information\n\nInstead of gathering answers from all over the Internet like other AI-powered search engines, Roon's \"ask a question\" AI tool only pulls quotes from the pre-recorded content that exists within the app. This ensures you're getting accurate and reliable answers straight from a professional each time you search, and not some unknown source.\n\nOnce your question has been answered, the AI tool auto-populates related questions, which is how the personalization takes shape. \"The more you use it, the more we learn about you so we can ultimately become your personalized guide for health,\" says Bhaskaran. Plus, if you add your age and gender identity, \"we can also personalize content based on where you are in your journey,\" he adds. So, for example, if you're a 40-year-old female who's trying to get pregnant, it might suggest you watch perimenopause or fertility content.\n\nWhile this service doesn't replace the need for real visits with your healthcare provider, it could help those with a lack of access to quality care or insufficient health insurance feel more empowered\u2014and less confused\u2014about their well-being. \"In the age of AI-generated content, we're going the opposite way, which is there's nothing more human than a doctor looking into a camera answering your question when you're going through a hard journey,\" Bhaskaran adds.\n\nOther Roon Menopause features\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about Roon Menopause is its user-friendliness. No matter your level of tech skill, the simple design makes it fairly easy to sift through each tab and section. You can start searching for information based on the type of expert you want to hear from (like a reproductive endocrinologist, OB/GYN, or holistic practitioner), the symptoms you're experiencing (like vaginal dryness, fatigue, or insomnia), co-occurring conditions you may have (like osteoporosis or depression), or other topics, like treatments, diagnosis, causes, and more.\n\nOnce you find a topic you're interested in, you can watch short videos or read written responses from a variety of providers, who Bhaskaran says are not only heavily vetted before joining the app, but are also great communicators with good bedside manner IRL. Some notable names include Mindy Goldman, MD, the chief clinical officer at MIDI Health, Corrine Menn, MD, with Alloy Women's Health, and Rajita Patil, MD, a menopause specialist at UCLA Health, among others.\n\nFrom there, the AI feature will suggest other topics or questions you might ask. Consider it a personal search engine and doctor-filled social feed all in one.\n\nAnd we're not just talking about physical health here: Roon Menopause also spans the mental, emotional, and sexual wellness aspects of menopause. So you may explore topics like \"how to comfortably have sex with vaginal dryness,\" \"how to talk to your partner about menopause,\" or \"how to start your fertility treatment if you're also in perimenopause.\" It also offers tips for optimal nutrition, exercise, holistic vs. traditional medicine practices, and specific treatment options for each menopause symptom you're facing.\n\nHere's more of a breakdown of the features:\n\nExpert network of over 60 licensed healthcare providers\n\nThousands of pre-recorded Q&A videos and written content\n\nApproximately 1,300 answered questions\n\nOver 100 related subtopics\n\nInstant answers through an AI-powered search tool\n\nAdvice from people with lived experience\n\nMultiple expert perspectives on highly debated treatment options (such as hormone therapy)\n\nCulturally sensitive and trauma-informed content\n\nNext-step advice for receiving care\n\nUltimately, Bhaskaran says this service is a safe place to ask the hard questions or ones you may be too uncomfortable to ask your provider about. \"This is just the beginning of how we'll support women across their lifetime health journeys through expert guidance,\" he adds.\n\nYes, it's personal, but is your data safe?\n\nWithin the last few years, some people have shied away from using period tracking apps for fear that their reproductive health information will be shared and sold to third parties or that it would be used against them at healthcare facilities or in legal proceedings. This is because period trackers can not only log menstruation, but also missed periods, miscarriages, and infertility.\n\nBut rest assured that with Roon, the private details you share about your reproductive health stay within the app, and are only used to further optimize your experience, says Bhaskaran. Data is stored locally and never shared with third parties.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThere's nothing more comforting than having a trusted healthcare provider's advice by your side\u2014especially during a time like menopause. Whether you're already in it, about to start, or know a loved one currently going through the life phase, apps like Roon Menopause\u2014which combines AI with medically sound information\u2014can cut through the noise, misinformation, or even medical gaslighting you may face, both online and in person.\n\nAdditional Sources + Well+Good articles reference scientific, reliable, recent, robust studies to back up the information we share.

            "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nAs of a few days ago, only the nerdiest of nerds (I say this as one) had ever heard of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI subsidiary of the equally evocatively named High-Flyer Capital Management, a quantitative analysis (or quant) firm that initially launched in 2015.\n\nYet within the last few days, it\u2019s been arguably the most discussed company in Silicon Valley. That\u2019s largely thanks to the release of DeepSeek-R1, a new large language model (LLM) that performs \u201creasoning\u201d similar to OpenAI\u2019s current best-available model o1 \u2014 taking multiple seconds or minutes to answer hard questions and solve complex problems as it reflects on its own analysis in a step-by-step, or \u201cchain of thought\u201d fashion.\n\nNot only that, but DeepSeek-R1 scored as high as or higher than OpenAI\u2019s o1 on a variety of third-party benchmarks (tests to measure AI performance at answering questions on various subjects), and was reportedly trained at a fraction of the cost (reportedly around $5 million), with far fewer graphics processing units (GPU) that are under a strict embargo imposed by the U.S., OpenAI\u2019s home turf.\n\nBut unlike o1, which is available only to paying ChatGPT subscribers of the Plus tier ($20 per month) and more expensive tiers (such as Pro at $200 per month), DeepSeek-R1 was released as a fully open-source model, which also explains why it has quickly rocketed up the charts of AI code sharing community Hugging Face\u2019s most downloaded and active models.\n\nAlso, thanks to the fact that it is fully open-source, people have already fine-tuned and trained many variations of the model for different task-specific purposes, such as making it small enough to run on a mobile device, or combining it with other open-source models. Even if you want to use it for development purposes, DeepSeek\u2019s API costs are more than 90% lower than the equivalent o1 model from OpenAI.\n\nMost impressively of all, you don\u2019t even need to be a software engineer to use it: DeepSeek has a free website and mobile app even for U.S. users with an R1-powered chatbot interface very similar to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Except, once again, DeepSeek undercut or \u201cmogged\u201d OpenAI by connecting this powerful reasoning model to web search \u2014 something OpenAI hasn\u2019t yet done (web search is only available on the less powerful GPT family of models at present).\n\nAn open-and-shut irony\n\nThere\u2019s a pretty delicious, or maybe disconcerting irony to this, given OpenAI\u2019s founding goals to democratize AI for the masses. As Nvidia senior research manager Jim Fan put it on X: \u201cWe are living in a timeline where a non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive \u2014 truly open, frontier research that empowers all. It makes no sense. The most entertaining outcome is the most likely.\u201d\n\nOr as X user @SuspendedRobot put it, referencing reports that DeepSeek appears to have been trained on question-answer outputs and other data generated by ChatGPT: \u201cOpenAI stole from the whole internet to make itself richer, DeepSeek stole from them and give it back to the masses for free I think there is a certain british folktale about this\u201d\n\nMeta in crisis as open-source Llama falls behind?\n\nBut Fan isn\u2019t the only one to sit up and take note of DeepSeek\u2019s success. The open-source availability of DeepSeek-R1, its high performance, and the fact that it seemingly \u201ccame out of nowhere\u201d to challenge the former leader of generative AI, has sent shockwaves throughout Silicon Valley and far beyond, based on my conversations with and readings of various engineers, thinkers and leaders. If not \u201ceveryone\u201d is freaking out about it as my hyperbolic headline suggests, it\u2019s certainly the talk of the town in tech and business circles.\n\nA message posted to Blind, the app for sharing anonymous gossip in Silicon Valley, has been making the rounds suggesting Meta is in crisis over the success of DeepSeek because of how quickly it surpassed Meta\u2019s own efforts to be the king of open-source AI with its Llama models.\n\n\u2018This changes the whole game\u2019\n\nX user @tphuang wrote compellingly: \u201cDeepSeek has commoditized AI outside of very top-end. Lightbulb moment for me in 1st photo. R1 is so much cheaper than US labor cost that many jobs will get automated away over next 5 yrs,\u201d later noting why DeepSeek\u2019s R1 is more enticing to users than even OpenAI\u2019s o1:\n\n\u201c3 huge issues w/ o1:\n\n1) too slow\n\n2) too expensive\n\n3) lack of control for end user/reliance on OpenAI\n\nR1 solves all of them. A company can buy their own Nvidia GPUs, run these models. Don\u2019t have to worry about additional costs or slow/unresponsive OpenAI servers\u201d\n\n@tphaung also posed a compelling analogy as a question: \u201cWill DeepSeek be to LLM what Android became to OS world?\u201d\n\nWeb entrepreneur Arnaud Bertrand didn\u2019t mince words about the startling implications of DeepSeek\u2019s success either, writing on X: \u201cThere\u2019s no overstating how profoundly this changes the whole game. And not only with regards to AI, it\u2019s also a massive indictment of the US\u2019s misguided attempt to stop China\u2019s technological development, without which Deepseek may not have been possible (as the saying goes, necessity is the mother of inventions).\u201d\n\nThe censorship issue\n\nHowever, others have sounded cautionary notes on DeepSeek\u2019s rapid rise, arguing that as a startup operated out of China, it is necessarily subject to that country\u2019s laws and content censorship requirements.\n\nIndeed, in my own usage of DeepSeek on the iOS app here in the U.S. I found it would not answer questions about Tiananmen Square, the site of the 1989 pro-democracy student protests and uprising, and subsequent violent crackdown by the Chinese military, which resulted in at least 200, possibly thousands of deaths, earning it the nickname \u201cTiananmen Square Massacre\u201d in Western media outlets.\n\nBen Hylak, a former Apple human interface designer and cofounder of AI product analytics platform Dawn, posted on X how asking about this subject caused DeepSeek-R1 to enter a circuitous loop.\n\nAs a member of the press itself, I of course take freedom of speech and expression extremely seriously and it is one of the most fundamental, inarguable causes I champion.\n\nYet I would be remiss not to note that OpenAI\u2019s models and products including ChatGPT also refuse to answer a whole range of questions about even innocuous content \u2014 especially pertaining to human sexuality and erotic/adult, NSFW subject matter.\n\nIt\u2019s not an apples-to-apples comparison, of course. And there will be some for whom the resistance to relying on foreign technology makes them skeptical of DeepSeek\u2019s ultimate value and utility. But there\u2019s no denying its performance and low cost.\n\nAnd in a time when 16.5% of all U.S. goods are imported by China, it\u2019s hard for me to caution against using DeepSeek-R1 on the basis of censorship concerns or security risks \u2014 especially when the model code is freely available to download, take offline, use on-device in secure environments, and fine-tune at will.\n\nI definitely detect some existential crisis-thinking about the \u201cfall of the West\u201d and \u201crise of China\u201d motivating some of the animated discussion around DeepSeek, however, and others have already connected it to how U.S. users joined the app Xiaohongshu (aka \u201cLittle Red Book\u201d) when TikTok was briefly banned in this country, only to be amazed at the quality of life in China depicted in the videos shared there. DeepSeek-R1\u2019s arrival occurs in this narrative context \u2014 one in which China appears (and by many metrics is clearly) ascendant while the U.S. appears (and by many metrics, also is) in decline.\n\nThe first but hardly the last Chinese AI model to shake the world\n\nIt also won\u2019t be the last Chinese AI model to threaten the dominance of Silicon Valley giants \u2014 even as they, like OpenAI, raise more money than ever for their ambitions to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI), programs that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\n\nJust yesterday, another Chinese model, from TikTok parent company Bytedance \u2014 called Doubao-1.5-pro \u2014 was released with performance matching OpenAI\u2019s non-reasoning GPT-4o model on third-party benchmarks, but again, at 1/50th the cost.\n\nChinese models have gotten so good, so fast, that even those outside the tech industry are taking note: The Economist magazine just ran a piece on DeepSeek\u2019s success and that of other Chinese AI efforts, and political commentator Matt Bruenig posted on X that: \u201cI have been extensively using Gemini, ChatGPT, and Claude for NLRB document summary for nearly a year. Deepseek is better than all of them at it. The chatbot version of it is free. Price to use [its] API is 99.5% below the price of OpenAI\u2019s API. [shrug emoji]\u201d\n\nHow does OpenAI respond?\n\nLittle wonder OpenAI cofounder and CEO Sam Altman today said that the company was bringing its yet-to-be released second reasoning model family, o3, to ChatGPT even for free-tier users. OpenAI still appears to be carving its own path with more proprietary and advanced models \u2014 setting the industry standard.\n\nBut the question becomes: With DeepSeek, ByteDance and other Chinese AI companies nipping at its heels, how long can OpenAI remain in the lead at making and releasing new cutting-edge AI models? And if and when it falls, how hard and how fast will its decline be?\n\nOpenAI does have another historical precedent going for it, though. If DeepSeek and Chinese AI models do indeed become to LLMs as Google\u2019s open-source Android did to mobile \u2014 taking the lion\u2019s share of the market for a while \u2014 you only have to see how the Apple iPhone with its locked-down, proprietary, all-in-house approach managed to carve off the high end of the market and steadily expand downward from there, especially in the U.S., to the point that it now owns nearly 60% of the domestic smartphone market.\n\nStill, for all those spending big bucks to use AI models from leading labs, DeepSeek shows that the same capabilities may be available for much cheaper and with much greater control. And in an enterprise setting, that may be enough to win the ballgame."

            "article_content": "The haunted-house thriller Presence has a formal conceit so clever, I'm surprised it hasn't ever been done or attempted before. Maybe another movie has done it that I'm not aware of. This is a ghost story told entirely from the ghost's point of view: We see what the ghost sees.\n\nThe ghost cannot leave the house, and so the movie never leaves the house, either. You could say that the ghost is played by the director, Steven Soderbergh, who serves as his own cinematographer, as usual, working under the pseudonym of Peter Andrews. That's Soderbergh holding the camera as it glides up and down the stairs, following the characters from room to room, and hovering over them as they try to figure out what's going on.\n\nAs the movie opens, Rebecca and Chris, played by Lucy Liu and Chris Sullivan, are about to move into a handsome Craftsman-style house with their two teenage children. The family dynamics are tense and a little on-the-nose: Rebecca, a high-strung type who works in finance, clearly favors their popular, jockish son, Tyler. Chris is the mellower spouse and parent, and he has a close bond with their daughter, Chloe, who's quieter and more withdrawn.\n\nEven as we get to know this foursome, though, the movie's most interesting and enigmatic character is the silent specter behind the camera. You keep asking yourself, who is this ghost, and what does it want? Is it the spirit of the house's previous owner, or is it someone else entirely, who has some unspoken connection with the family?\n\nBefore long, paranormal things start to happen. The ghost begins manifesting itself in physical ways, making the lights flicker and the walls rattle, or knocking a cup of juice to the floor. Initially, only Chloe, played by Callina Liang, seems to notice these strange phenomena, and she tries in vain to tell her parents and Tyler about what's happening.\n\nTyler, played by Eddy Maday, is a bit of a hothead. He has little patience with his sister's anxieties, which, we soon learn, are tied to a recent tragedy involving one of her best friends. Presence isn't just an unsettling ghost story; it's one of the more incisive recent movies I've seen about the inner lives of teenagers, whether it's their feelings of loneliness and disaffection or their vulnerability to high-school gossip and worse.\n\nEventually, Chloe begins dating Ryan, a friend of Tyler's, and there's a voyeuristic queasiness to the way the camera \u2014 which is to say, the ghost \u2014 eavesdrops on their moments of intimacy. There's nothing prurient about these moments; on the contrary, what you feel is the ghost's enormous concern for Chloe.\n\nSoderbergh's camera movements are so delicate and expressive, he can convey empathy with a mere twitch or shudder, or rage with a sudden, violent lurch. Before long, we realize that the ghost isn't trying to scare this family; it's trying to warn them.\n\nNo American director is churning out independent movies as deftly and resourcefully as Steven Soderbergh. This is his latest collaboration with the veteran screenwriter David Koepp, whom he last worked with on the home-invasion thriller Kimi, which ingeniously reinvented Hitchcock's Rear Window for the age of Alexa and COVID.\n\nLike Kimi, but in a completely different way, Presence makes brilliant use of spatial confinement and extracts maximal tension from a minimalist premise. As ever, Soderbergh seems to have approached this material as a technical challenge, a problem to be solved: How do you make a movie entirely from a ghost's POV? Soderbergh has mentioned in interviews that he wore martial-arts slippers, so as to muffle his footsteps as he chased his actors around the house with his camera. I'm not usually big on behind-the-scenes documentaries, but Presence is one movie I'd make an exception for.\n\nBut while Soderbergh may be flexing his technique, Presence never feels like a mere exercise. That's mainly due to the fine actors, especially Liang as the sensitive, troubled Chloe and Sullivan as a loving family man trying to keep the peace in a frightening situation. Their performances are haunting in every sense of the word.\n\nCopyright 2025 NPR"

But there is no cure for HIV or AIDS or a vaccine for human use to prevent infection.\n\nOne of the labs involved in current research to design such a vaccine is at La Jolla-based Scripps Research, which recently made a discovery that could drive development of the vaccine.\n\nMany vaccines work by introducing a protein to the body that resembles part of a virus. Ideally, the immune system will produce long-lasting antibodies recognizing that virus, thereby providing protection.\n\nBut Scripps Research scientists said they have found that for some HIV vaccines, something else happens. After a few applications, the immune system begins to produce antibodies against immune complexes already bound to the viral protein.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique reaction in which antibodies bind to other antibodies, which is rare,\u201d said Scripps researcher Sharidan Brown, first author of a study published Jan. 17 in Science Immunology. \u201cOver the course of multiple immunizations [in animals], we have found four classes of antibodies that cling to other antibodies. They are unique responses, so by understanding the structure for the first time, we are put on the right foot to understand these better and can harness them for not only HIV vaccine design but other therapeutics.\u201d\n\nThe observation came about when researchers in the lab of Andrew Ward, a professor of integrative structural and computational biology at Scripps Research, was using advanced imaging tools to study how antibodies evolve after multiple HIV vaccine doses. A technique the lab invented, known as Electron Microscopy-Based Polyclonal Epitope Mapping, or EMPEM, let the researchers see exactly where on the virus antibodies bind.\n\nWhen they carried out the experiments on blood from animals that had received multiple doses of an experimental HIV vaccine, they discovered that some of the antibodies were not binding directly to the HIV viral antigen but to immune molecules on its surface.\n\nIt isn\u2019t yet known whether this binding is a good thing in designing an effective vaccine, but Brown said future studies should answer that question.\n\n\u201cIt adds to our understanding of what these vaccines are capable of eliciting,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe don\u2019t fully know what these antibodies do yet, but by understanding and future experiments looking into why they get elicited and what they do, we can adjust vaccine studies to make them more effective by either harnessing or getting rid of it.\n\n\u201cIt could be a good thing [that the antibodies bind together] because it could give the immune system a bigger set of antibodies. Or it could be detrimental in that it is not making antibodies the body needs.\u201d\n\nShe and others in the lab \u201care excited to see where these antibodies fit into the immune response and the body\u2019s ability to fight off HIV,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could lead to redesigning vaccines to target or eliminate these responses and could lead to better vaccines.\u201d\n\nImplementation of any vaccine stemming from this discovery is years away from human trials, but Brown said an effective vaccine would have a great impact.\n\n\u201cThere are still millions of people diagnosed with HIV, so having a vaccine would impact the lives of people around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving a vaccine that prevents infection would be instrumental in reducing the spread. Right now, there are no vaccines in use in humans. There are clinical trials in humans, which is exciting, and we have made a lot of progress toward eliciting the types of antibodies with these vaccines in the past five years or so. This [discovery] is an extra data point to think about when we design these vaccines and could help us better design boosting immunizations.\u201d\n\nBrown, a native of Montana, \u201cwhere I fell in love with science,\u201d said she came to Scripps Research for her Ph.D. studies and was placed in her current lab to research immunology and structural biology.\n\n\u201cI feel super lucky to work in the lab I do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have such a diverse, large lab of people full of amazing ideas.\u201d\n\nThe next step for the lab is to look at the antibody responses in other models.\n\n\u201cWe want to understand how they are generated and what they do, and any consequences to these antibodies being around,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThen we can modify these types of responses in vaccine design.\u201d \u2666"

This hazy planet, located about 47 light-years away from Earth, orbits a red dwarf star. Initially thought to be a mini-Neptune, new observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal it is more similar to Venus-but on a much larger scale.\n\nEnaiposha's thick atmosphere and composition set it apart, making it unlike anything seen before. Scientists have introduced a new category, calling it a \"Super-Venus,\" as it shares characteristics with Venus yet stands out due to its size and other unique features.\n\nThis discovery not only changes what we know about exoplanets but also highlights the diversity of planets beyond our solar system. It opens doors for further exploration and a deeper understanding of the universe.\n\nAccording to The Independent, new in-depth observations using the James Webb Space Telescope data suggests it is much more similar to Venus, the hottest planet in the Solar System. However, Enaiposha is believed to be much larger than Venus, which would make it the first known planet of its kind.\n\nAstronomers are referring to this new category as 'super-Venus' and Enaiposha is unlike anything else in the Solar System. Scientists can potentially gather information about it that could aid our understanding of other exoplanets and how they function. Alas, there are still some problems at hand with observing Enaiposha, which is 47 light-years from Earth, as its atmosphere is so thick, it can't be seen very easily."

            "article_content": "Despite its massive scale, Stargate intends to employ \u201cat least\u201d 57 full-time employees earning an average wage of just $57,600 annually, according to documents seen by Bloomberg regarding the ambitious data center project.\n\nStargate was introduced earlier this week as a data center project intended to power AI systems for OpenAI, which has distanced itself from Microsoft due to its unwillingness to provide more resources. The startup is partnering with Oracle and SoftBank on the project, which will help operate the facilities and raise more capital, respectively. The group further intends to raise $500 billion over the next four years to open more data centers beyond the first one in Abilene, Texas, on a site the size of New York\u2019s Central Park.\n\nData centers are frequently announced in states across the U.S. to great fanfare as governors and local officials applaud the economic opportunity for their regions. However, data centers typically do not employ very many people once the construction is finished, at least not directly. President Trump announced Stargate alongside the group\u2019s leaders earlier this week, saying it would create \u201cover 100,000 American jobs.\u201d But that number appears nebulous, which is a guess for the indirect number of jobs that will be created in the AI industry thanks to the larger capacity. How that number was determined is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nIn past years, Apple has defended the fees it charges App Store developers, citing the number of people indirectly employed across the U.S. in app development.\n\nBloomberg examined the number of permanent workers employed by other data centers in Texas and found the numbers to be quite small. Microsoft employs just 325 people across all its data centers in Texas, but that number is in the thousands during construction. \u201cWe estimate it will take approximately 11.8 million work hours and more than 2,892 jobs during peak construction to complete the construction of new data centers,\u201d a report reads.\n\nTech companies often tout these numbers to get tax breaks. Abilene has given Stargate an 85% discount on its property taxes for two decades of its operations.\n\nIn addition to concerns about data centers using massive amounts of energy and harming fragile power grids, locals in some communities across the U.S. have complained about the visual blight of massive beige data centers the size of football fields sitting in view of their homes. President Trump says he will expedite the construction of power plants co-located beside data centers, including even ones using coal.\n\nThe tech industry has gotten behind the new Republican White House as it has lifted regulation on AI safety and committed to beating China in the race to dominance, even though massive returns on investment have not yet materialized and Trump pledges to cede America\u2019s chances of beating China in another field, electric cars. Tech leaders have been beating the drum that China\u2019s domination in artificial intelligence threatens U.S. national security. Maybe it\u2019s true, but the likes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also have some self-interest in making these statements."

            "article_content": "What\u2019s new: After weeks of buzz, OpenAI has released Operator, its first AI agent. Operator is a web app that can carry out simple online tasks in a browser, such as booking concert tickets or filling an online grocery order. The app is powered by a new model called Computer-Using Agent\u2014CUA for short\u2014built on top of OpenAI\u2019s multimodal large language model GPT-4o.\n\n\n\nWhy it matters: OpenAI claims that Operator outperforms similar rival tools, including Anthropic\u2019s Computer Use and Google DeepMind\u2019s Mariner. The fact that three of the world\u2019s top AI firms have converged on the same vision of what agent-based models could be makes one thing clear. The battle for AI supremacy has a new frontier\u2014and it\u2019s our computer screens. Read the full story.\n\n\u2014Will Douglas Heaven\n\n+ If you\u2019re interested in reading more about AI agents, check out this piece explaining why they\u2019re AI\u2019s next big thing.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for robots\n\n\u2014James O\u2019Donnell\n\nIn the many conversations I\u2019ve had about robots, I\u2019ve also found that most people tend to fall into three camps. Some are upbeat and vocally hopeful that a future is just around the corner in which machines can expertly handle much of what is currently done by humans, from cooking to surgery. Others are scared: of job losses, injuries, and whatever problems may come up as we try to live side by side.\n\n\n\nThe final camp, which I think is the largest, is just unimpressed. We\u2019ve been sold lots of promises that robots will transform society ever since the first robotic arm was installed on an assembly line at a General Motors plant in New Jersey in 1961. Few of those promises have panned out so far.\n\nBut this year, there\u2019s reason to think that even those staunchly in the \u201cbored\u201d camp will be intrigued by what\u2019s happening in the robot races. Here\u2019s a glimpse at what to keep an eye on this year. Read the full story."

            "article_content": "GUEST OPINION: The retail landscape is undergoing a remarkable transformation fueled by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). From physical storefronts to digital platforms, AI is revolutionizing the industry, reshaping operations, and redefining customer experiences. But what lies ahead for the future of AI in the retail industry ?\n\nLet\u2019s explore the key trends and innovations driving this change.\n\nWhat does AI mean for retail?\n\nArtificial intelligence refers to the capability of machines to perform tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence, such as data analysis and decision-making. Its integration into the retail sector is unlocking unprecedented levels of efficiency and customer satisfaction. Whether online or offline, AI is paving the way for a smarter, more responsive, and customer-focused retail experience.\n\nAI transformations in online retail\n\nIn the e-commerce space, AI is centred on enhancing personalization and streamlining customer interactions. By analyzing massive amounts of customer data - from browsing history to purchase behaviour - AI delivers tailored experiences that feel intuitive and engaging. Tools like recommendation systems, AI chatbots, and visual search technologies create a seamless shopping journey.\n\nConsumers benefit from faster, more convenient interactions, while retailers enjoy higher conversion rates and increased sales. These innovations underscore the growing importance of the future of AI in the retail industry for e-commerce.\n\nAI\u2019s role in physical retail\n\nAI\u2019s influence is not limited to online platforms. Physical stores are leveraging AI-powered tools such as cameras and sensors to optimize operations and enhance customer experiences. These technologies monitor foot traffic, track inventory levels, and provide real-time product recommendations.\n\nFor shoppers, this translates to a more personalized and efficient experience, bridging the gap between the convenience of digital platforms and the tactile benefits of in-store shopping. Such advancements illustrate how the future of AI in the retail industry is shaping brick-and-mortar spaces.\n\nEmerging trends in AI for retail\n\nAccording to a study by Fortune Business Insights, the global AI market in retail, valued at $4.84 billion in 2021, is projected to reach an astounding $52.94 billion by 2029. This exponential growth highlights several transformative trends.\n\nAI for retail automation\n\nRepetitive tasks like inventory tracking, pricing updates, and customer support are prime candidates for AI automation. By automating these processes, retailers can focus on strategic priorities and reduce operational inefficiencies.\n\nAI tools excel at analyzing sales data to identify trends, forecast demand, and optimize inventory management. They also simplify catalogue updates, ensuring product descriptions, availability, and pricing remain accurate across platforms.\n\nAI for customer service\n\nIn today\u2019s competitive market, superior customer service is essential. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are revolutionizing online retail by offering 24/7, human-like support. These tools handle customer inquiries, guide users through purchases, and personalize interactions based on past behaviours.\n\nIn physical stores, smart kiosks and mobile apps enhance customer engagement. Features like facial recognition enable real-time, personalized assistance, taking customer service to the next level.\n\nAI for retail personalization\n\nPersonalization is a cornerstone of the future of AI in the retail industry. Advanced AI technologies like natural language processing, visual search, and voice recognition help online shoppers find desired products quickly, providing a seamless experience.\n\nIn-store, AI-driven automated checkout systems simplify the payment process. By using computer vision and image recognition, these systems eliminate the need for traditional checkouts, enhancing convenience and hygiene for customers.\n\nAI for supply chain optimization\n\nEfficient supply chain management is another area where AI is making waves. By analyzing data on traffic, weather, and delivery schedules, AI tools optimize transportation routes, ensuring timely deliveries and reducing costs.\n\nAdditionally, AI enables real-time tracking and demand forecasting, helping retailers align stock levels with customer needs, minimizing delays, and improving overall logistics.\n\nAI for loss prevention\n\nAI is reshaping retail security by leveraging technologies like facial recognition and predictive analytics. These tools identify potential theft risks and monitor suspicious behaviour, enabling proactive loss prevention strategies. Predictive analytics also helps retailers design store layouts and allocate resources effectively, reducing shrinkage and improving overall security.\n\nReal-world application: Amazon Go\n\nAmazon Go provides a glimpse into the future of AI in the retail industry. These cashierless stores utilize cutting-edge AI technologies, including computer vision, IoT sensors, and deep learning algorithms, to create a seamless shopping experience. Shoppers can enter the store using a QR code, select items, and exit without waiting in line.

This hazy planet, located about 47 light-years away from Earth, orbits a red dwarf star. Initially thought to be a mini-Neptune, new observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal it is more similar to Venus-but on a much larger scale.\n\nEnaiposha's thick atmosphere and composition set it apart, making it unlike anything seen before. Scientists have introduced a new category, calling it a \"Super-Venus,\" as it shares characteristics with Venus yet stands out due to its size and other unique features.\n\nThis discovery not only changes what we know about exoplanets but also highlights the diversity of planets beyond our solar system. It opens doors for further exploration and a deeper understanding of the universe.\n\nAccording to The Independent, new in-depth observations using the James Webb Space Telescope data suggests it is much more similar to Venus, the hottest planet in the Solar System. However, Enaiposha is believed to be much larger than Venus, which would make it the first known planet of its kind.\n\nAstronomers are referring to this new category as 'super-Venus' and Enaiposha is unlike anything else in the Solar System. Scientists can potentially gather information about it that could aid our understanding of other exoplanets and how they function. Alas, there are still some problems at hand with observing Enaiposha, which is 47 light-years from Earth, as its atmosphere is so thick, it can't be seen very easily."

            "article_content": "Value Stream Management (VSM) was all the rage a few years ago, but now there\u2019s a new contender for measuring how much value software is driving: Software Engineering Intelligence.\n\n\u201cWhile Value Stream Management continued to lose steam in 2024, we also saw the fast emergence of Software Engineering Intelligence (SEI) to take its place,\u201d Derek Holt, CEO of Digital.ai, told SD Times while making predictions for 2025.\n\nHolt was interviewed in the most recent episode of our podcast to talk more about this trend, explaining that SEI is the application of both data driven insights and predictive AI to measure and improve not only the process of delivering software, but also the outcomes of that software development.\n\n\u201cThis includes both rear view metrics of how things have trended in the past, but also looks at predictive insights to be able to identify areas for improvement, risk avoidance, etc,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the rear view mirror is smaller than the windshield in a car, and we think it is that balance of both views that are going to help organizations just get better and better at predictably, building and delivering great software.\u201d\n\nThere are a couple of different reasons why Holt believes SEI will gain more traction in the year ahead.\n\nFirst, organizations are continuing to look at how to mature the way they build and deliver software.\n\nSecond, there is pressure on companies to adopt AI in their software development process, but they don\u2019t necessarily have the data to justify whether or not AI has resulted or will result in improvements.\n\nThird, we now have the technology stack needed to gather structured and unstructured data from third-party tools and provide it in a dashboard and perform predictive insights on that data.\n\nLooking back to VSM, it really was designed to help answer two questions:\n\nHow good are we at building software? How good is the software we build right now?\n\n\u201cI know those are a lot of the same words, but they\u2019re wildly different things,\u201d Holt explained. \u201cI could be really great at building, let\u2019s say, a new smartphone, but if the smartphone isn\u2019t wanted by anybody, it doesn\u2019t really matter that I was good at building it. And at the same time, I could have the best idea for the next generation smartphone, but if I don\u2019t have a way to get the parts, manufacturing, and distribution, that idea is not worth a lot either.\u201d\n\nHolt believes that SEI is a part of the overall vision for VSM. It\u2019s not a complete departure from VSM, but rather a recognition of that first question.\n\nHe explained that development teams often have an easier time understanding how good they are at building software, and a harder time understanding the value they derive from that software, as that can vary based on business model, business strategy, market conditions, etc.\n\nHolt also emphasized that it\u2019s not an \u201ceither or\u201d when it comes to VSM vs SEI. \u201cI think it\u2019s a subset, and hopefully we continue to build towards the original vision of value stream management, just in a kind of a step function over time.\u201d\n\nFor teams looking to implement SEI, Holt says there are a few prerequisites. First, whatever vendors they\u2019re working with need to have ways to pull data from those systems, as no singular data source can provide that 360 degree view that is needed.\n\nAnother important foundation is the ability to scale. \u201cThese things are easy to demo,\u201d Holt said. \u201cThey\u2019re harder to scale across an enterprise. So I would really encourage folks, as they\u2019re doing evaluations, to make sure that they\u2019re partnering with folks that have done this at scale. And that\u2019s not just scale of data, it\u2019s also scale of users, scale of continuing to mature \u2026 getting value right away, but also then expanding the purview in terms of the types of intelligence that you\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\nHe also went on to say that it\u2019s important to have that 360 degree view so that you can ensure you\u2019re not only able to look back, but also predict future outcomes.\n\nHis final piece of advice is to not overanalyze the options in a way that prevents you from getting started. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very easy to look at this space and to spend a year debating and having a bit of analysis paralysis \u2026 But the very first view you get, the very first aggregation of multiple data sources that gives you insights into your business, even just one is better than where you were before. And so this is a journey, not a destination, and a key piece there is taking that first step. So I would just encourage folks to get started instead of waiting for perfection.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Economic losses from hurricanes and other natural disasters soared in the U.S. last year and were above average globally, reflecting another year of costly severe storms, floods and droughts.\n\nDamage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton helped push total economic losses from natural disasters in the U.S. to $217.8 billion last year, according to insurance broker Aon PLC. That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It's also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.\n\nInsured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022. In some areas, homes are such great a risk that they're too expensive to insure \u2014 if private insurance is even available at all.\n\nHurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the west coast of Florida, causing some $25 billion in economic losses.\n\n\"In 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\" said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \"When those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\"\n\nAt least two other hurricanes, several severe \"convective\" storms and a draught contributed to the losses from natural disasters in the U.S. last year.\n\nIn addition to the severe storms in the U.S., deadly floods in the Valencia region of Spain and other natural disasters drove worldwide economic losses from natural disasters to $368 billion last year, according to Aon. That's a 7.3% decline from 2023, but about 14% higher than the annual average going back to 2000. Global insured losses, meanwhile, climbed 15.1% to $145 billion.\n\nWhile it's impossible to predict the timing, location and losses from natural disasters, 2025 is not off to an encouraging start. The devastating wildfires that erupted in Los Angeles County on Jan. 7, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 14,000 structures, are already projected to be among the costliest natural disasters.\n\nIn a separate report last week, Aon estimated that total economic and insured losses for the two largest wildfires \u2014 the Palisades fire and the Eaton blaze burning just outside Los Angeles \u2014 could reach into the lower tens of billions of dollars, likely making them the costliest wildfires in U.S. history.\n\nPacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been devastated by the Palisades fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.\n\nAbout 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in a Jan.16 email to CBS MoneyWatch. An analysis of insurance data by CBS News San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods."

            "article_content": "FOB China prices for Mono PERC wafers remained steady this week, with Mono PERC M10 and G12 wafers priced at $0.144 per pc and $0.208/pc, respectively. Meanwhile, FOB China prices for n-type M10 and G12 wafers experienced slight increases, reaching $0.149/pc and $0.196/pc, respectively, reflecting a growth of 2.05% and 1.55% compared to the previous week.\n\nSince the start of 2025, n-type wafer prices have risen for three consecutive weeks, driven by production cuts and lower inventory levels. Large-scale production cuts by wafer companies since Q3 2024 have effectively reduced market inventory to about two weeks of production, significantly lower than the inventory levels of polysilicon and modules.\n\nThese developments have led wafer companies to raise their operating rates since early January, with the overall average now exceeding 50%. As a result, January wafer output is expected to reach approximately 46 GW, up 5.5% from 43.61 GW in October 2024.\n\nThe sustainability of the wafer price increase depends on a potential rebound in solar cell transaction prices, industry participants note. They also caution that wafer operating rates in the coming weeks will be critical. A significant rise in operating rates driven by higher prices could risk price drops after the Chinese New Year, as the current vast production capacity may quickly drive inventory levels back to high levels.\n\nAnother recent trend in the Chinese market is the sluggish sales of rectangular G12R (182 mm x 210 mm) wafers, which have driven prices downward. Sources attribute this to the rapid production ramp-up of this size across both upstream and downstream segments, surpassing its adoption by end users. Consequently, an oversupply of this specification has developed before it could gain traction as a mainstream product.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security expanded its ban list of China-based entities, adding four ingot and wafer manufacturers, including a subsidiary of a prominent solar integrated manufacturer. The action was taken on the grounds that these entities were found to source polysilicon from regions in China that do not comply with traceability requirements.\n\nInsiders widely believe that this U.S. decision will theoretically support increased demand for global polysilicon, though its impact has not yet been fully realized. It is also expected to further hinder the export of Chinese wafers and the modules derived from these wafer suppliers to the U.S. With these manufacturers excluded from the U.S. export market, reduced competition may stabilize or even increase wafer and module prices in the U.S. This move aligns with prior market expectations and reflects the U.S.\u2019 strategic intent to implement energy-related policies aimed at minimizing reliance on components associated with China.\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury updated safe harbor tables this week, introducing new default component cost percentages to account for the premium customers will pay for U.S.-made wafers, aiming to incentivize domestic wafer manufacturing. The bonus is seen as a \u201cdirect complement\u201d to the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit. While the inclusion of wafers in the guidance is considered significant, industry players remain skeptical about its impact on procurement activities or wafer manufacturing plans in the U.S.\n\nOPIS, a Dow Jones company, provides energy prices, news, data, and analysis on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, LPG/NGL, coal, metals, and chemicals, as well as renewable fuels and environmental commodities.

            "date": "Security Boulevard9h",
            "source": "Security Boulevard",
            "article_content": "When I started working with cloud architecture a decade ago, running critical workloads across multiple cloud providers would have seemed needlessly complex. Today, it\u2019s becoming the norm. Companies are embracing multi-cloud strategies not just because they want to avoid vendor lock-in, but because different providers excel at other things. The challenge? Security becomes exponentially more difficult when you\u2019re working across distributed architectures. After years of building cloud-based applications for global enterprises, I\u2019ve learned that the old perimeter-based security models just don\u2019t cut it anymore \u2013 we need a new framework that tackles architectural security and compliance head-on.\n\nThe adoption of multi-cloud deployments presents challenges that extend far beyond simple workload distribution. Each cloud provider brings security models, compliance certifications and native services. This diversity offers powerful capabilities but creates significant hurdles in maintaining consistent security controls and compliance standards across environments.\n\nEncyption Challenge\n\nOne significant challenge I\u2019ve faced was ensuring consistent encryption standards across AWS and other cloud providers for a data analytics pipeline. The project involved processing sensitive customer data, and we needed to maintain end-to-end encryption while leveraging services from both clouds. This challenge was solved by implementing a custom key management service that integrated with AWS KMS and the other providers\u2019 key management solution, allowing for a single source of truth for encryption keys. At the same time, ensuring data remained protected as it moved between cloud environments.\n\nThis encryption challenge highlighted a broader truth about multi-cloud architectures: Identity and access management form the cornerstone of secure cross-cloud operations. The secure multi-cloud architecture is built around one core thing: Unified identity management. Organizations can\u2019t easily manage identities across the multitude of cloud services they use when each has its identity system. So, to gain efficiency and effectiveness, and to have a semblance of personality across the cloud, organizations need a way to manage all those identities (and all those accesses) in a unified manner. If you get it right, that setup also provides the comfy feel of perspiration across the entire cloud ecosystem.\n\nMulti-cloud environments necessitate special consideration for data protection. Organizations should set up classification systems that work across all cloud boundaries and ensure that sensitive data is classified and receives the appropriate protection no matter where it is stored or used. This should be done through a seamless, yet secure, infrastructure across the cloud boundary; encryption standards should meet the highest common denominator across the cloud service providers; powerful data residency controls should govern where the data is allowed to live and operate; and a consistent key management strategy throughout the multi-cloud architecture should ensure that only cloud-visible personnel have access to the necessary keys to unlock the data.\n\nThe careful crafting of network security architecture is needed in multi-cloud environments to provide consistent protection while taking advantage of each provider\u2019s strengths. This includes interconnecting the different cloud providers securely and implementing consistent micro-segmentation policies. The outcome we\u2019re looking for is a unified security posture that lets us maintain visibility and control across all the cloud environments we happen to be in.\n\nTo illustrate these network security principles in action, consider our implementation for a high-traffic e-commerce platform. Our platform uses AWS Transit Gateway to implement a hub-and-spoke network architecture that connects multiple VPCs across different AWS regions. We extended this model to include our multi-cloud resources by setting up dedicated interconnects and implementing consistent security groups and NACLs across all environments. We also utilized AWS Network Firewall to create a centralized inspection point for all cross-cloud traffic, allowing us to implement uniform security policies regardless of the traffic\u2019s origin or destination.\n\nThe technical controls alone cannot secure multi-cloud environments. Organizations must conduct cloud security architecture reviews before implementing any multi-cloud solution. These reviews should focus on:\n\nData flow patterns between clouds\n\nAuthentication and authorization requirements\n\nCompliance obligations across all relevant jurisdictions\n\nCompleting these tasks thoroughly and diligently will ensure that multi-cloud security is baked into the architectural layer between the clouds and in the clouds themselves.\n\nWhile thorough architecture reviews establish the foundation, automation brings these security principles to life at scale. Automation provides a major advantage to security operations for multi-cloud environments. By treating infrastructure and security as code, organizations can achieve consistent configurations across clouds, implement automated security testing and enable fast response to security events. This helps with the overall security and operational overhead because it allows us to do more with less and to reduce human error.\n\nOur security operations experienced a substantial enhancement when we moved to automated compliance checks. Still, we did not just throw AWS services at the problem. We engaged our security team deeply in the process. We had them create rules that continuously monitored our multi-cloud environment for compliance with PCI DSS standards. This automation allowed us to detect and remediate misconfigurations in near real-time. If we miss something in the continuous compliance monitoring, we have a CI/CD pipeline check to catch it before changes are deployed. All told, this saves us an impressive number of hours each year. Moreover, it moves us closer to a state in which we can confidently assert that we are compliant, on top of the auditability problems plaguing us previously.\n\nSeveral emerging trends are molding security demands as multi-cloud architectures rapidly develop. The burgeoning edge computing is broadening the security perimeter, whereas cloud-tethered zero trust is becoming the norm. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence and machine learning are being integrated to bolster security monitoring and response capabilities, producing a more proactive security posture.\n\nHow Multi-Cloud Security Might Evolve\n\nBased on my experience working with large-scale distributed systems, I envision the future of multi-cloud security evolving in several key areas:\n\nUnified Security Orchestration: I foresee the development of more sophisticated, cloud-agnostic security orchestration platforms. These will provide a single pane of glass for managing security across all cloud environments, automatically adapting to each provider\u2019s specific implementations while maintaining consistent policies.\n\nAI-Driven Threat Detection: As our systems grow more complex, AI and machine learning will play an increasingly crucial role in identifying and responding to security threats. I expect to see more advanced, self-learning systems that can correlate events across multiple cloud environments to detect sophisticated, distributed attacks that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n\nQuantum-Resistant Encryption: With the looming threat of quantum computing, I anticipate a shift towards implementing quantum-resistant encryption algorithms across all cloud environments. This will be crucial for maintaining long-term data security in a multi-cloud world.\n\nAutomated Compliance Management: The future will likely bring more advanced automation in compliance management. I envision systems that can automatically adjust configurations across multiple clouds to maintain compliance with changing regulations, reducing the manual overhead associated with multi-cloud compliance.\n\nEdge-to-Cloud Security: As edge computing grows, I expect to see more integrated security solutions that seamlessly extend from edge devices through multiple clouds. This will likely involve new protocols and standards for maintaining consistent security postures across highly distributed architectures.\n\nIdentity-Centric Security: I anticipate a shift towards fully identity-centric security models that go beyond current identity and access management. These models will use advanced behavioral analytics and continuous authentication to make access decisions regardless of a resource\u2019s cloud environment.\n\nBlockchain for Multi-Cloud Integrity: I foresee potential applications of blockchain technology for maintaining verifiable audit trails and ensuring data integrity across multi-cloud environments, particularly for highly regulated industries.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can create more resilient, efficient and secure multi-cloud architectures that can adapt to the evolving threat landscape while supporting the growing complexity of modern enterprise applications.\n\nThese emerging trends and future directions aren\u2019t just theoretical possibilities \u2013 they\u2019re essential steps for organizations building secure multi-cloud architectures today. As someone who has witnessed and participated in the transformation of cloud security over the past decade, I\u2019m convinced that success in this space requires technical excellence and strategic foresight. The framework outlined here provides a foundation, but staying ahead of evolving threats and technological capabilities will require continuous adaptation and innovation."

            "article_content": "Hooray, quantum physics is 100 years old! To celebrate, the United Nations has declared 2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology. It has been 100 years since Werner Heisenberg coined the term quantum mechanics and laid its mathematical foundations. Today, tech giants and research institutions from all over the world are trying to develop a powerful quantum computer that is supposed to solve all of humanity's problems. No one can predict when and if this will actually happen. As a quantum physicist, I am optimistic that quantum technology will indeed achieve a great deal one day. However, it is highly unlikely that 2025 will herald this major breakthrough.\n\nAnzeige\n\nAn opinon by Dr. Sabrina Patsch Sabrina Patsch has a PhD in quantum physics, is a science blogger and a passionate science slam participant. She has been an editor at c't since 2024 and writes about science.\n\nBut that doesn't matter, because instead of more sensations, breakthroughs and groundbreaking experiments, quantum research currently needs something completely different: a good dose of realism. Uncontrolled hype does not help anyone, especially not research that cannot live up to these unrealistic expectations. Great research results are then no longer met with recognition, but with disillusionment, even disappointment.\n\nOne reason for this hype is that hardly anyone who does not work in the field really understands quantum theory. Even worse, it is overshadowed by the words of Richard Feynman: \"If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics.\" Many people use this quote as a free pass to give up. But Feynman didn't mean it to be so all-encompassing. Although we cannot explain why quantum objects behave the way they do, researchers have a very good understanding of the rules that govern the quantum world.\n\nNot everyone needs to understand these rules to the core. However, everyone has the opportunity to take a look into the quantum world with books, blogs, videos, lectures and even experiments to do at home \u2013 and the Quantum Year is the perfect opportunity to do so. Those with a better understanding of quantum physics are less likely to be blinded by exaggerated promises and at the same time can marvel at the fascinating world that lies dormant.\n\n(spa)"

            "article_content": "One of the key factors for the sustenance of eight billion people globally has been agriculture, and that sector, in turn, has been fuelled by fertilisers such as ammonia. However, due to high volumes, ammonia production contributes significantly to carbon emissions.\n\nBut this is likely to soon change.\n\nA new study published in scientific journal Joule has revealed a new ground-breaking method to produce ammonia under moderate subsurface conditions. Many believe this could impact the agriculture sector the world over and even reduce carbon emissions.\n\nAmmonia is a critical component of fertilisers and an emerging green fuel. For over a century it was produced by using Haber-Bosch process under high temperature and pressure.\n\nThe report claims ammonia can be produced in Earth\u2019s subsurface as it houses similar conditions, in turn offering a sustainable and energy-efficient alternative.\n\nThe study\u2019s findings have prompted the creation of Addis Energy, a company aiming to commercialise the process. Speaking to MIT Technology Review, Addis Energy\u2019s CEO Mark Bennett said, \u201cOur technology has the potential to address the dual challenges of food security and climate change by revolutionising ammonia production.\u201d\n\nAmmonia: Key to food systems and clean energy\n\nAmmonia is essential for modern agriculture, with most fertilisers relying on this compound to boost crop yields. However, the current Haber-Bosch process used to produce ammonia is highly energy-intensive, consuming 1-2% of global energy annually and emitting about 1.8% of global carbon dioxide. This dependence on fossil fuels has drawn widespread criticism as industries worldwide now face an increasing pressure to \u201cdecarbonise.\u201d\n\nThe discovery opens new possibilities for using naturally occurring chemical reactions to produce ammonia at lower energy inputs. The research team demonstrated that nitrogen and hydrogen react with specific minerals to form ammonia, mimicking subsurface geological processes.\n\nThe lead researcher, Dr Emily Rhodes, explained, \u201cThis method not only replicates natural processes but also provides an opportunity to dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of ammonia production.\u201d\n\nBroader applications and industry impact\n\nThe implications extend beyond agriculture. Ammonia is also emerging as a clean fuel for sectors like shipping, where its high energy density and zero carbon emissions make it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. This breakthrough could accelerate ammonia\u2019s adoption by addressing one of its major drawbacks: The emissions associated with its production.\n\nThe formation of Addis Energy highlights the growing focus on translating scientific discoveries into industrial applications. Bennett noted that the company aims to build pilot facilities to demonstrate the technology\u2019s scalability. \u201cOur priority is to ensure the process is not only environmentally sustainable but also economically competitive with existing methods,\u201d he said.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nWhile the technology shows promise, significant challenges remain. Scaling the process from the lab to commercial operations will require substantial investment and validation. Additionally, existing infrastructure tailored to the Haber-Bosch method may need significant adaptations to accommodate this new approach.\n\nExperts also point to the regulatory landscape as a key factor. Any new ammonia production technology must meet strict safety and environmental standards, particularly as the chemical has dual-use applications in agriculture and energy.\n\nA step towards sustainability\n\nThis discovery aligns with broader global efforts to reduce industrial emissions and transition to sustainable energy systems. If successful, Addis Energy\u2019s innovation could reshape two major industries \u2014 agriculture and shipping \u2014 while contributing to climate goals.\n\nDr Rhodes emphasised the potential impact: \u201cThis is a pivotal step toward transforming a vital yet carbon-intensive process into one that aligns with a sustainable future.\u201d\n\nThe next decade will determine whether this breakthrough can move from promise to practice, but its potential to drive change is undeniable."
