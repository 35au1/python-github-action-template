Fourth St.\n\nThese vehicles, which include things such as a replica of the 1960s Batmobile, a Delorean with a flux capacitor and even an \"invisible\" Boatmobile from the animated series \"Spongebob Squarepants,\" showcase a look at the most odd, weird and quirky things someone might see driving down the street.\n\n'Oddities' in Salina: A fun exhibition to curate\n\nMatthew Miller-Wells, the director of education for The Garage who worked on getting vehicles this exhibition, said it has been one of the more fun things to curate.\n\n\"There's just some weird, obscure stuff here,\" Miller-Wells said.\n\nIt's not only the 1995 \"ChewBaru,\" a Subaru Boxer covered with dental tools, dentures, toothbrushes and more, that excites Miller-Wells, but the rare vehicles that have gone out of style.\n\n\"The (K-Car) '83 LeBaron that's over there excites me just as much as like the (floating) Amphicar, because you just don't see those anymore,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to the words that have already been used to describe this show, like odd and weird, he said one word is going to stick with him as people visit.\n\n\"I think 'polarizing' could absolutely be one,\" he said. \"There are cars here that people will love to see and ones that people will be really confused and don't like.\n\n\"That's the fun of it, is that what is strange is subjective. Someone may think it makes no sense that a K-Car is in here, because they remember a time when they were everywhere.\"\n\nThe Garage, an automotive museum in downtown Salina, opened its latest exhibition this week: \"Oddities.\" The exhibition, which features such vehicles as the Batmobile, a UFO and an amphibious car, will be on display through the end of the year.\n\nWhen is 'Oddities' on display in Salina? How much is admission?\n\n\"Oddities\" is now open at The Garage for people to come and see.\n\nDaily general admission for the museum is $15, with discounts for seniors, students and military being $12.\n\nThe museum is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays.\n\nMemberships are also available beginning at $45 a year, with unlimited admission to the museum and other benefits included.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Salina Journal: Salina automobile museum's newest exhibit includes the weird and odd"

        "article_content": "Fans at Jane's Addiction's Boston concert were left scratching their heads after frontman Perry Farrelllaunched a physical attack on guitarist Dave Navarro. Some concertgoers, including photographer Brian MacKenzie, believe the shocking brawl may have been nothing more than a staged stunt.\n\nThe incident, which took place Friday night at the Leader Bank Pavilion, erupted during the band's performance of \"Ocean Size.\" Farrell, visibly agitated, started hurling expletives at the crowd before turning his fury on Navarro. According to a now-viral video, Farrell aggressively shoved Navarro, leading to a confrontation that spiraled out of control.\n\nBut as punches flew and Farrell was dragged offstage by crew members, fans were left divided on what they had just witnessed. MacKenzie, who was hired to snap photos of the show, shared his disbelief on social media.\n\n\"The crowd believed the whole thing was a bit,\" MacKenzie tweeted. \"Perry had a huge bottle of wine with him all evening, and Navarro and Avery seemed angrier than usual throughout the show.\"\n\nThe incident caused division among fans\n\nOther fans echoed MacKenzie's sentiments, with one attendee writing on X (formerly Twitter), \"Was it real or staged? We were all confused. It seemed like a setup, but then Perry was hauled off, and the show just ended.\"\n\nThe altercation came to a head when Farrell threw two elbow jabs at Navarro, who tried to hold him back calmly. Several bandmates, including bassist Eric Avery, and crew members rushed in to break up the scuffle as the lights dimmed on stage.\n\nDespite the chaotic scene, the remaining band members-Navarro, Avery, and drummer Stephen Perkins-came forward to wave goodbye to the crowd, raising their hands in a peace gesture as if to diffuse any lingering confusion.\n\nOne fan remarked, \"Half the crowd was pissed the show ended early, and the other half thought they'd just witnessed the last Jane's Addiction show ever.\"\n\nNeither Farrell nor Navarro has commented on the altercation, leaving the situation shrouded in mystery. The silence only adds fuel to the speculation that the whole brawl could have been a stunt to add drama to the band's reunion tour.\n\nIs this the end of Jane's Addiction?\n\nThis isn't the first time Jane's Addiction's performances have faced challenges. During a show at Pier 17 in NYC earlier this month, Farrell confessed to fans that his voice wasn't in top shape, saying, \"Something's wrong with my voice. I just can't get the notes out all of a sudden.\"\n\nDespite the vocal struggles and Friday's altercation, Jane's Addiction is scheduled to continue their North American tour with a performance at the Hartford Healthcare Amphitheater in Connecticut on Sept. 15. However, music fans are now left wondering if Friday's meltdown was just part of the act or a sign of deeper tensions within the band.\n\nWith so much uncertainty surrounding the band's future, one thing remains clear: the Boston crowd experienced a night they won't soon forget, staged or not."

The terms of the contract with MDIS includes understanding of certain key AI systems, stakeholders, value chains, and market structures, etc.\n\n\u201cThe objectives of the study is to examine the emerging and potential competition issues in these markets, and to study the scope and nature of AI applications, and assess associated opportunities, risks and ramifications from a competition standpoint,\u201d the official statement said.\n\nIn April this year, the competition watchdog had invited proposals for the study. \u201cThe transformative capabilities of AI have significant pro-competitive potential, both on the supply and the demand side. At the same time, there may be concerns with regard to potential competition risks stemming from the use of AI. The proposed study will be a knowledge building exercise to develop an in-depth understanding of the emerging competition dynamics in the development ecosystems of AI systems and implications of AI applications for competition, efficiency and innovation in key user industries,\u201d the tender notice said.\n\nAlso Read Meet Nepal\u2019s Richest Man \u2013 The billionaire behind Wai Wai noodles; Know about his career, education, love for Bollywood, and net worth F&O market faces major shake-up RIL\u2019s 47th AGM today: A look at how the stock performed in last one year Category expansion for q-comm firms may happen at a slow pace\n\nMeanwhile, rise of Big Tech is forcing regulators around the world to re-look at their existing laws.

Apple today released three new Apple Intelligence ads and while all three of them made it clear through storytelling what each feature promoted does and how it can help you, Apple did jump the gun with one of the videos. This ad showed how Siri can go through all of your data on your phone to find the name of someone you met during a chance meeting three months ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Apple didn't tell you and which wasn't apparent from the clip, is that you would have had to mention the meeting and the name of the person you encountered in a message or an email. By the way, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, this feature won't be available until next March . Still, the ads were pretty clear and might have left you with an idea about how you might use each feature.\n\n\n\n\n\nGalaxy AI stars where \"everyone gets the superpowers of Galaxy AI >\" Samsung blew an opportunity here to show how great AI features like Live Translate can help two people who speak completely different languages engage in a phone call and understand what the other person is saying. On the other hand, Samsung dropped three promo videos today for its Galaxy AI platform and they have all the sophistication of your typical Saturday morning cartoon series for kids. Talking app icons are transported to another planet bystars where \"everyone gets the superpowers of>\" Samsung blew an opportunity here to show how great AI features like Live Translate can help two people who speak completely different languages engage in a phone call and understand what the other person is saying.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of a helpful video, we get a cartoon app icon saying, \"It tastes like AI.\" Now I ask you, what does AI taste like? Chicken? What is it supposed to taste like? When one of the Galaxy AI stars pulls off an AI possession of the Samsung Internet Explorer app icon by entering his/her body(?), the app icon says, \"I feel warm and fuzzy.\" Hmm. Samsung isn't a pharmaceutical firm and I don't think it is going to sell many Galaxy AI phones this way.\n\n\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nGalaxy AI stars inside the Messages app, the icon is told like a baby at feeding time to \"Say Ah! Here it comes.\"\n\n\n\nFinally, the Internet Explorer app icon shows off Circle to Search which is not a hard concept to understand in the first place. When the app icon was asked \"How did you do that?\" the response was, \"I don't know...it just happened.\" Yikes!

The stunt caused an injury that forced him to withdraw from the show.\n\n22nd July: MasterChef's Gregg Wallace admits he broke down in tears and got a nasty stress rash on his face during his time on Strictly in 2014.\n\n22nd July: Despite ongoing issues, the Strictly professional cast begin rehearsals for this year's series.\n\n23rd July: Celebrity agent Melanie Blake claims she was sexually assaulted by an unnamed pro dancer while backstage on the show, and claims she witnessed ageism, rudeness and a rough treatment to the point of injury.\n\n23rd July: Strictly is forced to beef up security after 'an intruder scales the wall of the rehearsal studio'.\n\n23rd July: BBC boss Tim Davie breaks his silence on the ongoing allegations against Strictly, saying he is 'deeply sorry', adding: \"Hundreds of people, be they pros, contestants or crew have been part of it and had a brilliant experience.\n\n\"At the same time if someone thinks there was something wrong or they want to talk about their experience then of course we want them to raise that with us. Be in no doubt we will take it seriously, listen and deal with it as appropriate.\"\n\n24th July: Strictly 2023 star Krishnan Guru-Murthy holds a bombshell interview with Amanda Abbington on Channel 4 news, where she claims she was bullied, with some of the 'humilation being of a sexual nature'.\n\n27th July: Laura Whitmore releases a statement regarding her Strictly experience, saying \"I thought my experience was specific to me but I\u2019ve since learned I was wrong\".\n\nShe adds she is not part of the official complaint, but has come forward to support Amanda with the BBC, alongside others.\n\n28th July: Laila Rouass speaks out against the accusations regarding Anton Du Beke, saying she \"never felt pressured\" by him and \"personally insisted on six to seven hours training a day\".\n\n10th August: Graziano breaks his silence on his Strictly axe, saying \"these vile, false allegations have ruined my life.\"\n\nHe also told of the \"shocking\" end to his friendship with Zara McDermott.\n\nWe also revealed that Amanda Abbington was also quizzed for a second time as Strictly execs recruited 15 new staff to monitor rehearsals.\n\n11th August: Just as the investigation was expected to conclude, Amanda made a dramatic intervention. Giovanni was on the brink of being cleared until Amanda handed in more text messages.\n\n24th August: Graziano Di Prima called in top lawyers to sue the BBC and to try to clear his name.

        "article_content": "Did you ever dream you had X-ray vision when you were a kid? While that might sound like something from comic books, new research published in Science this week could bring us one step closer to making it a reality.\n\nScientists have found a way to see inside the bodies of living animals without surgery by using a surprising tool: a food dye that is common in America. This breakthrough discovery revealed that the dye, known as tartrazine, can make skin, muscles, and connective tissues temporarily see-through!\n\nTartrazine is a yellow food dye commonly found in products like Doritos and other snacks in the U.S. The dye doesn\u2019t just colour food; it has an unexpected ability to change how light moves through tissues. Normally, light entering biological tissue scatters because of the different structures inside the body, like fatty membranes and cell nuclei. These structures have a different refractive index from the air around them, which is why light doesn\u2019t travel smoothly through our skin and other tissues.\n\nThis scattering effect is what keeps us from seeing through our skin - or anyone else's. However, in this study, tartrazine was found to reduce the amount of light scattering inside tissue, allowing light to penetrate more deeply. The result? Scientists could see through the skin of living animals.\n\nIn a fascinating experiment using mice, researchers applied tartrazine to the animals' skin. When rubbed onto the belly, the dye allowed scientists to clearly see the liver, intestines, and bladder beneath the skin. When applied to the scalp, they could even observe blood vessels in the brain!\n\nEven more amazing, the skin returned to its normal colour after the dye was washed off, meaning the effect wasn\u2019t permanent.\n\nTo understand how this works, think about what happens when you place a pencil in a glass of water. The pencil appears bent or distorted because light behaves differently when it passes through water compared to air. This is due to something called the refractive index, which measures how much light bends when it passes through different materials. The same principle applies when light passes through biological tissues like skin.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, biological tissues scatter light, making it impossible to see through them. The dye used in this study helps certain wavelengths of light pass through tissues more easily, reducing that scattering effect.\n\nWhile this discovery is ground-breaking, it\u2019s not perfect. The effect is limited by how deeply the dye can penetrate into tissues. For now, the transparency only works on surface-level tissues. However, the scientists are already developing techniques like micro-needling and injections to allow the dye to reach deeper layers of skin and tissue.\n\nAlthough this study was conducted on mice, the potential applications for humans are enormous. Imagine doctors being able to visualize organs, blood vessels, and deep tissues without invasive surgery. This technology could revolutionise fields like diagnostics, allowing for real-time monitoring of the body\u2019s internal structures with minimal risk to the patient.\n\nThe future possibilities are exciting. With further research, this dye technique could become a powerful tool for non-invasive medical imaging, bringing us closer to a world where X-ray vision isn\u2019t just a superpower - it\u2019s science.\n\nLISTEN ABOVE"

        "article_content": "Sunday marks the start of Hispanic Heritage Month, a celebration honoring the contributions and histories of Americans with roots in countries including Mexico, Venezuela and Cuba.\n\nThe observance spans two months honoring a long-established community whose influence is felt throughout the country.\n\n\u201cIt celebrates a vast community of Americans who have made invaluable contributions to the United States for over 300 years,\u201d the executive director of the National Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico Margie Huerta said. \u201cHispanic and Latinx people are making important contributions to American arts, culture and humanities, and all aspects of society, every single day.\u201d\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nWho started Hispanic Heritage Month?\n\nFrom newly arrived immigrants to native communities that have called these lands home for centuries, the community has gained considerable cultural and political clout since the occasion began in 1968 as a weeklong commemoration under President Lyndon Johnson. The legislation was sponsored by California Rep. Edward Roybal of Los Angeles, an Albuquerque native whose family moved to California when he was 6.\n\nIn 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law a bill sponsored by Illinois Sen. Paul Simon expanding National Hispanic Heritage Week to 30 days. Reagan used the moment to praise Hispanics and their cultural pillars of church and school, but most of all to extol the virtues of \"familia.\"\n\n\u201cAs the great poet Octavio Paz has said: \u2018In Hispanic morals, the true protagonist is the family,\u2019\u201d Reagan said in his address. \"I fear that too often, in the mad rush of modern American life, some people have not learned the great lesson of our Hispanic heritage: the lesson of family and home and church and community.\u201d\n\nWhen is Hispanic Heritage Month?\n\nHispanic Heritage Month is between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15.\n\nThe month\u2019s starting date is significant because it\u2019s the independence day for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Mexico, Chile and Belize mark their celebrations on Sept. 16, Sept. 18 and Sept. 21, respectively.\n\nStarting in the middle of the month also encompasses, on the celebration\u2019s latter end, Oct. 12. Known as Columbus Day in the United States, the day is referred to in Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries as Di\u0301a de la Raza, honoring the countries and peoples conquered by Spain and other European nations.\n\nHow is Hispanic Heritage Month celebrated?\n\nGabriela Baeza Ventura, a professor of Spanish at the University of Houston, previously told USA TODAY that Hispanic Heritage Month pays respect to a population with deep roots in the United States and a wide range of ancestral origins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful and important opportunity for the general public to visualize the contributions and presence of a community that has been in this territory since before the U.S. was formed as a nation,\u201d Ventura said. \u201cIt\u2019s a community that encompasses so many different nations, so many registers of Spanish and so many experiences.\u201d\n\nThough many celebrations revolve around fiestas, Mexican or Latin American food and popular images of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Day of the Dead, Ventura said it\u2019s time to commemorate other notable figures, both historical and those in our midst.\n\nShe cited Jovida Idar, an early 20th-century Mexican American journalist and activist from Laredo, Texas, whose image will be minted as part of the American Women Quarters Program, as well as Colombia-born Lina Hidalgo, who at age 27 became the first woman \u2013 and first Latina \u2013 elected as county judge in Texas\u2019 Harris County in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing other characters come to life,\u201d Ventura said."

        "article_content": "There is a massive transformation happening in the financial services industry due to technological advancements and evolving consumer expectations. Key to this transformation has been advances in financial software development as companies innovate, improve operational efficiencies and create better customer experiences. In response to these trends, an article has been developed to take a deep dive into the major breakthroughs defining financial software development and unearthing more upon highlights on how developments in this niche affects global industries.\n\nThe Rise of Fintech Solutions\n\nWith a machine-like version of human oversight, the financial services industry has been transformed by disruptive fintech (financial technology). Fintech companies are using very advanced tech-enabled tools to change the way banking and financial services work, with innovative products that meet consumer needs today.\n\nMobile Banking and Payments\n\nConsumers and businesses of all sizes can benefit, as mobile banking & payment solutions have changed the way people interact with financial services. Users can manage and control their finances, make payments & transfers if they need be and access traditional banking services on their cellphones via these applications.\n\nLately we\u2019re seeing all our favorite payment apps such as Venmo, PayPal and Cash App explode in popularity. Similarly, traditional banks have also gone mobile with apps like Chase Mobile or Bank of America Mobile Banking.\n\nDigital Wallets\n\nDigital wallets are one more sort of fintech that has in a lot of ways changed the economic landscape. They are secure wallets that store payment details and allow you to pay for stuff without cash or using your pocket card with a simple tap.\n\nOther than the fact they work, Apple Pay and Google Wallet are pretty pedestrian \u2013 just another digital wallet to use side-by-side with traditional payment methods.\n\n1) AI and ML\n\nIn financial app development, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are acting as a spine. Initiatives are using these technologies to improve everything from customer service in financial services and insurtech, through to risk management.\n\nCustomer-Centric Engagement. Financial institutions can now capitalize on AI and ML to provide customers with bespoke experiences, by utilizing an abundance of data reservoirs that the solution solutions analyze, in order to understand individual liking or dislike patterns. This customization makes for happier and returning customers.\n\nArtificial Intelligence-Powered Chatbots for Instant Customer Support and Product Recommendations Credit unions, along with traditional banks and fintech companies deploy chatbots powered by AI to provide instant customer support and query responses; leverage data analytics capabilities using the user\u2019s financial history or behavioral analysis laying down personalized product recommendations.\n\nFraud Detection and Risk Management. Vendors are employing AI and ML for better fraud prevention and risk management as well. Real-time transaction pattern analysis- These technologies monitor transactions as they occur and detect any anomalies indicative of fraudulent activities.\n\nBy using machine learning algorithms, credit card companies better recognize unusual purchasing behavior and high probability fraud which could help to prevent unwanted transactions protecting the general public.\n\n2) Blockchain and Cryptocurrency\n\nIn financial software development, both blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have paved the way for new trends. This will bring novel options in transaction execution, value storage and financial operation security/ transparency.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) is a blockchain-based form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges or banks. DeFi platforms allow for users to lend, borrow, trade and invest in a decentralized fashion.\n\nAs a result, platforms like Uniswap, Compound and Aave have gained popularity allowing users to perform financial activities without need for traditional middlemen. Using smart contracts for securing and executing transactions across various platforms.\n\nCryptocurrencies and Digital Assets\n\nCryptocurrencies and digital assets are going more mainstream every year as they get increasingly adopted by financial institutions (now including PayPal), consumers, and even institutional investors. More recently, fintech development concentrates on building products with cryptocurrency support and secure storage to help things like crypto transactions.\n\nThere are many excellent places where you can buy and sell bitcoin, but Coinbase or Binance offer a fast way to get started compared to other options. Families of traditional financial institutions are also checking out the water in a splash, matured enough over blockchain technology space to innovate their workflow and onboard new products.\n\n3) Cloud computing\n\nCloud computing and API integration are the key trends driving modern software for financial services. They help financial institutions to streamline their operations, as well as secure and provide services with the latest technologies.\n\nFinancial companies can greatly benefit from cloud computing, since with the help of easily deployable and scalable hybrid, public or private cloud applications their business will be more competitive. Cloud-based solutions also mean easy to update and maintain, so that financial software solutions always remain secure and current.\n\nOne trend that we are witnessing is banks & financial institutions moving their core banking systems to the cloud and accessing services such as AWS, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure for bolstering IT infrastructure of these enterprises.\n\n4) API Integration\n\nAn API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of accessible requests that all software systems can use to communicate and work together. Among other use cases in financial services, APIs facilitate the integration of different applications and enable access to external third-party solutions or features.\n\nThe API for open banking allows third party developers to create applications and services around the financial institution. This enables innovation and greater consumer choice, leading to more competition in financial products.\n\nConclusion\n\nFinancial software development landscape emerging rapidly, the financial development environment is being elastically conformed over several innovations in fintech, advancements of AI and ML technology blocks like blockchain tech notably also driving adoption side-by-side with cloud technologies empowering these API-first approaches. Technologies needed to realize these trends are changing the dynamics of financial services making room for new businesses and experiences. After all, financial institutions that side with these trends will be able to compete effectively and keep pace with evolving consumer expectations in the new digital era. With the industry continuously changing, businesses that stay agile with these trends will perform better on this fast-paced financial landscape."

        "article_content": "Last week, I was in Berlin with the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold at the very start of my review period, and I wanted to write something about the camera ahead of it. I decided to do so by indulging in a photographic hobby of mine.\n\nWhen I travel, I like to take photos of cars, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was going to be my companion. It had better be up to the task, as other phones were waiting in the wings if it let me down.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nCar-spotting in Berlin\n\nDespite the Pixel 9 Pro Fold having Pro in its name, it does not have the same camera as the Pixel 9 Pro or even the Pixel 9. It has a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5MP wide-angle camera, and a 10.8MP telephoto camera for a 5x optical zoom. It\u2019s essentially the same as the Google Pixel Fold\u2019s camera setup, and on a technical level, it\u2019s not as impressive as the far less expensive (but much less foldy) Pixel 9 Pro or even the Pixel 8 Pro.\n\nBut would it do what I wanted while in Berlin? I was in the city for the IFA 2024 technology trade show, and I stayed in close proximity to Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (or Ku\u2019damm for short), which is central, elegant, and packed with lovely places for coffee and food. It\u2019s also full of expensive designer stores, luxury watch brand boutiques, and all the cars accompanying those who shop there. Over the many years I\u2019ve stayed in this area, I\u2019ve always enjoyed some casual car-spotting, often to the chagrin of my colleagues.\n\nI\u2019m a car geek, so when I\u2019m in new places, I find it really enjoyable to spot cars I don\u2019t usually see at home. What makes Kurf\u00fcrstendamm enjoyable for me is the variety of cars you see cruising and parked up, ranging from supercars to modern classics in fantastic condition.\n\nA good car-spotting camera needs to take colorful, high-contrast, dynamic photos in all lighting conditions to highlight the metal. It really needs a telephoto camera, so you don\u2019t have to get right up close to the vehicle when taking a photo, keeping things more incognito. It also needs a robust editing suite and a big screen to make adjustments. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold should be a great choice, so how did it do?\n\nUsing the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera\n\nOver the few days I was in Berlin, I took around 50 photos of different cars with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold \u2014 and I loved the results, regardless of whether I used the main, wide, 5x telephoto camera, or even the 2x non-optical zoom. I was consistently impressed with the speed of the camera, too, and although I didn\u2019t take many photos of cars on the move (more on that in a moment), I never missed a shot due to the camera or app being too slow.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t I take photos of cars on the move? I had intended to try out Google\u2019s Action Pan mode, which adds a cool motion blur effect to moving objects, as I\u2019d enjoyed it on the Pixel 9 and Pixel 8. However, oddly, Action Pan is missing from the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera app. Action Pan\u2019s sister mode, Long Exposure, is present though. There\u2019s no obvious technical reason why it\u2019s not included, and in this case, it was rather frustrating. Perhaps it\u2019ll turn up in a future software update.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 4 Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster. 5x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes Maybach S680. 5x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-AMG GT. Main camera Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz AMG G63. Wide-angle Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nWhat about the cars? It\u2019ll come as no surprise that two leading car brands dominate the Ku\u2019damm landscape: Mercedes Benz and Porsche. Porsches of all types are so prevalent that I stopped taking photos of 911s, as I\u2019d have spent most of my time capturing them if I hadn\u2019t done so.\n\nI didn\u2019t do the same with Mercedes as, despite seeing so many, the models were often highly unusual spots for me, as Ku\u2019dammers seem to love their high-performance Mercs. That said, on one day, the first five cars I considered photographing were all AMG GT models of various types, giving you an idea of how prevalent this particular car was in the area.\n\nThe cars and photos\n\nI didn\u2019t want to fixate on just supercars either, and I wanted to illustrate the variety of cars I saw, which I think speaks to the interesting car culture that I assume exists in Berlin and its surroundings. The convertible Mustang was a surprise, and although I didn\u2019t get photos as most were on the move when I saw them, the amount of Aston Martin and Jaguars, both new and old, illustrated that it wasn\u2019t solely about German cars either. Ferrari was notable in its absence, and the few I did see were easily outnumbered by Lamborghini and Bentley models. It was fantastic to see all these cars out and in use, particularly during the week.\n\nThe beautiful weather during my stay no doubt helped people bring out cars that may have otherwise been safely garaged, and it also helped out with my photos, as did the urban backdrop. I tried to incorporate Ku\u2019damm and its side streets into the photos, but there were times when a bit too much of it got in the way, and this is where the Pixel 9 Pro Fold became the ultimate companion for my car-spotting adventures on the move. For a start, opening the phone to view and then edit images on the large screen is amazing, and it simply can\u2019t be matched on a non-folding phone. Only editing on a laptop or tablet can compare, and I can carry neither in my pocket.\n\nPrevious Next 1 of 6 1967 Ford Mustang Convertible.

Main camera Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Mercedes-Benz S Class. 2x zoom Andy Boxall / Digital Trends Before Magic Editor Andy Boxall / Digital Trends\n\nOn the open screen I was able to make full use of Google Photos\u2019 Magic Editor mode, and wow, did it do some impressive things. My favorite is the wide-angle photo of the Mustang, which was interrupted by a street sign and some of the rental scooters that litter Berlin\u2019s streets when I took it.\n\nAmazingly, after a few careful swipes, Magic Editor took them all away without a trace. If I didn\u2019t point it out and show you the before image, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever realize. It also turned a photo I\u2019d have probably discarded into one I really like. I did the same with the background in the photo of the beautiful R129 SL, then removed the parked cars on either side of the white S Class, and was astonished by the clean, seamless result.\n\nNot a car-spotter?\n\nThis isn\u2019t our review of the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold or its camera, so all the photos you see here have been edited on the device using the tools found in Google Photos. Magic Editor has become incredibly adept at removing small distractions and re-creating backgrounds perfectly, and cleaning up the photos took just a few moments.\n\nBut I only wanted to edit the photos because they looked excellent to begin with, meaning I could tweak them to my taste rather than use the tools to try to reach an acceptable baseline. I\u2019ve managed to create a collection of photos I am really happy with that captures Berlin\u2019s obvious love of very powerful cars.\n\nWhen I came up with the idea of using car-spotting as the basis for my story on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold while in Berlin, it was with some trepidation. I take these photos for myself and fun, so I didn\u2019t want that to change. If the Pixel 9 Pro Fold was a pain or didn\u2019t take the pictures I wanted, it would become an effort and effectively become work, with all the fun of car photography removed.\n\nThis didn\u2019t happen because the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a joy to hold and use. It\u2019s not annoyingly heavy, the software has been faultless, and I never wanted to reach for the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max I also had with me to take a photo. I enjoyed my occasional hobby of photographing cool cars I spot just as much, if not more than usual, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold as my camera and Magic Editor at the ready.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never taken a photo of a car and are wondering if all this is relevant to you, all the same principles and performance of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\u2019s camera and Google Photos apply to whatever you\u2019re photographing. I love the open screen when I want to see my photos after taking them, and the telephoto camera allows me to shoot my chosen subject in more visually exciting ways from a distance. The editing toolkit helped me easily create photos I wish had been possible in real life.\n\nRegardless of what you want to take photos of, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a great companion. My first few days with the phone and its camera have left me smitten, and it\u2019s looking like the start of a very positive review."
