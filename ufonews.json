        "article_content": "Game Theory: UFO 50 is a massive trove of twists on old-school gaming genius Scroll until you find a title that sounds cool; you may hit something that'll be one of your favorite games of 2024.\n\nWhen approaching a video game project like Mossmouth\u2019s new release UFO 50\u2014an absolutely massive labor of love that is brilliant, frustrating, fun, mysterious, artistically ambitious, and sometimes just really fucking frustrating\u2014it helps to start from base principles. So: UFO 50, released on Steam this week, is a collection of 50 games of varying length and complexity, all purportedly from a fictional 1980s video game developer called UFOSoft. The games in the collection, which are presented in a fake chronological order built around the loosely sketched history of the company, largely draw their inspirations from the library of the Nintendo Entertainment System; amidst more esoteric or complicated pastiches, you can find games that serve as fairly straight homages to River City Rampage, Uninvited, Solar Jetman, Dragon Quest, and many more. There are meta elements operating to the side of the main draw\u2014notes on the games\u2019 fake development, a terminal that lets you go digging for secrets, markers that indicate when you\u2019ve completed individual titles\u2014but the focus has clearly been put on the games themselves, which were developed (in our world) by the Mossmouth team, including Spelunky creator Derek Yu.\n\nThe obvious comparison point for all this, at least for nerds of a certain vintage, will be clear: Cult Nintendo DS title Retro Game Challenge (and its sadly never-exported-from-Japan sequel), which pulled this same basic \u201cfake games from fake consoles from a fake past\u201d conceit back in 2007. Players who come to UFO 50 looking for a direct recreation of that experience might come away a little disappointed, though: Where that game prided itself on building up the fiction surrounding its faux games, complete with fake manuals and fake magazines for players to peruse in between playing its riffs on Mario or Galaga, UFO 50 is a bit more barebones in its presentation. (You get a few sentences of notes per game, and that\u2019s about it.) Given a choice between putting their emphasis on the games, or on the materials surrounding them, the small Mossmouth team understandably focused on function over form; we might wish for a more lush package, but it honestly feels churlish to complain, when the actual content of the collection is far more expansive than we\u2019ve had time to even come close to coming to terms with.\n\nAs to that content: We wish we could declare each of UFO 50\u2032s 50 games a retro-indie masterpiece, each one preserving what worked from classic game design while jettisoning the chaff, but, uh\u2026 No. Don\u2019t get us wrong: There are extremely good games in here, some more than worth the collection\u2019s $25 asking price all on their own. (We have lost too many hours this past week already to arena shooter Overbold, or mechanically gorgeous dungeon crawler Valbrace.) But many of the games in the collection feel torn between their desire to stay true to the clunky, frequently unfair controls of console ages past, and being genuinely fun games. Yes, it feels authentic that Barbuta, the very first game in the collection, happily wipes your progress every time you lose all your lives, erasing what could be 20 minutes of very fussy trap and dungeon navigation. Whether it\u2019s fun is a much thornier question.\n\nBut while we can\u2019t champion UFO 50 as 50 instant masterpieces, we also can\u2019t paint it with the broad brush of being uniformly old-school ornery for its old sake\u2014or a nostalgia exercise with no appeal for players who didn\u2019t grow up pulling battered NES carts off the rental wall of their local video store. The truth is that this really is 50 different games, each with their own control schemes and design hooks, and the quality is inevitably going to vary. Part of the fun of the package, in fact, is in that kind of discovery: For every game you play five minutes of before concluding \u201cEh, not for me,\u201d you\u2019re just as likely to run into something like the boldly strange Mooncat, or \u201cWhat if we\u2019d invented tower defense games on the NES\u201d hypothetical Rock On! Island. At the bare minimum, each title has something genuinely clever powering it, whether it\u2019s Mortol\u2018s attempt to build an action game out of Lemmings DNA, or Avianos\u2018 bird-based war gaming. Half the time, when we caught ourselves thinking \u201cOkay, we get it, let\u2019s move on\u201d after poking around at a game, we turned out to be basically right; the other half, though, we inevitably stumbled into some new secret or twist of play that deepened the experience of an individual title.\n\nUFO 50 is, in other words, a game that trusts you, the player, to find the fun\u2014with the promise that there is a lot of fun to be found in this odd, massive toy chest. We should note that the game does have a few curation tools\u2014if you scroll down to the bottom of the collection, you can filter games by whether they\u2019re meant to be more reflex based, or cerebral, for instance, or focus in on the title\u2019s large number of same-screen multiplayer games. (Breaking free of the chronology is a good idea in any case; although UFO 50 doesn\u2019t pay as much attention to the \u201ccomplexity increases as fictional time passes\u201d conceit that powered Retro Game Challenge, you\u2019ll still tend to find more robust experiences closer to the end of UFOSoft\u2019s fictional lifespan.) We\u2019re sure we\u2019ll soon see a cottage industry of guides and wider critiques pointing out hidden gems buried in its library. But honestly, we recommend just doing what the game itself advises: Scroll through until you find a title that sounds cool, blow off the fictional dust, and take a gamble on the chance you\u2019ll hit something that\u2019ll be one of your favorite games of 2024."

The most recent Pentagon report seems to conclude that most of the sightings people have witnessed haven't necessarily been related to extraterrestrials. Instead, these \"craft\" were likely connected to secret projects by groups and governments right here on Earth. The phone call is coming from inside the house.\n\nNo matter what you believe about the nature of \"flying saucers,\" there is one sighting labeled the \"most convincing\" UFO encounter in history. According to CBC, the Falcon Lake incident in Canada is being called the \"best-documented UFO case\" 50 years after the actual event.\n\nThe story has been covered in books and shows, including Unsolved Mysteries at one point, but it originates from May 1967 in the Falcon Lake woods in Manitoba, Canada. \"I recalled seeing him in bed. He didn't look good at all. He looked pale, haggard,\" Stan Michalak said about his father. \"When I walked into the bedroom there was a huge stink in the room, like a real horrible aroma of sulphur and burnt motor. It was all around and it was coming out of his pores. It was bad.\"\n\nMichalak was only a nine-year-old at the time but has detailed the incident as co-author of When They Appear, a book written with UFO researcher Chris Rutkowski. The book came out in 2017, but recently resurfaced due to coverage online at outlets like Daily Star.\n\nAccording to the account, Stefan Michalak was in the woods when he encountered a pair of \"cigar-shaped objects\" nearby, changing hues while floating before taking a disc shape. Michalak started drawing what he saw, which made their way online years later, before trying to get closer to the object.\n\n\"He couldn't make out any words, or anything, but he heard at least two beings communicating inside. He called out, offering mechanical help if they needed it,\" the It Gets Weird podcast recently detailed. \"As soon as he touches the craft, the fingertips just start to melt, so it's so hot that it literally melts the gloves he's wearing...He's hit by this blast of air, that pushes him backward and sets his shirt and hat on fire. He's stumbling backward, getting pushed by this wave of air and gas, and trying to take this burning shirt and hat off.\"\n\nThe account goes on to say he showed symptoms of radiation sickness and had \"severe burns\" on his torso that look like a grate or Bingo card. Once released from the hospital, he returned to the locale to recover his \"charred shirt, a melted glove and tools he'd left behind.\" He maintained his story until dying in 1999, never saying he encountered little green men either."

DOI: 10.3389/fmars.2024.1394695\n\nA team of oceanographers and marine biologists from the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center and Oregon State University has identified a mysterious noise heard in the Pacific Ocean for two decades as the sounds of Bryde's whales.\n\nIn their study published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, the group identified the sound and worked with a team at Google to develop an AI application that could be used to track the whales' movements.\n\nThe mysterious sound was first recorded in 2014, when its metallic ping was designated a \"biotwang.\" Since then, the sound has been recorded multiple times in multiple locations. In 2016, a team at Oregon State University found evidence that it was most likely some type of baleen whale.\n\nIn this new effort, the research team found that the earlier finding was correct\u2014the sound is emitted by Bryde's whales.\n\nThe research team was able to make the connection while surveying whales around the Mariana Islands, where they spotted several of the seldom-seen whales. As they continued their survey, they lowered microphones into the water and recorded the mysterious biotwangs simultaneously with nine more Bryde's whales' sightings, confirming that they were the source.\n\n\"Western Pacific Biotwang.\" Credit: Oregon State University, Sharon Nieukirk\n\nThe researchers then teamed up with a group at Google that was working on an AI app to identify whale vocalizations. After much training, the app was able not only to identify the calls of eight whale species, including Bryde's, but to also show where they lived and swam.\n\nThe results from the app showed that in addition to living near the Mariana Islands, the whales also spent a lot of time in what is known as the Pacific Ocean transition zone\u2014a boundary where warm and cool water meet, leading to the growth of huge populations of plankton. This provides the whales with a sure source of food. The finding is likely to open new avenues of research surrounding the Bryde's whales and perhaps to explain why their songs are so unique.\n\nMore information: Ann N.

        "article_content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Future\n\nThough there are some pretty interesting uses of AI out in the world, one of the absolute worst (outside of making terribly glossy pictures of Shrimp Jesus) is using AI bots to farm followers on X (or Twitter if you're normal).\n\nThanks to the incredibly smart decision to make verification a paid service, and an instant algorithm boost, viral tweets are often inundated with copy-and-paste tweets stolen from other non-verified accounts to take that attention away. When you factor in that 'creators' on \"the everything app\" are financially incentivised to hog that spotlight due to a shared advertising pool, the bot problem just gets worse. But one social media app leans into this hard by only giving you bots to interact with, and I've decided to test it out.\n\nSocialAI is an app where you create an account on a fake social media filled with bot accounts, intended to interact with you endlessly. It's effectively a chatbot with extra steps, and it's just as creepy as it sounds in practice. To be honest, it's left me pretty happy for my online life not to be filled with the din of social discourse. It's okay not to be one of the super popular.\n\nThough the idea itself isn't bad, in a social experiment kind of way, and I was intrigued almost immediately after reading Ars Technica's report on it. I came out the other side of this app feeling like an omnipotent god over a kingdom I loathe. Even critics and cynics are yes men, and suddenly, I understand the point of Noah's Ark. Sometimes, you just need to reset, and there's not enough room on the boat for all these bots.\n\nSocialAI is currently exclusively available on the Apple App Store. Announced via a post on X, creator Michael Sayman stated that it is \"designed to help people feel heard, and to give them a space for reflection, support, and feedback that acts like a close-knit community.\" After time with it, I came away feeling the opposite. I felt like I wasn't heard and my thoughts were instead put into a digital black box filled with advice and comments that could be scraped from articles and videos across the web.\n\nSocialAI\n\nWhen I asked it to recommend a gaming PC capable of handling Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's system requirements, many of its bots replied with some variation of an RTX 30 series card and an i7 chip. One account named Bella Sunshine said \"Any build is gonna be awesome if it runs smooth\" which is so circular I can't quite understand it. A gaming PC capable of running the game will run the game capably.\n\nSee, when you first sign up on the app, you have to say what types of followers you like, from supporters and fans to critics and pessimists. These all respond in kind to your posts and you will be able to spot which is which, based on cutesy names. Ms Sunshine above is an optimist, and all other optimists have similarly flowery names.\n\nTo unlock trolls, haters, drama queens, and political accounts, you have to get five other people to sign up for SocialAI\u2014like some sort of strange bot-infested pyramid scheme. Unfortunately, what illusion of interactivity you may be able to conjure from your own posts is dashed by canned answers and obvious archetypes. This is before mentioning that it always gives you even amounts of each bot's engagement. I chose five types of followers initially and every post was then met with replies in groupings of five.\n\nWith SocialAI intended to be somewhere to feel heard, I thought it necessary to bring harder questions so I said I was feeling depressed and looking for advice. @ShineWithLila suggested grabbing a cup of coffee with her, which immediately felt rather sad to me. Maybe I could've been the kind of isolated person who would've really benefited from a coffee date with a friend. But Lila couldn't be that friend.\n\nSocialAI is less a picture and more a tapestry. When you zoom out from the bots, you see an app that feels lonely and misguided. I'm not a particularly popular person on X but I do somehow manage to find joy out of social media (despite Elon's best efforts). I've never really minded if a post got zero replies, because I think this is what makes those that do reply feel that much more special. There's a human being on the other side of that phone or PC and they are giving some of their time to tell me my opinions on Star Wars sucks. That's what real connection is about.\n\nSocialAI is a smokescreen for a chatbot, intended to feed you the fantasy of being an influencer. It makes you feel suddenly really popular but ultimately, you know no one really cares. I'm sure this isn't what Plato envisioned with those shadows in his cave but I don't think I can sit there and watch them when the real world is happening mere tabs away from me. The flicker of light on the wall is so much dimmer than the crackle of humanity just inches outside."

        "article_content": "Paranormal experts have debunked the video supposedly showing \u2018ghost soldiers\u2019 at Gettysburg.\n\nYep, turns out that viral video everyone gets so obsessed with might not be all it seems. Greg Yuelling was previously visiting the Civil War battle site in Pennsylvania, US, when he captured the eerie clip.\n\n\u201cWe were driving along one night and we started hearing noises, I heard things to the left and my uncle heard things to the right, and there was a fog, but the fog was weird, it was only in one patch not dispersed,\" he explained\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThen we saw these shapes moving in the darkness, they were the size of humans, one of them ran right through the cannon.\"\n\nThe bloke watched the videos back and ended up pretty \u2018freaked out\u2019. It made him \u2018believe everything\u2019 as he was sure he\u2019d captured ghosts of the soldiers.\n\nBut when LADbible presented this footage to Help! My House is Haunted presenters Barri Ghai and Jayne Harris, it seems Yuelling may not have captured the figures after all.\n\nAdvert\n\nInvestigator and technical expert Ghai says he watched the video \u2018several times\u2019 before coming up with a \u2018logical explanation\u2019.\n\n\u201cThese are not spirits,\u201d he begins. \u201cDespite Gettysburg being rife with history and loads of paranormal stories over the years. I think what I'm seeing there is moisture on the windscreen.\u201d\n\nHe reckons they were ghosts. (SWNS)\n\nYeah, pretty underwhelming. Ghai explains that the video seems to be from inside the car and it appears to be foggy.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThere's definitely moisture that seems to be running down the face of the windscreen,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I think it's a combination of the environmental factors and what he's actually seeing through the mist and the fog.\u201d\n\nAnd historian and psychologist Harris agrees that as amazing as the video seems in such a historical location, there\u2019s just \u2018too many environmental factors\u2019 involved.\n\n\u201cIt looks brilliant,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a good, impressive clip but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ghost.\u201d But Harris does appreciate it\u2019s pretty disappointing for investigators to be sceptical about this type of stuff.\n\n\u201cWe see so many photographs and video clips, and especially, obviously now with mobile phones and these, you know, people are recording their own things all the time,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvert\n\nGhai and Harris know what they're on about. (discovery+)\n\nWell, there you have it, those \u2018ghosts\u2019 at Gettysburg aren\u2019t really ghosts \u2013 at least not in that video anyway.\n\nIf you do want to see Ghai and Harris in action with what they believe to actually be ghosts and spirits, a new season of Help! My House is Haunted just started streaming on discovery+. It sees the pair, along with psychic medium and exorcist, Ian Lawman, \u2018go above and beyond to solve some of the most chilling and challenging cases ever documented on TV\u2019.\n\nSeries six of Help! My House is Haunted airs on Really, Fridays at 9pm. Also available to stream on discovery+."

        "article_content": "Found footage movies have become synonymous with horror, and for good reason. I\u2019ve always felt that the raw, unpolished style of these movies makes them feel more visceral, as if they\u2019re happening in real-time. Of course, the shaky camera work and amateur-looking footage might not be for everyone, but there\u2019s something chilling about watching this kind of movie, and what better time to experience one with Halloween around the corner.\n\nFor those who want to experience this incredibly tense subgenre, I've rounded up five of the best found footage movies currently available to stream on some of the best services. So, grab your late-night snacks and get ready to watch true terror on the small screen. Note: you might not be able to sleep after watching some of these, because I certainly couldn't.\n\n'Host' (2020)\n\nHost - Official Trailer [HD] | A Shudder Original - YouTube Watch On\n\nScreen-capture-style movies where most of the story takes place through the computer\u2019s webcam have usually always flopped. Take the likes of \"Unfriended\" and \"Friend Request\" for example, which are entertaining enough to watch, but the execution and character development aren't great. One movie in this subgenre that does exceed is \"Host\", a tense horror set (and made) during the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\n\"Host\" follows a group of six friends who decide to conduct a virtual s\u00e9ance over Zoom. Seeking a unique way to pass the time, they hire a medium to guide them through the session. However, things quickly take a dark turn when one of the friends disrespects the process by pretending to make contact with a fake spirit. This action opens the door for an actual malevolent entity to invade their call.\n\nOf course, as you can probably guess, the supernatural force begins to haunt each participant, manifesting terrifying events in their own homes. The entire movie plays out through the Zoom call, making you feel like you are part of the group\u2019s increasingly desperate struggle to survive the night.\n\nWatch on Shudder\n\n'Cloverfield' (2008)\n\nCloverfield (2008) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers - YouTube Watch On\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be right if I didn\u2019t include \"Cloverfield\" on this list considering it was one of the very first found footage movies I ever saw. This thrilling story has everything you need to have a good time \u2014 a giant alien creature and a group of characters who have no idea what they\u2019re doing.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

The movie begins at a going-away party, where Rob (Michael Stahl-David), the main character, is preparing to move to Japan. His friends are documenting the event on a handheld camera when suddenly, a massive explosion rocks the city.\n\nThe group quickly realizes they are in the middle of a large-scale disaster as a gigantic creature wreaks havoc, destroying buildings and causing widespread panic. The great thing about this is that it\u2019s presented entirely through the footage captured on a handheld camera, meaning you're up close and personal with the action.\n\nWatch on Paramount Plus\n\n'Rec' (2007)\n\n[Rec] (2007) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers - YouTube Watch On\n\nA movie that uses handheld camera work and real-time events to create a claustrophobic, immersive experience will always be highly regarded in my books. And one such movie includes \"Rec,\" which isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted (honestly, this one really scared me).\n\nThis Spanish found footage horror follows a television reporter, \u00c1ngela Vidal (Manuela Velasco), and her cameraman, Pablo (Pablo Rosso), as they document the night shift at a local fire station. When they are called to a routine emergency at an apartment building, they find themselves trapped inside with a group of residents.\n\nHowever, it becomes clear that something sinister is going on. The residents start exhibiting strange and violent behavior, and the situation quickly escalates into a full-blown nightmare. The building is soon sealed off by the authorities, and \u00c1ngela and Pablo are forced to confront the horrifying truth: A mysterious infection has spread through the building, turning people into rabid, zombie-like creatures.\n\nWatch on Tubi\n\n'Creep' (2014)\n\nCreep Official Trailer 1 (2015) - Mark Duplass Horror Movie HD - YouTube Watch On\n\nFor anyone who enjoys slow-burn tension that leads to a disturbing and shocking climax, then \"Creep\" should be your next weekend watch. It's notable for its minimalistic approach since it mainly focuses on just two characters and how they interact.\n\n\"Creep\" follows a freelance cameraman named Aaron (Patrick Brice) who responds to a Craigslist ad for a one-day film job. The ad was placed by Josef (Mark Duplass), a man who claims he has a terminal illness and wants to make a video diary for his unborn child.\n\nAs Aaron films Josef, he quickly becomes unsettled by Josef's increasingly strange and unsettling behavior. Josef's requests grow more bizarre and invasive, and Aaron begins to suspect that something is seriously wrong. The moment when Josef's true nature and intentions are revealed definitely makes this movie worth watching.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n'Paranormal Activity' (2007)\n\nPerhaps one of the most well-known (yet somehow most underrated) found footage movies is \"Paranormal Activity.\" I made the mistake of watching it when I was younger, and it haunted me for days. That didn\u2019t stop me from appreciating it and \"Paranormal Activity\" definitely ranks as one of the best found footage movies ever.\n\nIt revolves around a young couple, Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat), who have recently moved into a new home. Katie believes that she is being haunted by a supernatural entity, and the couple decides to document the eerie occurrences using a video camera.\n\nAs the days go by, the disturbances grow stranger. The couple sets up the camera to record while they sleep, hoping to capture evidence of the haunting. What they discover in the footage reveals increasingly sinister and supernatural activities occurring in their home, including strange noises, objects moving on their own and disturbing events that escalate over time.\n\nWatch on Max"

This discovery significantly expands our understanding of how genetic mutations can lead to cancer, a disease typically triggered by changes in our genetic code that disrupt cell growth regulation. The research team used advanced algorithms to detect anomalies in the genetic code related to exons\u2014segments of a gene that directly translate into proteins.\n\nMethodology\n\nNew approach to understanding cancer-causing genes\n\nThe BIST team's research differs from previous studies that primarily focused on abnormalities within the DNA itself. Instead, this study examined anomalies that occur as instructions from DNA are transmitted to the rest of the body. The non-coding sections of a gene, known as introns, are usually removed when a gene's DNA is transcribed into an RNA version in a process called splicing. Cancer cells can disrupt this splicing process to produce mutated proteins from an otherwise normal protein gene.\n\nDiscovery\n\nIdentification of potential cancer-promoting genes\n\nThe BIST team used sophisticated algorithms to identify 813 genes that could potentially promote cancer growth when spliced. This discovery significantly expands the existing list of known cancer-causing genes, which previously included only 626 genes known to cause tumors when mutated. Interestingly, only about a 10th of these newly identified 'splice' class genes were already included in the most widely-used cancer mutation database, that records genes driving cancer growth through mutations.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nNew algorithm identifies potential cancer-driving exons\n\nThe research team developed an algorithm called Spotter, which was able to sift through vast amounts of genetic data to identify splicing events that may enhance cancer growth. In preliminary lab tests on tissue samples, targeting these exons effectively limited cancer growth. \"Not only can Spotter identify potential cancer-driver exons, which we can then trace back to genes, but it can also rank which exons are more important than others in any given cancer sample,\" says BIST biologist Miquel Anglada-Girotto.\n\nPrediction\n\nExon identification could predict patient drug responses\n\nThe study also found that identifying these exons could help predict how different patients might respond to the same drug. This discovery opens up new possibilities for personalized cancer treatment strategies based on individual genetic profiles. While more research is needed before we can routinely identify and target exons within genes, this study shows promising potential for future cancer treatments."

Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nThe black hole is almost 5,825 light-years away from Earth\n\nAstronomers discover smallest black hole lurking in Milky Way\n\nBy Akash Pandey 03:33 pm Sep 21, 202403:33 pm\n\nWhat's the story Astronomers led by Song Wang from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, have discovered an unusual celestial phenomenon, potentially the smallest black hole ever detected. The discovery was made approximately 5,825 light-years away from Earth, where a red giant star was observed moving in a slow orbital dance with an invisible binary companion. The team named this intriguing find as G3425.\n\nInvisible companion\n\nG3425's invisible companion: A potential black hole\n\nThe red giant star's invisible binary companion, part of the G3425 system, has sparked interest due to its lack of light emission. Wang's team analyzed the behavior of the red giant and determined that this unseen object has a mass approximately 3.6 times that of our Sun. This led them to conclude that it could be a black hole, specifically one small enough to fit into an unexplained void in data known as the lower mass gap.\n\nTheoretical challenge\n\nG3425 challenges current theories of binary evolution\n\nThe discovery of G3425 has significant implications for our understanding of small black holes. \"The rare discovery of G3425 provides evidence for the existence of mass-gap black holes in non-interacting binaries, which is hard to detect through X-ray emission,\" stated the researchers in their paper. They further noted that \"the formation of its surprisingly wide circular orbit challenges current binary evolution and supernova explosion theories.\"\n\nFormation process\n\nUnderstanding the formation and nature of black holes\n\nBlack holes are ultra-dense objects that form from the remnant cores of dead stars, after they run out of fuel and collapse under gravity. White dwarfs form from stars up to about eight times the mass of the Sun, with an upper mass limit of about 1.4 times the Sun's mass. Heavier objects become even more dense; these are neutron stars, up to around 2.3 solar masses (there can be a bit of overlap between the mass ranges).\n\nMass gap\n\nThe mystery of the 'mass gap' in black hole formation\n\nThe concept of a 'mass gap' arises from the observation that very few black hole candidates below five solar masses have been detected. This suggests either a difficulty in detecting them or an unknown factor preventing their formation. Unless they're actively growing \u2014 a process that creates X-radiation from the material swirling around the black hole under extreme gravitational influences \u2014 black holes are challenging to spot due to their non-emissive nature.\n\nDetection aid\n\nGaia mission aids in detecting invisible celestial objects\n\nThe European Space Agency's Gaia mission is proving instrumental in detecting such invisible celestial objects. The long-term project aims to map the Milky Way in three dimensions, including tracking stars' motions and velocities. This allows astronomers to identify stars that appear to be orbiting with no visible partner, leading to discoveries like G3425. Wang's team utilized spectroscopy from the Chinese Academy of Science's Large Aperture Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope and Gaia data for their groundbreaking find."

        "source": "The Denver Post",
        "article_content": "Josh Reynolds is a dagger expert.\n\nThat\u2019s \u201cdagger\u201d as in the NFL passing concept, of course.\n\nIn Detroit, Reynolds got all the glory on the play. Somebody else handled the clear-out vertical, running a safety down the field to create a void about 18-20 yards past the line of scrimmage, a couple of yards inside the numbers.\n\nThen Reynolds, lined up outside, would run a deep in-cut into that void, find the ball and make hay.\n\n\u201cThat was one of my routes, for sure. I was the dagger,\u201d Reynolds told The Denver Post.\n\nNow in Denver, he\u2019s the clear-out man. The ball never goes to that guy.\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019ve seen in eight years,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is the dirty work. Like an off-the-ball screen to free up a shooter in basketball or a rugged forward jostling for position in front of a goaltender in hockey.\n\n\u201cLove of the game route, man,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nCourtland Sutton is the Broncos\u2019 dagger man.\n\nHe starts outside of Reynolds when the Broncos run this tried-and-true zone-beater. Gets up the field, lets Reynolds do his thing, then snaps inside. During camp and the preseason, rookie quarterback Bo Nix showed an affinity for the play, hitting Sutton on his route in rhythm time and time again.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fast dude,\u201d Reynolds said of Sutton. \u201cHe\u2019s a fast dude that can stick his foot in the ground and come flat. That\u2019s the whole key to running dagger.\u201d\n\nSo far in the regular season, though, Denver\u2019s passing game has been blunted. Its production on dagger and Sutton\u2019s production as a whole? Duller than anticipated.\n\nSutton\u2019s got five catches on 16 targets through two games and just 64 yards. With a small sample size, one big game can turn those numbers around, but the early per-game and per-target rates are well off Sutton\u2019s career norms.\n\nMore pertinent so far is the general inability to get the ball into Sutton\u2019s hands in the first place. Nix targeted him 12 times in Week 1 at Seattle, but he finished with only four catches. Then against Pittsburgh, the ball didn\u2019t even get thrown in Sutton\u2019s direction until midway through the third quarter.\n\n\u201cThere are routes when he\u2019s primary and you\u2019re hoping that you catch the right look and he gets the throw. It doesn\u2019t always work like that,\u201d offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a big part of every game plan and sometimes the flow of the game is such that he doesn\u2019t get the throws like we thought he would.\u201d\n\nOf course, given the overall issues the Broncos have had offensively, nobody is off to a blazing start. But Sutton\u2019s pace out of the gates is noteworthy particularly because of his offseason \u2014 he skipped all voluntary team activities to advocate for a contract extension that never came \u2014 and because he looked terrific during training camp.\n\nNow, though, it\u2019s a struggle.\n\nNix has thrown three interceptions while targeting Sutton. The receiver could have been credited with a target on the final-play pick Nix threw against Pittsburgh, too.\n\n\u201cHe plays \u2018X\u2019, but he can play other spots,\u201d head coach Sean Payton said of Sutton. \u201cA lot of (the lack of production) gets back to the third downs. (Wednesday night) we\u2019ll be game-planning third down, and we have to be better in that area to add more snaps throughout the course of the game.\u201d\n\nIndeed, half of Sutton\u2019s targets so far have come on third down and on those snaps, Nix is 2 of 8 for 43 yards and a pick.\n\nLast year, Sutton caught eight of his 10 touchdowns in the red zone. Through two games this year: One catch on five targets for 10 yards, two interceptions and another that was nearly picked.\n\nSutton is a moneymaker in the intermediate part of the field. He\u2019s a big target and he\u2019s got the ability to create space, but he\u2019s not the type of receiver to flat run by a defensive back.\n\nDagger is a perfect example.\n\nNix has tried him on it three times already in two games. Against Seattle, Nix airmailed the first and then the second came up short because of pressure up the middle. Finally, against Pittsburgh, they got the look they wanted and Nix pinned a perfect ball on him for 26 yards.\n\nOverall, though, anything beyond 5 yards in the air has been inconsistent at best for Nix and the Denver offense.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s one thing,\u201d Lombardi said. \u201cI think it\u2019s everything working together \u2014 timing, protection routes. There\u2019s not one thing that goes into it. It\u2019s like most things on offense, it\u2019s 11 guys working together.\u201d\n\nUntil they do, Sutton will likely continue to operate in a kind of limbo.\n\nHe\u2019s in that mode career-wise, too.\n\nDenver added up to $1.5 million in incentives for him to end what he described as an offseason \u201cstalemate.\u201d If the Broncos\u2019 offense wallows, though, that\u2019s money he won\u2019t see much or any of.\n\nA recent under-the-radar move could impact his future roster status, too.\n\nDenver in Week 1 made Sutton more expensive to cut or trade after the season but also took a spring or summer extension off the table.\n\nTight on cap space but wanting to sign cornerback Pat Surtain II to a mega extension, the Broncos created room by converting $11.875 million of Sutton\u2019s $13 million base salary to signing bonus. Importantly, they also added three void years to his contract to maximize the cap savings in the short term.\n\nThat contract adjustment, though, means Sutton is now ineligible for an extension for a year due to a rule that says contracts can\u2019t be renegotiated more than once per 12 months.\n\nSo now Sutton carries a $20.2 million cap hit for 2025, per OvertheCap. The Broncos could save $6.875 million if they cut him after this season but would incur $13.325 million in dead cap, too. That\u2019s nearly $10 million more than before the contract adjustment and that prorated bonus money would stay on the books if the Broncos traded him, too.\n\nSimultaneously, though, the sides couldn\u2019t formalize a contract extension until the 2025 regular season even if they wanted to.\n\nThat will be more pertinent in January than it is now. For the moment, the focus is just on getting the Broncos\u2019 top receiver going.\n\nPerhaps it will start with a dagger.\n\nNot rating well\n\nCourtland Sutton has the lowest quarterback rating on passes when targeted this season among all receivers in the NFL with 10 or more targets through Week 2. Here\u2019s a look at how the Broncos receiver stacks up:\n\nPlayer Team Targets Catches Yards Ints QB rating Courtland Sutton Denver 16 5 64 3 5.2 Diontae Johnson Carolina 12 5 34 2 9.7 Tyler Boyd Tennessee 10 5 44 1 22.5 Michael Pittman Jr. Indianapolis 15 7 52 1 27.6 Elijah Moore Cleveland 14 9 53 2 31.8\n\n(Can\u2019t see chart in mobile?

Both have thousands of servers worldwide and boast high-speed streaming and download capacity without sacrificing security and privacy.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly hard to choose between these leading VPNs when the pricing is so close. I recently reviewed NordVPN and Proton VPN, so I\u2019ll share details about pricing and renewal costs, hands-on speed tests, and customer service responsiveness.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nUltimately, I\u2019ll share my recommendation for the best VPN to fit your budget while protecting your privacy and delivering consistently great performance.\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nStarting at the free tier, Proton VPN takes the lead with a full-featured app that can connect to 136 servers in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Japan. There\u2019s no data cap or artificial limits placed on speed. Proton VPN is among the best free VPNs with few restrictions. NordVPN doesn\u2019t have a free version.\n\nBoth offer a 30-day money-back guarantee but no trial period. That means you have to pay for a subscription to try the full version of either VPN. Each company supports 10 devices with paid service so you can use the VPN on all your devices and share with family members.\n\nNordVPN costs $13 per month, while Proton VPN comes in at $10 monthly. The best value comes with a longer subscription. NordVPN starts at $60 for the first year, but renews at $139.08. The equivalent monthly cost is $5 initially, but increases to $12 thereafter. A two-year subscription starts at $97 and includes three free months. That works out to $3.60 monthly, a great deal for 27 months. But watch out for the renewal cost, which skyrockets to $313.\n\nProton VPN has a less expensive $10 monthly plan and matches NordVPN\u2019s $60 annual subscription. The two-year plan costs $108. Proton doesn\u2019t charge more when you need to renew, so both monthly and renewal costs are better.\n\nBoth services have software bundles that add more features if you pay more.\n\nFeatures\n\nWhen I reviewed NordVPN, I was more than satisfied with its speed and reliability. I consistently enjoyed quick server connections and download speeds measuring 32% to 52% of my gigabit Ethernet connection. That\u2019s hundreds of megabits per second worldwide.\n\nAs impressive as NordVPN\u2019s performance was, Proton VPN nearly matched it by delivering 26% to 50% of my unprotected internet download speed. Proton VPN suffered from slow uploads, a common complaint with even the best VPNs.\n\nWhile NordVPN managed up to 29 Mbps uploads, the best I got with Proton VPN was 14 Mbps. To be fair, server connections are generally optimized for downloading content, with only a bit reserved to keep the connection responsive as you search and browse.\n\nBoth feature solid VPN connections to thousands of servers in over 100 countries. To get around administrative firewallls, NordVPN has the NordLynx protocol and Proton VPN has Stealth.\n\nSupport\n\nNordVPN has an advantage when it comes to customer service. You can search and browse the support center for help documents. If you run into a problem that you can\u2019t figure out on your own, NordVPN offers 24/7 live chat. I tested the response time and found it to be quick and informative.\n\nProton VPN provides live chat support for paid subscribers, but only during business hours. Still, you can get help quickly during a 15-hour window daily. I received fast and thorough replies to my questions. If you reach out when live chat is closed, Proton\u2019s support documents are available anytime.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nNordVPN prioritizes user privacy with a strict no-logs policy and no data sharing with third parties. Like all good VPNs, NordVPN uses end-to-end encryption to protect your data, as well as hides your IP address and location.\n\nProton VPN is open-source software with a privacy focus, a strict no-logs policy, and secure data storage practices. Proton was founded by CERN scientists in 2014 to ensure private communications and carries that mission forward with all its apps and services.\n\nBoth service get regular independent audits to check security and verify that no logs are retained. Your data should be secure and private with either VPN.\n\nWhich VPN is right for you?\n\nAs you can tell, NordVPN and Proton VPN are closely matched,with similar pricing and features. The primary difference is in pricing tiers. NordVPN offers more bundle variety, which might be appealing if you have particular needs that Proton VPN can\u2019t meet affordably.\n\nFor some people, Proton Free might be all they need. It\u2019s fast, free, and includes free versions of Proton VPN, Proton Mail, Proton Pass, and more.\n\nIf you need access to more servers, but for a limited time, Proton VPN\u2019s monthly fee is less expensive than NordVPN\u2019s. If you anticipate long-term use of a VPN, Proton VPN\u2019s consistent pricing when you renew means you\u2019ll continue saving when it comes time to renew your subscription.\n\nFor most people, Proton VPN is the best solution whether you use the free version or subscribe.\n\nIf neither solution seems like a good fit, there are plenty of fast and reliable VPNs to choose from. It\u2019s also worth checking out our list of VPN deals to see if you can save some money while protecting your privacy."

        "article_content": "A few years ago, a friend of mine was struggling to keep up with the growing demands of his small business. You see, every weekend, he\u2019d spend hours manually setting sports odds, taking calls from his dedicated clients, and recording options with a pen and paper. One particularly busy Sunday, after juggling a dozen calls at once and nearly missing a client\u2019s request, he realized he needed a better system. That\u2019s when he discovered pay per head software. Practically overnight, his operation transformed. With everything automated\u2014from odds management to online player accounts\u2014he was able to scale his business and compete with larger competitors, all while providing a seamless experience for his clientele. That shift marked the start of a new chapter, not just for him, but for sports agents everywhere, and it all came down to the power of technology.\n\nThe industry has undergone a technological revolution in recent years, with pay per head (PPH) software emerging as a powerful tool that is reshaping how smaller local agents operate. These platforms are empowering independent businesses by providing them with cutting-edge technology, which allows them to compete with larger, more established companies.\n\nWhat is Pay Per Head Software?\n\nAt its core, pay per head software is a service that enables sports agents to manage their operations digitally. Instead of handling phone requests, odds, and player figures manually, a PPH platform automates these processes. The agent pays a fee for each active customer\u2014hence the \u201cpay per head\u201d model. In return, they gain access to a fully functional, professional-grade software platform equipped with features like live in-game, prop builder and dynamic odds updates.\n\nThe scalability and affordability of PPH software have made it an attractive option for independent operators looking to modernize their business offering and provide their customers with a first rate user experience.\n\nThe Technology Behind the Software\n\nPPH software relies on several key technologies that make it both efficient and effective. Here are the critical components that make these platforms so transformative:\n\n1. Cloud Computing and Scalability\n\nOne of the major advantages of PPH software is that it is cloud-based, allowing for seamless scalability. Agents can handle a growing number of users without the need for significant upfront investment in infrastructure. Cloud servers automatically adjust to accommodate fluctuations in traffic, ensuring that the platform remains stable even during peak periods like major sporting events.\n\nThe cloud-based nature of PPH software also means that updates and maintenance can be done remotely, without requiring any downtime. This frees up the agent to run their operations smoothly with minimal technical issues.\n\n2. Real-Time Data Processing\n\nSpeed and accuracy are essential, and PPH software excels at both. These platforms use real-time data processing to provide up-to-the-second odds on various sporting events. This dynamic updating ensures that users are getting the most accurate information available, which is crucial to their experience.\n\nAdditionally, real-time data processing allows for the tracking of player activity instantly. This includes monitoring open positions, analyzing trends, and adjusting lines accordingly to manage risk. The ability to process vast amounts of data quickly is what provides the ability to stay competitive in a fast-paced environment.\n\n3. Automation and AI-Driven Analytics\n\nAutomation is at the heart of pay per head software. The platform automatically handles tasks such as managing player accounts, tracking wins and losses, and generating reports. This not only reduces the workload for agents but also minimizes the risk of human error.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, many advanced PPH systems are beginning to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to provide deeper insights into player behavior. AI-driven analytics can help to identify patterns, assess risk, and even predict future trends. By leveraging AI, agents can make more informed decisions, optimizing both profitability and player retention.\n\n4. Mobile Integration and User Experience\n\nToday\u2019s users demand mobile accessibility, and this software delivers. PPH platforms are designed with responsive, mobile-friendly interfaces that allow users to find sporting events, check odds, and manage their accounts from any device.\n\nThe user experience is central to the success of PPH. Many feature sleek, intuitive designs that make it easy for users to navigate and find options quickly. This focus on user experience not only enhances player satisfaction but also increases player retention, which is vital for agents looking to build a loyal customer base.\n\nThe Advantages for Sports Agents\n\nFor independent agents, pay per head software offers a host of benefits that are hard to ignore. Some of the most significant advantages include:\n\nCost Efficiency : With a simple pay per head fee structure, agents avoid the high costs of building and maintaining their own software infrastructure.\n\nFlexibility : PPH platforms offer a wide range of markets, from major sports like football and basketball to niche events like esports.\n\nRisk Management : Automated reporting and AI-driven analytics provide the tools needed to effectively manage risk and protect their bottom line.\n\nProfessionalism : Using a PPH platform elevates the sports agent\u2019s operation to a level that rivals established competitors, offering a professional experience to users.\n\nCustomizable Options : Pay per head platforms often allow agents to customize their offerings, tailoring the experience to their client\u2019s specific needs. Whether it\u2019s focusing on local sports, niche markets, or unique props, this flexibility enables an agent to stand out in a crowded marketplace and better cater to the preferences of their clientele.\n\n24/7 Customer Support : Many PPH services come with round-the-clock customer support for both the agent and their clients. This means that any technical issues or special inquiries can be resolved quickly, providing a seamless experience for users and reducing the operational burden on the agent.\n\nIncreased User Engagement : PPH platforms offer features like live in-game and real-time odds, which keep users more engaged and active. With exciting, up-to-the-minute options, agents can retain clients for longer periods, leading to increased activity and higher revenues over time.\n\nAs sports enthusiasm continues to grow globally, the demand for pay per head software is expected to increase. With advancements in AI, machine learning, and predictive analytics, PPH platforms will only become more sophisticated, giving sports agents deeper insights into user trends and behavior. Additionally, PPH services will continue to democratize the industry, allowing smaller operations to compete with larger companies on a level playing field."
