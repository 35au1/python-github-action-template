It\u2019s peeling back the layers of an onion,\u201d said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn.\n\n\u201cThe best pilots in the world, that are our pilots, are telling us that these things are flying in close proximity to their aircraft,\u201d Burchett told \u201cNewsNation Prime.\u201d\n\nWhat is the Pentagon\u2019s alleged \u2018Immaculate Constellation\u2019 program?\n\nOne expert from Great Britain who will be watching the hearing believes that we will learn something, but not everything.\n\n\u201cDisclosure is a process, rather than a single event. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see on Wednesday a sort of parting of the curtains \u2018this is it\u2019 definitive explanation,\u201d said Nick Pope, UFO expert and retired U.K. Defense Ministry official.\n\nAlso appearing on \u201cNewsNation Prime,\u201d Pope said he\u2019s especially looking forward to the testimony of former U.S. Navy Admiral Tim Gallaudet, who knows about a part of the UFO/UAP issue that many people have never heard about: underwater phenomena.\n\n\u201cThis \u2026 is extremely sensitive because some of these things have apparently been tracking our ballistic missile nuclear submarines,\u201d he said.\n\nMystery drones flew over US base\n\nBurchett agrees, adding that Gallaudet \u201chas very compelling evidence\u201d\n\nTwo subcommittees of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee are holding the Nov. 13 hearing titled \u201cUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.\u201d\n\nMany advocates of disclosure have high hopes for the new Trump administration when it comes to releasing files that have been secret for decades.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dropped heavy hints that he knows something,\u201d said Pope. \u201cHe\u2019s been pressured \u2026 to release the rest of the JFK files, which he says he\u2019s going to do early in his second term. Clearly in President Trump\u2019s mind, he links the UFO issue to the JFK issue \u2013 perhaps just in terms of public interest and the suggestion that there\u2019s a coverup and a conspiracy,\u201d Pope added.\n\nNetflix faces lawsuit over \u2018The Manhattan Alien Abduction\u2019\n\nBurchett is also optimistic that Trump wants to share more of what government agencies have compiled over the decades.\n\n\u201cI hope so.

        "article_content": "Netflix\u2019s \u2018Investigation Alien\u2019 delves into worldwide accounts of alleged UFO sightings and extraterrestrial encounters. Among these is a report from Council Bluffs, Iowa, dating back to December 1997. Locals claimed mysterious metal had fallen from the sky, with many suspecting it came from another world. However, Darrell Livengood offers a different perspective. He makes the argument that these claims are a hoax and presents a credible, logical explanation for what others believe to be genuine.\n\nDarrell Livengood Claimed He Could Explain the 1977 Sighting in Iowa\n\nIn December 1977, residents of Council Bluffs, Iowa, reported mysterious metal objects falling from the sky, sparking intrigue and speculation. Many witnesses described seeing a lava-like substance that solidified rapidly, embedded with blue shards. Resident Mike Moore explained that the blue fragments resembled glass from a 1950s-1960s camera but noted they didn\u2019t melt with the rest of the material. However, another resident, Darrell Livengood, shared a different perspective, recalling how he\u2019d returned from college for the holidays and gone out with three friends on December 17, 1977. Two of these worked for Union Pacific, and together, they decided to engage in some playful mischief.\n\nDarrell recounted that his friends had two tools they called \u201cchargers,\u201d which were actually similar to thermal welding devices. They decided to ignite them, and the resulting flame shot about 30 feet into the air, forming a smoke cloud that might have resembled a floating disc to onlookers. He added that the upward flame could have appeared to some as if it were moving downward. At the time, when people were collecting residue from the site, he and his friends remained silent, but over the years, he felt compelled to debunk the claims.\n\nDarrell insisted that the residue found at the site was nothing more than phosphorus and powder, supporting his claim that there was no mysterious or otherworldly explanation. Yet, when UFO journalist George Knapp took samples of the material for testing, an explosives chemist reported that the composition didn\u2019t match Darrell\u2019s account. According to the chemist, the substance couldn\u2019t have come from a thermal welding tool, as Darrell suggested. Despite the test results, Darrell remains firm in his version of events, convinced that nothing unusual occurred that day and that the incident was simply a misunderstanding rather than a supernatural encounter.\n\nDarrell Livengood is Leading a Fulfilling Life With His Wife Today\n\nDarrell Livengood is now happily settled in Surprise, Arizona, where he has crafted a fulfilling life surrounded by music, love, and a deep sense of gratitude. Darrell graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School and later pursued higher education at the University of Iowa. After finishing college, Darrell embarked on a steady, dedicated career as a rural letter carrier for the USPS, a position he held for many years. His job took him across rural landscapes, connecting him to countless communities. When he eventually retired from the USPS, he was not quite ready to slow down. Seeking a new challenge, Darrell decided to take up work operating forklifts, finding fulfillment in staying active and continuing to work with his hands. He remained in this role for some time, easing into retirement at his own pace.\n\nDarrell\u2019s journey brought him back together with Marlo Keifer, the love of his life. After living together for ten years, they parted ways, and each went on a separate path. Nineteen years later, they reconnected, rekindled their love, and got married on February 18, 2014. Marlo brought two daughters into their relationship, adding to the joy in their life together, and the couple now enjoys a peaceful, contented life. Though Darrell is retired, his passion for music remains unwavering. In 2014, he proudly released his first album, \u2018Erie Canal,\u2019 a collection that reflects his lifelong love for storytelling through song. Today, Darrell and Marlo savor the simple pleasures\u2014Darrell, with his guitar in hand, is grateful for the family, friends, and moments that have shaped his journey.\n\nRead More: Donald Schmitt: Where is the UFOlogist Now?"

        "article_content": "Were These Advanced US Aircraft a Source of UFO Sightings? public domain / wikimedia commons\n\nUFOs are now known as UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) to make their serious reporting and study more palatable to the American government and scientific community. But whatever they\u2019re called, there\u2019s no doubt that people have been seeing things in the sky that defy explanation for as long as recorded history. Sightings spiked in the 1950s and 60s, though, which just happened to be the same era the United States and other countries started testing some very unconventional aircraft. But if this explains some sightings, what does that tell us about what kinds of next-gen technology the military might be developing today?\n\n24/7 Wall St. Insights\n\nSome UFO reports over the past 70 years could be explained by people witnessing test flights of advanced U.S. military technology.\n\nThe capabilities of recent UAPs describe startling technology far beyond anything we\u2019ve seen so far. Could this indicate the U.S. or other countries are making exponential leaps in military technology?\n\nAlso: Discover \u201cThe Next NVIDIA\n\nFamous UAP Sightings:\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nBattle of Los Angeles (1942): Anti-aircraft guns fired over 1,400 shells at an unidentified object approaching the city that was initially thought to be a Japanese attack.\n\nAnti-aircraft guns fired over 1,400 shells at an unidentified object approaching the city that was initially thought to be a Japanese attack.

U.S. Navy Videos (2020): the Navy released videos of incidents in 2004 and 2015 in which pilots observed unidentified objects moving at extraordinary velocities and against strong winds with no resistance.\n\nOrdinary Explanations For UAPs\n\nAtosan / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile the attention of the general public tends to jump quickly to the conclusion that we are being visited by aliens, most UAPs can be explained in more prosaic ways:\n\nUnusual weather phenomena, such as ball lighting, earthquake lights, or city lights reflecting off of lenticular clouds.\n\nInstrument artifacts such as reflections, calibration problems, or mechanical defects that create an illusion of a real object.\n\nCivilian or military aircraft, including weather balloons, drones, flares released by aircraft in training exercises, or foreign military surveillance such as the infamous Chinese spy balloon that traversed the country before being shot down off the coast of Myrtle Beach, SC.\n\nMass hysteria or other psychological factors in some of the people who allege sightings.\n\nDeliberate hoaxes as simple as teenage pranks or as calculating as efforts to promote or discredit popular beliefs or make money from videos and photos of a UAP sighting.\n\nWhen & Where Have UAPs Been Reported?\n\nNew Africa / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile UAPs have been reported all over the world, by far most have been reported in the United States since the 1950s. They\u2019ve often been reported around military bases, nuclear missile sites, and naval assets. All of this is what might be expected if some of the sightings reported were tests of advanced aircraft.\n\nThe Extraterrestrial Hypothesis\n\nPeopleImages.com - Yuri A / Shutterstock.com\n\nPopular media has so driven home the idea that UAPs are visitors from other worlds and that the government is covering up contact with them that it is difficult for true believers to consider other more likely explanations. At the same time it is true that in some cases, the prosaic explanations can be ruled out and there are credible professional witnesses, such as US military personnel, backed up by instrumentation that has recorded the objects.\n\nThe idea that these are spaceships flown by \u201clittle green men\u201d makes UAP reports the butt of jokes, but also real questions about how and why alien civilizations would travel so far (and apparently crash so often!) Proponents of the extraterrestrial hypothesis have suggested these beings might not come from another place, but this place in another dimension or time. The idea is that there could be civilizations at higher spacial dimensions that are parallel with our space but invisible to us. Or these could be highly evolved human beings from the very remote future (say, 100,000 years CE) who have learned to time-travel and are studying their past (us).\n\nDoes the Government Have Crashed UAPs?\n\nImageBank4u / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn July 2023, a former U.S. military intelligence officer named David Grusch testified before Congress that the United States has in its possession multiple crashed spacecraft and the remains of \u201cnon-human biologics.\u201d He alleged that the government has been working for decades to reverse-engineer technology recovered from these craft and urged Congressional investigation into these allegations and greater transparency in the government.\n\nIs it a Government Psyops Effort?\n\nBerit Kessler / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust because a former government employee alleges something doesn\u2019t make it true, however. It is possible the United States benefits from the extraterrestrial hypothesis as a form of psychological warfare against its enemies. As Grusch testified, the US was still reeling from Covid-19 and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was ongoing. There was considerable speculation about the possibility of Putin using tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Releasing this type of information at that time might have served a dual purpose of distracting the American people from the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic and making our enemies uncertain about what kind of secret futuristic tech we might break out against them if they go too far.\n\nExtraordinary UAP Abilities\n\nRaggedstone / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf all the different types of features reported in UAP sightings, these are some of the most common. If any of the sightings that showed these capabilities are tests of new military technology, it would indicate breakthroughs that are far more advanced than anyone could have imagined.\n\nHovering or flying without wings or rotors.\n\nUnusual shapes like spheres, triangles, or disks.\n\nHypersonic speeds without causing sonic booms or vapor trails.\n\nExtreme maneuverability: able to stop or sharply change direction instantaneously.\n\nNo visible or audible means of propulsion.\n\nDifficult to observe, photograph, or track clearly and consistently.\n\nAble to move between space, the atmosphere, and water without a perceptible change in performance.\n\nNext up, some examples of military aviation technology that might easily have been mistaken for UAPs.\n\n1. The V-173/XF5U-1 \u201cFlying Pancake\u201d (1942)\n\nHoward Levy via Williams T. Larkins / Wikimedia Commons\n\nThese light, maneuverable fighters didn\u2019t require long runways, so they were ideal for aircraft carriers. They had an unusual disc-shaped wing structure. A prototype was tested in 1942 and an improved version in 1945, but it was cancelled in 1947 in favor of jet-powered aircraft.\n\n2. Project Mogul (1947-1949)\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nThis was a surveillance program that started in 1947 using high altitude balloons to monitor acoustic waves from Soviet nuclear tests. According to the U.S. government, a crash of one of the Mogul systems was the source of the Roswell crash debris.\n\n3. U-2 Dragon Lady (1954)\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\n4. The VZ-9AV Avrocar (1958)\n\nThe U-2 was a high-altitude spy plane that flew at 70,000 feet, out of the range of anti-aircraft guns in the 1950s. Its unconventional design, altitude, and speed may have contributed to some UFO reports of that era.\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nThe Avrocar was a flying disk funded by the U.S. Army and Air Force and developed in Canada in the 1950s and 60s. It was intended as a multipurpose military craft with vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. It was powered by three turbojet engines that allowed it to hover over difficult terrain. It was cancelled in the 1960s due to performance issues like instability, severe vibration, and an inability to hover for more than just a short time. Anyone catching a glimpse of this literal flying saucer could be forgiven for reporting they had seen a literal flying saucer!\n\n5.

F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter (1975)\n\nUnofficially called the \u201cBlackbird,\u201d this long-ranged advanced reconnaissance aircraft flew from 1966-1998. Its unusual shape and capabilities and the high-altitude vapor trails it left were unknown to people in the early years it was being tested.\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nThe US Air Force F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter has an innovative shape and stealth radar-evading capabilities that made it not just impressive, but frightening to anyone who might have caught an unexpected glimpse of one as it was being tested in the 1980s.\n\n7. B-2 Spirit Bomber (1980)\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nThe B-2 Spirit stealth bomber has a futuristic \u201cflying wing\u201d design and a dark color that conceals its shape against the night sky. Seen during the day, it looks startlingly alien, as if it should not even be able to fly. It\u2019s easy to see how it would inspire some UAP reports by citizens.\n\n8. UAVs (drones) (1980s-present)\n\n5. RQ-170 Sentinel\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nUAVs, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, are more commonly known as drones. Developed and tested starting in the 1980s, drones were designed for surveillance and reconnaissance, stealth, and remote strike capabilities. Drones are becoming quite common and are currently being used extensively in the Russia-Ukraine war. They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and new experimental ones are being devised all the time. This makes them a frequent object of UAP reports.\n\n9. B-21 Raider (2015)\n\npublic domain / wikimedia commons\n\nThe B-21 Raider is a new aircraft still in the development phase. It is a 6th-generation long-range strike bomber designed to evade radar and penetrate enemy anti-aircraft defenses to deliver conventional or nuclear payloads. Seen edge-on, its design resembles a combination of a saucer and a flying wing. It will be a replacement for the Air Force\u2019s current fleet of B-2 Spirit bombers. This video provides more details and demonstrates the plane in flight.\n\nFascinating Either Way\n\nGorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nOf course, if UAPs are travelers from another planet, dimension, or time, that\u2019s both extraordinarily exciting and disturbing. But they are interesting no matter what their explanation. Mass hysteria, strange weather, or unknown physical principles? Nice! Let\u2019s figure that out. But if they turn out to be advanced aviation tests, they suggest the world may be on the verge of seeing technology that up until now we\u2019ve seen only in science fiction!\n\nWant to Retire Early?

        "article_content": "WARNING TAKEN WITHOUT PERMISSION Matthew Szydagis, an Associate Professor of physics at the University at Albany\n\nA respected American scholar has processed the data to estimate the timeline for a potential \"catastrophic\" revelation of alien contact. Numerous experts in the UFO domain suspect the Pentagon of concealing proof of various UFO mishaps both within the US and globally. They argue that failing to execute a strategic program for disclosing such details to civilians will result in \"catastrophic\" exposure where incontrovertible evidence hits the public domain sans any precursor. This might spell serious repercussions, postulates distinguished UFO analyst Dr Steven Greer, positing that it could destabilise society and possibly spark riots or wars as humankind grapples with its abrupt shift in perspective. Matthew Szydagis, an Associate Professor in physics from University at Albany, authored an academic paper assessing the statistical odds of this apocalyptic disclosure occurring. While guesting on the UAP Studies podcast, he specified: \"I decided instead of letting things continue to be vague and qualitative to actually do the math.\"\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 29: A group of protestors march in front of the General Accounting Office (GAO) 29 March to raise awarness about an examination being conducted by the GAO for documents about a weather balloon crash at Roswell, N.M. in 1947. The protestors believe the balloon was a crashed UFO. AFP PHOTO (Photo credit should read JOSHUA ROBERTS/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHis analysis emanated from the assumption that there's interaction with extraterrestrial intelligence on Earth, and that a number of reported UFO downfalls are credible. Matthew elaborated: \"I took the assumption that there is some sort of intelligence, they fly ships that can break down and that crashes like Roswell are not fictional but real. Then I went to calculate then how long is it before an accident that can't be cleaned up fast enough happens where the military-industrial complex no longer has control of the narrative.\", reports the Mirror. With the proliferation of smartphones equipped with high-quality cameras in the hands of many, Professor Szydagis mentions that any crash occurring near a major city would be broadcast worldwide at lightning speed, thwarting any attempts at a cover-up. Professor Szydagis, in his academic paper, suggests that we might soon witness concrete proof of alien presence, predicting this evidence could emerge anytime from today until 2060. In the text, he notes: \"The results of simulations of numerous different potential scenarios, of varying degrees of pessimism/optimism, indicate that, if NHI/ETs is/are real, catastrophic disclosure may actually happen accidentally rather soon, with the mean expected year being 2040+/-20 under the default assumptions.\"\n\nFort Worth Army Air Field 8th July 1947: Jesse Marcel, head intelligence officer, who initially investigated and recovered some of the debris from the Roswell UFO site poses with debris. In mid-1947, a United States Air Force balloon crashed at a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. Following wide initial interest in the crashed 'flying disc', the US military stated that it was merely a conventional weather balloon.

He goes on to say: \"People think that religion and politics and governments will fall apart. I'm not so sure I think most people wouldn't care I think that we're in such an era that actually people would just assume it's still fake and just not care.\" \"I'm not sure I buy into the idea that that capturing a crashed alien ship on your smartphone and uploading that, and having enough evidence from multiple people from different angles where it's really hard to claim that it's hoax..\" \"I think that even that is not going to really be catastrophic.\""

One individual claimed to have witnessed strange lights over 100 times since mid-2020, many of which seemed to head toward the base.\n\nThese lights-described as red, green, or white-often moved erratically, hovered for extended periods, or displayed flashing patterns inconsistent with typical aircraft.\n\nIn one of the most unique reports, a witness detailed seeing an amber-orange, cube-shaped object that appeared \"playful\" and seemed to interact with the observer.\n\n\"They always seem to head towards Nellis [AFB],\" the witness noted, adding, \"I don't believe they are man-made.\"\n\nThe sightings near Nellis are not isolated. At Virginia's Joint Base Langley-Eustis, swarms of unidentified drones invaded restricted airspace nightly for nearly three weeks in December 2023.\n\nGeneral Glen VanHerck of NORAD described the phenomenon as unprecedented and urged the Pentagon to deploy advanced tools to investigate.\n\n\"We weren't prepared for the sheer volume of incursions,\" added General Gregory Guillot, VanHerck's successor, highlighting the rising frequency of such incidents across U.S. bases.\n\nAre These Drones or Something Beyond?\n\nWhile many attribute these sightings to advanced military technology or drones, the unexplained behavior of these objects has raised eyebrows.\n\nAlejandro Rojas, a UFO expert with Enigma Labs, explained, \"Given the proximity to experimental aircraft hubs like Area 51, these sightings are often linked to classified projects. But the erratic movements and prolonged hovering suggest something more.\"\n\nHowever, the U.S. military faces challenges in addressing these incidents. Legal and safety restrictions limit the use of anti-drone technology, such as lasers or signal jamming, over domestic airspace.\n\nAccording to Jason Mayes of NORTHCOM, balancing defensive measures with civilian safety remains a significant hurdle. As sightings increase, so does the urgency for transparency and scientific analysis.\n\n\"The Pentagon is scratching its head over these,\" Rojas said. \"Civilian reports and videos are essential for piecing together what's happening. Whether these objects are terrestrial or something entirely new, they deserve a closer look.\"\n\nWhile skepticism persists, the growing frequency of sightings near military sites ensures this mystery will remain a focal point for researchers and the public alike. The question lingers: Are we witnessing cutting-edge technology-or something far more enigmatic?"

        "article_content": "Gemini is Google\u2019s most important product right now, with Google baking its genAI chatbot into as many products as it can. The Pixel 9 served as the key piece of hardware to showcase several new Gemini capabilities, including Gemini Live functionality. That\u2019s the equivalent of OpenAI\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode for ChatGPT, which makes the AI sound like a real human.\n\nBut Google isn\u2019t happy rolling out Gemini to as many Android devices as possible. It\u2019s also targeting the iPhone, a potentially lucrative market for Google when it comes to its AI ambitions.\n\nRumors already say that Apple will soon offer chatbot choices to iPhone users by integrating Google Gemini into Apple Intelligence alongside ChatGPT. The latter will get a period of exclusivity since it\u2019s Apple\u2019s preferred partner for the launch of Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhether or not Gemini comes to Apple Intelligence, Google is testing another way to make Gemini available to iPhone users. The company rolled out a standalone Google Gemini app in some test markets, complete with Gemini Live functionality.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nAn iPhone user posted screenshots on Reddit that prove the Google Gemini app for iPhone is legitimate. According to 9to5Google, the app is available in the Philippines, but you can\u2019t download it from the App Store in the US. I could not find a version of the app in the EU, but then again, the European block is never among the first regions to receive any new AI app.\n\nApp Store listing for the Google Gemini app. Image source: Reddit\n\nThe advantage of having a standalone Gemini app for iPhone is that you can talk to the chatbot directly without going through the iPhone\u2019s Google app. That\u2019s currenty the only way to access Google Gemini on iPhone without loading the chatbot in a browser. Gemini Live is not available in the Google app.\n\nHaving Gemini Live baked into a standalone Gemini app is even better. I got access to Advanced Voice Mode recently inside the ChatGPT app for iPhone, and it was an interesting experience. The smartphone is probably the place to talk to AI via voice rather than text prompts.\n\nGoogle Gemini app installed on an iPhone. Image source: Reddit\n\nGoogle will take advantage of the iPhone\u2019s Live Activity feature to let you talk to Gemini Live even when the screen is off or when you\u2019re using the iPhone for something else. ChatGPT\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode works similarly on the iPhone.\n\nAlso, if Gemini comes to Apple Intelligence, it won\u2019t be available on most current iPhones. Only the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 series support Apple Intelligence. A standalone Google Gemini app would help fix that potential problem.\n\nGemini Live functionality in the Google Gemini app for iPhone. Image source: Reddit\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when Google will launch the Gemini app on iPhone, but it\u2019s probably only a matter of time until it happens. Apparently, Google started testing the standalone app only about a week ago."

        "article_content": "In a nutshell: Google is reportedly testing a standalone Gemini app for iPhones. While the company already offers a Gemini app on Android, iPhone users can only access the AI feature within the main Google app. The standalone app is expected to include additional features not available in the integrated Google app.\n\nAccording to 9to5Google, at least one Reddit user claims to have downloaded the Gemini app from the App Store. Once installed, the app places an icon on the home screen, allowing users to summon the AI assistant with a tap. It also offers a customizable shortcut for quick access. The App Store listing promotes the app as a way to \"Unlock the power of Google AI on your iPhone.\"\n\nCurrently, the Gemini app for iOS is unavailable in most regions, including the US. Users in Canada, Australia, and India have also reported being unable to access the app, indicating that Google may be testing it in select areas before a wider release.\n\nSo far, only one user in the Philippines has reportedly managed to download the app, with screenshots suggesting it has been available in that country's App Store for about a week.\n\nThe new app introduces a feature called Gemini Live, which isn't available in the main Google app. According to the Reddit user, Gemini Live operates in the background with iOS's Live Activity while users multitask, providing a more seamless and convenient experience than the current setup.\n\nAt present, iOS users can only access Gemini by switching to the Gemini tab at the top of the Google search app, a process similar to that on the Gemini website. This method is less seamless and engaging compared to the experience Google offers on its Pixel devices.\n\nGoogle has yet to officially confirm development of a standalone Gemini app for iOS, so a global release date is uncertain. However, with testing seemingly underway, broader availability may come in the next few months.\n\nGemini is Google's AI chatbot powered by its namesake language model, introduced in late 2023 after unifying Bard and Duet AI to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The Gemini app launched on Android earlier this year, enabling users to process documents, summarize emails, and more."

        "article_content": "Biongevity introduces its one-of-a-kind initiatives to promote longevity and healthspan of users across the UAE\n\nDubai, UAE: Biongevity, a leader in innovative health solutions, has unveiled an advanced AI-powered health and wellness app, a platform designed to empower users with personalised fitness and health management tools and the world\u2019s first Longevity Fitness Challenge that will encourage the UAE\u2019s population in making health and fitness a daily priority.\n\nBiongevity is a leading healthcare facility in Dubai that focuses on longevity genetics and precision medicine, offering solutions which help consumer live long through a preventive life-cycle management that extends the life span of individuals with less medical intervention. The launch of its initiatives is underpinned by the tech-driven atmosphere, advanced infrastructure, and health-conscious population of the UAE. Dubai\u2019s repute as a global hub for innovation and wellness technology has further inspired Biongevity to introduce its novel app.\n\nThe pioneering health clinic supports the UAE\u2019s Vision 2031, which emphasises building accessible healthcare systems that elevate quality of life, and beyond by encouraging preventive healthcare and proactive health management. The rapid increase of lifestyle-related diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, in the region signals urgent need to fortify health and curb such illnesses. According to The Lancet, an international medical journal, regular health monitoring can prevent up to 80 percent of cases of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Biongevity caters to this need by offering a technologically driven solution that curates personalised health charts for users.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered Biongevity App will help generate real-time health data and help people to check on their vital health information while on the move and recommend preventive measures on health, despite their busy schedule. It includes face scanning technology that can measure blood pressure and heart rate, offering accurate, on-the-spot results to the user. Other features include tailored diet tips and a health dashboard to track progress. It can further track daily health status without wearable devices. The software also compiles genetic information and guides users with healthier lifestyle choices. Going forward, users can access the app\u2019s myriad features that monitor holistic health and well-being. In addition to physical fitness, the app aims to enhance longevity and support wellness through mental, physical, and genetic insights.\n\nInspired by the Dubai Fitness Challenge, Biongevity is set to launch the world\u2019s first Longevity Fitness Challenge, a 30-day event running from December 1st to December 31st \u2013 to create nation-wide awareness on how to extend life span. Fitness enthusiasts from all over the UAE are welcome to take part in this unique fitness challenge that primarily promotes longevity and healthspan, referring to the quality of life during aging.\n\nParticipants of the Longevity Fitness Challenge can track their progress on the Biongevity app, which features a leaderboard. Each day, a winner will be selected based on engagement and challenge metrics to receive a complimentary longevity assessment. At the end of the challenge, the top 25 participants who log the most steps are crowned \u201cLongevity Champions\u201d, who receive complimentary advanced genetic testing and consultation, providing valuable insights into their health.\n\nThe event takes place at a time when people are increasingly becoming health conscious and are paying greater attention to health and well-being. It will drive users to integrate fitness and health goals into their daily routines as well as reinforce daily wellness habits and educate users on the importance of long-term health maintenance. This will also fuel the formation of healthier societies that support one another in achieving their personal fitness goals.\n\nDue to increased digitisation, the healthcare industry is also shifting from manual to more digital, thanks to technology and innovation.\n\nAccording to a report by Global Market Insights, the UAE\u2019s digital health market is projected to reach Dh2.5 billion by 2025, supported by government initiatives and the rapid adoption of smart technology in the wellness sector. Additionally, over 40 percent of UAE residents currently use health and wellness apps regularly, and fitness-related apps are expanding at a rate of more than 30 percent year-on-year.\n\nAs part of UAE\u2019s thriving community-focused wellness environment, Biongevity\u2019s app will contribute to a movement that has seen the country ranked among the most digitally advanced countries in health management.\n\nThe Longevity Fitness Challenge promotes daily physical activity, aligning perfectly with Biongevity\u2019s mission to support individual health journeys through digital tools. Biongevity\u2019s app provides a one-stop solution for users to track physical activities, set personal health goals, and access expert guidance, creating an ideal support system for anyone looking to enhance their lifestyle. The UAE\u2019s dedication to health and fitness, supported by government initiatives, has also led to a rise in the adoption of fitness and health applications. A study by PwC indicates that 90 percent of UAE residents are willing to use digital health platforms, making it one of the fastest-growing markets for such technology in the Middle East.\n\nCommenting on the launch, Dr. Anmol Kapoor, visionary Founder of BioAro Group of companies, expressed his enthusiasm for the company\u2019s role in the nation\u2019s health movement. \u201cBiongevity\u2019s mission is to transform health management by making advanced technology accessible to everyone in the UAE,\u201d he stated. \u201cDubai is a city that champions both innovation and wellness, making it the perfect environment for our app launch and Longevity Fitness Challenge. Everyone across the country is welcome to be a part of this significant movement. We are excited to see how our solutions can contribute to a healthier, more dynamic community here.\u201d\n\nThe UAE\u2019s active community can download the free-to-access app and explore cutting-edge tools that enhance their fitness journey. Moreover, they can track their progress at the Longevity Fitness Challenge. Participants and residents will be able to experience features like daily activity tracking, goal setting, and AI-driven insights, all tailored to support their personal wellness journeys.\n\nWith over 40 percent of UAE residents using health and wellness applications, the demand for personalised fitness tracking is on the rise. According to data from the UAE\u2019s Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, the UAE has one of the highest smartphone penetration rates globally, at around 97 percent in 2023, creating a favourable landscape for digital health innovations like Biongevity\u2019s app. Biongevity\u2019s app combines advanced AI technology with user-friendly features, creating an all-in-one platform for personal health management. Biongevity\u2019s new app launch demonstrates the company\u2019s dedication to transforming health management through technology.\n\nWith its trendsetting app, Biongevity highlights the importance of early health awareness. Its proactive approach to healthcare will allow users to track and manage their health independently. The integration of AI will not only amplify the range of accessible health monitoring services but also curate personalised routines defined by lifestyles. Biongevity\u2019s contribution towards enhancing the healthspan of its users positions itself as a leader in merging AI with daily health monitoring, ushering in a new era of technology in healthcare.\n\nIn the long run, the healthcare provider aims to expand its footprint beyond the UAE, offering its unique services to users globally. It will further upgrade its app into a platform for health monitoring and longevity-focused wellness worldwide.\n\nAbout Biongevity Clinic\n\nBiongevity Clinic is a leading healthcare facility in Dubai, dedicated to advancing precision health and longevity medicine.

While we hadn\u2019t expected Google to bring its AI assistant app to Apple devices, users in the Philippines are reporting that it is now available, and it seems that this is the testing grounds for a future global release.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, the Google Gemini app is a standalone version of the AI-powered Gemini feature that we\u2019ve seen Google integrate into the browser, but with the addition of Gemini Live, enabling you to interact with the app with your voices. It\u2019s a piece of software that we\u2019ve seen Google introduce to some of the devices from our list of the best Android phones, such as the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, replacing Google Assistant.\n\nThe main reason we weren\u2019t expecting Google Gemini on iPhone is that Apple already has plans to update its own assistant, Siri, with AI capabilities under the Apple Intelligence umbrella. As we found out during the iPhone 16 launch, Apple is working together with Open AI to enhance Siri with the power of ChatGPT. However, we\u2019re not expecting AI-powered improvements to Siri until next year\u2019s iOS 18.2 update, so by the time it arrives, iPhone users could already be used to relying on Gemini.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s still plenty we don\u2019t know about the rollout of Google Gemini on iPhone at the time of writing. The most important factor is what phones it\u2019s compatible with, as Apple Intelligence only runs on the new iPhone 16 series and last year\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max devices. We\u2019re not sure whether Google Gemini requires the same sort of performance horsepower as Apple Intelligence, and unfortunately, the original Reddit poster who shared the details on the app hasn\u2019t detailed what phone they\u2019re using. However, we\u2019ve seen Google introduce Gemini features to older Androids, so we\u2019re hoping this might provide some AI goodness for those still using older iPhones.\n\nOf course, we\u2019ll keep an eye out for any updates on when and if we can expect the global rollout of Google Gemini on iPhone, provided the testing phase all goes to plan. While you\u2019re here, have a look at the latest and greatest Apple hardware with our guides to the best gaming iPhones and the best iPads."

        "article_content": "Charles Fort pioneered the paranormal and invented alien abductions The Book Of The Damned author was no crank or fraud, but someone who questioned everything.\n\nWe explore some of Wikipedia\u2019s oddities in our 6,922,857-part monthly series, Wiki Wormhole.\n\nThis month\u2019s entry: Charles Fort\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: From Mulder and Scully to Mabel and Dipper, inquisitive minds have long sought to peer beyond the veil of mystery and find the world\u2019s hidden truths. The early 20th century\u2019s foremost believer that the truth was out there was Charles Fort, a writer who wrote about what Wikipedia calls \u201cscientific anomalies,\u201d starting with his first book in 1919, the scientifically titled The Book Of The Damned. 1970s occult magazine The Fortean Times cemented Fort as the first name in strange phenomena.\n\nBiggest controversy: It\u2019s hard to tell how earnest Fort actually was. He once said \u201cI believe nothing of my own that I have ever written,\u201d and UFO writer Jerome Clark called him \u201cessentially a satirist.\u201d At the same time, his curiosity was genuine, and some of his writing had real merit. While he was interested in poltergeists, teleportation (he\u2019s believed to have coined the term), and may have been the first person ever to write about alien abduction, Fort was also fascinated by legitimate scientific phenomena that science had no explanation for\u2014ball lightning, phantom cats (big cats found well outside their natural geographic range), and unexplained disappearances.\n\nThe simplest explanation seems to be not that Fort was a crank or a fraud, but that he questioned everything unexplained, real or not.\n\nStrangest fact: Fort\u2019s friends started a Fortean society and had to trick him into joining. A group of writers including Ben Hecht, Theodore Dreiser, Alexander Woollcott, and Fort\u2019s editor Tiffany Thayer, organized a Fortean Society in 1931, full of writers who admired his ideas. But Fort himself was \u201clured to its inaugural meeting by false telegrams.\u201d Fort objected to the group, surmising that it would quickly fill up with true believers in the occult, and not questioners and skeptics as he was. He refused the presidency of his own fan club, and Dreiser had to step in in his place.\n\nThe Society petered out when Thayer died in 1959, but much of their materials passed to the International Fortean Organization (INFO), which started in the early \u201960s and still exists. The Fortean Times magazine began publishing monthly in 1973, and is still in circulation in the U.K.\n\nThing we were happiest to learn: While Fort is hardly a household name, he casts a long shadow. Sci-fi writers, including Philip K. Dick, Robert Heinlein, and Robert Anton Wilson, have all noted him as an influence. Alfred Bester\u2019s novel The Stars My Destination names the first teleporter after Ford. And Stephen King mentions Fort in several books (the parents of the child at the center of Firestarter are advised to read Fort instead of Dr. Spock). Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s 1999 film Magnolia is full of unexplained events drawn from Fort, (among other things, Fort was fascinated by animals falling from the sky without explanation), and a scene set in a library has one of Fort\u2019s books on display.\n\nThing we were unhappiest to learn: It was likely trauma that pushed Fort into Forteana. His father, a Dutch-born grocer, was authoritarian and abusive, so young Charles escaped as best he could, into books and nature. While he wasn\u2019t a good student, he was a voracious reader, and collected shells, minerals, and birds, with an eye towards being a naturalist. He escaped in a larger sense as soon as he turned 18, traveling around the western U.S., the U.K., and southern Africa, where he fell ill. (He was nursed back to health by a childhood friend, Anna Filing, who he soon married). But then another cruel fate befell Fort\u2014he became a freelance writer. He likely would have struggled on working odd jobs and publishing the odd piece in newspapers and magazines, except a wealthy uncle left him an inheritance large enough to let him quit his job and focus on writing about the truly odd.\n\nBest link to elsewhere on Wikipedia: One of the oldest strange phenomena Fort wrote about was spontaneous human combustion. Scientific debate still rages on whether the phenomena is real, but no one can deny that in rare instances, human remains have been found destroyed by an explosion with no apparent cause. Reports go back as far as 1731, when Italian Countess Cornelia Zangari Bandi was found dead one morning\u2014rather, her lower legs, three fingers, and part of her skull were found amidst a heap of ash in her bedroom. The case was famous enough that Dickens mentions the Countess in Bleak House, and the \u201cpossibility of what is called spontaneous combustion.\u201d\n\nScience\u2019s best guess at an explanation is that these incidents are not spontaneous, but caused by an external source like a cigarette, which ignites alcohol on the victim\u2019s clothes, and their body fat adds fuel to the fire. (Heavy drinking and low mobility that would prevent an escape do seem to be common factors in many spontaneous combustion cases).\n\nFurther down the Wormhole: Usually we take a few twists and turns to get to our next topic, but it\u2019s hard to resist going straight for List of Reportedly Haunted Locations. (Oddly enough, one of the Haunted Locations is named Charles Fort, but it\u2019s a fort in Ireland built for English King Charles II during Britain\u2019s long occupation of Ireland.) We\u2019ll find out whether we are or ain\u2019t \u2018fraid of no ghost next month."

        "article_content": "A team of biologists led by The University of Texas at Arlington has discovered a new tiny lizard species in the Paria Peninsula of northeastern Venezuela. This discovery, published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, highlights the unique characteristics of this gecko, including its small size (about 2.5 inches long), brown color, cone-shaped head, long snout and particular skull anatomy.\n\nThe new species, Pseudogonatodes fuscofortunatus, was identified through a combination of visual examination, molecular genetics and high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. Part of what makes this gecko unique is its distinct skeletal features, including fully separated nasal bones and fused parietal bones\u2014uncommon traits among similar geckos. These characteristics, along with genetic data, distinguish it from other species within the genus Pseudogonatodes.\n\nThe discovery was made during fieldwork in the evergreen forests of the slopes of mountains in the Paria Peninsula, an area in northeastern Venezuela that juts into the Caribbean Sea and is known for its high biodiversity, moderate temperatures and lush vegetation. The researchers collected specimens in 2002 and again in 2014, noting the gecko\u2019s unique skull structure, which led to further investigation. The species name, fuscofortunatus, reflects the brown coloration of the gecko and the fortunate circumstances of its discovery.\n\n\u201cThe Paria Peninsula, part of the Coastal Mountain Range of Venezuela, has been a hotspot for reptile and amphibian discoveries in recent decades,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Walter E. Schargel, a professor of instruction in biology and earth and environmental sciences at UT Arlington. \u201cThe region\u2019s complex geography and climate create diverse habitats that can support a wide range of species. The new gecko species adds to the growing list of reptiles that live only in this area, emphasizing the need for continued exploration and conservation efforts in the region.\u201d\n\nThe research team included experts from various institutions in the United States, Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. Their collaborative efforts and combined field observations, museum specimen comparisons, DNA sequencing and advanced imaging techniques led to a comprehensive description of the new species.\n\n\u201cThis discovery not only enriches our understanding of the biodiversity in this part of Venezuela, but it underscores the significance of preserving these unique ecosystems,\u201d said Dr. Schargel. \u201cI hope this discovery fuels increased conservation measures to protect the habitats of this rare species and other native species in the region.\u201d\n\nThe study highlights the potential for further discoveries in the Paria Peninsula and similar areas, where many animal species remain undocumented. The use of modern technologies, such as CT scanning and molecular genetic analysis, play a crucial role in uncovering the hidden diversity of life on Earth, offering new insights into the evolutionary history and ecological adaptations of these fascinating creatures.\n\n***\n\nFunding for the project came from the U.S. National Science Foundation, a Biodiversity Consultancy grant through Oro Verde and Fundacion Proyecto Paria, the EDGE program of the Zoological Society of London, and Fondation Segre.\n\nAbout The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA)\n\nLocated in the heart of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive teaching, research, and public service institution dedicated to the advancement of knowledge through scholarship and creative work. With an enrollment of approximately 41,000 students, UT Arlington is the second-largest institution in the UT System. UTA\u2019s combination of outstanding academics and innovative research contributes to its designation as a Carnegie R-1 \u201cVery High Research Activity\u201d institution, a significant milestone of excellence. The University is designated as a Hispanic Serving-Institution and an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution by the U.S. Department of Education and has earned the Seal of Excelencia for its commitment to accelerating Latino student success.

        "source": "Business Insider",
        "article_content": "San Francisco, Nov. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In the past two years, a wave of AI-powered data tools has flooded the market, each claiming to replace data analysts. The reality consistently falls short of the promise. These tools are unable to interpret the fragmented, chaotic data pipelines inherent in enterprise systems, leaving data teams still spending 87% of their time organizing data and enterprises spending an average of $4.6 million every year on manual data analysis \u2014 until now.\n\nConnecty AI , emerging from stealth today with $1.8 million in pre-seed funding, has developed a context engine that tackles the inherent complexity in enterprise data. The round was led by Market One Capital, with participation from Notion Capital and data industry experts including Marcin Zukowski, co-founder of Snowflake and Maciej Zawadzinski, Founder of Piwik PRO.\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecty AI founders Aish Agarwal and Peter Wisniewski.\n\nToday, enterprise data teams navigate complexity across three critical dimensions: horizontal data pipelines (including multi-source ingestion, multi-cloud data warehousing, data lineage tools, and cataloging systems), diverse consumption patterns (spanning CRM systems, BI dashboards, and machine learning applications), and distributed human knowledge across roles like data engineers, analysts, governance teams, and functional managers.\n\nWhile early AI solutions attempted to automate data workflows by interpreting complex schemas, these models fall short in enterprise environments. Even 90% accuracy isn't enough when dealing with real-world data complexity. Large Language Models need more than static schema files; they require a continuously evolving, cohesive understanding across systems and teams.\n\n\"Our experience has shown us that effective data management is about more than just technology\u2014it's about connecting the dots between data sources, business objectives and the people who use them,\" said Aish Agarwal, CEO of Connecty AI. \"Any ad-hoc 'guerrilla style experimentation' with LLM data agents can lead to a pilot application but it's a lot harder to build a production level application that is reliable.\"\n\nAt its core, Connecty AI does two things: first, it extracts and connects three-dimensional context from diverse data sources and use-cases while integrating real-time human feedback, creating an enterprise-specific context graph. Second, it leverages this context to automate data tasks across various roles, using a personalized dynamic semantic system. The engine operates continuously in the background, proactively generating recommendations within data pipelines, updating documentation, and uncovering hidden metrics aligned with business goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecty AI user interface\n\nDuring prototype development, Connecty AI has partnered with enterprises ranging from $5 million to $2 billion ARR, validating its approach on real-world data rather than public datasets like Spider. The platform connects to data warehouses like Snowflake or BigQuery in less than five minutes with no-code deployment. Early results have been compelling: \"Our data complexity is growing fast, and it takes longer to data prep and analyze metrics. We would wait 2-3 weeks on average to prepare data and extract actionable insights from our product usage data and merge with transactional and marketing data. Now with Connecty AI, it's a matter of minutes!\" said Nicolas Heymann, CEO Kittl.\n\n\"We were impressed with the accuracy of responses from day one. Additionally, Connecty AI generated excellent suggestions to improve the schema descriptions and enhanced our semantic layer. It offers a unified flow from prep to querying, nothing like that we've seen anywhere else,\" added Aditya Upadhyay, Director Analytics, Mindtickle.\n\nFounded by Aish Agarwal and Peter Wisniewski, Connecty AI emerged from their complementary experiences in the data value chain. At FL Studio, Agarwal encountered the inefficiencies caused by fragmented data systems delaying business insights, while Wisniewski's experience building data platforms for Point72 hedge fund and a major European e-commerce player highlighted similar challenges from a data engineering perspective.\n\nThe timing of the duo\u2019s emergence from stealth aligns with growing market demand. Businesses are demanding more from AI. According to Future Markets Insights, the global AI Analytics market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 22.6%, reaching $223 billion by 2034. As data complexity grows, organizations face increasing costs, with data teams consuming 12.5% of IT budgets\u2014an average of $5.4 million annually, with 87% dedicated solely to data and platform maintenance.\n\n\"We are thrilled to back Connecty AI as they redefine enterprise data management with their deep context learning,\" said Jacek \u0141ubi\u0144ski, Partner at Market One Capital. \"The platform's ability to unify and contextualize data across fragmented systems presents a massive opportunity for businesses looking to use LLMs for data workflow automation. The vision Aish and Peter have resonates with us and we're excited to support them on the journey.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Connecty AI will expand its context engine's capabilities across additional data sources and offer it as a service via API. In a market flooded with AI tools that promise to replace human analysts but deliver unreliable results, Connecty AI is taking a fundamentally different approach \u2013 embracing the complexity of enterprise data environments and augmenting rather than replacing human expertise.\n\nEnds\n\nAbout Connecty AI\n\nConnecty AI offers enterprise data agents that help organizations agentize complex data tasks, saving up to 80% of time on manual data prep and analysis while accelerating decision-making. Founded by seasoned executives with decades of experience and backed by leading voices in data, Connecty AI uses a context engine to connect and unify context from platform-agnostic data sources. This engine leverages a context graph to agentize data tasks across various roles through a personalized, dynamic semantic system. Integrating seamlessly with tools like Bigquery, Databricks, Snowflake, and Power BI, Connecty AI redefines enterprise data automation to augment\u2014not replace\u2014human expertise.\n\nAbout Market One Capital\n\nMarket One Capital (MOC) is an early stage VC firm investing into companies of tomorrow with network effects potential. With EUR 140M AuM MOC invests predominantly into platforms, infrastructure software, networks, data infrastructure, and vertical software. The team behind MOC has a track record of investing into more than 80 startups at early stage, including 3 unicorns.\n\nNotion Capital (\u201cNotion\u201d) is Europe\u2019s leading early-stage venture investor in business software.

        "article_content": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is concerned that Tesla\u2019s use of social media and its website makes false promises about the automaker\u2019s full-self driving (FSD) software.\n\nThe warning dates back from May, but was made public in an email to Tesla released on November 8.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe NHTSA opened an investigation in October into 2.4 million Tesla vehicles equipped with the FSD software, following three reported collisions and a fatal crash. The investigation centers on FSD\u2019s ability to perform in \u201crelatively common\u201d reduced visibility conditions, such as sun glare, fog, and airborne dust.\n\nIn these instances, it appears that \u201cthe driver may not be aware that he or she is responsible\u201d to make appropriate operational selections, or \u201cfully understand\u201d the nuances of the system, NHTSA said.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cTesla\u2019s X (Twitter) account has reposted or endorsed postings that exhibit disengaged driver behavior,\u201d Gregory Magno, the NHTSA\u2019s vehicle defects chief investigator, wrote to Tesla in an email.\n\nThe postings, which included reposted YouTube videos, may encourage viewers to see FSD-supervised as a \u201cRobotaxi\u201d instead of a partially automated, driver-assist system that requires \u201cpersistent attention and intermittent intervention by the driver,\u201d Magno said.\n\nIn one of a number of Tesla posts on X, the social media platform owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a driver was seen using FSD to reach a hospital while undergoing a heart attack. In another post, a driver said he had used FSD for a 50-minute ride home. Meanwhile, third-party comments on the posts promoted the advantages of using FSD while under the influence of alcohol or when tired, NHTSA said.\n\nTesla\u2019s official website also promotes conflicting messaging on the capabilities of the FSD software, the regulator said.\n\nNHTSA has requested that Tesla revisit its communications to ensure its messaging remains consistent with FSD\u2019s approved instructions, namely that the software provides only a driver assist/support system requiring drivers to remain vigilant and maintain constant readiness to intervene in driving.\n\nTesla last month unveiled the Cybercab, an autonomous-driving EV with no steering wheel or pedals. The vehicle has been promoted as a robotaxi, a self-driving vehicle operated as part of a ride-paying service, such as the one already offered by Alphabet-owned Waymo.\n\nBut Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology has remained under the scrutiny of regulators. FSD relies on multiple onboard cameras to feed machine-learning models that, in turn, help the car make decisions based on what it sees.\n\nMeanwhile, Waymo\u2019s technology relies on premapped roads, sensors, cameras, radar, and lidar (a laser-light radar), which might be very costly, but has met the approval of safety regulators."

        "article_content": "Representative Image\n\nGenAI, chips and more\n\nSmartphones are becoming increasingly expensive, driven by a combination of factors including the rising cost of advanced components, the transition to 5G technology, and the integration of cutting-edge features like generative AI.According to Counterpoint Research, the global average selling price (ASP) of smartphones is projected to rise by 3% in 2024 and an additional 5% in 2025. This upward trend is largely attributed to the increasing demand for premium devices equipped with powerful processors and advanced AI capabilities.Generative AI, in particular, is a significant driver of smartphone premiumization. As consumers become more interested in AI-powered features, smartphone manufacturers are investing heavily in developing SoCs with enhanced CPU, NPU, and GPU capabilities. This increased complexity and performance come at a higher cost. \u201cAs we enter the AI smartphone era, the integration of GenAI features is expected to continue this upward trend,\u201d the report said.The transition to advanced manufacturing processes, such as 4nm and 3nm, is also contributing to rising component costs. These processes enable smaller, more efficient chips but require significant investments in research and development.In addition to hardware advancements, the increasing complexity of software and AI algorithms is further driving up costs. As smartphones become more sophisticated, manufacturers need to allocate more resources to software development and optimization.While the rising prices may be a concern for consumers, the benefits of these advancements are undeniable. AI-powered smartphones offer a range of innovative features, from improved camera performance to more intelligent virtual assistants. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more powerful and feature-rich smartphones in the future."
