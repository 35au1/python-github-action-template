Discover SCENE\n\nU.S. Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ), who posted to his X (formerly known as Twitter) account Friday a video he took of swarms of mysterious drones that have been spotted nightly during the past few weeks, said he was increasingly concerned about the unexplained phenomenon.\n\nKim, who joined local police in rural Clinton Township, New Jersey, 36 miles north of Trenton, said he spotted small clusters of two to four drones a number of times throughout the evening.\n\n\u201cWe often saw about 5-7 lights at a time that were low and not associated with aircraft we could see on the tracker app,\u201d Kim said, noting that the group used a flight tracker app to distinguish the drones from airplanes. \u201cSome hovered while others moved across the horizon.\u201d\n\nLast night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here\u2019s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDn \u2014 Andy Kim (@AndyKimNJ) December 13, 2024\n\nKim said police have tried to get close to the drones using helicopters, but when approached, the drones would turn off their lights and go dark, echoing a statement by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis has gone on for weeks,\u201d Kim wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren\u2019t able to track these devices to determine origin, and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and countermeasures.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, eyewitnesses are pushing back against government claims that the drones pose no threat to communities or infrastructure. The growing story has spread to New York, Maryland, and Connecticut, where officials are demanding answers, while new reports of \u201ccar-sized\u201d UFOs were registered in California and parts of Europe.\n\n\u201cWhy is no one talking about the incident that caused an evac helicopter to not be able to pick up a patient due to these drones being in the way of where the helicopter had to go, and made the helicopter turn around and not be able to get the patient?\u201d New Jersey resident Roseann Stanley said on X. \u201cYet they are saying these drones have not caused any problems. That is a huge problem.\u201d\n\nOn November 26, a medical helicopter heading to an accident in Branchburg Township in Somerset County was unable to pick up an injured patient due to drones hovering near the landing zone, according to a report by New Jersey media outlet NJ.com.\n\nHundreds of drones were first spotted in mid-November flying over New Jersey; eyewitnesses have reported seeing convoys of drones almost every night since then and have described the crafts, in some cases, as being as big as the hood of a car, and performing in more sophisticated ways than off-the-shelf, consumer-oriented drones.\n\nThough the mysterious objects have been reported in the vicinity of a number of New Jersey-based military installations, with speculation about their provenance ranging from aliens from outer space to Iranian spycraft, Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Wednesday that no government facilities have been threatened by the drones.\n\nWhite House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said during a press conference on Thursday that \u201cwhile there is no known malicious activity occurring, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight a gap in authorities.\u201d\n\nKirby argued for new legislation that will better \u201cidentify and mitigate any potential threats to airports or other critical infrastructure, and so that state and local authorities are provided all the tools that they need to respond to such threats as well.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, many people believe the whole thing is much ado about nothing, and probably a stunt of some kind.\n\n\u201cI think these are just normal drones,\u201d Joseph Steinberg, a local resident, told Decrypt. \u201cMy daughter saw a large one, I went outside with her and we looked, but it was hard to judge the size.\u201d\n\n\"The first problem in situations like this is that beyond the initial drone sightings, you quickly get an overwhelming number of reports of things that aren\u2019t drones,\" Grant Jordan, the CEO of San Diego-based drone detection software company SkySafe, told Decrypt. \"When I look at these videos, the vast majority\u201499 out of 100\u2014aren't drones. They're aircraft, helicopters, satellites.\"\n\nAs Jordan explained, the flood of recent drone reports in New Jersey reveals two issues. First, people rarely observe the night sky, and mistake normal air traffic\u2014flashing lights, moving objects\u2014for something unusual. Second, judging the size and distance in the sky is difficult.\n\nWhile Jordan did not attribute these ongoing sightings to a growing hysteria, he did caution that copycats are likely at work, trying to capitalize on the public\u2019s fear and interest.\n\n\"When a story like this gets attention, it draws more people in\u2014some flying drones to look for others, and some just flying them to mess with people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are now seeing these drones in San Diego and the videos that were shown, it's just standard air traffic going into the San Diego Airport.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nWhistleblowers have claimed there is a secret Pentagon UFO data retrieval program codenamed Immaculate Constellation. The program supposedly is used to \u201cdetect\u201d and \u201cquarantine\u201d the military\u2019s best UFO imagery, videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis program has supposedly been hidden from Congressional oversight since 2017, the whistleblowers claim. Immaculate Constellation is what is known, according to a government source, as an \u201cUnacknowledged Special Access Program,\u201d or USAP.\n\nNaturally, a Pentagon spokesperson denied the existence of the program. Really though, what else could they have said about a government program that the whistleblowers claim is \u201cabove top secret?\u201d\n\nThis week, more fuel was added to the conspiratorial fire when an email containing UFO images allegedly from the U.S. military were leaked online by an anonymous source.\n\nAccording to DailyMail.com\u2026\n\nThe black-and-white images show ornately spiked \u2018cruciform\u2019 UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating \u2018hot\u2019 cube, traditional flying saucers and several other craft that look straight out of classic science fiction. The screengrabs are said to be from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by military \u2018heads up displays,\u2019 but details were redacted to protect both sensitive US national security interests.\n\n\u201cThis person has asked me to redact their email address, although I can tell you that there is nothing identifiable in it,\u201d said Nathan Latvaitis of the YouTube channel Strange Mysteries, which has almost two million subscribers and is where the images were first made public.\n\n\u201cThe UAPs [Unidentified Aerial Phenomena] observed demonstrate capabilities far beyond conventional aerospace benchmarks,\u201d the whistleblower wrote about the photographs that were allegedly taken at sensitive military locations.\n\n\u201cShape-shifting has been observed \u2014 possibly due to advanced cloaking or optical refraction \u2014 referred to as \u2018morphogenic behavior,\u2019 allowing for adaptation to environments or missions,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also addressed those who doubt the images authenticity.\n\n\u201cMany traditional media outlets would require verification of my identity and credentials,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is not feasible due to the risks involved. [Those news media] organizations, despite their best intentions, are not equipped to handle the level of secrecy and potential retaliation associated with this information.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was part of one of the legacy programs,\u201d he continued. \u201cI know that\u2019s vague, but unfortunately that\u2019s all I can offer at this point.\u201d\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger, founder of the website Public, was one of the witnesses to testify before Congress in November. He said in his testimony that the Immaculate Constellation program has thousands of images of UFOs.\n\n\u201cWhat the American people need to know is that the U.S., military and intelligence community are sitting on a huge amount of visual and other information: still photos, video, photos, other sensor information, and they have for a very long time,\u201d Shellenberger said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not those fuzzy photos and videos that we\u2019ve been given. There\u2019s very clear, high resolution [images].\u201d"

While some believe the objects could be Iranian drones sent to spy on Americans, the truth might be far less thrilling.\n\nAccording to a post shared on X, the unidentified objects are most likely just one object, a drone developed by PteroDynamics. The XP-4 is one of the company\u2019s latest technological developments, and it\u2019s being developed for the U.S. Navy as a logistics and recon drone.\n\nThis matches the videos I've seen and certainly helps explain the government's odd response. pic.twitter.com/RiOVhspWEY \u2014 Samuel Hammond \ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udfdb (@hamandcheese) December 13, 2024\n\nPart of the confusion surrounding New Jersey\u2019s mysterious UFO reports, though, is the response from the U.S. government, which has continued to say that they aren\u2019t sure who the flying objects belong to. Based on the news shared on X, though, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at all.\n\nHowever, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that the U.S. government has been secretive about something like this. In fact, the government continues to hold the specifics of the various missions that its secret space plane are conducting close to the chest. And, since the XP-4 is a drone designed for the U.S. military, it makes sense it wouldn\u2019t want to talk about it too openly if it were behind sightings of New Jersey\u2019s mysterious UFOs.\n\nTech.

Some will likely still continue to hold that New Jersey\u2019s mysterious UFOs are drones spying for other countries. What makes the PteroDynamics angle so believable, though, is the fact that the drone is the same size as what has been reported.\n\nAdditionally, the XP-4\u2019s flight path matches with the reported sightings that have been coming in over the past several weeks in New Jersey. All of that tied together with the U.S. governments reluctance to say exactly who the drones belong to could very well point to this being the truth."

            "article_content": "The unexplained sightings of drones across North Jersey's night skies have sparked curiosity and unease.\n\nReports of the hovering crafts buzzing the region have left residents wondering if they are the tools of hobbyists, covert military experiments or something even more mysterious.\n\nThe puzzling spectacle is, of course, not the first for the state, which has hosted steered flying objects in its skies since 1863. For generations, New Jersey has played host to stories of the strange and the surreal, including Martian invasions and ghostly treasure guardians.\n\nWas a UFO seen in NJ in 1966?\n\nOne of the most famous stories came on a 1966 cold, clear winter evening in Wanaque, when residents reported seeing mysterious lights hovering over the Wanaque Reservoir. The event, which would later be recounted as one of New Jersey\u2019s most famous UFO sightings, involved numerous witnesses, including police officers and town officials. All described a strange, glowing object moving in inexplicable ways.\n\nThe first reports came around 6:30 p.m. Patrolman Joseph Cisco, responding to a dispatch about a glowing light, spotted what he described as a pulsating orb, larger than a star, hovering silently in the sky. Other calls quickly followed, with sightings reported in Ringwood, Paterson and Oakland.\n\nWanaque Mayor Harry Wolfe, along with Councilmen Warren Hagstrom and Arthur Barton, happened to be nearby and joined Cisco at the scene. The mayor\u2019s 14-year-old son, Billy Wolfe, identified the object, describing it as a brilliant, steady light changing colors from white to red to green.\n\nThe intensity of the incident escalated as additional witnesses claimed to see the light interact with the frozen reservoir. Civil Defense Director Bentley Spencer reported seeing a beam of light shoot down toward the ice, which some described as \"burning a hole.\" Reservoir worker Fred Steines confirmed the unusual activity at the dam. Other witnesses described the object as disc-shaped or oval.\n\nThe following night, Patrolman Jack Wardlaw reported seeing a similar object near his home in Stonetown moving erratically and disappearing over nearby mountains. By October 1966, more sightings followed, including one from Sgt. Ben Thompson, who described a glowing object moving low over the mountains before accelerating upward.\n\nVarious explanations were offered in the years that followed. A study by Vestigia in 1979 theorized that seismic activity near the Ramapo fault might have caused luminous phenomena, while the Pentagon suggested a rare celestial alignment of Venus and Jupiter. Eyewitnesses, however, rejected these theories and the events remain unexplained.\n\nA UFO hoax perpetrated in NJ in 2009\n\nLike many of New Jersey's more unbelievable stories, another UFO mystery turned out to be a hoax. It started in January 2009 in Morristown, when five red lights appeared in the night sky. Dubbed the \"Morristown UFO,\" these lights sparked widespread speculation about extraterrestrial activity, with some residents and UFO enthusiasts convinced they were witnessing a genuine sighting when they reportedly saw them hover in a triangular formation before moving across the sky.\n\nHowever, on April 1, 2009, two young men, Joe Rudy and Chris Russo \u2014 now a Morristown councilman \u2014 revealed that the event was a carefully orchestrated hoax.\n\nUsing helium balloons and road flares, they had staged the \"UFO\" as a social experiment to highlight the unreliability of eyewitness testimony and the sensationalism surrounding UFO investigations. They released videos documenting their process, which debunked theories of advanced aircraft or alien visitation and underscored how easily UFO stories could gain traction without substantial evidence.\n\nA witch trial in New Jersey?\n\nNew Jersey's strange happenings and hoaxes date back centuries. In 1730, an account emerged in the Pennsylvania Gazette about New Jersey's only alleged witch trial.\n\nDrawing a crowd of 300 villagers, the trial was reportedly held in Mount Holly to determine the fate of two residents accused of casting spells on a neighbor\u2019s livestock. The spells allegedly caused the sheep to dance and the hogs to sing psalms.\n\nThe story ended without a definitive conclusion and its veracity was never confirmed or truly debunked. Many historians, however, have claimed newspaper publisher and Founding Father Benjamin Franklin devised the article as a satire meant to criticize superstition and possibly poke fun at residents of Burlington County.\n\nA prank by New Jersey's P.T. Barnum\n\nFranklin's Mount Holly hoax set the stage for New Jersey\u2019s reputation as a fertile ground for pranks. That ground in 1843 would be trodden by famous prankster P.T. Barnum, who with a bombardment of posters promised residents of New York City a summertime display like none other across the Hudson River.\n\nThe ads claimed Hoboken would host a thrilling \"Grand Buffalo Hunt\" on Aug. 31. Cowboys were to showcase their lasso skills on a herd of American bison brought from the untamed West. Best of all, the event was free. Thousands ultimately made the journey, according to the 1995 book \"P.T. Barnum: America's Greatest Showman.\"\n\nBarnum, in his biography, described partnering with ferry operators to get half of the day's fares. The gamble paid off spectacularly. More than 20,000 people reportedly crossed to Hoboken. By day\u2019s end, Barnum had cleared a profit of $3,500, a windfall for the era.\n\nInstead of powerful beasts, attendees were greeted by a motley collection of frail buffalo that Barnum purchased for $700. Making matters worse was weak fencing that allowed frightened bison to break through the arena holding the event and flee into the nearby swamps.\n\nHidden Revolutionary War treasure ghost in NJ? No!\n\nA legend of British Loyalists burying treasure as they fled George Washington\u2019s forces during the Revolutionary War led another hoax perpetrator to bring fright to the Morristown area. Ransford Rodgers, a former Connecticut schoolteacher, arrived in the area in the late 1780s claiming he could unlock the mystery of the fabled treasure many believed was hidden on Schooley Mountain.\n\nRodgers wove an enticing narrative, insisting that the treasure's location was protected by a ghost, as detailed in Peter Zablocki's recent book \"The 1788 Morristown Ghost Hoax. This spirit, Rodgers claimed, could only be exorcised with his specialized skills.\n\nProminent families in Morristown, entranced by the promise of both riches and adventure, were extorted for large sums of money. Rodgers' elaborate ruse, complete with staged supernatural encounters and spiritual ceremonies, duped the town\u2019s elite before it all unraveled and Rodgers fled the area.\n\nMundane and dumb hoaxes that happened in New Jersey\n\nHeadline-making hoaxes in the 20th century generally included fake kidnappings, deaths and, in the century's second half, bomb scares.\n\nThere were the mundane hoaxes, including one involving taxicab owner William A. Carlock from Pearl River, New York, who claimed to be held up by three armed and masked bandits in Park Ridge in November 1939. In reality, it was Carlock's attempt to steal revenue intended for a coach company so he could pay off his debt.\n\nThere were also the dumb ones, including the one involving the fake merchant seaman hero from Dumont. At 16, William E. Jerlat left home to work odd jobs between Albany and New Orleans before returning home in April 1942 with claims he had joined the U.S. Maritime Service and twice cheated death, The Record reported in September 1943.\n\nThe first time, Jerlat said the merchant freighter he was on was attacked and he went overboard with his hair on fire to save a shipmate. The second time, he said U-boats attacked his ship and he somehow woke up in Africa. The claims were later debunked and investigated by U.S. Naval Intelligence.\n\nAnother hoax took place in April 1981 at the Veterans Administration hospital in East Orange, where an alleged gunman dressed as a doctor purportedly threatened to kill state Sen. James Wallwork. The hospital\u2019s chief of police, Joseph Lancellotti, claimed to have wrestled the would-be assailant to the ground, but said the individual managed to escape. However, an FBI investigation soon revealed that the entire incident was a hoax orchestrated by Lancellotti.\n\nNew Jersey's most famous hoax\n\nMost prominently, New Jersey played host to one of the most famous hoaxes of all time.\n\nOn Halloween Eve in 1938, the Garden State became the epicenter of mass hysteria, thanks to Orson Welles' infamous radio broadcast of \"The War of the Worlds.\" For listeners across America, the mock news reports describing a Martian invasion felt chillingly real. But for residents of Grovers Mill, a small community in West Windsor, the drama hit far too close to home.\n\nThe broadcast, performed by Welles and the Mercury Theatre on the Air, reimagined H.G. Wells\u2019 1898 novel as a live event. Interspersed between music segments, faux news bulletins described explosions on Mars followed by a Martian landing in Grovers Mill. With its realistic tone, the broadcast sparked chaos. Traffic jams clogged the streets, phones rang off the hook and panic swept across the nation.\n\nOne Grovers Mill resident, William Dock, reportedly fired shots at a water tower in the moonlight, mistaking it for a Martian war machine. Families packed their belongings and fled in search of safety, while others drove into the hamlet, hoping to catch a glimpse of the alien invaders.\n\nBob Sanders, then 6 years old, recalled the surreal scene in a 2013 interview with USA Today. \"Fathers put their families in a car and took off for parts unknown,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cOther people came to see what they [the Martians] looked like.\u201d\n\nFor some, the simulated invasion seemed far too real. In Newark, dozens of families fled their homes, believing a gas attack was underway. The New York Times reported widespread disruption, with households and religious services interrupted, roads gridlocked and communication lines overwhelmed.\n\nWelles' inspiration reportedly came from the Hindenburg disaster of 1937. His team mimicked the measured tones of news announcers and fueled the staged panic's believability."

Nobody has combined AI and wellness better than the folks behind the new Pensive app, and you can experience their evidence-based, always-accessible coaching for 50% off from now through Jan. 1.\n\nSee at Pensive\n\nStart with the free 7-day trial to see how you can benefit from Pensive\u2019s 5-minute daily conversations. If you\u2019re like the other early users of this revolutionary new app, who have given Pensive a stellar average rating of 4.9 stars, you\u2019ll discover this is an innovative and effective way to help make your mental health resolutions stick in 2025.\n\nAI Therapy Is Having a Moment\n\nInterest in AI mental wellness support has been exploding \u2014 up by 400% as people seek new, inexpensive methods of maintaining their mental health that are also accessible 24/7.

But Pensive delves deep into the enormous potential of AI, grounded in evidence-based techniques and drawing on everything from classical schools of thought like Buddhism and Stoicism to modern psychology and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n\nAlways There for You\n\nPensive\u2019s mental wellness benefits come from daily conversations that are as short as 5 minutes long, and can be used on their own or in conjunction with traditional human therapy. While Pensive is not a replacement for diagnosing or professionally treating mental health disorders, it has shown immense promise as an addition to traditional therapy and also as a personal coach to help people solve their problems.\n\nWith an average user rating of 4.9/5 stars in the App Store, it\u2019s clear that early users of this groundbreaking app are experiencing real benefits from it. Pensive is the virtual mental-health coach who\u2019s with you whenever your phone is, so you are never more than a click away from a quick session when you need it. (Also, no co-pays.)\n\nA 7-day free trial and a 50% off deal are the ideal conditions for you to download Pensive and give AI coaching a chance to improve your overall mental wellbeing. Click the link and take advantage before Jan. 1 when the 50% off deal expires.\n\nSee at Pensive"

            "article_content": "When I hear the word \"budgeting,\" I don't typically think of the word \"fun.\" While I've enjoyed test-driving popular tools such as YNAB and EveryDollar, most budgeting apps make me feel like I'm 16 years old and listening to my parents lecture me on the dangers of overspending.\n\nCleo, however, is an exception to the norm. The app makes managing your money feel more like a game with spending and saving challenges, and its sassy AI chatbot might actually make you smile. For example, it invited me to \"unfuck\" my finances\" -- a phrase that has definitely never emerged from my parents' mouths.\n\nRead on to learn more about Cleo and whether it's worth adding to your phone.\n\nCleo Like Sassy AI chatbot\n\nSassy AI chatbot Savings challenges\n\nSavings challenges Free basic budgeting features Don't like AI doesn't mean \"hands-off\"\n\nAI doesn't mean \"hands-off\" Cash advances may be too tempting\n\nCash advances may be too tempting Paid features may not be worth it\n\nHow does Cleo work?\n\nCleo feels similar to most budgeting apps when it comes to the basics of money management. You share your banking details via a secure third-party service, such as Plaid, and your transaction history automatically populates in the app's \"Spend\" tab.\n\nYou'll get a monthly breakdown in four categories: What's due, what you've saved, what you've spent and an overall limit.\n\nFor me, the most useful information came from the \"Overview\" section, which showed me my credit card spending by merchant. I knew I went to Target a lot, but I wasn't quite prepared to learn that last year, I spent more than $4,389 there.\n\nWhat sets Cleo apart is the \"Ask Cleo\" tab, which allows you to talk with an AI chatbot about your money. For example, I asked if I could afford to spend $500 on a gift, and after a quick analysis of the cash in my accounts, the chatbot told me, \"Go for it, pal.\" The bot also invites you to take a quiz to see how well you understand your finances.\n\nThe app is fun, but it's not perfect. For example, it incorrectly assumed some one-time purchases were recurring bills.\n\nCleo has a free version, which gives you basic budgeting features, as well as three paid subscription tiers:\n\nCleo Grow ($2.99 a month) offers savings challenges and access to Cleo's high-yield savings account.\n\noffers savings challenges and access to Cleo's high-yield savings account. Cleo Plus ($5.99 a month) allows you to request cash advances up to $250.\n\nallows you to request cash advances up to $250. Cleo Builder ($14.99 a month) allows you to requestcash advances up to $500 and add a secured credit card to your wallet.\n\nWhat I liked\n\nArtificial intelligence encourages real accountability: Finances can be an awkward topic, and having someone -- or something -- to hold you accountable can help you stay on track. Cleo's AI can act as that accountability partner without the discomfort that can come with normal money discussions.\n\nFinances can be an awkward topic, and having someone -- or something -- to hold you accountable can help you stay on track. Cleo's AI can act as that accountability partner without the discomfort that can come with normal money discussions. Challenges can keep you motivated: Cleo automatically reviews your transaction history to identify where you should try to spend less. For example, the app recommended I limit my Target spending to $158 for the next 14 days for an estimated savings of $40. Cleo delivered updates and encouragement throughout the challenge to encourage me to stick with it.\n\nCleo automatically reviews your transaction history to identify where you should try to spend less. For example, the app recommended I limit my Target spending to $158 for the next 14 days for an estimated savings of $40. Cleo delivered updates and encouragement throughout the challenge to encourage me to stick with it. Free features: You can automatically sync your bank accounts and get a basic understanding of your cash flow without paying anything for the app. The functionality is limited, though. For example, you can't use the challenge feature without upgrading to a paid tier. But the free version is still a valuable way to see if you like the app before signing up for a subscription.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\nAI doesn't mean you should your money on autopilot: I believe that AI can help solve some people's money problems, but it can't do it all. While I was genuinely impressed with Cleo's AI chatbot, the app's automated understanding of my bills was far from perfect. And overspending is a human problem, so you need to commit some of your own energy to make budgeting a success.\n\nI believe that AI can help solve some people's money problems, but it can't do it all. While I was genuinely impressed with Cleo's AI chatbot, the app's automated understanding of my bills was far from perfect. And overspending is a human problem, so you need to commit some of your own energy to make budgeting a success. Cash advances aren't a long-term solution: Cleo offers interest-free cash advances between $250 and $500. These can be appealing if you're struggling to make ends meet, but they won't help you learn to avoid the need for extra cash in the future. A cash advance should be a one-time necessity, not a regular solution.\n\nCleo offers interest-free cash advances between $250 and $500. These can be appealing if you're struggling to make ends meet, but they won't help you learn to avoid the need for extra cash in the future. A cash advance should be a one-time necessity, not a regular solution. Paid features may not be worth it: In addition to cash advances, the main perks of Cleo's paid tiers include access to a secured credit card and savings account. With plenty of free bank accounts and secured credit cards out there, this isn't all that unique. And while Cleo's savings account has a respectable 3.52% annual percentage yield, or APY, some of the best high-yield savings accounts pay as much as 5% APY.\n\nIs Cleo safe?\n\nYes. Cleo uses 256-bit encryption to protect your information. It also uses Plaid to sync with your bank accounts and never stores any of your banking details. In addition, the company doesn't sell your data, which means you never have to worry that your financial information will wind up in the hands of some other company trying to sell you additional products or services.\n\nWho is Cleo best suited for?\n\nIf you're bored by the usual budgeting apps or need help sticking to your spending goals, Cleo could be for you. Its fun AI chatbot and custom savings challenges can make budgeting more enjoyable and motivate you to be smarter with your money.\n\nThe app's features also feel tailored to people who haven't had a great experience with the traditional banking industry. For example, if you've struggled with overdraft fees or need help boosting your credit, Cleo's Builder tier offers cash advances and a secured credit card.\n\nAlternatives to the Cleo app\n\nThere are plenty of other budgeting apps worth considering if Cleo isn't right for you. For example, Rocket Money has plenty of features and an easy-to-use interface for free or as little as $6 a month.\n\nIf you're attracted to Cleo's cash advances and savings account, you might enjoy Chime. Chime is a banking app rather than a budgeting app, but it offers a secured credit card, a checking account and a high-yield savings account -- without the need to pay monthly fees. Plus, its MyPay tool allows you to access up to $500 of your paycheck early, free of charge. (Unless you need the cash immediately, in which case there's a $2 fee).\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Cleo legit? Yes. Cleo has been in business since 2016 and available in the US since 2018. According to the company's latest figures, more than five million people use the app. Cleo partners with Thread Bank for its savings account and WebBank for its secured credit card.\n\nHow much does Cleo cost? Cleo has a free version with limited functionality. To take advantage of more of the app's features, you can upgrade to one of the three paid tiers. Cleo Grow costs $2.99 a month and includes the ability to create challenges, round up spending and open a linked high-yield savings account. Cleo Plus costs $5.99 a month and offers cash advances up to $250. Cleo Builder costs $14.99 a month and includes a secured credit card, priority customer support and cash advances up to $500.\n\nIs Cleo worth paying for? With 4.6 out of 5 stars on the App Store and 4.3 on Google Play, it's clear that a lot of people love Cleo. Its AI chatbot is a useful way to learn more about your finances, and its casual tone injects some fun into budgeting. That said, you can get many of the premium services Cleo offers without a monthly fee. For example, Chime's Credit Builder Card has no annual fee, and the financial tech company's online checking account offers a $500 payday advance option for eligible users -- all at no extra cost. So, if you're thinking of springing for one of Cleo's pricier subscriptions, you may want to weigh your options.\n\nMore budgeting apps"

            "article_content": "Increasingly, over the last few decades, modern pop culture has warmed up to embracing the frightful chills of the winter holidays in films like Gremlins, Black Christmas, Terrifier 3 \u2026 Love Actually. But the historical roots of this time of year have always had a darker, spookier side. Long before Charles Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol \u2014 an era when families of Victorian England gathered to share ghost stories by the fire on Christmas Eve \u2014 pre-Christian folklore told of a thin veil between worlds, where spirits (and goblins, beasts, and gods) lingered during the winter solstice.\n\nThose ancient beliefs blend with modern natural introspection of the holidays. Along with the (sometimes saccharine) jubilations, Christmas and the winter festivities encourage people to reflect on the past, lost loved ones, and the lingering \u201cghosts\u201d of memory. Add to that how this month is populated by magical home invaders, and a creepy surveillance imp on the shelf, and December is a rather fitting time for mystery, the macabre, and paranormal tales.\n\nCelebrating the scarier side of the holidays is not only a sort of subversive counter-programming by pairing cheer with fear, it allows us to acknowledge the dichotomy of light and dark, contrasting cozy, nostalgic evenings with long, eerily silent nights.\n\nAll of this is a very drawn out way of saying I love getting creepy, spooky, and downright scary gifts for the holidays, and I love shopping for loved ones who also appreciate a little splash of blood red with their Christmases so white. And so, we return with a Talking Strange Show \u201cSeason\u2019s Screamings Gift Guide\u201d for 2024. After the success of last year\u2019s guide, we are going bigger and bloodier with gift suggestions for the horror and paranormal fans in your life. Comic books, action figures, statues, graphic novels, swanky shirts and hats, paranormal investigation equipment, and even some vodka and cologne are all included, and all part of the theme."

            "article_content": "Imagine knowing you\u2019ve already made an important contribution to biomedical research before you\u2019ve even started high school. This is a reality for a young Chicago student who recently found a bacterium that exhibits antibiotic activity and produces a novel compound that slows the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells in the lab. Where did this startling discovery come from? Well, goose poop of course.\n\nThis budding young middle school scientist was part of a community partnership with a local university that engages kids from underrepresented and low-income backgrounds. The team partnered with Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, which allowed them to engage with middle schoolers as part of a 14-week applied science program.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nInequality in educational resources, especially for STEM subjects, has often prevented some students from accessing these fields when they\u2019re older. However, a team from the University of Illinois at Chicago, led by Brian Murphy, has established a partnership that engages such groups at an early stage in their educational development. The hope is that, by providing them with a chance to conduct real, high-quality research, these young students will come to see themselves as scientists and explore related careers in the future.\n\nAs Murphy\u2019s lab is focused on finding antibiotics from natural sources, the students helped scour their local communities for environmental samples. Before someone suggests this was just a way to outsource sample gathering, the students then followed up on the stages of scientific processing, especially for programming a specialized robot that removes bacterial colonies from growth plates and tests them for antibiotic activity.\n\n\u201cAll experiments are performed under the guidance of graduate student or postdoctoral scientist volunteer mentors\u201d, the researchers explain in their study.\n\n\u201cEach student collected 3 samples of their choice from Garfield Park in Chicago, IL. Students pretreated and diluted their samples before plating each one on three different media types [....] While their bacteria incubated, they practiced block programming on LEGO EV3 modules in preparation for robot operation. When their environmental diversity plates exhibited sufficient bacterial growth, students programmed and operated the Hudson Robotics RapidPickMP to pick all distinguishable colonies from their environmental diversity plates and transfer them onto dual-sided agar plate assay (DAPA) bioassay plates.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDuring their search, one student returned with a sample of goose poop that contained a strain of bacteria called Pseudomonas idahonensis \u2013 a species that had previously been isolated from rainbow trout in Idaho (idahonensis means \u201cfrom Idaho). The student, Camarria Williams, and Jonathon Rodriguez, Technology Program Manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, are listed as co-authors of the paper\n\nIt was concluded that this bacterium had antibiotic activity and even produced a completely new-to-science compound. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry, the university researchers were able to determine that orfamide N was not actually responsible for the antibiotic activity observed before. However, the compound did hinder the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells when it was tested in the laboratory.\n\nIt is believed that further testing could reveal additional advantageous properties of this new molecule.\n\nThis project demonstrates that it is possible to combine educational outreach with natural product discovery research while also showing how important it is to develop strong relationships between universities and local communities. In particular, it offers typically under-represented students a chance to be scientists themselves and to make incredible discoveries like this!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGuess we should also thank the goose for providing its poop as well.\n\nThe study is published in the journal ACS Omega."

            "article_content": "A former OpenAI employee, Suchir Balaji, was recently found dead in his San Francisco apartment, according to the San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. In October, the 26-year-old AI researcher raised concerns about OpenAI breaking copyright law when he was interviewed by The New York Times.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) has identified the decedent as Suchir Balaji, 26, of San Francisco. The manner of death has been determined to be suicide,\u201d said a spokesperson in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cThe OCME has notified the next-of-kin and has no further comment or reports for publication at this time.\u201d\n\nAfter nearly four years working at OpenAI, Balaji quit the company when he realized the technology would bring more harm than good to society, he told The New York Times. Balaji\u2019s main concern was the way OpenAI allegedly used copyright data, and he believed its practices were damaging to the internet.\n\n\u201cWe are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news today and our hearts go out to Suchir\u2019s loved ones during this difficult time,\u201d said an OpenAI spokesperson in an email to TechCrunch.\n\nBalaji was found dead in his Buchanan Street apartment on November 26, a spokesperson for the San Francisco Police Department told TechCrunch. Officers and medics were called to his residence in the city\u2019s Lower Haight district to perform a wellness check on the former OpenAI researcher. No evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation, according to police.\n\n\u201cI was at OpenAI for nearly 4 years and worked on ChatGPT for the last 1.5 of them,\u201d said Balaji in a tweet from October. \u201cI initially didn\u2019t know much about copyright, fair use, etc. but became curious after seeing all the lawsuits filed against GenAI companies. When I tried to understand the issue better, I eventually came to the conclusion that fair use seems like a pretty implausible defense for a lot of generative AI products, for the basic reason that they can create substitutes that compete with the data they\u2019re trained on.\u201d\n\nBalaji\u2019s death was first reported by the San Jose Mercury News.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft are currently involved with several ongoing lawsuits from newspapers and media publishers, including the New York Times, who claim the generative AI startup has broken copyright law.\n\nOn November 25, one day before police found Balaji\u2019s body, a court filing named the former OpenAI employee in a copyright lawsuit brought against the startup. As part of a good faith compromise, OpenAI agreed to search Balaji\u2019s custodial file related to the copyright concerns he had recently raised.\n\nSeveral former OpenAI employees have raised concerns about the startup\u2019s safety culture, but Balaji was one of the few who took issue with the data that OpenAI trained its models on. In a blog post from October, the former OpenAI researcher wrote that he didn\u2019t believe ChatGPT was a fair use of its training data; however, similar arguments could be made for many generative AI products, he said.\n\nBefore working at OpenAI, the 26-year-old researcher studied computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. During college, he interned at OpenAI and Scale AI, the former of which he would go on to work for.\n\nBalaji worked on WebGPT during his early days at OpenAI, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3 that could search the web. It was an early version of SearchGPT, which OpenAI released earlier this year. Later on, Balaji worked on the pretraining team for GPT-4, reasoning team with o1, and post-training for ChatGPT, according to his LinkedIn.\n\nSeveral of Balaji\u2019s former peers and colleagues in the AI world took to social media to mourn his loss.\n\nThis is incredibly sad news. Suchir was kind and thoughtful, and his speaking out on AI and copyright was hugely appreciated by a lot of people. He will be greatly missed.https://t.co/gYTbHB1Jme \u2014 Ed Newton-Rex (@ednewtonrex) December 13, 2024\n\nSuchir Balaji was a good young man. I spoke to him six weeks ago. He had left OpenAI and wanted to make the world a better place.\n\n\n\nThis is tragic. https://t.co/1Jqwd26QPd \u2014 Gary Marcus (@GaryMarcus) December 14, 2024"

Here\u2019s how to submit a claim.\n\nVERIFY often fact-checks settlement notices so our readers know whether they are legitimate or fraudulent.\n\nSome people, including a VERIFY journalist, received emails in December notifying them about a ParkMobile class action settlement due to a data breach. ParkMobile is a mobile parking payment app that is used in many U.S. states.\n\nGoogle Trends data show many people online are wondering if the ParkMobile data breach settlement is legitimate.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nIs the ParkMobile data breach settlement real?\n\nTHE SOURCES\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nYes, the ParkMobile data breach settlement is real.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nParkMobile customers who were notified about the parking app\u2019s 2021 data breach could receive up to $25 as part of a proposed class action settlement.\n\nThe parking payment app company agreed to a $32.8 million settlement following a 2021 lawsuit alleging it failed to protect people\u2019s personal information, court records show. ParkMobile denied any wrongdoing or liability, an official settlement website says.\n\nParkMobile also acknowledged the settlement and linked out to the official website on Dec. 5.\n\nA class action lawsuit was filed in Georgia about two months after ParkMobile confirmed a \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d linked to a third-party software in March 2021. The lawsuit alleges that about 21 million users\u2019 personal information was compromised in the data breach.\n\nAccording to ParkMobile, the leaked information included license plate numbers, email addresses, phone numbers and mailing addresses, as well as encrypted passwords but not the encryption keys required to read them. Users\u2019 credit card numbers were not leaked, the company said.\n\nWho qualifies for the settlement\n\nAnyone who received a notice from ParkMobile about the 2021 data security incident is eligible to submit a claim, according to the official website. People who are eligible also should have received an emailed notice about the class action settlement.\n\nIf you are still unsure about whether you\u2019re eligible for the settlement, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at 1-866-944-4062.\n\nAccording to the official website, $9 million of the proposed settlement has been set aside for cash payments to people affected by the data breach. The amount of money each person can receive is capped at $25, the website says.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t submit claims for cash payments will receive $1 credits from ParkMobile via email.\n\nHow to submit a claim\n\nPeople who are eligible for the settlement must submit a claim by Wednesday, March 5, 2025, the settlement website says.\n\nYou can submit a claim online using the ID and confirmation code on your mailed or emailed notice. If you don\u2019t have the notice ID and confirmation code, you can look up your login by entering your name and email address.\n\nYou can also print out a claim form here and mail it postmarked no later than March 5 to this address: ParkMobile Data Security Incident, Attn: Claim Forms, 1650 Arch Street, Suite 2210, Philadelphia, PA 19103.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when people who are eligible for the settlement could receive their payments."

            "article_content": "In 2024, researchers turned up possible evidence of ancient life on Mars, hints that Alzheimer\u2019s disease can spread from person-to-person and a slew of other scientific findings that could be a big deal \u2014 if they\u2019re the real deal.\n\nMartian microbes, maybe\n\nAlien microbes may have once made their home on Mars (SN: 8/24/24, p. 6). In July, NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover uncovered a rock on the Red Planet that sports white spots with black rings laced with iron phosphate (see Page 28). On Earth, such specks have been linked to ancient micro\u00adbial life. But they\u2019re not surefire signs of microbes. The only way to know for certain is to bring the rock back to Earth for closer inspection.\n\nNASA\u2019s Perseverance rover discovered leopard spot\u2013like features in this Martian rock (closeup image shown). On Earth, similar structures are associated with microbial life. MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASA\n\nSparking superconductivity\n\nLight may be the secret ingredient for making superconductors that don\u2019t require frigid conditions. In an experiment, blasting a copper and oxygen compound with a laser caused the material to throw off magnetic fields. That magnetism, the scientists say, is a smoking gun for superconductivity \u2014 the ability to ferry electricity with no resistance (SN: 8/10/24, p. 6). But skeptics contend that those magnetic fields might have arisen from some other, unknown physics.\n\nIn experiments, a compound made of copper and oxygen atoms (blue and red spheres in this illustration) blasted with laser light (red) threw off magnetic fields (blue). This effect signals that the compound transformed into a superconductor, some physicists say. Sebastian Fava, J\u00f6rg M. Harms\n\nAncient engineering\n\nBuilders used a water-powered elevator to construct Egypt\u2019s first pyramid nearly 4,700 years ago, researchers propose (SN: 9/7/24 & 9/21/24, p. 11). That controversial idea is based on a computer model of structures in and around the Step Pyramid of Djoser. Controlling the flow of floodwater in and out of a shaft inside the pyramid could have lifted and lowered a block-hoisting platform, the model shows. But critics argue that occasional rains wouldn\u2019t have supplied enough water to sustain such a system.\n\nAncient workers could have built Egyptian King Djoser\u2019s pyramid (shown) using a water-powered elevator to hoist the heavy stone blocks, a computer simulation suggests. But not all archaeologists are on board with the idea. Anton Petrus/Moment/Getty Images\n\nTectonic shake-up\n\nPlate tectonics got off to an early start in Earth\u2019s history, a rock in South Africa suggests. Layers in the rock bear scars of 3-billion-year-old landslides that may have been caused by an earthquake (SN: 4/6/24, p. 6). That quake, scientists say, could have been triggered by slabs of crust colliding. The finding lends support to the contested idea that plate tectonics dates back more than 2.8 billion years. But other geologists are not convinced that this quake marks the start of global plate tectonics.\n\nLayers of rock at the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa contain hints of a huge earthquake triggered by plate tectonics more than 3 billion years ago. Simon Lamb\n\nMedium size, maximum hype\n\nFor the first time, astronomers may have spotted a midsize black hole in our galaxy (SN: 8/10/24, p. 7). Telescope data suggest that a black hole at least 8,200 times as massive as the sun lurks in the star cluster Omega Centauri. But another study disputes the claim. Instead, the star cluster could harbor a horde of smaller black holes (SN: 8/20/24).\n\nIf a rare midsize black hole truly does lurk in the heart of the Omega Centauri star cluster, it would be the first black hole of its size found in the Milky Way. In this Hubble Space Telescope image, the supposed black hole\u2019s location is marked by the white box. Hubble/ESA, NASA, M. H\u00e4berle/MPIA\n\nTransmissible Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is not contagious in everyday life, but under extremely rare conditions, it may spread from one person to another (SN: 2/24/24, p. 6). Five people who in childhood received contaminated growth hormone injections later developed early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 most likely because the hormones were tainted with amyloid-beta, a protein whose buildup is linked to the disease, researchers say. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether the growth hormones are to blame, other experts note. Perhaps the health conditions that those hormones were meant to treat or other medical procedures led to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s in these patients.\n\nHigh levels of the protein amyloid-beta \u2014 a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 appear orange and purple in this brain scan of a man with the disease. Childhood exposure to the protein via contaminated growth hormone injections may have led the man to develop Alzheimer\u2019s later in life. G. Banerjee et al/Nature Medicine 2024\n\nShedding light on dark energy\n\nDark energy may have gotten even more mysterious. The enigmatic stuff, which makes up the bulk of the cosmos, is generally thought to maintain a constant density. But new observations of 6.4 million galaxies and quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, or DESI, paired with data on exploding stars, cast doubt on that idea. These data more closely fit a model of the universe in which the relationship between dark energy\u2019s density and its pressure changes over time (SN: 5/4/24 & 5/18/24, p. 6). If confirmed, this finding would rewrite the history of the universe. Experts are withholding judgment until DESI completes its survey of over 30 million other galaxies (SN: 12/14/24 & 12/28/24, p. 7)."

            "article_content": "Imagine knowing you\u2019ve already made an important contribution to biomedical research before you\u2019ve even started high school. This is a reality for a young Chicago student who recently found a bacterium that exhibits antibiotic activity and produces a novel compound that slows the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells in the lab. Where did this startling discovery come from? Well, goose poop of course.\n\nThis budding young middle school scientist was part of a community partnership with a local university that engages kids from underrepresented and low-income backgrounds. The team partnered with Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, which allowed them to engage with middle schoolers as part of a 14-week applied science program.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nInequality in educational resources, especially for STEM subjects, has often prevented some students from accessing these fields when they\u2019re older. However, a team from the University of Illinois at Chicago, led by Brian Murphy, has established a partnership that engages such groups at an early stage in their educational development. The hope is that, by providing them with a chance to conduct real, high-quality research, these young students will come to see themselves as scientists and explore related careers in the future.\n\nAs Murphy\u2019s lab is focused on finding antibiotics from natural sources, the students helped scour their local communities for environmental samples. Before someone suggests this was just a way to outsource sample gathering, the students then followed up on the stages of scientific processing, especially for programming a specialized robot that removes bacterial colonies from growth plates and tests them for antibiotic activity.\n\n\u201cAll experiments are performed under the guidance of graduate student or postdoctoral scientist volunteer mentors\u201d, the researchers explain in their study.\n\n\u201cEach student collected 3 samples of their choice from Garfield Park in Chicago, IL. Students pretreated and diluted their samples before plating each one on three different media types [....] While their bacteria incubated, they practiced block programming on LEGO EV3 modules in preparation for robot operation. When their environmental diversity plates exhibited sufficient bacterial growth, students programmed and operated the Hudson Robotics RapidPickMP to pick all distinguishable colonies from their environmental diversity plates and transfer them onto dual-sided agar plate assay (DAPA) bioassay plates.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDuring their search, one student returned with a sample of goose poop that contained a strain of bacteria called Pseudomonas idahonensis \u2013 a species that had previously been isolated from rainbow trout in Idaho (idahonensis means \u201cfrom Idaho). The student, Camarria Williams, and Jonathon Rodriguez, Technology Program Manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, are listed as co-authors of the paper\n\nIt was concluded that this bacterium had antibiotic activity and even produced a completely new-to-science compound. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry, the university researchers were able to determine that orfamide N was not actually responsible for the antibiotic activity observed before. However, the compound did hinder the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells when it was tested in the laboratory.\n\nIt is believed that further testing could reveal additional advantageous properties of this new molecule.\n\nThis project demonstrates that it is possible to combine educational outreach with natural product discovery research while also showing how important it is to develop strong relationships between universities and local communities. In particular, it offers typically under-represented students a chance to be scientists themselves and to make incredible discoveries like this!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGuess we should also thank the goose for providing its poop as well.\n\nThe study is published in the journal ACS Omega."

            "article_content": "Standing Up for Science with Science Communication\n\nURBANA, Illinois, US, Dec 13 2024 (IPS) - New research shows that AI-generated summaries of scientific writing made the information more approachable and easier to understand, and thus created more public engagement with the information. This is notable because most scientists aren\u2019t trained in science communication tactics and so their jargon affects many people\u2019s ability to understand and trust scientific papers and findings.\n\nScience communication has always been an important part of the scientific process because discoveries, solutions and findings that can help solve our world\u2019s greatest challenges cannot be adopted or understood by the public without clear communication. Communicating science well also can shape and inform public policy.\n\nScientists, therefore, have a responsibility to make sure that they communicate their knowledge and findings in a way that the public and policymakers can understand, but too often that is not happening.\n\nScientists have a responsibility to make sure that they communicate their knowledge and findings in a way that the public and policymakers can understand, but too often that is not happening\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the importance of science communication, it is necessary for scientists to be trained in science communication. That is why I started a science communications course at my university.\n\nI have taught it for over 4 years and cover topics like the art of writing opinion pieces and creating science stories, communicating science to different audiences through careful use of metaphors and minimal use of jargon.\n\nAdditionally, the class covers topics such as communicating science using social media and communicating with politicians and creating visual science stories. Students who have taken the class have continued to use the skills learned in class in their careers while others went on to become science communicators\n\nThe people who need to learn these skills include recent PhD graduates, post-doctoral fellows, assistant professors, newly tenured and full professors.\n\nThere are several resources including textbooks, science communication workshops, and many trusted organizations and institutions to which scientists can turn. Science communication newbies can also turn to social media including Bluesky social and Instagram to meet other science communication enthusiasts.\n\nNotably, there are institutions and organizations to which scientists can turn. The American Association for the Advancement of Science, for example has developed a communication toolkit to help science communication newbies.\n\nThe OpED project has programs to help people learn how to write OpEds and a few times a year, they offer science communication workshops. Moreover, most universities also have webpages listing science communication resources.\n\nFor example, Duke University has a webpage listing the resources available including science communication workshops, events and classes.\n\nCommunicating science effectively via OpEds, blogs, and social media outlets is not only important for reaching the public and policy makers, but it can help scientists themselves, too.\n\nFirst, through public publishing and engagement, scientists can establish their own reputation. Journalists and policymakers will often reach out to whatever expert they can easily find, and being active on social media and op-ed pages will make a person easier to find.\n\nBeing a consistent public voice \u2013 backed up by good work \u2013 can help establish someone as an expert in their field. Moreover, scientists that regularly and consistently participate in science communication can track its impact and include that on tenure promotion packages.\n\nThis happened to me. Being consistent with writing over 150 OpEds, since 2015, for example has helped to advance my career.\n\nSecond, communicating science publicly help a person build a professional network, which can lead to peers reaching out for collaborations and co-writing of grant proposals.\n\nIt can lead to people recommending each other for awards or invitations to speak on panels, workshops or to give plenary talks.\n\nThis has been my experience, and I\u2019ve received a few invitations thanks to my public writing. For instance, I was invited to give a plenary talk at the annual 2019 British Ecological Society, and I\u2019ve been invited to speak at various universities.\n\nIn 2021, I was awarded the American Association for the Advancement of Science Mani L. Bhaumik Award for Public Engagement with Science.\n\nThird, communicating science can help a scientist grow their skills and become better at speaking and writing in publicly accessible language. And it can help scientists learn to become better at capitalizing on newsworthy moments. In addition, this can also facilitate the building of trust among different communities and the public.\n\nFourth, it can allow scientists to offer a public service and provide accurate information about their discoveries and recent scientific and technological advancements to reporters and policymakers.\n\nOf course, for new beginners, it can be overwhelming to join the science communication bandwagon. Not only may it be unfamiliar and a new skill to develop, but there are concerns like being unable to control what happens to your writing or how it is used once it\u2019s published, or the fact that science is ever evolving, and new information may agree or disagree with previously held truths. But the benefits outweigh the negatives.\n\nScience communication is critical for conveying important scientific information. Scientists must stand up for science. When scientists become better science communicators, the public, society, and scientists benefit.\n\nEsther Ngumbi, PhD is Assistant Professor, Department of Entomology, African American Studies Department, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"

            "article_content": "Run by the team at orchestration, AI, and automation platform Tines, the Tines library contains pre-built workflows shared by real security practitioners from across the community, all of which are free to import and deploy via the Community Edition of the platform.\n\nTheir bi-annual \"You Did What with Tines?!\" competition highlights some of the most interesting workflows submitted by their users, many of which demonstrate practical applications of large language models (LLMs) to address complex challenges in security operations.\n\nOne recent winner is a workflow designed to automate CrowdStrike RFM reporting. Developed by Tom Power, a security analyst at The University of British Columbia, it uses orchestration, AI and automation to reduce the time spent on manual reporting.\n\nHere, we'll share an overview of the workflow, plus a step-by-step guide for getting it up and running.\n\nThe problem - time-consuming reporting\n\nThe workflow's builder, Tom Power, explains, \"The CrowdStrike Falcon sensor goes into Reduced Functionality Mode (RFM), usually because the operating system (OS) or kernel version is too old or too new for the sensor to support in kernel mode. Every week, SecOps would log into the Falcon console, and filter the host management console for endpoints in RFM for the last week. We would generate the report and download it.\"\n\nThis process provided critical data for identifying kernel updates causing RFM, particularly for Linux endpoints. However, it required the team to manually check whether CrowdStrike had released a new sensor version compatible with the latest kernel updates.\n\n\"The entire process took about 30 minutes each week,\" Tom adds. \"Over the course of a year, that added up to more than 25 hours of time we could have spent on other cybersecurity priorities.\"\n\nThe solution - automated RFM reporting with AI\n\nTom's workflow automates the tracking and reporting of Falcon Sensor RFM across hosts. By leveraging Tines' AI-driven Automatic Mode, it generates custom code to streamline report creation. The workflow not only produces regular, consistent reports but also enables management to monitor trends in RFM occurrences, supporting proactive system health management and faster decision-making.\n\nThe automated workflow eliminates the need for manual reporting by allowing analysts to submit requests via a simple web form. Within minutes, the workflow retrieves data, processes it, and delivers an actionable email report, complete with detailed insights and a CSV attachment.\n\nExample output:\n\nHere's a sample of the auto-generated email and report received by the team:\n\nHere are some of the key benefits of using this workflow:\n\nFrees analysts to focus on high-priority cybersecurity tasks.\n\nReduces manual effort and the potential for human error.\n\nDelivers consistent, reliable reports for improved productivity.\n\nEnhances decision-making by providing real-time insights.\n\nBoosts morale by removing a tedious and repetitive task.\n\nWorkflow overview\n\nTools used:\n\nTines - a workflow orchestration, AI and automation platform that's popular with security teams. It's possible to use the free Community Edition of Tines to build and run this workflow if you don't have a paid account. AI must be enabled on your tenant.\n\nCrowdStrike - endpoint detection and response (EDR) platform. This workflow integrates with CrowdStrike Falcon's API to retrieve data about endpoints in Reduced Functionality Mode (RFM). While Falcon provides robust endpoint visibility, it lacks native automation for recurring RFM reports.\n\nThe workflow is initiated when a web form is submitted, triggering the process to generate CrowdStrike RFM reports.\n\nThe first action retrieves a list of device IDs from CrowdStrike Falcon's API. If the list is larger than what CrowdStrike returns in the first batch, multiple calls are made to paginate through the full list.\n\nOnce all the device details are retrieved, the workflow consolidates them into a single resource. This resource acts as the foundation for analysis, where the number of Linux, Windows, and Mac hosts is calculated and appended to the data.\n\nUsing the consolidated resource, the workflow generates an HTML summary table to present the data in a structured format. This table is then converted into a CSV file, making it suitable for reporting purposes.\n\nThe CSV report is emailed to stakeholders for review. To maintain efficiency and data hygiene, the workflow purges the temporary resource after the email is sent, ensuring it is ready for the next cycle.\n\nBy automating these steps, the workflow eliminates manual effort, reduces the risk of errors, and provides consistent, up-to-date reporting on devices in reduced functionality mode across the environment.\n\nConfiguring the workflow - step-by-step guide\n\nLog into Tines or create a new account. Ensure AI is enabled on your tenant. For this, you need to be the tenant owner. Select the account settings drop-down in the top left of your screen, and check the box to turn AI on. Create your CrowdStrike credential. From the credentials page, select New credential, scroll down to the CrowdStrike credential and complete the required fields. Navigate to the pre-built workflow in the library. Select import. This should take you straight to your new pre-built workflow. Configure your actions. For example, you may like to edit the layout of the Tines page that kicks off the workflow. Test the workflow. Submit an image via the form to test your workflow. Publish your workflow and share the Page URL with your desired users.\n\nBuilding in other automation platforms\n\nYou could use another no-code automation platform to build a similar service, although it's worth noting that some of the features in this workflow are unique to Tines:\n\nPages: This workflow is kicked off by a submission to a form on a web page. This is built using Tines' Pages feature. Alternative: Use a scheduled trigger to kick off the workflow.\n\nThis workflow is kicked off by a submission to a form on a web page.

It\u2019s perfect if you need an organized and flexible way to manage work for your in-house team, freelancers, agencies, and even other departments.\n\nmonday.com has a free plan for up to two users. It\u2019s limited, but it is a good place to start if you want to try it out before paying.\n\nMore on monday.com: monday.com Review | monday.com vs Jira | monday.com vs. Notion.\n\nTo start, you\u2019ll need to add all of your resources, including freelancers and in-house team members if you\u2019re managing their work here too. From there, you can invite as many guest users as you need to at no extra cost.\n\nOnce they\u2019re onboarded, you can start assigning tasks. They will be able to track their time, monitor deadlines, upload files, leave comments, and more.\n\nThe best part about this template is how it brings all of your outsourced tasks together. You\u2019ll easily be able to keep track of everything happening outside the company in one place. Each task can have its own status, allocated amount of time, due date, owner, and assignee.\n\nIt\u2019s simple, yet effective. You can also add additional columns if you need to.\n\nmonday.com makes it easy to control access and editing capabilities so you don\u2019t have to worry about freelancers being able to see things you don\u2019t want them to.\n\nClickUp: A Kanban-style freelancer management template\n\nClickUp is another powerful option if you want a complete project management solution.\n\nIts generous free plan includes collaborative document sharing, whiteboard features, sprint management, calendar views, and Kanban boards. It\u2019s more than enough to get started and many smaller businesses can stay on the free plan for quite some time.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to invite as many free users as you\u2019d like, just keep in mind that you won\u2019t have granular access controls unless you upgrade.\n\nMore on ClickUp: ClickUp Review | ClickUp vs Asana | ClickUp vs. Notion.\n\nKanban boards are simple, familiar, and highly visual \u2014 they\u2019re great for managing projects and tasks, especially those you\u2019re outsourcing to a contractor. They likely won\u2019t have to learn a new system or wonder how it works.\n\nAll you have to do is create a backlog of tasks, assign them, set due dates, and invite them to collaborate with you on ClickUp.\n\nThey\u2019ll be able to manage their work, mark tasks as complete, leave comments, ask questions, collaborate on documents, chat with you, and more.\n\nIt takes just a few minutes to configure everything if you\u2019re using this template as is. Otherwise, it may take up to an hour to customize it to match your needs. You can adjust the columns, fields that show on each card, what it looks like when you open a card, and just about every other element.\n\nYou can even turn off features you aren\u2019t going to use. This ensures nobody uses them by accident.\n\nKnack: Manage projects, resumes, and invoices in one place\n\nKnack is a no-code development platform that\u2019s great for companies who want to create their own custom apps. You can use it to build web portals, databases, project trackers, and even a directory to manage all of your freelancers.\n\nThere\u2019s no free plan, but there is a 14-day free trial if you want to try it before you invest. Plans start at $59 per month.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit pricey, but it\u2019s worth it if you need the level of customization it provides.\n\nThis template is great if you need a full system to manage freelancer projects and tasks, invoices, service agreements, and resumes.\n\nIt allows you to create a complete directory of every freelancer you\u2019ve ever worked with. This can be useful if you want to have an approved list of contractors or a large pool of freelancers you can pick from at any time.\n\nIt\u2019s also invaluable if you do a lot of recruiting or cycling through.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to categorize your directory based on their skills, experience level, type of agreement, or any other custom attribute you\u2019d like. This makes it easy to find exactly what you need when you need it.\n\nContractors will be able to send invoices and even add a portfolio of their work directly within the platform. They have full access to their profiles and can update them any time.\n\nThe downside of this template is how much upfront work is required. You\u2019ll likely have to do a bit of customizing, training, and tweaking before you start using it. Building a custom no-code app is always more challenging than you think it\u2019ll be.\n\nBut it definitely pays off if you need it.\n\nAirtable: A comprehensive freelancer management database\n\nAs a powerful relational database builder, Airtable makes it easy for non-developers to build systems, including a freelancer management database. On top of that, you can utilize automations to streamline notifications, task assignments, and more.\n\nAirtable\u2019s free plan supports up to 1,000 records per base, which is more than enough to start.\n\nMore on Airtable: Airtable Review | Airtable vs Asana | Airtable vs Trello.\n\nThis template comes with prebuilt tables for contractors, assignments, projects, and your internal team. Although it\u2019s technically for managing contractors and their work, you can use it to manage in-house projects and tasks in the same place without making too many adjustments.\n\nFor each contractor, you can add their area of expertise, occupation, portfolio, work link, contact, secondary specializations, approval status, and contact information.\n\nOut of the box, it covers everything you need to know about each freelancer. It even has a specific view for tracking them through your recruitment pipeline.\n\nOnce on board, you can associate contractors with their assignments, set due dates, explain project scope, attach your contact, and any other details you may need.\n\nAirtable\u2019s flexibility means you can add new fields, remove fields, or edit existing fields to make it work for you.\n\nWith each assignment, the manager will be able to add feedback. Over time, you can use this to determine if you want to keep working with specific freelancers.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s flexible and powerful if you want to do a lot of customizing.\n\nAsana: A simpler freelancer management template for small to mid-sized teams\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve covered incredibly flexible and powerful project management options. Asana isn\u2019t as flexible, but is much easier to use. It has a rigid hierarchy and eliminates the problem of there being dozens of different ways to accomplish the same thing.\n\nOut of the box, it\u2019s ready to go without much reconfiguring. Its free plan is also one of the best, allowing for unlimited tasks, projects, and storage for up to ten users.\n\nMore on Asana: Asana Review | Asana vs Basecamp | Asana vs Wrike.\n\nAfter adding this template to your account, you\u2019ll start with creating a list of your freelancers. You\u2019ll be able to save their contact information, rates, areas of expertise, and past projects. This is a great resource as your contractor pool grows larger.\n\nFrom there, you can assign work, share documents, set due dates, and collaborate directly within Asana.\n\nUsers will be able to sort and group tasks however they\u2019d like, and there are numerous different views they can choose from \u2014 List, board, timeline, and calendar to name a few.\n\nBut perhaps the best part of this template (and Asana in general) is that each project has a dedicated message board. This means freelancers can message your team and anyone on the project can respond.\n\nManagers and supervisors will also appreciate its built in automation rules and customizable dashboards.\n\nExcel, PDF, and Google Docs freelancer management templates\n\nIf you\u2019re working with a handful of contractors and don\u2019t need a system for collaborative task tracking, you can use a spreadsheet or document to stay organized.\n\nEven if you decide to use a more comprehensive platform for managing your freelancers, each of the templates below can still be a useful resource.\n\nTemplate 1: A freelancer invoicing template (PDF or Excel)\n\nIt may sound obvious, but requiring freelancers to use your invoicing template goes a long way in ensuring each invoice includes all the details you need. I used to let freelancers invoice however they\u2019d like and it wasn\u2019t until I brought a controller on board that I realized I needed a more standardized way.\n\nAside from standardization, your team will be able to process them faster and avoid common errors when issuing payments.\n\nThey\u2019ll know how to spot problems early to ensure everyone still gets paid on time.\n\nThis free HubSpot template is available as a PDF or Excel file. All you have to do is provide your email address and a few details about your business.\n\nFile in hand, you can start by filling out your company information, like your name, address, phone number, and email.\n\nFrom there, you can provide a copy to each of your freelancers. They\u2019ll be able to duplicate it and fill in their own information before submitting it to you for payment.\n\nThere\u2019s an area to describe the scope of work, list each task completed, and calculate total amount due based on hours worked and their hourly rate. You can easily update this if you charge by project or deliverable instead.\n\nAt the bottom, freelancers can also add a tax rate, discount, or shipping and handling fees if needed.\n\nTemplate 2: A one-page project brief template (Google Docs)\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a simple, reusable template you can use to assign work to a freelancer, this free Google Docs template from TeamGantt is a great option.\n\nIt\u2019s straightforward and incredibly simple, but outlining priorities, expectations, and requirements up front often leads to better outcomes. This is especially true when working with freelancers who may not have the same level of context as your in-house team.\n\nThis template allows you to summarize your goals and provide the context contractors need to meet your expectations. From there, you can break it down further into tasks and deliverables you need from them.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to add screenshots and images if needed, which can be helpful for demonstrating what you\u2019re after or providing instructions if needed.\n\nThere\u2019s also an area to define what is out of scope. This can be incredibly helpful from the freelancer\u2019s perspective \u2014 it lets them know what you\u2019ve thought about and don\u2019t need from them. In many cases, knowing what\u2019s out of scope is more helpful than understanding what you need.\n\nIn the sidebar, you can add contact information for key stakeholders and others involved in the project. This lets them know who to talk to if they have questions.\n\nYou can download this template in landscape or portrait orientation, depending on your preferences. You\u2019ll also be able to copy it as many times as needed.\n\nHow to choose a freelancer management template\n\nUnless your needs are incredibly basic, I suggest reframing this question \u2014 instead of choosing a template, think about choosing a platform that will work well for what you need. From there, you can download their freelancer management template into your account and get started.\n\nThat said, here are some factors to keep in mind as you make your decision.\n\nLevel of detail\n\nHow much information do you need to capture? Some templates cover the basics, like email, phone number, and pay rate. Others are highly sophisticated and cover previous work history, rating systems, active status, and more.\n\nSome may even let freelancers set up a profile, submit invoices, message your team, and more.\n\nAs I mentioned, each template\u2019s capabilities are heavily influenced by the platform rather than the template itself.\n\nYou\u2019ll likely be able to add, remove, and update as needed but core functionality isn\u2019t something you can change.\n\nProject management capabilities\n\nIf you want to streamline how you assign work to your freelancers, you\u2019ll need more than just a database of their contact information. Think about the project management style you want to use and which types of project boards you\u2019ll need to facilitate this work.\n\nSome project management systems double as freelancer databases, while others don\u2019t have the best database but shine when it comes to tracking tasks.\n\nScalability\n\nThink about the number of freelancers you\u2019re currently working with and how many you\u2019re planning to work with moving forward. Some templates work best for small teams while others can accommodate upwards of 50+ freelancers.\n\nBest practices for managing freelancers\n\nI\u2019ve been working with freelancers for the majority of my career. Over the years, I\u2019ve learned a lot about what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nHere\u2019s my best advice in less than five minutes:\n\nStick to a simple onboarding process.\n\nEstablish a recruitment process and stick to it.\n\nGet as specific and clear as you can about your expectations.\n\nWhen in doubt, over communicate with your contractors.\n\nTalk through miscommunications on the phone if you can.\n\nAvoid micromanagement. You hired them for a reason \u2014 let them do their job.\n\nBe prepared to check their work thoroughly until you trust them.\n\nEstablish long-term working relationships when you can.\n\nKeep an ongoing list of freelancers you\u2019re comfortable hiring again.\n\nRegularly filter out those you were less than satisfied with.\n\nYou get what you pay for.\n\nWorking with freelancers can be highly effective, especially if you manage them well. Staying organized, keeping track of work, and paying them on time is key to mutually beneficial partnerships you can rely on for years to come."

            "article_content": "F-Secure Total MSRP $69.99 Score Details \u201cF-Secure Total offers solid antivirus protection for all your devices with flexible subscription plans.\u201d Pros Near-perfect protection for years\n\nAffordable multidevice plans\n\nSubscriptions can be customized\n\nQuick and helpful support Cons High false-positive rates\n\nFree malware scanner lacks real-time protection\n\nTable of Contents Table of Contents Tiers and pricing Design Features Support Privacy and security Is F-Secure right for you?\n\nWith the ongoing and increasing threats to cybersecurity, you need a good antivirus solution that doesn\u2019t break the bank. I reviewed F-Secure Total, an affordable antivirus solution that let me build a plan that covers all my devices with just the features I need.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile we all like to keep an eye on the budget, computer security isn\u2019t the right place to cut corners. The best antivirus software provides excellent protection against online and offline malware at an affordable price.\n\nF-Secure has flexible pricing that you can customize to precisely match your needs. The most affordable plan starts at $50 annually, covering one device with real-time antivirus, scam, and ransomware protection in the browser and offline.\n\nYou probably use a computer, phone, and possibly several other devices. If one gets hacked, all of your social and financial accounts are at risk, as is the personal data stored on that device.\n\nIt makes sense to protect them all and F-Secure plans can cover 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, or more devices. A three-device plan starts at $65, five devices cost $70, and 10 computers, phones, and tablets is $85.\n\nThe options don\u2019t stop there. You can add a VPN with unlimited data for $10 more per year. A password manager and identity monitoring also adds $10 annually. With F-Secure, you pay only for what you need.\n\nStill, you can find better deals on antivirus software, at least for the first year of service. I do like that F-Secure doesn\u2019t have shocking price increases when it\u2019s time to renew.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a free solution, F-Secure has a free malware scan and removal tool. The website describes it as an online scanner, but it\u2019s actually a Windows app that installs on your PC before running.\n\nThe free scanner detects and clears malicious apps that are already active on your computer, but doesn\u2019t protect you from future threats. The best free antivirus software offers good browser protection without requiring a subscription.\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nF-Secure Total Platforms Windows, macOS, iOS, Android Devices Customizable (1-26) Support 24/7 Live Chat Free version? Windows malware scan and removal\n\nDesign\n\nI tested F-Secure Total, the version that includes antivirus, a VPN, identity monitoring, and more. After installing the app, the dashboard showed that real-time protection was active, but there were several other features to set up to maximize my cybersecurity.\n\nI installed the browser extension for online protection, the password manager extension to help secure account logins, and a VPN to prevent activity tracking, then added my email address for monitoring.\n\nWith setup complete, I explored the user interface. The dashboard shows all the active features at a glance and lets me select one to make adjustments. A button at the top left opens a menu with more options, including account details, settings, support, and quick access to all the features.\n\nI opened settings and found there are plenty of options to fine-tune each security feature, such as choosing which folders are locked to protect against ransomware.\n\nOverall, F-Secure Total was easy to get started with and the design is clear and simple, with advanced features accessible via settings.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe number one job of an antivirus is to protect my computer from malware. It should offer real-time detection and blocking to prevent infection. As a second line of defense, it should regularly scan for malicious apps and quarantine them so no harm is done.\n\nTo test how well F-Secure Total performed, I checked its score at full-time cybersecurity labs that continuously monitor the threat landscape and rate the effectiveness of leading antivirus software. F-Secure shows excellent AV-Test scores, falling below perfect only once with a minor miss in June 2023.\n\nF-Secure didn\u2019t fare well in AV-Comparatives scoring system, but a deeper dive into the real-time report reveals it blocked as many threats as antivirus leaders Norton, Avira, and McAfee, which have good protection track records.\n\nF-Secure\u2019s score dropped because it had a high false-positive rate, which includes incorrect app and website blocking. An overprotective antivirus can be annoying, but it isn\u2019t dangerous. In my tests, I didn\u2019t get any false alerts.\n\nI always do spot-checks by visiting Wicar\u2019s malware test website. F-Secure Total\u2019s browser extension successfully identified and blocked all 13 malware downloads and browser exploits.\n\nI tested the password manager and it autofilled logins as expected. It\u2019s not as sophisticated as the best password managers that allow organization and password sharing, but it handles the basics well and syncs across devices.\n\nF-Secure Total\u2019s VPN defaults to OpenVPN protocol, which isn\u2019t the fastest. I tried the only other option, IKEv2, which helped. Still, the best speed I measured was 20% as fast as my usual 900 Mbps. With the best dedicated VPN services, I enjoy over 700 Mbps downloads.\n\nSupport\n\nF-Secure claims it offers 24/7 support via live chat, so I tested that out by asking about login sharing. A live agent answered immediately and continued to respond quickly as I clarified my question.\n\nI\u2019ve reviewed several antivirus services and found that live chat support varies. Solutions like ESET have good support, but during limited hours. Others use chat services that start off quickly, then slow dramatically after the first response. I also verified that live chat with a human is available for F-Secure customers all day, every day.\n\nAs I mentioned above, there\u2019s no password sharing option in F-Secure, but the agent suggested I could copy and send the password via a message, email, or written on paper. I liked the inclusion of an offline solution from tech support.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nF-Secure\u2019s privacy policy is very clear and states that it won\u2019t sell or share your personal data to third-party advertisers. It will comply with legal requests, but it doesn\u2019t allow backdoors in its software. The company is based in Finland, which isn\u2019t part of any intelligence alliances for information sharing.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any record of customer data breaches or cybersecurity incidents, so your personal and financial information should be secure when using F-Secure Total antivirus protection.\n\nIs F-Secure right for you?\n\nThe least inexpensive option, F-Secure Internet Security, offers good protection, but doesn\u2019t beat the best antivirus software. While the VPN and password manager are nice additions to F-Secure Total, dedicated services offer more advanced features.\n\nThe best password managers aren\u2019t that expensive, and you can even find excellent free password managers. The same is true of VPNs. Proton offers a great free VPN], and you can often find VPN deals that minimize your cost without sacrificing speed.\n\nWhile F-Secure Total\u2019s high false positive score is a drawback, I didn\u2019t have any problems with apps or websites being blocked. Also, a false positive is better than allowing malware to run wild on your computer.\n\nThat said, antivirus software like Bitdefender and Norton provide solid protection without the annoyance of overzealous blocking. However, I liked F-Secure Total\u2019s customizable subscription plans and consistent pricing on renewal and still recommend it as a good solution if you want to fine-tune your subscription to exactly what you need."

The split widened in 2022 \u2014 47.7% to 52.3% \u2014 with the large equity market correction from which institutional client channels, which tend to have more fixed income allocations, were insulated.\n\nLast year, the trend of retail channels growing faster than institutional channels resumed, with the former\u2019s market share standing at 48.2% and the latter\u2019s at 51.8%.\n\nHigher equity allocations are one reason that retail client assets are generally growing faster than institutional client assets, but other factors are also at play. For example, as corporate defined benefit plans freeze and terminate, Cerulli projects that the channel will have a five-year compound annual growth rate of just 1.2%.\n\nAccording to the research, retail direct investor platforms control the largest portion of exchange-traded funds and mutual funds across all channels, although the channel lost some of its mutual fund asset market share in 2023.\n\nCerulli opined that the financial advisor\u2019s role must keep changing in order to prioritize offerings beyond just investment management."

He cites challenges such as low economic growth, the electricity crisis, failing logistics, and collapsing infrastructure.\n\nThe EFF leader argues that weak policies over the past 15 years have led to stagnant growth, high unemployment\u2014particularly among women and youth\u2014and a decline in public investment, resulting in the breakdown of critical services and the economy.\n\n\u201cIn the past 15 years, we have witnessed a 24% decline in public investment by the central government and public corporations. This decline in public investment has directly contributed to the collapse of the country\u2019s infrastructure, critical services and economy. It is the decline that has led to the collapse of electricity generation capacity, the collapse of logistics and transport networks, the collapse of water infrastructure, the collapse of telecommunications services.\u201d\n\nThe EFF says while it\u2019s happy with the current management at Eskom turning the institution around, it remains concerned about the energy policy direction of the country.\n\n\u201cWe call on a commission of inquiry into the load shedding that our people were subjected to for more than a decade while people were stealing money by burning oil and benefitting from IPPs. We need to know who the culprits were behind the economic sabotage,\u201d Malema adds.\n\nThe EFF says the country experienced economic sabotage when there was an attempt to close down power stations under the notion that their lifespan was ending.\n\nEFF Elective Conference \u2013 EFF calls for inquiry into load shedding:"

This doesn\u2019t mean you were scammed or bought low-quality hardware \u2013 performance can vary widely depending on usage and environment. This guide explains why the gaps exist, and how to find your PC components\u2019 true performance.\n\nSSD Speed and Endurance\n\nSSDs, whether they are regular SATA SSDs or NVMe, are advertised with a maximum read/write speed and an endurance estimate. For example, a mid-range NVMe SSD could be advertised with 7000 MB/s read/write speeds with 600 TBW (Terabytes Written). However, in practical use, you may only see 3500-5000 MB/s speeds on average, with shorter life as well.\n\nThe manufacturer claims are usually based on ideal conditions, like powerful hardware with no bottlenecks and thermal issues. The data used for the test is also large sequential data blocks, which is easier for the SSD to transfer with minimum latency.\n\nIn real-world usage, you have to process both sequential and random data of different sizes. The SSD will have higher latency, as it has to process different types of data from different memory cells. Furthermore, the associated software, CPU power, PCIe lanes, and motherboard model can also create bottlenecks.\n\nAs for SSD life, even though 600 TBW is calculated under ideal conditions and practical use may yield less, it doesn\u2019t matter for regular users. Most won\u2019t reach 600 TBW, and SSDs typically start facing other issues before reaching 600 or even 300 TBW.\n\nHow to find true SSD speed\n\nYou can use a third-party SSD testing tool to learn how your SSD performs on different sets of data. We recommend the CrystalDiskMark program, which is a free Windows app that offers multiple sets of data to test.\n\nAlthough you can change the test parameters for accuracy, the default parameters are fine for most users. Simply click on the All button, and let all four tests run. Check the results in the RND4K Q1T1 section, as it will be closest to day-to-day tasks, while SEQ1M Q8T1 will be closest to manufacturer claims.\n\nUnfortunately, you can\u2019t test the actual estimate for SSD TBW endurance. However, you can use a hard drive health-checking tool, like CrystalDiskInfo, to view current SSD health and overall read/write cycles to estimate how much has been used.\n\nLaptop Battery Timing\n\nLaptop manufacturers advertise laptops with battery time in hours, like 10h or 16h battery life. In reality, the battery lasts much less than that \u2013 almost half of the claimed time, or even less.\n\nWhen testing, manufacturers typically play a 1080p local video on repeat, with the laptop power-saving features enabled, low screen brightness, and communication features disabled, like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\n\nHowever, in real-world cases, you\u2019ll probably have all communications enabled, the laptop on balanced power mode, the screen at least above 50% brightness, and running heavier tasks. This greatly decreases the expected battery time \u2013 which could be worse if you are gaming or running a resource-intensive program.\n\nThere could also be heating issues, due to the environment causing laptop fans to work harder to keep the laptop cool.\n\nHow to find true laptop battery timing\n\nThe easiest way to find the true battery timing of a laptop is to look at online reviews. Most laptops have well-covered reviews from popular review websites that almost always test the battery under real-world usage. Just search for the laptop\u2019s model number, with keywords like \u201cbattery test\u201d or \u201cbattery performance\u201d to find reviews.\n\nHowever, if you want to test it yourself based on your usage, use a battery-tracking app. While great for checking battery estimates, BatteryMon can also help you track complete usage to see how long the battery lasts.\n\nCharge the battery to 100%, unplug the charger, and click on Start graphing in BatteryMon. It will have two lines on the graph, that show the current drop in battery and the estimated drop. Use the laptop as you intend to, and keep the app running until the laptop hibernates due to low battery. Plug it in, and check the graph in BatteryMon that shows how much time it took to reach a low battery level.\n\nMouse Total Clicks\n\nMouse durability is advertised using an average number of clicks that it can sustain, such as 50 million clicks. However, this test is done in a special environment, where the primary click is tested using an actuation machine. The environment is dust- and vibration-free, with the machine putting precise force at fixed intervals. In most cases, only the switch is tested and not the whole mouse.\n\nIn practical use, you\u2019ll probably be using a mouse click with different forces applied from different directions, and you may even drop it. Dirt and handling will also increase wear and tear. Overall, it will give a much lower expected click life than the claims.\n\nTheoretically, if a person clicks 5000 times per day (medium use), then a 50-million clicks mouse should survive 27 years of clicking. Most users report double-clicking issues or other problems with mice within three to five years, so 27 years is rather impossible.\n\nHow to find true mouse click endurance\n\nCurrently, no tool exists to accurately predict the lifespan of a mouse\u2019s click switches. However, users usually talk about their experience with a mouse and how long it lasted on Reddit and other forums. Search for the mouse\u2019s model, with keywords like, \u201cclick life issue\u201d or \u201cmalfunctioning.\u201d\n\nOf course, they won\u2019t be able to tell how many clicks it took to face issues, but they can give an estimate in months/years.\n\nPower Supply Wattage\n\nPower Supply Units (PSU) have a wattage value along with a supply rating, like 600W 80+ Gold PSU. Although PSUs deliver the advertised wattage, this doesn\u2019t mean you can buy a PSU with the same wattage as your system\u2019s power draw. The PC components may draw more power than expected under heavy load. Additionally, the PSU may deliver less power if the temperature is higher.\n\nIn practical use, this creates a gap between PSU power and the system\u2019s power draw limit \u2013 preventing you from using the same PSU wattage as the system\u2019s power needs. This is why it\u2019s recommended to buy at least 20% to 30% higher wattage PSU compared to the system\u2019s rated power draw. It will ensure PSU can handle unexpected load spikes, power inefficiency, upgrades, and overclocking.\n\nHow to test power supply\n\nIf you are concerned about your system power draw and PSU efficiency, use the OCCT app to test it. OCCT is a stress-testing app that can stress your PSU by forcing the CPU, GPU, storage drive, and RAM to work at maximum power.\n\nIn the app, go to Stability Test -> Power, enable both GPUs (if available), and click on Start at the bottom. Let the test run for at least 30 to 60 minutes to ensure no issues occur. If the system crashes/freezes, or OCCT gives an error, it could mean PSU wattage isn\u2019t enough.\n\nCPU Clock Speed\n\nCPUs have a base and a turbo boost clock speed, like a 3.0 GHz base clock speed with a 4.4 GHz turbo boost clock speed. You can set the PC to maximum performance to make the CPU run at the maximum speed claimed by the manufacturer, but your programs won\u2019t normally utilize all that power.\n\nIn reality, CPUs dynamically adjust their clock speed according to workload, which is why you see lower clock speeds than what the manufacturer claims. Even if you do run a program that can utilize such high speeds, other components can bottleneck the CPU.\n\nThe clock speed utilization depends on the programs you are running, not how fast your CPU can run. Additionally, the clock speed may not reach the maximum limits if the CPU temperature is too high.\n\nHow to check the current clock speed utilization\n\nIf you want to know how a program uses the CPU\u2019s power, you can easily check it in the Task Manager. Press the Ctrl + Shift + Esc keys to open the Task Manager, and move to the Performance tab.\n\nYou\u2019ll find the current clock speed in the CPU section, along with a percentage showing how much of that clock speed is being utilized. For example, if the clock speed reads 3.0 GHz with 20% utilization, not only is the system running at a lower clock speed, but only 20% of it is in active use.\n\nBy understanding these differences between real-world results and the manufacturer claims of common PC components, you can make more informed decisions when optimizing the PC or buying a PC.\n\nImage credit: Vecteezy.

            "article_content": "Google unveils Gemini 2.0 and next-gen TPU Trillium, ushering in the era of AI agents\n\nGoogle has officially launched its upgraded AI model, Gemini 2.0, delivering enhanced performance and multimodal capabilities while paving the way for the future era of AI agents. Additionally, Google's sixth-generation Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) Trillium, first introduced at the I/O Developer Conference in May, is now operational to support Gemini 2.0's training and inference workloads.\n\nAI agents: Redefining productivity and automation\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the company's shift toward developing agentic AI models. These models are designed to understand the surrounding environment, plan tasks across multiple steps, and take action under user supervision.\n\nAccording to reports from TechCrunch and VentureBeat, Google has unveiled three AI agent prototypes built on the Gemini 2.0 architecture: Project Astra, Project Mariner, and Jules, each tailored for distinct applications ranging from daily tasks to complex programming and web navigation.\n\nThe general-purpose Project Astra can support multilingual conversations, access and integrate data from Google apps and tools like Google Search and Maps, and even retain previous interaction records for seamless continuity.\n\nProject Astra: General-purpose AI for seamless conversations\n\nProject Astra can support multilingual conversations, access and integrate data from Google apps and tools like Search and Maps, and retain conversation history for seamless continuity. For example, users can share a screenshot of a reading list, activate the camera, and let Astra \"see\" nearby books to recommend the most suitable one as a gift.\n\nCredit: Screenshot from Google\n\nProject Mariner: Web navigation reinvented\n\nProject Mariner, designed for developers and enterprise users, is a Chrome extension powered by Gemini 2.0, enabling automated web navigation. By capturing screenshots and processing them in the cloud, the AI agent can interpret and execute tasks, such as online shopping based on a list.\n\nJaclyn Konzelmann, Director of Product Management at Google Labs, demonstrated how users can prompt Mariner to locate products, add them to carts, and complete purchases. While Mariner achieved an 83.5% task success rate on WebVoyager benchmarks, it still operates with a slight latency of about 5 seconds between mouse movements.\n\nKonzelmann emphasized that AI-driven web navigation represents a paradigm shift in user experience, potentially reducing the need to visit websites directly\u2014a development that may significantly impact online publishers and retailers.\n\nCredit: Screenshot from Google\n\nJules: A coding companion for developers\n\nJules is designed to assist developers by analyzing codebases, suggesting repair plans, and executing fixes across multiple files. It also integrates directly with platforms like GitHub, resembling Microsoft's GitHub Copilot.\n\nCurrently, Jules is available only to a select group of trusted testers, with broader access anticipated in early 2025.\n\nTrillium: The engine behind Gemini 2.0\n\nTrillium, a key player behind the scenes, has been instrumental in powering the training and inference of Gemini 2.0, as noted by CEO Pichai. The Trillium chip, compared to its predecessor, delivers a 4.7x performance boost, doubled HBM capacity and bandwidth, and a 67% energy efficiency improvement.\n\nGoogle has deployed over 100,000 Trillium chips within a single system, supported by its Jupiter network architecture. This configuration achieves a remarkable 13 petabytes per second of data transfer, facilitating the simultaneous utilization of hundreds of thousands of accelerators for a single training task.\n\nMark Lohmeyer, VP of Compute and AI Infrastructure at Google Cloud, highlighted that testing Llama 2 70B with Trillium showed a clear correlation between performance gains and the number of chips used."

            "article_content": "The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and software development has evolved significantly over the past few years, and one of the most exciting developments is the growing use of AI in code reviews.\n\nIn fact, 48% of businesses have found AI to be useful, and it\u2019s mostly for one purpose in particular\u2014code reviews. AI-driven code review tools are increasingly being adopted by developers looking to boost their productivity without sacrificing code quality and \u2018tidiness.\u2019\n\nThrough the automation of repetitive tasks and changing traditional roles, AI-driven tools are fundamentally changing the traditional software development workflow\u2014shifting the focus from mundane code inspections to creative problem-solving. How does it go, though? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nThe Role of AI in Code Review\n\nTraditional code reviews are time-consuming and often inconsistent, as they are heavily reliant on individual expertise and team dynamics. Developers spend hours reviewing code for errors, performance issues, or adherence to coding standards\u2014tasks that are inherently repetitive and prone to human oversight.\n\nThis is where artificial intelligence steps in. With the help of AI models capable of analyzing code in real time, teams can automate these time-consuming checks, enabling developers to focus on larger architectural concerns or improving feature functionality.\n\nAI-driven code review tools work by learning from large datasets of existing codebases. They use techniques such as deep learning and natural language processing to understand coding patterns and identify bugs or inefficiencies.\n\nGitHub\u2019s Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and other similar tools are perfect examples of how AI is stepping into the review cycle, offering suggestions, error corrections, and even rewriting chunks of code. According to one paper, 40% of developers consider Copilot efficient for code reviews and debugging, but poor at instant optimization.\n\nHence, the goal is not to replace developers, but to assist them in doing their work more efficiently, ensuring high code quality without investing disproportionate amounts of time in reviewing.\n\nAddressing Code Quality at Scale\n\nOne of the main challenges for engineering teams is maintaining high code quality as projects grow in scale. Large-scale codebases tend to suffer from inconsistencies due to multiple contributors, differing skill levels, and divergent programming styles.\n\nFor this purpose, AI-driven code reviews help standardize code quality by providing a consistent set of rules and standards that are applied uniformly, regardless of the reviewer\u2019s experience. Anything that doesn\u2019t abide by the predefined rules will get flagged.\n\nTools like DeepCode or SonarQube utilize machine learning models that improve over time, identifying code smells, vulnerabilities, and antipatterns that might be missed in manual reviews.\n\nMoreover, they help enforce best practices for code style, architecture, and performance, which becomes critical for long-term maintainability. In practical terms, they can automatically spot deprecated API usages, security flaws, or suboptimal memory utilization, enhancing both the efficiency of code reviews and the reliability of the code itself.\n\nBoosting Developer Productivity\n\nAI-driven code review tools not only improve code quality, but also save developers significant time. According to one study, devs determined that Copilot allowed them to complete tasks 26% faster than without the aid of AI.\n\nIn particular, repetitive, low-value tasks\u2014like identifying missing semicolons or checking compliance with naming conventions\u2014are ideal for offloading to an AI. This doesn\u2019t just free up developers from manual, error-prone checks; it creates opportunities for more meaningful contributions, such as working on new features or refactoring complex components.\n\nFurthermore, using AI enables a faster feedback loop, especially in teams where reviews are bottlenecked by the availability of senior developers. Instead of drowning in a backlog of pull requests, these developers can dedicate more of their time to the more nuanced aspects of the code\u2014like examining architectural decisions or scalability implications.\n\nIntegrating AI Without Losing Human Insight\n\nAI-driven tools excel at identifying syntactic errors, catching common vulnerabilities, and enforcing style consistency.\n\nHowever, there are deeper insights\u2014such as understanding the intent behind a piece of code or assessing how a change might impact the entire ecosystem\u2014where human expertise is irreplaceable. Developers must therefore find a balance between adopting AI-driving code reviews and maintaining the human element essential to code craftsmanship.\n\nEffective use of AI in code reviews requires human oversight to evaluate the broader impact of suggestions made by AI. For example, while an AI might identify a method as being too long or inefficient, a developer must still assess whether breaking that method into smaller parts aligns with the overall project architecture.\n\nSimilarly, an AI shouldn\u2019t be able to convert documents with Node.js autonomously, without approval and human oversight. It\u2019s all about finding the balance, while not endangering the process as a whole.\n\nAdditionally, AI-driven tools are only as effective as the training data they have received. This means they can sometimes fall prey to biases or incorrect patterns if the training data contains suboptimal practices. It\u2019s crucial for development teams to continuously update and fine-tune these tools, ensuring they reflect current best practices.\n\nPractical Benefits Beyond Productivity\n\nAI in code reviews is not just about speeding up mundane processes; it offers concrete financial benefits as well. Take, for example, AWS costs; poorly optimized code can contribute to unnecessarily high cloud costs, with suboptimal algorithms running longer or using more resources than needed.\n\nAI-driven reviews can assist in identifying inefficiencies that, if corrected, might result in significant reductions in cloud expenditure\u2014something any engineering manager paying AWS bills will appreciate, even if mentioned subtly.\n\nMoreover, AI tools are invaluable when it comes to knowledge sharing across teams. Junior developers often struggle with the vast number of coding standards, best practices, and nuances of a given codebase.\n\nAI suggestions, especially in code reviews, can serve as instant guidance, offering suggestions that reflect the coding style and quality that the team expects. A proper rubber duck that talks back, if you will. Moreover, AI also acts as an onboarded mentor, ensuring junior developers grow their skills faster while reducing the burden on senior team members.\n\nThe Future of AI-Driven Code Reviews\n\nAs AI continues to mature, its role in software development workflows will only expand. We can expect more advanced features in AI-driven code review tools.\n\nSome experts, like the ones at Deloitte, anticipate a larger-scale revolution. In particular, they believe developers will spend less time developing and more time orchestrating AI-guided ecosystems.\n\nFuture innovations could include everything from improved natural language capabilities that better understand the context of code changes to predictive models that can anticipate potential bugs based on historical commit data. The future might even include AI systems that understand a project\u2019s long-term goals and recommend code improvements accordingly.\n\nOnce again, the true value of AI-driven code reviews lies in their ability to support developers, not replace them. The role of the developer increasingly will be about leveraging AI to reduce friction, ensure consistency, and maintain focus on high-impact activities.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI-driven code review tools are set to play an increasingly prominent role in software development, empowering developers to focus on creative problem-solving while leaving the repetitive checks to machines.\n\nThese tools address challenges related to consistency, scalability, and knowledge sharing, making code reviews faster and more reliable. What\u2019s more, this \u2018rubber duck\u2019 effect is only going to get more pronounced as time goes on.\n\nIntegrating AI into the development cycle may not be without challenges, but its benefits are undeniable. The key is to treat AI as a collaborator\u2014one that amplifies human abilities and helps development teams build better software, faster.\n\nAlex Williams is a seasoned full-stack developer and the former owner of Hosting Data U.K. After graduating from the University of London with a Masters Degree in IT, Alex worked as a developer, leading various projects for clients from all over the world for almost 10 years.

The publication contributed the article to Space.com's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.\n\nWe have only one example of biology forming in the universe \u2013 life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don\u2019t know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth . Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI\u2019m an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology . Through my research, I\u2019ve learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial, since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there\u2019s advanced alien life out there, I\u2019m on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars , have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2013 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it\u2019s a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don\u2019t agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \u201cself-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\u201d That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nEvolution vs Natural Selection - YouTube Watch On\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet\u2019s atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA\u2019s definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2013 biological or not \u2013 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nMinerals are an example of a nonliving system that has increased in diversity and complexity over billions of years. (Image credit: UNM Newsroom)\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism\u2019s genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life\u2019s essential molecules \u2013 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they\u2019re unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they\u2019ll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth\u2019s crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system , or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that\u2019s for life as we know it \u2013 for life as we don\u2019t know it, all bets are off.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.

Discover SCENE\n\nU.S. Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ), who posted to his X (formerly known as Twitter) account Friday a video he took of swarms of mysterious drones that have been spotted nightly during the past few weeks, said he was increasingly concerned about the unexplained phenomenon.\n\nKim, who joined local police in rural Clinton Township, New Jersey, 36 miles north of Trenton, said he spotted small clusters of two to four drones a number of times throughout the evening.\n\n\u201cWe often saw about 5-7 lights at a time that were low and not associated with aircraft we could see on the tracker app,\u201d Kim said, noting that the group used a flight tracker app to distinguish the drones from airplanes. \u201cSome hovered while others moved across the horizon.\u201d\n\nLast night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here\u2019s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDn \u2014 Andy Kim (@AndyKimNJ) December 13, 2024\n\nKim said police have tried to get close to the drones using helicopters, but when approached, the drones would turn off their lights and go dark, echoing a statement by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis has gone on for weeks,\u201d Kim wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren\u2019t able to track these devices to determine origin, and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and countermeasures.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, eyewitnesses are pushing back against government claims that the drones pose no threat to communities or infrastructure. The growing story has spread to New York, Maryland, and Connecticut, where officials are demanding answers, while new reports of \u201ccar-sized\u201d UFOs were registered in California and parts of Europe.\n\n\u201cWhy is no one talking about the incident that caused an evac helicopter to not be able to pick up a patient due to these drones being in the way of where the helicopter had to go, and made the helicopter turn around and not be able to get the patient?\u201d New Jersey resident Roseann Stanley said on X. \u201cYet they are saying these drones have not caused any problems. That is a huge problem.\u201d\n\nOn November 26, a medical helicopter heading to an accident in Branchburg Township in Somerset County was unable to pick up an injured patient due to drones hovering near the landing zone, according to a report by New Jersey media outlet NJ.com.\n\nHundreds of drones were first spotted in mid-November flying over New Jersey; eyewitnesses have reported seeing convoys of drones almost every night since then and have described the crafts, in some cases, as being as big as the hood of a car, and performing in more sophisticated ways than off-the-shelf, consumer-oriented drones.\n\nThough the mysterious objects have been reported in the vicinity of a number of New Jersey-based military installations, with speculation about their provenance ranging from aliens from outer space to Iranian spycraft, Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Wednesday that no government facilities have been threatened by the drones.\n\nWhite House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said during a press conference on Thursday that \u201cwhile there is no known malicious activity occurring, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight a gap in authorities.\u201d\n\nKirby argued for new legislation that will better \u201cidentify and mitigate any potential threats to airports or other critical infrastructure, and so that state and local authorities are provided all the tools that they need to respond to such threats as well.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, many people believe the whole thing is much ado about nothing, and probably a stunt of some kind.\n\n\u201cI think these are just normal drones,\u201d Joseph Steinberg, a local resident, told Decrypt. \u201cMy daughter saw a large one, I went outside with her and we looked, but it was hard to judge the size.\u201d\n\n\"The first problem in situations like this is that beyond the initial drone sightings, you quickly get an overwhelming number of reports of things that aren\u2019t drones,\" Grant Jordan, the CEO of San Diego-based drone detection software company SkySafe, told Decrypt. \"When I look at these videos, the vast majority\u201499 out of 100\u2014aren't drones. They're aircraft, helicopters, satellites.\"\n\nAs Jordan explained, the flood of recent drone reports in New Jersey reveals two issues. First, people rarely observe the night sky, and mistake normal air traffic\u2014flashing lights, moving objects\u2014for something unusual. Second, judging the size and distance in the sky is difficult.\n\nWhile Jordan did not attribute these ongoing sightings to a growing hysteria, he did caution that copycats are likely at work, trying to capitalize on the public\u2019s fear and interest.\n\n\"When a story like this gets attention, it draws more people in\u2014some flying drones to look for others, and some just flying them to mess with people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are now seeing these drones in San Diego and the videos that were shown, it's just standard air traffic going into the San Diego Airport.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

In July, NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover uncovered a rock on the Red Planet that sports white spots with black rings laced with iron phosphate (see Page 28). On Earth, such specks have been linked to ancient micro\u00adbial life. But they\u2019re not surefire signs of microbes. The only way to know for certain is to bring the rock back to Earth for closer inspection.\n\nNASA\u2019s Perseverance rover discovered leopard spot\u2013like features in this Martian rock (closeup image shown). On Earth, similar structures are associated with microbial life. MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASA\n\nSparking superconductivity\n\nLight may be the secret ingredient for making superconductors that don\u2019t require frigid conditions. In an experiment, blasting a copper and oxygen compound with a laser caused the material to throw off magnetic fields. That magnetism, the scientists say, is a smoking gun for superconductivity \u2014 the ability to ferry electricity with no resistance (SN: 8/10/24, p. 6). But skeptics contend that those magnetic fields might have arisen from some other, unknown physics.\n\nIn experiments, a compound made of copper and oxygen atoms (blue and red spheres in this illustration) blasted with laser light (red) threw off magnetic fields (blue). This effect signals that the compound transformed into a superconductor, some physicists say. Sebastian Fava, J\u00f6rg M. Harms\n\nAncient engineering\n\nBuilders used a water-powered elevator to construct Egypt\u2019s first pyramid nearly 4,700 years ago, researchers propose (SN: 9/7/24 & 9/21/24, p. 11). That controversial idea is based on a computer model of structures in and around the Step Pyramid of Djoser. Controlling the flow of floodwater in and out of a shaft inside the pyramid could have lifted and lowered a block-hoisting platform, the model shows. But critics argue that occasional rains wouldn\u2019t have supplied enough water to sustain such a system.\n\nAncient workers could have built Egyptian King Djoser\u2019s pyramid (shown) using a water-powered elevator to hoist the heavy stone blocks, a computer simulation suggests. But not all archaeologists are on board with the idea. Anton Petrus/Moment/Getty Images\n\nTectonic shake-up\n\nPlate tectonics got off to an early start in Earth\u2019s history, a rock in South Africa suggests. Layers in the rock bear scars of 3-billion-year-old landslides that may have been caused by an earthquake (SN: 4/6/24, p. 6). That quake, scientists say, could have been triggered by slabs of crust colliding. The finding lends support to the contested idea that plate tectonics dates back more than 2.8 billion years. But other geologists are not convinced that this quake marks the start of global plate tectonics.\n\nLayers of rock at the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa contain hints of a huge earthquake triggered by plate tectonics more than 3 billion years ago. Simon Lamb\n\nMedium size, maximum hype\n\nFor the first time, astronomers may have spotted a midsize black hole in our galaxy (SN: 8/10/24, p. 7). Telescope data suggest that a black hole at least 8,200 times as massive as the sun lurks in the star cluster Omega Centauri. But another study disputes the claim. Instead, the star cluster could harbor a horde of smaller black holes (SN: 8/20/24).\n\nIf a rare midsize black hole truly does lurk in the heart of the Omega Centauri star cluster, it would be the first black hole of its size found in the Milky Way. In this Hubble Space Telescope image, the supposed black hole\u2019s location is marked by the white box. Hubble/ESA, NASA, M. H\u00e4berle/MPIA\n\nTransmissible Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is not contagious in everyday life, but under extremely rare conditions, it may spread from one person to another (SN: 2/24/24, p. 6). Five people who in childhood received contaminated growth hormone injections later developed early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 most likely because the hormones were tainted with amyloid-beta, a protein whose buildup is linked to the disease, researchers say. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether the growth hormones are to blame, other experts note. Perhaps the health conditions that those hormones were meant to treat or other medical procedures led to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s in these patients.\n\nHigh levels of the protein amyloid-beta \u2014 a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 appear orange and purple in this brain scan of a man with the disease. Childhood exposure to the protein via contaminated growth hormone injections may have led the man to develop Alzheimer\u2019s later in life. G. Banerjee et al/Nature Medicine 2024\n\nShedding light on dark energy\n\nDark energy may have gotten even more mysterious. The enigmatic stuff, which makes up the bulk of the cosmos, is generally thought to maintain a constant density. But new observations of 6.4 million galaxies and quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, or DESI, paired with data on exploding stars, cast doubt on that idea. These data more closely fit a model of the universe in which the relationship between dark energy\u2019s density and its pressure changes over time (SN: 5/4/24 & 5/18/24, p. 6). If confirmed, this finding would rewrite the history of the universe. Experts are withholding judgment until DESI completes its survey of over 30 million other galaxies (SN: 12/14/24 & 12/28/24, p. 7)."

This is a reality for a young Chicago student who recently found a bacterium that exhibits antibiotic activity and produces a novel compound that slows the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells in the lab. Where did this startling discovery come from? Well, goose poop of course.\n\nThis budding young middle school scientist was part of a community partnership with a local university that engages kids from underrepresented and low-income backgrounds. The team partnered with Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, which allowed them to engage with middle schoolers as part of a 14-week applied science program.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nInequality in educational resources, especially for STEM subjects, has often prevented some students from accessing these fields when they\u2019re older. However, a team from the University of Illinois at Chicago, led by Brian Murphy, has established a partnership that engages such groups at an early stage in their educational development. The hope is that, by providing them with a chance to conduct real, high-quality research, these young students will come to see themselves as scientists and explore related careers in the future.\n\nAs Murphy\u2019s lab is focused on finding antibiotics from natural sources, the students helped scour their local communities for environmental samples. Before someone suggests this was just a way to outsource sample gathering, the students then followed up on the stages of scientific processing, especially for programming a specialized robot that removes bacterial colonies from growth plates and tests them for antibiotic activity.\n\n\u201cAll experiments are performed under the guidance of graduate student or postdoctoral scientist volunteer mentors\u201d, the researchers explain in their study.\n\n\u201cEach student collected 3 samples of their choice from Garfield Park in Chicago, IL. Students pretreated and diluted their samples before plating each one on three different media types [....] While their bacteria incubated, they practiced block programming on LEGO EV3 modules in preparation for robot operation. When their environmental diversity plates exhibited sufficient bacterial growth, students programmed and operated the Hudson Robotics RapidPickMP to pick all distinguishable colonies from their environmental diversity plates and transfer them onto dual-sided agar plate assay (DAPA) bioassay plates.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDuring their search, one student returned with a sample of goose poop that contained a strain of bacteria called Pseudomonas idahonensis \u2013 a species that had previously been isolated from rainbow trout in Idaho (idahonensis means \u201cfrom Idaho). The student, Camarria Williams, and Jonathon Rodriguez, Technology Program Manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, are listed as co-authors of the paper\n\nIt was concluded that this bacterium had antibiotic activity and even produced a completely new-to-science compound. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry, the university researchers were able to determine that orfamide N was not actually responsible for the antibiotic activity observed before. However, the compound did hinder the growth of human melanoma and ovarian cancer cells when it was tested in the laboratory.\n\nIt is believed that further testing could reveal additional advantageous properties of this new molecule.\n\nThis project demonstrates that it is possible to combine educational outreach with natural product discovery research while also showing how important it is to develop strong relationships between universities and local communities. In particular, it offers typically under-represented students a chance to be scientists themselves and to make incredible discoveries like this!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nGuess we should also thank the goose for providing its poop as well.\n\nThe study is published in the journal ACS Omega."

            "article_content": "EMBL's scientists have been instrumental in helping the world understand, decode, archive, and manipulate genomes at scale and across many branches of the evolutionary tree\n\nBy Ewan Birney, Eileen Furlong, and Arnaud Krebs\n\nIn 1978, British biochemist Frederick Sanger's team released the genome sequence of \u03d5X174 - a virus that infects bacteria. The sequence - the five thousand or so nucleotide 'letters' that make up the instruction manual that is this virus's genome - represented a remarkable feat, especially since DNA sequencing was still a young technique at the time. The development of DNA sequencing methods would bring Sanger his second Nobel Prize in Chemistry two years later.\n\nSince then, the field of genomics has grown by leaps and bounds, and throughout this exponential revolution, EMBL has played a pivotal role, one which it continues to expand on today.\n\nOn sequences and sequencers\n\nOne of the pioneers of the field, Wilhelm Ansorge, joined EMBL in 1979 as a group leader and later became Head of the Functional Genomics Technology Unit. His group developed several methods for increasing the speed and accuracy of DNA sequencing, as well as the first automated fluorescence DNA sequencing system for large genomics DNA. Some of these methods were used later for the Human Genome Project - the large-scale international project which released the first sequence of the human genome in 2003. Ansorge's team also participated in sequencing the genomes of yeast, mouse, mosquito, and a plant called Arabidopsis, often used as a model organism by biologists.\n\nCumulative and rapid advances in methods for DNA sequencing resulted in the arrival of next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods in the late 1990s and 2000s, which relied on carrying out huge numbers of sequencing reactions in parallel and then putting the sequences together by aligning them where they overlapped. Companies such as Roche, Solexa, and Illumina entered the field with commercial sequencing machines which could analyse and sequence genomes with ever-growing speed and accuracy, at larger scales and lower costs than older technologies.\n\nEMBL was one of the first European research institutes to take advantage of this rapid technological progress. By 2001, it had set up the genomics core facility, GeneCore - then a Sanger sequencing and microarray provider, led by biochemist Vladimir Benes, who still heads the facility today. GeneCore was one of the first facilities in Europe to embrace the new sequencing methods, adapting and making them available to researchers across Europe as a service. Today, it is an advanced next-generation sequencing platform, providing end-to-end support to users from across its member states, as well as globally, in their genomics projects.\n\nA parallel revolution in data\n\nThe growing number of DNA sequences also created a demand for computational support to deal with the resulting data deluge. In 1980, EMBL founded the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library, the first central depository of nucleotide sequence data in the world. Under Graham Cameron's leadership, this later developed into the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), established in 1994 and located on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, UK.\n\nSince then EMBL-EBI has developed and made available systematic annotations of genomes with flagship projects such as ENSEMBL, providing a roadmap for scientists to probe genome functions. This initiative - which allowed scientists to view and annotate genomes, identifying the location of genes and non-coding regions - was born in 1999, and then headed by Ewan Birney, currently the Deputy Director General of EMBL and Director of EMBL-EBI. Moreover, EMBL-EBI was a pioneer in the development of repositories for scientists to deposit their data, ArrayExpress for microarray data being an early example. These initiatives transformed the way we do science, as they promoted the reuse of datasets in different contexts, improving reproducibility and speeding up discovery. More EMBL achievements in the fields of bioinformatics and computational biology are discussed here.\n\nUnderstanding the biology of the genome\n\nGenome sequences, databases, and annotations provide scientists with a roadmap to decipher how the genome functions. Microarrays and next generation sequencing enabled the measurement of molecules, and their regulation, at a scale that wasn't possible before. It allows scientists to ask fundamental questions such as, how does the cell maintain, replicate, and decode its genome in order to perform its many functions and adapt rapidly to changes? EMBL's Genome Biology Unit tries to answer these questions. Headed by Senior Scientist Eileen Furlong since 2009, the Unit uses various systems-level approaches to unravel the complex processes involved in regulating the cell's information flow from DNA, RNA, to proteins, integrating cutting-edge experimental and computational approaches and working across scales.\n\nOne of the central challenges of genome biology is to understand which parts of the genome are transcribed into mRNA with various cellular functions. Ansorge's pioneering work allowed researchers for the first time to detect mRNA transcripts using a microarray chip - a small device that can help scientists simultaneously measure the expression levels of all genes in a sample. This groundbreaking technology later allowed the group of Lars Steinmetz to show that large parts of eukaryotic genomes, even outside of genes, are transcribed into RNA. Following this, Steve Cohen's group was one of the first to identify a function for a particular type of non-genic transcripts - microRNAs - in regulating the expression of other genes.\n\nExpression of a gene is controlled by the interplay of multiple molecular mechanisms, many of which were identified at EMBL. Inside cells, DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones in a structure called chromatin. The shape and structure of chromatin help regulate how easily key proteins called transcriptional activators can access their target genes, which, in turn, regulates gene expression. EMBL researchers made several key contributions in identifying and understanding the mode of action of molecular machines that regulate chromatin structure. For instance, Asifa Akhtar and Peter Becker were the first to discover and characterise a chromatin modifier that controls differences in gene expression between male and female fruit flies.\n\nJurg M\u00fcller's Group discovered the enzymatic function of PCR1, one of the key regulators of the genes that control organismal development. These include the Hox-gene cluster, whose role in regulating fruit fly development was discovered at EMBL by Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus, and which was later shown to also be central for mammalian development by EMBL alumnus Denis Duboule.\n\nEMBL researchers have also pioneered the study of 'cis-regulatory elements' - the DNA switches that turn genes on and off. This has been the focus of Eileen Furlong's lab for the last two decades, producing a breadth of studies ranging from developing the methods to map the binding of transcription factors across the genome, to predicting their activity and uncovering the first map of the cis-regulatory elements at the level of an entire organism by pushing the boundaries of single cell genomics.\n\nIn addition, research at EMBL is highly interdisciplinary, and while genome function has been dissected using sequencing techniques, genome regulation processes have also been deciphered from a molecular perspective using structural methods, with multiple research groups providing key insights into the structure-function relationships of enzymes involved in genomic function, such as work from Christoph M\u00fcller's group on RNA polymerase or chromatin remodelling complexes.\n\nEMBL has also led the way in developing, validating, and distributing computational tools to analyse gene expression. For example, the software package DESeq (and its successor DESeq2) created by Wolfgang Huber's team is one of the most widely used packages to identify changes in the expression of genes or their regulators.\n\nFrom the DNA code to human health, biodiversity, and more\n\nThe study of genomes has opened up exciting possibilities for improving human health and helping solve global challenges. One area of progress has been the study of microbiomes - all the microorganisms that inhabit a given environment. Rapid sequencing of DNA in representative environmental samples can give us a snapshot of all the microorganisms living in it, creating a 'metagenome'. This method has been used successfully by EMBL researchers to investigate microbiomes in diverse contexts, e.g. those living in soil or in our guts, and the effect of factors like antibiotics on them. EMBL Heidelberg's Bork Group was one of the pioneers of metagenomics and microbiome sequencing and developed many of the tools that are widely used in this field today. Research by several groups at EMBL (Typas, Patil, Bork) has also shown that our gut microbiome influences how efficiently drugs can act and modulate the risk for certain diseases.\n\nThe Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project also deserves a special mention here. This project involved more than 1300 scientists and clinicians from 37 countries, who analysed more than 2600 genomes of 38 different tumour types, creating a huge resource of primary cancer genomes. This was co-led by Jan Korbel, and the starting point for many working groups across the world to study and provide novel insights regarding the early evolution of cancer, the mutational processes acting in tumours, and the genes active during distinct stages of tumour progression.\n\nGenomic databases and studies are crucial for the progress of genomic medicine - the use of genomics-based technologies such as DNA sequencing to support healthcare. EMBL, particularly EMBL-EBI, contributes strongly in this regard via collaborations with initiatives such as Genomics England and the Nordic EMBL Partnership . EMBL is currently supporting Genomic Medicine initiatives across Europe, including in the UK, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, and Norway. The European Genomic Data Infrastructure (GDI) project brings many of these projects together. EMBL also plays a crucial role in empowering the scientific community by organising a number of meetings, conferences, workshops, and courses around genomics, focusing on both experimental work and data analysis.\n\nAs we head into the next 50 years of genomics, it is interesting to speculate on the future of the field. New strides are already being made in the fields of single-cell omics, where DNA, RNA, and the regulation of RNA transcription can be studied at the level of single cells, and even from intact tissues and organs. These studies provide new insights into a cell's state in any given condition and how that compares to other cell types in the same organ or organism. Such technologies reveal changes during development and disease and are currently being used by EMBL scientists to understand how embryonic development is impacted by genetic and environmental variation, as well as to understand changes during cancer progression. Cancer is caused by multiple changes in DNA, and EMBL scientists currently collaborate with oncologists at Heidelberg University to pinpoint which DNA changes are the most detrimental and to understand how they function.\n\nLarge-scale perturbations of the genome are also giving researchers bigger tools than ever before to understand genome function in precise detail. Moreover, the emergence of methods to synthesise and edit entire genomes, at least for smaller organisms, will revolutionise our ability to understand and modify the functionalities of genomes. The growth of spatial-omics - the integration of imaging with genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics technologies - and the use of AI-based systems for analysing genomic codes and predicting gene locations might soon provide a holistic view on genome function. Finally, we are seeing a revolution in the processing of genomes from environmental samples, such as those collected during the Traversing European Coastlines (TREC) expedition , leading not only to a better understanding of global biodiversity but also a clearer picture of the effect of our changing climate and human endeavours.\n\nLearn more about EMBL's contribution to life science research and services in our 50th anniversary commemorative publication."
