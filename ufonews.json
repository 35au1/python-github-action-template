            "article_content": "Did you know that Jimmy Carter was open about seeing a UFO?\n\nDid you know that Jimmy Carter was open about seeing a UFO?\n\nCHARLOTTE (QUEEN CITY NEWS) \u2014 If you saw a U.F.O., would you tell anyone? What if you were a high-profile politician? Would you admit it, or would you be silenced by the stigma that often accompanies such out-of-this-world tales?\n\nA lawmaker who would eventually become the 39th president of the United States reported his encounter, and the reaction may surprise you.\n\nA lot of people don\u2019t know this, but the late former president Jimmy Carter saw a color-changing U.F.O. in Georgia back in 1969.\n\nHis willingness to discuss it leaves behind a unique legacy of openness about U.F.O. sightings.\n\nAmericans honor former President Jimmy Carter\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarter\u2019s personal encounter happened outside a Lions club in Leary, Georgia. He was with a group of about two dozen witnesses who all saw a bright orb changing colors from blue to red to white. According to history.com., the orb moved toward and away from the crowd, stopped, and then disappeared behind pine trees. Carter said the object was self-illuminated and not solid in nature. It was in view for about 12 minutes before it passed out of sight.\n\nWhen Carter was governor in 1973, he filed an official report with the International U.F.O. Bureau. He spoke freely about the encounter and even promised, during his 1976 presidential campaign, to release all government information if elected.\n\nAccording to reports, he backed away from his pledge, citing security concerns and defense implications.\n\nA member of the Carter family did some research and decided it was likely from the release of a glowing chemical cloud produced by rockets launched from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. Some of these sodium and barium chemical clouds were visible by the scattering of sunlight as far away as Leary, Georgia, appearing around the same time of the sighting. A copy of this report is at the Jimmy Carter Library.\n\nCarter is quoted as saying, \u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure. I\u2019ll never make fun of people who say they\u2019ve seen unidentified objects in the sky.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCarter left a message cast to the cosmos in 1977.\n\nUSA Today reports that in a message sent to space, along with recordings of Earth\u2019s music, languages, and images, Carter left a message on a golden record launched on the space probe, Voyager 1, saying, in part, \u201cWe hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations.\u201d The message continues to travel beyond our solar system today.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

            "article_content": "UFO 50 is one of the most impressive and audacious video game releases in recent memory, precisely because of what it doesn't do. There are no hyperrealistic graphics or massive open worlds. Instead, UFO 50 is a collection of 50 games that pay homage to classic titles from the 1980s. Think of it as the Well-Tempered Clavier of 8-bit gaming.\n\nThe backstory of UFO 50 is that the games are the catalog of a fictional game company from the '80s. There are platformers, shoot-'em-ups, side-scrolling beat-'em-ups, RPGs, puzzle games, turn-based strategies, a point-and-click horror adventure, Metroidvanias, dungeon crawlers, and more. The collection recreates not just the pixel graphics and chunky synth soundtracks\u2014which are delightful\u2014but the experience of dusting off a trove of video game cartridges and exploring them at your leisure.\n\nLike their inspirations, these games don't hold your hand. There are no tutorials, and part of the fun is going into a game blind and figuring out its internal logic. For those who grew up in the 1980s and '90s, it's all a heady dose of nostalgia, but these aren't merely reskinned copies of old titles or minigames. A group of independent developers spent eight years crafting them, and each one is a complete game with an original idea or twist.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shock of UFO 50 is how consistently good all the titles are. The simple controls, tight design, and challenging-but-rewarding gameplay reminds players why video games are fun in the first place. If you've ever had trouble putting down a controller because \"just one more try,\" you will become obsessed with at least one\u2014more likely several\u2014of UFO 50's offerings.\n\nThe post Review: UFO 50 Pays Homage to '80s Video Games appeared first on Reason.com."

            "article_content": "In a discovery that feels like science brought fiction to life, researchers at the University of Toronto claim to have shown that 'negative time' is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible phenomenon. In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

The outage began on December 26th, 2024 at 10:40 AM and was mostly resolved by 3:11 PM, except for except ChatGPT which was 100% recovered by 6:20 PM.\n\nThe following services were impacted:\n\nChatGPT\n\nSora video creation\n\nAPIs: agents, realtime speech, batch, and DALL-E\n\nCause of OpenAI Outage\n\nThe cause of the outage was a cloud provider data center failure which impacted OpenAI databases. While the databases are mirrored across regions, switching over to a backup database required manual interaction on the part of the cloud provider to redirect operations to a backup datacenter in another region. The manual intervention was cited as how the outage was fixed but the given reason for why it took so long was the scale of the project.\n\nA failover is an automated process for switching to a backup system in the event of a system failure. OpenAI announced that they are working toward creating infrastructure changes to improve responses to future cloud database failures.\n\nOpenAI explained:\n\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, we will embark on a major infrastructure initiative to ensure our systems are resilient to an extended outage in any region of any of our cloud providers by adding a layer of indirection under our control in between our applications and our cloud databases. This will allow significantly faster failover.\u201d\n\nSignificant ChatGPT Outage\n\nOpenAI\u2019s said the ChatGPT outage was due to a regional cloud provider database failure but the effect was global, evidenced by user reports on social media from across Europe and North America.\n\nGoogle Trends, which tracks search volume, indicates that this may have been the largest such event, with more people searching for information about it than for any previous outage.\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/lilgrapher"

            "article_content": "If you are still in awe of Generative AI solutions such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Meta AI, and Gemini, you are in for more surprises. OpenAI, for one, is talking about much more powerful and deeper Large Language Models (LLMs) that promise to become an integral part of our daily activities.\n\nImagine a customer wanting to do a banking transaction, say checking their bank balance. He can pose that question to ChatGPT\u2019s advanced model, and if the bank has adopted the solution, it can start a conversation, access the customer\u2019s account by verifying it by sending an OTP to their registered KYC contact numbers, and answer the queries.\n\nThis enhances the customer experience and allows banks to handle a larger volume of queries with fewer resources.\n\nSimilarly, HR departments can sift through a huge number of resumes using the advanced models. By simply posing a few filters (experience, geography, etc.), it can help the HR departments can shortlist candidates in no time. \u201cYou can even schedule interview schedules using the solution,\u201d Atty Eleti, a member of technical staff at OpenAI, has said.\n\nDemonstrating the capabilities of some of the OpenAI\u2019s advanced models at T-Hub here on Friday, he said that the upcoming AI solutions would continue to become smarter, moving beyond simply answering questions to actually performing tasks and solving complex problems. Talking on the \u2018Unlocking OpenAI\u2019s potential for India\u2019, he spoke on some advanced models such as O-Series (\u2018Reasoning\u2019 models) GPT-4 Mini, and Sora. While the reasoning models demonstrate an ability to \u2018think\u2019 before responding, GPT-4 Mini is a more cost-effective version of GPT-4, and Sora helps users create realistic HD videos simply by providing text prompts.\n\nEleti said the future of AI interaction would extend beyond text and voice to encompass a broader range of modalities, including video, physical motion, and even social cues.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming AI models will dynamically generate user interfaces, control robots, and interact with the physical world in more sophisticated ways, blurring the lines between the digital and real,\u201d he said.\n\nAs AI technology advances, it will become more affordable and accessible to a wider population. He said OpenAI was committed to reducing the cost of its models and making them available through various platforms, ensuring that everyone can benefit from the transformative power of AI.\n\nPegging the user base for LLMs at about 0.5-1 billion, he said there a large number of people in the world that are yet to access these services.\n\nIndia plans\n\nHe said India emerged as the second biggest base for the US company in terms of the user base and the number of developers.\n\n\u201cIndia is a key market for its technology, with the country boasting the second-largest user base for its products. Millions of Indians are already using OpenAI\u2019s tools for various purposes, from education and personal productivity to business operations.\n\nHe said the company has significantly invested in improving its models\u2019 support for Indian languages, including Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, and Urdu. This has resulted in an 80 per cent reduction in token counts for these languages, leading to faster processing times and lower costs.\n\nHe said the company was working with Indian businesses to demonstrate the potential of AI and encourage its adoption. He cited the examples of 10Bed ICU, which uses OpenAI\u2019s technology to transcribe doctor-patient conversations and summarise patient files, and HealthifyMe, an AI-powered nutrition tracker that provides personalised health insights.\n\nLater, an OpenAI team met with Telangana government officials to discuss how to leverage AI for effective governance and enhanced citizen service delivery. This session aimed to foster collaboration between OpenAI and government stakeholders and highlight AI\u2019s pivotal role in driving impactful public service solutions.\n\nJayesh Ranjan, Special Chief Secretary, Department of Information Technology, Electronics & Communications (ITE&C, Govt of Telangana), said the government would continue collaborating with OpenAI to promote AI innovation and opportunities.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

            "article_content": "OpenAI unveiled the reasoning-focused o3 series of artificial intelligence (AI) models last month. During a live stream, the company shared the benchmark scores of the model based on internal testing. While all of the shared scores were impressive and highlighted the improved capabilities of the successor to o1, one benchmark score stood out. On the ARC-AGI benchmark, the large language model (LLM) scored 85 percent, beating the previous best score by a 30 percent margin. Interestingly, this score is also on par with what an average human scored on the test.\n\nOpenAI Scores 85 Percent on ARC-AGI Benchmark\n\nHowever, just because o3 scored such a high score on the test, does it mean its intelligence is equal to that of an average human? This would be easier to answer if the AI model was released in the public domain and we could test it out. Since OpenAI has not disclosed anything about the model's architecture, training techniques, or datasets, it is difficult to conclusively claim anything.\n\nThere are certain things that we do know about the AI firm's reasoning-focused models which can help us understand just what to expect from OpenAI's upcoming LLM. Firstly, so far, the o-series models do not have a major overhaul in their architecture or framework but are fine-tuned to showcase enhanced capabilities.\n\nFor instance, developers used a technique with the o1 series of AI models called test-time compute. With this, the AI models were given additional processing time to spend on a question and a workspace to test the theories and correct any mistakes. Similarly, the GPT-4o model was just a fine-tuned version of the GPT-4.\n\nIt is unlikely that the company would have made major changes to the architecture with the o3 model, given that it is also rumoured to be working on the GPT-5 AI model, which could be launched later this year.\n\nComing to the ARC-AGI (Abstract Reasoning Corpus - Artificial General Intelligence) benchmark, it features a series of grid-based pattern recognition questions that require reasoning and spatial understanding capabilities to solve. This could be done with a large dataset of high-quality data focusing on reasoning and aptitude-based logic.\n\nHowever, if this were that simple, older AI models would have scored high on the test as well. Notably, the previous highest score was 55 percent as opposed to o3's 85 percent score. This highlights that the developers have added new refinement techniques and algorithms to enhance the reasoning capabilities of the model. The full extent of it cannot be stated unless OpenAI officially reveals the technical details.\n\nThat being said, it is unlikely that the o3 AI model would have reached AGI or human-level intelligence. Firstly, if that were the case, it would mark the end of the company's partnership with Microsoft, which is slated to end once OpenAI models hit the AGI status. Second, many AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, the godfather of AI, have repeatedly highlighted that we are multiple years away from reaching AGI.\n\nFinally, AGI is such a big accomplishment that if OpenAI did reach that milestone, it would explicitly let people know instead of sharing subtle hints about it. What is far more likely here is that the o3 AI model has found a way to improve the pattern-based reasoning capabilities of the model (either by adding enough sampling data or by tweaking the training methods), as also highlighted in a PTI report.\n\nHowever, this improvement is likely very isolated and does not mean an increase in the overall intelligence level of the model."

The changes will prolong COVID-19-era payment for remote care across all specialties.\n\nRelated: CMS deals telehealth a win, but sector still needs Congress' help\n\nFor many in mental health tech, new reimbursement codes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 November physician payment rule are an even bigger deal.\n\nThe codes reimburse providers for using digital mental health treatment applications or devices that have been cleared or granted De Novo authorization by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nWhile the codes are narrow in scope, analysts said the move signifies a larger recognition among CMS and commercial insurers that virtual platforms treating mental health should be reimbursed.\n\n\u201cThere has been a shortage of good mental health providers, and it is easy to argue that mental health services can be delivered in a virtual environment. No examination is needed,\u201d said Carrie Nixon, co-founder and managing partner of Nixon Gwilt Law, which works with digital health companies. \u201cThose factors have made mental and behavioral health the obvious jumping off point for all types of virtual, synchronous and asynchronous methods of delivering care.\u201d\n\nDigital therapeutics companies, which develop programs that can treat patients primarily through smartphone applications, have struggled because of a lack of reimbursement, said Andy Molnar, CEO of industry trade group the Digital Therapeutics Association.\n\nThe codes will be a lifeline for many behavioral health-focused digital therapeutics companies such as Big Health. The company has two FDA-cleared apps for treating insomnia and anxiety and is in line to benefit from CMS\u2019 new codes, said CEO Yael Berman.\n\nThere has been demand for Big Health\u2019s apps from providers looking for first-line treatment for sleeping disorders but no reimbursement, she said. The lack of reimbursement has limited its growth opportunities.\n\n\u201cReimbursement has really been the key barrier because we've had providers reaching out over the years, but there was no way to get them to be able to offer it to their patients unless it was free,\u201d Berman said.\n\nJoe Perekupka, CEO of digital therapeutics company Freespira, said the shortage of mental health providers requires a more progressive approach from the federal government in treating the mental health crisis. Perekupka said with these codes, he hope CMS is starting to recognize this need.\n\nFreespira, which offers a mobile health to reduce symptoms of panic disorder, panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder, is unsure its services fit within the scope of CMS\u2019 codes, Perekupka said. Still, he predicted the codes will open the door to expand for broader digital mental health treatments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a monumental shift in the philosophy at CMS,\u201d Perekupka said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a big shot of adrenaline into the arm of digital mental health treatment.\n\nOutside the therapeutics space, companies such as Brightside Health and Talkspace have seen a shift in mentality from the federal government. In May, virtual mental health company Talkspace began rolling out its services to Medicare members. The company is expecting Medicare members to adopt the program this year when it starts marketing their services, said Erin Boyd, chief growth officer.\n\nIn addition to changes at the federal level, more commercial insurers are actively engaging with mental health tech companies, Boyd said. Talkspace has shifted its focus over the past few years from a direct-to-consumer payment model to working with commercial insurers and employers. The payer business accounted for more than 65% of its revenue through the first nine months of 2024.\n\n\u201cAfter COVID, it just made sense to be in as many networks as possible,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cWe changed our marketing focus two years ago to really emphasize that you could use your insurance to get Talkspace, and that's been significant in changing the amount of registered users we have on the platform.\u201d\n\nWith the opportunities increasing for reimbursement, companies must prove their worth to CMS and commercial insurers, said Molnar at the trade group. If the codes aren\u2019t used or the outcomes data isn't showing a strong return on investment, CMS will move slowly to expand coverage, he said."

In the current study, investigators characterized trends in cardiovascular (CV)-related hospitalizations, health care costs, and procedural utilization.\n\nThe investigators conducted a retrospective analysis using discharge data and ICD-10 codes from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database 2016 to 2021 (costs adjusted and reported in 2023 dollars). The NIS is the largest all-payer, encounter-level database in the US for hospitalizations (about 7 million deidentified hospitalizations/year).\n\nThe investigators noted in 2021, the 4,687,370 cardiovascular-related hospitalizations in the US cost $108 billion. The highest costs, $18.5 billion, were accounted for by heart failure (HF), $11.2 billion by non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), and $10.9 billion by stroke. Adults aged at least 65 years accounted for 64% of all cardiac-related hospitalizations, and those aged 45 to 64 years accounted for 30% (55% men; 70% White; 16% Black; 9% Hispanic).\n\n\u201c \u2026cardiovascular disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2021, significant upward trends were noted in the following:\n\nHF\n\nStroke\n\nAtrial fibrillation\n\nSTEMI\n\nChest pain\n\nHypertensive emergency\n\nVentricular tachycardia\n\nAortic dissection\n\nSudden cardiac death\n\nPericarditis\n\nSupraventricular tachycardia\n\nPulmonary heart disease\n\nTotal costs increased over $10 billion across the study period, although not linearly, with significant declines likely related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Total CV-related costs by 2030 may reach $131.3 billion.\n\nProcedures most performed in all years included coronary, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), non-bypass peripheral vascular surgery, pacemaker replacement, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).\n\nStudy limitations include ICD codes may underreport primary diagnoses, NIS data are event-level related to discharge with unclear interpretation of how readmissions affect the data, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalizations and costs was undetermined.\n\n\u201cOverall, from the years 2016 to 2021, cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, costs, and procedures demonstrated upward trends,\u201d the investigators wrote. \u201c\u2026cardiovascular disease remains a high burden in the hospital setting with tremendous health care costs.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Some [or one] study author(s) declared affiliations with biotech, pharmaceutical, and/or device companies.

            "article_content": "In a discovery that feels like science brought fiction to life, researchers at the University of Toronto claim to have shown that 'negative time' is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible phenomenon. In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

            "article_content": "Philadelphia is widely recognized as one of the nation\u2019s leading centers for innovation and research, fueled by flourishing technology, education, medicine, and life sciences sectors.\n\nAt the heart of this thriving landscape, Temple University serves as a vital anchor. With a culture deeply rooted in innovation, the institution fosters an environment where a community of faculty, researchers, entrepreneurs, and investors turns ideas into reality. Together, they advance new products to the marketplace and found companies with societal impact.\n\nFrom new treatments for autoimmune disorders and gum disease to life-saving solutions for blood clots and electric vehicle safety, Temple researchers are at the forefront of science that matters. Here, we spoke with four teams that grew out of Temple\u2019s robust innovation ecosystem about how their products and technologies aim to make a big difference in the world. And right here in Philly.\n\nA Rapid, Lifesaving Solution for Dangerous Blood Clots\n\nDr. Riyaz Bashir has developed a novel technology to treat potentially deadly pulmonary embolisms, in a groundbreaking procedure that may be completed in less than an hour.\n\nPulmonary embolisms \u2014 blood clots that commonly form in the deep veins of the legs, then break off and travel into the vessels of the lungs \u2014 are gargantuan. Many times the size of other clots, and their sheer mass present a unique challenge for treatment: the amount of blood-thinning medication needed to dissolve them can also lead to excessive bleeding and time in the ICU, as a result.\n\n\u201cWe learned that if you fissure a clot to allow the patient\u2019s own healthy blood to flow through it and combine this with a small dose of clot-dissolving medicine, that rapidly dissolves it.\u201d Dr. Riyaz Bashir\n\nPulmonary embolisms \u2014 blood clots that commonly form in the deep veins of the legs, then break off and travel into the vessels of the lungs \u2014 are gargantuan. Many times the size of clots that cause a stroke, and their sheer mass, present a unique challenge for treatment: the amount of blood-thinning medication needed to dissolve them can also lead to excessive bleeding and time in the ICU, as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Riyaz Bashir, a professor at Temple University\u2019s Lewis Katz School of Medicine and a cardiologist at Temple University Hospital, was treating patients with embolisms at his practice day after day when he thought of a better treatment strategy than what was available at the time. He cofounded Thrombolex Inc. to develop and commercialize a solution to the challenge. The BASHIR\u2122 Endovascular Catheter consists of an expandable infusion basket that, when inserted into the site of the clot, cuts multiple fissures through the clot\u2019s mass to immediately restore the flow of blood.\n\n\u201cWe learned that if you allow a patient\u2019s own healthy blood to flow through a clot, that rapidly dissolves it,\u201d Bashir says, \u201cbecause it brings the body\u2019s own clot-dissolving chemicals into the clot.\u201d Clot-busting drugs can then be injected directly at the site, delivering targeted relief and reducing the risk of side effects. In independent studies, treatment with the catheter can be completed in less than an hour, compared to five hours for traditional methods that require an ICU admission. The procedure also resulted in a 29% reduction in the size of the blockage in just 48 hours. The device is now FDA-approved.\n\nAbout one-in-one-thousand people will develop a PE; the rate is consistent across different countries and demographics. One of the key benefits of this innovative technology is its ease of use. \u201cMy goal was that it should also benefit developing countries where they don\u2019t have the advanced facilities we do in the U.S.,\u201d Bashir says. In the United States, a few hundred thousand people annually stand to benefit from his invention. \u201cFor eight billion people worldwide,\u201d he says, \u201cyou can do the math as to how many lives we could potentially save.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Dr. Riyaz Bashir\u2019s work on treating pulmonary embolisms.\n\nA New, More Natural Approach to Drug Discovery\n\nDrs. Mark Feitelson and Alla Arzumanyan are using substances produced by the body to treat hepatitis, liver disease, and more.\n\nMuch ink has been spilled in recent years about the importance of gut biomes. It\u2019s often reported that the balance of good bacteria in our digestive tracts can affect everything from the strength of our immune systems to our energy levels and mood. But that may only be scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible with the molecules in our gut. Researchers are discovering that gut metabolites may have broader applications, like being used to treat conditions affecting other parts of the body including the skin, the liver, and the colon.\n\nSFA Therapeutics Inc., co founded by the Temple University researchers Mark Feitelson and Alla Arzumanyan, is drawing upon gut metabolites to treat disease and to advance our understanding of just how wide-ranging their applications may be. \u201cThe idea first came to me in about 2013,\u201d Feitelson, a professor of biology in Temple\u2019s College of Science and Technology, says. \u201cWe came across a scientific article about using bacterial metabolites to treat mice with colitis. And I thought, that\u2019s very interesting. You can give these things to a mouse orally, and it acts in the intestine; but what about everywhere else?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe nice thing about these substances is we don\u2019t have to optimize them, evolution already has. This is a fundamentally different way of thinking about how to discover and develop drugs.\u201d Dr. Mark Feitelson\n\nIn his research, Feitelson saw promising results in using metabolites to treat viral hepatitis and chronic liver disease. \u201cIt turns out a lot of the bad players involved in inflammation in the liver overlap with the bad players elsewhere,\u201d Feitelson says. It was Arzumanyan\u2019s idea to attempt treating psoriasis. In phase one trials, 92% of patients experienced improvement, and the team now has an array of patents for their compounds. They are exploring treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia, and lung damage caused by COVID-19 infection, among other diseases.\n\nOne of the big advantages of SFA\u2019s work is the potential for fewer side effects compared with traditional treatments. \u201cThe nice thing about these substances is we don\u2019t have to optimize them, evolution already has. This is a fundamentally different way of thinking about how to discover and develop drugs, and that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s also applicable to many different types of diseases,\u201d Feitelson says. Compared to conventional drugs, SFA\u2019s treatments act more harmoniously with the body. \u201cThe defining feature of our drug is modulation, rather than suppression,\u201d Arzumanyan, an associate professor in Temple\u2019s College of Science and Technology, says. \u201cWhen big pharma companies design a drug, they usually pick a molecule and design a drug that suppresses it below the baseline, causing side effects. Our drug brings them back to what they should be normally.\u201d\n\nLearn more about Drs. Mark Feitelson and Alla Arzumanyan\u2019s work to transform the treatment of autoimmune disorders and more.\n\nEnsuring the Safety of Electric Cars, for a Greener World\n\nDr. Elham Sahraei seeks to understand how lithium batteries respond during a collision.\n\nAs the world rapidly adopts the use of batteries over fossil fuels, safety is at the front of many people\u2019s minds. Stories about an electric car catching fire garner outsized attention from media and consumers, because the technology is new and unfamiliar \u2014 even if the risks aren\u2019t any greater compared with gas-powered vehicles. Understanding and improving the safety of electric batteries isn\u2019t important just for protecting users, it\u2019s also crucial for accelerating their mainstream adoption and reducing overall carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cBecause this is new technology, it\u2019s less understood than conventional vehicles.\u201d Dr. Elham Sahraei\n\nElham Sahraei, an associate professor in Temple\u2019s College of Engineering, is the director of the university\u2019s Electric Vehicle Safety Lab, dedicated to understanding what happens to electric batteries under extreme stress. The lab\u2019s experiments investigate what happens to batteries, like the kind that are used in electric vehicles, when they\u2019re impacted or punctured. The evidence gleaned from these experiments is combined with government vehicle crash safety data in order to model how the battery pack in a car is likely to behave during a collision. \u201cBecause this is new technology, it\u2019s less understood than conventional vehicles,\u201d Sahraei says. \u201cThe industry is very cautious, [and] trying to add lots of protection around the batteries to compensate for that lack of understanding.\u201d\n\nA better understanding of what the riskiest scenarios are for electric vehicles will produce better protections. Think of how passenger safety has improved for gas-powered cars: these vehicles were once rigid steel boxes, but now, modern cars include crumple zones that absorb and redirect the force of a crash around the driver and the passengers. Sahraei and her team\u2019s work entails producing similar concepts for protecting batteries. Now incubating at iNest, Temple\u2019s innovation hub, her early stage startup, Inovele LLC, is providing models and testing for vehicle makers to simulate and assess the performance of their own designs. It\u2019s a vital step for enticing us all into a cleaner, greener world.\n\nLearn more about Elham Sahraei\u2019s work innovating for safer roadways.\n\nA Revolutionary Nonsurgical Treatment for Periodontal Disease\n\nDrs. Santiago Orrego and Carolina Montoya\u2019s gel uses electricity harnessed by the movement of the jaw to treat periodontal disease by growing bone and controlling infection.\n\nIt sounds straight out of science fiction: a miraculous gel that helps the body regrow bone in the periodontal pocket. One weird thing about the human body is how it naturally regrows some parts, but not others: your hair comes back when cut, your bones will heal from breaks, but your teeth \u2014 not so much. Gum disease occurs when microbes trigger gum inflammation, causing the underlying bone to begin a process of self-destruction. In advanced cases, the bone below the tooth dies, leading the tooth to fall out. Current periodontitis treatments involve surgery, but now, there is a nonsurgical solution.\n\nAmbilux Dental Gel, a smart hydrogel, developed by Drs. Santiago Orrego and Carolina Montoya at Temple University, aims to reverse the effects of gum disease when deposited in the space between the gum and teeth. The gel contains piezoelectric materials, which convert the movement of one\u2019s jaw into an electrical charge that stimulates bone growth. All it takes is a few squirts with a syringe. Oral Biolife Inc. licensed the technology from Temple and is among the first to translate piezoelectric materials for dentistry. Their novel product is the result of many moving parts and paths of research, combining dentistry and engineering.\n\n\u201cWe work closely with practicing dentists to produce bioengineering-driven solutions for the challenges they face in the clinic.\u201d Dr. Santiago Orrego\n\nOrrego, an assistant professor with dual appointments in Temple\u2019s Kornberg School of Dentistry and College of Engineering, originally worked with piezoelectrics in his postdoctoral studies \u2014 developing, for example, a flag that generated enough electricity to charge batteries when it fluttered. Later, he began collaborating with Montoya, a research associate in Kornberg\u2019s Smart Biomaterials Lab, to apply those materials to treating dental disease. \u201cInside the body, employing piezoelectricity is a fairly new concept,\u201d Montoya says. \u201cCarolina and I are engineers by training,\u201d Orrego says. \u201cWe work closely with lots of practicing dentists to create the synergy to produce solutions for the difficult dental challenges they face.\u201d\n\nAnd the benefits don\u2019t stop at humans: periodontal disease affects about 80% of dogs, making this technology a potentially groundbreaking veterinary treatment, for the health of everyone\u2019s good boys and girls \u2014 a promising enough prospect to make anyone smile.\n\nLearn more about Drs. Santiago Orrego and Carolina Montoya\u2019s work regenerating bone tissue lost to periodontal disease.\n\nDennis Tang is a journalist, a novelist, and a creative writing professor based in Brooklyn, New York."

            "article_content": "Mensent Photography/Getty Images\n\nThere I was, minding my own bidness, watching Formula 1 videos on IG. \ud83e\udd70\n\nSam Altman pops up, talking about the future of AI as it relates to business owners.\n\nHe said that one day, we could see a one-person billion-dollar company. \ud83d\ude31\n\nMy first thought was, \"Dude is wilding.\" Then I thought, \"What if he's right?\"\n\nI promised myself I'd explore all new tech with an open mind since I learned my lesson from missing out on Bitcoin.\n\nAlso: I invested $50 in Bitcoin in 2022, and it's been a ride. Here's how much I have now\n\n(I'm still salty about not becoming a Bitcoin trillionaire from a $25 investment) \ud83d\ude2b\n\nUnderstandably, that missed opportunity still haunts me, but let's save that story for another day.\n\nSo, with all this in mind, I decided to do some detective work.\n\nToday, I will share my fascinating findings on AI tools that help everyday people like you and me build a software company without knowing how to code. \ud83e\udd2f\n\nIn this article, I'll also share:\n\nWhat tools to use\n\nA few ideas I have around what to build\n\nTips and tricks on how to get your first users\n\nI'll even give you some insight into the tool I built to help me with my workflow.\n\nBuckle up. This is going to be good.\n\nQuick intro\n\nIf you're new to my work, my name is Lester, but feel free to call me Les. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm a founder with a successful exit, but at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer. Like most people who have started an online business, I wish I knew how to code.\n\nAlso: AI isn't the next big thing - here's what is\n\nStarting out, I had to choose a direction: focus on the technical side of building products or lean into understanding people and how to reach them.\n\nI chose marketing as it aligned more with my strengths and interests. \ud83e\udd13\n\nThat said, you no longer have to make that choice. With a prompt, AI can help you create software and bring your ideas to life.\n\nMy experience using low-code/no-code\n\nSo, what are these magical AI tools where you input a prompt, and out comes a billion-dollar software company? \ud83e\ude84\n\nWhile there are a few out there, we will focus on Replit today.\n\nScreenshot by Lester Mapp/ZDNET\n\nReplit Agent is a tool that helps you build software using simple instructions. You can tell it what kind of app or website you want, and it will create it for you automatically. It works in the cloud, so you don't need to install anything on your computer. This makes it easy for anyone to make their programs quickly, even if they don't know how to code.\n\nReplit's claim to fame is \"No code needed.\" Its website says: \"Tell Replit Agent your app or website idea, and it will build it for you automatically. It's like having an entire team of software engineers on demand, ready to build what you need through a simple chat.\"\n\nBold claim!\n\nAlso: 3 lucrative side hustles you can start right now with OpenAI's Sora video generator\n\nBut for $25 bucks, I gave it a shot. You ain't gonna Bitcoin me twice in one lifetime. \ud83d\ude24\n\nWhat happened next? I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst, let me explain my workflow. A big part of my job is sending emails, especially cold emails.\n\nYou can use many services to find someone's email, but I have a personal beef with some of them. They're ridiculously, unfairly overpriced. So, I do the process manually.\n\nSure, it's not the best use of my time, but I'm a man of principle, dammit! \ud83d\ude20\n\nNow, the manual process is time-consuming but simple. Most businesses use the same structure for all employee emails.\n\nFor example, joe.smith@awesomecompany.com or john@awesomecompany.com.\n\nOnce you know the format and the name of your prospect, the next step is to verify it's an actual email. Again, there are plenty of services that can do this for you.\n\nAlso: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning\n\nDoing it manually is a pain, so I asked someone on our dev team to help me automate this process.\n\nAfter a quick review, they said, \"It'll take three weeks to build.\" Bruh!\ud83d\ude44\n\nThat didn't sit right with my spirit.\n\nThen it hit me: \"I wonder if Replit could help me build my email finder.\"\n\nI built my tool with a few prompts and started using it the same day.\n\nScreenshot by Lester Mapp/ZDNET\n\nThat's the power of tools like Replit. Now, let's be clear, you're not going to build the next Facebook with this tool (at least not yet).\n\nWe're still in the early stages of this technology, but if this is what the early days look like, I can only imagine how much better it will get.\n\nThe good, the bad and the kinda ugly\n\n\ud83d\udc4dLet's start with the good:\n\nReplit is easy to use\n\nIt works well for Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\n\nThe AI-assisted coding is clever\n\n\ud83d\udc4e Now, the bad:\n\nIt's buggy at times\n\nIt's not very robust when dealing with complex user interface designs\n\nCustomer support is spotty\n\n\ud83e\udd74 And the ugly:\n\nI don't like that even when the software makes a mistake, you still use your credits. You tell the AI agent to fix the issue, it makes the same mistake again, and you lose more credits.\n\nYou know when ChatGPT gets stuck in a loop? It's like that, but the difference is you're paying for it. I'm not a fan of the pricing model, but I get it.\n\nAlso: There's a new king of online shopping, and it's built an unstoppable monopoly\n\nWhile my project was simple for the most part, I see how tools like this could get annoying for more complicated tasks.\n\nOverall, no-code tools like Replit are a great place to start, but they're not the end-all, if you get what I mean. I can also see this tool being more powerful if you know what you're doing.\n\nIf I had to describe it, I'd say it makes intermediate coders great, but it doesn't make newbie coders great. This process could be challenging for someone completely new, and patience is not included with the $25 plan.\ud83d\ude2c\n\nWhat should you build?\n\nThis is the tricky part. I don't want to tell you what to do, but I'll share this.\n\nFollowing your passion is excellent advice for a hobby, but not so much if you're trying to build a meaningful business.\n\nYou need to ask yourself what kind of lifestyle you want. The bigger your ambition, the more you'll need to put into it to see meaningful results.\n\nSo start there. Sit with yourself and be honest. What do you want?\n\nMy unsolicited advice? Find the intersection of a big problem and something you can stay committed to.\n\nAlso: I'm an AI tools expert, and these are the only two I pay for\n\nThe truth is, no matter what path you take, you will face challenges. You won't feel motivated some days, so discipline and commitment matter more than anything else.\n\nYou'd probably quit at the first challenge if I told you what to do. That's why you should take the time to sit with your thoughts before making a decision. \ud83e\udd14\n\nThat said, here are a few software companies Replit says were built using its tool.\n\nvia Lester Mapp Replit.com\n\nMagicSchool.ai - An innovative platform with over 60 AI-powered tools designed to enhance the educational experience for teachers and students.\n\nAutomateNow.xyz - A platform that helps businesses streamline their operations through automation.\n\nGetCubicle.com - A straightforward productivity tool designed to enhance focus and efficiency. For a one-time fee of $10, it offers five key features.\n\nYou can also check out the Replit community for more ideas. Whatever you decide, remember this: you need to commit. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nMy two cents\n\nCan you build a billion-dollar business with just one person? Sure.\n\nSam may be on to something.\n\nI can see it happening, but it's not as simple as using a no-code tool and boom, you're rich.\n\nWhen it does happen, it will be a masterclass in marketing and solving the right problem at the right time.\n\nAlso: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today\n\nIf you're looking for a side hustle or how to build your startup, this is worth exploring. \ud83d\udd75\n\nBut here's a pro tip:\n\nIt's not about how hard you row; it's about the boat you're in, the problem you choose to solve, and for who is very, very, very, very important.\n\nOnce you figure out how to serve your users, remember that you're building something for real people. You need to understand them and know how to serve your community in the best way possible.\n\nIf you're unclear on how to market your new SaaS company, feel free to join my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts.

            "article_content": "Share on X (formerly known as Twitter)\n\nIt\u2019s been a bumpy ride for the automotive industry for a few years now. Supply chain shortages alongside inflation that slowed consumer spending and raised production costs have plagued the industry. As it forges ahead, what are the automotive trends to watch in 2025?\n\nElectrification and autonomous vehicles will remain megatrends transforming the industry, forcing automakers, suppliers, and dealers to adapt to new technologies and ways of doing business. In order to remain competitive, industry players will have to move fast.\n\nWith established automakers facing nimble startups in the mobility race, building new business should be a priority for auto executives, according to McKinsey & Company. Data-driven connectivity services and on-demand mobility could add up to $1.5 trillion to the automotive revenue pool by 2030, they said.\n\n2025 automotive trends\n\nAs auto leaders plan for growth, they\u2019ll be leaning on artificial intelligence. AI is impacting every aspect of the industry, and everything inside and outside of the car.\n\nThe automotive AI software market is expected to reach around $200 billion by 2032.\n\nExamples inside the vehicle include advanced sensors to virtual assistants, intuitive interaction with in-car infotainment, vehicle safety, and the relationship between vehicles and the environment. Outside of the vehicle, examples include customers being able to visualize car configurations in seconds, tools for dynamic pricing, improved supply chain management, and more efficient production.\n\nStellantis and Mercedes-Benz have integrated ChatGPT to allow passengers to interact more naturally with their vehicles. These systems act as virtual travel companions, offering insights on destinations and local attractions.\n\nAI plays a big role in the automotive trends for 2025:\n\nAutonomous driving: The pace of driverless car development will accelerate as the industry counts on growing consumer confidence in autonomous driving. Electrification: Electric vehicles will gain more traction, boosted by growing consumer demand, supportive regulations, and advancements in battery technology. Connectivity + the rise of the software-defined vehicle: Connectivity is set to transform the driving experience by integrating vehicles into the IoT ecosystem, using data to enable a highly personalized journey. Changing customer preferences: Automakers will focus on the customer more than ever in order to deliver the right services and experiences by understanding the customer\u2019s perspective and their individual preferences. Resilient supply chain + smart manufacturing: The automotive industry is strengthening its supply chain by diversifying suppliers, adopting advanced technology, and prioritizing sustainable practices. Servitization: Automakers are exploring new revenue models beyond selling products. This servitization trend will grow in 2025, as companies for ways to sell everything as a service. Sustainability: With sustainable sourcing, EV production, and the focus on e-mobility, the automotive industry is taking steps to reduce its environmental impact. Smart cities: Smart cities are set to have a profound impact on the automotive industry, reshaping business models and consumer behavior.\n\n1. Autonomous driving trend speeds ahead\n\nDespite years of excitement around emerging technology for autonomous driving, the pace of developing driverless cars and deploying them has been slower than originally anticipated. Expect that to change in 2025.\n\nRecent advances in technology have sped things up. The market for autonomous cars is expected to balloon from $60.3 billion in 2025 to $449 billion by 2035, achieving a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.2% during this period.\n\nBut the automotive industry has some work to do in breaking down barriers to widespread acceptance, as the greater public has mixed feelings about the autonomous driving trend.\n\nA Pew Research study found that 44% of Americans view self-driving cars as a bad for society. However, those under 50 were more open to riding in an autonomous vehicle compared to those over 50 (47% vs. 25%).\n\nIn 2025, building customer confidence in the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles through demonstrations, transparency about the technology used, and increased safety will be essential for earning public acceptance and achieving growth. Projections suggest autonomous driving could save 3,200 lives and prevent 53,000 serious accidents by 2040.\n\n2. Automotive trends: E-vehicles race to the top\n\nThe electrification of vehicles aligns naturally with the rise of autonomous driving, thanks to shared technological compatibility, environmental benefits, and economic advantages. Electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining traction as a viable alternative to traditional combustion-engine cars.\n\nThis shift towards e-mobility is driven by growing consumer demand, supportive regulations, and advancements in battery technology.\n\nDeloitte projects that by 2025, 18% to 36% of all vehicles sold will include alternative powertrains such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrids, or fuel cells.\n\nEVs could account for over 20 million in sales by 2025, representing as much as 23% of the global light-vehicle market and nearly 20% of total global vehicle sales, according to estimates. By contrast, sales of combustion engine vehicles are expected to sharply decline, potentially disappearing in major markets such as China, North America, and Germany by 2030.\n\nTo encourage EV uptake, governments are introducing subsidies and tax incentives, while automakers are teaming up with tech firms to achieve \u201cemissions-free\u201d technology and advance carbon-neutral mobility for a sustainable future.\n\nHowever, widespread EV adoption depends on overcoming infrastructure challenges, such as availability of charging stations. High prices are another barrier. Fortunately, advances in battery technology over the next few years are likely to reduce battery costs, making EVs more affordable and accessible.\n\nThis content is hosted by a third party ( vimeo.com ).

Connectivity and the rise of the software-defined vehicle\n\nConnectivity is set to transform the driving experience by integrating vehicles into the internet of things (IoT) ecosystem, using data to enable a highly personalized journey.\n\nImagine your car \u201cshopping\u201d for you, suggesting errands optimized by proximity, recommending a coffee stop when it senses your fatigue\u2014and even paying for it in advance! The connected vehicle trend aims to make every moment of your drive more efficient and enjoyable.\n\nThe software-defined vehicle (SDV) trend goes a step beyond connectivity, relying on software updates rather than hardware changes to maintain peak performance.\n\nTraditional vehicles require mechanical maintenance and can face recall delays due to parts shortages, with back-ordered components sometimes taking months to arrive. SDVs can be continuously improved, updated, and customized with over-the-air (OTA) updates, much like the software updates for smartphones or laptops. These updates deliver new features, performance enhancements, and bug fixes directly to the vehicle without any need for a visit to the shop.\n\nThe global connected car market is projected to grow significantly, from $56 billion in 2020 to $121 billion in 2025, according to Statista.\n\nExperts anticipate that over 400 million connected vehicles will be in use next year, fueled by partnerships between tech companies and automakers.\n\nFor example, automaker Stellantis teamed up with Amazon to develop its \u201csmart cockpit,\u201d an electronic platform set to be featured in vehicles across the company\u2019s 14 brands.\n\nIn essence, connectivity is poised to redefine how consumers interact with their vehicles and how automakers compete in the market.\n\n4. Automotive industry adapts to 2025 customer preferences\n\nThe growth of connected vehicles and personalized driving experiences means that automakers will focus on the customer more than ever. In order to deliver the right services and experiences, they need to understand the customer\u2019s perspective and their individual preferences.\n\nConnected vehicles provide real-time insights into customers, vehicles, and usage. In customer-facing processes, companies can apply digitization, automation, and AI to provide cohesive experiences across all sales channels.\n\nAutomakers are partnering with tech companies to develop smart features, integrating vehicles with IoT, and offering services such as remote updates, safety enhancements, and urban infrastructure connectivity.\n\nThis automotive customer-centric trend comes as consumer auto buying preferences continue to shift. Younger demographics, especially Gen Z, increasingly favor eco-friendly, tech-focused mobility options.\n\nA Cars.com survey found that 54% of Gen Zers would consider buying an EV compared to 41% of Gen Xers. Gen Zers cited long-term financial advantages and reduced environmental impact as reasons they might buy an EV.\n\n5. Resilient supply chain: 2025 automotive trend\n\nThe automotive industry is strengthening its supply chain by diversifying suppliers, adopting advanced technology, and prioritizing sustainable practices. This trend helps manufacturers avoid supply chain disruption so they can meet consumer demands reliably.\n\nTo reduce reliance on single sources, automakers are diversifying their supplier base. Integrating AI and IoT into the supply chain enables real-time monitoring and faster response to disruptions.\n\nNearly 42% of auto executives surveyed by SAP said improving or expanding supplier and partner networks is a top priority in their business growth plans.\n\nLast year, the carmaker Renault Group renewed its partnership with the prestigious \u00c9cole des Ponts ParisTech in order to accelerate innovation in the supply chain using AI.\n\nSustainable sourcing is another trend, with renewable materials reducing risks. By adopting flexible, tech-forward, and sustainable practices, the automotive industry is building a robust supply chain capable of withstanding challenges, from natural disasters to global pandemics.\n\n6. Auto industry leans into servitization\n\nLike other manufacturers, automakers are exploring new revenue models beyond selling products. This servitization trend will grow in 2025, as companies find ways to sell everything as a service.\n\nThe global XaaS market is expected to grow to $3,221.96 billion by 2030, up from $699.79 billion in 2023.\n\nIn the automotive industry, business networks will be key for expanding into a services model. The network can provide bundled mobility services and subscriptions based on vehicle data. Examples include insurance packages, helping customers reduce their carbon footprint, and connecting them to maintenance services.\n\nServitization provides ongoing revenue while improving the driver experience and reducing environmental impact. Automakers can leverage it to support both vehicle ownership and alternatives like leasing and renting.\n\n7. Driving towards sustainability\n\nWith sustainable sourcing, EV production, and the focus on e-mobility, the automotive industry is taking steps to reduce its environmental impact, but has a long way to go: It\u2019s responsible for more than 10% of global carbon dioxide emissions, according to a World Economic Forum report.\n\nHowever, the industry is demonstrating a commitment to change with a relentless focus on increasing electric vehicle adoption and supply chain decarbonization, the report noted.\n\nCircular economy practices such as battery recycling and increased traceability also are helping to make auto supply chains more sustainable.\n\nIndustry collaboration plays a big role here. For example, Catena-X developed a uniform, secure data exchange system with multiple partners, including carmakers, suppliers, and others, to enable end-to-end traceability.\n\nAI innovations also increase efficient, eco-friendly mobility by optimizing vehicle routes, improving traffic flow, and guiding fuel-saving and emission-reducing driving practices.\n\n8. The smart cities effect\n\nSmart cities are set to have a profound impact on the automotive industry, reshaping business models and consumer behavior. Smart cities are urban areas designed to leverage technology, data, and connectivity to improve efficiency, sustainability, and residents\u2019 quality of life.\n\nIncreased connectivity will make vehicles part of the broader city infrastructure, enabling real-time data sharing to improve traffic flow and safety. For example, San Francisco, Phoenix, and Beijing were among the first cities to embrace driverless or robot taxis. These cars use the highest level of autonomy, relying on sensors and AI to detect their surroundings, read and analyze the information from the environment, then decide on an action and implement it.\n\nBy 2030, more than one in three kilometers driven could involve sharing concepts, and autonomous mobility could account for up to 40% of a smart city\u2019s overall traffic.\n\nSmart cities will influence everything from vehicle connectivity and urban mobility to operational strategies. As vehicle design, manufacturing, and urban planning evolve with smart city initiatives, automakers must keep up with this growing trend.\n\nThe road ahead for the auto industry\n\nWhile there are a lot of opportunities ahead for automakers and others in the industry, there will be plenty of challenges. Cost pressures, increased competition, and globalization will remain constant pressures on auto leaders as they look to remain competitive.\n\nThe growing trend of shared mobility also looms large as more people use shared transportation methods instead of owning cars. This will be a factor in slowing the growth rate of global auto sales from 3.6% in recent years to about 2% by 2030, according to McKinsey & Company.\n\nThe decline will be offset by shared vehicles that need more frequent replacement as well as growth in emerging markets like China, they said.\n\nAuto brands that stay on top of these trends and continue to innovate can build a resilient business as we head towards a more electrified, autonomous, connected, and sustainable future."

            "article_content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.26%) is home to 500 companies from 11 different sectors of the economy, making it the most diversified of the major U.S. stock market indexes.\n\nBut the S&P is weighted by market capitalization, so the largest companies have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest. As of this writing, the following five companies have a combined market cap of $14.9 trillion, representing 28.8% of the entire value of the index:\n\nApple AAPL -0.20% ) Nvidia NVDA 4.45% ) Microsoft MSFT 1.14% ) Alphabet GOOG 1.31% ) GOOGL 1.25% ) Amazon AMZN 1.80% )\n\nThe S&P 500 delivered a return of 25% during 2024, whereas the S&P 500 Equal Weight index, which assigns the same weighting to every stock regardless of its market cap, was up by just 10%. The difference can be partly explained by the average gain of 61% in the preceding five stocks.\n\nA lot of the value those five companies created in 2024 came from their efforts in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. They are forecast to spend hundreds of billions of dollars combined this year in their quest for AI supremacy. If it pays off, they could become even more influential over the S&P 500.\n\n1. Apple: 7.6% of the S&P 500\n\nApple recently launched its Apple Intelligence software for users of the latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. It includes a suite of new AI-powered writing tools that can summarize emails and texts and instantly generate replies on command. Apple Intelligence can also prioritize users' notifications after learning their preferences.\n\nEven the Siri voice assistant got an upgrade thanks to an integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nApple Intelligence makes use of the company's latest chips -- the A18 Pro for the iPhone, and the M3 and M4 for iPads and Macs -- which were specifically designed for processing AI workloads on-device. This hardware, and the future generations that will follow, paves the way for Apple to continue pushing the boundaries of the AI revolution with new features.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, so this company could eventually become the biggest distributor of AI to consumers, bar none.\n\n2. Nvidia: 6.6% of the S&P 500\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered the first AI supercomputer to OpenAI in 2016. Now, it's the leading supplier of graphics processors (GPUs) for developing AI, and most tech giants are clamoring to put them in their data centers.\n\nNvidia just started shipping its new Blackwell GB200 GPUs, which offer a substantial leap in performance over its previous generations. The Blackwell-based GB200 NVL72 system, for example, can perform AI inference at up to 30 times the speed of the equivalent H100 system. That gives developers the computing power they need to deploy the largest AI models to date.\n\nDemand is significantly outstripping supply for Blackwell chips, and they're likely to be the dominant driver of Nvidia's sales growth. The company is on track to generate a record $128.6 billion in total revenue during fiscal 2025, which wraps up at the end of this month, followed by almost $200 billion in fiscal 2026.\n\nDespite an 800% gain over the past two years, Nvidia stock might still be cheap, so it could become an even larger piece of the S&P 500 this year and beyond.\n\n3. Microsoft: 6.3% of the S&P 500\n\nMicrosoft rocked the tech sector at the start of 2023, when it announced plans to invest $10 billion in OpenAI. It has since used the startup's technology to launch its own AI virtual assistant called Copilot, which is now embedded in its flagship software products, including Windows, Edge, and Bing.\n\nCopilot can also be added to the 365 productivity suite for an extra monthly subscription fee. It allows users to instantly create text and image content in Word and PowerPoint, which can speed up their workflows. Organizations around the world pay for 365 for more than 400 million of their employees, so even if only a fraction of them add Copilot, it could become a big source of recurring revenue.\n\nThe OpenAI partnership also helped Microsoft launch a portfolio of AI services on its Azure cloud platform. Azure AI has become a go-to destination for developers seeking state-of-the-art data center computing infrastructure and ready-made large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's latest o1 series to build their own AI software.\n\nMicrosoft allocated $55.7 billion to capital expenditures during its fiscal 2024, which ended June 30, and most of that figure was related to AI data centers and chips. It had already spent a further $20 billion during its fiscal 2025 first quarter, ended Sept. 30, so it's on track to invest a record amount in its AI ambitions during the current year.\n\n4. Alphabet: 4.1% of the S&P 500\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, which has a 90% market share in the internet search business. AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are transforming the way people access information online, which is threatening traditional search engines like Google. To protect its dominance, Alphabet launched its own family of AI models, called Gemini, along with a chatbot with the same name, but it's also using them to change how Google Search responds to queries.\n\nIn the past, people would enter a query into Google Search and it would produce a list of links to third-party websites. Now, an increasing number of queries return a text-based response at the top of the results, which is generated by AI. Alphabet is taking that to the next level with its new AI Overviews feature, which incorporates text, images, and links to third-party websites to provide a more holistic answer to almost any question.\n\nAlphabet says the links within Overviews receive more clicks than if they appeared in traditional search results instead, which is great news since Google Search accounts for most of the conglomerate's total revenue. If Alphabet successfully pulls off this transition, not only will it protect its dominant market share, but it might also create an opportunity to generate record amounts of revenue by selling ad spots to businesses in Overviews.\n\n5. Amazon: 4.1% of the S&P 500\n\nAmazon is the world's largest e-commerce company, and it's integrating AI into the entire customer experience. It offers a virtual shopping assistant called Rufus that can help customers find the most suitable product for their needs. It even uses a tool called Project Private Investigator inside its fulfillment centers, which uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they're shipped out to reduce costly returns.\n\nThen there's Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's largest provider of cloud services. It wants to dominate the three core layers of AI: data center infrastructure, LLMs, and software. To achieve this goal, AWS designed its own chips, its own family of models called Titan, and its own AI virtual assistant called Q.\n\nAWS generated $27.4 billion in total revenue during the third quarter of 2024, which ended Sept. 30. That was a 19% increase from the year-ago period. However, AI revenue within AWS soared by a triple-digit percentage, and Amazon says this business is growing three times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its lifecycle.\n\nAmazon allocated around $75 billion to AI capital expenditures during 2024, and it's likely to spend even more in 2025 to cement its leadership position."

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nGraphics are a huge part of the PC gaming experience. Unfortunately, not every computer is built for the best games on the market. Laptops and pre-built PCs don't always ship with the best possible specs. And if you built your computer, it can be very expensive to update the internal components.\n\nIf you want to play the latest and greatest games, but aren't sure if your PC can handle them, you'll need to know what graphics card you have installed. Once you have this information, you can then compare it to the minimum requirements for the game you want to play. Here's how to figure it out.\n\nOur Top-Rated Graphics Cards\n\nWhat's a Graphics Card?\n\nWhen you turn on your computer, the images that appear on the screen\u2014whether it's a simple Word document or a complex 4K gaming experience\u2014are generated by a graphics processing unit (or GPU). These chips can range from simple \"integrated graphics,\" which are part of the motherboard or processor, to larger, more powerful expansion cards that have their own fan system.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese cards\u2014often called \"discrete\" or \"dedicated\" graphics cards\u2014can usually perform more powerful tasks than integrated graphics, like better 3D gaming, accelerated video rendering, or even certain non-graphical jobs like mining Bitcoin. This extra utility comes at the expense of higher power usage, increased heat, and more space in your computer, which is why you won't find dedicated graphics cards in ultra-thin laptops.\n\nThere are two main components of a graphics card: the chip that does the work, and the card (which includes other hardware like the cooler, voltage regulation module, and so on). There are two main chip manufacturers today: Nvidia and AMD (though Intel's Arc line has also hit the market). There are many card manufacturers\u2014Asus, EVGA, MSI, Gigabyte\u2014that use these chips, adding their own tweaks to set themselves apart. One manufacturer's version may have better fans, can come overclocked, or have a better warranty.\n\nKnowing what graphics card you have can be confusing, since the chip itself has its own model number that's separate from the card's model number. So when you're looking up what graphics card you have, you'll need to decide whether knowing the chipset is enough (for example, the \"Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060\") or whether you need the actual manufacturer and model of the card (such as the \"EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 Superclocked,\" which uses Nvidia's chipset). The former is very easy to find in Windows, while the latter is a bit more complicated.\n\nJust like any other computer component, graphics cards can become outdated over time. The card you bought in 2015 is unlikely to play 2025's AAA games at high settings, so if you're ever unsure whether a game like Elden Ring will run on your PC, you'll want to compare its minimum or recommended requirements to the hardware you currently have.\n\nFind Out What GPU You Have in Windows\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out what graphics card you have from the Windows Device Manager. Type \"Device Manager\" into the Start menu and press Enter to launch the Control Panel. Click the drop-down arrow next to Display adapters, and it should list your GPU. If you aren't sure which company designed the chip, right-click on it and choose Properties to see the manufacturer\u2014AMD, in my case. (Note that Device Manager uses your graphics drivers to determine what GPU you have, so if you suspect the wrong drivers may be installed, skip to the next section.)\n\nOnce you have the GPU name, you can compare it to the minimum requirements on the game you want to play. Usually, a higher number denotes a better card\u2014so a game that requires an RX 580 may not run well on an RX 480, which is less powerful (though there are sometimes ways around that). If you're comparing two cards that use different naming schemes\u2014like AMD's RX 580 and the more powerful RX Vega 56\u2014you may have to do a little research to see which card is more powerful. Information like release year and price can usually give you the answer.\n\nFind the Manufacturer and Model Number\n\nIf, for some reason, you need to know exactly what model video card you have, you'll have to do a bit more work. The manufacturer is easy enough to find with a third-party app called Speccy. Download the free version, start it up, and click the Graphics option in the sidebar. Scroll down and look for the Subvendor entry, which should tell you who made the card in your PC. (You'll also be able to see how much video RAM your card has, among other specs.)\n\nUnfortunately, this won't tell you the exact model number, which you'll need for, say, warranty claims or tech support. (Asus makes a few different RX 580 cards, and they'll need the exact model number to help.) For that, you'll need to search your email for the receipt (if you bought the card online). Otherwise, you'll need to open the PC up. In this case, find the graphics card, remove it, and look at the sticker on the side\u2014it should have the model number you need.\n\nMake sure to write this information down somewhere so you don't need to crack your PC open next time\u2014you never know when you might need it!"

            "article_content": "Thanks to Taiwanese manufacturer PowerColor, we now have our first glimpse at what the next-gen AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT might look like. These teased images of the future flagship card from AMD come just days before we expect to hear an official announcement from the chip maker at the CES 2025 trade show, with this particularly fiendish card expected to join PowerColor\u2019s red-themed Red Devil GPU series.\n\nThis new flagship RDNA 4 graphics card from AMD will be its best attempt to break through the dominance that Nvidia has held over the GPU market since producing the best graphics cards of recent years. There\u2019s potential to be excited, too, with recent rumors suggesting that it might offer ray tracing performance that matches the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, despite speculation earlier this year that AMD was abandoning high-end Radeon GPUs completely.\n\nThe possible first glimpse at the RX 9070 XT came via a post on X (formerly Twitter) by PowerColor. In a cryptic post, the GPU maker shared a tease of its new graphics card with a look at the GPU\u2019s backplate design. According to a report by wcctech.com, their analysis suggests that this particular backplate doesn\u2019t match up to existing RX 7900 GPUs and is instead from an unreleased card.\n\nThe first image doesn\u2019t give too much away, but it does show what looks to be a metal backplate with PowerColor\u2019s Red Devil logo prominently displayed. Another X post, however, showed off a much clearer look at the new card, with three fans and a prominent red LED-lit, crystal-like structure on the end of the card.\n\nWhile there\u2019s admittedly nothing specific linking these images to the RX 9070 XT in PowerColor\u2019s posts, another X user suggested in response to this image that the \u201c9000 series [is] looking good\u201d and, in response, PowerColor teasingly replied \u201c9000 series eh?\u201d with an emoji.\n\nAs for when this card might become available, RX 9000 launch speculation from earlier this week suggests the timescale for these flagship GPUs hitting shop shelves will be around February. This will only be for the flagship AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT, though, with lower range cards arriving in March, according to leaked information.\n\nWhat we do know is that PowerColor\u2019s Red Devil branding has, so far, been used for mildly overclocked versions of AMD GPUs, but there will likely be no information about specs until AMD announces the GPU itself.\n\nOne way or another, AMD is expected to launch this new card next week at the CES 2025 trade show, which is when we\u2019ll get our first official look at the GPU itself. In the meantime, check out our AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT guide for all the recent rumors and leaks about this new flagship GPU so far."

This isn\u2019t just another hype cycle.\n\nFirst, we need to talk about the elephant in the room: generative AI. The computational demands of running generative AI models make traditional cloud deployments look like a kid\u2019s lemonade stand. According to Gartner\u2019s projections, enterprise AI workloads will consume more than 30% of total cloud infrastructure capacity by 2025. Considering the elevation of AI-driven cloud spending, that transition is underway right now.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker\u2014and I\u2019ve been shouting this from the rooftops to anyone who will listen\u2014public cloud costs are becoming the board room\u2019s newest headache. The \u201clift-and-shift\u201d parties of the past decade have created massive technical debt. CFOs are choking on their morning coffee when they see the bills. We\u2019re talking about companies spending two or three times what they initially budgeted for cloud services, and that\u2019s before adding AI workloads into the mix."

            "article_content": "In a discovery that feels like science brought fiction to life, researchers at the University of Toronto claim to have shown that 'negative time' is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible phenomenon. In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"
