        "article_content": "Area 51 is the most famous alien base shrouded in mystery and conspiracy theories\n\nAn infamous part of America has been \"revealed\" to be the home of another alien base. A lawyer, Danny Sheehan has worked to bring UFO whistleblowers to the United States Congress over recent years. Alien base conspiracy theories have cropped up time and time again but Mr Sheehan has helped to give evidence of alleged government cover-ups involving extraterrestrial beings. There have been some serious allegations made including that at the locations of two bases, hundreds of UFOs have been seen going \u201cin and out of it\u201d. Mr Sheehan spoke on Julian Dorey\u2019s podcast about the potential location of alien bases in the US.\n\nThe Arizona mountains are allegedly home to a secret alien base\n\nHe said one base is under the sea bed off the island of Isla Guadalupe and another is hidden away on land. Mr Sheehan added: \u201cThere's another base outside of Sedona, Arizona, over by a place called 'secret mount' wilderness \u2013 a totally desolate area. \u201cThere's a base there where the craft are, there's a number of them high in the mountains in remote areas of the planet and they're here now and they're extraordinarily distressed about the state of affairs (of humanity).\u201d In terms of what lies inside, Mr Sheehan claimed aliens were \u201cmantis people\u201d who could have advanced weaponry. When asked what the \u201cmantis people\u201d are, he said: \u201cThey are huge, seven feet tall, extraordinarily skinny, thin, kind of bowed over and remind people of a praying mantis... they are also called 'insectoids'. Whenever they're seen with tall greys, they seem to be in charge... giving telepathic commands.\u201d\n\nMany conspiracy theorists are keen to share their thoughts on UFO and alien sightings\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

        "source": "Windows Latest",
        "article_content": "Claude has a new \u201capp\u201d for Windows 11/10, and I tried it out. And guess what? It simply loads https://claude.ai/ in an Electron Chromium container. For those who are unaware, Chromium powers most of the browsers you use today, such as Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, and Arc.\n\nThere used to be a time when companies and developers tried building full-fledged apps, native apps that matched the look and feel of Windows. Native apps are still shipped on MacOS or iOS, but I feel that the \u201cera\u201d is long gone on Windows 11/10 and is not coming back unless somebody is building advanced apps.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s new apps are mostly based on Edge WebView, and its competitors also prefer to ship web-based apps. Worse, they use the slower Chromium instead of Microsoft Edge (Edge WebView). After ChatGPT\u2019s Chromium Windows app, Claude has also shipped a similar app.\n\nLike ChatGPT, Claude\u2019s app for Windows 11 (and Windows 10) is powered by Electron.\n\nIn our tests, Windows Latest observed that the Claude AI\u2019s app is using an Electron (Chromium) wrapper. We can tell because there are several files typically found in Electron applications. For example, files like \u201cchrome_100_percent.pak\u201d and \u201cchrome_200_percent.pak\u201d are often part of the Chromium engine.\n\nWe also spotted files like \u201clibEGL.dll,\u201d \u201clibGLESv2.dll,\u201d and \u201cvulkan-1.dll\u201d, which confirms Claude is using Chromium\u2019s rendering engine.\n\nThese are used by Electron to render web content. Electron itself is not necessarily bad, and apps like Notion Ink or Slack also use Electron but deliver a good experience.\n\nIn the case of Claude, it\u2019s simply loading the AI\u2019s website. It doesn\u2019t make sense to use Electron when all it tries to load is the website in a Chromium shell.\n\nAn Electron Chromium wrapper is heavier than using Edge WebView2 (pre-installed in Windows 11). Claude is installing its own Chromium bundle, which is why it could take more than 200 MB of storage space after some use.\n\nThis is more than the new Copilot app, another web wrapper, but it takes less than a megabyte of space on your PC.\n\nThe large size and increased resource consumption come from the fact that it\u2019s shipping its own version of Chromium. This is similar to carrying an entire instance of Chrome inside it, which could contribute to increased RAM usage when you use the app.\n\nThis goes for the ChatGPT app for Windows 11, too.\n\nClaude\u2019s new app for Windows 11 (and Windows 10) is completely free, and anyone, including those with paid subscription ($20) can access it. For some reason, Claude\u2019s app is not available in the Microsoft Store, so you\u2019ll need to download it from the company\u2019s website.\n\nWe absolutely see no reason to use the Electron-based Claude over its webpage unless you want to try the Ctrl+Alt+Space keyboard shortcut to open Claude AI anywhere on Windows in a small flyout.\n\nDo you really need these AI apps on Windows?\n\nIf you want to use ChatGPT or Claude on Windows, we recommend accessing them via your browser unless you really want to use some of the desktop-exclusive features.\n\nClaude offers no advantage over its website except the picture in picture mode, which is also available in ChatGPT (screenshot below).\n\nHowever, the ChatGPT app has another advantage over the website: advanced voice mode on the desktop. This allows you to talk to ChatGPT like a human.\n\nCopilot has a similar feature called \u201cVision,\u201d which is more advanced than ChatGPT\u2019s integration. However, it\u2019s still being tested in Microsoft Edge, and we don\u2019t know when it will ship to everyone.\n\nWith Copilot Vision, you\u2019ll be able talk about the Microsoft Edge screen using your voice in real time."

Western Slope Paranormal is a group of local investigators studying potential hauntings.\n\nThe Elk\u2019s Lodge, Avalon Theater, and The Goat and Cover Tavern are few of the many local haunted stops on the ghost walk. Paranormal Investigator, Nina Carrillo, says activity is often detected using a flash light. During investigations she sets it in an area away from her, and asks questions promoting a response. Often times activity will reply by turning on the light, without anyone touching it.\n\nInvestigators also works with local community members and businesses to address their concerns of paranormal activity. They travel to private residencies and conduct investigations, answering questions and help provide peace of mind.\n\nWhile Halloween wraps up the ghost walks for the season, the organization remains involved with the community by hosting fundraisers and monthly meetings.

It is newsworthy when archeologists and paleontologists find a new location that contains fossils, but what about the first fossil discovery?\n\nChrissy: The earliest recorded discovery of a remnant of dinosaur history was in 1676 when Robert Plot found a huge thigh bone in England. Back in the early 17th century, dinosaurs weren't something that were part of public common knowledge, so these finds were either thought to belong to huge humans or mythical creatures.\n\nJasmine: It wasn't until the early 1800's that it was suspected that giant animals once roamed the earth and not giant humans. Gideon Mantell found a gigantic fossil while digging in the Sussex quarry which turned out to be one of the first known lguanodon teeth to ever be found. This was a key turning point in how scientists dug for and classified fossils.\n\nChrissy: A quest for paleontology supremacy brought forth the discovery of many new dinosaur genre during the American Gilded Age of the 19th Century. \"The Bone Wars\", a fierce and underhanded competition between Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope, saw the use of bribery, theft, destruction of bones, funding tampering, and public attacks in scientific publications that went on to publicly ruin both men financially and in reputation. Their losses brought forth gains for the Stegosaurus, Allosaurus, and Triceratops.\n\nJasmine: In the mid 1800's the word \"dinosaur\" was first coined by Sir Richard Owen, an English biologist and paleontologist. He recognized these giant ancient animals as the order of Dinosauria and began the modern era of dinosaur research and classification.\n\nChrissy: You've been listening to The Sound of Science on WNIJ, where you learn something new every day."

        "article_content": "Prime numbers may not be at the forefront of everyday conversation, but for Luke Durant, a 36-year-old former programmer at Nvidia, they represent a captivating challenge that led him to an astonishing achievement. After dedicating nearly a year of his life and a significant investment of his own resources, Durant has uncovered the largest known prime number to date, a monumental feat in the realm of mathematics.\n\nWhat Is A Prime Number?\n\nTo understand the significance of Durant\u2019s discovery, it\u2019s essential to define prime numbers. A prime number is any whole number greater than one that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers; it can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. Common examples include 2, 3, 5, and 7. Durant\u2019s discovery, known as M136279841, boasts an extraordinary 41,024,320 digits, marking it the first significant prime breakthrough in nearly six years.\n\nThe Significance Of Mersenne Primes\n\nThe prime number unearthed by Durant is classified as a Mersenne prime, a category named after the French monk Marin Mersenne, who studied these unique numbers over 350 years ago. Mersenne primes are exceedingly rare and can only be expressed in the form 2\u1d56-1, where p itself is a prime number. This particular discovery stands out as the 52nd known Mersenne prime, adding to the historical significance of the find.\n\nDr. Kevin Buzzard, a professor of pure mathematics at Imperial College London, emphasized the importance of such discoveries. \u201cThe historical record of the world\u2019s largest prime tells us something about the historical capability of computers, and in particular, it tells us something about the progress of humanity in this area,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Role Of GIMPS In Discovering Primes\n\nDurant\u2019s groundbreaking achievement was announced by the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) on October 21. GIMPS is a citizen science project that encourages volunteers worldwide to run software on their personal computers to search for new prime numbers. According to Durant, \u201cI recognized that the GIMPS community has put together an incredible system with amazing technology for searching for huge prime numbers.\u201d\n\nAfter familiarizing himself with GIMPS\u2019s software and leveraging cloud computing capabilities, Durant effectively created a powerful supercomputer by combining resources from systems around the globe.\n\nThe question arises: what drives thousands of volunteers, including Durant, to seek out the world\u2019s largest primes? For Durant, it is a blend of his fascination with developing large computing systems and exploring the boundaries of physics and computational capabilities. \u201cI wanted to push the boundaries of the known universe in whatever small way I was able,\u201d he explained. \u201cThese enormous prime numbers are, in some senses, the largest \u2018unique pieces of information\u2019 in the known universe.\u201d\n\nHow It Actually Happened?\n\nDespite the lack of practical applications for extremely large prime numbers, the significance of such finds remains profound for the community involved. George Woltman, founder of GIMPS, described the discovery as a \u201crare and beautiful gem\u201d for mathematics enthusiasts. He expressed hope that these discoveries could inspire future generations of mathematicians.\n\nDurant received an initial alert regarding his discovery on October 12, just as he was preparing for a trip. \u201cI took a moment to decide if I felt up to work on it immediately to confirm the new number to be prime,\u201d he recalled. He ultimately chose to prioritize his discovery, recognizing its importance.\n\nTo confirm the primality of a number, GIMPS utilizes a series of tests, starting with a probable prime test. If successful, the number undergoes multiple definitive tests across different systems to verify its status as a new Mersenne prime.\n\nEven for someone with Durant\u2019s experience, the exhilaration of the discovery was palpable. \u201cI\u2019m extremely fortunate to be the discoverer of the most recent Mersenne prime number,\u201d he said. He expressed his readiness to invest significant effort, fully aware of the challenges involved in such an ambitious pursuit.\n\nDurant\u2019s achievement is particularly noteworthy as the first Mersenne prime found utilizing graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs excel at performing mathematical calculations rapidly and handling multiple data streams simultaneously. This advancement signifies a notable shift in prime number discovery methods, moving away from traditional central processing units (CPUs).\n\nMihai Preda, who developed the GpuOwl software available to GIMPS users since 2017, played a vital role in paving the way for Durant\u2019s groundbreaking discovery. The GPUs that Durant employed demonstrated remarkable efficiency in executing repetitive mathematical calculations, enhancing his computational capabilities significantly.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nWoltman anticipates that the utilization of GPUs will lead to more discoveries of prime numbers in the future. \u201cGPUs are so good at tackling difficult number crunching compared to CPUs which are suited to a wide variety of problems,\u201d he remarked. However, he also noted that CPUs will continue to play a critical role in GIMPS and could potentially yield the next prime number.\n\nDurant attributes much of his success to his education at the Alabama School of Mathematics and Science in Mobile, which fostered his interests and technical skills. \u201cMy interests and technical abilities are in no small part due to my fellow students and faculty at ASMS,\u201d he shared.\n\nAs a result of his groundbreaking discovery, Durant is eligible for GIMPS\u2019s research discovery award of $3,000. He plans to donate this prize money to a public high school, hoping to inspire future generations in mathematics. \u201cI\u2019m glad to have a result that can help show a little bit about a special place in the South,\u201d he expressed.\n\nMUST READ | Is China Set To Outpace the U.S. In Mars Sample Returns?"

        "article_content": "Hidden deep in the frosty expanse of the Greenland Ice Sheet, an intriguing secret has been lurking \u2013 a significant amount of meltwater temporarily held within its icy mantle during the summertime.\n\nIt\u2019s a discovery that not only challenges our existing understanding of ice sheets and their role in sea-level rise but also signals the need for a paradigm shift in climate change models.\n\nA mystery on the Greenland ice sheet\n\nDespite being the largest single contributor to global sea-level rise, scientists have so far been unable to answer how the storage of meltwater within the Greenland Ice Sheet evolves throughout the summer melt season.\n\nHowever, a unique approach has now offered significant insight into the movement and storage of this meltwater. The research was led by Jiangjun Ran, a professor in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the Southern University of Science and Technology in China.\n\n\u201cDuring the melt season, we found that a significant fraction of meltwater mass is stored temporarily within the ice sheet. This water buffering effect peaks in July and slowly recedes in the following weeks,\u201d noted Professor Ran.\n\nWater dynamics within the ice sheet\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how water is stored and released within the ice sheet has always been a challenge,\u201d said Pavel Ditmar, a scientist in the Department of Geoscience and Remote Sensing at Delft University of Technology.\n\nTo overcome this, the team turned to data from the Greenland GPS Network (GNET). The network consists of tens of stations around Greenland, providing continuous positioning data.\n\nThe data was used to develop a method capable of interpreting the detected vertical displacements of the bedrock caused, among other things, by the mass of melting water.\n\nReshaping climate models\n\nThis discovery could revolutionize climate models, which often fail to capture the intricacy of water storage within ice sheets.\n\nEspecially in warmer years, these models may underestimate the process of water runoff towards the ocean.\n\nThe researchers found that the predictions could require scaling adjustments of up to 20% for the warmest years.\n\n\u201cThese findings are crucial for improving forecasts of the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s contribution to future sea-level rise,\u201d said Michiel van den Broeke, a scholar from Utrecht University.\n\n\u201cWith climate change making the Arctic warmer than ever, accurate predictions are essential for preparing coastal regions for potential sea-level rise.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding ice sheet dynamics\n\nThis significant breakthrough in understanding the behavior of polar ice wasn\u2019t an overnight success. It required years of meticulous preparation and arduous expeditions to remote corners of the planet.\n\nShfaqat Abbas Khan, a scholar from the Technical University of Denmark noted: \u201cThe work we\u2019ve done not only improves our understanding of ice sheet dynamics but also opens the door to new measurement techniques and campaigns.\u201d\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the discovery highlights the importance of international collaboration in confronting our shared environmental challenges, as we continue our journey to protect the delicate balance of life on this planet.\n\nClimate insights from Greenland\u2019s ice sheet\n\nThe impact of these new findings extends beyond Greenland\u2019s icy borders. If similar meltwater storage mechanisms exist in other ice-covered regions, such as Antarctica or the Himalayas, climate models may need further adjustments.\n\nBy factoring in these complex water storage processes, scientists can refine global sea-level rise predictions and provide more accurate timelines.\n\nThis broader understanding can help nations better prepare for climate impacts on coastal communities and freshwater supplies, highlighting the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s role in shaping the global climate.\n\nThis breakthrough would not have been possible without advancements in technology.\n\nTools like the Greenland GPS Network (GNET) have revolutionized the way scientists gather data, providing real-time insights into changes deep within the ice.\n\nThe use of these advanced techniques, from GPS-based monitoring to satellite imagery, is paving the way for further discoveries in polar research.\n\nWith these tools, researchers hope to continue uncovering Greenland\u2019s secrets and apply these findings to other remote and difficult-to-study ice sheets, accelerating the pace of climate science.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Nature.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nThe 47-year-old Voyager 1 spacecraft is back in touch with NASA \u2014 but not out of the woods \u2014 after a technical issue caused a days-long communications blackout with the historic mission, which is billions of miles away in interstellar space.\n\nVoyager 1 is now using a radio transmitter it hasn\u2019t relied on since 1981 to stay in contact with its team on Earth while engineers work to understand what went wrong.\n\nAs the spacecraft, launched in September 1977, ages, the team has slowly turned off components to conserve power, allowing Voyager 1 to send back unique science data from 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) away.\n\nThe probe is the farthest spacecraft from Earth, operating beyond the heliosphere \u2014 the sun\u2019s bubble of magnetic fields and particles that extends well beyond Pluto\u2019s orbit \u2014 where its instruments directly sample interstellar space.\n\nThe new issue is one of several the aging vehicle has faced in recent months, but Voyager\u2019s team keeps finding creative solutions so the storied explorer can zoom along on its cosmic journey through uncharted territory.\n\nNASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft is depicted in this artist's concept traveling through interstellar space, or the space between stars, which it entered in 2012. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nA radio glitch billions of miles away\n\nOccasionally, engineers send commands to Voyager 1 to turn on some of its heaters and warm components that have sustained radiation damage over the decades, said Bruce Waggoner, the Voyager mission assurance manager. The heat can help reverse the radiation damage, which degrades the performance of the spacecraft\u2019s components, he said.\n\nMessages are relayed to Voyager from mission control at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, through the agency\u2019s Deep Space Network. The system of radio antennas on Earth helps the agency communicate with Voyager 1 and its twin probe, Voyager 2, as well as other spacecraft exploring our solar system.\n\nVoyager 1 then sends back engineering data to show how it is responding to the commands. It takes about 23 hours for a message to travel one way.\n\nBut when a command to the heater was sent on October 16, something triggered the spacecraft\u2019s autonomous fault protection system. If the spacecraft draws more power than it should, the fault protection system automatically shuts off systems that aren\u2019t essential to conserve power.\n\nThe team discovered the latest issue when it couldn\u2019t detect the spacecraft\u2019s response signal through the Deep Space Network on October 18.\n\nVoyager 1 has been using one of its two radio transmitters, called an X-band based on the frequency it utilizes, for decades. Meanwhile, the other transmitter, called the S-band, which uses a different frequency, hasn\u2019t been employed since 1981 because its signal is much fainter than the X-band\u2019s.\n\nEngineers suspect the fault protection system lowered the rate at which data was being sent back from the transmitter, which changed the nature of the signal shared by Voyager 1 to the Deep Space Network monitors. The Voyager 1 team ultimately located the probe\u2019s response later on October 18 by sifting through signals the Deep Space Network was receiving.\n\nBut on October 19, communication with Voyager 1 appeared to stop completely.\n\nThe team believes the fault protection system was additionally triggered two more times, which may have switched off the X-band transmitter and shifted the spacecraft to the S-band transmitter that uses less power, NASA said.\n\nWorking on a solution\n\nWhile Voyager 1\u2019s team wasn\u2019t sure that the faint S-band signal would be detectable due to the spacecraft\u2019s distance from Earth, Deep Space Network engineers located it.\n\nThe team won\u2019t send commands to Voyager 1 to turn on the X-band transmitter again until it deduces what triggered the fault protection system, which could take weeks. Engineers are being cautious because they want to determine whether there are any potential risks to turning on the X-band.\n\nIf the team can get the X-band transmitter working again, the device may be able to relay data that could reveal what happened, Waggoner said.\n\nIn the meantime, engineers sent a message to Voyager 1 on October 22 to check that the S-band transmitter was working and received confirmation on October 24. But it\u2019s not a fix the team wants to rely on for too long.\n\n\u201cThe S-band signal is too weak to use long term,\u201d Waggoner said. \u201cSo far, the team has not been able to use it to get telemetry (information about the health and status of the spacecraft), let alone science data. But it allows us to at least send commands and make sure the spacecraft is still pointed at Earth.\u201d\n\nThis transmitter switch is just one of several innovative hacks NASA has used to overcome communication challenges with the long-lived mission this year, including firing up old thrusters to keep Voyager 1\u2019s antenna pointed at Earth and coming up with a solution for a computer glitch that silenced the probe\u2019s stream of science data to Earth for months."
