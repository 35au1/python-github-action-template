            "article_content": "Since its very inception, science fiction has maintained a tight hold over the imagination of its principal audience, achieving mainstream appeal with the advent of television. Like literature or film, the best-written sci-fi television transports viewers to exciting new locations, forcing them to look at the uncomfortable reality behind such issues as deep-space exploration, interplanetary colonization, or new technological innovations.\n\nAs with any genre, sci-fi requires a basis in stellar writing, with the best-written sci-fi series continuing to win acclaim years, sometimes decades after the show itself has aired on television.\n\n1. The Twilight Zone (1959-1964)\n\nImage Credit: CBS.\n\nOften imitated yet never duplicated, The Twilight Zone remains among the best-written sci-fi television programs for good reason. With stories spanning science fiction, horror, and fantasy, creator Rod Serling used The Twilight Zone to ask fundamental questions about life in the mid-20th century, creating intricate allegories for the Cold War, racism, human suffering, and the dangers that lurk behind mankind\u2019s fascination with the stars.\n\n2. Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009)\n\nImage Credit: NBC Universal Television Studio.\n\nReviving the middling \u201870s space opera Battlestar Galactica for a new generation, showrunner Ronald D. Moore rebuilt the series from the ground up. A stylistic departure from the kitschier presentation of most space opera series, Moore utilized a grittier, more realistic tone for 2004\u2019s Battlestar Galactica, allowing the show to achieve a sense of true weightiness and inherent drama. It ranks as some of the best-written sci-fi of the 21st century in any medium.\n\n3. Star Trek: The Original Series (1966-1969)\n\nImage Credit: Desilu Productions.\n\nIn no uncertain terms, Gene Roddenberry created the modern space opera with his work on Star Trek: The Original Series. Combining the comic book aesthetic of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon with the drier tone of 19th-century adventure fiction, Roddenberry constructed a complex sci-fi universe more expansive than any other of its day and age.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, Roddenberry not only spawned one of the most successful sci-fi series of all time\u2013he also popularized a genre that gained further traction with the release of 2001, Star Wars, and Alien in the decade that followed.\n\n4. The X-Files (1993-2018)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Fox Television.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA forward-thinking television series, The X-Files zeroed in on the concept of a police procedural series with a \u201cmystery of the week\u201d theme behind it, replacing murdering fugitives and serial killers with U.F.O.s, government conspiracies, and paranormal monsters from folklore. What followed helped revitalize televised science fiction for mass viewership, achieving the same level of avid popularity as The Twilight Zone.\n\n5. The Prisoner (1967-1968)\n\nImage Credit: Everyman Films and ITC Entertainment.\n\nA key narrative influence on everything from Lost to Twin Peaks, The Prisoner also offered a sharp rebuke of the traditional espionage genre. Incorporating numerous themes taken from James Bond, The Prisoner\u2019s subliminal messages and surreal presentation allowed for a thought-provoking Orwellian portrayal of conformity, individuality, and the precedence of Cold War hostilities.\n\n6. Stranger Things (2016-Present)\n\nImage Credit: 21 Laps Entertainment.\n\nOne of the best-written sci-fi shows of the modern era, Stranger Things also appears among Netflix's flagship series, helping give the streaming platform a vital foothold in premium content on par with HBO. An endearing love letter to all things \u201880s, Stranger Things strings together every cliche and pre-existing convention of dated pop culture, including meticulous references to early Spielberg films, kitschy slashers, Dungeons & Dragons, Stephen King novels, and Bronze Age comic books.\n\n7. Severance (2022-Present)\n\nImage Credit: Red Hour Productions.\n\nA show that reflects the darker aspect of corporate sci-fi (a niche but fascinating subgenre in itself), Severance also offers a poignant depiction of unscrupulous business practices. Exploring the differences in individuals\u2019 personal lives and workplace personalities, Severance asks all the right questions regarding contemporary capitalist society.\n\n8. Lost (2004-2010)\n\nImage Credit: Bad Robot and ABC Studios.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile viewers continue to lament its somewhat disappointing finale, most television scholars still credit Lost as one of the greatest TV shows of the 21st century. Borrowing the comic book presentation of Alan Moore\u2019s Watchmen, Lost\u2019s split narratives and shifting protagonists allowed for an in-depth study of numerous characters\u2019 backstories.\n\nAside from its fascinating episode structures, the show also boasted an unending array of unforgettable mysteries, several of which centered around sentient pillars of black smoke, \u201870s fringe scientists, and a Biblical duel between good and evil.\n\n9. Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-1994)\n\nImage Credit: Paramount Domestic Television.\n\nThe best of the Star Trek spin-off series, The Next Generation, harked back to The Original Series\u2019 dialogue-heavy tone. Introducing a cast of new characters every bit as endearing and three-dimensional as Kirk or Spock, The Next Generation\u2019s preference for strong characterization over stylized spaceship dog fights gave Trekkies a chance to bask in everything that made Star Trek so remarkable in the first place.\n\n10. Rick and Morty (2013-Present)\n\nImage Credit: Adult Swim.\n\nYes, one can describe Rick and Morty as a biting satire of Back to the Future and Doctor Who. Yet with each new season, Rick and Morty leans further into its own distinct brand of storytelling, alternating back-and-forth between meta-fictional sci-fi adventures and heartrending meditations on loneliness, substance abuse, and existential dread over one\u2019s place in the cosmos.\n\n11. Firefly (2002)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Century Fox Television.\n\nWhile Firefly\u2019s abrupt cancellation after the release of its single season left most industry experts perplexed, viewers can always look at the series\u2019 persevering cult status as evidence of Firefly\u2019s superior quality. A rare mainstream space Western that featured as many easter eggs to Bonanza and Gunsmoke as it did to Star Wars or Star Trek, Firefly made a habit of providing vivid characterization to its lead cast.\n\n12. Doctor Who (1963-Present)\n\nImage Credit: BBC.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost viewers can expect to see a show as long-running as Doctor Who ebb and flow in popularity over time. While certain periods in the show\u2019s history fail to gauge viewers\u2019 interests, Doctor Who\u2019s prevailing inventiveness, whimsy, and distinct British charm continue to fascinate fans over six decades since its original release.\n\n13. Westworld (2016-2022)\n\nImage Credit: HBO.\n\nCanceled in the wake of declining viewership numbers and disappointing critical reviews, the initial season of Westworld remains one of the most successful television series to ever air on HBO. Taking Michael Crichton\u2019s \u201870s sci-fi film and flipping it on its head, the show\u2019s intelligent treatment of artificial intelligence, entertainment, and technological advancements left viewers awestruck in 2016, the series possessing all the complexity of Blade Runner, A.I: Artificial Intelligence, or Ex Machina.\n\n14. Fringe (2008-2013)\n\nImage Credit: Warner Bros. Television.\n\nTaking liberal inspiration from The Twilight Zone, Lost, and The X-Files, Fringe acted as the ideal sci-fi counterpart to the fantasy-based Supernatural, utilizing a similar \u201cmonster of the week\u201d-style presentation. Like all the best TV series, the show\u2019s self-contained mythological universe accounted for the main reason to tune in each week, with viewers delighting in its distinct portrayal of fringe science.\n\n15. Black Mirror (2011-Present)\n\nImage Credit: Netflix.\n\nThe 21st-century successor to The Twilight Zone, whereas Rod Serling used his series to probe into the fundamental worries of the 20th century, Black Mirror showrunner Charlie Brooker uses science fiction to explore new advancements in technology and culture.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile the series\u2019 writing quality has fluctuated over time, the best episodes of Black Mirror continue to challenge viewers, presenting them with an upsetting speculative portrait of what the very near future might look like.\n\n16. The Expanse (2015-2022)\n\nImage Credit: Penguin in a Parka, SeanDanielCo, Alcon Television Group, Just So, & Amazon Studios.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe best space opera series since Battlestar Galactica, The Expanse\u2019s detailed portrait of a colonized galaxy on the brink of war achieves the same realistic tone as Ronald D. Moore\u2019s landmark series. Spending a significant portion of time on the political turmoil that foreshadows full-scale wars, The Expanse\u2019s intelligent and even-handed depiction of science fiction makes it one of the greatest television series of the past decade.\n\n17. Orphan Black (2013-2017)\n\nImage Credit: Temple Street Productions.\n\nIf Westworld offered a nuanced look at the arguments surrounding self-aware artificial intelligence, Orphan Black raised those same arguments for the implications of human cloning. A wondrous look at individuality and personality, Orphan Black\u2019s thematic discussions helped the series transcend the limits of science fiction, engaging viewers from an emotional and intellectual perspective.\n\n18. The Outer Limits (1963)\n\nImage Credit: United Artists Television.\n\nThe main thematic rival to The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits offered viewers a more dedicated depiction of science fiction than Rod Serling\u2019s program. Employing a wide array of talented sci-fi writers like Harlan Ellison, The Outer Limits\u2019 nightmarish presentation of the genre exploited the prevalent fears most Americans felt at the time, including imminent invasion and nuclear annihilation.\n\n19. Futurama (1999-Present)\n\nImage Credit: 20th Television.\n\nCanceled, rebooted, and then revived once again, Futurama\u2019s multiple resurrections over the years speak volumes about fans\u2019 favorable stance towards the show.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSpawning his own fully-rendered sci-fi universe, Simpsons creator Matt Groening conjured up a hilarious galaxy filled with colorful characters and exotic settings, from alcoholic robots to anxiety-riddled lobster physicians.\n\n20. Stargate SG-1 (1997-2007)\n\nImage Credit: MGM Television, Double Secret Productions, Gekko Film Corp., Sony Pictures Television, Showtime Networks, and Sci-Fi Originals.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA significant improvement over the 1994 sci-fi film of the same name, Stargate SG-1 never rivaled the storytelling prestige of Battlestar Galactica or Star Trek. Yet even when compared to those aforementioned sci-fi giants, Stargate SG-1\u2032s intelligent handling of intergalactic conflict and its implementation of Egyptian, Arthurian, and Greek mythology make it a dazzling space opera in and of itself."

            "article_content": "Nature\u2019s connections can show up in the most unassuming places. For decades, people have watched curiously as ants collect seeds. These seeds often come with a fatty attachment that entices ants to take them underground, which is a nifty tactic employed by plants to get their seeds dispersed.\n\nThis strategy, known as myrmecochory, has guided ecological thinking for many years. Recent observations have shaken up this old concept, as a surprising twist has come from an unlikely source: oak galls produced by certain wasps.\n\nAnts and wasps\n\nEight-year-old Hugo noticed something puzzling one afternoon. He saw a small parade of ants scurrying across a path, hauling what he assumed were regular seeds.\n\nHis father, named Andrew Deans, took a closer look and realized these were oak galls, not plant seeds.\n\nGalls are growths shaped by wasps to ensure a safe shelter in which their larvae can develop. Hugo\u2019s discovery launched fresh inquiries into how wasps might be tricking ants into unwittingly providing protection and resources for their developing young.\n\nAndrew Deans is a professor of entomology at Penn State. His experiences with insect classification and ecology helped shape the next steps in understanding how certain wasps manipulate ant behavior.\n\nWorking with other researchers, he looked at the structure and chemical makeup of the oak galls, aiming to see whether these odd lumps mimic the enticing attachments found on seeds.\n\nThat line of inquiry opened the door to a bigger story about insect collaboration.\n\nThe lure of fatty acids\n\nResearch into seed dispersal has shown that ants love fatty acids, which they harvest from specialized structures on seeds.\n\nMany oak galls have a similar coating, sometimes called a hood, that contains these appealing molecules.\n\nOnce ants bring the gall inside their nest, they devour the fatty portion but leave the rest. Within that intact shell, the wasp larvae stay hidden from predators.\n\nThe parallels between seeds and galls have stirred fresh debate among entomologists.\n\nChemical camouflage\n\nThe biggest revelation for many scientists is that these gall hoods may imitate the scent of deceased insects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how these structures mimic the chemical profile of dead insects, one of the main food sources for ants,\u201d said John Tooker, professor of entomology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThis discovery sheds light on a possible reason behind the ants\u2019 brisk retrieval of galls. They are likely to think they have found a reliable meal, but end up giving wasp larvae a free ride and shelter instead.\n\nAnts, wasps, and evolution\n\nMillions of years before humans paid attention to them, galls were a feature on oak trees. Fossil records show that wasps and oaks have had a long relationship, although it is not clear when ants became part of the mix.\n\nSome experts propose that wasps first persuaded oaks to create galls and then evolved ways to draw ants into the equation. Others believe the ants\u2019 interest in fatty acids nudged the wasps toward this chemical strategy.\n\nNature relies on countless overlapping interactions. These gall-making wasps provide another example of how two different insects might develop a shared connection that benefits one party more than the other.\n\nWhile ants enjoy a quick snack from the gall\u2019s fatty hood, the wasp larvae receive a safe refuge for their development.\n\nThis unintentional partnership hints at how life weaves complex networks that bind different species together, often in ways that scientists have missed. Each time new details emerge, the broader narrative of ecological ties evolves.\n\nA nudge toward conservation\n\n\u201cThis should make us think about how much we still don\u2019t know about ecosystems and the need to preserve biodiversity,\u201d reflected Andrew Deans.\n\nThe researchers stressed the importance of keeping ecosystems intact to maintain these intricate ties.\n\nOak trees, and the wasps that make use of them, face threats from habitat decline and changing climates, which could unsettle the entire chain of relationships.\n\nWhen environments shift, the ants, the galls, and the plants lose a vital piece of the puzzle that supports their survival.\n\nWhere curiosity leads\n\nHugo\u2019s brief observation highlights how small moments can spark big changes in what we know. Nobody expected a child\u2019s quiet stroll to upend familiar ideas. Researchers are now curious to see if other insects use similar methods to coerce ants.\n\nBy peering into everyday wonders, people can gain a deeper appreciation of how species interact. Each fresh insight builds on the last, emphasizing the value of patient exploration and open minds in science.\n\nThe research findings were published in The American Naturalist.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "There's some positive news in advanced battery science thanks to hydrogen ions, or protons.\n\nThese positively charged particles can work inside a power pack to carry energy, similar to lithium ions but sans the expensive supply chain and invasive mining needed to gather the metal, according to a lab report from Australia's UNSW Sydney.\n\nA linchpin to the invention is the development of an organic anode material called tetraamino-benzoquinone, or TABQ, which can store the protons.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen batteries operate, ions move between the anode and cathode through a substance called electrolyte.\n\n\"Using this material, we successfully built an all-organic proton battery that is effective at both room temperature and sub-zero freezing temperatures,\" professor Chuan Zhao said.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are effective and cleaner than dirty fuels. When powering an electric vehicle, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported that the rides are cleaner during their lifespans than gas cars, even when considering the costly and dirty supply chain for the hard-to-gather power pack parts.\n\nBut alternatives, from potassium to salt, sometimes have cheaper, safer, and even better-performing potential in greater temperature ranges.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing hydrogen ions is among the latest innovations from an expert lab. The UNSW Sydney team touted its tech as addressing fast charge and even safety concerns; lithium-ion packs are susceptible to rare yet serious fire risks.\n\n\"To enhance the usage of renewable energies, we have to develop some more efficient energy integration technologies and our proton battery design is a promising trial,\" doctoral candidate Sicheng Wu, who helped to develop TABQ, said.\n\nShould the U.S. invest more in battery innovations?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nTABQ was found in testing to support \"rapid proton movement using hydrogen-bond networks.\" The motion bodes well for energy density, or storage capacity per pound, as well as power output.\n\nThe anode research started with tetrachloro-benzoquinone, or TCBQ, according to the experts. The team modified some of its chemistry to create the useful TABQ anode. They combined it with a TCBQ cathode, garnering great results. The battery is reported to be able to last for 3,500 charge-discharge cycles and is well-suited for renewable energy storage, per the experts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cost savings are set to be realized as the concept is commercialized.\n\n\"If you just look at the TABQ material that we have designed, it's not necessarily cheap to produce at the moment,\" Zhao said. \"But because it's made of abundant light elements, it will be easy and affordable to eventually scale up.\"\n\nStoring intermittent energy from the sun, wind, and waves is necessary to transition to a cleaner power system, a switch already well underway. In the United States, renewables generate more than 20% of electricity, according to the government.

            "article_content": "OpenAI has cut off a developer who built a device that could respond to ChatGPT queries to aim and fire an automated rifle. The device went viral after a video on Reddit showed its developer reading firing commands aloud, after which a rifle beside him quickly began aiming and firing at nearby walls.\n\n\u201cChatGPT, we\u2019re under attack from the front left and front right,\u201d the developer told the system in the video. \u201cRespond accordingly.\u201d The speed and accuracy which with the rifle responds is impressive, relying on OpenAI\u2019s Realtime API to interpret input and then return directions the contraption can understand. It would only require some simple training for ChatGPT to receive a command such as \u201cturn left\u201d and understand how to translate that into a machine-readable language.\n\nIn a statement to Futurism, OpenAI said it had viewed the video and shut down the developer behind it. \u201cWe proactively identified this violation of our policies and notified the developer to cease this activity ahead of receiving your inquiry,\u201d the company told the outlet.\n\nThe potential to automate lethal weapons is one fear that critics have raised about AI technology like that developed by OpenAI. The company\u2019s multi-modal models are capable of interpreting audio and visual inputs to understand a person\u2019s surroundings and respond to queries about what they are seeing. Autonomous drones are already being developed that could be used on the battlefield to identify and strike targets without a human\u2019s input. That is, of course, a war crime, and risks humans becoming complacent, allowing an AI to make decisions and making it tough to hold anyone accountable.\n\nThe concern does not appear to be theoretical either. A recent report from the Washington Post found that Israel has already used AI to select bombing targets, sometimes indiscriminately. \u201cSoldiers who were poorly trained in using the technology attacked human targets without corroborating Lavender\u2019s predictions at all\u201d the story reads, referring to a piece of AI software. \u201cAt certain times the only corroboration required was that the target was a male.\u201d\n\nProponents of AI on the battlefield say it will make soldiers safer by allowing them to stay away from the frontlines and neutralize targets, like missile stockpiles, or conduct reconnaissance from a distance. And AI-powered drones could strike with precision. But that depends on how they are used. Critics say the U.S. should get better at jamming enemy communications systems instead, so adversaries like Russia have a harder time launching their own drones or nukes.\n\nOpenAI prohibits the use of its products to develop or use weapons, or to \u201cautomate certain systems that can affect personal safety.\u201d But the company last year announced a partnership with defense-tech company Anduril, a maker of AI-powered drones and missiles, to create systems that can defend against drone attacks. The company says it will \u201crapidly synthesize time-sensitive data, reduce the burden on human operators, and improve situational awareness.\u201d\n\nIt is not hard to understand why tech companies are interested in moving into warfare. The U.S. spends nearly a trillion dollars annually on defense, and it remains an unpopular idea to cut that spending. With President-elect Trump filling his cabinet with conservative-leaning tech figures like Elon Musk and David Sacks, a whole slew of defense tech players are expected to benefit greatly and potentially supplant existing defense companies like Lockheed Martin.\n\nAlthough OpenAI is blocking its own customers from using its AI to build weapons, there exists a whole host of open-source models that could be employed for the same use. Add on top of that the ability to 3D print weapons parts\u2014which is what law enforcement believes was done by alleged UnitedHealthcare shooter Luigi Mangione\u2014and it is becoming shockingly easy to build DIY autonomous killing machines from the comfort of ones home."

            "article_content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose company developed ChatGPT and thus brought artificial intelligence into countless households and businesses around the world, is being accused by his younger sister of childhood sexual abuse at their family home in Clayton, Missouri.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed Monday with the U.S. Eastern District Court of Missouri, Ann Altman said the alleged \u201cacts of rape, sexual assault, sexual abuse, molestation, sodomy, and battery\u201d began around 1997 when she was 3 years old and continued for nine years.\n\nSam Altman, who was 12 when the alleged abuse began, denied any wrongdoing Tuesday in a joint statement on X alongside his mother, Connie, and two brothers, Max and Jack \u2014 who attributed Ann Altman\u2019s claims to \u201cmental health challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of these claims are utterly untrue,\u201d they wrote in the shared statement. \u201cThis situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refuses conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe family added that they\u2019ve tried to \u201chelp her find stability\u201d over the years \u201cwithout enabling harmful behaviors,\u201d but they claimed that despite their monthly financial support and help finding employment, Ann Altman, 30, \u201ccontinues to demand more money from us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe worst allegation she has made is that she was sexually abused by Sam as a child,\u201d the family wrote Tuesday, adding: \u201cHer claims have evolved drastically over time. Newly for this lawsuit, they now include allegations of incidents where Sam was over 18.\u201d\n\nAnn Altman\u2019s suit cited Missouri\u2019s Childhood Sexual Abuse law in claiming he committed his \u201clast acts of rape\u201d as an adult in 2006 when she was still a minor. She alleges the abuse began when they were both kids, and she was \u201cforced to touch his penis and perform oral penetration.\u201d\n\nSam Altman denied wrongdoing in a statement Tuesday alongside his mother and brothers. Markus Schreiber/Associated Press\n\nAnn Altman further alleged her brother started penetrating her \u201cwith his penis both vaginally and anally\u201d around 1999 or 2000. Her family claimed Tuesday they initially hoped to resolve this matter privately.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHowever, she has now taken legal action against Sam, and we feel we have no choice but to address this,\u201d they wrote, claiming she previously accused family members of \u201chacking her wifi, and \u2018shadowbanning\u2019 her from various websites including ChatGPT\u201d and X.\n\nAnn Altman\u2019s attorney, Ryan Mahoney, told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that his client has endured trauma but that \u201cthere is no evidence that her own mental health has contributed to her allegations.\u201d\n\nSam Altman was ousted as CEO in November, but three days later, after a series of negotiations, OpenAI reinstated him.\n\nNeed help?

            "article_content": "Open-source software is common throughout the tech world, and tools like software composition analysis can spot dependencies and secure them. However, working with open source presents security challenges compared with proprietary software.\n\nChris Hughes, chief security advisor at open-source software security startup Endor Labs, spoke to TechRepublic about the state of open-source software security today and where it might go in the next year.\n\n\u201cOrganizations are starting to try to get some foundational things like governance in place to understand what we are using in terms of open source,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWhere does it reside in our enterprise? What applications are running it?\u201d\n\nOpen source security trends for 2025\n\nFor his work, Hughes defined open source as software for which source code is freely available and can be used to build other projects, possibly with some restrictions. Last year, Harvard Business School found organizations would need to invest $8.8 trillion in technology and labor time to recreate the software used in business if open-source software wasn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cThe estimates are 70-90% of all applications have open source, and roughly 90% of those code bases are entirely made up of open source,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nFor 2025, Hughes predicts:\n\nWidespread open-source software adoption will be accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks on OSS by malicious actors.\n\nOrganizations will continue to put foundational OSS governance in place.\n\nMore companies will use open-source and commercial tools to help them start to understand their OSS consumption.\n\nOrganizations will perform risk-informed consumption of OSS.\n\nEnterprises will continue to push for vendor transparency regarding what OSS they use in their products. However, no widespread mandates will arise for this process.\n\nAI will continue to impact application security and open source in various ways, including organizations using AI to analyze code and remediate issues.\n\nAttackers will target widely used OSS AI libraries, projects, models, and more to launch supply chain attacks on the OSS AI community and commercial vendors.\n\nAI code governance, where organizations have more visibility into AI models, will become more common.\n\nOrganizations increasingly want to know how secure their open source software is, including \u201chow well is it maintained, who\u2019s maintaining it and how quickly do they address vulnerabilities when they occur,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nHe highlighted the attack in April 2024 in which a string of social engineering attempts threatened open-source utilities, particularly opening a backdoor in the XZ Utils utility.\n\n\u201cThat one was really kind of sinister because the open source ecosystem is largely sustained by unpaid volunteers, folks doing this in their free time \u2026 and often not compensated, unpaid, etc.,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo, taking advantage of that and preying on that was a pretty nefarious thing that got a lot of people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nHow is AI changing open-source security?\n\nIn October 2024, the Open Source Initiative established a definition for open-source AI. According to the initiative, open-source AI has four key elements: the freedom to use, study, modify, and share the system for any purpose.\n\nHughes said that defining open-source AI was important because of the rise of distribution platforms like Hugging Face.\n\n\u201cThese AI models, especially the open source ones, are widely used by many organizations and individuals around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to asking: What exactly is in this, and who contributed to it, and where is it from? And are there vulnerable components?\u201d\n\nHughes said that large corporations may have a better chance of talking transparently with their vendors about the entirety of their software supply chain than small companies. Therefore, the problem of not having visibility into the AI models used in their software can grow exponentially for smaller companies.\n\nSEE: Smart home device makers will soon be able to apply for a U.S. government seal of security approval.\n\nCISA encourages open-source software development security\n\nIn March 2024, CISA finalized the secure software development self-attestation form, meant for developers of software used by the U.S. federal government to confirm they use secure development practices.\n\nFederal agencies may ask for other forms and attestations as well. On the commercial side, organizations may build similar requirements into their procurement processes. There is still an element of trust involved since the organization needs to trust the vendor will keep to their word. But the conversation is happening more often now than it did last year, in the wake of attacks on open source utilities, Hughes said.\n\nSolutions for the future of open source software security\n\nPerforming software composition analysis isn\u2019t enough going into 2025, Hughes said. IT professionals and security professionals should know that as software becomes more complex, the number of vulnerabilities has grown \u201cto where it\u2019s becoming a tax on developers to even navigate what needs to be fixed and what order of priority,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nCompanies like Endor Labs can provide insights on dependencies within open-source code, including indirect or transitive dependencies.\n\n\u201cBeing able to point to things like reachability and exploitability \u2026 could be a big benefit from the compliance perspective too, in terms of the burden on the organization and your development team,\u201d he said."

            "article_content": "Grain prices have gotten off to a positive start in 2025, continuing the vein of form they found in December.\n\nEuropean prices are seeing the main lift, while UK and US prices have seen some falls. US prices were positive this week.\n\nThe French wheat price for December 2025 was at \u20ac233.75/t on Wednesday afternoon this week. It was relatively steady since the end of last week.\n\nOn 20 December, that price was at \u20ac226.75/t. It increased to \u20ac230.25/t on 27 December and on 3 January moved to \u20ac232.75/t.\n\nThe Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) in the UK is not predicting any big move in prices in the coming months.\n\nCommenting on wheat prices this week, it said: \u201cUnfavourable weather in the US and Russia, plus maize concerns in Argentina, offer support to prices short term.\n\n\u201cBut harvest pressures in the southern hemisphere may limit longer-term price gains.\u201d\n\nMaize prices have remained up in Europe and have gone back up in the US.\n\nHigh maize prices are generally a good thing for grain prices in Ireland, as maize becomes less attractive in animal feed if it is more expensive than wheat or barley.\n\nThere are concerns about the maize crop in Argentina, but a large crop is expected from Brazil so this may offset losses.\n\nFeed barley prices in France had moved up over the Christmas period, but went back down this week to \u20ac202/t in some regions.\n\nThe FOB Creil price for spring malting barley is steady at \u20ac240/t. It looks like there is very little trading happening in that market at present.\n\nOilseed rape\n\nHigh oil prices may be helping rapeseed prices. However, a large soybean crop could affect the rapeseed price. However, hot and dry weather is reported to be damaging soy bean crops in Argentina.\n\nOn 20 December, the November French oilseed rape price was at \u20ac464/t.\n\nIt moved to \u20ac461/t on 27 December, but on 3 January had increased to \u20ac470/t. On Wednesday afternoon this week, it had moved up again to \u20ac477.25/t.\n\nNative prices\n\nAt home, prices have been rising slowly but steadily. In November spot barley was reported around \u20ac220/t to \u20ac225/t.\n\nIn December, it moved to \u20ac230/t and in early January it is now at \u20ac230/t to \u20ac235/t.\n\nSpot wheat is also reported to have increased to \u20ac245/t to \u20ac250/t. November prices are looking similar to these prices.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the AHDB reported a spot barley price of \u00a3201/t on 3 January and a forward price for February of \u00a3204/t. All of these prices are dried unless otherwise stated."

According to a new blog post, the software giant is laying out the next big 6 trends that will shape the industry and workplaces by using AI agents.\n\nAI is poised for its next major leap. Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024, with organizations achieving a return of $3.70 for every $1 invested. AI is expected to contribute $2.7 trillion to Europe\u2019s GDP by 2030, as adoption accelerates, and businesses unlock value in as little as 13 months.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s predictions are mostly based on the latest IDC study cited in another blog post from the Redmont giant.\n\nHere are the key AI trends for 2025 according to Microsoft\n\n1. More capable and useful AI models\n\nMicrosoft believes that the AI models will continue to evolve into more capable version that will help solve a lot of complex problems in all areas including science, healthcare and even law. Generating code, executing workflows efficiently and comparing contracts will become the advanced tasks for the AI agents that will push forward the organization\u2019s productivity.\n\n2. The AI bots will redefine the work\n\nAn obvious prediction for AI agents is that they will take on the repetitive tasks that we don\u2019t want to deal with anymore. Microsoft mentions IT troubleshooting and workflow optimization, along with building workflows and writing code for developers that will only need to provide final touches to it. That makes a lot of sense, and we can already see a development in all those areas.\n\n3. AI agents will become our everyday companions\n\nAs you might have thought, Microsoft thinks that Copilot and its features such as Vision will become your new close buddy, providing all the information you need. Moreover, the bot will also discuss with you and disseminate the information to make things a lot more engaging and comprehensible.\n\nWhile we can see this going on in the future, probably 2025 is not the year this will suddenly happening. According to a Business of apps usage statistics, about 300 million people used AI apps in 2024. That includes all AI apps, not just Copilot.\n\nAccording to the same study, in October 2024, Copilot had 28 million active users and in September, the AI bot had 37 million visits. Those are hardly numbers to brag when we\u2019re talking about a solution becoming mainstream. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that Copilot can\u2019t be your friend if you want to, but we can\u2019t talk about AI agents starting to be every day companions.\n\n4. AI development will become more sustainable\n\nRight now, AI models use a lot of power and water to cool down those servers and the next major prediction is that the AI business will become more sustainable.\n\nMicrosoft is advancing green AI, building data centers that use zero water for cooling and operate on carbon-free energy sources like wind, geothermal, nuclear, and solar power. By 2030, Microsoft aims to be a carbon-negative, water-positive, and zero-waste company.\n\nThe only scary thing in the Microsoft rhetoric is nuclear, mentioned as a carbon-free energy source. Knowing the basics about this power source from the 80\u2019s, although being efficient, the nuclear powerplants still generate a disturbing amount of waste that we didn\u2019t yet learn how to dispose of properly.\n\n5. AI will be better kept in check\n\nThe most important problem right now with AI is that it doesn\u2019t really have any serious guardrails. Microsoft is seeing a change in 2025 for that aspect and it\u2019s testing how to address AI inaccuracies and limit the potential destructive power of AI being used irresponsibly.\n\nAlthough Microsoft is taking that task upon themselves, there are AI bots out there that can be customized in any aspect possible, providing means for wrongdoers to perform cyberattacks and other destructive actions.\n\n6. AI models will lead to scientific breakthroughs\n\nWith AI being very effective in performing a lot of calculations, it\u2019s reasonable to think that the computational models already have an impact in science discoveries. Microsoft\u2019s point is that along with improved models new innovations in research will also follow. They mention climate change study and public health being the major domains for development.\n\nLastly, Microsoft envisions a new era between AI models and agents led by an improvement on how Ai models will be trained.\n\nWith Microsoft investing billions of dollars into AI, we will clearly see new advancements in AI models and research. Whether or not 2025 will mark a cornerstone for AI remains to be seen. However, users don\u2019t seem so enthusiastic about using it so far. Actually, Copilot with its Windows Recall might be one of the reasons why Windows 10 users are not so keen in upgrading to Windows 11 just yet.\n\nWhat do you think about Microsoft\u2019s AI predictions for 2025?

The young bull kill reduced by 11,585 head \u2013 almost a 10% reduction on the 2023 number.\n\nThe bullock kill was back by almost 2% or 12,556 head to 681,377.\n\nThe cow kill took an unexpected lift in 2024 with nitrates issues forcing disposals on some farms, especially in the south of the country.\n\nThe continued decline in the suckler herd also drove numbers. The cow kill finished up 7% or almost up 30,000 head on the 2023 number.\n\nCalf slaughtering dropped by almost 10,000 head in 2024, down 32% on 2023 to just over 20,000 head in 2024.\n\nNumbers of cattle moving north for slaughter have dropped off in recent weeks. There were just over 26,000 cattle exported for direct slaughter in 2024, with the current price differential expected to drive numbers in 2025 as well.\n\nBeef quotes across the water continue to improve, with quotes up 10p to 15p/kg from before Christmas. Some large feeders have been able to get \u00a35.65/kg (\u20ac7.18/kg incl VAT) for in-spec stock this week, which is a big improvement on pre-Christmas quotes. A gap of over \u20ac1/kg remains between the English and Irish beef price.\n\nNI comment\n\nQuotes are on 516p/kg (\u20ac6.51/kg inc VAT) for U3 cattle, although 530p/kg (\u20ac6.69/kg) is widely available as a starting price with 4p to 10p/kg more on offer depending on numbers. Good-quality cows are on 420p to 450p/kg (\u20ac5.30 to \u20ac5.68/kg)."

            "article_content": "Nature\u2019s connections can show up in the most unassuming places. For decades, people have watched curiously as ants collect seeds. These seeds often come with a fatty attachment that entices ants to take them underground, which is a nifty tactic employed by plants to get their seeds dispersed.\n\nThis strategy, known as myrmecochory, has guided ecological thinking for many years. Recent observations have shaken up this old concept, as a surprising twist has come from an unlikely source: oak galls produced by certain wasps.\n\nAnts and wasps\n\nEight-year-old Hugo noticed something puzzling one afternoon. He saw a small parade of ants scurrying across a path, hauling what he assumed were regular seeds.\n\nHis father, named Andrew Deans, took a closer look and realized these were oak galls, not plant seeds.\n\nGalls are growths shaped by wasps to ensure a safe shelter in which their larvae can develop. Hugo\u2019s discovery launched fresh inquiries into how wasps might be tricking ants into unwittingly providing protection and resources for their developing young.\n\nAndrew Deans is a professor of entomology at Penn State. His experiences with insect classification and ecology helped shape the next steps in understanding how certain wasps manipulate ant behavior.\n\nWorking with other researchers, he looked at the structure and chemical makeup of the oak galls, aiming to see whether these odd lumps mimic the enticing attachments found on seeds.\n\nThat line of inquiry opened the door to a bigger story about insect collaboration.\n\nThe lure of fatty acids\n\nResearch into seed dispersal has shown that ants love fatty acids, which they harvest from specialized structures on seeds.\n\nMany oak galls have a similar coating, sometimes called a hood, that contains these appealing molecules.\n\nOnce ants bring the gall inside their nest, they devour the fatty portion but leave the rest. Within that intact shell, the wasp larvae stay hidden from predators.\n\nThe parallels between seeds and galls have stirred fresh debate among entomologists.\n\nChemical camouflage\n\nThe biggest revelation for many scientists is that these gall hoods may imitate the scent of deceased insects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how these structures mimic the chemical profile of dead insects, one of the main food sources for ants,\u201d said John Tooker, professor of entomology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThis discovery sheds light on a possible reason behind the ants\u2019 brisk retrieval of galls. They are likely to think they have found a reliable meal, but end up giving wasp larvae a free ride and shelter instead.\n\nAnts, wasps, and evolution\n\nMillions of years before humans paid attention to them, galls were a feature on oak trees. Fossil records show that wasps and oaks have had a long relationship, although it is not clear when ants became part of the mix.\n\nSome experts propose that wasps first persuaded oaks to create galls and then evolved ways to draw ants into the equation. Others believe the ants\u2019 interest in fatty acids nudged the wasps toward this chemical strategy.\n\nNature relies on countless overlapping interactions. These gall-making wasps provide another example of how two different insects might develop a shared connection that benefits one party more than the other.\n\nWhile ants enjoy a quick snack from the gall\u2019s fatty hood, the wasp larvae receive a safe refuge for their development.\n\nThis unintentional partnership hints at how life weaves complex networks that bind different species together, often in ways that scientists have missed. Each time new details emerge, the broader narrative of ecological ties evolves.\n\nA nudge toward conservation\n\n\u201cThis should make us think about how much we still don\u2019t know about ecosystems and the need to preserve biodiversity,\u201d reflected Andrew Deans.\n\nThe researchers stressed the importance of keeping ecosystems intact to maintain these intricate ties.\n\nOak trees, and the wasps that make use of them, face threats from habitat decline and changing climates, which could unsettle the entire chain of relationships.\n\nWhen environments shift, the ants, the galls, and the plants lose a vital piece of the puzzle that supports their survival.\n\nWhere curiosity leads\n\nHugo\u2019s brief observation highlights how small moments can spark big changes in what we know. Nobody expected a child\u2019s quiet stroll to upend familiar ideas. Researchers are now curious to see if other insects use similar methods to coerce ants.\n\nBy peering into everyday wonders, people can gain a deeper appreciation of how species interact. Each fresh insight builds on the last, emphasizing the value of patient exploration and open minds in science.\n\nThe research findings were published in The American Naturalist.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "source": "TechRepublic",
            "article_content": "Open-source software is common throughout the tech world, and tools like software composition analysis can spot dependencies and secure them. However, working with open source presents security challenges compared with proprietary software.\n\nChris Hughes, chief security advisor at open-source software security startup Endor Labs, spoke to TechRepublic about the state of open-source software security today and where it might go in the next year.\n\n\u201cOrganizations are starting to try to get some foundational things like governance in place to understand what we are using in terms of open source,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWhere does it reside in our enterprise? What applications are running it?\u201d\n\nOpen source security trends for 2025\n\nFor his work, Hughes defined open source as software for which source code is freely available and can be used to build other projects, possibly with some restrictions. Last year, Harvard Business School found organizations would need to invest $8.8 trillion in technology and labor time to recreate the software used in business if open-source software wasn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cThe estimates are 70-90% of all applications have open source, and roughly 90% of those code bases are entirely made up of open source,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nFor 2025, Hughes predicts:\n\nWidespread open-source software adoption will be accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks on OSS by malicious actors.\n\nOrganizations will continue to put foundational OSS governance in place.\n\nMore companies will use open-source and commercial tools to help them start to understand their OSS consumption.\n\nOrganizations will perform risk-informed consumption of OSS.\n\nEnterprises will continue to push for vendor transparency regarding what OSS they use in their products. However, no widespread mandates will arise for this process.\n\nAI will continue to impact application security and open source in various ways, including organizations using AI to analyze code and remediate issues.\n\nAttackers will target widely used OSS AI libraries, projects, models, and more to launch supply chain attacks on the OSS AI community and commercial vendors.\n\nAI code governance, where organizations have more visibility into AI models, will become more common.\n\nOrganizations increasingly want to know how secure their open source software is, including \u201chow well is it maintained, who\u2019s maintaining it and how quickly do they address vulnerabilities when they occur,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nHe highlighted the attack in April 2024 in which a string of social engineering attempts threatened open-source utilities, particularly opening a backdoor in the XZ Utils utility.\n\n\u201cThat one was really kind of sinister because the open source ecosystem is largely sustained by unpaid volunteers, folks doing this in their free time \u2026 and often not compensated, unpaid, etc.,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo, taking advantage of that and preying on that was a pretty nefarious thing that got a lot of people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nHow is AI changing open-source security?\n\nIn October 2024, the Open Source Initiative established a definition for open-source AI. According to the initiative, open-source AI has four key elements: the freedom to use, study, modify, and share the system for any purpose.\n\nHughes said that defining open-source AI was important because of the rise of distribution platforms like Hugging Face.\n\n\u201cThese AI models, especially the open source ones, are widely used by many organizations and individuals around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to asking: What exactly is in this, and who contributed to it, and where is it f\n\nrom? And are there vulnerable components?\u201d\n\nHughes said that large corporations may have a better chance of talking transparently with their vendors about the entirety of their software supply chain than small companies. Therefore, the problem of not having visibility into the AI models used in their software can grow exponentially for smaller companies.\n\nSEE: Smart home device makers will soon be able to apply for a U.S. government seal of security approval.\n\nCISA encourages open-source software development security\n\nIn March 2024, CISA finalized the secure software development self-attestation form, meant for developers of software used by the U.S. federal government to confirm they use secure development practices.\n\nFederal agencies may ask for other forms and attestations as well. On the commercial side, organizations may build similar requirements into their procurement processes. There is still an element of trust involved since the organization needs to trust the vendor will keep to their word. But the conversation is happening more often now than it did last year, in the wake of attacks on open source utilities, Hughes said.\n\nSolutions for the future of open source software security\n\nPerforming software composition analysis isn\u2019t enough going into 2025, Hughes said. IT professionals and security professionals should know that as software becomes more complex, the number of vulnerabilities has grown \u201cto where it\u2019s becoming a tax on developers to even navigate what needs to be fixed and what order of priority,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nCompanies like Endor Labs can provide insights on dependencies within open-source code, including indirect or transitive dependencies.\n\n\u201cBeing able to point to things like reachability and exploitability \u2026 could be a big benefit from the compliance perspective too, in terms of the burden on the organization and your development team,\u201d he said."

            "article_content": "Microsoft, the tech giant famous for innovation and its large workforce, has confirmed it will be reducing a small percentage of jobs in different departments based on performance.\n\nThis latest layoff is not a massive reduction but may signal a change in the strategy at Microsoft as it responds to the changing demands of the tech and AI competition.\n\nJob Cuts at Microsoft: The Details You Need to Know\n\nMicrosoft confirmed in a statement on Wednesday that less than 1% of its 228,000 employees will be affected by these latest job cuts. CNBC reports that sources familiar with the situation said layoffs are part of a broader performance evaluation strategy, aiming to optimize its workforce without major upheavals.\n\nFor context, this is the latest development in a round of layoffs coming after Microsoft's restructuring announcements. In early 2023, it made the news with a record layoff of 10,000 employees alongside office lease consolidation.\n\nWhen Microsoft post-acquired Activision Blizzard in January 2024, its gaming unit witnessed 1,900 job losses due to position overlap. Though the present layoff is small, they do draw attention in the context of Microsoft's overall performance.\n\nThe Bigger Picture: Microsoft's Market Performance\n\nWhile Microsoft continues to record great financial performance, the stock performance of the company in 2023 trailed its tech peers. Although a near-record net income margin of 38%, its highest since the early 2000s, Microsoft's stock only rose by 12% compared to 29% in the Nasdaq for the same period. It has triggered speculation on the company's future course and its potential to continue with growth in a competitive technology market.\n\nMicrosoft's Ties with OpenAI\n\nThe gargantuan rise of Microsoft's market cap last year was in significant part as a result of its relationship with the artificial intelligence start-up OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has invested over $13 billion into the firm and will now play a significant role in a new revolution in AI. At the close of 2024, there seems to be increasingly increasing tensions between the two.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella recently spoke on this \"cooperation tension\" in which he admitted OpenAI, an already formidable rival in its own right, had the potential to upset Microsoft's market position with its AI plays. The stakes are high and at a turning point for the company's AI strategy, considering the company's current role within the fast-moving AI sector.\n\nSlow Rollout of Microsoft 365 Copilot Worrisome to Investors?\n\nOne area of focus for Microsoft's future growth is its Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant, which leverages OpenAI's technology to integrate artificial intelligence into the company's productivity suite. However, early feedback suggests that the rollout of Copilot has been slower than expected.\n\nAnalysts from UBS recently noted that Microsoft's presentation at its Ignite conference in late 2023 left them with the impression that Copilot's adoption in the business world had been \"underwhelming.\"\n\nAs businesses increasingly look for AI-driven tools to improve productivity, Microsoft's ability to scale Copilot and similar offerings will be critical to its long-term success.\n\nThe company is under pressure to prove that its AI investments will yield substantial returns, particularly as it faces growing competition from other tech giants.\n\nHowever, despite the obstacles, Microsoft looks at the bright side of things. Its finance chief, Amy Hood, stressed that revenue growth in its Azure cloud services will increase in 2024 because of the rise in the expansion of AI infrastructure capacity.\n\nAzure's cloud platform is an integral part of Microsoft's long-term strategy, and it's setting up for the speedy expansion of AI and cloud-based services in the years ahead.\n\nWhile the recent job cuts may be seen as a short-term adjustment, Microsoft's focus on AI and cloud services indicates that it is preparing for a huge transformation in the tech landscape."

But the Pentagon knew it would never be able to get enough, as fewer nations made Russian heavy artillery ammunition and many Cold War stockpiles of them had become unusable with age.\n\nSo on a Saturday that spring, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III called Gen. Mark A. Milley, his chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, to figure out how many American howitzers could be quickly shipped to Ukraine along with newly made high-explosive shells.\n\nThat call set into motion a chain of events that led to a pipeline of arms for Ukraine, and a reshaping of how the United States envisions building alliances as it pushes back on Russia\u2019s influence."

            "article_content": "This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nOn Tuesday, after a ferocious Santa Ana windstorm blew through Southern California, a severe brush fire broke out in the wealthy Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, burning 1,000 structures and forcing tens of thousands of residents to evacuate as of Wednesday afternoon. Another large brush fire broke out near Pasadena around the same time, killing at least two people. Together the two blazes threatened some of the most valuable homes and businesses in the United States. The damage from the Palisades Fire alone could exceed $10 billion, according to a preliminary estimate from J.P. Morgan.\n\nIf this estimate holds true, it will test insurers\u2019 commitment to a market that has been teetering on the verge of collapse for the better part of a decade now. Over the past five years, California has become a poster child for what climate-fueled weather disasters can do to a state\u2019s home insurance market. Following a rash of historic wildfires in 2017 and 2018, insurance companies have fled the state, dropped tens of thousands of customers in flammable areas, and raised prices by double-digit percentages.\n\nUntil recently, elected officials have taken few major steps to address the crisis. But late last month, after more than a year of drafting, California\u2019s insurance commissioner unveiled a set of reforms that he claimed will bring companies back into the fold as they take effect this year.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic moment for California,\u201d said Ricardo Lara, the state\u2019s insurance commissioner, when he revealed the rules in December. \u201cWith input from thousands of residents throughout California, this reform balances protecting consumers with the need to strengthen our market against climate risks.\u201d\n\nThe rules come after months of debate among state insurance officials, lawmakers, insurance companies, and consumer advocates. The biggest change is that California will now require many insurance companies to do more business in what the state calls \u201cdistressed areas,\u201d the fire-prone scrubland and mountain regions where insurers are now hiking prices and dropping customers. Companies will soon have to ensure that their market share in these areas is at least 85 percent of their total statewide market share\u2014in other words, if a company controls 10 percent of the state\u2019s insurance market, it must control at least 8.5 percent of the market in fire-prone areas.\n\nThis mandate should push big companies like State Farm and Allstate to pick up customers they\u2019ve dropped in flammable regions like the mountainous north of the state. Some companies have already begun to offer new policies in burned areas in anticipation of the state\u2019s new rules: the insurance company Mercury announced last week that it will be the first insurance company in the state to offer new policies in Paradise, California, which was destroyed in the catastrophic 2018 Camp Fire. The move recognizes the town\u2019s work to mitigate future fires by clearing trees and hardening homes."

HP, Lenovo, Dell, Acer and Asus all demoed new AI PC offerings at the Las Vegas event.\n\nHP unveiled the Z2 Mini and ZBook Ultra, which the company claims enables users to engage in 3D design, render graphics-intensive projects simultaneously, and work locally with LLMs.\n\nThe new HP hardware is powered by AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO processor. HP said the ZBook Ultra offers features up to 16 desktop-class CPU cores, discrete-like integrated graphics, and up to 128GB of innovative unified memory architecture, and the ability to assign up to 96GB RAM to the graphics processing unit (GPU).\n\nLenovo used the event to demonstrate the enhanced user experience available on the Intel Core Ultra-powered Lenovo AI Now and Lenovo Aura Edition PCs.\n\nLenovo AI Now on the company\u2019s flagship ThinkPad X9 offers what Lenovo calls \u201can advanced on-device AI assistant\u201d to deliver real-time intelligence to users. Built on a local large language model (LLM) using Meta\u2019s Llama 3.0, Lenovo AI Now stores and processes all user data locally, which Lenovo said safeguards user information while delivering powerful, real-time AI capabilities. Lenovo said it can be used to automate and simplify tasks such as document organisation and device management, supporting AI applications such as natural language queries across locally stored documents.\n\nThe company said it will be expanding Lenovo AI Now\u2019s capabilities with the ability to search for information across PCs and supported tablet devices, and an intelligent search capability for retrieving relevant information from selected portions of images or documents.\n\nDell has focused on simplifying AI development on PCs. Its new Dell Pro AI Studio offers an AI toolkit with validated tools, frameworks, templates and models, to help developers and IT administrators build and manage AI software independent of the underlying silicon. Dell claims this can reduce development and deployment time by as much as 75%, going from six months to as little as six weeks.\n\nAcer\u2019s new Copilot+ lineup includes the Swift Go 16 AI and Swift Go 14 AI laptops and the Aspire C AI AIOs. These are powered by AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors. The hardware uses the AMD XDNA 2 NPU architecture, which Acer said delivers up to 50 TOPS (tera operations per second) of AI performance and includes AMD Radeon 800M graphics. According to Acer, the new Swift Go AI laptops are able to run efficiently and reliably for all-day use with a battery life of up to 24.9 hours of video playback. It has also introduced the Intel Core-powered Aspire S AI and Revo Box AI devices.\n\nBeyond x86-based AI PCs, Asus unveiled its Snapdragon-powered Zenbook A14. This device uses the Snapdragon X Series Processors and offers up to 45W TDP performance along with a neural processing capability of 45 TOPS. Asus claims it offers up to 32 hours of battery life, which can be further extended or customised with MyASUS Battery Care Mode. The device includes 2 USB 4.0 ports, an audio jack, a type-A port and an HDMI port."

            "source": "ZDNet",
            "article_content": "SEAN GLADWELL/Getty Images\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is when brands make major announcements for product releases and unveil cool concepts and mockups for future projects. So it's no surprise that Genki -- a third-party gaming and PC accessories manufacturer -- showed off some new devices.\n\nAlso: CES 2025: The 15 most impressive products you don't want to miss\n\nWhat caught us off guard, however, was Genki's alleged mockup of a Nintendo Switch 2 console and Joy-Con controllers. Just how much does this confirm previous leaks? And is there any new information about the upcoming console ahead of Nintendo's official announcement later this year? Here's everything we know -- and don't know -- about Genki's Switch 2 mockup.\n\nWhat we know\n\nGenki (aka, Human Things Inc.) is a third-party manufacturer of gaming accessories.\n\nGenki's accessory focus is power and storage solutions (cases, SSDs, wall chargers).\n\nGenki showed up to CES 2025 with an alleged mockup of the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nGenki claims the Switch 2 will be released in April.\n\nNintendo plans to officially announce the Switch 2 sometime before the end of Q1 2025\n\nWhat we don't know\n\nHow did Genki get a hold of a fully 3D-printed mockup?\n\nWhy would the company risk Nintendo's notoriously litigious wrath by leaking significant details ahead of an official announcement?\n\nIs this a viral marketing stunt for their accessories?\n\nWhen will the Switch 2 be released?\n\nHow much will the Switch 2 cost at release?\n\nIn typical fashion, official Nintendo channels have neither confirmed nor denied any of the details provided by Genki and its mockup of the Switch 2. But that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from going into high gear. A few things seem to corroborate, if not confirm, previous leaks -- such as the potential for magnetic Joy-Con controllers and the console itself being bigger than the current Switch OLED.\n\nExciting as all this is, however, something feels off. First, Genki's mockup looks remarkably like some debunked CAD files leaked to Reddit in 2024. The source of those files claimed to have obtained console information from a third-party manufacturer \"at great cost\" and \"reverse-engineered\" the CAD files.\n\nWith Nintendo being such a hot commodity, it's not outside the realm of possibility that this could be an elaborate attempt to drum up interest in Genki's (frankly) run-of-the-mill accessories, which consist mostly of USB-C cables and video capture cards that look sourced from other manufacturers and branded with the Genki logo.\n\nAlso: This low-cost Lenovo PC is the desktop I recommend to most people - even though its made for gamers\n\nI wasn't able to find any details on Human Things Inc. other than a suspiciously empty LinkedIn page with a URL that leads directly back to the Genki retail page. Their blog is woefully sparse, with just four posts; the first in 2019, one in 2023, and two from 2024. None make mention of any company operations, but the site's front page proudly tells you they were successfully backed on Kickstarter by over 50,000 people.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, the alleged Switch 2 leak feels more like a poorly planned viral marketing effort. And Genki isn't the first vendor to take this approach. In December 2024, Canadian company Dbrand claimed to have obtained official 3D scans of the Nintendo Switch 2 from an unspecified source to promote their Killswitch 2 case.\n\nIn the end, this alleged leak doesn't add any significant new information and doesn't confirm anything we didn't already hear before. Nintendo is set to make an official announcement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2's release date, retail price, and tech specs sometime before April 2024."
