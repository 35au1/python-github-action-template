        "article_content": "Many of the reported cases of alleged alien encounters, flying saucers, or abductions take place in remote locations, far from the eyes and cameras of almost anyone, or in conditions that make it difficult to see anything clearly. For those who fabricate such experiences, it is a necessary alibi. The case of New Yorker Linda Napolitano, a housewife of Italian descent who said she was abducted by aliens in 1989, generated huge media coverage for exactly the opposite reason: she claimed that a UFO had taken her from her bedroom by means of a tractor beam in the early hours of the morning, in the middle of Manhattan.\n\nTogether with researcher Budd Hopkins, one of the most famous figures in ufology, she brought 23 witnesses to the table who supported her story and said they had seen her fly over the Brooklyn Bridge. The family not only confirmed the veracity of her experiences, but also declared themselves victims of interventions from outer space. And they all stand firm, to the point that Napolitano, who is now 77 years old, has just sued Netflix over a documentary that casts serious doubts on what some media dubbed \u201cthe abduction of the century.\u201d\n\nThe three-episode series, The Manhattan Alien Abduction, was written by Linda Napolitano herself and premiered in the U.S. on October 30, just in time for Halloween. It certainly has terrifying elements, not so much in the dramatizations of the abduction itself, but testimonies such as that of her son, who appears with his face obscured and claims to have been in psychological treatment for years over the trauma of alien visits of which he, who experienced the coverage of the case as a child, is entirely convinced. However, there is another woman who manages to displace Napolitano from the center of the documentary: Carol Rainey, Hopkins\u2019 ex-wife and a notable skeptic of her former husband\u2019s work, especially on the Manhattan case. The basis of the complaint against Netflix is that the participation of Rainey, who died in 2023, is much greater than the aggrieved party expected. Napolitano says she was assured Rainey would make only one appearance, but she is, by all accounts, the co-star.\n\nThe apartment block in Manhattan where Linda Napolitano was allegedly abducted by aliens in 1989. General (\u00a92005 Credit:TopFoto/Fortean)\n\nAs such, The Manhattan Alien Abduction is much more interesting than a mere reconstruction of a 35-year-old UFO file. Its unexpected focus on Rainey allows us to access another story, that of someone who, out of respect for the man she had once loved, for the credibility and objectivity she once had, made the tough decision to disavow him in a shattering publication that questioned his rigor and methodology. \u201cI saw that I was losing objectivity. I loved Budd. He seemed to me to have complete integrity. Completely honest. But if it was a hoax, I needed to know if my husband was complicit,\u201d Rainey states in the documentary. Peter Robbins, Hopkins\u2019 assistant and friend, who blames Rainey for Hopkins\u2019 book Witnessed: The True Story Of The Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions (1996) not being republished or made into a film adaptation, doesn\u2019t see it that way: \u201cHer goal in life was to destroy this man and destroy his reputation.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a harpy,\u201d Napolitano goes so far as to say on camera.\n\nThe housewife\u2019s story contained bizarre elements that went beyond the 1989 abduction. A year later, Napolitano alerted Hopkins that she was being harassed by two men named Dan and Richard, who had witnessed the event from an official car in which they were transporting none other than then-Secretary General of the United Nations Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar. Hopkins, who never saw them himself, gave credence to the letters she received signed in their name and that of the diplomat. According to Napolitano, the men kidnapped her and Dan, who was madly in love with her, ended up in a psychiatric hospital. She also underwent an X-ray test to prove that a lump in her nose was the result of an alien graft. The X-ray revealed that it did appear to house a small cylindrical object, but when she later agreed to undergo surgery to remove it, the object never appeared.\n\nI want to believe\n\nSociologist, writer and editor Pablo Vergel, a contributor to Spanish TV show Cuarto Milenio, which covers mysteries and enigmas, spoke to Napolitano several years ago via Facebook. His intention was to have her participate in a report on the show, although he was unable to get her to appear in front of the cameras. Vergel acknowledges to EL PA\u00cdS that it is \u201ca very problematic case,\u201d which owes its popularity to the context and \u201cthe series of incredible twists and turns that followed, a real soap opera, thanks to which it had a lot of coverage in the tabloid press [...] Iconically, this UFO that lifts someone from their apartment with a ray, takes them out and crosses the most famous skyline in the world, over the Brooklyn Bridge, cannot be more powerful,\u201d he says. In 2021, Vergel published in Spain a book by Budd Hopkins, Intruders, originally from 1987 and one of the key titles in the abduction phenomenon in the United States.\n\nWhitley Strieber photographed in 2016. David Livingston (Getty Images)\n\n\u201cBudd Hopkins is part of the triad of researchers who created the great wave of abductions in the United States, almost a sociological phenomenon, along with Whitley Strieber and John E. Mack,\u201d explains the editor. \u201cHe did have a certain courage; he created support groups for people who said they had been abducted, he established mechanisms and protocols\u2026 Whitley Strieber, the famous author of Communion (1987), turned to Budd Hopkins and said in his book that he helped him a lot in managing his emotional crisis after the traumatic experience he had [his alleged encounter with extraterrestrials]. But at a certain point he began to act like a devotee, like an absolute believer who could not conceive of any alternative explanation. Many people have accused him of having been an evangelist of the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial hypothesis, rather than of investigating it. He abused hypnosis a lot. If you read his books, hypnosis does not follow methodological controls, it leaves suggestion very open. There is even the possibility of ending up implanting memories in the person. Budd Hopkins \u2014 and I say this as his editor \u2014 seems to me to be an interesting author, but also very questionable.\u201d\n\nThe sociologist refers to a study of the Napolitano case published in 1993 by parapsychologist George P. Hansen, together with Joseph J. Stefula and Richard D. Butler, who was critical of Hopkins for not verifying the \u201cvery close\u201d relationship between the housewife and the professional who performed the X-ray test, or the independence of the supposed 23 witnesses to the phenomenon. Among the testimonies that Hopkins had accepted as valid was that of a woman who said she had not been able to see clearly because of the fog \u2014 on a morning when such weather conditions did not occur \u2014 or that of another who, excusing herself on the grounds of her fear, did not close the curtains at her window that night. Hansen and his colleagues found as many as 16 parallels between Napolitano\u2019s story and Garfield Reeves-Stevens\u2019 1989 science fiction novel Nighteyes. They also questioned Hopkins\u2019 honesty, noting that the alleged abductee said he had promised her half the profits from his book about her case.\n\nRobbins, the colleague who backs Hopkins in The Manhattan Alien Abduction, brings up in his statements that Rainey, the researcher\u2019s ex-wife, grew up in a fundamentalist Christian family belonging to the Plymouth Brethren, to suggest that she opposed the extraterrestrial hypothesis because of her religion. Rainey argues in the documentary that, precisely, her experience with Hopkins reopened a wound from the past, when she was estranged from her entire family for questioning the faith: \u201cHis dogma was as radical as my father\u2019s. They both never doubted and seemed to be in possession of the truth. I could not tolerate what he was doing to very vulnerable people,\u201d Rainey said in reference to Hopkins\u2019 hypnosis sessions with people convinced they were being visited by extraterrestrials.\n\nNapolitano, who is said in the series to have had a frustrated vocation as a music star, has called the late Rainey \u201cresentful and alcoholic\u201d in her lawsuit, as well as damaging to her reputation. Nevertheless, The Manhattan Alien Abduction is conciliatory to anyone who really wants to believe her story. Through the theme of faith, the documentary does allow us to glimpse that, among the scholars or mere lovers of the UFO phenomenon, there are those who, with more or less rigor, try to collate their research, and those who only seek to confirm their own beliefs.\n\nDepending on your preferences, the Brooklyn Bridge story generated a previous documentary that completely takes the authenticity of the matter for granted: Linda Napolitano: The Alien Abduction of the Century (2022). Although Napolitano does not participate in it, we are told, based on the thesis of a certain Corrado Malanga, an Italian researcher of the holographic universe, that humans are the most spiritually developed creatures in the universe and that aliens abduct us to imprint their memories in our unconscious, in order to become immortal with our soul.

        "article_content": "Those curious of life outside our world can find fun Saturday at the Carbondalien Festival, which celebrates the milestone of a mysterious event in Carbondale\u2019s history.\n\nThe Carbondalien Festival marks the 50th anniversary of the infamous incident near Russell Park in Carbondale that many believe was a UFO crash landing on Nov. 9, 1974. The festival will be held Saturday at the park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nThe event is hosted by the Carbondale Arts Alliance and will have vendors, food trucks, speakers, art and live music.\n\nNicole Curtis, the Carbondalien Festival\u2019s organizer, \u201cCarbondalien-in-Chief\u201d and co-owner of the City Line Shop Cafe in Carbondale, was inspired to start the festival as an alien art walk after seeing how art helped save other nearby small towns.\n\nMany townspeople are not aware of the UFO event since many did not want to discuss it for fear of being ridiculed. There were many sightings of the UFO that allegedly crashed from around the county, from the Scranton area to Carbondale, according to Curtis.\n\nWhat occurred 50 years ago is an \u201camazing incredible thing that not many people know about that should be celebrated and not be ashamed about,\u201d said Curtis. On that day, \u201csomething glowed in the water for nine hours and left on a flatbed truck,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the newspaper archives, the legend began on Nov. 9, 1974, when three teenage boys alerted police after witnessing a \u201cred, whirring ball\u201d fall from the sky and into a mine pond. The incident drew police, military and the curious to the city and concluded with a dive team pulling a battery-powered mine lantern from the pond.\n\nCurtis started planning for the Carbondalien Festival a year ago by looking for an artist to design an alien and reached out to Jennifer Forgione, known as JFo, studio artist of JFo Generation in Spring Brook Twp.\n\nForgione\u2019s mother was an eyewitness to the UFO while observing the sky at her home in Dunmore. This synchronistic event is \u201cwhy I am so passionate about it and it is a very good thing,\u201d said Forgione, who is excited to participate in the festival linked to her mother\u2019s UFO sighting.\n\nThose wanting to know about the legend can watch the theatrical performance, \u201cThe Russel Park Experience,\u201d presented in partnership with the Lackawanna Historical Society. The performance immerses the audience as a member of the press at the crash site trying to get the facts of what happened. Performances will take place at Russell Park at 11:45 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m.\n\nThe festival is a \u201cgreat opportunity to meet interesting people and learn new things,\u201d as well as a place to meet \u201clike-minded people in the cryptid and UFO world,\u201d said Curtis.\n\nFestivalgoers can learn more about UFO topics at the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite. Speakers include: James Krug with \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers & How to Become a MUFON Investigator,\u201d Bill Weber with \u201cUFO Sightings and Cover Ups,\u201d Tim Renner with \u201cThe 1920\u2019s Bigfoot Flap in Pennsylvania\u201d and Alan B. Smith with \u201cExposing UFO Debunkers.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Carbondalien Festival will have a ticketed after-party event at the ballroom of the Hotel Anthracite with a cocktail hour, dinner and presentation of \u201cWorld of the Weird\u201d by Heather Taddy, known as the team documentarian on A&E\u2019s hit television series \u201cParanormal State,\u201d from 6 to 8:30 p.m.\n\nThroughout the city, 34 local businesses are hosting a scavenger hunt with 7-foot-tall wooden aliens unique to each location. Visitors can vote for their favorite design on the festival\u2019s website.\n\nOther activities include a free Alien Swim at the Carbondale YMCA, and an Alien Storytime and Craft, Alien Teen Bingo and Extraterrestrial Film Festival at the Carbondale Public Library.\n\nAccording to Forgione, the more people who get excited about the festival, the less people will be afraid of aliens.\n\n\u201cYou see a cute little heinie on the alien and smile and laugh,\u201d Forgione said of her artwork. Forgione will be selling handmade 7-foot-tall, 4-foot-tall and 2-foot-tall wooden aliens at the event, along with alien ornaments.\n\nCurtis said the event is to keep \u201can openness to what the story could be.\u201d This gives people an opportunity to not argue over the story, but ponder the possibilities.\n\n\u201cMany feel ostracized talking and sharing their story,\u201d said Forgione. \u201cThere might be so many stories that people are afraid to tell.\u201d\n\nAn eyewitness who wishes to remain anonymous and was first on the scene has donated stacks of photos, business cards of reporters who came to town and typed-up reports about the event to the Lackawanna Historical Society, according to Curtis.\n\nCurtis hopes the Carbondalien Festival helps to build tourism for the town by getting people to see what the town has to offer. She wants the Carbondalien Festival to evolve into an annual event.\n\nThose attending the event will find \u201can escape from a regular day and have a magical one-of-a-kind experience,\u201d said Forgione.\n\nFor more information about the Carbondalien Festival and to purchase tickets for the after-party, go to carbondalienfestival.com.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Carbondalien Festival\n\nWhen: Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nWhere: Russell Park on 11th Avenue and along Main Street in the city\u2019s downtown.\n\nEvents: The immersive \u201cThe Russel Park Experience\u201d at the park, the Supernatural Speaker Series at the Hotel Anthracite, a citywide scavenger hunt, alien-themed activities at the Carbondale Public Library and more.

        "article_content": "Tech companies continue to roll out new generative AI apps and services. Microsoft (MSFT) has its Copilot for Windows; Apple (AAPL) has Apple Intelligence for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac; Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has Gemini for its apps and Pixel phones; and Meta (META) has Meta AI for its various social media services. But despite all of the hype, I\u2019m still not sold on these apps. At least not yet.\n\nI\u2019ve been using each company\u2019s products for a while now, and while they\u2019ve got some intriguing capabilities, none of them has the kind of features that make me want them to be a part of my daily life. The problem, at least so far, is that much of what these companies have to offer are solutions for niche situations or kitschy demos for what\u2019s to come down the line.\n\nWhether that\u2019s manipulating photos to completely alter their settings, changing an artificial intelligence app\u2019s voice to a celebrity\u2019s voice, or creating generative AI-based emojis, I haven\u2019t come across a single generative AI feature that would convince me to spend $800 on a new phone or PC or make me want to change how I use apps. But there\u2019s potential on the horizon.\n\nLimited uses for most users\n\nIf you\u2019re an Android user, you\u2019ve likely at least tried some of the company\u2019s generative AI capabilities via Google\u2019s Pixel phones or Samsung\u2019s Galaxy line of devices. There\u2019s the ability to edit photos to do things like make your 4-year-old appear as though she\u2019s dunking a basketball on a regulation-height hoop or that your dog is driving your car. You can also reimagine your photos to, say, transform a road into a rushing river, or even add objects to them that weren\u2019t there before.\n\nApple also offers photo editing capabilities with its first wave of Apple Intelligence features, though it\u2019s far tamer than Google\u2019s, only allowing you to remove objects from the background of your photos like a person walking behind your subject in a shot or a cup off of a table.\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot+PCs are Windows PC with added generative AI features like the company's Copilot chatbot software. (JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images) (JASON REDMOND via Getty Images)\n\nMeta AI can pull off the same tricks as Google, letting you do things like remove large objects from images or transform the floor in a photo into lava. It\u2019s all a bit of fun to use at first, but unless you\u2019re spending a lot of time posting the perfect shot to Instagram every day, there\u2019s little reason to regularly use these apps. Is that worth buying a new $799 iPhone or $999 for a Surface laptop or changing your routine to use a new piece of software? Not really.\n\nTech companies are also offering features that can summarize large chunks of text, rewrite emails to make them more professional or more casual, and prepare bullet points to help quickly digest the most important parts of a report. These can be helpful if you\u2019re trying to plow through a massive document, but it\u2019s hard to imagine most people taking advantage of such an option in their daily lives.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re the type of person who needs to closely read reports, surveys, or emails for exact details, you\u2019re probably not going to put all of your trust into a generative AI app to get all of the information you require, especially when they\u2019re able to make up information and then present it as though it\u2019s fact.\n\nI find chatting with AI bots helpful at times, but it still hasn\u2019t replaced Google as my go-to for looking up information on the web. And I\u2019m definitely not about to pony up a chunk of change just to chat with a robot.\n\nThere\u2019s more to come\n\nWhile the first slate of generative AI apps and services may not be the generation-defining raft of technologies that tech companies have been hyping them as, there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity ahead.\n\nApple plans to continue to update its Apple Intelligence platform throughout the rest of 2024 and into 2025, while Google and Microsoft regularly announce new capabilities for their respective consumer generative AI offerings. Meta also continues to debut new options for its own Meta AI service.\n\nBut the real excitement will come as third-party developers begin to push out their own generative AI-enabled apps over the months and years ahead. What we\u2019re getting right now is sort of a test run of what generative AI can do for the average consumer, but third-party developers will likely be the ones that give us the killer apps that make the technology a hit among users.\n\nThink of it like when Apple first launched the App Store. Sure, iPhones were cool and interesting, but sales really took off once Apple allowed third-party developers to start selling apps of their own for its flagship device. If generative AI is going to be as revolutionary a product as the tech industry promises, it\u2019ll be third-party developers that get us there.\n\nNow we just have to wait for them to do their thing.\n\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.

These would most likely be powered by Google's Gemini AI chatbot.\n\nYou already get a comprehensive experience from Call Screen as it works today: the caller hears a spoken message asking them to state their business, and you get a text transcript of what they've said. You can then join the call, or send some basic responses \u2013 like \"call me back\" or \"thank you\" \u2013 if you're not available to talk.\n\nThis new upgrade would make those responses more varied and complex, powered by a large language model. It seems that you would still get the option to choose from a selection of responses on the screen, rather than starting from scratch.\n\nGoogle markets Call Screen as a time saver (Image credit: Google)\n\nCall Screen was only just updated last month, with more context-aware quick replies \u2013 ones that aren't just generic responses (so if the call is about an appointment, you might see \"confirm\" or \"cancel\" options, for example).\n\nIt's not clear exactly how the more detailed responses might work, as the 9to5Google team wasn't able to dig out any screenshots or get the feature turned on, but the new answers will most probably be along similar lines to a typical Gemini AI chatbot response.\n\nAnother bunch of Pixel updates \u2013 which Google calls Pixel Drops \u2013 should be announced very soon, though this particular new feature might not be included. Google may need more time to refine the way it works, and it's worth noting that the hidden code already includes the standard disclaimer about the unreliability of AI responses.\n\nGet the best Black Friday deals direct to your inbox, plus news, reviews, and more.

The study ranked counties and local authorities based on reports of paranormal activity per square mile, creating a \"paranormal activity score\" to determine the most supernaturally dense areas in the UK. This approach highlights where ghostly encounters are most concentrated.\n\nSo which town is officially the most haunted with a Paranormal Activity Score of 100 and 43 reported paranormal activities and haunted locations all concentrated in just 15 square miles? The would be Ipswich. The Ancient House is known for ghostly monk sightings and mysterious footsteps, while Christchurch Mansion is home to the ghost of a young Victorian maid. The Ipswich Museum, with reported sightings of a phantom Edwardian lady, offers a cultural twist to ghostly encounters.\n\nAlex Wilson, CEO and founder of Affordable Urns, said: \"Our research reveals some exciting destinations for paranormal enthusiasts. The high concentration of reported hauntings in these areas speaks to the rich history and enduring legends of the UK. While we encourage people to explore these fascinating locations, we also urge visitors to approach them with respect and caution. Many of these sites have historical significance and may have restricted access. Always ensure you have proper permission before visiting and follow all safety guidelines. Whether you're a believer in the supernatural or simply enjoy a good scare, these locations offer a supernatural way to connect with the past and perhaps experience something unexplainable.\"\n\n1.

Even, the Ipswich Museum chills visitors with a phantom Edwardian lady stalking its halls.\n\n2. Lincoln\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nLincoln emerges as a close second on the spooky scale, ranking high with a Paranormal Activity Score of 82.20. The city's 14 square miles shudder with 33 reports of hauntings and ghost sightings. Lincoln Castle's walls echo with the cries of a woman executed after being accused of witchcraft. The Magna Carta pub buzzes with stories of a ghostly monk and a cavalier. And, the imposing Lincoln Cathedral's Gothic setting comes with many tales of the spiritual realm, including the \"Swinging Monk\".\n\n3. Cambridge\n\nImage: Cambridge News) Cambridge News)\n\nIn third place, Cambridge lurks with a ghastly score of 74.09. Paranormal enthusiasts have recorded 34 unsettling spiritual occurrences across the city's 16 square miles. Amongst Cambridge's spooky highlights are Corpus Christi College, haunted by the apparition of former master Dr. Butts, while Peterhouse College hosts the ghost of Francis Dawes.

For those seeking a cosy setting for ghostly encounters, the Well House Tavern, haunted by the ghost of a Spanish lady, is the place to be.\n\n5.

Over the decades, several US outlets have carried stories about ghostly sightings and mysterious night-time noises plaguing the 18th-century building. On the big result day, these stories are circulating again on the internet, and here's what we know about them.\n\nAccording to a report in the Washington Post, there are numerous accounts of encounters with former residents, including the founding father and third president, Thomas Jefferson. However, the most famous spirit believed to haunt the White House is that of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president.\n\nIn 1946, President Harry S Truman wrote to his wife in a letter that is archived in his presidential library and museum.\n\n\"I jumped up and put on my bathrobe, opened the door, and no one there,\" he wrote. \"Went out and looked up and down the hall, looked in your room and Margie's. Still no one. Went back to bed after locking the doors and there were footsteps in your room whose door I'd left open. Jumped and looked and no one there! The damned place is haunted sure as shootin'. Secret Service said not even a watchman was up here at that hour.\"\n\n\"You and Margie had better come back and protect me before some of these ghosts carry me off.\"\n\nAccording to USA Today, the most famous ghost haunting the White House is undoubtedly that of Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president. After his assassination in 1865, Lincoln's ghost reportedly appeared in both the Yellow Oval Room and the Lincoln Bedroom. He is said to have materialised to notable figures, including First Lady Grace Coolidge (wife of President Calvin Coolidge), British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, making him the most frequently sighted spirit in the White House.\n\nThe news outlet also reported that residents and staff members have, on various occasions, witnessed the ghost of Abigail Adams, America's second First Lady, hanging laundry or noticed a scent of lavender and damp clothing in the East Room.\n\nIn a 2018 interview on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Jenna Bush Hager shared that she heard 1920s piano music emanating from her room's fireplace. Jenna and her sister Barbara, daughters of President George W. Bush, heard music from the fireplace in the Lincoln Room on two separate occasions: first, 1920s piano music one week, and then opera music the following week, as Jenna later recounted to Hoda Kotb on the Today show.\n\n\"Our phone rang, and I woke up, and all of a sudden we heard like 1920s piano music coming out of our fireplace ... It was like the middle of the night, and you can feel the music out of the fireplace,\" Jenna said on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\".\n\n"

He built an entirely new administration for his first term and has definite ideas on what to do differently this time.\n\nHe\u2019s already floated some names.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: To win Pennsylvania, Donald Trump did exactly what he needed to in Philly: Improved slightly\n\nTrump said at his victory party early Wednesday that former presidential hopeful and anti-vaccination activist Robert Kennedy Jr. will be tapped to \u201chelp make America healthy again,\u201d adding that \u201cwe\u2019re going to let him go to it.\u201d Ahead of the election, Trump didn\u2019t reject Kennedy\u2019s calls to end fluoridated water. Trump has also pledged to make South African-born Elon Musk, a vocal supporter of the Trump campaign, a secretary of federal \u201ccost-cutting,\u201d and the Tesla CEO has suggested he can find trillions of dollars in government spending to wipe out.\n\nThe transition is not just about filling jobs. Most presidents-elect also receive daily or near-daily intelligence briefings during the transition.\n\nIn 2008, outgoing President George W. Bush personally briefed President-elect Barack Obama on U.S. covert operations. When Trump was preparing to take office in 2016, Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice, briefed Michael Flynn, her designated successor in the new administration. In 2020, Trump\u2019s legal challenges of the election\u2019s results delayed the start of the transition process for weeks, though, and presidential briefings with Biden didn\u2019t begin until Nov. 30.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump won Pa. with more votes than any statewide Republican candidate in history. Here\u2019s how he did it.\n\nWho is helping Trump through the process?\n\nTrump\u2019s transition is being led primarily by friends and family, including Kennedy Jr. and former Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, as well as the president-elect\u2019s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and his running mate, JD Vance. Transition co-chairs are Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, Haverford College\u2019s largest donor, and Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who previously led the Small Business Administration during Trump\u2019s first term.\n\nLutnick said this year\u2019s operation is \u201cabout as different as possible\u201d from the 2016 effort, which was first led by Chris Christie. After he won eight years ago, Trump fired Christie, tossed out plans the former New Jersey governor had made and gave the job of running the transition to then-Vice President-elect Mike Pence.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Pa. Democrats on what went wrong against Donald Trump and what\u2019s next\n\nAt the start of his first term, Trump assembled an original cabinet that featured some more mainstream Republicans and business leaders who ultimately disappointed, or broke publicly with him, or both. This time, Trump has promised to value loyalty as much as possible \u2014 a philosophy that may ensure he makes picks that are more closely aligned to his ideological beliefs and bombastic professional style.\n\nUnlike the campaign of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump\u2019s team didn\u2019t sign any pre-Election Day transition agreements with the General Services Administration, which essentially acts as the federal government\u2019s landlord. He has therefore already missed deadlines to agree with GSA on logistical matters like office space and tech support and with the White House on access to agencies, including documents, employees, and facilities.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Disappointed voters and organizers in Philadelphia say gender and racial biases contributed to Harris\u2019 loss\n\nNew transition rules\n\nIn 2020, Trump argued that widespread voter fraud \u2014 which hadn\u2019t actually occurred \u2014 cost him the election, delaying the start of the transition from his outgoing administration to Biden\u2019s incoming one for weeks.\n\nFour years ago, the Trump-appointed head of the GSA, Emily Murphy, determined that she had no legal standing to determine a winner in the presidential race because Trump was still challenging the results in court. That held up funding and cooperation for the transition.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump\u2019s win touches off a mix of celebration and trepidation in the Philly region\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Trump\u2019s efforts to subvert election results had collapsed across key states that Murphy agreed to formally \u201cascertain a president-elect\u201d and begin the transition process. Trump eventually posted on social media that his administration would cooperate.\n\nTo prevent that kind of holdup in future transitions, the Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 mandates that the transition process begin five days after the election \u2014 even if the winner is still in dispute. That is designed to avoid long delays and means that \u201can \u2018affirmative ascertainment\u2019 by the GSA is no longer a prerequisite for gaining transition support services,\u201d according to agency guidelines on the new rules.\n\n\u00bb READ MORE: Donald Trump\u2019s growing support among Latino voters helped him clinch battleground Pennsylvania\n\nThe uncertainty stretched even longer after the 2000 election, when five weeks elapsed before the Supreme Court settled the contested election between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore. That left Bush with about half the usual amount of time to manage transitioning the government from the outgoing Clinton administration. That ultimately led to questions about national security gaps that may have contributed to the U.S. being underprepared for the Sept. 11 attacks the following year."

        "article_content": "Apple this week released the latest developer beta of tvOS 18.2, the software that powers the company\u2019s Apple TV 4K streaming media devices. As previewed during the WWDC 2024 keynote, the new software includes support for 21:9 and several other aspect ratios that are wider than 16:9, which has become the dominant shape for modern TVs.\n\nWhy does that matter?\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMost of us have experienced letterboxing or pillarboxing \u2014 that\u2019s when a set of horizontal or vertical black bars frame the content on our TVs. It happens when there\u2019s a mismatch between the aspect ratio of a movie or show and the aspect ratio of your screen.\n\nA lot of modern content, especially shows and movies developed for streaming services like Netflix, Max, Paramount+, or Apple TV+, is shot in 16:9, so letterboxing that content on 16:9 TVs isn\u2019t necessary. On the Apple TV 4K, even the user interface is formatted for this ratio, which keeps things looking good.\n\nHowever, some folks own projector screens or widescreen monitors with non-16:9 aspect ratios. For these people, all Apple TV 4K content ends up with those pesky black bars because the device\u2019s signal is formatted for 16:9. When tvOS 18.2 arrives for everyone in December, the software should automatically detect the ratio of your display, and reformat itself to match.\n\nIf that detection fails, a new Aspect Ratio settings menu will let you manually select the appropriate one for your setup. Available ratios are 16:9, 21:9, 2.37:1, 2.39:1, 2.40:1, DCI 4K, and 32:9.\n\nIt will be the first time that someone who owns a 21:9 projector, or who uses an anamorphic lens to achieve a ratio like 2.39:1, can get the Apple TV 4K to produce a perfectly proportioned and fullscreen image.\n\nSo how many people will benefit from the new settings? \u201cIt really won\u2019t affect very many,\u201d said Jeff Gosselin, chief experience officer at Cloud 9 AV, a Toronto-based custom home theater installer. \u201cAny new theaters we have done in the past 15 years have all used 16:9 screens. For any ultrawide projection systems, this will be an enhanced viewing experience.\u201d\n\nPillarboxing will still likely occur when watching 16:9 content on such a screen, but when 21:9 content is available, it should play in fullscreen, with no black bars.\n\nPresumably, app developers \u2014 like the services mentioned above \u2014 will have to update their apps to ensure that their content displays correctly under the new aspect ratio settings. But eventually, this will become the norm."

        "article_content": "The temptation to upgrade any piece of mobile technology annually is always there, as new versions and updates are introduced regularly. It\u2019s always great to have the latest model, but it\u2019s expensive, slightly wasteful, and becoming more unnecessary all the time to change regularly. You\u2019re a lot stronger than I am if you can resist the siren call.\n\nWhat is there to do? If you want to get off the expensive tech upgrade train, you need to buy a product that will last and take years to be genuinely superseded. What you need is a smart ring, as I think it\u2019s the most consumer-friendly piece of wearable tech we\u2019ve seen yet. It\u2019s not an immediately obvious thing, but here\u2019s why I think it\u2019s absolutely true.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nA consumer-friendly wearable\n\nThe smart ring \u2014 any smart ring \u2014 is consumer-friendly in just about every sense of the phrase, as it really won\u2019t need upgrading very often, purely as a result of what it is and what you expect of it. Smart rings are based on a piece of jewelry that is commonly purchased once and worn forever. They\u2019re inconspicuous on our fingers, go with every outfit in every situation, and never make you feel nerdy or self-conscious. No one will likely know you\u2019ve got a smart ring unless you point it out, so there\u2019s less of that need to show off that you have with the latest style.\n\nBy design, we\u2019re supposed to buy a regular ring and never have to take it off unless we want to, and while more may be added to a collection, they\u2019re not a product that\u2019s upgraded like a piece of technology. But a smart ring is a piece of tech, so won\u2019t it still need regular upgrades to stay relevant and working? No, not really, and this is where they start to make a lot of sense if you\u2019d prefer to buy a product that will last and not feel like you\u2019re missing out or being compromised should a new version arrive.\n\nA smart ring does not have a screen or a flagship processor. You can\u2019t play games on it, and there\u2019s no camera to improve over time. These are the primary reasons you may consider upgrading a phone and they simply aren\u2019t part of the equation for a smart ring. The battery life is already a week on most current smart rings, and if you charge it when you shower or get ready in the morning, you\u2019ll never once worry about battery life anyway, so any battery capacity boost in a new model probably won\u2019t change lives.\n\nBut new versions do come out, right?\n\nThe technology inside a smart ring revolves around the sensors used to measure your health. While sensor improvements may come along with each new model, there\u2019s no question we\u2019re at the point where the vast majority of trackers available now are as accurate as most people would need. The software and algorithms controlling them and analyzing the data can be refined, but many new software features introduced with new models reach older versions, too.\n\nFurthermore, because what\u2019s inside isn\u2019t influenced so much by other companies releasing new components like chips and cameras, an annual hardware release may be redundant anyway. Smart rings are at a point where they are thin, light, long-lasting, feature-packed, reliable, and accurate enough for most people. What, outside of the design, are manufacturers going to update each year? It\u2019s far more likely we will see biannual updates \u2014 or possibly even longer.\n\nThe Oura Ring 4 backs all this up. The newly released ring has an updated design that\u2019s not better or worse than the third-generation ring; it\u2019s just different. It\u2019s barely noticeable on my finger and looks excellent, just like the last version. The sensors and algorithms have slightly changed and been updated, but I haven\u2019t noticed any difference in the data it collects or the accuracy compared to my third-generation ring, which I have worn since 2021. The battery life appears to be about the same, too, and the updated app is used on both the new and the old version of the ring.\n\nI can\u2019t give you one primary reason to upgrade from the third-generation Oura Ring to the Oura Ring 4. Outside of you perhaps preferring the design or the finishes of the Ring 4, which is entirely subjective and does not change the way the smart ring works, you could happily stick with the ring that\u2019s already on your finger and not miss out. What\u2019s more, only the most eagle-eyed tech geek will ever know which model you\u2019re wearing. Oura has waited three years to update the Oura Ring, and if you buy it, I expect you will be able to do the same.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the Oura Ring\n\nNot convinced yet? I\u2019ve got one more argument Smart rings aren\u2019t designed for the hardcore fitness addict, even the more intensive ones like the Ultrahuman Ring Air, and you probably shouldn\u2019t choose one if you\u2019re at the beginning of a transformative fitness journey. A smartwatch would be a far better choice if you want to increase performance or ability and observe improvements.\n\nInstead, smart rings are lifestyle-orientated. They are excellent at monitoring sleep and general activity and are superb choices for tracking women\u2019s health, too. These aren\u2019t things you outgrow, and sensors are entirely capable of tracking them effectively today. If you aren\u2019t planning to upgrade your health and fitness regime, and don\u2019t want to track specific sports, a device upgrade to keep up won\u2019t be necessary either. You can buy and wear a smart ring with the confidence that it will last you for years.\n\nI\u2019ve mainly mentioned the Oura Ring so far, but it\u2019s the same story with the Samsung Galaxy Ring and the RingConn Gen 2. Both these smart rings have caught up with the Oura Ring in terms of design, finish, and associated apps, plus they have the same level of functionality. You could buy either one and be safe in the knowledge that any new models are unlikely to dramatically change for several years.\n\nKeen techies will always find a reason to upgrade a smartphone or a smartwatch when a new model comes out, but due to the relatively simple nature of a smart ring, the same reasons simply aren\u2019t there, even when you look really hard. Not only will you have fewer reasons to buy a new model when it\u2019s released, but manufacturers won\u2019t find many reasons to legitimately update the hardware every year either.\n\nSmart rings look great, easily fit into your life, provide meaningful data, require very little upkeep, and are as far removed from the annual tech upgrade cycle train as you can get. It\u2019s a win-win-win."
