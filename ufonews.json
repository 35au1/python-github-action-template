        "article_content": "As Earthlings, we\u2019re curious about whether alien civilizations like ours are out there or if they exist at all\u2014which is why scientists were intrigued when a mysterious shard of metal exhibited signs that it might have come from intelligent minds on a distant planet.\n\nThis peculiar specimen fell to Earth around 1947 in a supposed UFO wreck that seemed linked to the infamous Roswell incident, which had members of the general public believing a flying saucer had crashed to Earth. It turned out that the debris found in Roswell was actually from a U.S. Air Force balloon meant to spy on Soviet nuclear experiments.\n\nThe true origins of the metallic specimen were debated for decades. Eventually, Blink-182 frontman and UFO enthusiast Tom DeLonge\u2019s To the Stars Academy got a hold of it. The organization independently researches possible alien phenomena, and the sample had an apparently unprecedented material structure that could indicate an extraterrestrial technosignature. Then, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) for the U.S. government, took over the investigation to learn more about the object\u2019s physical and chemical properties that made it potentially capable of inertial mass reduction\u2014levitation.\n\nThe object in question is a magnesium alloy whose main components are magnesium and zinc. It also contains bismuth, lead, and other trace elements.\n\nAARO asked Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to conduct an analysis in 2022 because scientists were especially interested in whether the sample was of terrestrial origin and if its bismuth content meant it could have possibly been used by aliens as a terahertz waveguide, a metal object that directs electromagnetic waves emitted by an energy source. ORNL was originally established during WWII to investigate things such as atomic weapons, and most of what its scientists investigate is still energy-related. However, the lab has also studied materials suspected to be extraterrestrial. This metal shard specimen \u201cpurportedly exhibits extraordinary properties,\u201d according to AARO and ORNL\u2019s recently published findings on the object.\n\nORNL scientists looked for evidence of life beyond our planet by studying the sample for possible biosignatures , which are naturally occurring substances associated with life, and technosignatures , which are signs of extraterrestrial technology that scientists especially seek out when searching for intelligent life. Some UAPs might have both.\n\nIn looking for alien biosignatures, ORNL scientists wanted to see whether the isotopes of the metals in this alloy were from Earth. Finding out where the metals originated meant investigating their isotopic signatures. These represent the ratios of different element isotopes in a material (when versions of the same element exist, but each has a different atomic mass.) Analysis showed that the isotopic signatures of magnesium and lead indicated a terrestrial origin. The magnesium\u2019s isotopic signature had undergone some fractionation, or separation of lighter and heavier isotopes, probably due to stress from heat and physical or chemical manufacturing processes. However, it was still within the normal range for magnesium that forms on Earth, not an alien biosignature.\n\nStrengthening the case for a local origin, the magnesium in this sample also showed a proportion of isotopes that occurs only in our solar system. Scientists know this because the isotopic signature of magnesium originally comes from a particular star-forming region and so is unique to each star system. Magnesium is an extremely common element in the universe, produced in great amounts by larger, older stars that scatter it into space when they die and go supernova. It is often recycled by young star systems, where it forms a unique isotopic signature, depending on the conditions.\n\nMoving on, the lead in the object also matched the isotopic signatures for lead that originates on Earth. These signatures are so distinct that there is no way they could have come from any other body\u2014even the moon.\n\nWith no alien biosignatures present in the sample, the ORNL scientists turned their attention to technosignatures. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed that the crystalline structure of the magnesium was similar to the magnesium in alloys manufactured on Earth. With that confirmed, they tried to determine if the sample could have been part of a terahertz waveguide.\n\nWaveguides are metal objects that transmit electromagnetic waves. For example, the magnetron in your microwave oven transmits waves to the main oven cavity, where they heat up leftovers. A terahertz waveguide levels up this technology with much more intense terahertz waves, hypothetically enough to levitate an object if built using the right methods and materials.\n\n\u201cBased on the technologies developed by humans, waveguides can only channel radiation for purposes of communication, data collection, or heating but the conjecture for the UAP was that they were used for levitation,\u201d says Harvard University theoretical physicist Avi Loeb, Ph.D., who was not involved in the study. \u201cThat would represent a technology unknown to humans.\u201d\n\nTo qualify as a piece of alien technology, the sample would need to have a single layer of pure bismuth between layers of the magnesium alloy. This is because unadulterated bismuth can guide energy just like the magnetron in your microwave. Unlike anything in your microwave, bismuth is capable of directing terahertz waves. The problem is that the bismuth in this sample is neither pure nor in a single layer. There are multiple layers of bismuth between the magnesium layers, and the bismuth itself contains lead, both of which would disrupt its functioning as a waveguide.\n\n\u201cORNL has a high level of confidence that all data indicate the material was manufactured terrestrially\u2014albeit using an uncommon mixture of elements by today\u2019s standards\u2014and then incurred damage caused by mechanical and heat stressors,\u201d according to the report .\n\nAfter seeing the analysis, To the Stars released a statement on its website, anticipating a meeting between its own scientists and the ORNL team. In particular, To the Stars is hoping to learn more because \u201cthe reports do not offer a firm conclusion as to the origin and purpose of the material along with other seeming anomalies. [To the Stars] has more questions about both reports.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile we still don\u2019t know exactly where on Earth the mysterious sample came from, all indications show that it belongs to our own planet. There is a likely origin story behind this object\u2014it might be a product of post-WWII magnesium alloy research for lighter and stronger aircraft. Back then, magnesium alloys were poorly understood, according to the report.\n\nMaybe this artifact wasn\u2019t part of a larger piece of technology manufactured by alien hands, or whatever appendages and machines they might use. Still, this was a valuable exercise, because ruling out objects that originated on Earth only gives us a better idea of what really could be extraterrestrial."

        "article_content": "UFO 50 Score Details \u201cUFO 50 will remind you why you fell in love with video games in the first place.\u201d Pros Great commitment to its fiction\n\nSome truly fantastic games\n\nWildly inventive twists\n\nPitch-perfect 8-bit recreations\n\nTons of challenges to chase Cons A handful of duds in the batch\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: UFO 50, the latest game from Spelunky developer Mossmouth, is a fascinating feat. It\u2019s a collection of 50 original 8-bit games that both reference gaming history and iterate on it. Even with a handful of misses in the oddball package, these are lovingly crafted retro throwbacks that encapsulate what made that creative era of gaming so special. It\u2019s also a game that is invested in creating a fiction that its players will buy into. The invented premise is that all of these games were created by a cult classic studio named UFO Soft in the 1980s. It\u2019s a fictional company with very real roots in pioneers like Jeff Minter\u2019s Llamasoft.\n\nTo properly communicate how well UFO 50 builds that fiction, we decided to take a structural swing of our own crafted from the same historical roots. The below review imagines a fictional Digital Trends Magazine, modeled after historic gaming publications like Zzap!64. It is both a review of all 50 games in the collection, as well as a fictional play about three critics that unfolds through their writing over an eight-year span. If you\u2019re just here for a straight recommendation, UFO 50 will give you more value for your buck than any game released in 2024. But if you\u2019re willing to get a little experimental with us, read on.]\n\nHappy New Year, Trendsetters! We have a good feeling that 1992 is going to be a great year for video games, especially with the continued rise of the Super Nintendo. We\u2019ll have plenty of great games to review this year, but before barreling forward, we wanted to take a moment to reflect. Sometimes we\u2019re so focused on the future of tech here at Digital Trends Magazine that we lose sight of the games, developers, and lost eras that brought us so much joy. It\u2019s with that thought that we present a very special issue.\n\nThis year marks the 10-year anniversary of UFO Soft (originally known as LX Systems). The eccentric developer was a staple of the 8-bit era, reaching cult classic status after releasing a barrage of 50 games between 1982 and 1989 on LX home computers. Its wide-ranging catalog represents what we love about video games. The bulk of these games carry an oddball creative spirit. They are not afraid to experiment with new ideas, or iterate on old ones in ways that make them feel brand new. Even its \u201cduds\u201d are at least interesting failures that reach for innovation rather than playing it safe. And all of those games are lovingly crafted with memorable visual and sound design that showcases how expressive 8-bit tech could be.\n\nTo celebrate that achievement, we\u2019ve put together this issue as a comprehensive retrospective on UFO Soft. In these pages, you\u2019ll find every single review we published for the studio\u2019s games over the years. These works paint a picture of a changing era as the shape-shifting joys of gaming\u2019s Wild West days slowly coalesced into repeatable formulas and franchises of rising scale, sometimes to the detriment of even these games.\n\nThis was a great time of change for Digital Trends Magazine, too. Our own writers went through their own transformation during this eight-year span. Their outlooks on art and life morphed alongside these games and the real-world tragedies surrounding them, including the shocking death of one of our own critics. This UFO 50 issue is not just a fun excuse to revisit some old games; it\u2019s a reminder that our worlds are ever-shifting.\n\nOur very own Mark Kemp put it best in his landmark review of Mortol 2: \u201cGames, like lives, are fragile things. Cradle them carefully in your hands as long as you can before they become fading memories.\u201d\n\n~ Amelia Bancroft, Editor in Chief\n\nBarbuta (1982)\n\nArthur Webb: Exploring a winding castle, collecting gold, and dodging devious traps. It all sounds like the recipe for a grand adventure. So then why am I so bored? My gran moves faster than this plodding hero, and the only danger she\u2019s running from is gout! This sprawling play area is too often let down by an overabundance of dead ends and sparse sounds. But I admit, I\u2019m still thinking about this castle\u2019s dense secrets and unexpected tricks even after putting it down. I wish to solve it like a crossword puzzle.\n\nRating: 51%\n\nBug Hunter (1983)\n\nMark Kemp: I\u2019ve slayed more insect baddies than I can count in my life, but never quite like this! Though it took me a few tries to wrap my head around Bug Hunter\u2019s delicate energy and action juggling act, the strategic bug-slaying actions quickly got their hooks in me. With so many special movement and attack patterns to experiment with, all of which change how I manage a lethal grid that fills with evolving nasties on each turn, this is the kind of brainy action you could lose a job to.\n\nRating: 89%\n\nNinpek (1983)\n\nBarty Hughes: Don\u2019t you dare call this another Ninjamania clone! Ninpek brings plenty of new thrills to the trendy action formula. My colourful hero is quite nimble thanks to his second jump (I wish I could do that!), which lets him whiz past enemy attacks as he sends back his shuriken in midair \u2014 just like a real ninja! The use of advanced screen scrolling on the LX just makes that action even more exciting. It\u2019s an easy to learn high-score chase that requires some real discipline to master.\n\nRating: 80%\n\nPaint Chase (1983)\n\nMark Kemp: Paint Chase is a peculiar program that\u2019s more about out-painting rival cars than outracing them. Each level places your car in a small maze, and the goal is to paint as much of the ground as possible by driving over it before the timer runs out. It\u2019s a novel idea helped by a few handy power-ups and nail-biting rounds, but it runs out of gas eventually. For more fun, bring a pal along for some tense two-player battles that are sure to ruin friendships!\n\nRating: 74%\n\nMagic Garden (1984)\n\nBarty Hughes: Aside from showing off the power of the LX-IT\u2019s visual power with its splendid pastel colours, Magic Garden is an otherwise fine program. The player simply walks around a checkered grid picking up blobs, who follow the witch hero like a snake until she drops them off in designated zones to rack up points. It\u2019s pleasant in short bursts, but I can\u2019t say that it fully cast a spell on me! At least these slimes are cute little buggers.\n\nRating: 69%\n\nMortol (1984)\n\nMark Kemp: Death is not the end \u2026 or at least it isn\u2019t in the bloody brilliant Mortol. The player embarks on a dangerous quest to save the world of Mortolia. In order to overcome its obstacles, the player can sacrifice one of their 15 lives to stick into a wall like an arrow, turn into a stone, or explode to take out walls and alien nasties. Each decision will let the next summoned soldier move forward by trampling on the remains of their predecessors. Grim, but morbidly fun! Only by using each life wisely to solve the level like a puzzle can the player reach the finish. It\u2019s a suicide mission you\u2019ll want to go on over and over again!\n\nRating: 90%\n\nVelgress (1984)\n\nArthur Webb: Velgress has it all on paper. It requires precise jumping as the pirate Alpha scrambles up a well full of small footholds that crumble almost instantaneously, while blasting baddies or dodging them with her second jump. And yet, it\u2019s all a bit of a science fiction snoozefest with all the repetitive jumping, lame power-ups that can be bought between levels, and a musical ditty that grates after your hundredth death. I\u2019ll give credit where it\u2019s due, though. The fact that the layout of the well changes with each play makes every attempt feel just a bit new. The programmers may be on to something there.\n\nRating: 61%\n\nPlanet Zoldath (1984)\n\nMark Kemp: I must say, this is one of the more cerebral adventure games I\u2019ve played as of late, even if it\u2019s not the most exciting. This vibrant alien planet is filled with mysterious gizmos, resources that power them, and secret areas that can only be accessed by using the right one. It really feels like I\u2019m learning the ins and outs of a foreign world each time I take another crack at its ever-changing map.\n\nRating: 76%\n\nAttactics (1984)\n\nMark Kemp: Never before has a program captured the epic scale of war as well as Attactics. The tactical battles here, as soldiers automatically march forward every few seconds, make for a brainy game of split-second decision-making. You\u2019ll feel like a general sending your troops to their death! With several distinct unit types, two-player clashes, and even a never-ending mode, this is the total bloody package!\n\nRating: 84%\n\nDevilition (1984)\n\nMark Kemp: Dare I say that LX Systems is becoming devilishly clever? Like Attactics and Bug Hunter, this is another unique strategy game that turns battles against demons into a puzzle. The goal is to rid a checkerboard of beasts by placing down forces with specific attack patterns. Once all are placed to your liking, you choose to detonate one and begin a chain reaction. That is, if you\u2019ve placed your units in the right spot! It\u2019s a bit too hard to keep track of that once I place down a piece, so getting through all 10 boards and protecting the civilians on them requires a lot of concentration. God help you if you accidentally blow a pilgrim to smithereens!\n\nRating: 79%\n\nKick Club (1984)\n\nBarty Hughes: Now here\u2019s a game I can get behind! Football becomes deadly in this famil- friendly sports game where the player kicks their ball to destroy some menacing athletic equipment. It\u2019s an enchanting scenario propped up by pleasant cartoon visuals and jaunty music. It\u2019s perhaps a little too simple to command long-term interest from the tykes, but I\u2019m just glad to be allowed back on the pitch after getting a lifetime ban a few months back (don\u2019t ask!).\n\nRating: 75%\n\nAvianos (1985)\n\nArthur Webb: I can\u2019t make heads or tails of this one \u2026 or should I say beaks or wings? This strategy game imagines a world where birds and dinosaurs have gone to war. I appreciate the idea and the detailed reptile portraits to match it, but its actual battles are a mess. From what I can gather from the unclear instructions and cluttered screen, players take turns gathering resources, summoning monsters, and using them to overtake castles. Oh bother, just devour me already and get it over with!\n\nRating: 55%\n\nMooncat (1985)\n\nArthur Webb: LX Systems has really outdone itself this time. It\u2019s managed to make an adventure game even more frustrating than its dull debut Barbuta. The cryptic art and eerie sounds are enticing, but don\u2019t let those fool you. The strange control scheme and boring level construction aren\u2019t nearly as exciting as its psychedelic world. Don\u2019t bother writing in to complain, Barbuta fans. I\u2019ll send your letters straight to the trash along with this art house rubbish!\n\nRating: 46%\n\nBushido Ball (1985)\n\nBarty Hughes: As far as Pong clones go, you could do worse than this straightforward, but thin offering. The twist is that the paddles are replaced with samurai and ninjas who can trick one another with special shots. That freshens up a tired formula a bit, but not enough to cut through the competition. Hey Arthur, how about you let me take some of those artsy games off your hands next time! Why do I get stuck with all the simple ones these days, huh? Don\u2019t you trust me?\n\nRating: 59%\n\nBlock Koala (1985)\n\nMark Kemp: Don\u2019t let these adorable marsupials mislead you. Koala Park will put your brain to the test. Each stage tasks the player with moving a star block to an end goal, but there are pesky number blocks in the way. Creating a clear path becomes a bit of a math problem, as there are rules to remember. For instance, a block can\u2019t push another if the first one has a smaller number value than the other. It might be too tricky for youngsters (or our own Barty) despite its cutesy visuals, but adults will find a lot of tough challenges to crack.\n\nRating: 75%\n\nCamouflage (1985)\n\nBarty Hughes: Who\u2019s the dumb one now, Mark? Old Barty boy had no trouble at all with this ingenious puzzle game. The player takes control of a friendly chameleon who must evade the sight line of hungry frogs by properly camouflaging to match the coloured environment. The boys didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be smart enough for this one, but joke\u2019s on them! This is an easy to pick up puzzler that oozes with charm. I made it all the way to level 5 even!\n\nRating: 87%\n\nCampanella (1985)\n\nMark Kemp: Imagine your average program where you duck and dodge through a screen full of obstacles. Now, replace your grounded hero with a spaceship that must be piloted with careful precision. That\u2019s what LX Systems delivers with Campanella, perhaps the most tense game since Lunar Lander (which it no doubt draws inspiration from). If you fly into an obstacle, your ship will shatter into a million pieces! I do have a few qualms. I find the little UFO\u2019s slashing action is too short-ranged, and the music and visuals aren\u2019t up to par with LX sci-fi offerings like Planet Zoldath, but the anxious energy kept my palms constantly coated with a layer of sweat.\n\nRating: 77%\n\nGolfaria (1985)\n\nArthur Webb: By now, our most loyal readers likely know that LX Systems has not taken kindly to my reviews over the past few years. I have been dragged through the mud in several of its newsletters, with so-called visionaries like Thorson Petter calling me a \u201chack.\u201d Well add some more hate mail to the pile, because Golfaria is another stinker! As LX so often tends to do, this game overthinks an ambitious adventure by putting players in control of an unwieldy golf ball. I\u2019ll admit that it\u2019s a cutesy idea, but it\u2019s simply a pain to navigate confusing topography before going over a needless \u201cstroke limit\u201d and getting warped back to faraway checkpoints. LX\u2019s inventive design may be its defining quality, but that strength can just as easily be its weakness.\n\nRating: 57%\n\nThe Big Bell Race (1985)\n\nBarty Hughes: Oh, I see how it is. I thought we were all equals here, but no! \u201cCampanella is a high-priority game, Barty! You can\u2019t review it, Barty! Here, why don\u2019t you do the Campanella spinoff racing game that we\u2019re too smart to review instead, Barty!?\u201d Is that how it\u2019s going to be? Well fine. The Big Bell Race is a mediocre racing game hastily built from Campanella\u2019s visuals to capitalize on its instant success. I beat it in 12 minutes. It\u2019s an unremarkable afterthought. I\u2019m starting to know the feeling!\n\nRating: 52%\n\nWarptank (1985)\n\nMark Kemp: This has proved to be a strange year for LX Systems. It may have had a big hit in Campanella, but the company\u2019s offerings have proved divisive. I can\u2019t imagine that anyone will disagree with Warptank. This isn\u2019t just the finest LX offering of 1985; it may just be the best game of this whole year! This mind-bending game has the player controlling a little tank that can warp onto the wall opposite of it. That opens the door for some of the year\u2019s sharpest puzzles. It makes Camouflage look like a baby\u2019s toy!\n\nRating: 88%\n\nWaldorf\u2019s Journey (1986)\n\nBarty Hughes: A walrus game. A bloody Walrus game. Is that all I\u2019m good for? You know, I studied at uni like the rest of these tossers. So what if I didn\u2019t attend Oxford? And alright, I flunked out! But that means I have to review the cartoon animal games now? Well, fine. This is a sweet little program about a sleeping walrus who dreams of leaping through the air and collecting fish. It\u2019s a simple little jumping game that can be tricky to control as the player must hold the jump button to move, but it is elevated by some lovely illustrations and a dreamlike musical ditty. But don\u2019t expect another review like this from me this year! New year, new Barty, I say!\n\nRating: 66%\n\nPorgy (1986)\n\nArthur Webb: Well, well, LX Systems has changed its name to UFO Soft. Now, was that to capitalize on the success of Campanella or to salvage their reputation? No matter, because you can smell the LX stink on Porgy. Sure, this is an improvement over Barbuta and the dreadful Mooncat. This submarine exploration game is suitably tense, as the player must find ship upgrades and then return to base to install them before their fuel runs out. But that\u2019s not without frustration, as persistent enemies like sharks can appear at random and ruin a perfectly good dive. It\u2019s another overworked concept, but I\u2019ll be the bigger man and admit that the sprawling ocean play area and loads of upgrades make for a sizable underwater journey.\n\nRating: 73%\n\nOnion Delivery (1986)\n\nBarty Hughes: How alien it is to be human! That is the thesis of Onion Delivery, a story of an extraterrestrial forced to spend his menial days delivering vegetables around a chaotic city by car. A troglodyte may tell you that this is a simple-minded driving game with poor controls that render it nearly unplayable. But I beg thee, look beneath the hood. Consider the sharp social satire here about how, uh, cars are \u2026 sort of \u2026 weird. Oh, this isn\u2019t working either.\n\nRating: 45%\n\nCaramel Caramel (1986)\n\nMark Kemp: I can already hear Arthur calling this one \u201coverworked.\u201d What a load of codswallop! Well, let me tell you, Caramel Caramel shows the exact thing I enjoy about UFO Soft. This is your standard scrolling spaceship shoot-\u2019em-up, yes. But it makes that idea new again with a camera function that lets the player attack aliens by taking pictures, a bevy of colourful alien planets, and an imaginative alien world. The appeal of games is the way they build on one another\u2019s ideas. It\u2019s a conversation between programmers who are unafraid to be a little silly, try something new, and reinvent themselves. It\u2019s not the most sophisticated product, but who would root against a spirited underdog?\n\nRating: 76%\n\nParty House (1986)\n\nBarty Hughes: This brilliant game about managing a house party is one that\u2019s easy to relate to. Who hasn\u2019t felt like an outcast from the \u201ccool kid\u2019s club\u201d who\u2019s struggling to be let into the party? The goal is simple: throw the ultimate party. To do that, the player collects a set of partygoers, each of which has their own popularity and cash value. Those resources can be used to add more guests to your rolodex or increase the size of the house to invite more guests. All players need to do is open the door to fill the room with guests and amass points to add new ones to the guest list. But watch out! Some guests bring trouble, which can alert the police and shut down the shindig for the night. It\u2019s one of the most clever games UFO Soft has made yet and I simply can\u2019t stop playing it.\n\nRating: 94%\n\nHot Foot (1986)\n\nBarty Hughes: Yet another relatable game from UFO Soft! I guess they must be reading my diary! This is a sports game where children play dodgeball with beanbags. It\u2019s a fine adaptation of the schoolyard game that adds special throws and duos combat, but it\u2019s mostly a shallow little sports game that\u2019s only good for a few plays. Do you know what stands out, though? At the start of each round, you and the computer take turns drafting a team from five students. After four are drafted, the last one is left crying on the sidelines. Very sad, wouldn\u2019t you say, readers?\n\nRating: 59%\n\nDivers (1986)\n\nArthur Webb: Oh hardy har har. The fools at UFO Soft must have read my complaints on Porgy and made a much worse underwater adventure to punish me. This aimless exploration game is burdened by dull turn-taking battles, a confusing shop system, and an environment that feels empty, as impressively detailed as it is. This is where Mark and I disagree. Just because a program is doing something different doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s suddenly worthy of praise. Some things, such as a UFO Soft adventure game, are just destined to be unremarkable, no matter how many times they may change their gimmick!\n\nRating: 58%\n\nRail Heist (1987)\n\nBarty Hughes: I bought a motorcycle. That\u2019s right, I\u2019m a wild man now, just like the gun-toting cowboy in Rail Heist. This strategic heist game has the player stealing cash from train cars while avoiding the sight of gunmen. The twist is that the action happens in turns, so the player has a few seconds to move through the train, knock out guards, hide behind walls, or punch holes in the wall to create faster getaway routes. It takes some time to get the hang of, making it one of UFO Soft\u2019s more expert level games. But it\u2019s no match for a dangerous man like me!\n\nRating: 84%\n\nVainger (1987)\n\nMark Kemp: Readers, I come bearing some sad news. Barty is in the hospital. He got into a motorcycle accident. He is in a coma and the doctors don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll wake up. Arthur and I are stunned. Barty didn\u2019t even know how to ride a motorcycle. I guess he just bought one to impress us.\n\nIt\u2019s all weighing heavily on me, so much so that I can\u2019t even get excited about a spiritual follow-up to the excellent Warptank. This larger iteration takes the gravity-shifting hook and applies it to a shoot-\u2019em-up adventure. It\u2019s a thrilling sci-fi action game filled with secrets and an intriguing mystery, though it loses the elegance of its predecessor in its larger scale. I wish I could enjoy it more right now. But like its hero standing on the ceiling, my world is upside down. Maybe a map would help.\n\nRating: 80%\n\nRock On! Island (1987)\n\nArthur Webb: You know, this is the kind of game that we would have just made Barty do. I would have said it was beneath me. Let that big, old oaf take it so I can handle the big adventure games! Maybe I\u2019ve had it wrong all these years. Rock On! Island is, dare I say \u2026 fun? The player places down cavemen who defend their home from waves of dinosaurs with their automatic attacks. It\u2019s not deep, sure, but the light strategy is refreshing after years of reviewing overly complicated games that I don\u2019t even care for. Maybe there is more joy in a simple, easily communicated idea than I had realized. Barty must understand that. I hope to ask him about it one day.\n\nRating: 75%\n\nPingolf (1987)\n\nMark Kemp: This is a fine miniature golf game. You charge your shot and hit a ball toward a hole while avoiding science-fiction obstacles that look like they were pulled out of Campanella. Lose the intergalactic tournament and you can try again. You don\u2019t need me to tell you if you\u2019ll enjoy it. It does what it says on the package, no more, no less.\n\n(Readers, we have heard you. We, too, miss Barty\u2019s odd sense of humour. There is still no word on his recovery, but we will be starting a new writer in the coming months to bring some levity back to this magazine. You will be seeing a lot of him soon, as Arthur has opted to take a sabbatical for the next few months. He says he needs to find himself. Bear with me as I run the show alone for the next month or so.)\n\nRating: 61%\n\nMortol 2 (1987)\n\nMark Kemp: I\u2019ve been thinking about death a lot recently. Not just human death, though that weighs heavy on my mind too. But this video game world is itself always in a cycle of death. Home consoles live out their lives and then fade away. Development studios have their meteoric rises, but we know they will not be around forever. Even franchises like Mortol no doubt have an expiration date. It is too easy to take for granted that this 8-bit era \u2014 its games and its stars, like UFO Soft \u2014 will leave us one day. We will cherish them later in life, looking back on them with fond nostalgia, but it is so easy to forget that in the moment. We must soak in this era of inventive play, one that fights back the tide of commercialization. We must hold on to the strange, quirky games we love, for they will die 100 deaths before we know it.\n\nMortol 2 is a reminder of that truth. In this adventure, the player must navigate a map full of traps and demons, but they only have 100 lives to do it. Like in the first Mortol, these heroes can be sacrificed to help the ones that come later to navigate. One turns into a platform upon their demise. Another leaves behind a teleporter. Each death is a reminder of what came before; lost lives that paved a path for the future. It\u2019s maddeningly difficult, often to a fault, but there is truth in this somber scenario. Let the dead be a monument. Let them be a persistent reminder to embrace the present while it is here. Games, like lives, are fragile things. Cradle them carefully in your hands as long as you can before they become fading memories.\n\nRating: 83%\n\nFist Hell (1987)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky! Wacky Jerry reporting in for duty all the way from the U.S. of A! Honk honk! I\u2019m new to the team, but I just know we\u2019re going to have fun together! Now, I hope you didn\u2019t just eat, because Fist Hell will make you puke \u2014 in a good way! This gross-out beat-\u2019em-up has you pummeling zombies and werewolves up and down the city streets with your deep arsenal of attacks. It\u2019s like having a Hollywood action movie in your hands. There\u2019s so much blood \u2026 it\u2019s awesome!!! No more of this sci-fi crud or boring puzzles. This is the future of games!!\n\nRating: 85%\n\nOverbond (1987)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky! Say goodbye to boring old Velgress and say hello to Overbond. This sequel cuts out all the crap like jumping. Instead, the bounty hunter Alpha gets dropped in an arena and she has to survive eight battles against enemies, all while collecting money to upgrade her gear between fights. Best of all? She has a gun! It\u2019s all like POW POW! And then you drop a bomb and they EXPLODE. It\u2019s crazy!!! I wish there were more kinds of guns and blood and stuff, but I think the \u201cshooter\u201d game is going to be big, you watch. I wish every game was like this!\n\nRating: 74%\n\nCampanella 2 (1987)\n\nMark Kemp: Something is changing. I can feel it. Games are getting bigger, more spectacular, but more templatized too. Compare Campanella to its new sequel. The original was a concise concept built on a simple tension. Campanella 2 is bigger. There are on-foot shooting segments, upgrades, and a vast world to explore. It should feel grander. It does, sometimes. But why, I ask, does it feel narrower too? It\u2019s as if UFO Soft\u2019s eclectic vision is all funneling toward one \u201caction-adventure\u201d bucket? What is happening to imaginative games like Bug Hunter or Warptank? Is there still hope that the underdogs can survive?\n\nPlease wake up, Barty.\n\nRating: 73%\n\nHyper Contender (1988)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky! Hyper Contender is chock-full of action! This fighting game has players beating the snot, and rings, out of one another! The first to get five rings wins the match, so it\u2019s not just about who\u2019s better at punching. That\u2019s a radical spin on the fighting game, even if there aren\u2019t too many modes or characters here. But what I really love is that this game features characters from a bunch of other UFO Soft games! Isn\u2019t that so cool?? Give me more, more, more of my favorite characters please!!\n\nRating: 74%\n\nValbrace (1988)\n\nMark Kemp: This fantasy adventure has shades of classic maze games like 3D Monster Maze, but with more modern RPG touches that you\u2019d see in something like Gauntlet. The player crawls through a labyrinthian dungeon full of traps in search of valuable treasure. It\u2019s a basic concept, but it replaces turn-based encounters against monsters with real-time slashing. It\u2019s a more fast-paced spin on an old formula that fits with UFO Soft\u2019s push toward more mechanically sophisticated action. Won\u2019t Mr. Wack Job be happy to hear it \u2026\n\nRating: 76%\n\nRakshasa (1988)\n\nArthur Webb: Namaste, readers. Where have I been the past few months? Well, where haven\u2019t I been? I have cleansed my soul in the waters of the world. I feel refreshed, born anew. How fitting is it, then, that my first task upon returning is writing about the great Rakshasa? At first, this feels similar to the side-scrolling high-score action of Ninpek, but there\u2019s a hopeful twist. Every time the hero dies, their spirit pops out. By dodging enemies and collecting shards, they can bring themselves back to life. It is a game of second, third, and even fourth chances. It posits that there is always hope that we may wipe the slate clean and come back anew. Perhaps I am not fated to become an old grump. And maybe this era of 8-bit games does not have to end with the advent of 16-bit fast approaching. Maybe it too can rise again, a reinvented version of itself crafted by developers who care enough to return to this style of game-making with new ideas. I hope to see that day.\n\nRating: 82%\n\nStar Waspir (1988)\n\nMark Kemp: This space shoot-\u2019em-up is par for the course. Fly a ship through the air, blast baddies, rack up a high score. Its sole innovation is that the enemies drop power-up blocks, with the player needing to collect three. And the ability they ultimately get is determined by which blocks they collect. That adds some mix-and-match potential that upgrades each of the three ships with additional tools like helper drones or more powerful shots. It\u2019s a smaller twist than UFO Soft usually delivers on familiar formulas. Maybe it\u2019s running short on ideas. It must be exhausting to keep this kind of creative pace up. (Sigh, after turning in this draft, the powers-that-be here asked me to include a \u201csecond opinion\u201d from Jerry.)\n\nWacky Jerry: POW! POW! POW! Isn\u2019t it so cool when you get to blast spaceships and watch them explode in fiery glory?? I say, don\u2019t listen to Mark! He\u2019s such a drag! Buy this game today from your local Electro-Mart! Shop today and save 15% off* on a purchase of an LX-III! And don\u2019t forget to spank my butt and call me wacky!\n\n*Terms and conditions apply, see in-store for details.\n\nMark\u2019s Rating: 69%\n\nJerry\u2019s Rating: 90%\n\nGrimstone (1988)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky! OK, so you know those lame-o Dragon Quest games? Well what if I told you they made them cool? Grimstone is basically that game but with cowboys and guns! You shoot bandits and monsters in turn-based battles where you need to press a button at the right time to hit. There are tons of towns to explore, horses to ride, and more. It\u2019s a full-on Western fantasy! I\u2019m so glad to see UFO Soft making more games with American sensibilities! Yee-haw partner!!!\n\nRating: 82%\n\nLords of Diskonia (1988)\n\nMark Kemp: Finally, UFO Soft makes a return to the innovative strategy games I came to love them for in 1982. This creative wargame imagines troops as discs that can be flung into one another. Battles see the player bouncing off their foes\u2019 discs to damage them, sending them retreating to their camp to restock. The goal is to eventually overtake their camp after winning battles and pushing them back enough, all while using gold to hire more troops. Perhaps it speaks to me so much because sometimes it feels like we\u2019re always fighting a war in the world of games. There is a push and pull between creativity and safety. More and more, the latter seems to be winning. Games are settling into formulas. The enthusiasts who refuse to question it gain control of the battlefield. The people who care fall one by one. All these forces ricochet into one another, but I fear that it\u2019s the ones with the most gold who will stand tall at the end of the day. What will we lose when the frontlines of creativity fall?\n\nRating: 89%\n\nNight Manor (1988)\n\nWacky Jerry: Well, spank my butt and call me wacky because I\u2019ve got some great news to share today! I\u2019ve been promoted to lead reviewer! Apparently, our bosses love how excited I sound about every game in all my reviews! I\u2019m going to celebrate hard tonight, but first let\u2019s talk about Night Manor because this game is tubular! This is a point-and-click horror game (ew, I know, reading), and it is totally awesome. The story will keep you on the edge of your seat and the atmosphere is total creepsville. And it\u2019s so freaky and bloody! Your parents are gonna flip!\n\nRating: 85%\n\nElfazar\u2019s Hat (1988)\n\nArthur Webb: Well, I\u2019m not sure how to say this, but I\u2019m sad \u2014 well more puzzled, I suppose \u2014 to report that Jerimiah Johnson (or Wacky Jerry, as you know him) has passed away. I guess his promotion celebration went awry. Something about a deep-fried turkey and a fireworks snafu. I\u2019ll spare you the details. I have sent word to the elders of Aswan, who I lodged with during my travels to Egypt. With their blessing, may he be born anew in the waters of the Nile.\n\nThere\u2019s no real elegant way to transition to a review of a game about cute animals escaping the clutches of an evil wizard, is there? Well, then I\u2019ll just say that this is a charming little adventure that iterates on Star Waspir\u2019s power-up matching system. This feels like a far more fully realized version of that project, as it combines shoot-\u2019em-up play with a more traditional level-based adventure. It is further proof that a boorish game can get a second life as something vibrant and delightful. I\u2019m sure Jerry would have loved it.\n\nOn second thought, I haven\u2019t the slightest clue. I\u2019m not even sure he played the games he reviewed.\n\nRating: 76%\n\nPilot Quest (1988)\n\nArthur Webb: Now, this is something. Imagine a program that you barely have to play at all. That is the conceit of Pilot Quest, a sort of automation game about a spaceman who crash-lands on an alien planet. First, I must smack a crystal to gather some moon resources. But soon, I spend them to create a few plants that automatically produce crystals every second. After a bit of setup, I don\u2019t need to play at all. I leave my LX-III running in the background until I have enough to set up my next task, culminating in me repairing my ship. Occasionally, I can enter a zone for a few minutes to smack enemies with my yo-yo and obtain supplies, but I have gotten so much done as it played itself. I went for a walk. I watched the Goldfinches flutter merrily. What real adventures have I been missing all these years while trudging through digital ones? Like my little spaceman, I yearn for escape.\n\nRating: 78%\n\nMini & Max (1989)\n\nMark Kemp: When Mini & Max begins, I am a little girl locked in a tiny storage room. I can barely move. But soon, my dog, Max, shows me a trick. By holding the down button, I shrink to the size of a bug. Suddenly, that tiny room becomes a sprawling metropolis full of stars to collect, dust bunnies to aid, and abilities that make the world feel even bigger. As an 8-bit game that feels like the last of a dying breed (especially as I hear that Sega\u2019s fancy 16-bit console may be coming to more countries imminently), Mini & Max is a revelation. It is a reminder that there is infinite depth in even the smallest things. These pixel games may seem limited, but UFO Soft continues to show us how boundless they are. Just when it feels like we\u2019ve hit the bottom, we discover a whole subatomic level of design decisions. There is more to explore in this 8-bit world. Why, I wonder, are we so eager to leave uncharted territory behind?\n\nRating: 90%\n\nCombatants (1989)\n\nMark Kemp: Since its second game, UFO Soft have long been obsessed with war. Combatants once again explores that idea, but at an insect level. The player controls an army of ants with a list of commands. They can summon workers to spawn more creepy-crawlies, send them into battle, or tell them to fall back. Rushing in without a plan is a surefire way to lose. These missions are frustrating. You\u2019ll want to throw your controller out the window and give up. But with patience and strategy, there is hope for survival.\n\nOh, I wasn\u2019t going to say this. I fear I\u2019ll jinx it, but \u2026 I visited Barty over the weekend and I swore I saw his eyes flutter. They fluttered! The doctor told me not to get too excited. His condition is unpredictable. I know I should be measured, but I feel a surge of hope. My sweet friend. My eccentric pal, so full of life and spirit. Will you wake up once more? Will you bring back what I was so sure we had lost? For the first time in ages, it feels as though we may win this war yet.\n\nRating: 62%\n\nQuibble Race (1989)\n\nArthur Webb: Readers, forgive me if this week\u2019s writing is sloppy. Mark has gone to be with Barty and I am taking on his work for this issue. I have also consumed a fair amount of opium this week. In any case, Quibble Race is a psychedelic alien racing game that continues UFO Soft\u2019s newfound automation experiments. You do not control your alien racer here. Rather, you bet on a winner, give them illegal boosters, and sabotage your opponents. Perhaps it is just the purple albatross with great wings of water speaking through me, but the less and less I actually have to play these games, the more at peace I become. Peculiar.\n\nRating: 65%\n\nSeaside Drive (1989)\n\nMark Kemp: Yes, yes, Seaside Drive is a blast. It is a brilliant driving-action hybrid in which players shoot at enemies from their convertible while drifting along a highway to charge their weapon\u2019s power. It\u2019s a simple, fun shoot-\u2019em-up concept with great high-score-chasing potential. I don\u2019t mean to rush through it, but I have more important news to share.\n\nI was sitting by Barty\u2019s side on a warm Sunday afternoon. A light beam poked in from the window and warmed his face. As I looked at him, bathed in angelic light, it happened. He woke up. His pupils were red and tired, but I could see that light shining through.\n\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d he said weakly. I could barely speak. My lips too stunned to move.\n\n\u201cBarty. You \u2026 there was \u2026 an accident. You\u2019ve been \u2026 asleep \u2026 for two years.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me, trying to process this, his head ever so slightly cocked to the side.\n\n\u201cDid Campanella 2 come out?\u201d he asked me, his sense of goofball humour awakening before his body.\n\n\u201cBarty,\u201d I said through tears, \u201cThey\u2019re about to release Campanella 3. And I want you to review it.\u201d\n\nRating: 83%\n\nCampanella 3 (1989)\n\nBarty Hughes: In my dreams, I saw UFOs.\n\nIsn\u2019t that something? Bloody UFOs! I don\u2019t remember much about being unconscious for two years, but I remember seeing those little pink buggers flying about. I was afraid they would shatter, as they so easily do in Campanella, but they never did. There were no walls for them to smash against in my dreams. There was only black space stretching to infinity. They could fly on forever.\n\nMark tells me that Campanella 3 is nothing like Campanella 2 even though it features that blasted UFO. I hear it shares more in common with a game called Seaside Drive (oh dear, I have a lot of catching up to do, don\u2019t I?). Mark seemed a bit peeved that the tense ship-flying of the past two games had gone away in favor of a shoot-\u2019em-up with a 3D scrolling trick. Well, that doesn\u2019t bother me very much! I think this is a fun little jolt of action, simple as it may be. And anyways, why would I want to play the same old thing again? I\u2019d be cross if I came out of a bloody coma only to play the same game again!\n\nWhen I told Mark that, he looked surprised. We got to talking and he told me that he\u2019s just afraid that everything is changing. He doesn\u2019t know where games are going with this 16-bit world coming, and he hears rumors that UFO Soft may be on the verge of closing its doors soon. I told him he worries too much! It\u2019s not like his memories of the 8-bit age are going to shatter when the Sega system comes to the United Kingdom! You don\u2019t have to lock the past in a storage closet full of junk to crash into. Let those UFOs loose into the night sky where they belong. They\u2019ll always wave down to us with their blinking lights.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe they\u2019ll touch down on Earth again once they\u2019ve explored the deepest reaches of space and find something new to show us!\n\nRating: 81%\n\nCyber Owls (1989)\n\nArthur Webb: It\u2019s the end of the world as we know it and only a gang of militarized owls can save it. Cyber Owls takes the player through four missions with very different playstyles, from a standard beat-\u2019em-up to a motorbike chase to a top-down stealth infiltration segment. It\u2019s action-packed, it\u2019s fun, and it\u2019s the last game I will ever review.\n\nYes, I am retiring, dear reader, to pursue a new career in bird conservation. The Cyber Owls may defend the world from harm, but who will protect the real owls in our own world? Don\u2019t let anyone tell you there\u2019s no such thing as second chances \u2014 especially me! As the great wise men of Chaukhamba once told me, resurrection is not so much a miracle as it is a trust that even the simplest things contain an infinite capacity for reinvention. There may yet be a future within the past. Or something like that. Namaste, readers. May you rise anew one day.\n\nRating: 80%\n\nIn loving memory of Jerimiah \u201cWacky Jerry\u201d Johnson."

        "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nBack on August 4, 1990, two men were northwest of Perth in Calvine, just on the edge of Scotland\u2019s Cairngorms National Park, when they snapped a photo of a UFO that became known as the \u201cCalvine Photograph.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cCalvine Photograph\u201d has gone on to be called by some, the most spectacular UFO picture ever captured.\n\nThe photos the men took were turned over to Scotland\u2019s Daily Record newspaper who then gave them to Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defense (MoD).\n\nFor over 30 years, the infamous UFO photos were never published and never made them available to the public, and were considered to be lost until 2023.\n\nAndrew Robinson, a senior lecturer in photography at Sheffield Hallam University, who examined the \u201cCalvine Photograph,\u201d said after examining it last year, \u201cMy conclusion is that the object is definitely in front of the camera, that is, it\u2019s not a fake produced in post-production, and its placement within the scene appears to be approximately halfway between the foreground fence and the plane in the background.\u201d\n\nNo one, however, has ever been able to discern exactly what the UFO in the photographs actually was. At least not until now. Maybe.\n\n\u201cLuckily I have recently had access to retired CID Officer John Hanson\u2019s UFO archive in Stratford Upon Avon. It\u2019s a treasure trove of UFO sightings going back to the 1940\u2019s,\u201d said UFO researcher and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee.\n\n\u201cFrom going through all these documents there seems to have been a lot of sightings of diamond shaped crafts since the 1970\u2019s and especially around UK military bases.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a connection \u2013 is the Calvine UFO a secret military technology either of ours or an adversary that has been kept secret? Why is this diamond shaped craft seemingly accompanied by military jets?\u201d\n\nAnother researcher who has inspected the photos, Mike Bara, offers a slightly different take.\n\n\u201cWhat you are looking at here is not a flying UFO, but something else,\u201d Bara recently stated. \u201cThe Calvine UFO lines up with the mountain in the background perfectly. So what happened?\n\n\u201cI think it is pretty obvious what happened. There was an inverted cloud layer here, fog, down on the ground in the valley, probably right up to the fence and they took a picture of the Harrier Jet, which was streaking around for whatever reason, maybe doing exercises, and the peak of this background mountain was sticking through the clouds, probably at about 2,500 feet.\n\n\u201cTwo guys took a picture of a Harrier and then realized there looked like there was a UFO and probably thought why don\u2019t we turn it into the press to maybe get some money. The Calvine UFO is not a UFO, it is not a flying object. I understand that for some people this is going to be hard to take but you have to go where the evidence goes. We can say the Calvine UFO mystery is solved.\u201d\n\nBut has it really been solved?\n\nThe two men who took the Calvine photographs have never been identified and the MoD suspiciously says they won\u2019t be revealing their names anytime before the year 2076, citing \u201cprivacy concerns.\u201d Why?"

        "article_content": "Microsoft is unveiling new features in its $30 per user Microsoft 365 Copilot monthly subscriptions that are designed to improve AI integration inside of Office apps. Excel is getting Python integration inside of Copilot, PowerPoint has an improved AI-powered narrative builder, Word is getting better at AI-assisted drafts, and Copilot will be able to help you organize your Outlook inbox, too.\n\nAfter bringing Python to Excel last year, Microsoft is now combining its Python support with Copilot to let Excel users easily perform advanced analysis on spreadsheet data. \u201cNow, anyone can work with Copilot to conduct advanced analysis like forecasting, risk analysis, machine learning, and visualizing complex data \u2014 all using natural language, no coding required,\u201d says Jared Spataro, corporate vice president of AI at work at Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s like adding a skilled data analyst to the team.\u201d\n\nThe Copilot and Python integration inside of Excel enters public preview today, just as Microsoft makes Copilot in Excel generally available to its Microsoft 365 Copilot subscribers. Microsoft has also added Copilot support for XLOOKUP and SUMIF, conditional formatting, and the ability for the AI assistant to produce more charts and PivotTables.\n\nCopilot in PowerPoint is also getting improvements, with an improved narrative builder that\u2019s designed to let you quickly create a first draft of a slide deck. The AI assistant will even soon use a company\u2019s branded template to create drafts or company-approved images from SharePoint libraries.\n\nCopilot in Microsoft Teams will summarize conversations that happened in the text chat as well as spoken ones in meetings later this month. This will help meeting organizers make sure they didn\u2019t miss any unanswered questions that were typed into the chat. \u201cOur customers tell us Copilot in Teams has changed meetings forever \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the number one place they\u2019re seeing value,\u201d says Spataro.\n\nCopilot is getting more useful inside of Outlook inboxes. Image: Microsoft\n\nI\u2019ve personally been waiting for improvements to Copilot in Outlook beyond drafting and summaries, and now Microsoft is starting to allow its AI assistant to organize your inbox. A new \u201cprioritize my inbox\u201d feature lets Copilot automatically prioritize emails. Later this year, you\u2019ll also be able to \u201cteach Copilot the specific topics, keywords, or people that are important to you,\u201d according to Spataro. These emails will then also be marked as high priority in your inbox.\n\nLater this month, Microsoft is also improving Copilot in Word to let you reference data from emails and meetings, alongside data from documents. This will make it easier to bring in attachments from emails or entire talking points from meetings. Microsoft is also rolling out Copilot in OneDrive later this month, making it easy to summarize and compare up to five files to spot differences between them.\n\nOneDrive\u2019s file comparison tool. Image: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s improvements to Copilot in Office are designed to make the AI assistant more enticing to businesses, alongside a new Copilot Pages feature and AI agents that will automate certain tasks. Recent reports have suggested there has been a lukewarm reception to Microsoft\u2019s paid Copilot version for businesses, due to bugs and a reluctance to pay the $30 per user price."

        "article_content": "If you're looking for ways to improve your writing skills, look no further than AI. Keeping AI in my writer toolbox helps me overcome writer\u2019s block while allowing me to focus on content without distractions. AI can be useful to organize your ideas, clarify complex thoughts and ensure accurate grammar.\n\n\n\nMost creatives know that, when it comes to AI, you get out what you put in. Meaning, you shouldn\u2019t simply give the AI your ideas and expect it to come up with a masterpiece. Let me assure you, letting AI take over completely is not the way to effectively use it in your creative endeavors.\n\nInstead, consider AI to be a writing partner; use it to brainstorm ideas, come up with an outline, or tackle an ending. I\u2019ve personally used it to help shape stories, reduce review cycles, and even confirm I\u2019m writing for the appropriate reading level.\n\n\n\nTo develop your writing skills and get your ideas off the ground, I encourage you to give my favorite AI writing apps a try. You may be surprised how AI may improve your writing, while also opening up new ways to spark creativity.\n\n1. Grammarly\n\n(Image credit: Grammarly)\n\nGrammarly is a must-have AI tool that works across a variety of platforms such as Windows, Microsoft Edge, iPhone, iPad, and Android. I use it often because I appreciate the writing suggestions and corrections. In particular, I value Grammarly's input on sentence structure, word usage, and punctuation.\n\nDesigned to support your writing skills, the AI uses a variety of methods like machine learning and deep learning, to help users communicate easily and clearly. Once you add it to your platform of choice, it will automatically assist as you write.\n\nThe free version offers limited suggestions, so going Pro is the better option if you\u2019re serious about producing your best work every time.\n\n2. Squibler\n\n(Image credit: Amanda Caswell screenshot)\n\nFor serious writers hoping to start or finish the novel inside of them, Squibler can be a much-needed writing companion. I like it because it helps keep me on track with goal tracking and book management.\n\nI have also found the visual generation and split screen incredibly helpful when diligently working through big ideas. The chapter-by-chapter snapshot keeps wordcount in check as I target approaching deadlines. I should emphasize that this is a writing companion and not an AI tool that will write your novel for you\u2014where\u2019s the fun in that, anyway? As with similar novel writing AI apps, Squibler is there for support, not to do the bulk of the work for you.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n3. Essay Genius\n\n(Image credit: Amanda Caswell screenshot)\n\nIn college I wrote a 110-page thesis on the works of Emily Dickenson. I distinctly remember the internet being so much like the Wild West that a librarian once told me not to trust any website that had a \u201csquiggly line\u201d in the address.\n\nKnowing now that something as easy-to-use as Essay Genius is free for anyone to use, made me even more intrigued. I like the simplistic setup of the website. Immediately upon landing on the home page, users are asked what they are writing about; after entering your topic, you\u2019ll get an essay in 60 seconds or less.\n\nAlthough the results are extremely well written, it should not be your finished product. Essay Genius is there to help form your ideas and structure your thoughts; like a virtual bungee cord for overflowing thoughts that need configuration.\n\n4. Jasper\n\n(Image credit: Amanda Caswell screenshot)\n\nJasper is a helpful professional AI writing tool. It\u2019s great for writing team bios, optimization of blog posts, and helping your company voice stay on brand.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re a marketing manager who hires freelancers to write promotional posts, Jasper can ensure that each post has the right tone, no matter which freelancer wrote the post in question.\n\nJasper uses multiple AI models to help you grow traffic to your site, create faster marketing campaigns, and save time. As a browser extension, it is \u201calways on\u201d as the ultimate AI writing assistant.\n\n5. Writer\n\n(Image credit: Amanda Caswell screenshot)\n\nThis app with a bold name deserves endless praise. In my opinion, Writer is among the best for accuracy and security. Ideal for assisting with regulatory and legal manuals, emails, and more, this AI tool is a must for professionals.\n\nMost recently, Writer has integrated with Slack, to automate workflows. I have personally used it to draft up bylaws for local committees and summarize \u201csmall print\u201d in large purchases.\n\nThe Writer home page offers a variety of resources including webinars, product tours, and a podcast.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nThese five apps are my favorite AI writing tools to assist with everything from accuracy to speed when creating content. When I use AI in my writing, I find that I am even more creative because AI does the heavy lifting on everything I don\u2019t particularly like, such as crafting an outline, perfecting grammar, checking wordcount, or staying on track.\n\nWith AI as my assistant, I can focus on writing, creativity, and letting my thoughts flow. Students and professionals alike can benefit from integrating AI writing apps into their daily writing strategies. All of the aforementioned tools offer free options, but I have found that going Pro on my favorite AI writing apps is absolutely worth it."

A brand-new key visual, five new cast members, and three exciting teaser trailers were revealed, giving audiences a deeper look into the action-packed, paranormal world that awaits.\n\nThe teasers each highlight a different facet of DAN DA DAN, diving into the anime\u2019s unique blend of battle, romance, and the occult. First up is the \u201cBattle\u201d trailer, spotlighting an intense showdown between protagonist Okarun and the eerie Flatwoods Monster.

Science SARU (known most recently for their work on Scott Pilgrim Takes Off) leads the animation, while Kensuke Ushio (Tengoku Daimakyo, The Heike Story) composes the soundtrack.\n\nThe hype doesn\u2019t stop there \u2014 DAN DA DAN made a global splash even before its TV debut with a limited-time theatrical release, DAN DA DAN: First Encounter. The anime premiered across 50 countries, including screenings in Southeast Asia, Europe, North America, and more, with an enthusiastic reception from fans worldwide.\n\nBased on Yukinobu Tatsu\u2019s hit manga, first serialised on Shueisha\u2019s Shonen Jump+ in April 2021, the series has since released 15 volumes, with a 16th slated for 4 October 2024. The manga, localised in English by VIZ Media, is already a massive hit, and now, with the anime\u2019s arrival, DAN DA DAN is poised to bring its supernatural charm to an even wider audience.\n\nBoth Crunchyroll and Netflix will stream the anime outside Japan, giving fans everywhere a chance to dive into the wild world of DAN DA DAN."
