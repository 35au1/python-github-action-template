These include technical issues, such as the need for large computational resources, and ethical concerns surrounding the use of AI in decision-making processes.\n\nData Privacy and Security\n\nAI systems rely on vast amounts of data, often including sensitive personal information. Ensuring data privacy and security is one of the primary concerns in AI Engineering. Engineers must design systems that not only comply with regulations but also protect user data from breaches and misuse.\n\nBias in AI Systems\n\nAI models learn from the data they are trained on, and if that data is biased, the AI system will likely exhibit similar biases. This can lead to unfair treatment of certain groups, especially in applications such as hiring, lending, and law enforcement. Addressing bias in AI is a major focus for engineers, as fairness and ethical responsibility are critical for building trustworthy systems.\n\nJob Displacement\n\nAs AI systems automate tasks traditionally performed by humans, concerns over job displacement are rising. While AI Engineering creates new opportunities in areas such as AI development, data science, and system maintenance, it also poses challenges in terms of workforce adaptation. Engineers must balance the drive for innovation with the broader impact of AI on society.\n\nThe Future of AI Engineering\n\nAI Engineering is evolving rapidly, and its impact on industries and society is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Future advancements will likely focus on creating more efficient, transparent, and ethical AI systems. Engineers will continue to refine algorithms, enhance computational power, and address the ethical challenges associated with AI.\n\nAdditionally, the rise of explainable AI (XAI) aims to make AI systems more transparent by allowing humans to understand how decisions are made. This is particularly important in areas such as healthcare and finance, where accountability and trust are paramount. As AI Engineering advances, it will undoubtedly shape the future of technology, creating new possibilities for businesses and individuals alike.\n\nConclusion\n\nAI Engineering plays a pivotal role in building advanced AI systems that are transforming industries and improving daily life. From healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment, AI systems are solving complex problems and driving innovation. However, these systems also present unique challenges that must be addressed, such as ensuring data privacy, reducing bias, and balancing the societal impacts of automation. As AI continues to evolve, AI engineers will remain at the forefront, shaping a future where AI becomes an integral part of our everyday lives."

These peculiar noises, known as \"biotwang,\" resemble sci-fi starship sounds and are thought to be vocalizations used by the whales to communicate and locate one another in the vast ocean. The biotwang serves a function similar to a game of Marco Polo, where the whales call out to establish their positions.This discovery sheds light on the complexities of marine communication and the fascinating behaviors of deep-sea creatures , emphasizing the importance of understanding how these animals interact in their underwater environment.The unusual sounds were first detected in 2014 during an acoustic survey of the Mariana Trench, which stretches over 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometres) south of Japan and reaches depths of 35,876 feet (10,935 metres). The biotwang consists of two distinct components: a deep, grumbling reverberation and a high-pitched, metallic ringing that has drawn comparisons to spaceship sounds in popular sci-fi franchises like Star Trek and Star Wars.Initially, the origin of these sounds puzzled scientists. By 2016, researchers speculated that the biotwang might be produced by large baleen whales, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) or humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), but none of the calls matched known whale sounds.As per the recent study, researchers have definitively linked the biotwang to Bryde's whales, aided by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools that analysed over 200,000 hours of audio data from various ocean recordings. The breakthrough came when the team observed a group of Bryde's whales swimming near the Mariana Islands and recorded nine of them producing the distinctive noise. Lead author Ann Allen, an oceanographer at NOAA's Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, noted, \"Once, it's a coincidence. Twice is happenstance. Nine times, it's definitely a Bryde's whale.\"To conclusively establish that Bryde's whales were the source of the biotwang, researchers correlated the timing of the calls with the whales' migration patterns, analysing years of audio captured by monitoring stations in the Mariana Archipelago and surrounding areas. They utilised AI to convert the biotwang into visual representations called spectrograms, which allowed a machine learning algorithm to differentiate these sounds from others.The findings indicated that biotwang was predominantly detected in the northwest Pacific, suggesting that a specific population of Bryde's whales is responsible for the calls, even though the species inhabits a much broader range. Interestingly, the data revealed an increase in biotwang sounds during 2016, coinciding with an El Ni\u00f1o event that raised ocean temperatures and attracted more Bryde's whales to the region.While the exact reason for the bizarre nature of these calls remains unclear, researchers hypothesise that the biotwang functions as a contact call, helping whales locate each other in the vast ocean. Allen stated, \"It's possible that they use the biotwang as a contact call, a sort of 'Marco Polo' of the ocean,\" emphasising the need for further research to confirm this theory."

Project management software is both driving this change and benefiting from it. While the trend of collaborative work management has been strong for a while, the Covid pandemic has definitively accelerated the demand for tools that allow work to be done remotely.\n\nThe 4 project management software stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line.\n\nThe Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\n\nIn light of this news, project management software stocks have held steady with share prices up 2.6% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nAsana (NYSE:ASAN)\n\nFounded in 2008 by Facebook\u2019s co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, Asana (NYSE:ASAN) is a cloud-based project management software, where you can plan and assign tasks to employees and monitor and discuss progress of work.\n\nAsana reported revenues of $179.2 million, up 10.3% year on year. This print was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, but overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with a miss of analysts\u2019 billings estimates and full-year revenue guidance missing analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\n\u201cIn Q2, Asana continued to execute on our enterprise transition and make significant strides in AI. We're seeing momentum in key areas, including 17% growth in customers spending over $100,000, success in key verticals, and a record number of multi-year deals,\u201d said Dustin Moskovitz, co-founder and chief executive officer of Asana.\n\nAsana Total Revenue\n\nAsana delivered the slowest revenue growth of the whole group. The company added 786 enterprise customers paying more than $5,000 annually to reach a total of 22,948. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 7.2% since reporting and currently trades at $12.32.\n\nRead our full report on Asana here, it\u2019s free.\n\nBest Q2: Monday.com (NASDAQ:MNDY)\n\nFounded in Israel in 2014, and named after the dreaded first day of the work week, Monday.com (NASDAQ:MNDY) makes software as a service platform that helps teams plan and track work efficiently.\n\nStory continues\n\nMonday.com reported revenues of $236.1 million, up 34.4% year on year, outperforming analysts\u2019 expectations by 3%. The business had a strong quarter with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates and full-year revenue guidance topping analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nMonday.com Total Revenue\n\nMonday.com scored the biggest analyst estimates beat, fastest revenue growth, and highest full-year guidance raise among its peers. The company added 222 enterprise customers paying more than $50,000 annually to reach a total of 2,713. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 21.3% since reporting. It currently trades at $273.83.\n\nIs now the time to buy Monday.com?

It was a slower quarter as it posted underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and management forecasting growth to slow.\n\nAtlassian delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and weakest full-year guidance update in the group. As expected, the stock is down 7% since the results and currently trades at $161.19.\n\nRead our full analysis of Atlassian\u2019s results here.\n\nSmartsheet (NYSE:SMAR)\n\nFounded in 2005, Smartsheet (NYSE:SMAR) is a software as a service platform that helps companies plan, manage and report on work.\n\nSmartsheet reported revenues of $276.4 million, up 17.3% year on year.

The stock is up 3.4% since reporting and currently trades at $51.01.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Smartsheet here, it\u2019s free.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.
