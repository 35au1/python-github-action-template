        "article_content": "With all the horrifying moments in Silent Hill 2 Remake, it is nice that the two classic joke endings from the original game. One of these endings is the \u201cUFO\u201d Ending which is a running joke that has appeared in many of the series\u2019 entries. While this version of the UFO Ending is slightly different from the original, players will still want to know how to reach this humorous conclusion. This guide will show players how to get the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake.\n\nMore Silent Hill 2 Remake Guides\n\nFull Achievement and Trophy List | How Long Is Silent Hill 2 Remake? | How To Get All Guns & Special Weapons | How to Get the Handgun | How to Get the Shotgun | How to Get the Hunting Rifle | Pyramid Head Boss Fight Guide | Flesh Lip Boss Fight Guide | Abstract Daddy Boss Fight Guide | Eddie Boss Fight Guide | Dual Pyramid Heads Boss Fight Guide | Final Boss Fight Guide | All Number Locks & Keypad Solutions | How To Unlock Every Classic Ending | Secrets Guide | How To Unlock Two New Secret Endings\n\nHow to Get the \u201cUFO\u201d Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake\n\nTo get the UFO Ending, you will first need to beat the game at least once and then go through it all again in New Game+. During New Game+, new items will appear throughout the game, including special ones that are required to get special endings like the UFO one.\n\nYou will need to use the Blue Gem item at designated locations to get the UFO ending. This Gem is found just a little north of the top right corner of Katz and Nathan Street on the east side of South Vale. Look for the blue awning that says \u201cJEWELLERS.\u201d Break the left window to pick up the Blue Gem.\n\nNow, progress through the game as normal but make sure to stop at specific locations and then inspect the Blue Gem. The first location is on the roof of the Saul Street Apartments which you will go to when you are getting the Jukebox button. When you inspect the Gem in the right location, it will glow which means you have successfully checked off the location you are currently at.\n\nThe next place you need to use the Blue Gem is the pier of Rosewater Park.\n\nGet all the way to the start of the Lakeview Hotel section of the game. After getting off the boat used to get across Toluca Lake, use the Gem while on the dock to get it to glow.\n\nMake your way through all of the Lakeview Hotel until you complete the Lakeview Hotel Music Box Puzzle and can now go to Room 312. Instead of putting the Video Tape in the VCR, use the Blue Gem on the left window. This will immediately begin the UFO Ending.\n\nAliens will descend down but it won\u2019t just be them. It isn\u2019t Harry from Silent Hill 1 that gets off the fly saucer-like in the original game, but instead the PlayStation 2 version of James. he tells Remake James that he is nothing but a clone and it\u2019s time to take him home. An alien knocks Remake James out as the creature and PS2 James takes him aboard their spacecraft.\n\nYou can now get the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake. Stay tuned to Gameranx for more news, updates, and guides for Silent Hill 2 Remake as well as other great games in the future."

        "article_content": "Oct. 25\u2014When it comes to aliens, space exploration and the existential questions that arise around unearthly what-ifs, New Hampshire loves both the science and the fiction.\n\nJust don't tell anyone in Exeter the lore around the 1965 UFO sighting may be part of the fiction.\n\n\"The Incident at Exeter,\" which really took place in Kensington, birthed its own annual festival, which has been drawing up to 6,000 believers for more than a decade. But there's much more to it than that.\n\nThere's the should-be-obvious \u2014 the first American in space and fifth man to walk on the moon was Derry's Alan Shepard. And the not-so-obvious \u2014 a U.S. Space Force base is in rural New Boston and an 82-foot-wide dish in the middle of nowhere in Hancock is mapping the universe and tracking asteroids.\n\nAdd in Betty and Barney Hill's reported 1961 close encounter with aliens in the White Mountains, and Christa McAuliffe's star-crossed selection as America's first teacher in space, and it's clear New Hampshire has a deep connection with the cosmos.\n\nAs Exeter's Bob Cox likes to say, alien and space stories have captured the state's imagination because many residents were around for Shepard's flights, the 1965 sighting, and major advances in space exploration.\n\n\"I think it's unique because (the UFO sighting) happened here in 1965. It's not like it happened over a 100 or so years ago,\" said Cox, who is one of the organizers of the Exeter Area Kiwanis Club's UFO Festival, held every Labor Day weekend.\n\nThe incident\n\nSo what exactly happened in Exeter \u2014 er, Kensington?\n\nFirst off, the location has never been in dispute, but back then Exeter police were the first on the scene in Kensington because the tiny town didn't have its own department.\n\nAs Cox tells it, on Sept. 3, 1965, Norman Muscarello was hitchhiking home from seeing his girlfriend and \"got a ride into the Kensington area. When they approached Kensington, they saw a light in the field.\"\n\nThe 18-year-old Muscarello told the Exeter police he saw a flying object behind a barn. When police arrived, they saw an object hovering in the spot Muscarello had described.\n\n\"They took him in a squad car and drove back out there and they saw it too,\" Cox said.\n\nPolice and investigators from across the U.S. tried to figure out what happened.\n\nOfficials at nearby Pease Air Force Base told local law enforcement the UFO was related to a test they were running on aircraft, Cox said.\n\n\"One of the policemen who was on the police force at the time was honored at our last festival. There are people in town and in surrounding communities who actually lived through this,\" Cox said.\n\nCox, who moved to New Hampshire in 1978, said there have been UFO sightings all over the area.\n\n\"I've got to admit, I hadn't really thought about UFOs until I got involved with this,\" the 82-year-old said.\n\nThe dish\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation's National Radio Astronomy Observatory Very Long Baseline Array (a name almost as long as the program's reach) operates a huge antenna in the woods of Hancock.\n\nThe VLBA, for short, is a network of 10 radio telescopes from Hawaii to New Hampshire. The antennas work together as one enormous telescope through a process called interferometry.\n\nAstronomers can point all the telescopes at the same object in space to collect data for high-resolution images of things millions of light years away from Earth in \"unprecedented detail,\" said Jill Malusky, a spokesperson for the program.\n\n\"The VLBA is important because there is no other instrument of its kind in the U.S. \u2014 one that spans nearly 5,000 miles,\" Malusky said.\n\nRadio telescopes are different from optical telescopes because they collect signals humans cannot see. They can also be used during daylight hours and \"see\" through dust.\n\n\"Space is actually very dusty,\" Malusky said.\n\nThe VLBA has been around for 31 years and has collected all kinds of interesting data, she said.\n\nBut can the Hancock antenna find aliens?\n\n\"Everyone asks about aliens. I think it's fun,\" Malusky said. \"Yes, it can relate to finding life in the universe, but not in an action-movie type of way.\"\n\nRadio telescopes can find clues of extraterrestrial life by seeing the building blocks of life or by searching for non-organic signals created by intelligent life, she said.\n\nAlthough the telescope network has found organic molecules, it hasn't found any evidence of otherworldly beings yet.\n\nFor a practical application though, look no further than global positioning systems.\n\n\"Believe it or not, the VLBA helps make your GPS work. The VLBA was created in part by (and is often used by) the U.S. Naval Observatory for critical measurements of Earth's orientation, which is essential for the accurate functioning of GPS systems,\" she said.\n\nThe base\n\nThe New Boston Space Force Station (SFS) has been operational for more than 60 years in several different capacities\n\nPart of the five-year-old U.S. Space Force, which has its headquarters in Colorado, the base is part of a network of sites operating 24 hours a day. It provides satellite command and control capability to hundreds of military, government and civilian satellites performing intelligence, weather, navigation, early-warning and communications operations.\n\nThe base was \"originally established in 1942 as a practice area for bombers and fighter planes from nearby Grenier Army Air Field (which has since become Manchester \u2014 Boston Regional Airport). Starting in 1959, it was turned into a satellite-tracking station,\" according to the station's website. It was transferred from the Air Force to the new Space Force in 2020.\n\nThe Space Force now has dozens of bases in 11 time zones. New Hampshire's base comprises nearly 3,000 acres and is the largest outside of the Colorado hub.\n\nFolks in New Boston like to call their town the unofficial \"gravity center of the world.\" Residents revel in their fascination with aliens, decorating several floats during this year's Fourth of July parade with blow-up alien costume, stuffed cows caught in tractor beams, and references to the movie \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.\"\n\nThe man\n\nThere'd be no Pinkerton Academy Astros and Derry wouldn't be called \"Spacetown\" if not for Shepard, one of the Mercury Seven astronauts who made his landmark exit from Earth in 1961 aboard Freedom 7.\n\nHe was also the commander of Apollo 14 in 1971, the fourth of NASA's seven planned moon-landing missions.\n\nShepard also famously drove two golf balls from the lunar surface, but they didn't go quite as far as legend would have it.\n\nTo this day, though, the Derry police sport shoulder patches displaying a space capsule orbiting the moon and Pinkerton continues to name things after its most famous alum.\n\nShepard was also a central figure in the popular book \"The Right Stuff\" by Tom Wolfe, its movie adaptation (Shepard was played by Scott Glenn) and TV shows that followed about the American space program.\n\nFrom Earth to the moon, New Hampshire has played a strikingly significant role in space science, and for those whose mantra is \"I want to believe.\"\n\ndpierce@unionleader.com"

But they weren\u2019t in search of a drink \u2014 they were there to find a ghost.\n\nMichael Cardinuto, president of the group Long Island Paranormal Investigators, told guests to turn their phones off and recounted the tale of bartender Charlie Klein, who is said to haunts Katie\u2019s. There are stories of glasses flying off the bar and tables, and the sound of unexplained footsteps.\n\nFrom left, Tanya Leib at a weekly meeting of the Long Island Paranormal Investigators in Selden. Top right, Michael Cardinuto, seated at center, with members of the group. Bottom right, some of the equipment members use to conduct their investigations. Credit: Newsday/Elizabeth Sagarin\n\nCardinuto then led the group \u2014 a mix of guests and other paranormal investigators \u2014 past a poster for the A&E show \u201cParanormal,\u201d which filmed at Katie\u2019s in 2008, as he pointed a flashlight down a wide, green staircase to the basement.\n\nHe interrogated a possible ghost, asking questions of the air and hoping to capture on video, tape recorder or EchoVox app signs that something supernatural might be present.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty quiet,\u201d said Cardinuto, 44, of Selden. But he was undaunted: \u201cConsider it like fishing. You throw in your line and you hope you catch a fish. Every time I don\u2019t catch something, I still have fun doing it.\u201d\n\nSign up for the NewsdayTV newsletter From breaking news to special features and documentaries, the NewsdayTV team is covering the issues that matter to you. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\n\nInterest in ghosts has become more mainstream, with shows like the Travel Channel\u2019s \u201cGhost Hunters\u201d and \u201cParanormal Caught on Camera\u201d showcasing mysterious phenomena around the world. There\u2019s also the \u201cLong Island Medium,\u201d Theresa Caputo, who claims to communicate with spirits.\n\nBut while ghost hunting may be Halloween entertainment for some, for those who believe in the paranormal \u2014 essentially anything that doesn\u2019t have a scientific explanation \u2014 it\u2019s a constant search for validation that there is indeed a reality beyond ours.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do it for entertainment purposes. We\u2019re documenting everything that happens, whether we capture something or not,\u201d Cardinuto said. \u201cI never expect to find anything. When it does happen, it happens.\u201d\n\nTHE NEW PARANORMAL\n\nWhether or not ghosts exist, what is certain is the popularity of the paranormal. In addition to the many television shows on the subject, there are lectures, documentaries and conventions, including The Warren\u2019s Seekers of the Supernatural Paracon in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Long Island Paranormal Investigators has grown from 17 dues-paying members five years ago to 33 today, and Stony Brook University even has a paranormal club.\n\n\u201cBack 25 years ago if you were into this, you kept it hush hush,\u201d said Cardinuto, who attended the latest Gettysburg convention in September. \u201cNow you keep it very open.\u201d\n\nAuthor and historian Kerriann Flanagan Brosky, of Huntington, had already written two books about the town\u2019s history, both of which included ghost stories, when her father died in 2005.\n\nKerriann Flanagan Brosky and paranormal investigator Joe Giaquinto at the Hallockville Museum Farm in Riverhead. Credit: Elizabeth Sagarin\n\n\u201cI had always been interested in the paranormal, even as a child,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter my father died my husband suggested I get involved in another book project to help get me past the grief I was feeling.\u201d\n\nShe said people who attended her lectures had encouraged her to write a book combining local history and ghost stories. \u201cSo at that point I decided to do so.\u201d\n\nBrosky has since written several books about the paranormal, including \u201cThe Ghosts of Long Island,\u201d \u201cHistoric Haunts of Long Island,\u201d \u201cHaunted Long Island Mysteries\u201d and \u201cHistoric Crimes of Long Island.\u201d\n\n\u201cI interview people about their experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are legitimate people. The stories combine history.\u201d\n\nBrosky often teams with paranormal investigator Joe Giaquinto, of West Sayville, on lectures and investigations at libraries, historical societies and other locations.\n\n\u201cWhat better way to teach local history than through a ghost story?\u201d Brosky said. \u201cI\u2019m a historian first, a ghost investigator second.\u201d\n\nCardinuto sets up a sensor during the investigation at Katie's of Smithtown. Credit: Elizabeth Sagarin\n\nLOOKING FOR EVIDENCE\n\nCardinuto said religion started him on the road to the paranormal. \u201cI always questioned, \u2018Is there a God?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cDo you just die and that\u2019s it?\u201d\n\nWhen he was 23, he said he and a few friends took a video camera to the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, which operated from 1885 to 1996 and is said to be haunted. (State parks officials recently announced stepped-up patrols on the property starting Oct. 30 to discourage people from visiting the remaining buildings, which are not safe to enter.)\n\nDuring Cardinuto\u2019s visit two decades ago, he said his friends went in, heard a bang before the camera turned off on its own, and ran out. While many things could have caused both, Cardinuto said he began looking into the paranormal.\n\n\u201cWe bought some stuff (equipment used in paranormal investigations) and started looking up some locations on Long Island,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to see what people were experiencing at these locations. We started investigating.\u201d\n\nTwenty-one years and 850 investigations later, Cardinuto said he has visited many sites on Long Island that are believed by some to be haunted, including Lake Ronkonkoma, where an Indigenous princess\u2019 spirit is said to return each year to claim the life of a young man.\n\n\u201cThrough investigation and capturing evidence, a lot through audio, I feel there\u2019s something I can\u2019t explain,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we die, there is something.\u201d\n\nNIGHT HIKES\n\nParanormal investigator Daniel Hoffman, 40, of Floral Park, remembers waking one night, startled at the sight of a figure balanced on the edge of his bed that he said vanished as he woke.\n\n\u201cI jumped out of my bed and turned my light on,\u201d Hoffman, a Federal Express courier, said during a Long Island Paranormal Investigators meeting in the basement of Ciro\u2019s Nice Italian Barbershop in Selden.\n\nAfter that experience, he recalled, \u201cI was becoming curious about the paranormal. Then I saw \u2018Ghost Hunters.\u2019 \u201d He realized, he said, \u201cThere were teams that do this.\u201d\n\nHoffman and other investigators often go on night hikes and visit places believed to be haunted, searching for signs of something supernatural.\n\nThe members are serious about the work they do, but they also have a sense of humor \u2014 like the moment when an electronic scream filled the room during the meeting.\n\n\u201cThat was my notification,\u201d said Bianca Perricone, 34, of Shirley, who also goes by Medium Bianca Rose. \u201cMy phone screamed to notify me that I got a text message.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Long Island Paranormal Investigators at a weekly meeting.

They often use ultraviolet cameras, motion sensors, Geiger counters, barometers, thermometers and video and tape recorders in their work.\n\n\u201cThe theory behind it is when a ghost is manifested, it will give off some type of radiation,\u201d Cardinuto said. \u201cWe use Geiger counters to detect all sorts of radiation.\u201d\n\nAttuned to any anomaly, paranormal investigators capture flickering lights, footstep-like sounds, objects moving and appearances that they believe are evidence of apparitions.\n\n\u201cWe look for orbs, which are light anomalies that appear on images that are thought to be spirits,\u201d Brosky said. \u201cIt comes in and out of the frame, so it\u2019s not a dust particle.\u201d\n\nEquipment can capture electrical and other phenomena, which they take as reinforcing the possibility, if not necessarily proof, of things.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very big on trying to debunk things,\u201d said Cardinuto, who by day works with people with special needs. \u201cEven when somebody captures something in our group today, we play it and try to debunk.\u201d\n\nFear can fuel feelings and lead people to hear or imagine things that may not be there, the way someone who falls asleep watching a horror movie can have nightmares, Cardinuto said. Still, he talked about \u201cunexplained\u201d voices and images, including sounds he said his group picked up at the Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe in Shoreham, which was damaged in a fire last year. \u201cWe captured some audio evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cVoices captured on audio not there at the time of the investigation.\u201d\n\nMembers do free house investigations for people who say they heard or saw disturbing things, he said. He estimated they have conducted between 100 and 125 investigations. About 20% of the time, he said they detect signs of possible paranormal activity.\n\n\u201cYou look in someone\u2019s eyes and you see the fear,\u201d Cardinuto said. \u201cThey have no one else to turn to.\u201d\n\n\n\nHAUNTED BY HISTORY\n\nSarah Kautz, executive director of the Southampton History Museum, said the facility has hosted paranormal investigations and welcomes groups like Cardinuto\u2019s to help pique visitors\u2019 interest in history.\n\n\u201cWe get folks coming to the museum who wouldn\u2019t come to the museum for any other reason,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sort of tricks you into learning history.\u201d\n\nHalloween is, unsurprisingly, a popular time for such events. But Kautz said, \u201cIt\u2019s not just about ghost hunting. You learn about science. They use some really cool stuff. You learn about the history of the site.\u201d\n\nCardinuto\u2019s Gateway laptop has a Halloween-like ghost on it, but he, Brosky and others passionate about the paranormal are ambivalent about the Halloween rush. \u201cI love Halloween. It\u2019s skeletons and ghosts and witches,\u201d Cardinuto said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I do.\u201d\n\nBrosky said she believes there\u2019s a hunger for information about the supernatural. \u201cPeople love ghost stories,\u201d she said. \u201cI take the creepiness out of them. What we do is positive. It\u2019s not negative, not demonic. It\u2019s not Hollywood.\u201d\n\nShe understands the reaction some have to discussions of the paranormal: \u201cIf people want to be skeptics, they can be skeptics,\u201d she said. But, Brosky added, \u201cThere are things that can\u2019t be explained.\u201d\n\nShe talks about \u201cundoing perceptions of ghosts and spirits\u201d as demonic forces. \u201cThey\u2019re not out to kill or possess you,\u201d Brosky said. \u201cLong Island is more than the \u2018Amityville Horror.\u2019 We\u2019re rich in history.\u201d\n\nKautz said the world is full of enough that\u2019s difficult to explain to prompt curiosity. \u201cCan you hear something that sounds like a voice on a frequency we can\u2019t hear with our human ears?\u201d Kautz asked. \u201cUsually, you can find something weird. Explaining it isn\u2019t that easy.\u201d\n\nWhile Cardinuto said he\u2019s searching for possible evidence of the paranormal, members of Long Island Paranormal Investigators do come away with something definite: \u201cThere is an experience you have. It\u2019s an experience you share for a lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody else goes to the beach or the casino. Who else is doing what we do?\u201d\n\nSarah Hangley takes an energy reading at Katie's. Credit: Elizabeth Sagarin\n\nHoping to find their own Holy Grail \u2014 a sign that ghosts or spirits exist \u2014 some members said they enjoy the search itself. \u201cIt\u2019s an adventure \u2014 the investigation, the memories we make along the way,\u201d said Sarah Hangley, 37, of Westbury, a special education teacher who has been part of Cardinuto\u2019s group for two years. \u201cFear and the unknown make us a stronger group.\u201d\n\nCardinuto said members find camaraderie and a kind of peace in their work. \u201cThis is an outlet for most people,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a few hours during the week, we forget about everything going on in the world.\u201d"

Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nNew study redefines traditional views on black hole formation\n\nMIT scientists discover 1st-ever black hole triple system\n\nBy Akash Pandey 01:21 pm Oct 26, 202401:21 pm\n\nWhat's the story In a recent study, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have discovered a black hole triple system. This is the first time such a configuration has been observed. The unique system consists of a central black hole consuming a nearby star that orbits it every 6.5 days, and another distant star orbiting it every 70,000 years.\n\nTheory challenge\n\nBlack hole must have formed due to 'direct collapse'\n\nThe discovery of the black hole triple system is challenging existing theories about how black holes are formed. Traditionally, black holes are believed to form from the violent explosion of a dying star, a process known as a supernova. However, the newly discovered triple system suggests that this black hole may have formed through a gentler process called \"direct collapse\" rather than a violent supernova, due to the presence of a distant star orbiting the central black hole.\n\nAccidental find\n\nDiscovery of black hole triple system was unexpected\n\nThe discovery of the black hole triple system was somewhat fortuitous. The scientists stumbled upon it while examining Aladin Lite, a collection of astronomical observations from telescopes worldwide. They were initially searching for new black holes within our Milky Way galaxy when they made this unprecedented discovery.\n\nSystem focus\n\nTriple system centers on well-studied black hole\n\nThe triple system revolves around V404 Cygni, a black hole situated some 8,000 light-years away from Earth. Even though it is one of the most studied black holes (since 1992), none of the previous studies reported what study author Kevin Burdge and his colleagues observed. The team spotted two different sources of light near V404 Cygni, which led to the discovery of this unique triple system.\n\nMotion confirmation\n\nOuter star's motion confirms triple system\n\nTo confirm the link between the outer star and the black hole, scientists examined data from Gaia, a satellite that has been monitoring all stars in our galaxy since 2014. They observed that both the stars moved in perfect sync as opposed to other nearby stars. The odds of such synchronized movement are about one in 10 million, further solidifying their discovery of this unique triple system.\n\nSimulation support\n\nSimulations support theory of black hole's gentle formation\n\nTo understand how this triple system could have evolved and retained the outer star, Burdge and colleagues conducted simulations. The results overwhelmingly showed that the most plausible way for this triple system to exist is through direct collapse. This supports their theory that the black hole in question was formed gently, without a violent supernova explosion."

I'd like to try them but they had to stop me because they wanted to \u2013 for the character in the script \u2013 explore from scratch.

        "article_content": "Smartphones are constantly getting bigger, and the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL both stretch the boundaries of what\u2019s comfortable to use with one hand. Thankfully, Apple and Google also launched the iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro, which offer the same premium flagship experience in a smaller, more ergonomic form factor.\n\nEach phone boasts reasons to buy it over the other, and many of these have to do with AI. Both phones also cost $1,000, So, which one should you buy? Which phone has the best mix of hardware and software, and utilizes AI in ways that will improve your life? Let\u2019s dive into the details.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: specs\n\nSpecs iPhone 16 Pro Pixel 9 Pro Size 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm (5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches) 152.8 x 72 x 8.5mm (6.02 x 2.83 x 0.32 inches) Weight 199 grams (7.03 ounces) 199 grams (7.02 ounces) Screen 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR OLED 1206 x 2622 pixels ProMotion with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate Dolby Vision, 2,000 nits brightness 460 pixels per inch 6.3-inch OLED 1280 x 2856 pixels 120Hz dynamic refresh rate 3,000 nits peak brightness 495 pixels per inch Operating system iOS 18 Android 14, upgradable to Android 15 RAM and storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 8GB RAM 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 16GB RAM Processor Apple A18 Pro Six-core CPU Six-core GPU Google Tesnor G4 Octa-core CPU Mali-G715 GPU Camera Rear: 48-megapixels primary, f/1.8, 1/1.28\u2033, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 120\u00b0 FOV 12MP telephoto, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Front: 12MP, f/1.9, 1/3.6\u2033 Rear: 50MP primary, f/1.7, 1/1.31\u2033, PDAF, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/1.7, 123\u00b0 FOV 48MP telephoto, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Front: 42MP, f/2.2, PDAF Video Rear: 4K, up to 120 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Rear: 8K, up to 30fps\n\n4K, up to 60 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, tri-band Bluetooth 5.3 Wi-Fi 7, tri-band Bluetooth 5.3 Ports USB-C Gen 3.2 DisplayPort USB-C Gen 3.2 Water resistance IP68 (maximum depth of 6m up to 30 minutes) IP68 (maximum depth of 1.5m up to 30 minutes) Battery & charging 3,582 mAh 30W fast charging 25W wireless charging via MagSafe 15W Qi2 wireless charging 4,700 mAh 27W fast charging 21W wireless charging with Pixel Stand 12W Qi wireless charging Colors Black Titanium,\n\nWhite Titanium,\n\nNatural Titanium,\n\nDesert Titanium Porcelain,\n\nRose Quartz,\n\nHazel,\n\nObsidian Price Starts at $999 Starts at $999\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: design and display\n\nBoth phones have undergone subtle changes from their predecessors, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pixel 8 Pro. Unlike previous years, both now feature near-identical specs sheets to their bigger siblings, and they both offer the same flagship experience in a smaller, more ergonomic size.\n\nThe big difference is in style: Apple uses titanium in the build of the iPhone 16 Pro, which feels lighter and more premium than the Pixel 9 Pro, which uses aluminum, but comes in more vibrant colors. Even though they weigh the same 199 grams, the iPhone 16 Pro feels slightly lighter than the Pixel 9 Pro thanks to the titanium build.\n\nThe choice of titanium also means the iPhone 16 Pro features more muted colors than the Pixel 9 Pro. The four titanium color choices are beautiful, but none are quite as vibrant as the Rose Quartz Pixel 9 Pro. The pink color choice means your Pixel 9 Pro can stand out, although there are more traditional color choices available if Pink isn\u2019t your preference.\n\nMeasuring 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25mm, the iPhone 16 Pro is 3mm shorter, 0.5mm narrower, and 0.25mm thinner than the Pixel 9 Pro, but they feel virtually identical in the hand. The iPhone 16 Pro also has a Camera Control button on the right side,and the Action button on the left, while the Pixel 9 Pro has a mmWave antenna cutout on the top, even in countries where mmWave isn\u2019t available.\n\nBoth phones have a 6.3-inch OLED display, with a dynamic refresh rate of up to 120Hz. The Pixel 9 Pro display is slightly higher resolution, resulting in a higher pixel density (495 pixels per inch versus 460 ppi), but the difference is minimal. The Pixel 9 Pro has a peak brightness of 3,000 nits, while the iPhone 16 Pro doesn\u2019t get as dark at 2,000 nits. However, there\u2019s functionally little difference in the quality or brightness of the displays during day-to-day use.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro has a slightly better display, but there\u2019s no denying how good the titanium build on the iPhone 16 Pro feels in the hand. This one\u2019s a stalemate.\n\nWinner: Tie\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: performance and battery\n\nRecent Pixel devices have been plagued by problems with Google\u2019s Tensor GPU, and while Google has stuck with its chipset, the Tensor G4 chip in the Pixel 9 Pro is vastly improved. It\u2019s designed with performance and AI in mind and fixes many of the problems in the previous generation, including poor battery life and overheating. It\u2019s paired with a whopping 16GB of RAM inside the Pixel 9 Pro, which results in fast performance that left us impressed.\n\nIn comparison, the iPhone 16 Pro is powered by the new Apple A18 Pro chipset that\u2019s designed with performance, battery life, and yes, AI, in mind. Compared to the A17 Pro chipset, it offers up to 15% faster CPU performance, 20% faster graphics performance, and 2x faster ray tracing. The neural processing unit (NPU) performance is very similar, but the improved heat dissipation on the iPhone 16 Pro means it\u2019ll be harder to overheat your iPhone.\n\nThat\u2019s what all the numbers say, but as we discovered in our iPhone 16 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro reviews, both phones offer excellent performance in most conditions. The A18 Pro chipset inside the iPhone 16 Pro is faster than the Tensor G4 and more likely to handle future use cases, but neither phone disappoints in the experience offered today.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro features a battery capacity of around 3,582mAh while the Pixel 9 Pro has a much larger 4,700mAh capacity. However, the tight integration of hardware and software means the iPhone 16 Pro can have a smaller technical capacity and deliver slightly better battery life than the Pixel 9 Pro. In our testing, Apple\u2019s flagship lasts up to two hours longer, but both phones offer all-day battery life with some juice to spare.\n\nBoth phones offer \u201cfast\u201d charging that is among the slowest in the industry, and both phone makers have opted to use their own standard for faster wireless charging. The iPhone 16 Pro uses MagSafe for 25-watt wireless charging, while the Pixel 9 Pro requires the Pixel Stand to achieve 21W. However, both also support the Qi standard, with the iPhone 16 Pro offering up to 15W speeds when charging with Qi2 and the Pixel 9 Pro being capable of 12W charging when connected to a Qi charger.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is very similar to the Pixel 9 Pro, but offers slightly better battery life and overall performance. The Tensor G4 is no slouch \u2014 and vastly improved over previous years \u2014 but Apple still holds the lead.\n\nWinner: Apple iPhone 16 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: cameras\n\nBoth phones use a triple-camera setup and advanced algorithms to capture photos at a variety of focal lengths. The Pixel 9 Pro has better hardware on paper, but each phone has its pros and cons. Google has a slight advantage in still photography and software features, but the iPhone 16 Pro is better for creators and anyone focused on video.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro has a 50-megapixel main camera, a 48MP ultrawide camera, and a 48MP periscope telephoto camera that offers up to 5x zoom. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 Pro uses a 48MP main camera (with the Fusion branding) that captures high-resolution 24MP photos by default. There\u2019s also a 48MP ultrawide camera with a smaller f/2.2 aperture and a 12MP periscope telephoto camera that also offers up to 5x zoom.\n\nThere are many hardware similarities between these two cameras, but it\u2019s in the wider feature set where they diverge. The Pixel 9 Pro comes with features like Add Me \u2014 which makes it easy to include everyone in a group shot, even the photographer \u2014 Auto Frame in the Magic Editor, Zoom Enhance to capture more detail at higher zoom lengths, and Reimagine to help you reimagine photos using generative AI.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro also comes with a slate of camera features, although they\u2019re more geared toward creators. The Camera Control button makes it easy to launch the camera, swipe through different functions, and zoom in or out of a photo or video. The camera control button will also enable Vision Intelligence features later this year, offering a similar experience to Google Lens, where you can point the camera at something and learn more about it straightaway.\n\nThe upgrade of the ultrawide camera to 48MP offers far more detail and better color reproduction. The revamped Photography Styles allow you to tweak and refine your photos before you take them. There\u2019s also the ability to take 4K video portraits at 120 frames per second (fps), Dolby Vision recording, and improvements to audio recording. Audio Mix allows you to choose from four different styles and edit the audio in a video to match this professional style.\n\nBoth phones take fantastic photos, and personal preference will play into this. The iPhone 16 Pro ekes out a win, however, thanks to better photographic styles and video recording.\n\nWinner: Apple iPhone 16 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: software and updates\n\nBoth companies have made strong promises about software and updates, with Google promising seven years of security and software updates for the Pixel 9 Pro. At the same time, Apple makes no guarantees, but its phones have usually been supported for just as long, if not longer.\n\nThe Pixel 9 Pro launched on Android 14, but can be updated to Android 15 after the recent launch. The update for the Pixel 9 Pro brings a host of new features, including the ability to hide sensitive apps and improvements in theft protection, the ability to generate passkeys, and App Pairing. This last feature allows you to save combinations of two apps and launch them with a single tap.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro, meanwhile, ushers in iOS 18, which introduces one of the biggest overhauls to the iPhone experience. If you\u2019re an Android user, many of the new features in iOS 18 will feel familiar, because it\u2019s the closest that the iPhone has ever come to replicating the Android experience.\n\nSome of the biggest iOS 18 features include a customizable home screen \u2014 you can finally move apps wherever you want \u2014 a customizable control center, a new private folder for your apps, and the ability to lock apps behind a paywall. There are also huge overhauls of Apple Photos, new features in iMessage, support for the RCS standard for messaging, a new Passwords manager, and much more. It\u2019s a huge overhaul of the iPhone experience.\n\nBoth companies are also betting big on AI. Google dedicated much of its Pixel event to showcasing the power of Gemini as your voice assistant. There are new tools for creating and editing images, custom weather reports, a new screenshots app, and many more features that leverage Generative AI to usher in a host of new features.\n\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 16 Pro also bets big on AI, but takes a different approach. Apple Intelligence powers the revamped Siri, but it isn\u2019t launching until later this month. The full rollout of the new Apple Intelligence features won\u2019t be available until early next year, and while features like Apple Intelligence Summaries are some of the best use cases for AI, it\u2019ll take six months from launch for the iPhone 16 Pro to get the full suite of AI features.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel 9 Pro comes with one year of Gemini Advanced for free (after which, it\u2019s $20 per month), while the Apple Intelligence features on the iPhone 16 Pro are entirely free \u2014 except for the ChatGPT integration, which uses your existing subscription \u2014 although Apple may choose to charge for some features in the future.\n\nBoth phones focus on AI, and while Apple Intelligence has a lot of promise, the delay in launch means the Pixel 9 Pro offers better overall software and AI features right now.\n\nWinner: Pixel 9 Pro\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: price and availability\n\nBoth phones cost $999 for 128GB of storage, and each charges a $100 premium for the 256GB version. The Pixel 9 Pro costs $1,219 for the 512GB and $1,449 for the 1TB models, while the iPhone 16 Pro costs $1,299 and $1,499, respectively.\n\nThings get a little confusing when you consider the Pixel 9 Pro colors, however. The Porcelain and Hazel colors only come with up to 512GB of storage, while the Rose Quartz model is bizarrely only available with 256GB of storage. If you want the top storage, you have to go for the Obsidian (aka Black) color.\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro is far simpler. The four titanium color choices \u2014 Natural Titanium, White Titanium, Black Titanium, and the hero, Desert Titanium \u2014 are available in all storage options.\n\nApple iPhone 16 Pro vs Google Pixel 9 Pro: verdict\n\nTwo similar phones, from two companies that you\u2019ve heard of. This sums up this comparison, at least on paper. Once you dive in, you realize that the differences are subtle, but they do exist.\n\nBoth phones weigh the same, but the iPhone 16 Pro feels lighter. The cameras are very similar, and each camera excels in different ways. Even the software is fairly similar, with iOS 18 taking great strides to offer Android-esque levels of customization.\n\nWhich smartphone is best depends on which platform you prefer. If you prefer iOS, then buy the iPhone 16 Pro. For Android lovers, the Pixel 9 Pro is a fantastic smartphone. If you want to make the switch in either direction, there\u2019s no better time, but if you\u2019re thinking of switching to Android, it\u2019s worth noting that the Pixel 9 Pro is a great alternative, but the OnePlus 12 is the best Android alternative to the iPhone."

        "article_content": "HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 MSRP $1,400.00 Score Details \u201cThe HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 takes over the mantle as the best 2-in-1 convertible you can buy.\u201d Pros Solid build quality\n\nAttractive aesthetic\n\nVery good battery life\n\nGorgeous OLED display\n\nExcellent keyboard\n\nGreat haptic touchpad Cons Performance is just OK\n\nExpensive list prices\n\nI really liked HP\u2019s Spectre x360 14 2-in-1. It was incredibly well-built, drop-dead gorgeous, was built around a spectacular OLED display, and at the time, landed on our ranking of the best laptops you could buy. I was a little nervous when HP announced its rebranding, doing away with the Spectre line and introducing the OmniBook is its new brand for its entire consumer lineup.\n\nThe OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is the Spectre\u2019s true replacement, and when I pulled it out of the box, I was a little relieved. It\u2019s built around Intel\u2019s latest Lunar Lake chipset, and that needed testing, but the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 shares many of the same great characteristics as its predecessors. It\u2019s not as long-lasting as some other Lunar Lake laptops in terms of battery life, but it\u2019s still a great 2-in-1 option.\n\nSpecs and configuration\n\nHP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 Dimensions 12.35 x 8.51 x 0.59 inches Weight 2.97 pounds Display 14.0-inch 16:10 2.8K (2880 x 1800) OLED, 120Hz CPU Intel Core Ultra 5 226V\n\nIntel Core Ultra 7 256V\n\nIntel Core Ultra 7 258V\n\nIntel Core Ultra 9 288V GPU Intel Arc 130V\n\nIntel Arc 140V Memory 16GB LPDDR5X RAM\n\n32GB LPDDR5X RAM Storage 512TB M.2 NVMe SSD\n\n1TB M.2 NVMe SSD\n\n2TB M.2 NVMe SSD Ports 2 x USB-C with Thunderbolt 4\n\n1 x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2\n\n1 x 3.5mm headphone jack Camera 9MP with infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 7 Bluetooth Bluetooth 5.4 Battery 64 watt-hour Operating system Windows 11 Price $ 1,450+\n\nHP\u2019s prices vary from sale to sale, and so you have to check regularly to see what the actual price is when you\u2019re ready to make your purchase. The OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is no different. The base model with a Core Ultra 5 226V chipset, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and the standard 14-inch 2.8K OLED display has a list price $1,450 but is currently on sale for $1,100 at the time of writing. My review unit with a Core Ultra 7 258V, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD is on sale for $1,400, down from a list price of $1,750. And then the high-end configuration with a Core Ultra 9 288V and a 2TB SSD lists for $2,080 but is on sale right now at $1,730.\n\nIf you compare the list prices to a competitor like the Asus Zenbook S 14, another Lunar Lake laptop, the HP is more expensive. The Asus costs $1,399 for a Core Ultra 7 258V, 32GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 14-inch OLED display. The equivalent HP list price would be a more expensive $1,700, but the sale price is slightly less at $1,350. And then consider the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x, which is just $1,199 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chipset, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 14.5-inch OLED display. With 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, it\u2019s $1,313. That\u2019s less than the HP\u2019s sale prices.\n\nThe bottom line is that the OmniBook Ultra Flip tends to run on the more expensive side, though the sale prices make it more competitive.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Spectre x360 14 was an awesome 2-in-1. It had a gorgeous aesthetic, was solidly built, and featured some useful features like USB-C ports notch of the back corners that allowed plugging in and keep cables neatly out of the way. The OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 has a slightly less ostentatious design, but it maintains what was best about the Spectre. And it\u2019s a strong competitor against laptops like the Zenbook S14, the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x, and the Yoga Slim 7i that has a larger 15.3-inch display.\n\nTo begin with, the notches are still there and remain just as functional. The build quality is incredibly solid, with no bending, flexing, or twisting in the lid, keyboard deck, or chassis. The hinge is just slightly too firm to open the lid with one hand, but that\u2019s because it has to hold everything in place in clamshell, tent, media, and tablet modes. Simply put, the OmniBook exudes quality just like the best premium laptops.\n\nAnd while the OmniBook doesn\u2019t have the same colorful accents as the old Spectre, its all-black color way is just as attractive. The edges are more rounded, which is not only a good look but also helps the OmniBook being more comfortable to hold as a tablet. I\u2019ve mentioned a few other very nice laptops I\u2019ve reviewed lately, and the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is as nicely design as any of them.\n\nIt\u2019s also just as portable. It\u2019s thin at 0.59 inches and light at 2.97 pounds. Its display bezels are reasonably small, especially for a 360-degree convertible 2-in-1.\n\nKeyboard and touchpad\n\nI\u2019ve long been a fan of HP\u2019s keyboards, particularly those in the Specre lineup. The keycaps are large with highly legible lettering, and there\u2019s a ton of key spacing. The switches are light and snappy, giving a precise feel. I found the OmniBook\u2019s keyboard to be every bit as comfortable as Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard, my other favorite, for long-form writing \u2014 such as this review. HP gave the function keys a gray color and it helps them stand out, but that does detract a little from the otherwise cohesive aesthetic. The power button is a light-blue color with a bright LED, and it helps identify it but, again, it kind of stands out a little too much.\n\nEqually excellent is the large touchpad that takes up most of the available space on the palm rest. Not only is it large enough, it\u2019s also a haptic feedback touchpad that\u2019s responsive and supports clicking across the entire surface. It doesn\u2019t have the same kind of Force Click functionality of Apple\u2019s Force Touch haptic touchpad, but it\u2019s still very good and welcome here.\n\nThe display is pen- and touch-enabled, of course, and everything works as it should. If you want a laptop that can convert to a tablet for writing and drawing on the display, then the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is a great example of the form.\n\nConnectivity and webcam\n\nConnectivity is pretty light for a 14-inch laptop. There are just three USB-C ports \u2014 two of them with Thunderbolt 4, and one of them provides power. It\u2019s nice that two are tucked away in the notches, but I would have liked to see at least on legacy port and an SD card reader. At least there\u2019s a 3.5mm audio jack, which Dell dropped on the XPS 13. Wireless connectivity is up-to-date.\n\nThe webcam is a high-res 9MP model with an infrared camera for Windows 11 Hello facial recognition. There\u2019s also a fingerprint reader in the power button. This is as good a time as any to mention that the OmniBook has a fast enough neural processing unit (NPU) to power Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+ PC AI initiative. Today, it supports the enhanced Microsoft Studio Effects software, which includes AI-assisted background blur and replace, filters, and auto framing. HP\u2019s own AI Companion software is also on its way, which will support a variety of on-device features under the rubrics Discover, Analyze, and Perform that apply AI to getting intelligence assistance using the laptop, analyzing files, and optimizing performance.\n\nDisplay and audio\n\nThe OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 has one display option: a 2.8K (2880 x 1800) OLED panel running at up to 120Hz. Out of the box, it\u2019s awesome, with OLED\u2019s usual inky blacks and dynamic colors.\n\nMy colorimeter agreed. It\u2019s bright at 385 nits, although several OLED displays I\u2019ve reviewed recently are brighter. The Surface Pro 11\u2018s panel is an example at 533 nits. The OmniBook\u2019s colors are wide at 100% of sRGB, 95% of AdobeRGB, and 100% of DCI-P3, with a color accuracy of Delta-E 0.67, which is excellent. The Surface Pro 11\u2019s display is less colorful at 100%, 85%, and 97%, respectively, and its accuracy was around the same at 0.74.\n\nReally, there\u2019s nothing to complain about with this display. You\u2019ll love it. Dual downward-firing speakers pump out loud audio with some distortion at full volume, and with crisp mids and highs but little bass. It\u2019s pretty typical.\n\nPerformance\n\nThe OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is the latest laptop I\u2019ve reviewed running Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake chipset. Specifically, it\u2019s the Core Ultra 7 258V, a Series 2 chipset running at 17 watts. As such, it competes most directly against Intel\u2019s previous 15-watt Core Ultra U-series, but in practice it\u2019s the most immediate replacement for the 28-watt Core Ultra H-series processors.\n\nOverall, Lunar Lake has shown itself to be faster than the U-series, which was also aimed at efficiency, and in some cases to be faster in single-core tasks than the H-series while around the same speed in multi-core. We see that with the OmniBook compared to the Spectre x360 14 running that Core Ultra 7 155H. Notably, the OmniBook is slower than laptops running Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X chipsets, another efficiency-focused lineup. And then the Apple M3 has much faster single-core performance than all these laptops to go with very good multi-core performance.\n\nThe bottom line is that the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is plenty fast for demanding productivity users. Its Intel Arc 140V graphics are faster than its predecessor, but not as fast as entry-level discrete GPUs. So, that means it won\u2019t offer any advantages for creators or gamers.\n\nCinebench R24\n\n(single/multi) Geekbench 6\n\n(single/multi) Handbrake\n\n(seconds) HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V / Intel Arc 140V) 116 / 598 2483 / 10725 99 HP Spectre x360 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 155H / Intel Arc) 102 / 485 2176 / 11980 93 Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V / Intel Arc 140V) 109 / 630 2485 / 10569 88 Asus Zenbook S 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V / Intel Arc 140V) 112 / 452 2738 / 10734 113 HP OmniBook X\n\n(Snapdragon X Elite / Adreno) 101 / 749 2377 / 13490 N/A Asus ProArt PX13\n\n(Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / RTX 4050) 116 / 897 2710 / 14696 54 MacBook Air\n\n(M3) 141 / 601 3102 / 12078 109\n\nBattery life\n\nAs I\u2019ve stressed in each of my Lunar Lake laptop reviews, efficiency is the primary goal of this round of Intel\u2019s chipsets. As we see above, performance doesn\u2019t stand out, so battery life becomes more important. In part, that\u2019s because of the excellent efficiency of Apple Silicon, with the M3 chipset being both fast and efficient.\n\nHere, we see that the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14 is a lot more efficient than the Spectre x360 14, especially in web browsing. It\u2019s not quite as efficient as Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i and the Zenbook S 14, and the Qualcomm laptops are stronger as well.\n\nThe OmniBook is held back a bit by its 64-watt-hour battery, which isn\u2019t huge, and it also sports a high-res, 120Hz OLED display. That also doesn\u2019t help. And while it\u2019s not as good as some others, it\u2019s still a lot more efficient than most Intel Meteor Lake laptops. That means that while it can\u2019t keep up with Apple\u2019s M3, it will still likely get through a day\u2019s work with moderate productivity workflows.\n\nWeb browsing Video Cinebench R24 HP OmniBook Ultra Flip 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V) 11 hours, 5 minutes 15 hours, 46 minutes 2 hours, 14 minutes HP Spectre x360 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 155H) 7 hours, 9 minutes 14 hours, 22 minutes N/A Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V) 14 hours, 16 minutes 17 hours, 31 minutes 2 hours, 15 minutes Asus ExpertBook P5\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V) 8 hours, 54 minutes 16 hours, 29 minutes 2 hours, 15 minutes Asus Zenbook S 14\n\n(Core Ultra 7 258V) 16 hours, 47 minutes 18 hours, 35 minutes 3 hours, 33 minutes Microsoft Surface Laptop\n\n(Snapdragon X Elite X1E-80-100) 14 hours, 21 minutes 22 hours, 39 minutes N/A HP Omnibook X\n\n(Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100) 13 hours, 37 minutes 22 hours, 4 minutes 1 hour, 52 minutes Asus Vivobook S 15\n\n(Snapdragon X Plus) 13 hours, 10 minutes 16 hours, 19 minutes N/A Asus ProArt PX13\n\n(Ryzen AI 9 HX 370) 8 hours, 7 minutes 11 hours, 12 minutes 1 hour, 12 minutes Apple MacBook Air\n\n(Apple M3) 19 hours, 38 minutes 19 hours, 39 minutes 3 hours, 27 minutes\n\nA worthy successor to one of our favorite 2-in-1s\n\nThe Spectre x360 14 was a great laptop, maybe the best example of the 360-degree convertible 2-in-1. With HP\u2019s rebranding, I was wondering how much else would change with the OmniBook Ultra Flip 14. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t have to worry too much.\n\nThere\u2019s really not a lot to dislike about the OmniBook. It gets very good battery life, has a gorgeous OLED display, and it look and feels great. Its performance isn\u2019t the best, but it\u2019s fast enough, and its keyboard and touchpad are excellent. It\u2019s most attractive, though, at its sale prices."
