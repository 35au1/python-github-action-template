            "article_content": "NEW YORK, Dec. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumary, an innovator in smart lighting and smart home technology, will make its in-person debut at CES 2025, showcasing its creative products: the Permanent Outdoor Light Max, UFO High Bay Light, and the Next-Generation 4-Zone Solar Watering Timer. These industry-first products, developed based on market demand forecasts, mark Lumary's entry into various segments of the smart home industry. During the event, Lumary will exhibit at the Lumary CES Experience Center, located at Booth #40548 in the South Hall 3.\n\nLumary CES 2025\n\nThe Redesigned Permanent Outdoor Light Max Simplifies Installation and Enhances Nighttime Illumination.\n\nFollowing the success of Lumary's first-generation permanent outdoor light on Amazon in 2023, Lumary developed the new permanent outdoor light max based on user feedback. The latest model features a split design, innovatively separating the base from the light body. Installation is as simple as securing the base under the eaves and sliding the light body into place. Additionally, the LED beads have been upgraded, with reduced spacing between them, resulting in significantly increased brightness and a more vibrant decorative ambiance at night.\n\nIndustry-First Smart UFO High Bay Light: Simplifying Complex Wiring and Enabling Group Control for Workspaces\n\nLumary introduces the concept of smart lighting to traditional UFO high bay light, addressing the challenges of complex wiring and lack of centralized control in workspaces like garages, workshops, warehouses, and barns. With the Lumary App and remote control, users can easily configure and flexibly group lights, allowing groupings to be customized, split, or reorganized based on different task requirements.\n\nEquipped with a three-level motion sensor, the product enhances workspace safety while optimizing energy and time savings. The sensor detects motion up to 60 feet away, eliminating the need for manual switches, and offers adjustable illumination times ranging from 5 seconds to 60 minutes.\n\nIndustry-First Four-Zone Solar-Powered Smart Watering Timer: Revolutionizing Home Garden Watering\n\nFollowing the launch of its first battery-powered smart irrigation system in April 2024, Lumary has further enhanced the user experience with the introduction of a Wi-Fi direct connection version, eliminating the need for a Bluetooth gateway. The new Wi-Fi module features low-power design, with energy consumption as low as 400\u03bcA/h.\n\nThe system is equipped with an adjustable solar panel and two 4V 550F super capacitors, significantly extending its battery life (with a lifespan of up to 50,000 hours). Additionally, a highly requested water usage monitoring feature has been added, offering more intelligent management for home garden irrigation.\n\nStory Continues"

Donald Trump says. Shoot first and ask questions later. Speculation is for suckers.\n\n\u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country,\u201d the president-elect posted on Truth Social. \u201cCan this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThe government says not to worry. Which, of course, is what worries people the most.\n\nUntil most recently, the official response has been sketchy, sluggish and anything but helpful or reassuring.\n\nAs of last week, thankfully, the feds finally were providing a coherent reaction.\n\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, The Associated Press reports, the Federal Aviation Administration banned drone flights in 30 areas in New York and 22 in New Jersey, through mid-January. FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials say their agencies are looking into the sightings but have seen little evidence to suggest safety or security threats.\n\nWhat most people are seeing, officials say, are law-abiding, garden-variety drones. Or airplanes. Or helicopters. Or stars.\n\nThese are plausible answers. But many Americans remain unconvinced.\n\nThere are, of course, lots of precedents for our tin-hat predilections. \u201cYes, they can control the weather,\u201d a member of Congress posted on X only weeks ago, presumably about members of the other party. A vaccine denier may soon head the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Then there was a spate of clown sightings in 2016. (You can look it up.)\n\nBut the most famous was the \u201cWar of the Worlds,\u201d a 1938 radio drama about a Martian invasion based on H.G. Wells\u2019 science fiction novel that some Americans mistook as the real thing.\n\nIt all sounds like an episode of the \u201cX-Files,\u201d the popular old Fox series in which a pair of mismatched FBI agents delved weekly (9 Eastern, 8 Central Time) into monsters, aliens and labyrinthine conspiracies.\n\nSpecial agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder were an odd coupling of \u201cThey\u2019re out to get you\u201d-ism versus \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me-\u201d-ism. Mulder was the true believer, Scully the skeptic.\n\nI\u2019m more Scully than Mulder.\n\nI live in a neighborhood near enough to PTI Airport and far enough from city lights that the night sky is often vast and dark enough to reveal twinkling stars and a constant array of air traffic, some of it close and bright enough to resemble gliding Christmas trees.\n\nOccasionally, an aircraft headed for PTI will appear to be a UFO, sitting silent and still in the heavens. But it\u2019s always an illusion, a plane approaching head-on that only appears to be hovering until it turns toward the runway and you can hear the roar of its engines.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve hoped for a UFO sighting, just for the thrill of it. But I\u2019ve yet to see even one.\n\nAs for the mass hysteria over drones, it\u2019s another sign to me of the blessings of not living in a war-torn place like Gaza or Ukraine, where drones are ubiquitous and deadly, armed with missiles, bombs and bullets.\n\nSo, for now, at least, I\u2019m not buying the Drone Conspiracy.\n\nIn the end, maybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong. (Scully was in the \u201cX-Files.\u201d The aliens turned out to be real, as did many of the monsters of the week.)\n\nOn a more serious note, the ebbing faith in government and other institutions (insurance companies, media, big business, schools and universities) is for real and it is disturbing and unhealthy.\n\nWhen the center does not hold, things fall apart.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a lot scarier than blinking lights in the night."

Startups are building domain-specific solutions by customising LLMs with additional features.\n\nAI is also playing a growing role in critical areas like energy transition and healthcare. \u201cIn energy, applications optimise usage and extend battery life through software interventions. This has a cumulative impact, especially with the increasing adoption of electric vehicles,\u201d he said. Malhotra also highlighted its use in predictive maintenance for power plants and grid optimisation.\n\nHealthcare has seen similar progress, with chatbots providing initial diagnoses in multiple Indian languages. \u201cPatients can talk to machines regarding their problems and receive good guidance\u2026these chatbots now come in different languages, making them more open to adoption by the larger population,\u201d Malhotra said.\n\nTo support startups and enterprises, the Nasscom Centre of Excellence has launched initiatives to accelerate AI adoption. Malhotra said co-creation between them helps enterprises discover existing solutions rather than building new ones from scratch, making it a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation.\n\n\u201cThis programme connects startups with industries and funding organisations, making it easier for startups to access large enterprises,\u201d he said.\n\nNasscom\u2019s Future Skills platform is also addressing the skill gap in the AI sector. The programme, developed in partnership with the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), offers online learning resources to upskill professionals at nominal costs."

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nWhat's one way to charge more than $1,000 for a laptop in this day and age? Slap an \"AI\" sticker on it. Acer is not the only offender\u2014looking at you, Microsoft, forcing your Copilot key onto keyboards\u2014but the company has enthusiastically boarded the bandwagon with the Swift 14 AI AMD (starts at $1,199.99; $1,299.99 as tested), a notebook with a squiggly symbol on the touchpad that lights up when you use an AI app. Artificial hoopla aside, the Swift is a capable ultraportable laptop. However, it fails to unseat the Editors' Choice-award-winning Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch (UM3406), which isn't as fast but has a superior screen and costs hundreds less.\n\nConfigurations and Design: Covering All the CPU Bases\n\nThe Swift 14 AI AMD\u2014you'll find Intel and Arm versions, too\u2014starts at $1,199.99 with 16GB of RAM, which is on sale for $999 at the time of publishing. However, this test unit (model SF14-61T-R3U1) doubles the memory for an extra $100. It also carries a 10-core AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor with Radeon 880M integrated graphics, a 1TB NVMe solid-state drive, and a 14-inch, 1,920-by-1,200-pixel IPS touch screen.\n\nThe system's web page on Acer.com trumpets two non-touch display options with higher 3K resolution\u2014one IPS with a 120Hz refresh rate and one OLED with 90Hz\u2014but Acer disappointingly confirms they're not available in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the positive side, the Swift lands right on our ultraportable weight line at 3.0 pounds, compared with 3.47 pounds for the HP OmniBook Ultra 14. Measuring 0.74 by 12.3 by 8.8 inches, it's a fraction trimmer than that laptop as well. Its anodized aluminum chassis has passed MIL-STD 810H tests for sturdiness, but you'll still feel a bit of flex if you grasp the screen corners or press the keyboard deck.\n\nSlim bezels surround the screen, which opens 180 degrees and has a top lip to ease one-handed opening. The 1440p webcam centered above has a sliding privacy shutter and IR face recognition, joining a fingerprint reader embedded in the power button to give you two ways to skip passwords with Windows Hello.\n\nThe laptop's left side holds two USB4 Type-C ports, either suitable for the AC adapter, along with an always-on USB 3.2 Type-A port and an HDMI monitor port. Another USB-A port joins an audio jack at the right. Along with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth, this is a satisfactory array of connections. However, I would be happier with USB-C ports on both sides (so the AC adapter cord can't interfere with external mouse users) and an option for mobile broadband.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing the Acer Swift 14 AI AMD: Ai-Yi-Yi, It's AI\n\nAlong with the usual shortcuts for screen brightness, audio volume, and airplane mode, the top row has a key to launch AcerSense, a utility that combines system info and updates, diagnostics, power/cooling settings, and three Windows Store apps. These are LiveArt, which creates AI-filtered stickers from your photos; AlterView, which provides adjustable animated wallpapers; and GIMP, the robust but less consumer-friendly rival to Adobe Photoshop.\n\nA feature called Acer User Sensing taps the IR webcam to log you in when you approach and dim the screen or lock the system when you move away, as well as nagging you to take regular screen breaks and not get too close to the display. Acer QuickPanel pops up during video calls to provide AI-enhanced PurifiedView image and PurifiedVoice audio enhancements. And as always with Acer PCs, you'll see a few bloatware ads for things like the Forge of Empires game.\n\nPurifiedView mostly duplicates Windows Camera's recently added auto framing, background blur, and video fine-tuning for the webcam. The camera captures images that are brighter and sharper than average, with quadruple the resolution of cheapo 720p cams. Sound from the bottom-mounted speakers is moderately loud but somewhat scratchy and hollow; you'll hear little bass, but you can make out overlapping tracks. DTS:X Ultra software offers music, movie, gaming, and other audio presets (my ears couldn't detect much difference) plus an equalizer.\n\nThe keyboard commits two common laptop sins: teaming the cursor arrow and Fn keys instead of providing dedicated Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys and arranging those arrows in a clumsy row (with half-size up and down stacked between full-size left and right) instead of an inverted T. Its typing feel is decidedly shallow and flat, uncomfortable for long sessions. The sizable, buttonless touchpad glides and taps smoothly and takes medium pressure for a comfortable click.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could wish for higher resolution, but the 16:10-aspect-ratio touch screen is sufficiently bright, with clean instead of dingy white backgrounds and broad viewing angles. Its colors don't pop like poster paints but are rich and well-saturated, with decent contrast. The screen's finer details are crisp, and you'll see no pixelation around the edges of letters.\n\nTesting the Acer Swift 14 AI AMD: Near the Head of the Class\n\nYou'll find no shortage of other 14-inch ultraportables to compare the Swift AI 14 with\u2014or wanna-be ultraportables, I should say\u2014since several edge over our three-pound limit. The Dell XPS 14 and Asus Zenbook S 14 have Intel Core Ultra 7 power. So does our test unit's more costly cousin, the Acer Swift X 14, whose Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 instead of integrated graphics makes it the champion of our GPU benchmarks. The HP OmniBook Ultra 14 has an AMD Ryzen AI 9 processor like our Acer's.\n\nProductivity and Content Creation Tests\n\nOur primary overall benchmark, UL's PCMark 10, tests a system in productivity apps ranging from web browsing to word processing and spreadsheet work. Its Full System Drive subtest measures a PC's storage throughput.\n\nThree more tests are CPU-centric or processor-intensive. Maxon's Cinebench 2024 uses that company's Cinema 4D engine to render a complex scene; Primate Labs' Geekbench 6.3 Pro simulates popular apps ranging from PDF rendering and speech recognition to machine learning; and we see how long it takes the video editing tool HandBrake 1.8 to convert a 12-minute clip from 4K to 1080p resolution.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, workstation maker Puget Systems' PugetBench for Creators rates a PC's image editing prowess with a variety of automated operations in Adobe Photoshop 25.\n\nCompared with larger desktop replacement notebooks, the ultraportable performance baseline is usually decent workflow with everyday apps like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace\u2014say, 4,000 to 5,000 points in PCMark 10's main event. The Swift 14 AI AMD raises the bar, joining HP's OmniBook (which has a slightly higher-rated Ryzen AI chip) in crushing our processing tests. It's certainly suitable for content creation as well as routine productivity.\n\nGraphics Tests\n\nWe challenge laptops' graphics with a quartet of animations or gaming simulations from UL's 3DMark test suite. Wild Life (1440p) and Wild Life Extreme (4K) use the Vulkan graphics API to measure GPU speeds. Steel Nomad's regular and Light subtests focus on APIs more commonly used for game development, like Metal and DirectX 12, to assess gaming geometry and particle effects. A fifth test, Solar Bay, emphasizes ray-tracing performance.\n\nAMD's integrated graphics were not quite a match for Intel's, which in turn were no match for the Dell's entry-level discrete GPU, let alone the two-steps-higher RTX 4070 inside the Swift X. Most ultraportables are fine for solitaire games and video streaming, not playing the latest fast-twitch titles.\n\nBattery and Display Tests\n\nWe test each laptop's battery life by playing a locally stored 720p video file (the open-source Blender movie Tears of Steel) with display brightness at 50% and audio volume at 100%. We make sure the battery is fully charged before the test, with Wi-Fi and keyboard backlighting turned off.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTo gauge display performance, we also use a Datacolor SpyderX Elite monitor calibration sensor and Windows software to measure a laptop screen's color saturation\u2014what percentage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3 color gamuts or palettes the display can show\u2014and its 50% and peak brightness in nits (candelas per square meter).\n\nThe Acer AI AMD did about as well as an IPS- rather than OLED-screened slimline can in these tests, combining lengthy battery life and screen brightness with decent color reproduction. However, I still wish Acer would sell the 3K OLED display as an option here in the States.\n\nVerdict: Embrace the Hype?\n\nWe have a perhaps stereotypical view of most Acer customers as non-tech-expert consumers rather than power users, so we're not surprised the Swift 14 AI AMD does everything but put a cereal- or detergent-style \"Now with AI!\" decal on the box. Those looking inside the box, however, will find exceptional processing power and webcam quality. The stiff, flat keyboard dampens the experience, and other 14-inch ultraportables, like the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED Touch, include prettier OLED screens, but this Acer should satisfy many."

            "article_content": "In a recent chat with YouTube channel RichardMetalFan (posted on Dec. 13), Shadows Fall drummer Jason Bittner revealed why he \u201chated\u201d both Metallica and Slayer when he first heard them (and what led to him changing his mind).\n\nBittner\u2019s Discovery of Heavy Metal\n\nAt the start of their conversation, Bittner is asked, \u201cGrowing up, what were the first band that got you into metal and made you want to start playing drums?\u201d\n\nBittner responds:\n\nThe band that got me into \u201cheavy metal,\u201d technically, is Iron Maiden. Maiden\u2019s my favorite metal band of all time as well. That was the first band I saw of that genre in 1980, the day that MTV came on the air. I was 10 years old, and I was, like, \u201cWhat in God's name is this?\u201d And that just sent me on my trajectory [with] Maiden and Judas Priest.\n\nAside from Bittner\u2019s minor timeline mistake (MTV debuted in 1981), his love for Iron Maiden and Judas Priest isn\u2019t surprising. What is more shocking, however, is that he follows by confessing that he was far less impressed by Metallica and Slayer when he first heard them.\n\n\u201cI wanna say, I think [in] \u201984, a friend of mine let me borrow a record [Ride the Lightning],\u201d Bittner reflects. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you gotta check out this band.' And I'm, like, 'Who's Metal-licka?' And he goes, 'No, it's pronounced Metallica, man!' I'm, like, 'All right, cool. Metallica.\u2019 And I took it home and I hated it.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Shadows Fall Vs. Haunted Prison\n\nWhy Bittner Originally Didn\u2019t Like Metallica or Slayer\n\nInterestingly, it\u2019s related to his love for Bruce Dickinson and Rob Halford. Bittner explains:\n\nI was like, \u201cGod, what the hell is this?\u201d 'Cause I was used to Bruce Dickinson and Halford, and all of a sudden, you have James Hetfield, and I'm, like, \u201cWhat on earth is this?\u201d Maybe, like, a week later, I taped the album just in case I might like it one day, and I gave the record back to my friend. And, like, a week later, I'm doing my paper route and I was humming [a guitar riff]. And I'm, like, \u201cWhat is this that I'm singing to myself?\u201d And it was the riff from \u201cFight Fire With Fire.\u201d And I'm, like, \u201cOh, that's that Metallica band. I didn't think I liked that.\u201d\n\nHe continues:\n\nA lot of the heavier bands \u2013 even bands I've been in \u2013 when I've heard [them] the first time, I didn't care for [them]. Like Slayer. I hated Slayer at first. I'm, like, \u201cNo way I'm gonna like this.\u201d [Now] Slayer\u2019s my favorite thrash band of all time. Anthrax and Megadeth were the only two that, when I first listened, I wasn't, like, \u201cAargh!\u201d Like, with Anthrax, I was just, like, \u201cHoly shit!\u201d That was, like, the \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 the \u201cbe all, end all\u201d for me right there, because [drummer] Charlie [Benante] was . . . one step beyond [Slayer drummer Dave] Lombardo for me at that point, because, like, Lombardo was feet, but Charlie was the whole fucking package.\n\nWhat Made Him Change His Mind on Metallica and Slayer\n\nBittner add that he was introduced to Metallica first (followed by Megadeth) because a classmate mentioned that \u201cthere\u2019s this dude [Dave Mustaine] that was in Metallica before Kirk Hammett.\u201d\n\nHe explains:\n\nI didn't know about anything pre-'Kill \u2018Em All' . . . [and] he was, like, \u201cNah, this dude [Mustaine] was in the band before [Hammett], and he's got this other band and it's called Megadeth. . . And the first thing I heard was 'Killing Is My Business,' but that was so raw at the time. I was, like, \u201cAll right . . . it's kind of cool. It's fast and stuff.\u201d But, once 'Peace Sells' came out, I was, like, \u201cOh, all right. Now I get it.\u201d . . . Maybe a year after that or within that year, I got into Slayer. A friend of mine had Show No Mercy and he had let me hear that. And I wasn't really that impressed, but then Reign in Blood came out . . . and I bought that . . . went on a spring break vacation my sophomore year of high school to Florida with my mom, and all I did was just I had Reign In Blood . . . I listened to that record just incessantly for a week straight.\n\nFrom there, Bittner came to appreciate \u201chow hard thrash metal drumming was\u201d as he tried to play certain parts himself. \u201cSo, it was Slayer, then Anthrax, and it was basically through the \u201cBig 4\u201d and then everything else under the sun,\u201d he remarks.\n\nInterestingly, he admits that he\u2019s \u201calways been . . . a thrash metal drummer,\u201d adding:\n\nI\u2019m not an extreme metal drummer. I like that stuff, but . . . it's out of my wheelhouse. It's not what I do. But I like a lot of those drummers and went through that whole phase in the mid-'90s. [I was] immersed into Death and Morbid Angel and that stuff. Listening to Pete Sandoval and Sean Reinert and Gene Hoglan. So, my influences go across the board, really. And let's not forget Van Halen, either.\n\nThat\u2019s quite the musical journey, right?\n\nOf course, Shadows Fall recently released a new single and music video, \u201cIn the Grey,\u201d which marks their first piece of new music in over a decade. It also signifies their new partnership with MNRK Music Group.\n\nAs for Metallica, they were ranked no. 9 in Pollstar\u2019s recent tally of the Top 10 Worldwide Top Touring Artists of 2024. Likewise, they remain one of the top ten most popular choices for tattoos, and Kyuss\u2019 Brant Bjork acknowledged that he didn\u2019t like having the band labeled as \u201cthe next Metallica.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Slayer\u2019s Kerry King cited Sabotage as his favorite Black Sabbath LP.\n\nAlso, you can watch the full interview with Bittner below:\n\nShadows Fall\u2019s Jason Bittner Discusses His Musical History With RichardMetalFan"

            "article_content": "Terrifying night time phenomenon makes body freeze and 1 in 3 of us will experience it\n\nNight-time disturbances of the terrifying variety can make us believe in the paranormal.\n\nBut those of us unlucky enough to \"wake\" to the feeling we aren't alone or find our bodies suddenly at the mercy of mysterious forces will be relieved to hear that these phenomena have a scientific name and explanation.\n\nThe Sleep Foundation describes sleep paralysis as a \"temporary inability to move or speak that occurs directly after falling asleep or waking up\". During an episode, the boundaries of sleep and wakefulness \u2013 usually defined and distinct \u2013 are temporarily blurred, leading to a mixed state of consciousness wherein individuals maintain some degree of awareness, however distorted, of the world around them, while being unable to move.\n\nOrdinarily, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep combines vivid dreaming with atonia (the brief loss of muscle control), which works in our favour to prevent us acting out our dreams in real life. Sleep paralysis, on the other hand, seems to occur when the atonia and mental imagery of REM sleep persists even into a state of being aware and awake.\n\nMedical experts have grouped sleep paralysis into two categories. Isolated sleep paralysis, or one-off paralysis episodes that are not connected to an underlying diagnosis of narcolepsy (a neurological disorder that disrupts the ability of the brain to properly control wakefulness).\n\nRecurrent sleep paralysis, or multiple sleep paralysis episodes over time that are usually associated with narcolepsy.\n\nAround 75% of sleep paralysis episodes involve hallucinations. These can include intruder hallucinations, where the individual perceives a dangerous person or presence in the room; chest pressure hallucinations (also known as incubus hallucinations), which involve feelings of suffocation and often occur alongside intruder hallucinations; and vestibular-motor (V-M) hallucinations, which involve feelings of movement or out-of-body sensations.\n\nThe cause of sleep paralysis is not fully understood, but it has been associated with insomnia, disrupted sleep patterns, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and a family history of sleep paralysis. .\n\nTo prevent sleep paralysis, there are no quick-fixes or guaranteed cures, but some suggestions include: regularly getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep every day; maintaining a consistent bedtime and wake-up time; engaging in regular exercise, but avoiding it in the four hours leading up to bedtime; and sleeping on your front or side, as sleeping on your back can increase the likelihood of sleep paralysis episodes. .\n\nThose who are struggling with recurrent sleep paralysis may be referred to their GP, who could identify an underlying condition such as insomnia or PTSD. They may also be referred to a clinician who specialises in sleep disorders."

            "article_content": "In everyday life, when things turn out the opposite of what you expect, it's usually cause for frustration. In science, it's often the starting point for discovery.\n\nThat's what happened to a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and their collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Their unexpected findings in the lab point to an opportunity to improve therapies that use small RNAs to silence disease-causing genes, potentially including those involved in cancer.\n\nSometimes you do an experiment. You think you're testing one idea, but when it doesn't turn out the way you planned, it can lead you to find something else that's much more interesting.\" Eric Lai, PhD, developmental biologist\n\nIn this case, the researchers -; led by Seungjae Lee, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Lai Lab at MSK's Sloan Kettering Institute -; were testing how a protein called ALAS1 helps to make small regulatory RNAs called microRNAs. When they removed the protein from cells, they expected to see levels of microRNAs drop.\n\n\"But instead, we were surprised to see them increase,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nThat counterintuitive result led to the discovery of an unrecognized role for ALAS1 beyond its well-known role in the production of heme. (Heme is an important player in many biological processes, including in oxygen transport -; giving hemoglobin its name -; in energy production, and in making microRNAs.)\n\nThe team's findings were published in Science, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals.\n\nHow little RNA snippets silence genes\n\nBoth microRNAs and the related class of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small snippets of RNA -; just 21 or 22 nucleotides long -; that bind to specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and repress them.\n\nThere's a bucket brigade of players that together convert longer RNA molecules into the tiny active products, and a key takeaway is that scientists have harnessed this knowledge to turn small RNAs into drugs that can silence genes that cause specific diseases.\n\nThe first siRNA drug, patisiran, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 to treat a debilitating genetic disorder called hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. A handful of additional siRNA drugs have been approved since, with more moving their way through clinical trials. Doctors see great potential to develop siRNA medicines against both rare diseases and more common ones (siRNA drugs are sometimes called RNAi drugs, meaning they work by interfering with messenger RNA accumulation).\n\nA moonlighting enzyme\n\nBack in the Lai Lab, Dr. Lee had discovered that upon removing ALAS1 from cells, they made more microRNAs. And further experiments showed that removing any of the other enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway did not affect microRNA levels.\n\n\"This told us that ALAS1 has another job outside of helping to make heme, which no one had realized,\" Dr. Lee says.\n\n\"We can consider this a 'moonlighting' function,\" Dr. Lai adds. \"And here we discovered that ALAS1 has this secret role regulating microRNAs that's not connected to its normal role in heme synthesis.\"\n\nPotential to make siRNA drugs work better\n\nThe discovery led the MSK researchers to partner with colleagues from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who specialize in heme regulation and ALAS genes -; Makiko Yasuda, MD, PhD, Robert Desnick MD, PhD, and postdoctoral fellow Sangmi Lee, PhD. This allowed the MSK researchers to extend their findings from cell culture into custom animal models that the Mount Sinai group were developing.\n\nAnd in mice, again, removing ALAS (specifically in liver cells) led to a global increase in microRNAs.\n\n\"The emerging picture is that ALAS acts as a brake on the production of microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"So we thought, now that we know how to remove this brake, maybe we can use that to improve the efficacy of siRNA drugs and their ability to silence their target genes.\"\n\nIn theory, this knowledge might help boost the activity of siRNA drugs against any problematic gene that is overactive in disease, Dr. Lai explains. Potentially this could include oncogenes known to drive cancer.\n\n\"But we're not quite there yet,\" he says. \"Therapeutic siRNA drugs don't work well enough against all targets and are currently limited in where they can be used in the body.\" In fact, all six of the FDA-approved siRNA drugs target hepatocytes in the liver.\n\n\"It's straightforward to get drugs into the liver, which serves as a filter for the body,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nSo, as a proof-of-concept, the team showed that not only could they deplete mouse liver cells of ALAS, leading to an increase in microRNAs, but doing so also enhanced the silencing activity of another model siRNA compound delivered to the mice.\n\nCoincidentally, one of the six approved siRNA drugs turns off ALAS1 to treat acute hepatic porphyrias. Dr. Yasuda and Dr. Desnick worked on the preclinical and clinical trials for the drug, which is known as givosiran. Since an siRNA against ALAS1 works effectively and safely in humans, this raises the possibility of combining such an agent to enhance other siRNA drugs. Dr. Lai notes that this strategy could be generally applicable to any siRNA.\n\nAnd if siRNA drugs can be made to work better, this could improve their cost-effectiveness, reduce side effects by making them effective at lower doses, and perhaps help to target additional cell types beyond liver cells, he adds.\n\nWhy discovery science matters\n\nIn December 2024, Harvard geneticist Gary Ruvkun, PhD, was awarded the Nobel Prize with Victor Ambros, PhD, for their joint discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation in the early 1990s. Dr. Lai did his undergraduate thesis research in Dr. Ruvkun's lab at that time (on another class of gene regulator) and credits him for launching his own career.\n\n\"I got my first real exposure to how science was actually done and gained lifelong interests in developmental biology and small RNAs,\" Dr. Lai says, adding that his mentor's recent accolade underscores the importance of curiosity-driven research.\n\n\"Dr. Ruvkun didn't start out looking for microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"Like Dr. Ambros, he was investigating the development of nematodes, these tiny worms that live in the soil. And not only did this unveil an entirely new paradigm for how genes are controlled, the field they started eventually resulted in a novel class of human therapies.\n\n\"When people ask why we're not spending all of our research dollars directly studying diseases like cancer, why we're funding research into cells and processes in model organisms like fruit flies, yeast, and bacteria -; this is a great example of how discovery science fuels the biggest breakthroughs,\" he continues. \"And I think it is especially critical to keep this conversation active, given how much uncertainty and disagreement there is in society and government about how much to publicly fund scientific research and in what areas. Hopefully, there will be continued support to keep the engine of foundational research strong.\"\n\nFunding and disclosures\n\nFunding for the research includes grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01DK134783, R01-GM083300, P30-CA008748); a Cooperative Centers of Excellence in Hematology pilot grant (10040500-05S1); and a NYSTEM training award (C32559GG).\n\nThe researchers have filed a patent application on their methods for enhancing the efficacy of RNAi therapy by targeting ALAS1/ALAS2 (WO2024148236A1).\n\nDrs. Yasuda and Desnick are also co-inventors of a patent for RNAi therapy of acute hepatic porphyrias. They also report pharmaceutical consulting work. Please see the study for full details."

            "article_content": "The New York Times made headlines by suing OpenAI this year, but the case against AI isn't so black and white\n\nWhen you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Rael Hornby\n\nOn April 30, 2024, eight of the nation's largest daily newspapers, including the New York Times, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming both companies used news articles without permission to train their AI models.\n\nIt's among the most significant cases launched against AI developers to date and follows a separate, ongoing lawsuit filed on December 27, 2023, in which the New York Times claimed OpenAI committed copyright infringement through ChatGPT.\n\nWhen I asked ChatGPT about these cases, it dutifully gave me a summary of the 2023 case, including three main points: copyright infringement, a lack of compensation for using copyrighted content, and the ongoing nature of the case.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIronically, in explaining this case to me, ChatGPT may have pulled from New York Times articles, highlighting the exact issue at hand \u2014 or, at the very least, the issue that the newspaper has.\n\nBut is this case as black and white as The Times' own masthead? Given that its outcome could determine how companies handle the training of future models for potentially decades to come, it's worth taking a closer look.\n\n#9 in Laptop Mag's Biggest AI Moments of 2024\n\nThis article ranks at #9 in our round-up of the year's 24 most impactful moments in artificial intelligence. For the full rankings and more articles like this, check out the Biggest AI Moments of 2024 \u2014 a Laptop Mag Special Issue.\n\nA pressing matter: The case for The New York Times\n\nAt the time of writing, OpenAI is just one of several AI companies facing dozens of lawsuits. These cases often focus on some form of copyright infringement, with plaintiffs ranging from individual YouTube creators to media conglomerates and music studios.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen hearing about claims of copyright infringement by AI, musicians, actors, and writers may first come to mind. Hollywood has been at the center of tensions with the AI industry for years now, but the press and news outlets also play an important role in the battle against the misuse of AI.\n\nCases like the 2023 and 2024 New York Times lawsuits aren't just about protecting journalists from losing their jobs to AI. Unlike AI-related cases in Hollywood, these cases focus more on the exploitation of news articles by AI chatbots and the risks of those chatbots spreading misinformation under the guise of legitimate news sources.\n\nThe possibility of generative AI fabricating news isn't hypothetical, either. It's already happening. For example, in 2023, The Guardian blocked ChatGPT from scraping its website for training data after readers reported that the chatbot was generating news articles under Guardian reporters' bylines... that those reporters never actually wrote.\n\nSimilarly, the 2024 New York Times lawsuit against AI cited multiple examples of ChatGPT generating false product recommendations attributed to news outlets.\n\nThis completely fabricated information isn't just an inconvenient AI blunder. It may cause serious harm to readers who believe they're getting information from a trustworthy source. As the lawsuits claim, this can also damage newspapers' reputations if unsuspecting readers don't realize they're getting a recommendation or story that's completely made up.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, these lawsuits also raise the issue of lost revenue. It's no secret that newspapers rely on paid subscriptions to stay in business. AI models can give readers access to text from copyrighted news articles without paying for access to that content. So, the New York Times and the other news outlets joining it in the 2024 lawsuit claim they are owed compensation for OpenAI's use of their content.\n\nWhat all of this amounts to is a question of accountability. Can AI companies profit off of content they weren't authorized to use? Are they responsible for the damage done when their algorithms generate false or misleading content?\n\nGenerating headlines: The case for OpenAI\n\nThe Times' argument is sound enough, but as with any lawsuit, there are two sides to every story.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn response to the lawsuit filing, OpenAI would accuse The Times of incomplete reporting in a post titled OpenAI and Journalism published on their website in January 2024, stating \"We support journalism, partner with news organizations, and believe the New York Times lawsuit is without merit.\"\n\nOn the topic of copyrighted works appearing within ChatGPT, OpenAI offered insight claiming, \"[The New York Times] had mentioned seeing some regurgitation of their content but repeatedly refused to share any examples, despite our commitment to investigate and fix any issues.\"\n\nExploring these \"regurgitations,\" the name given to a bug encountered by OpenAI's models when it offers up training data as part of an answer, further, Open AI states \"Interestingly, the regurgitations The New York Times induced appear to be from years-old articles that have proliferated on multiple third-party websites.\n\n\"It seems they intentionally manipulated prompts, often including lengthy excerpts of articles, in order to get our model to regurgitate.\"\n\nFrom OpenAI's perspective, The Times' claims result from attempted \"jailbreaking\" efforts to force ChatGPT to reveal training data. As the company puts it, \"this misuse is not typical or allowed user activity ... we are continually making our systems more resistant to adversarial attacks to regurgitate training data, and have already made much progress in our recent models.\"\n\nReinforcing his company's stance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the lawsuit at the recent Dealbook Summit 2024 in December, stating \"I think the New York Times is on the wrong side of history in many ways.\"\n\nA case that's not so black and white\n\nIt's not just copyright infringement on the table in these landmark AI lawsuits \u2014 in cases of copyright infringement in particular, the outcomes could completely reshape the way AI models are trained in the future.\n\nTo some, LLMs like ChatGPT are simply spewing out pieces of pre-learned information to users, scraped from the training materials it was initially fed, raising alarm bells over how much of this \"new\" information contains another's work.\n\nHowever, AI developers claim that models such as ChatGPT don't work that way. To them, even if a model is trained on copyright-protected data, it's no different than somebody learning to play guitar by playing riffs from their favorite bands. If this person were to go on to create music of their own, they wouldn't be breaking copyright simply by having learned to do so by listening and learning to others who already could.\n\nThe jury is still out on which side of the argument will prevail in court, with both sides making strong cases.\n\nHowever, perhaps ChatGPT's excellence in delivering content that is so human-like will be its downfall, similar to the misunderstanding of the widely attributed Pablo Picasso quote (which, ironically, is also possibly misattributed): \"Good artists copy, great artists steal.\"\n\nIf you're anything from an AI enthusiast to the average AI tinkerer (or simply seeking out some of the additional features offered through Windows Copilot+ PCs or Apple Intelligence on Macs), then you'll need a powerful and performative laptop to keep up to speed with your needs.\n\nAt Laptop Mag, we review laptops year-round to ensure we're giving you expert-backed and up-to-date recommendations on which notebook is right for you.

            "article_content": "Trend: Sustainability\n\nThe South Korean government announced plans to mandate label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, replacing this with a digital QR code system over two years.\n\nSouth Korea has committed to a range of sustainability goals, including the slashing of plastic waste production by 50% and the doubling of recycling rates in the country from 34% to 70%, both by 2030.\n\nThe past few years have seen the Ministry of Environment (MoE) roll out a range of regulatory policies to this end, including the banning of hard-to-recycle plastics such as coloured PET from the recycling system as well as approving recycled PET plastic as material for new food packaging.\n\nThe ministry calling for public comment on another initiative earlier this year to mandate the use of label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, to be implemented after a two-year transition period.\n\n\u201cIn order to reduce the amount of label waste in the country from drinking water bottles and improve the efficiency of recycling systems locally, we will introduce a new label-free QR code system for all such bottles,\u201d MoE said via a formal statement.\n\nTrend: Sugar reduction\n\nThe Vietnamese government drafted regulations earlier this year proposing a phased increase on excise taxes for alcoholic beverages to 100% by 2030 as well as 10% for sugar-sweetened beverages, in attempts to curb overconsumption as well as boosting national income.\n\nVietnam is well-known for having very affordable alcoholic beverage prices, with beers in particular costing well below US$1 at most supermarkets and eateries.\n\nThe local government believes that such affordable prices have contributed to high consumption amongst consumers, and that it is now necessary to increase taxation on these drinks to ensure public health is not compromised.\n\n\u201cHigher taxation is necessary in order to reduce the consumption of alcohol in Vietnam,\u201d the local Ministry of Finance said via a formal statement outlining the draft regulations.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to gradually increase taxes to 100%, 70% and 100% eventually by 2030 \u2013 all of these are in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations to increase retail prices for alcohol by 10%.\u201d\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nThe general public and experts in Singapore raised several concerns over the consumption of cultivated meat, while also acknowledging it can play a crucial role in the City State\u2019s food security efforts.\n\nThese views were detailed in a study that aimed to investigate how both the public and experts perceive the risks and benefits of cultured meat on individual and societal levels.\n\nResearchers undertook four distinct online focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted between February and April 2022. Three FGDs involved participants from the general public, while the fourth included cultured meat experts. Each session, lasting approximately two hours, comprised nine to eleven participants.\n\nGiven Singapore\u2019s heavy reliance on imported food and its active promotion of novel food technology industries, including cultured meat, the market for such innovative foods is expanding, attracting more companies to the field.\n\nTrend: Viral trending product - Dubai Chocolate\n\nThe meteoric rise of FIX Dessert Chocolatier\u2019s chunky chocolate bars can be attributed to the growing influence of social media on purchasing decisions, exclusivity, and unique regional flavours, an analyst said earlier this year.\n\nFounded by Sarah Hamouda, the brand was launched in 2021 but only became viral this year \u2014 thanks to food influencer Maria Vehera, who filmed herself eating the chocolate bar and posted the video on TikTok, which garnered over 70 million views as of time of writing.\n\nSince then, people from all over the world shared their own reactions or tried to replicate the recipe at home, with the \u201cDubai chocolate fever\u201d spreading beyond the UAE to the US, Europe, and Asian countries like South Korea and Singapore.\n\nAccording to senior research analyst Monique Naval from Euromonitor International, this is the first time in recent years that a product from the Middle East has gained such global attention.\n\n\u201cWhile the Middle East has other unique chocolate offerings, such as chocolate-covered dates and camel chocolate, these have mostly been bought as souvenirs and their popularity have been rising organically over the years. In contrast, FIX\u2019s instant growth has been supported by social media and its limited production indicates exclusivity.\n\n\u201cThe increasing number of chocolatiers on social media has been driving consumer interest. With FIX\u2019s variety of filled chocolates going viral online, it showcases the growing influence of digital platforms in shaping modern confectionery trends,\u201d Naval told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nPlant-based dairy brands in India are continuing to steer away from using conventional dairy terms on their product labels until regulators issue greater clarity on what is permitted.\n\nBack in 2020 and 2021, the Food Safety and Standards Authority India (FSSAI) announced a ban on the use of conventional dairy terms such as \u2018milk\u2019 and \u2018cheese\u2019 for plant-based products. It also directed plant-based manufacturers to modify the product labels of all such products and e-commerce platforms to delist these as well.\n\nThis order was successfully stayed by the Delhi High Court later in 2021 after five companies took action. Despite this, industry uncertainty remains today.\n\n\u201cThe ban is essentially still a motion in hearing at the court level at this time,\u201d Rohit Jain, Co-Founder and CEO of Drums Food International which was one of the five companies that contributed to the initial ban being stayed, told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nTrend: Healthier innovations\n\nGlobal food and beverage giant Nestle had its eye on expanding its premium and healthy ageing product portfolios in search of a return to \u2018normalised\u2019 growth.\n\nNestle announced its FY2023 full year financial results, reporting a -1.5% year-on-year decrease in sales to CHF93bn (US$) but an increase of 17.3% in underlying trade operating profits to CHF16.1bn (US$).\n\nIn the firm\u2019s financial results press conference which FoodNavigator-Asia attended, Nestle CFO Francois-Xavier Roger highlighted that overall organic growth for the company has been estimated at a 7.2% growth year-on-year \u2013 but that this was made up of 7.5% pricing growth and -0.3% of what the company calls Real Internal Growth (RIG), which is a measurement of growth generated by volume and mix/innovation.\n\nAcknowledging this as an unsustainable means to long-term growth, Nestle CEO Mark Schneider told the floor that the firm was committed to move back to RIG-led growth in 2024, laying out several strategies towards this.\n\n\u201cThe food sector softness that has been seen over past two years globally has come from a food price increase spike that is the highest we have seen in some 50 years since 1973 to 1974, coming in at a 14.7% spike which is the highest since the 16.3% we saw back then,\u201d Schneider told us.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nPlant-based beverages may be considered suitable alternatives to their dairy counterparts but must overcome challenges related to flavour, consumer health, stability and nutrient dissolution, said researchers in Singapore, the UK and China.\n\nIn recent years, plant-based drinks have emerged as a diverse and popular choice, offering a range of nutritional benefits and catering to lactose-intolerant individuals, as well as vegans and vegetarians.\n\nNutrition-wise, plant-based drinks are said be a rich source of essential nutrients, including proteins, dietary fibre, fats, vitamins and minerals \u2014 beyond the calcium and protein associated with dairy milk.\n\nThese alternatives are typically derived from plant sources such as nuts, grains, legumes and seeds; examples include almond, soy, oat, rice and coconut drinks. Each variety usually has a unique flavour, texture, and nutritional composition, providing consumers with a broad array of choices to suit individual preferences and dietary needs.\n\nHowever, considerations such as amino acid profiles, digestibility and the presence of anti-nutritional factors should be taken into account.\n\nTrend: Sugar reduction\n\nMembers of the Philippines government called for regulations that would officially ban manufacturers from using added sugar as an ingredient in foods for young children aged three and below.\n\nSweetness and sugar features strongly in many Filipino foods and can be exemplified by one of the country\u2019s most popular desserts halo-halo, which is an amalgamation of various sweetened ingredients including pudding, ice cream, multiple sweetened beans and tubers, sweetened purple yam paste, jellies, cheese and more over crushed ice \u2013 and then commonly topped off with coconut milk, evaporated milk, syrups or sometimes even table sugar.\n\nThis culminated in the rapid rise of obesity and overweight individuals in the Philippines over the past two decades, according to the national science agency Department of Science and Technology (DOST)\n\nAs of 2022 some 27 million Filipinos were either overweight or obese, with the percentage of this having nearly doubled from 20.2% in 1998 to 36.6% in 2019. Even more alarmingly, similar findings were observed in the younger generation where adolescent obesity and overweight rates also nearly doubled from 4.9% in 2003 to 11.6% in 2018.\n\n\u201cRecent data has found that young Filipinos are at a greater risk of obesity, due to the consumption of food that is energy-dense and nutrient-poor, exacerbated by growing urbanisation and increased incomes,\u201d Senator Imee R. Marcos highlighted to the Senate earlier this year when tabling the bill calling for a ban on using added sugar in food products for young children.\n\n\u201cThe proposed bill seeks to ensure good nutrition, optimal child growth and development, and better health outcomes for children.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nSingapore cultivated seafood firm Umami Bioworks has highlighted its belief that strategic mergers are crucial to overcome doubts about the sector and achieve buy-in from major brands which can help the category scale-up.\n\nUmami Bioworks hit the news earlier this year for its merger with Shiok Meats, especially with both firms well-known for being cultivated seafood industry leaders and pioneers in their own right.\n\n\u201cThe M&A really came about when we saw that the market was unfortunately turning sour and sentiment was down during this trough of disillusionment period,\u201d Umami Bioworks CEO Mihir Pershad told FoodNavigator-Asia in an episode of our Food and Beverage Trailblazers podcast.\n\n\u201cWe know the market will come back once past this trough and that we will see recovery on the backside, but how good that recovery is and how long it will take is still to be seen so we needed to think about how to position the company to be in the best possible state to be the obvious choice for seafood industry incumbents to partner with both during this window and post-recovery.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nThe Thai government has published draft regulations on governance over the alternative proteins industry starting with the plant-based sector, and has suggested banning certain animal-related terms but allowing others.\n\nThis announcement was made by the Thailand Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Division earlier this year, which also established a special project research team to analyse types of standards and criteria that the regulations need to cover for the greatest efficiency.\n\n\u201cAt present, alternative protein products are seeing popularity amongst consumers and there are many such items on the market, but the control and supervision of the safety aspect of these in Thailand still has no clear direction,\u201d the Thai FDA stated via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cWe are embarking on a study of the current production and imports of alternative protein products in the country, and studying the related regulations [to apply this knowledge] in the development of regulations and standards in Thailand.\n\n\u201cThis will start with analysis of the plant-based protein sector in Thailand [before moving to] other alternative proteins such as insect-based, cultivated meat or fermentation.\u201d"

            "article_content": "For the 14th consecutive year, the Netherlands will experience a Christmas without snow, according to forecasts by Weeronline. Instead, the holiday is expected to be gray, mild, and mostly dry, a continuation of recent trends during the festive season.\n\nThe weather for Christmas week has been marked by unseasonable warmth. Daytime highs will range from 8 to 10 degrees on both Christmas Day and the day after, significantly above the seasonal average of 6 degrees. A brief cooler spell is expected later in the week as southeastern winds bring chillier air, with temperatures dropping to around 5 degrees by the weekend.\n\nWhile the holiday will remain dry, skies will be dominated by cloud cover. On the first day of Christmas, the nation is forecasted to see persistent gray skies, with limited sunshine. A slight improvement is anticipated for the second day of Christmas, with pockets of sunshine breaking through in some regions. From Friday onward, brighter conditions may emerge, although temperatures will dip slightly.\n\nThe week leading up to Christmas began with heavy winds and stormy conditions. Gusts in coastal areas reached speeds of 100 km/h, prompting Code Yellow weather warnings in the north of the country.\n\nWeeronline meteorologists attribute the lack of snow to a combination of mild temperatures and dominant weather systems over the Netherlands in recent Decembers. Snowfall during the holiday period is becoming increasingly rare.\n\nDespite the absence of snow, the mild and dry conditions will make travel easier for holidaymakers across the Netherlands. Shoppers, families, and travelers can expect minimal weather-related disruptions, a relief after the stormy start to the week."

            "article_content": "It may be an overused statistic, but it\u2019s true: We know less about what lives and lurks in our oceans than we do about outer space. This year proved no exception to the rule, either. In the last year, researchers discovered long-lost shipwrecks, odd animals, and even a phenomenon known as \u201cdark oxygen,\u201d among many other finds.\n\n\u2018Ghost Ship of the Pacific\u2019 found using underwater drones\n\nThe USS Stewart rests about 3,500 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Ocean Infinity\n\nIt only took a few hours for a team of 20-foot-long autonomous submersible drones to relocate the USS Stewart after 78 years spent at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The \u201cfour-piper\u201d destroyer ship was the only vessel captured by Japanese forces during World War II, and earned its \u201cGhost Ship\u201d moniker after numerous Allied troops sighted it deep behind enemy lines. Although eventually returned to the US Navy and scuttled, its exact location remained a mystery for years. Now, however, we know the extremely well-preserved remains lay off the California coast in the Cordell Bank national marine sanctuary.\n\nShipwreck hunters find WWII-era merchant ship that sunk in Lake Superior\n\nThe wheel of the Arlington, about 600 feet underwater. Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society\n\nAlthough also dating back to the WWII era, the Arlington wasn\u2019t involved in combat when it sank. The 244-foot bulk carrier was instead a merchant vessel sailing Lake Superior en route to Owen Sound, Ontario. Inclement weather, however, caused the ship to take on water in the early hours of May 1. While Captain Frederick \u201cTatey Bug\u201d Burke insisted his crew stay the course, the sailors had other plans, and soon abandoned Burke to his\u2014and his ship\u2019s\u2014ultimate fate. Like the USS Stewart, the Arlington was located using remote operating submersibles and sonar scans.\n\nNew, colorful starfish species found off the coast of Japan\n\nThe newly discovered Paragonaster hoeimaruae. There are many types of starfish and this one is particularly adapted to living in sandy, muddy waters, a feature the researchers want to learn more about. Credit: \u00a9 I. Kobayashi\n\nThere are around 2,000 cataloged starfish species in the world, but that list grew by at least one new variety in 2024. Discovered by researchers off the coast of Japan\u2019s Izu Peninsula, Paragonaster hoeimaruae, is only the second starfish known to belong to the Pseudarchasteridae family. The strikingly orange sea creatures are especially adapted to live in muddy, sandy waters\u2014an evolutionary trait researchers hope to learn more about in the coming years.\n\nGrumpy-faced fish species found in Red Sea\n\nThe grumpy dwarfgoby is endemic to the Red Sea and lives in small holes and crevices in coral reefs. Viktor Nunes Peinemann\n\nWhile similarly as orange as Paragonaster hoeimaruae, Sueviota aethon arguably features a much more noticeable physical trait: the diminutive fish possesses a downturned mouth that makes it look permanently displeased. Its face seems so irritated that it even earned it the common name of the grumpy dwarfgoby. The roughly one inch long fish live among the coral reefs of the Red Sea\u2019s Farasan Banks near Saudi Arabia. Even at that size, however, discoverers describe the grumpy dwarfgoby as a \u201cfearsome predator\u201d given its comparatively large canines used to capture and devour small invertebrates.\n\nWWII submarine discovered 81 years after disappearing during secret mission\n\nThe HMS Trooper disappeared in 1943 with all 64 of its crew. Credit: YouTube / Planet Blue\n\nIt took at least as many as 14 attempts over nearly 25 years, but researchers finally located the wreckage of the HMS Trooper in 2024. The WWII Allied submarine and its 64 crew members deployed on a secret mission near Greece in early October 1943, but never arrived in Beirut as originally scheduled. Researchers used both sonar and an ROV called \u201cSuper Achille\u201d to identify Trooper\u2019s whereabouts, as well as confirm its fatal run-in with a German mine. Trooper lays in three separate parts an estimated 830-feet-deep at the bottom of the Icarian Sea, near the Greek island of Donoussa.\n\nWorld\u2019s largest coral formation is longer than a blue whale\n\nA diver from National Geographic Pristine Seas measures the world\u2019s largest coral colony in the Solomon Islands. Photograph by Manu San F\u00e9lix, National Geographic Pristine Seas\n\nThe biggest animal in the world may be the blue whale, but researchers in 2024 determined that the biggest intertwined community of animals is undoubtedly the recently discovered Pavona clavus coral colony. Measuring in at 111 feet wide, 104 feet long, 18 feet high, and 600 feet around, the standalone coral system formed in the southwest Pacific Ocean over the last 300 years, and can even be seen from space.\n\nNew ghost shark species found in New Zealand\n\nThe newly described Australasian narrow-nosed spookfish, Harriotta avia. National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA)\n\nGhost sharks, also known as \u201cspookfish,\u201d technically aren\u2019t sharks, but instead are a group of fish that are closely related to the ocean predators. One of the newest additions to the family this year was Harriotta avia, described as having an \u201celongated, narrow and depressed snout; long, slender trunk; large eyes; and very long, broad pectoral fins\u201d as well as possessing \u201clovely chocolate brown color.\u201d But don\u2019t expect to encounter one in the open waters\u2014Harriotta avia lives near New Zealand at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, roughly 8,350 feet below surface waters.\n\n\u2018Dark oxygen\u2019 on ocean floor may rewrite the origins of life\n\nThe formations can be found as deep as 20,000 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Wikipedia Commons\n\nOne of the wildest underwater discoveries of 2024 wasn\u2019t a new species of life, but chemical processes that might rewrite our understanding of the origins of life itself. Earlier this year, researchers published findings related to polymetallic nodules\u2014natural mineral deposits located on the pitch-black ocean floor. Despite lacking sunlight, however, evidence suggests these formations appear to function as \u201cgeobatteries\u201d capable of generating trace amounts of oxygen that help sustain deep-sea life. If true, then the planet\u2019s very first living organisms may have gotten their start in a place no one once thought could support life at all.\n\nNew jellyfish discovered near Japan may contain multitudes of venom\n\nThe St. George\u2019s Cross medusa is about four inches wide, three inches long, and has about 240 tentacles. Dhugal John Lindsay/JAMSTEC\n\nLike many other similar species, the newly found St. George\u2019s cross medusa lives around 2,300 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean, and hunts bioluminescent prey with its many tentacles. Unlike its relatives, however, Santjordia pagesi packs an \u201carsenal of venoms\u201d that differs from other known jellyfish. Unfortunately, it might take a little while before researchers start gleaning more information on the creature\u2014it\u2019s difficult to gather more specimens given the jellyfish lives in a deep-sea volcanic caldera about 285 miles south of Tokyo.\n\nResearchers discover neurological mechanism controlling anglerfish lures\n\nFrogfish belong to the larger anglerfish family, and use their front fin as a lure. Credit: Deposit Photos\n\nAnglerfish aren\u2019t a new find for researchers, but biologists did confirm a surprising evolutionary feature in the odd-looking animals this year. Using tracer analysis, a team discovered the exact motor neurons that control one of the subspecies\u2019 front dorsal fin lure. It appears the location of these motoneurons shifted during their evolution compared to their relatives, pointing to evolutionary implications that reach all the way to landwalking vertebrates.\n\nOver 100 possible new ocean species found near Chile\n\nDuring an expedition off the coasts of Chile and Rapa Nui, scientists spotted a bony Chaunacops fish swimming in the waters of Chile\u2019s Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park. Schmidt Ocean Institute\n\nThe 1,800-mile-long Salas y G\u00f3mez Ridge near Chile is home to some wild creatures that look like they just arrived from an alien planet. Earlier this year, researchers used a remote operated submersible to survey the region and documented over 100 candidates for never-before-seen species. These included crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and even marine mammals. Biologists also glimpsed extremely rare animals, such as the whiplash squid."

            "article_content": "In everyday life, when things turn out the opposite of what you expect, it's usually cause for frustration. In science, it's often the starting point for discovery.\n\nThat's what happened to a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and their collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Their unexpected findings in the lab point to an opportunity to improve therapies that use small RNAs to silence disease-causing genes, potentially including those involved in cancer.\n\nSometimes you do an experiment. You think you're testing one idea, but when it doesn't turn out the way you planned, it can lead you to find something else that's much more interesting.\" Eric Lai, PhD, developmental biologist\n\nIn this case, the researchers -; led by Seungjae Lee, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Lai Lab at MSK's Sloan Kettering Institute -; were testing how a protein called ALAS1 helps to make small regulatory RNAs called microRNAs. When they removed the protein from cells, they expected to see levels of microRNAs drop.\n\n\"But instead, we were surprised to see them increase,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nThat counterintuitive result led to the discovery of an unrecognized role for ALAS1 beyond its well-known role in the production of heme. (Heme is an important player in many biological processes, including in oxygen transport -; giving hemoglobin its name -; in energy production, and in making microRNAs.)\n\nThe team's findings were published in Science, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals.\n\nHow little RNA snippets silence genes\n\nBoth microRNAs and the related class of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small snippets of RNA -; just 21 or 22 nucleotides long -; that bind to specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and repress them.\n\nThere's a bucket brigade of players that together convert longer RNA molecules into the tiny active products, and a key takeaway is that scientists have harnessed this knowledge to turn small RNAs into drugs that can silence genes that cause specific diseases.\n\nThe first siRNA drug, patisiran, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 to treat a debilitating genetic disorder called hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. A handful of additional siRNA drugs have been approved since, with more moving their way through clinical trials. Doctors see great potential to develop siRNA medicines against both rare diseases and more common ones (siRNA drugs are sometimes called RNAi drugs, meaning they work by interfering with messenger RNA accumulation).\n\nA moonlighting enzyme\n\nBack in the Lai Lab, Dr. Lee had discovered that upon removing ALAS1 from cells, they made more microRNAs. And further experiments showed that removing any of the other enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway did not affect microRNA levels.\n\n\"This told us that ALAS1 has another job outside of helping to make heme, which no one had realized,\" Dr. Lee says.\n\n\"We can consider this a 'moonlighting' function,\" Dr. Lai adds. \"And here we discovered that ALAS1 has this secret role regulating microRNAs that's not connected to its normal role in heme synthesis.\"\n\nPotential to make siRNA drugs work better\n\nThe discovery led the MSK researchers to partner with colleagues from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who specialize in heme regulation and ALAS genes -; Makiko Yasuda, MD, PhD, Robert Desnick MD, PhD, and postdoctoral fellow Sangmi Lee, PhD. This allowed the MSK researchers to extend their findings from cell culture into custom animal models that the Mount Sinai group were developing.\n\nAnd in mice, again, removing ALAS (specifically in liver cells) led to a global increase in microRNAs.\n\n\"The emerging picture is that ALAS acts as a brake on the production of microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"So we thought, now that we know how to remove this brake, maybe we can use that to improve the efficacy of siRNA drugs and their ability to silence their target genes.\"\n\nIn theory, this knowledge might help boost the activity of siRNA drugs against any problematic gene that is overactive in disease, Dr. Lai explains. Potentially this could include oncogenes known to drive cancer.\n\n\"But we're not quite there yet,\" he says. \"Therapeutic siRNA drugs don't work well enough against all targets and are currently limited in where they can be used in the body.\" In fact, all six of the FDA-approved siRNA drugs target hepatocytes in the liver.\n\n\"It's straightforward to get drugs into the liver, which serves as a filter for the body,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nSo, as a proof-of-concept, the team showed that not only could they deplete mouse liver cells of ALAS, leading to an increase in microRNAs, but doing so also enhanced the silencing activity of another model siRNA compound delivered to the mice.\n\nCoincidentally, one of the six approved siRNA drugs turns off ALAS1 to treat acute hepatic porphyrias. Dr. Yasuda and Dr. Desnick worked on the preclinical and clinical trials for the drug, which is known as givosiran. Since an siRNA against ALAS1 works effectively and safely in humans, this raises the possibility of combining such an agent to enhance other siRNA drugs. Dr. Lai notes that this strategy could be generally applicable to any siRNA.\n\nAnd if siRNA drugs can be made to work better, this could improve their cost-effectiveness, reduce side effects by making them effective at lower doses, and perhaps help to target additional cell types beyond liver cells, he adds.\n\nWhy discovery science matters\n\nIn December 2024, Harvard geneticist Gary Ruvkun, PhD, was awarded the Nobel Prize with Victor Ambros, PhD, for their joint discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation in the early 1990s. Dr. Lai did his undergraduate thesis research in Dr. Ruvkun's lab at that time (on another class of gene regulator) and credits him for launching his own career.\n\n\"I got my first real exposure to how science was actually done and gained lifelong interests in developmental biology and small RNAs,\" Dr. Lai says, adding that his mentor's recent accolade underscores the importance of curiosity-driven research.\n\n\"Dr. Ruvkun didn't start out looking for microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"Like Dr. Ambros, he was investigating the development of nematodes, these tiny worms that live in the soil. And not only did this unveil an entirely new paradigm for how genes are controlled, the field they started eventually resulted in a novel class of human therapies.\n\n\"When people ask why we're not spending all of our research dollars directly studying diseases like cancer, why we're funding research into cells and processes in model organisms like fruit flies, yeast, and bacteria -; this is a great example of how discovery science fuels the biggest breakthroughs,\" he continues. \"And I think it is especially critical to keep this conversation active, given how much uncertainty and disagreement there is in society and government about how much to publicly fund scientific research and in what areas. Hopefully, there will be continued support to keep the engine of foundational research strong.\"\n\nFunding and disclosures\n\nFunding for the research includes grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01DK134783, R01-GM083300, P30-CA008748); a Cooperative Centers of Excellence in Hematology pilot grant (10040500-05S1); and a NYSTEM training award (C32559GG).\n\nThe researchers have filed a patent application on their methods for enhancing the efficacy of RNAi therapy by targeting ALAS1/ALAS2 (WO2024148236A1).\n\nDrs. Yasuda and Desnick are also co-inventors of a patent for RNAi therapy of acute hepatic porphyrias. They also report pharmaceutical consulting work. Please see the study for full details."

            "article_content": "In the wake of canceling its hyped car project, a hard setback with an iPhone subscription service, and delays with AI feature rollout, it seems Apple has found a new sweet spot for product development in the smart home segment. According to Bloomberg, the company is working on a smart doorbell with Face ID authentication support.\n\nApple is already rumored to be working on an iPad-like smart home device that will serve as a home hub for other connected devices as well. Now, the folks over at Cupertino are eyeing a niche that will integrate well within the HomeKit portfolio.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nBloomberg\u2019s report describes it as a \u201csmart doorbell with advanced facial recognition that wirelessly connects to a deadbolt lock.\u201d The concept is pretty straightforward. Apple aims to bring its fast and reliable biometric authentication convenience to a doorbell.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nAt the moment, the segment is dominated by the likes of Amazon, Google, Eufy, and Logitech. The Nest Doorbell and Amazon Blink, in particular, often find their way to the top of the recommendation list for buyers. It\u2019s, therefore, no surprise why Apple would want to flex its way into the fray, especially when it has the tech stack, talent, and supply chain at its disposal.\n\nNow, the Face ID-ready doorbell project is in the early stages of development, which means its market arrival is neither close nor certain. According to a report that cites internal sources, enthusiasts should not expect to see anything on the market by the end of the year \u2014 at the earliest.\n\nThere is another probability. Instead of developing a hardware product of its own, Apple could very well outsource it to a third-party partner like Logitech or Belkin. That wouldn\u2019t be surprising. Take, for example, the Vision Pro, which sells a head strap for the headset straight from Apple\u2019s online store.\n\nThe upcoming device could be yet another host for the company\u2019s in-house combined chip for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which is reportedly making a debut in 2025 with the refreshed HomePod Mini and Apple TV models. The chip is apparently code-named Proxima and will reportedly be made by longtime partner TSMC.\n\nNow, a smart doorbell sounds like an obvious step in the right direction and could stand out with its facial recognition perk. Notably, the company already has the infrastructure ready (and is rapidly developing it with upcoming products) with a software stack in HomeKit that has already been embraced by various brands.\n\nIn addition, the upcoming home hub device that borrows from the iPad aesthetics will also run software that will connect with a whole bunch of other devices. It will also tap into the FaceTime system for videoconferencing. It won\u2019t be surprising to see it play nice with the upcoming smart doorbell camera via its video relay lane.\n\nThere are, however, a handful of concerns with the doorbell endeavor. Chief among them are chances of failure, especially when it comes to the possibility of an intruder somehow making it past the guardrails. The recent cases of abuse involving the AirTag tracker by bad actors is an example of one such scenario.\n\nApple has traditionally played it safe when it comes to user privacy and safety and has tried to skirt past such controversies to the best of its capabilities. So, there is a high chance that the company takes its own sweet time bringing the smart doorbell to the market or simply decides to offload the whole premise to other brands while milking royalty."

            "article_content": "(Each year, TIME recognizes 100 companies that are revolutionizing the world. Apply now to have your company reviewed by our editors.)\n\nAt the end of 2012, T-Mobile US was not in a good place. With a market cap of less than $6 billion, it was in distant fourth place relative to competitors like AT&T and Verizon. The company\u2019s trajectory changed in 2013, when it rebranded as the \u201cun-carrier,\u201d seeking to distinguish itself from competitors by offering simplified pricing structures, more flexible contracts, and a host of other customer perks. Thanks to these and other shrewd moves\u2014notably its 2020 merger with Sprint, which gave it access to mid-band spectrum, crucial for 5G networks\u2014today, T-Mobile has a market cap of over $200 billion and more than 100 million customers, making it one of the largest and most valuable mobile carriers in the world.\n\nDespite this success, the company strives to retain the hunger\u2014and the mindset of \u201cpunching up at giants\u201d\u2014that enabled its rapid growth in the first place, T-Mobile US CEO and president Mike Sievert tells TIME. Sievert took the helm in 2020, having previously served as COO since 2015. \u201cWe have a bigger opportunity in front of us than we\u2019ve ever had, because we are a technology leader who's transformed from a telecommunications company to a tech company, and that gives us a new canvas on which to serve customers,\u201d he says.\n\nThrough partnerships with leading AI companies like OpenAI and Nvidia, T-Mobile, which TIME listed as one of 2024\u2019s 100 Most Influential Companies, is looking to define the next decade of connectivity. TIME spoke with Sievert in November about his vision for the company.\n\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nWhen you interviewed Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang earlier this year, you spoke about inventing the future together. What kind of future are you trying to invent?\n\nGiven the level of influence that T-Mobile now has, we have a huge opportunity to craft the future of connectivity.\n\nIt's amazing to think about how important connectivity has become in our lives. Last week, we had a big storm here in Seattle, and we lost our power in our house, but we didn't lose our connectivity. The T-Mobile site nearest to us lost its power, but T-Mobile has this self-healing network, and it was able to reach us from a further away tower.\n\nI came to realize, if you made me choose between my power and heat or my connectivity, I\u2019d choose connectivity. I felt so good being able to make sure my kids were OK, my mom was OK, even though our lights were off. It underscores the essential nature of the service that we provide. That's why we're working with the world's best thinkers in the space to define what connectivity looks like a decade from now.\n\nNot surprisingly, it will be powered by AI technology: networks will optimize themselves in real-time to get you the very best possible signal, ensuring you're connected everywhere you go.\n\nWith Jensen, we\u2019re creating a future that we call AI-RAN [Radio Access Networks]. Right now, we have compute power at every one of our tens of thousands of network nodes all over the country, and we want to virtualize that into data centers\u201460 different data centers near the edge of our network\u2014so we get the efficiencies of being able to create a virtualized data center that puts all that compute power in one place.\n\nNetwork demands vary throughout the day. If we can use excess computing capacity to run AI workloads when network demands are lower, this opens up new potential for us to make the network better for users.\n\nWhat does it mean to virtualize the network into data centers? How does this make things better for users?\n\nIn our core business, AI-RAN has the potential to allow the network to self-correct in real time, which is going to be more important as payloads rise. AI will radically increase the demands on our network, so it's going to become increasingly important that we stay ahead of that rapidly rising demand.\n\nFor example, let's say, in the future, you're in a spot uploading high-def video to an AI cloud, to help you process the world around you, and a big truck moves between you and the tower you're communicating with. You're in motion, and the world's in motion. The network will reconfigure itself to keep that stream uploading.\n\nWe believe AI workloads will create an important role for edge clouds. Right now you have two kinds of workloads: you have the massive cloud workloads, which are very helpful where massive compute is needed. They're giving you textual responses, and sometimes photos and videos, but they\u2019re mostly taking in simple voice or text inputs. There's a lot of latency to that as it comes down from a central cloud. Secondly, there's AI that runs locally on your device. And these are both very different from each other.\n\nWe think there will be a \u201cGoldilocks demand\u201d as, for example, LLMs will emerge to be much more about video and photos and audio going in both directions. To process what it's seeing in real time, it needs to have the best of both worlds: a cloud-like compute capability, while remaining very close to the end user. So we think this will create an opportunity for edge clouds.\n\nNow, we don't have a business model around this yet. I rolled out a multi-year plan for the capital markets day that was financially exciting, and it includes zero for this. But we see it as a big opportunity, one of many now that T Mobile has a massive footprint and technology capabilities we didn't have just a few years ago.\n\nWe're making a bet that AI applications in general, as they become more immersive, will benefit from a Goldilocks architecture like I'm describing. That might be right, or it might be wrong. The great news for our financial picture is it doesn't matter\u2014we're going to build it anyway, because it makes our core business so much better.\n\nYou\u2019ve partnered with OpenAI to develop \u201cIntentCX\u201d, a platform that uses AI to figure out what customers need and act on it in real-time, which is set to launch in 2025. What do you think is the ideal customer experience?\n\nPart of it is, we want to remove pain points. Being a great provider of wireless service means you shouldn't have to interact with us much. We should prevent problems in the first place.\n\nIn 2023, we had the best year ever in terms of \u201cchurn\u201d: people leaving T-Mobile. But because we're so big, 8 million people left us. Think about that: 8 million people! I'm a pilot, so I\u2019ll use a pilot metaphor: every one of them fell down an \u201caccident chain\u201d. With every one of them, we did something wrong, which wasn't enough for them to quit, and then we did something else wrong, and then something else, until finally they threw up their hands and left. Every one of them left a breadcrumb trail of data behind on what exactly went wrong, and what we could have done to prevent it.\n\nIn the past, we\u2019ve done nothing with this data. We've never even looked at it. But we've spent a lot of the last two years reorienting our data estate so that for the first time, AI can be trained to look at all this\u2014network data, billing data, interaction and experience data, and other data about you\u2014at one time, so that we can see the breadcrumbs.\n\nWe will have advanced bots that blow your mind and do great things. But it's not about putting bots between us and our customers. We see this technology and ask ourselves: could we create an experience for our customers that's so great that they love us more?\n\nT-Mobile recently unveiled a plan to evolve from a \u201cchallenger\u201d to a \u201cchampion.\u201d What does that entail?\n\nManaging a team of people who have created so much success together over the last decade, one of my biggest leadership challenges is: how do you keep everybody hungry, humble, unsatisfied, and striving for the future? How we do that has changed.\n\nLittle old T-Mobile, when we were a fraction of the size of our principal competitors, created a culture of punching up at giants on behalf of customers, and created a turnaround that we called the \u201cun-carrier\u201d, because we're unlike those giant companies. And we always told ourselves, one day, we'll be as big or bigger than those other guys, but we must never become them: companies that basically hate customers, take them for granted, are motivated by old-school ideologies, and aren't risk taking or interesting. How do we keep all that in a time when we're successful?\n\nThat's what \u201cchallenger to champions\u201d is about. Instead of just trying to right wrongs created by other companies, can we create new norms that nobody ever thought of before? Things like: could we be the first to provide direct-to-cell service, working with SpaceX, so that we can have the end of dead zones and your mobile phone could be directly connected to a custom low Earth orbit satellite system? We announced that intention two years ago, and we're about to launch it. Another example is \u201cT-Priority\u201d: using advanced 5G technology to provide first responders across the nation with the world's only dedicated 5G slice for first responders. What's required of us in this challenger to champion era is to pioneer and innovate things that other companies couldn't do.\n\nIn a recent earnings call, you mentioned T-Mobile\u2019s \u201csecret sauce.\u201d How would you describe that?\n\nPart of what has defined us over the last decade is that we do what we say, and in our industry, we're the only ones. If you were to watch our Capital Markets Day in 2021, and then you watched everybody else's from around that time, we're the only company still working on the things we said. Investors and the public and customers love this about us. We're reliable, and that takes a company that can execute.\n\nYou also have to be able to look around corners. And maybe we were lucky, maybe we were good. But a lot of our success has been that we called the ball on 5G. The whole world, except us and Sprint, thought that 5G would be about new gadgets, not your smartphone, and that they would be connected by a technology based on millimeter wave spectrum. As recently as 2018, everybody was building assets for that future.\n\nAnd we looked at it, maybe because of our \u201clove our customers\u201d value, and said that's not what customers want. They want their smartphone to work everywhere they go, at least 10 times faster and better than it does today. And the technology to get us there is mid-band technology in a multi layer 5G network. So we went after Sprint, which had this treasure trove of mid-band spectrum, but a stressed-out business model that wasn't able to take advantage of it. Arguably, that's been the most successful merger in telecommunications history, because it created this company.\n\nWe were right about what 5G would be. Everybody else has seen that and is scrambling to catch up, but they're a few years behind. It's important to try to see around corners again\u2014we're determined to get the next era right as well.\n\nDoes anything about the future of AI make you apprehensive?\n\nI'm worried about not moving fast enough. These technologies are rapidly changing how we engage with the world of computing and with each other. Companies that are able to see that unfolding, make some bets, and intercept it, are going to be the winners. One question people have about AI right now, at least financially, is \u201cis it all a bubble? Will it turn out AI is better at poetry and humorous photos than creating value?\u201d My belief is that no, this is no AI bubble, but it'll be up to companies like T-Mobile to be customers of it, and to demonstrate at scale how it can transform our relationship with customers.\n\nIf the T-Mobiles of the world don't show giant breakthroughs from the technology, then the benefits will be delayed. So it's up to people like us. That's one of the reasons companies like OpenAI and Nvidia want to partner with us. They see that we're ahead, and they\u2019re as interested as we are in demonstrating real value for end users that improves their lives, and creates financial value for everybody involved.\n\nWe can already see the potential. After two years of working on it, one of the aspirations that I unveiled in September was to reduce person-to-person problem-solving and customer service interactions by 75% within a three-year period.\n\nAnd that's going to happen\u2014we're well on our way. We have a detailed quarter-by-quarter plan that is absolutely on track, and a lot of that value is already dropping in. That's one of many metrics that I unveiled. We're demonstrating to ourselves that this is real, partly because we've laid all the track. We've got the data estate in order. We have our T-Life app out the door. We're going to get the hardest part done in 2025. Once we've moved into big elements of delivery, I think we will have broken the back of this opportunity in the next 12 months, and we can taste that right now.\n\n(To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and decisionmakers, click here.)"

The new finale will be streaming exclusively with Hulu in the United States when it hits and on Disney+ in international territories. But as the special teaser shows, it\u2019s not just a look into Jugram\u2019s past either. Uryu Ishida\u2019s turning to the Quincies\u2019 side has been a major part of the titular \u201cconflict\u201d in this wave of episodes, and it seems like that\u2019s finally coming to a head with the finale.\n\nViz Media / Pierrot Films\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for Bleach: TYBW?\n\nBleach: Thousand-Year Blood War was originally announced to be a four cour long series with breaks in between, and with the end of the third wave of episodes, it means that there is really only one part left before it all comes to an end. This new anime has been the long in the works and highly requested adaptation from fans as it\u2019s been bringing the final arc from Tite Kubo\u2019s original Bleach manga to life at last. There are still some big moments that we\u2019ve been waiting to see, and they all hit in the last batch of episodes.\n\nBleach: Thousand-Year Blood War has yet to confirm a potential release window or date for Part 4 of the anime as of the time of this publication, but an announcement will likely come after the finale. It\u2019s been the case with the previous Part finales in the past, so a Part 4 confirmation is highly likely to follow in that pattern. Either way, we\u2019re one big step to bringing it all to an end decades after the original Bleach anime came to its truncated end."

Strategists polled by Bloomberg reckon not, forecasting Wall Street to triumph again in 2025.\n\nWhile some see President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies as a plus for the Magnificent Seven, their consistent profit growth is likely a bigger draw.\n\nEarnings are forecast to rise about 15.7% next year, versus the 9.9% expected for the Granalos, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIn a period of time when macroeconomic growth has been pretty unexciting and other sectors have had their challenges, that reliability of earnings delivery has given the market confidence in US tech,\u201d said Iain Barnes, chief investment officer at Netwealth Investments Ltd.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t see that from other markets,\u201d he added. \u2014 Bloomberg"

This is not smart economics. The FDIC - the Federal Deposit Insurance Company \u2013 was created in 1934 during the Great Depression after thousands of banks began to fail. Those who didn't lose their money right away, panicked and withdrew their deposits - causing what's known as a 'bank run' (famously depicted in Capra\u2019s \u2018It\u2019s A Wonderful Life\u2019), causing yet more banks to close. The agency was created to restore and maintain the public's confidence in the financial system...and it did. At the end of 1934, only 9 banks had failed compared to the more than 9,000 in the previous four years. Since its creation, no American banking consumer has lost money that was in an FDIC insured account, even when a bank fails. It also keeps an eye on financial institutions to make sure everything is operating soundly and consumers remain protected.Dec. 22, 2024"

The EU's apparel imports totalled USD 77.78 billion during this period, a slight increase year-on-year by 0.58 percent.\n\nThis brings EU's year-to-date clothing import to a positive side, from negative 2.02 percent growth in January-September 2024.\n\nWhile overall import value and quantity increased slightly, a closer look reveals a complex picture across different sourcing countries.\n\nChina, a major supplier, saw a slight increase in the value of apparel imports to the EU in the mentioned period, which is 1.14 percent suggesting a potential shift in the global apparel market.\n\nOther major suppliers like Vietnam and Cambodia experienced growth by 3.31 percent and 20.66 percent respectively."

            "article_content": "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a global leader in IT services, consulting, and business solutions, has announced its 2025 Cybersecurity Outlook, a list of technology trends and focus areas curated by TCS experts.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI), cloud security, and supply chain resilience will be key for organizations to effectively navigate the threat landscape in the coming year.\n\nAs next-gen technologies continue to gain momentum across industries, they give rise to new and complex threats. Experts and leaders at TCS have identified seven focus areas that will influence cybersecurity and help organizations prioritize their security investments to prepare for increasing cyberattacks.\n\nIn the face of emerging cyberthreats, enterprises are looking for ways to leverage GenAI to secure their businesses, according to TCS\u2019 2025 Cybersecurity Outlook. The cybersecurity trends to look out for in 2025 are:\n\nInfluence of GenAI in cybersecurity on the rise: GenAI is transforming organizational operations but is also being exploited by cybercriminals for advanced attacks like deepfakes, phishing, data manipulation, and new malware. In response, organizations must fight fire with fire by deploying GenAI-powered threat detection and response systems.\n\nCloud security remains crucial: As cloud computing adoption continues to accelerate, organizations need to implement strong security protocols like encryption, access controls, and continuous monitoring. Maintaining proper cloud configurations is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and breaches, and those moving to multi-cloud or hybrid environments will need to adapt their security measures accordingly.\n\nElastic supply chains will be relevant for operational integrity: In 2025, organizations will need flexible, resilient supply chains due to changing geopolitics and partner ecosystems. Leaders must develop proactive strategies to adjust their supply networks, while protecting sensitive data and maintaining regulatory compliance. Enhancing supply chain resilience will be increasingly vital for preserving operational integrity in the face of uncertainty.\n\nEmerging business models will underscore the need to be secure by design: At a time when digital technologies, IoT capabilities, and advanced connectivity are driving new business models in EV charging, DERMS, autonomous vehicles, and other connected factories, organizations must secure their value chains to ensure these businesses are safe by design. By 2025, the growth of IoT devices will require stronger device hardening, secure communication channels, and ongoing vulnerability assessments to maintain momentum in business growth.\n\nCybersecurity Mesh Architecture will pave the way for Zero Trust security: Organizations are moving from traditional security models to zero-trust architecture, which requires continuous authentication and limited access to minimize threats. By 2026, most large enterprises will adopt zero-trust methods, consolidating security tools to be more efficient. In order to adapt, organizations must use integrated platforms for orchestrating and automating cybersecurity while working towards Cybersecurity Mesh Architecture (CSMA) for dynamic, collaborative, and secure environments.\n\nCSOs will adopt an \u2018automation-first\u2019 approach to Managed Detection and Response: Modern Managed Detection and Response (MDR) combines Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Security Operation Centers (SOCs), Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR), Extended Detection and Response (XDR), threat hunting, threat intelligence, and various attack simulations. These components must integrate seamlessly under an \u201cautomation-first\u201d approach for strong cyber defense against new technologies like Gen AI, quantum computing, and 5G expansion. By 2025, organizations are likely to seek more industry-specific and integrated cyber-physical security solutions.\n\nBack to basics: Cyber resilience will be essential for business security: Now more than ever, a robust cyber resilience strategy is crucial for organizations to handle unexpected cyber incidents and will require taking a fresh look at the basics: regular backups, detailed incident response plans, and business continuity measures. Something as simple as regular drills can enhance organizational preparedness and response capabilities. Promoting a culture of resilience will help minimize downtime and disruptions from cyberattacks.\n\nA leader in cybersecurity globally, TCS\u2019 offerings range from consulting, implementation, to managed security services across \u2013 detection and response, identity and access management, attack surface management, governance, risk and compliance, data privacy and protection, digital forensics and incident response, cloud security, and cyber physical security. These offerings are tailored to address industry-specific challenges. With over 16,000 cybersecurity professionals on its roster, TCS helps over 600 enterprises across the globe protect their entire digital estate and improve their security posture. TCS's network of 15+ cybersecurity delivery centres worldwide enable secure businesses across geographies."

While there's no direct connection to Jesus, it represents the type of vessel he and his disciples, some of whom were fishermen, would have used. This provides valuable insight into the fishing industry and maritime life in Galilee during that period.\n\nDiscovered in 1986 on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, this fishing boat dates back to roughly the time of Jesus.

The Madaba Map: While dating to several centuries after Jesus's life (6th century AD), the Madaba Map, a mosaic discovered in Jordan, provides the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. It offers a valuable visual representation of the region's geography during the Byzantine period and helps us understand the landscape and urban layout of cities like Jerusalem during the Roman and Byzantine eras."

            "article_content": "The truth is out there, whirring in the night sky, taunting us with winking lights and erratic zigs and zags.\n\nLike a plague of locusts, they keep coming, torturing us with their mystery.\n\nWhat are they, where are they from, what do they want and why won\u2019t the government give us a straight answer?\n\nAre they chariots of the gods from a strange new world in a galaxy far, far away?\n\nOr the villainous handiwork of China or Putin or Little Rocket Man?\n\nOr even an inside job \u2026 deep state spies, dispatched from a secret drone hangar in the basement of a D.C. pizza parlor?\n\nWho cares? Donald Trump says. Shoot first and ask questions later. Speculation is for suckers.\n\n\u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country,\u201d the president-elect posted on Truth Social. \u201cCan this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThe government says not to worry. Which, of course, is what worries people the most.\n\nUntil most recently, the official response has been sketchy, sluggish and anything but helpful or reassuring.\n\nAs of last week, thankfully, the feds finally were providing a coherent reaction.\n\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, The Associated Press reports, the Federal Aviation Administration banned drone flights in 30 areas in New York and 22 in New Jersey, through mid-January. FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials say their agencies are looking into the sightings but have seen little evidence to suggest safety or security threats.\n\nWhat most people are seeing, officials say, are law-abiding, garden-variety drones. Or airplanes. Or helicopters. Or stars.\n\nThese are plausible answers. But many Americans remain unconvinced.\n\nThere are, of course, lots of precedents for our tin-hat predilections. \u201cYes, they can control the weather,\u201d a member of Congress posted on X only weeks ago, presumably about members of the other party. A vaccine denier may soon head the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Then there was a spate of clown sightings in 2016. (You can look it up.)\n\nBut the most famous was the \u201cWar of the Worlds,\u201d a 1938 radio drama about a Martian invasion based on H.G. Wells\u2019 science fiction novel that some Americans mistook as the real thing.\n\nIt all sounds like an episode of the \u201cX-Files,\u201d the popular old Fox series in which a pair of mismatched FBI agents delved weekly (9 Eastern, 8 Central Time) into monsters, aliens and labyrinthine conspiracies.\n\nSpecial agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder were an odd coupling of \u201cThey\u2019re out to get you\u201d-ism versus \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me-\u201d-ism. Mulder was the true believer, Scully the skeptic.\n\nI\u2019m more Scully than Mulder.\n\nI live in a neighborhood near enough to PTI Airport and far enough from city lights that the night sky is often vast and dark enough to reveal twinkling stars and a constant array of air traffic, some of it close and bright enough to resemble gliding Christmas trees.\n\nOccasionally, an aircraft headed for PTI will appear to be a UFO, sitting silent and still in the heavens. But it\u2019s always an illusion, a plane approaching head-on that only appears to be hovering until it turns toward the runway and you can hear the roar of its engines.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019ve hoped for a UFO sighting, just for the thrill of it. But I\u2019ve yet to see even one.\n\nAs for the mass hysteria over drones, it\u2019s another sign to me of the blessings of not living in a war-torn place like Gaza or Ukraine, where drones are ubiquitous and deadly, armed with missiles, bombs and bullets.\n\nSo, for now, at least, I\u2019m not buying the Drone Conspiracy.\n\nIn the end, maybe I\u2019ll be proven wrong. (Scully was in the \u201cX-Files.\u201d The aliens turned out to be real, as did many of the monsters of the week.)\n\nOn a more serious note, the ebbing faith in government and other institutions (insurance companies, media, big business, schools and universities) is for real and it is disturbing and unhealthy.\n\nWhen the center does not hold, things fall apart.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a lot scarier than blinking lights in the night."

            "article_content": "Scientists have long known that light can sometimes appear to exit a material before entering it \u2013 an effect dismissed as an illusion caused by how waves are distorted by matter.\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Toronto, through innovative quantum experiments, say they have demonstrated that \"negative time\" isn't just a theoretical idea \u2013 it exists in a tangible, physical sense, deserving closer scrutiny.\n\nThe findings, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, have attracted both global attention and skepticism.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that these perplexing results highlight a peculiar quirk of quantum mechanics rather than a radical shift in our understanding of time.\n\n\"This is tough stuff, even for us to talk about with other physicists. We get misunderstood all the time,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a University of Toronto professor specializing in experimental quantum physics.\n\nWhile the term \"negative time\" might sound like a concept lifted from science fiction, Steinberg defends its use, hoping it will spark deeper discussions about the mysteries of quantum physics.\n\nLaser experiments\n\nYears ago, the team began exploring interactions between light and matter.\n\nWhen light particles, or photons, pass through atoms, some are absorbed by the atoms and later re-emitted. This interaction changes the atoms, temporarily putting them in a higher-energy or \"excited\" state before they return to normal.\n\nIn research led by Daniela Angulo, the team set out to measure how long these atoms stayed in their excited state. \"That time turned out to be negative,\" Steinberg explained \u2013 meaning a duration less than zero.\n\nTo visualize this concept, imagine cars entering a tunnel: before the experiment, physicists recognized that while the average entry time for a thousand cars might be, for example, noon, the first cars could exit a little sooner, say 11:59 am. This result was previously dismissed as meaningless.\n\nWhat Angulo and colleagues demonstrated was akin to measuring carbon monoxide levels in the tunnel after the first few cars emerged and finding that the readings had a minus sign in front of them.\n\nRelativity intact\n\nThe experiments, conducted in a cluttered basement laboratory bristling with wires and aluminum-wrapped devices, took over two years to optimize. The lasers used had to be carefully calibrated to avoid distorting the results.\n\nStill, Steinberg and Angulo are quick to clarify: no one is claiming time travel is a possibility. \"We don't want to say anything traveled backward in time,\" Steinberg said. \"That's a misinterpretation.\"\n\nThe explanation lies in quantum mechanics, where particles like photons behave in fuzzy, probabilistic ways rather than following strict rules.\n\nInstead of adhering to a fixed timeline for absorption and re-emission, these interactions occur across a spectrum of possible durations \u2013 some of which defy everyday intuition.\n\nCritically, the researchers say, this doesn't violate Einstein's theory of special relativity, which dictates that nothing can travel faster than light. These photons carried no information, sidestepping any cosmic speed limits.\n\nA divisive discovery\n\nThe concept of \"negative time\" has drawn both fascination and skepticism, particularly from prominent voices in the scientific community.\n\nGerman theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, for one, criticized the work in a YouTube video viewed by over 250,000 people, noting, \"The negative time in this experiment has nothing to do with the passage of time \u2013 it's just a way to describe how photons travel through a medium and how their phases shift.\"\n\nAngulo and Steinberg pushed back, arguing that their research addresses crucial gaps in understanding why light doesn't always travel at a constant speed.\n\nSteinberg acknowledged the controversy surrounding their paper's provocative headline but pointed out that no serious scientist has challenged the experimental results.\n\n\"We've made our choice about what we think is a fruitful way to describe the results,\" he said, adding that while practical applications remain elusive, the findings open new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena.\n\n\"I'll be honest, I don't currently have a path from what we've been looking at toward applications,\" he admitted. \"We're going to keep thinking about it, but I don't want to get people's hopes up.\"\n\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse"

            "article_content": "Cai Meng/China Daily\n\nThe Trump White House is likely to ignite another round of inflation in new trade and tech wars. And that could drive US-China ties to the edge.\n\nWho do I call when I want to talk to Europe? Kissinger once quipped highlighting the internal divides of the old continent. Today, he'd have a similar problem calling America.\n\nIn recent weeks, President Biden has yielded spotlight to Trump who has talked with foreign leaders like President Macron and Ukraine's Zelensky, while commenting on Syrian turmoil before Biden. After Trump's meetings with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, trade and immigration policy are already out of Biden's hands.\n\nSince 2021 Biden has missed the opportunity to reset Trump's policies. Now he could have used the transition period to warn Americans of the impending Trump's revolution, whick risks disrupting domestic politics and US-China ties.\n\nTrump's triple inflation risks\n\nIf the 2021-23 inflation surge in America killed Biden's second term by instigating widespread voter frustration, Trump's economic agenda is likely to pose a triple threat to US price stability.\n\nThe expected broad tax cuts will compound the already-huge federal deficits and debt, thereby exacerbating inflation. The possible effort to reduce the independence of the Federal Reserve would further foster inflation.\n\nThe second likely source of inflation would be the Trump's pledge to initiate the \"massive\" deportation process, alongside other restrictive immigration policies. Not only would that effort divide Americans, reinforce xenophobia and white nationalism, it would likely disrupt US labor markets, which rely on foreign-born workers, particularly in construction, agriculture and hospitality.\n\nAdditionally, such policies would encourage another ugly wave of anti-Asian sentiment that America witnessed in the Trump era and Biden's protectionism has continued to inflame. It would undermine Chinese immigrant talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Darkly reminiscent of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, America First translates to deporting the Chinese first. The Trump White House needs to scapegoat an \"enemy\" for its policy failures.\n\nThird, Trump seeks to integrate the barely-regulated cryptocurrencies into America's financial and fiscal systems thus opening the henhouse to crypto-foxes. It is a self-interested policy of the Trump oligarchs. The unregulated crypto-sphere, if fully executed, could cause high volatility in the financial markets. By potentially facilitating illicit activities such as money laundering, dark financing and diminishing the Fed's influence over the economy, it could disrupt the dollar hegemony in the world economy.\n\nHence, too, the president-elect's recent threat of 100% tariff on BRICS countries if they pursue creating new currency. In reality, the 34-country bloc is more interested in trading with their own local currencies than a bloc-wide currency. But Trump's economic coercion is a taste of things to come.\n\nTrade and technology wars\n\nSince American hegemony can no longer rely on US dominance in the increasingly multipolar world economy, Washington relies increasingly on trade wars, sanctions and geopolitics to retain that supremacy.\n\nIf the triple inflation threat associated with the Trump White House will materialize, the Fed will slow its rate cuts or return to tightening. That will push up the dollar, which could destabilize international currencies, including the Chinese yuan. When trade tensions take off, economic uncertainty and market volatility will increase worldwide, including Chinese stock market. As investors' risk appetite decreases, markets face downward pressures.\n\nThe Trump administration will exploit sanctions to decouple bilateral high-tech ties with China, especially by targeting semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum technology, possibly advanced manufacturing and biotech. Such measures increase costs in high-tech over time but won't immediately affect daily living costs in the US.\n\nHence the attractiveness of such measures to Trump's trade authorities, including the new trade representative Jamieson Greer, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of ex-trade czar Robert Lighthizer. Greer used to represent US Steel in a lawsuit against China. Rewarded for his loyalty in the Capitol attack four years ago, the Sinophobic Peter Navarro will be Trump's new senior counselor for trade and manufacturing.\n\nAlthough the tough-and-rough Lighthizer managed to sell tariffs to Wall Street during the Trump's first administration, he has now been played out. Treasury Secretary pick Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary selection Howard Lutnick and Kevin Hassett, the new head of the National Economic Council, are all seen as business-friendly establishment figures. But each supports tariff and tech wars as well.\n\nUnlike Lighthizer who saw tariffs as across-the-board duties to resolve America's chronic trade deficits, the Wall Streeters are more likely to use tariffs \"strategically\" on certain products and as a cudgel to coerce other nations to accede to Trump's demands.\n\nChina's counter-measures\n\nAs demonstrated by the just concluded Central Economic Work Conference, China has been preparing for Trump's trade wars. Among priorities for economic policy in 2025, policymakers emphasize the need to maintain stable growth, employment and commodity prices, through steps like higher deficit-to-GDP ratios, rate cuts and the issuance of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, China was the primary tariff target. Now Trump says he will enact a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office, and raise tariffs on goods from China by 10 percent. He has advocated 60-100 percent tariffs on imports from China and 10-20 percent tariffs on imports from all other countries, including allies. The \"spread effect\" could dilute some of the adverse impact on China. Moreover, like seven years ago, US importers have been busy trying to frontload their China purchases to reduce the impact of the impending tariffs. The proposed tariff effect is thus more likely to materialize in 2025-26.\n\nSecond, Chinese economy has changed. In 2017, it was more reliant on US as an export destination. For two decades, China was the top exporter of goods into the US and even in 2022 bilateral trade was still at a record high. Now Mexico has overtaken China's role. Today, the US attracts less than 15 percent of Chinese exports, whereas ASEAN and the EU account over 16 percent and less than 15 percent, respectively. The EU will seek to emulate the US tariffs, but prefers targeted rather than across-the-board tariffs.\n\nThird, China was more dependent on exports in 2017. Today, China is world-class science leader and benefits from more diversified innovation. I am currently touring in Guangdong's Greater Bay Area. In the \"Chinese Silicon Valley,\" research and development (R&D) as of GDP is over 2.4 percent; higher than in France. In Shenzhen, it is over 6.5 percent; more than in any country.\n\nTrue, China is still developing manufacturing processes for advanced semiconductors; a key target of US export controls. But now it is leading in electric vehicles, automotive software and lithium battery technology. Moreover, China's LNG shipbuilding and high-speed rail industries are on track to hit targets. It produces the world's most efficient and lowest-cost solar panels, along with innovative drugs.\n\nHardball or dialogue\n\nRecently, the Politburo, China's top decision-making body, opted to respond more actively to economic downturns, boost demand and stabilize the housing market. Fiscal easing is augmented by \"moderately loose\" monetary policy next year. The decision to foster \"unconventional\" counter-cyclical adjustments is the greatest policy shift since 2008.\n\nHowever, China too can play the tit-for-tat trade games, even if reluctantly. On Dec 2, Washington added more than 100 Chinese companies to a restricted trade list and banned the sale to China of some of the fastest semiconductors and the equipment to make them. China responded by banning US exports of rare minerals - gallium, germanium, and antimony - and other items.\n\nIt was the first time China included a broad ban on so-called transshipment in a government regulation on exports. US sources estimate the likely total cost from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at over $3 billion. Moreover, Beijing has begun an antimonopoly investigation into Nvidia, the US giant dominating the world market for the advanced chips needed for AI.\n\nDoes this mean China has opted for those geopolitical divides in the global economy that Trump and Biden have supported in the past seven years? No. It is a signal to the incoming Trump administration that unilateralism has no future in a multipolar global economy. It is still a move to begin dialogue - unless the Trump White House chooses otherwise.\n\nDr Dan Steinbock is the founder of Difference Group and has served at the India, China and America Institute (US), Shanghai Institute for International Studies (China) and the EU Center (Singapore).
