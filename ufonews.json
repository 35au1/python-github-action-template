It's hard to know where to start: should I start with the first? Should I choose at random? Since the default list order runs chronologically, should I play the last, because that one might represent the creative apex of fictional studio UFOSoft?\n\nIt doesn't really matter, in the end, because there's a lot. I've been absorbed by point 'n' click horror Night Manor for the past few days, but when I first booted the game I got sucked into Barbuta and Bushido Ball and neglected the other 48 games for days. I've gone through a Walforf's Journey phase too, and I've completed some levels in Camouflage and Block Koala. I've definitely not completed any of the games.\n\nNo one should feel bad or slow for not completing any UFO 50 games as yet because, during a recent chat with the Mossmouth team, I learned that no one on the team has completed all the games either. And they made it.\n\n\"No, not at all,\" Eirik Suhrke said when I asked if he (or anyone else) had finished all the games. \"It's too much. We all similarly played all of them a little bit, but yeah, I've been watching stuff on Twitch and just seeing new stuff constantly. No one has the full picture.\"\n\nUFO 50's Paul Hubans said he hasn't even played past the first level of Campanella 3, for example, despite having invested \"hundreds of hours\" testing the collection in addition to being a designer.\n\n\"You need to focus on one level (game) at a time,\" Suhrke went on. \"You've got to just black out 49 other games for a little while in order to make any progress. Whenever I thought about the whole thing I would get very dizzy and overwhelmed and I'd have to go for a walk and then just try to block out as much of it as I could. It's only now that I'm seeing the full power of the whole thing come together.\"\n\nTyriq Plummer says that the way early players are reacting to the game\u2013their surprise at its extent\u2013is close to how he himself felt when he saw how it finally came together. \"It's one of those things where even though it's such a large and broad encompassing kind of project, it still manages to feel more than the sum of its parts,\" he said. \"And that's something that was hard to get a sense of when I was working on it. But everyone else is saying now that there's way more to this than I even realized. It's super cool.\"\n\nDerek Yu agrees. \"I think that's always the best, when you're surprised by the game that you're working on, and I think that's partly why it's been so enjoyable to work on it for all these years. We're constantly sharing and surprising each other.\"\n\nAccording to our review UFO 50 is a \"a superb retro-style smorgasbord\". I spoke at length with most of the Mossmouth team earlier this week, and you can read all about that here."

        "source": "Popular Mechanics",
        "article_content": "Soon after clicking around America\u2019s new online database containing hundreds of thousands of historical UFO records, you may begin to wonder why the government has spent a lot of time and taxpayer dollars collecting data on a phenomenon that it doesn\u2019t seem to believe in.\n\nAs a casual observer taking a quick look at the database\u2014an ongoing project of the National Archives, the government\u2019s repository of historical documents\u2014you\u2019ll see many images of fake-looking flying saucers. You\u2019ll hear recordings of military personnel talking at length about various sightings, concluding that there was no credible evidence that what was observed was a UFO. You\u2019ll find a ton of grainy images and films of bright dots in the sky, as well as black-and-white 20th-century newsreel footage.\n\nBut if you dig around the somewhat clunky database, you might also discover some intriguing records. For example, a 2013 blog post mentioning a Popular Mechanics news brief that same year about an Air Force project to build a flying saucer. Surely, that would pique your interest.\n\n\u201cThe Air Force, especially, has spent a significant amount of time trying to say \u2018there is nothing here,\u2019\u201d and yet it and other government agencies have continued to investigate UAP reports, says Robert Powell, an engineer and author of UFOs: A Scientist Explains What We Know (And Don\u2019t Know).\n\n\u201cWhy would you collect all that information if you did not believe there was something to at least a portion of it? \u2026 You\u2019ll see some really interesting reports there in that data that indicate there\u2019s something to the whole UAP subject, but you have to look for it,\u201d says Powell, who is also co-founder of the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU), a nonprofit that includes scientists and researchers who apply scientific methods to the analysis of UFO sightings.\n\nLAST FEBRUARY, AT THE DIRECTION OF CONGRESS, the Archives launched the giant database, which will eventually collect records from across all federal agencies of sightings related to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), the government\u2019s term for UFOs. At present, however, it only contains some of the UAP records\u2014including photographs, moving images, and microfilm\u2014that the Archives already has on hand that have at this point been digitized.\n\nMore records are slated to be added as the agency continues the process of digitizing its own files, and more still will be added once the Air Force, NASA, and other U.S. government agencies start to digitize copies of their own records for transfer to the Archives and eventual online public disclosure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for the scientific community to have open access to information,\u201d says Powell. He points to the huge amount of data now on the hub and says it\u2019s of immense value to have it all gathered into one place and online.\n\nWhile many scientists and researchers over the years have found that the vast majority of reports of sightings are misidentifications of known objects, they agree that there remain some reports \u201cthat cannot be reasonably explained as terrestrial or astronomical objects,\u201d Powell says, adding that military and government leaders have also acknowledged this over the decades.\n\nUnlike the long-running sci-fi television classic The X-Files, in which FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder tries to expose what he believes is a massive government UFO cover-up, the endgame for the database is improving transparency for the public. At least, sort of.\n\nTo some extent, Mulder may have been right, as evidenced by ongoing calls from Washington lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle for the Executive Branch to declassify government UAP records.\n\n\u201cCongress recognizes that these records, if they exist, were likely concealed under the good faith goal of protecting national security. However, hiding that information from both Congress and the public at large is simply unacceptable,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) said in a statement last year. The senators made the statement as they introduced an initial version of a bill that was amended and eventually adopted into the law calling for the creation of a UAP collection hub.\n\nUnder law, the government may postpone public release of certain records for 25 years from the date they were first created. The president must certify that a postponement is necessary due to a risk of harming military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations, or that there is an identifiable harm so grave that it outweighs the public interest in disclosing the information.\n\n\u201cThe American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence and unexplainable phenomena,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe are not only working to declassify what the government has previously learned about these phenomena but to create a pipeline for future research to be made public.\u201d\n\nBefore the UAP hub went live, the public would have had to visit one of the Archives\u2019 physical research locations to view, for example, the Air Force\u2019s files on the long-running Project Blue Book UFO investigation that ended in 1969. Now those files are just a few clicks away in the database.\n\nHow to Use the UAP Records Collection Hub The National Archives is continuing to add records of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), more commonly known as UFOs, to its online hub as it digitizes more of the records in its holdings, says Chris Naylor, executive for Research Services at the Archives.\n\n\n\nLaunched in February 2024, the hub now holds hundreds of thousands of those records, but this number will exponentially increase as more of the Archives\u2019 UAP records are digitized and as other government agencies and the presidential libraries begin the process of digitizing their own holdings and transferring them to the Archives.\n\n\n\nThe process may take some time due to the massive volume of records on file, Naylor says. Barring classified or otherwise potentially sensitive information, the goal is to create a complete catalog of all of the government\u2019s UAP records.\n\n\n\nTo find the hub, start at the National Archives homepage at www.archives.gov and click the Research Our Records tab. From there, scroll down to Research a Specific Topic , where you\u2019ll find the Foreign Affairs, Military Records & Investigations box with a link to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs) . This is the hub\u2019s homepage for the Archives\u2019 massive database of UAP records.\n\n\n\nThe hub is divvied up into five broad categories of UAP-related records:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Still Picture and Photographs\n\n\u2022 Moving Images and Sound\n\n\u2022 Textural Records and Microfilm\n\n\u2022 Presidential Library, and\n\n\u2022 National Archives Blog Posts and Articles\n\n\n\nWithin each category are numbered titles of record groups (RG), the first under the Still Picture category is (RG 255) relating to NASA\u2019s records, for example. Click on the first hyperlink, \u201cFlying Saucer (photograph No. 255-GS-65-107) , and you\u2019ll be taken to the image along with links to more items in the group and series. You can also perform searches within some Record Groups and Series by using the blue search box at the top left of those pages. What you\u2019ll find as you drill down from record groups to individual items depends on what has been digitized by the date and time when you look. \u2014E.D.\n\nOver the years, the Archives has collected a significant volume of records that relate to government investigations of UAP sightings, says Chris Naylor, executive for Research Services at the Archives. Last year, it began to identify and then digitize those holdings in support of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) , a Department of Defense unit created by the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2022 to work across federal agencies to investigate UAPs.\n\nThat work continues today in accordance with the NDAA of 2024 , which required the Archives to establish the collection of UAP records. Barring classified or otherwise potentially sensitive information, the Archives aims to bring together all that the government agencies\u2014as well as the presidential libraries\u2014have concerning UAPs into a central repository that can be viewed online anywhere, Naylor says.\n\n\u201cThe intent and goal of this Act is for agencies to identify specific documents or items \u2026 not necessarily a whole series [or records of a project] that may not be relevant,\u201d Naylor explains. An agency may, for example, have volumes of information on a single project that itself has nothing to do with UAPs but, nevertheless, contains one item that is relevant. That single item would be copied and digitized for the UAP hub.\n\nAgencies have an October 20 deadline to identify and prepare their records for transfer to the Archives, which will work with them on the process, Naylor says. He did not provide a timeline on when those records would begin to be uploaded to the public site.\n\nTechnology in the Sky\n\nUAP sightings have, indeed, been reported throughout history but it wasn\u2019t until the late 1940s that the U.S. government, through the Air Force, embarked on a series of dedicated UFO research projects.\n\n\u201cUAP research is often inconclusive, and our ability to explain these events seems to have become less easily resolved as our technology has advanced and our air activity has increased,\u201d says Richard Medina, lead author of a study on how local may influence the number of reports on sightings.\n\nThat may be because of a lack of funding in this area to conduct the necessary research, says Medina, a University of Utah associate professor of geography.\n\n, University of Louisville researchers Marissa Yingling and Charlton Yingling surveyed 1,460 U.S. academics about UAPs. They found that 19 percent of respondents reported that they or someone they know has witnessed UAPs and that 64 percent considered academia\u2019s involvement in UAP-related research to be very important or absolutely essential.\n\n\u201cI think we did not anticipate the interest and enthusiasm that we have received from professors around the world in a wide variety of disciplines about this topic,\u201d says Charlton Yingling, an associate professor of history.\n\nIn a , he says he found that academics more frequently reported some degree of concern for social, rather than professional, repercussions or ridicule about UAP research topics. Some were, nevertheless, also concerned about professional repercussions.\n\nLawmakers have also raised stigma concerns, as have former military personnel who shared their experiences with UAPs at a House Oversight Subcommittee hearing last year.\n\n\u201cPilots have reported encounters for years. Because of the stigma around reporting these incidents, we still do not have a complete picture of actually what is going on,\u201d Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said at the hearing. \u201cI hear over and over from many agencies the stigma around reporting and investigating UAPs prevents us from getting real answers. We know that whistleblowers have reported harassment, intimidation or stigma as well, and this is not acceptable.\u201d\n\nSome researchers echo that sentiment and say that the government\u2019s efforts to become more involved with projects like the database may help the subject matter to be taken more seriously.\n\nThe database will help somewhat in reducing the social stigma around UAPs, Powell says. \u201cI won\u2019t say that it\u2019ll go a long way [to changing opinions], but it\u2019s another step in the right direction,\u201d he says.\n\nMedina is more concerned with the long view. \u201cJust putting together a database or a collection hub isn\u2019t going to solve the problem [in that it is] not going to tell us what these things are that people are seeing,\u201d he says. More research funding is the best bet to help address that issue, he adds. And while lawmakers are helping to drive funding to this area, there\u2019s more work to be done.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more technology in the sky than ever before,\u201d he says, \u201cand we\u2019re still just as confused as we were years ago.\u201d\n\n"

Chopra joins the likes of Judy Garland, James Dean, Burt Reynolds, and Sir Laurence Olivier as a celebrity voice, though he is the first still-living person who has signed up to have his synthetic avatar read digital texts.\n\nChopra has been a leader in promoting meditation and mindfulness for decades and is also taking the lead in deploying a voice clone of himself. A few months ago, ElevenLabs and Chopra produced a virtual Chopra chatbot called Digital Deepak. Trained on Chopra\u2019s collected speeches, books, interviews, and other comments, Digital Deepak acts as a limited but still knowledgeable source for Chopra\u2019s thinking. You can ask Digital Deepak about himself and his work and get personalized responses from his AI voice clone.\n\nThe success of Digital Deepak is what led to Chopra and ElevenLabs extending their partnership to the Reader App. The Reader app uses voice clones like Chopra\u2019s to perform any uploaded text. It will read the words and mimic human emotion based on the context.\n\nThose interested in hearing the voices can try the ElevenLabs Reader app for free for three months or subscribe to ElevenLabs\u2019 platform to gain access to the iOS or Android app. ElevenLabs has suggested that using celebrity voices will enhance any listening experience. Chopra\u2019s inclusion with the Hollywood Golden Age stars suggests it won\u2019t just be for entertainment but also for deeper topics.\n\nChopra Speaks\n\n\u201cI am proud to announce my partnership with ElevenLabs. Listening can help cultivate emotional nurturing and engagement. This is no different in the age of AI, it is only more important,\u201d said Chopra. \u201cI have always written to connect with people, and now I can connect on a deeper level with a global audience as I make my teachings available for everyone in my own voice.\u201d\n\nPerformers have expressed concern that AI will leave them out of a job since it can recreate their look and sound far more cheaply. Meta has already proven it will pay big bucks to get celebrities to voice the Meta AI assistant, and Disney ensured it had a deal with James Earl Jones before he passed to legally recreate his voice if they want Darth Vader in future projects. Recent actor union strikes have made stronger protections against unfair AI replication of their performances part of their bargains. For now, ElevenLabs wants people to see Chopra and other famous voices as a way to create deeper connections with people they respect, even if it\u2019s all synthetic.\n\n\u201cAt ElevenLabs, we\u2019re committed to preserving and celebrating cultural legacies while pushing the boundaries of technology,\u201d said Dustin Blank, Head of Partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cBy bringing voices like Deepak Chopra to our platform, we\u2019re not just enhancing our app \u2013 we\u2019re creating new ways for people to connect with the most influential figures and their work.\u201d\n\nYou might also like"

        "article_content": "These two companies are each worth under $4 billion, but they're packed with potential.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon have become synonymous with artificial intelligence (AI). These trillion-dollar giants are among the highest-quality companies investors can buy, but smaller names can represent promising AI opportunities as well.\n\nC3.ai (AI -0.62%) was one of the world's first enterprise AI companies when it was founded in 2009, and SoundHound AI (SOUN -2.65%) has become a leader in conversational AI. The latter has even won the endorsement of Nvidia, which purchased a stake in the company late last year.\n\nC3.ai and SoundHound have market capitalizations of $3.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, but they could soar in value as the AI revolution unfolds.\n\n1. C3.ai: A unique enterprise AI company\n\nOracle chairman Larry Ellison recently said the cost to build a true, cutting-edge frontier AI model from scratch could exceed $100 billion. That's why many businesses choose to use completed models from third parties like OpenAI or Anthropic when creating AI software. However, with C3.ai, they can skip that step entirely (depending on their needs).\n\nC3.ai offers a portfolio of over 40 finished AI applications, which can be customized to suit almost any business in as little as three months from the date of the first meeting. In fact, the company has customers in 19 different industries, including financial services, manufacturing, and oil and gas, to name a few.\n\nOne of the world's largest chemical manufacturers, Dow, uses the C3.ai Reliability platform for predictive maintenance. It has achieved a 20% reduction in equipment downtime, which is such a strong result that it's rolling the software out to more of its assets.\n\nC3.ai sells its AI applications directly to customers, but it also sells them jointly with the cloud divisions of tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. It's a win-win for all parties -- the cloud providers can offer their customers more choice when it comes to AI, and C3.ai gains access to a large pool of businesses to which it can potentially sell its software. During its fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended July 31), C3.ai's partner network accounted for 72% of its deal flow, making it a valuable sales channel.\n\nThe company generated a record $87.2 million in revenue during the quarter, up 21% from the year-ago period. That marked the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth as the company reaps the benefits of its shift to consumption-based pricing that was put into motion two years ago. Based on management's guidance, revenue growth could accelerate yet again in the fiscal second quarter.\n\nC3.ai stock is trading more than 85% below its all-time high, which was set during the tech frenzy in 2020. It was unquestionably overvalued back then when its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio topped 80. It has now come down to a more reasonable 9.1, below its three-year average of 10.5. That's still a premium valuation, but you can arguably justify it with the company's accelerating revenue growth.\n\n2. SoundHound AI: A leader in conversational AI\n\nLike C3.ai, SoundHound AI has also developed a portfolio of AI tools for businesses. It focuses on conversational AI applications that are capable of voice-based interactions with their users, making them highly useful in places like restaurants or inside your car.\n\nSoundHound allows restaurants to accept customer orders using AI, whether it's in-store, over the phone, or in the drive thru, with no human input required. Plus, its Employee Assist software can converse with workers about store policies or even provide instructions on how to make certain menu items.\n\nSeveral popular restaurant chains use SoundHound's products, including Chipotle Mexican Grill, Papa Johns, and Beef 'O' Brady's. The latter just rolled out AI ordering across all of its corporate locations, and it's also giving franchisees the option to use it.\n\nSoundHound's Chat AI voice assistant is popular in the automotive industry. It's already live across six brands under the Stellantis umbrella, and it's capable of providing drivers with information on a range of topics from sports scores to the status of an upcoming flight. SoundHound uses Nvidia's Drive platform to power its voice interface, which allows Chat AI to function even when there is no internet or cellular connectivity. So, not only did Nvidia buy a small stake in SoundHound, but the two companies are also closely working together.\n\nSoundHound generated $45.9 million in revenue in 2023, and management's guidance calls for the top line to grow 74% to $80 million this year. The company's outlook also anticipates growth accelerating in 2025 as revenue hits $150 million.\n\nPart of the strong forecast is attributable to SoundHound's recent acquisition of Amelia, an AI company that helps businesses create AI agents to serve their customers and employees. Amelia is expected to contribute $45 million to SoundHound's revenue next year, which is included in the above forecast. The acquisition will expand SoundHound's reach into new industries like healthcare, financial services, and insurance.\n\nSoundHound stock trades at a P/S ratio of 23.9 as of this writing, nearly triple the valuation of C3.ai stock. While that's expensive, its P/S ratio shrinks to 11.5 based on management's 2025 revenue outlook. That said, investors will need to adopt a long-term mindset as SoundHound rides the tailwinds from the ongoing advancement of AI technology."

        "article_content": "Wordy is a new iOS app that offers a unique way to learning English. The app automatically translates and defines unknown words while you watch your favorite movies or TV shows. Wordy has over 500,000 titles available, including popular series such as HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Penguin\u201d and the new Disney+ show, \u201cAgatha All Along.\u201d\n\nCreated by indie developer S\u00e1ndor Bogy\u00f3, a 23-year-old from Budapest, the app was born out of his frustration with looking up unfamiliar phrases in his non-native language while watching shows in English. His experience with Language Reactor, a Chrome extension similar to Wordy, led him to realize the need for a mobile app that would make it easier to use his phone while watching TV or using the computer.\n\nWhen a user selects an episode from Wordy\u2019s library, the AI analyzes the subtitles, then extracts and lemmatizes each word. Using your phone\u2019s microphone, a custom speech recognition model identifies spoken sentences from the audio coming from the TV or computer. This helps the app find where you are in the episode and follow along, scrolling down the transcript and highlighting certain words that may be difficult for non-native English speakers. When a new word appears, you can quickly glance at your phone for the translation.\n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a summary page for each episode, allowing you to view every word at once, which are sorted by difficulty level: Proficiency English, Advanced English, Upper-intermediate, Intermediate, Elementary, and Beginner. Wordy also provides the option to save words to your Library and practice them later using digital flashcards.\n\nImage Credits: Wordy\n\nWordy uses a combination of its proprietary and third-party AI models. Bogy\u00f3 explained to TechCrunch that it leverages the largest open movie database, TMDB, for film and series data, along with OpenSubtitles.com via their API, which he has found to provide the most accurate and reliable subtitles.\n\nDuring our testing, we opened the app on our phone while watching Netflix\u2019s hit TV show, \u201cWednesday\u201d on a laptop. Wordy pointed out terms like \u201cplagued,\u201d \u201cnefarious,\u201d and \u201cs\u00e9ance,\u201d which are more sophisticated vocabulary that beginners just learning the language may not know. We found that the translations were accurate and easy to understand.\n\nOne caveat is that it\u2019s currently only available in English, whereas rival Language Reactor supports all the major languages. Bogy\u00f3 assured us that he is working on adding more languages. He plans to integrate Spanish into the app in November, with French and German to follow in the coming months.\n\n\u201cI prefer to maintain quality over rushing the process, so I\u2019m taking the time to ensure each language integration meets my standards for accuracy and user experience,\u201d he said.\n\nThe app costs $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year. An Android version will launch in November."

Another legend states the creature is so horrible to behold that people jump from the trestle in fear to escape it.\n\nMore:Just Askin' | What is the Pope Lick Monster? What to know about the Louisville urban legend\n\nWhere did the Pope Lick Monster come from?\n\nVarious accounts about the beast's origin differ. Some claim that the monster was originally a circus worker who swore to take revenge after being mistreated, while others claim it's a twisted reincarnation of a farmer that sacrificed animals to gain supernatural powers.\n\nThe myth gained some notoriety when Louisville-based filmmaker Ron Schildknecht released a 16-minute film in December 1988 titled \"The Legend of the Pope Lick Monster.\" In the film, a group of teenagers go to the trestle as part of a rite of passage and one of the characters comes face-to-face with the title beast just before a train comes into view. The teen barely survives by managing to hold on to a railroad tie while the train rumbles above him.\n\nConcerns about the film influencing children to attempt to cross the 90-foot high trestle prompted Schildknecht to submit a letter to the editor to The Courier Journal in 1989, in which he stated teenagers crossing the trestle had been a common occurrence in Louisville for generations, but little had been done by parents and teachers to discourage them from avoiding the dangers.\n\n\"My interest in producing this film was to examine the reasons for such behavior and place them in the proper sociological context in hopes of dealing with the problem with a deeper understanding of the factors involved,\" he wrote. \"In depicting high school students engaged in rowdy behavior, I am saying that this is how it happens, these are the circumstances and this is what it can lead to.\"\n\nHas anyone been hurt trying to walk the train trestle?\n\nYes, in fact at least two people have been struck and killed by a train since 2016 \u2014 a 26-year-old Ohio woman and a 15-year-old from Louisville.\n\nHow can I watch the \"Out There: Crimes of the Paranormal\"\n\nHulu and Disney+ subscribers will be able to watch all eight episodes of the series starting Tuesday. The third episode is titled \"The Pope Lick Goatman.\" Other episodes feature investigations of a supposed UFO crash in Long Island and ghosts believed to haunt San Francisco's Chinatown.\n\n\"Out There\" was produced by the creative team behind the \"Sasquatch\" series, also available on Hulu.\n\nReach reporter Leo Bertucci at lbertucci@gannett.com or @leober2chee on X, formerly known as Twitter"

I\u2019m scared to open them.\u201d \u2013 Heather Donahue in \u201cThe Blair Witch Project.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a funny thing with memory \u2014 how your mind\u2019s eye can produce a clear picture of a relatively minor moment in your life from 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, but you can\u2019t instantly recall what you had for lunch last Monday or what you did two Sundays ago.\n\nHere\u2019s something I remember from late summer 1999. On a sunny weekday afternoon, I was walking across the Wabash Avenue Bridge, returning to the Sun-Times building after having watched an advance screening of \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d \u2014 and I could still feel the chills from the experience. That movie scared the life out of me.\n\nOver the years, it\u2019s become somewhat fashionable to dis \u201cThe Blair Witch Project,\u201d to wonder what all the hype was about, to call it underwhelming. In a 2022 poll for the Scotsman, readers called it the most overrated film of all time. A 2019 article in Collider about underrated and overrated horror films placed \u201cBlair Witch\u201d in the latter category. Threads on Reddit dis the movie.\n\n\u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d (available for streaming on Peacock) will screen Tuesday at Landmark at the Glen in Glenview as part of the \u201cRetro Replay 1999 \u2014 The Year That Changed Cinema\u201d series. In advance of this, I rewatched the film for the first time in many years \u2014 and while I wouldn\u2019t say the chill is gone, it is somewhat lessened. (I mean, you can only see something for the first time once. Right?)\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because we\u2019ve had so many \u201cfound footage\u201d movies over the last 25 years, including the \u201cParanormal Activity\u201d franchise, \u201cThe Last Exorcism\u201d and \u201cCloverfield,\u201d among others. (\u201cBlair Witch\u201d wasn\u2019t the first in the genre, though it remains the most successful of all time, with a box-office gross of $248.6 million worldwide, which would be $469 million in today\u2019s dollars.) Perhaps it\u2019s because I knew what was coming this time around, and I couldn\u2019t totally buy into the concept that the trio of filmmakers lost deep in the woods and terrified to the point of hysteria would keep the cameras rolling until ... well. The end.\n\n\u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d directors Eduardo Sanchez (left) and Daniel Myrick creep around at the Cannes International Film Festival in 1999. Roger Ebert/Sun-Times\n\nStill, I admired the vision and the skills of the directing duo of Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez, who came up with this concept and brought it to fruition on a budget of just $60,000, on a shoot that lasted only eight days. Their use of sound in particular contributed greatly to the feeling there was something out there, something just beyond the camera\u2019s reach. There were still a few moments that sent shivers down my spine \u2014 and those moments were produced by the screams in the blackness, the muffled cries for help, even the snapping of twigs in the dead of night. Like so many of the best scary movies, \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d is more about what we don\u2019t see.\n\nI was also impressed by the performances of Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard as the aspiring documentarians who hike into the haunted woods near Burkitsville, Maryland, in 1994 and are never heard from again. They probably haven\u2019t received enough credit for their acting, in part because they went by their real names and the whole concept behind the film was that they weren\u2019t acting, they were just being themselves. (Leonard, Williams and Donahue, who legally changed her name to Rei Hance in 2020, have called for further compensation for their work on the original as well as consultation considerations for any reboots and sequels.)\n\nLike his castmates, Joshua Leonard used his own name when playing the cameraman in \u201cThe Blair Witch Project.\u201d Artisan Entertainment\n\nAnother clever touch: shooting the \u201cdocumentary\u201d footage in black and white, while the behind-the-scenes scenes are in color, recorded by a shaky, hand-held video camera. Switching back and forth adds to the feeling someone actually did find both the cameras and their contents a few years later.\n\nThe legacy of \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d is also about the revolutionary viral marketing campaign. Long before the film was released, directors Myrick and S\u00e1nchez created a website filled with fictional police reports and newspaper articles, and they filmed an 8-minute mini-documentary that aired on TV in 1998. When \u201cBlair Witch\u201d played at Sundance, the actors were nowhere to be seen and weren\u2019t part of the promotional effort, and the IMDb page for the film listed the main cast as \u201cmissing, presumed dead.\u201d It was the closest thing to a \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d moment you could have in the 1990s.\n\n"

(Getty Stock Image)\n\nHow do we know how fast the universe is expanding?\n\nThere are two ways to figure out the Hubble constant - a value that describes the universe's expansion rate.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe first way is basically through the Big Bang's leftovers, which are tiny fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, astronomers figured out that this figure was roughly 46,200 mph per million light years, or about 67 kilometres per second per megaparsec (km/s/sMpc).\n\nThe second way is to use pulsating stars, also known as Cepheid variables.\n\nAstronomers use the outer layers of dying stars, which flicker like broken street lights in the distance.\n\nAdvert\n\nBy measuring its brightness, these Cepheid stars can be chained into a 'cosmic distance ladder', which allows us to look further into the past of the universe.\n\nUsing this, an exact number can be pinpointed that reveals the speed of the universe's expansion.\n\nEstimates of the universe's rate of expansion contradict each other\n\nBy using the second method, Adam Riess - professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University - and his colleagues estimated that the universe's expansion rate is actually about 74 km/s/Mpc, a value much higher than the previously thought 67 km/s/Mpc.\n\nThis could make the universe 10 percent younger than we originally thought.\n\nScientists have called it a 'crisis' (Getty Stock Image)\n\nThe world of cosmology has been catapulted into uncertainty following this discovery.\n\nNobel Prize winning astronomer David Gross called it a 'crisis' at a 2019 conference.\n\nWhat did the James Webb Space Telescope find?\n\nInitially, the discovery was thought to be a measurement error by confusing Cepheid stars with regular stars in the Hubble's lens, but the much more accurate JWST disproved these claims, confirming the new discovery.\n\nOn 6 February, a study was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, highlighting that our understanding of the universe could be very, very wrong.\n\nLead study author Riess stated: \"With measurement errors negated, what remains is the real and exciting possibility we have misunderstood the universe.\"\n\nRiess observed 1,000 other Cepheid stars in five separate galaxies as far away as 130 million lightyears from Earth, further confirming their findings on the Hubble constant.\n\nHe explained: \"We've now spanned the whole range of what Hubble observed, and we can rule out a measurement error as the cause of the Hubble Tension with very high confidence.\n\n\"Combining Webb and Hubble gives us the best of both worlds. We find that the Hubble measurements remain reliable as we climb farther along the cosmic distance ladder.\""

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nThe ML-based framework for the MOO design of RHEAs. Credit: Cheng Wen et al.\n\nIn a study recently published in Engineering, scientists from the University of Science and Technology Beijing, Guangdong Ocean University, and AiMaterials Research LLC have demonstrated a novel method to accelerate the discovery of refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) compositions optimized for extreme conditions.\n\nThe research, titled \"Machine-Learning-Assisted Compositional Design of Refractory High-Entropy Alloys with Optimal Strength and Ductility,\" outlines how machine-learning (ML), genetic search, cluster analysis, and experimental design were employed to sift through billions of possible compositions and identify those with superior mechanical properties.\n\nThe research team, led by Turab Lookman and Yanjing Su, synthesized and tested 24 different alloy compositions through a rigorous iterative process involving six feedback loops. Their efforts resulted in four compositions demonstrating remarkable high-temperature yield strength and room-temperature ductility. Among these, the ZrNbMoHfTa alloy system, specifically the composition Zr 0.13 Nb 0.27 Mo 0.26 Hf 0.13 Ta 0.21 , stood out with a yield strength approaching 940 MPa at 1200 \u00b0C and a room-temperature fracture strain of 17.2%.\n\nA leap forward in high-temperature materials\n\nThe exceptional performance of the ZrNbMoHfTa alloy marks a significant advancement in materials science. Its yield strength at 1200 \u00b0C exceeds that of previous RHEAs and traditional nickel-based superalloys, which are typically limited to lower temperatures. This enhancement opens up new possibilities for high-temperature structural applications, including in gas turbines, aerospace propulsion systems, and nuclear reactors.\n\nThe integration of machine learning with traditional alloy design methods has allowed researchers to rapidly identify and optimize compositions that were previously unimaginable. This breakthrough not only addresses the limitations of existing materials but also sets a new standard for high-temperature alloys.\n\nA new paradigm for material design\n\nThe researchers' approach represents a paradigm shift in material design by effectively managing the vast compositional space of RHEAs and addressing multiple performance objectives simultaneously. By leveraging ML algorithms, the team was able to predict alloy properties with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency, overcoming common challenges such as limited data and complex optimization tasks.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of incorporating multi-objective optimization (MOO) techniques to balance various material properties, including strength, ductility, and oxidation resistance. The proposed framework's adaptability to other alloy systems demonstrates its potential to revolutionize the design of materials across different applications and industries.\n\nWhile the current study has achieved remarkable results, the researchers emphasize that there is still room for improvement and further exploration. Future work will focus on integrating additional elements to enhance properties like oxidation resistance and refining ML models to manage uncertainties and improve prediction accuracy. The study also underscores the need for efficient selection strategies, such as cluster analysis, to optimize experimental and computational costs.\n\n\"The success of this research opens new avenues for material innovation,\" noted Nan Zhang, editor of Engineering. \"As research scientists continue to refine their approach and explore new compositions, we anticipate even greater advancements in high-temperature alloys that could transform a wide range of engineering applications.\"\n\nThe paper was authored by Cheng Wen, Yan Zhang, Changxin Wang, Haiyou Huang, Yuan Wu, Turab Lookman, Yanjing Su.\n\nMore information: Cheng Wen et al, Machine-Learning-Assisted Compositional Design of Refractory High-Entropy Alloys with Optimal Strength and Ductility, Engineering (2024).

        "article_content": "Crinkles and divots in the surface of Earth on T\u00fcrkiye's Central Anatolian Plateau are the smoking gun for a newly discovered class of plate tectonics.\n\nBeneath a depression called the Konya Basin, Earth's crust is slowly dripping deeper into the planetary interior, a process that is gradually shaping the surface geology of not just the basin, but the plateau that surrounds it.\n\nIt's called lithospheric dripping, a phenomenon that has only recently been discovered here on Earth, and geologists are still figuring out the different ways it manifests.\n\n\"Looking at the satellite data, we observed a circular feature at the Konya Basin where the crust is subsiding or the basin is deepening,\" says geophysicist Julia Andersen of the University of Toronto.\n\n\"This prompted us to look at other geophysical data beneath the surface where we saw a seismic anomaly in the upper mantle and a thickened crust, telling us there is high-density material there and indicating a likely mantle lithospheric drip.\"\n\nWe have a pretty good idea of how it works. When the lower portion of Earth's rocky crust is heated to a certain temperature, it starts to go a little gooey. Then, like honey or syrup, it slowly oozes downward \u2013 a bit like a pitch drop experiment, but much bigger and slower.\n\nAs this drop descends, it pulls the planetary crust down with it. This creates a depression, or basin. Then, when the drop detaches into the mantle, the surface rebounds, bulging upwards, with a widespread effect.\n\nWe only began to understand this process a short time ago, but modeling its evolution has already allowed Andersen and her colleagues to identify one region of the mantle where dripping has taken place, at the Arizaro Basin under the Central Andes.\n\nNow, careful analysis of surface geology and laboratory experiments has led them to another oozy drip under the Central Anatolian Plateau \u2013 and the signpost was the Konya Basin.\n\nThe Central Anatolian Plateau is known to be uplifting over time. Previous research suggests that it has gained around a kilometer (0.6 miles) in altitude over the past 10 million years thanks to the release of a crusty drip.\n\nBut then there's the Konya Basin, which is subsiding downwards at a rate of around 20 millimeters (0.8 inches) per year. That doesn't sound like much, but a sinking patch of ground in a region that is rising upwards warrants further investigation.\n\nThe team's findings suggest that the broader region of the plateau is in the throes of the rebound phase of the lithospheric drip process, after having dropped its gooey molten load into the mantle. The Konya Basin? That's a smaller, second drip forming.\n\n\"As the lithosphere thickened and dripped below the region, it formed a basin at the surface that later sprang up when the weight below broke off and sank into the deeper depths of the mantle,\" says Earth scientist Russell Pysklywec of the University of Toronto.\n\n\"We now see the process is not a one-time tectonic event and that the initial drip seems to have spawned subsequent daughter events elsewhere in the region, resulting in the curious rapid subsidence of the Konya Basin within the continuously rising plateau of T\u00fcrkiye.\"\n\nThe researchers validated this model by setting up a lab experiment. They filled a plexiglass tank with a highly viscous silicone polymer called polydimethylsiloxane as a proxy for Earth's gooey lower mantle. A mixture of polydimethylsiloxane and modeling clay was used to replicate the upper mantle, while a mixture of ceramic spheres and silica sand served as the crust.\n\nThen, they inserted a dense \"seed\" into the upper mantle layer to initiate a drip, and observed the results. Within 10 hours, the first drip had started to fall. By the time it reached the bottom of the box, after about 50 hours, a secondary drip had started to descend.\n\nNeither drip was associated with horizontal deformation of the surface \u2013 only vertical. And these deformations were consistent with the Konya Basin.\n\n\"What we noticed was that over time, this secondary drip did pull the crust downward and started to create a basin, despite no horizontal movements in the crust at the surface,\" Andersen says. \"The findings show these major tectonic events are linked, with one lithospheric drip potentially triggering a host of further activity deep in the planetary interior.\"\n\nThese results suggest that lithospheric dripping is a multi-stage process, and neatly explains the strange, simultaneous uplifting and subsidence observed on the Central Anatolian Plateau.\n\nThe research has been published in Nature Communications."

Their analysis, published on September 27, 2024, revealed that the log had lost less than 5% carbon dioxide from its original state thanks to the low-permeability clay soil that covered it.\n\n\u201cThe wood is nice and solid\u2014you could probably make a piece of furniture out of it,\u201d Zeng noted.\n\nUnderstanding the unique environmental factors that kept that ancient log in mint condition could help researchers perfect an emerging climate solution known as \u201cwood vaulting,\u201d which involves taking wood that is not commercially viable\u2014such as trees destroyed by disease or wildfires, old furniture or unused construction materials\u2014and burying it to stop its decomposition.\n\nTrees naturally sequester carbon dioxide\u2014a potent planet-warming gas\u2014for as long as they live, making tree-planting projects a popular method of mitigating climate change. But on the flip side, when trees die and decompose, that greenhouse gas is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to think, \u2018Who doesn\u2019t know how to dig a hole and bury some wood?\u2019\u201d Zeng said. \u201cBut think about how many wooden coffins were buried in human history. How many of them survived? For a timescale of hundreds or thousands of years, we need the right conditions.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, while conducting a wood vaulting pilot project in Quebec, Canada, Zeng discovered the 3,775-year-old log that became the focus of the Science study\u2014a chance encounter that for Zeng felt \u201ckind of miraculous.\u201d While digging a trench to bury fresh wood, Zeng and other researchers spotted the log about 6.5 feet below the surface.\n\n\u201cWhen the excavator pulled a log out of the ground and threw it over to us, the three ecologists that I had invited from McGill University immediately identified it as Eastern red cedar,\u201d Zeng recalled. \u201cYou could tell how well it was preserved. I remember standing there thinking, \u2018Wow, here\u2019s the evidence that we need!\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile past studies have analyzed old samples of preserved wood, they tended to overlook the surrounding soil conditions, according to Zeng.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of geological and archeological evidence of preserved wood from hundreds to millions of years ago, but the focus of those studies was not \u2018How we can engineer a wood vault to preserve that wood?\u2019\u201d Zeng said. \u201cAnd the problem with designing a new experiment is that we can\u2019t wait 100 years for the results.\u201d\n\nShortly after the Quebec dig, UMD\u2019s collaborators at MAPAQ, a government ministry in Montreal, conducted carbon dating to determine the log\u2019s age. Then, in 2021, Distinguished University Professor Liangbing Hu in UMD\u2019s Department of Materials Science and Engineering helped Zeng analyze the 3,775-year-old sample\u2019s microscopic structure, chemical composition, mechanical strength and density. They then compared those results to that of a freshly cut Eastern red cedar log, which revealed that the older sample had lost very little carbon dioxide.\n\nThe type of soil covering the log was the key reason for its remarkable preservation. The clay soil in that part of Quebec had an especially low permeability, meaning that it prevented or drastically slowed oxygen from reaching the log while also keeping out fungi and insects, the decomposers typically found in soil.\n\nBecause clay soil is common, wood vaulting could become a viable and low-cost option in many parts of the world. As a climate solution, Zeng noted that wood vaulting is best paired with other tactics to slow global warming, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAs he and his colleagues continue to optimize wood vaulting, he looks forward to putting what they\u2019ve learned into practice to help curb climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite an exciting discovery,\u201d Zeng said of this latest study. \u201cThe urgency of climate change has become such a prominent issue, so there was even more motivation to get this analysis going.\u201d\n\n###\n\nIn addition to Zeng and Hu, co-authors of this study included Laura Picard (B.S. \u201924, chemistry; B.S. \u201924, animal sciences), undergraduate student Elisa Zeng-Mariotti from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and Ph.D. student Bryson Clifford and postdocs He Liu, Yu Liu, Taotao Meng and Xinpeng Zhao from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.\n\nTheir study, \u201c3775-year-old wood burial supports \u2018wood vaulting\u2019 as a durable carbon removal method,\u201d was published in Science on September 27, 2024.\n\nThis study was supported by MAPAQ, the NOAA Climate Program Office and the NIST Greenhouse Gas Measurement Program.

This reduces the amount of miscommunication that might occur when trying to explain the vision to a professional coder who might not understand the industry for which they\u2019re building the tool.\n\nIncreased efficiency\n\nBy automating mundane, monotonous, or redundant tasks, businesses are able to reduce the time their employees spend on those tasks, increasing work output and decreasing human error. This reduces wasted time on revisions and corrections, allowing employees to focus their attention on the items that require human interaction.\n\nBusiness agility and scalability\n\nNo-code automation allows companies to expand their offerings and business scale without traditional constraints. The automation of many tasks allows businesses to scale up and down as needed with the drag-and-drop capabilities. These changes are easily and quickly implemented in no-code platforms.\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhat is the best codeless automation?\n\nThe best codeless automation depends on your specific needs. If you want to develop an app, you will likely choose different software than if your goal is to automate data tracking or build website surveys. It\u2019s important to speak with all project stakeholders in order to determine which platforms will best help you reach your audience or maintain your workflow.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of codeless automation?\n\nBecause the components are pre-built, the user can only do so much to make their creation truly specific or bespoke to fit their needs. However, while the creations that come from no-code platforms are technically limited, the existing databases for pre-built components are so vast that finding a tool to suit your needs well enough without coding is highly likely.\n\nCan project management be automated?\n\nYes, project management can be automated. While project management can\u2019t be completely automatic, it can be automated in several manually redundant areas to reduce the time project managers are spending on minor tasks. With no-code software, you can automate sending reminders, delegating tasks to level out workload, emailing updates on progress, and more."

        "article_content": "Surfshark VPN MSRP $15.45 Score Details \u201cSurfshark is a fast streaming VPN that let me connect an unlimited number of devices, making it a great choice to protect privacy and unblock worldwide streaming for the whole family.\u201d Pros Quick, reliable server connections\n\nPlenty of fast servers worldwide\n\nEasy-to-use design\n\nFast, helpful live chat support\n\nSupports unlimited devices Cons No free version\n\nTwo-year plan reverts to annual upon renewal\n\nSurfshark might sound dangerous, but it\u2019s actually a VPN that protects your privacy, quarantines malware, and hides your location and online activity from intrusive trackers.\n\nAs one of the leading streaming VPNs, Surfshark is known to maintain fast speeds, but I wanted to find out just how fast it was and if there were any gaps in performance.\n\nIn my review, I also tested the antivirus protection included with a Surfshark One subscription, checked up on prices, and tested customer support.\n\nTiers and pricing (free, trial, subs)\n\nSurfshark is one of only a few VPNs that support an unlimited number of devices, adding extra value if you share the account with family members and close friends.\n\nYou can try Surfshark free for seven days before paying and the 30-day money-back guarantee gives you even more time to decide whether it\u2019s worth the subscription cost.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a completely free solution, check out our guide to the best free VPNs that protect your privacy with a few restrictions.\n\nSurfshark Starter costs $15.45 monthly, but the savings start when you subscribe for one or two years. The annual plan costs $45 and includes three free months. It renews at $60 per year, which is about average for a good VPN.\n\nThe two-year plan at $59 is a great bargain, plus you get three months for free. After 27 months, the renewal reverts to an annual plan at $60. Still, that beats the price of some top competitors. For example, NordVPN is an excellent VPN, but the subscription cost more than doubles when you renew.\n\nSurfshark also offers cybersecurity bundles. Surfshark One includes malware protection for less than a dollar more each month. Surfshark One+ costs $2 to $3 more monthly and protects your privacy with ongoing requests to remove your personal information from data brokers.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a better VPN deal, there are usually sales and promotions that can help you save more. Just make sure you keep an eye on renewal dates so you aren\u2019t caught off guard when prices go up.\n\nDesign\n\nI tested Surfshark One, which I thought sounded like the sweet spot. Installation was quick, with helpful tips to install the apps and browser extensions.\n\nThe Windows app is well-designed, with a panel on the right showing at-a-glance confirmation of whether or not the VPN is enabled, which features are on, and which server I\u2019m connected to.\n\nOn the left, I get a list of worldwide servers with quick links to recommended, recently used, and favorites at the top of the list. I can also search for a location and filter the list to see only static IP addresses or multi-hop servers.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to use the basics without understanding advanced features, yet fine-tuning is a click away whenever you want.\n\nA toolbar on the far left lets me change settings for the VPN connection, access my account, get help, and explore features like antivirus protection and identity alerts.\n\nThe browser extension is convenient since that\u2019s where I\u2019m most likely to want to change VPN settings. However, the app has more settings.\n\nFeatures (reliability, speed, location hidden, cross-plat, special)\n\nBeyond protecting privacy, I want a VPN that is fast and reliable. To test Surfshark, I connected to several servers located around the world. The results were impressive.\n\nWith Surfshark\u2019s Windows app and browser extension, I enjoyed quick connections that never dropped and good speeds worldwide. My ISP delivers 900 Mbps download speeds over Ethernet. Most streaming VPNs cut that in half even when I select a nearby server.\n\nWith the nearest Surfshark VPN server, I measured 728 Mbpson the SpeedTest website, one of the fastest I\u2019ve ever recorded for a VPN. Upload speed was 38 Mbps and ping was around 44 ms both ways. I\u2019m in Nova Scotia, Canada, on the East Coast and the closest Surfshark server was in Montreal, over 700 miles away.\n\nGreat speed within the country is nice, but I often use a VPN to browse worldwide like I was a local, so the real challenge is maintaining good bandwidth across the border.\n\nSurfshark continued to deliver blistering speed with 667 Mbps down, 17 Mbps up, and a 75 ms ping with a U.S. server. Upload speeds and ping always drops overseas, and that was true for Surfshark, but downloads were very fast with 579 Mbps for the U.K., 651 Mbps for France, and 630 Mbps for Germany.\n\nThe first significant drop showed up with an Australian server that managed 306 Mbps downloads. The 5 Mbps uploads and 100+ ms ping of European servers fell to 2Mbps uploads and 244 ms ping Down Under.\n\nOverall, Surfshark outpaced speedy VPNs like ExpressVPN and the fast and cheap TorGuard. While Surfshark was consistently fast, the other two performed well with nearby servers, but fell behind when connecting to more distant locations.\n\nSurfshark One includes a virus scanner and real-time protection for up to five devices. Surfshark\u2019s antivirus earned a perfect score in a June 2024 evaluation by independent cybersecurity lab AV-Test.\n\nIn my spot-check of Surfshark One\u2019s CleanWeb feature, it didn\u2019t block any of Wicar\u2019s malware tests. That\u2019s because Surfshark\u2019s blocking is reputation-based. That means it won\u2019t block and alert you to dangerous websites or downloads unless they are in its database.\n\nAfter downloading the EICAR malware test file, I ran Surfshark One\u2019s antivirus scanner and it quickly identified and quarantined the threat. Although Wicar.org is safe, more advanced antivirus software detects browser exploits and malicious files, preventing the potential threat before it\u2019s downloaded to your computer.\n\nSupport\n\nSome VPN providers have good, but slow support since answers come via email. Surfshark has 24/7 live chat support so you can get help all day, every day.\n\nI tested it by asking about CleanWeb, Surfshark One\u2019s blocking feature. An AI chatbot was helpful, offering several buttons to narrow down my questions and pointing me to relevant support documents.\n\nWhen I stumped the bot, I asked for a human and was immediately transferred. I learned that the Surfshark browser extension is for convenience, but you get the same VPN and antivirus protection from the app.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nSurfshark makes its privacy policy easy to understand by getting to the most important details first: minimal data is collected, only what\u2019s needed to provide the service you\u2019re paying for. Surfshark requires your user ID or IP address and time stamp while browsing, but deletes that data within 15 minutes of your session ending.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any record of Surfshark security breaches, and the privacy policy checks out. While Surfshark is located in a Nine Eyes country, it\u2019s audited no-log policy indicates the company won\u2019t have any data to share even if there are official requests.\n\nSurfshark doesn\u2019t sell or share your email to third-party advertisers.\n\nIs Surfshark right for you?\n\nSurfshark has a well-designed app, great customer service, and one of the fastest streaming VPNs with plenty of servers around the globe. The unlimited device support makes it hard to go wrong with this service, particularly if you subscribe for one to two years.\n\nFor less than a dollar extra each month, Surfshark One includes a good malware scanner and dark web monitoring. That\u2019s a tempting offer, but it offers limited browser protection. You\u2019ll want to keep your dedicated antivirus software active to block viruses. Surfshark Starter is the best pick for most people.\n\nI was impressed with Surfshark\u2019s speed, reliability, and depth of features. The quick support makes it easy to get help or learn more about how to use Surfshark\u2019s apps and extensions.\n\nI recommend Surfshark as one of the best VPNs with excellent speed, good privacy protection, easy operation, and great value."

        "date": "Motor Trend20h",
        "source": "Motor Trend",
        "article_content": "We\u2019re Just weeks out from Tesla\u2019s big RoboTaxi presentation where the automaker's self-driving shuttle will be revealed, and third-party independent research firm AMCI Testing has some bad news that could hang over the event like a cloud. AMCI just completed what it claims is \u201cthe most extensive real world test\u201d of Tesla\u2019s Full Self Driving (FSD) software, ostensibly the technology that would underpin the RoboTaxi's driverless tech, and the results are not confidence inspiring.\n\nAMCI says its test covered over 1,000 miles of use and, in short, showed that the performance of Tesla\u2019s FSD software is \u201csuspect.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Tesla has caught criticism for FSD. For years, Tesla FSD software has been a source of controversy for the automaker. Tesla has dealt with everything from being called out by the California DMV for false advertising to being investigated by NHTSA.\n\nThere has been so many incidents involving Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and FSD that we had to build a megathread to keep track of them all. It's worth noting that Tesla claims FSD is still in \"beta,\" so it's incomplete, but it also sells the feature as a five-figure option on its current lineup of EVs, allowing owners to opt into being, essentially, real-world test dummies for the system. They must acknowledge that the system requires driver oversight and is not, as its name implies, a fully self-driving system today. Still, Tesla is essentially offloading the kind of testing other automakers conduct scientifically, with engineers and oversight, to customers in the real world. And AMCI\u2019s findings on how reliable FSD is\u2014or rather, is not\u2014are just the latest road bump for Tesla and FSD.\n\nAMCI says it conducted its tests in a Tesla Model 3 with FSD versions 12.5.1 and 12.5.3 across four different driving environments: city streets, rural two-lane highways, mountain roads, and freeways. AMCI was impressed with FSD\u2019s ability to rely solely on cameras. (Tesla is the only automaker whose driver assistance systems of FSD's ambition operate using only cameras and, essentially, short-distance parking sensors, rather than a more complex\u2014and expensive\u2014combination of cameras, sensors, radar, and lidar, which can paint a much clearer picture with more redundancies than Tesla's camera array.) However, AMCI found that, on average, when operating FSD, human intervention is required at least once every 13 miles to maintain safe operation.\n\n\u201cWith all hands-free augmented driving systems, and even more so with driverless autonomous vehicles, there is a compact of trust between the technology and the public. When this technology is offered the public is largely unaware of the caveats (such as monitor or supervise) and the tech considered empirically foolproof. Getting close to foolproof, yet falling short, creates an insidious and unsafe operator complacency issue as proven in the test results,\u201d said David Stokols, CEO of AMCI Testing\u2019s parent company, AMCI Global. \u201cAlthough it positively impresses in some circumstances, you simply cannot reliably rely on the accuracy or reasoning behind its responses.\u201d\n\nYou can see the full results of the test for yourself, but here is the gist from AMCI:\n\nMore than 1,000 miles driven\n\nCity streets, two-lane highways, mountain roads, and freeways\n\nDay and night operation; backlit to full-frontal sun\n\n2024 Model 3 Performance with Hardware 4\n\nFull Self Driving (Supervised) Profile Setting: Assertive\n\nSurprisingly capable, while simultaneously problematic (and occasionally dangerously inept)\n\nThe confidence (and often, competence) with which it undertakes complex driving tasks lulls users into believing that it is a thinking machine\u2014with its decisions and performance based on a sophisticated assessment of risk (and the user\u2019s wellbeing)\n\nIf you think 13-miles intervals between instances where a driver must grab the wheel or tap the brakes is pretty good, it's not just the number of interventions required, but the way those situations unfold. AMCI\u2019s final point is the most eyebrow-raising (emphasis theirs): \u201cWhen errors occur, they are occasionally sudden, dramatic, and dangerous; in those circumstances, it is unlikely that a driver without their hands on the wheel will be able to intervene in time to prevent an accident\u2014or possibly a fatality.\u201d\n\nTo back up its report, AMCI released three videos showing some of the instances in which FSD performed unsafely. Tesla has yet to publicly respond to this report, though we wouldn\u2019t hold our breath for that. Again, the automaker can fall back on the idea that the software is still in development. Common sense, however, suggests that putting a feature with the FSD name and purported future self-driving capabilities into the hands of regular people now\u2014when decisions the system makes or can flub\u2014have dire consequences, and AMCI's testing proves that FSD's shortcomings rear their heads quite often."
