That's not an issue.\n\n\"It's going to be which president is most likely to step forward and confirm the ET presence.\"\n\nAfter the bill is passed, the pressure from the public will be so great that a sitting president would have no choice but to allow disclosure, Bassett claimed.\n\nHe said: \"The sooner they get in front of the people the better.\n\n\"We're one play away from ending this truth embargo 77 years after the press release in Roswell announcing that the Army Air Force had a crashed flying saucer.\n\n\"Those who are frustrated and leave the field right now are not going to get to join us in the in the locker room, but that's how close we are.\"\n\nThe sooner they get in front of the people the better\n\nAnother way disclosure of alien life could come would be if a Senate hearing with experts testifying came during the lame duck period.\n\nInstead of waiting for a new president and Congress, the current one would step forward in November or December and reveal the information, Bassett said.\n\nHe added: \"That hearing which I've described in countless interviews that I've given, it'll be one of the most important hearings in history, watched by millions.\n\n\"That sets the stage for President Biden to come forward and be the disclosure President by confirming what this hearing is just demonstrated.\n\n\"In which case Joe Biden would be the disclosure president.\n\n\"It would be an extraordinary legacy for him, and he would go out the door at the peak of his service to the country.\"\n\n11 Former DoD UFO worker David Grusch testifies before a House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing about UFOs Credit: EPA\n\n11 Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray plays a video of a UFO Credit: EPA\n\n11 Trump revealed aliens isn't 'his thing' in an interview with Joe Rogan Credit: Joe Rogan Experience\n\n11 Bassett said Joe Biden may also choose to release information during his lame duck period Credit: The Mega Agency\n\nTrump has spoken about aliens during the election campaign telling popular American podcaster Lex Fridman that he would \"surely\" make secret footage of alleged UFO sightings public.\n\nDuring the chat, Fridman asked Trump: \"Will you help push the Pentagon to release more footage, which a lot of people claim is available?\"\n\nTo which Trump readily agreed and said: \"Oh yeah, sure, I'll do that. I would do that. I'd love to do that. I have to do that.\"\n\nTrump also spoke about \"people coming from space\" with Joe Rogan in their three-hour interview.\n\nWhen Rogan asked Trump if he thought aliens were \"flying around\" he said there was \"no reason not to\".\n\nTrump said: \"There's no reason to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life.\"\n\nWhen Rogan suggested that some of the more recent sightings could have been advanced drones, Trump repeatedly says: \"could be\".\n\nTrump said: \"I interviewed a few people, it's never been my thing to be honest, I have never been a believer.\n\n\"It's not a great interest for me, but it's still of a little interest.\n\n\"I interviewed jet pilots that were solid people, perfect, great pilot great everything, they said: 'We saw things, sir, that were very strange'.\"\n\nTrump has previously commented on UFOs while in office when the Pentagon released three infrared videos of flying objects in 2020.\n\nHe said: \"I just wonder if it\u2019s real... that\u2019s a hell of a video.\"\n\nIn 2019, he told George Stephanopoulos that \"we\u2019re watching\" for aliens, \"and you\u2019ll be the first to know.\"\n\nThe Trump and Harris campaigns have been contacted for comment.\n\n11 Mexican journalist and UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan claims this specimen is not related to any known Earthly species Credit: Getty\n\n11 Steve Bassett is the only registered UFO lobbyist in Washington DC Credit: STEVE BASSETT"

        "article_content": "King Charles is known as a man of discerning tastes and strong opinions. He has a long-held interest in alternative beliefs and mystical therapies, and we all know his thoughts on leaky pens.\n\nBut who would have thought His Majesty may also have been a close associate of visitors from another planet and was once spotted at the controls of a UFO?\n\nThat is the bizarre claim being made in a new TV documentary which examines the royals' interest in UFOs and other paranormal mysteries.\n\nKing Of UFOs, made by British musician and UFO buff Mark Christopher Lee and now available on Amazon Prime, asks the question: does the Royal Family know what's really out there?\n\nIn it, he speaks to a diver, Dan Costello, who says he witnessed Charles, then Prince of Wales, at the controls of 'a saucer-shaped craft with dual rotor blades' at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1975.\n\nKing Charles may have been a close associate of visitors from another planet and was once spotted at the controls of a UFO\n\nThe then dashing 27-year-old prince was one of three pilots spotted steering the 'odd-looking' object, while serving as a qualified helicopter pilot with the Royal Navy, he claims.\n\nDescribing the aircraft, he says: 'It would sit and hover in the sky with the blades not on [rotating] with no sound of propulsion, just a faint crackle of electromagnetism.'\n\nWhile, sadly, Costello goes on to admit that the aircraft Charles was allegedly flying was most probably not of alien origin, but part of a secret military operation, involving the British and Canadian governments \u2013 plus it hasn't been confirmed that Charles was anywhere near Canada at the time \u2013 it does bring into focus a royal fascination with all things 'other worldly', that goes back generations.\n\nIndeed, as I can exclusively reveal, the King may well have inherited a keen interest in the subject from his late father, Prince Philip, and his great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, both of whom were avid enthusiasts.\n\nPhilip had a lifelong interest and curiosity in a range of fringe subjects, including UFOs, crop circles and the Loch Ness monster.\n\nMountbatten's fascination, meanwhile, reached its zenith between 1950 and 1959, shortly before his appointment as Chief of Defence Staff, the highest position in the British military. And it prompts Lee, in the documentary, to ask of our new King: 'Does he know the truth? If so, he should release this truth to the public.'\n\nAs an investigative journalist, university lecturer and committed ufologist, I first heard of the active role the royals had played in seeking the answer to the ultimate question \u2013 Are we alone? \u2013 as part of my research back in the early 2000s.\n\nI was able to examine Mountbatten's private papers at the Broadlands Archive, which prove he had a thing for space travel and avidly consumed the early literature on flying saucers, as UFOs were known at that time.\n\nPrince Charles, then Prince of Wales, was seen at the controls of 'a saucer-shaped craft with dual rotor blades' at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1975\n\nLord Mountbatten and his nephew Prince Philip at the Royal Marines barracks in October 1965\n\nThe term 'flying saucer' was first used in 1947 after pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing a chain of nine objects in the sky while flying over Washington State, describing them as flying at great speed and skipping like a 'saucer on water'.\n\nThe world was gripped and, before long, saucers were being spotted everywhere.\n\nIn 1950, Mountbatten encouraged newspaper editor Charles Eade, who had served as his press secretary during the war in the Far East, to publish 'all the available evidence' in his paper, the Sunday Dispatch.\n\nEade wanted Mountbatten to allow his name to be used in his series as it would add to its credibility \u2013 but Mountbatten refused.\n\nInstead, Eade's front-page splash, under the headline 'Flying saucers... the story that may be bigger than atom bomb wars', was credited to a source whom he described as 'one of the most famous men alive today' who 'commands universal respect and admiration'.\n\nMountbatten's theory was that they were craft from other planets, as his letters to Eade reveal: 'The available evidence shows they are not of human agency, that is to say they do not come from our Earth.\n\n'If that is so, then presumably they must come from some heavenly body, probably a planet. Maybe it is the Shackletons and Scotts of Venus or Mars who are making their first exploration of our Earth.' This interest was shared by Charles and by Prince Philip, who was among the first subscribers to the magazine Flying Saucer Review, launched in London during 1955 and edited by retired RAF pilot Derek Dempster.\n\nAccording to one of its later editors, Gordon Creighton, every copy was sent to Buckingham Palace.\n\nIn 2002 I was invited to tea by Mountbatten's youngest daughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, now 95, at her stately home in Oxfordshire to discuss the subject.\n\nShe told me how her father was fond of asking, 'Do you believe in flying saucers?' as a conversation opener during visits to royal courts and capitals across Europe.\n\nShe described a lunch with the then King Idris of Libya, when her father was Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Mediterranean. 'After the usual pleasantries there was quite a long silence and my father decided to break it by asking [through an interpreter] what for him was the burning question, 'Will you ask his majesty if he believes in flying saucers?'\n\n'There was this frightful pause, as the king thought his leg was being pulled. But when it was established that it was a genuine question, he said that of course he believed in them.\n\n'He said he had seen two of them himself and added that the Prophet recorded how a close companion of his had seen one of the fiery sphere types \u2013 as had his camel.'\n\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Edinburgh's voracious appetite for information on flying saucers was confirmed to me by RAF Air Marshal Sir Peter Horsley, who served as his equerry from 1952 to 1955.\n\nLord Mountbatten with Prince Philip and Charles at a polo match in 1977\n\nWhen I spoke to him in 2001, the year he died, he revealed he'd been tasked by his employer with finding out as much as he could on the subject and was given carte blanche to read any reports and to interview fighter pilots who had reported seeing unusual phenomena in the sky.\n\nHe told me he had arranged, with the duke's personal approval, for RAF Fighter Command to send copies of the latest sightings made by aircrew for examination at Buckingham Palace.\n\nPerhaps the strangest outcome of this inquiry was Peter Horsley's role in inviting several UFO witnesses to discuss their experiences at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThese included the captain of a BOAC airliner, James Howard, who witnessed, along with other crew members and passengers, a strange formation of UFOs while flying over the North Atlantic in June 1954.\n\nAnother visitor to the palace was schoolboy Stephen Darbishire who obtained two photographs of a 'saucer' hovering above the slopes of the Old Man of Coniston in the Lake District, in February of that year.\n\nHorsley explained his reason for inviting UFO witnesses to the palace was partly to 'put them on the spot' and to test their honesty in the presence of royalty \u2013 a method as effective as any truth serum.\n\nThey both passed the test with flying colours, convincing their esteemed hosts \u2013 and Horsley himself \u2013 that Earth had indeed had visitations from outer space.\n\nHorsley was scathing about a growing movement of cranks and fantasists, however, who he thought were making a mockery \u2013 and quite a bit of money \u2013 out of the flying saucer craze.\n\nAmong those Horsley accused of making a joke out of a very serious subject was the notorious Polish-American writer George Adamski, who co-authored the 1953 best-seller Flying Saucers Have Landed with Desmond Leslie, a former Second World War Spitfire pilot who had his own contacts in the British establishment.\n\nLeslie was friends with General Sir Frederick 'Boy' Browning, the husband of author Daphne du Maurier. After retiring from the military, Browning had become head of Princess Elizabeth's staff and, following her accession, worked for Prince Philip.\n\nBrowning was another member of what Horsley described as 'the flying saucer club' at the palace.\n\nAdamski's book contained his personal account of an alleged meeting with the Venusian pilot of a flying saucer 'scout-ship' that landed in the Mojave Desert of California, communicating with its angelic occupant by telepathy.\n\nIn April 1959, Adamski embarked on a European lecture tour that included an audience with the Dutch royal family \u2013 proving they too had caught the alien bug \u2013 and, shortly before he arrived in London, Leslie wrote to the Duke of Edinburgh, enclosing a personal invitation for them to meet Adamski, in secret if necessary.\n\nPrince Philip clearly realised the public relations danger this could place him in as he annotated Leslie's letter \u2013 now preserved in the Imperial War Museum archives \u2013 with the words, 'Not on your Nellie!', adding in a later note: 'He may not be a crank but he's a bit too fanciful for me!'\n\nHowever, despite the royal disapproval, both General Browning and Peter Horsley met Leslie and Adamski during their visit at a private address in London.\n\nHorsley told me he was not impressed by either. He felt that Desmond Leslie was 'probably sincere but gullible, sucked into the saucer cult by people who hoped to profit from it, such as Adamski' and he warned Browning against having any further contact with them.\n\nPeter Horsley's direct knowledge of the duke's interest in UFOs and other strange phenomena ended when he left the palace in 1955 to return to RAF duties. Yet the royal fascination remained.\n\nIn 1978, Lord Mountbatten joined Prince Philip and the Queen at the star-spangled royal premiere of Steven Spielberg's Hollywood blockbuster Close Encounters of the Third Kind at the Odeon in Leicester Square. The film tells the story of government conspiracy to hide the first arrival of UFOs and their friendly alien crews on Earth.\n\nOver the decades the duke had maintained an active interest in a range of esoteric subjects.\n\nDuring the 1960s, he became involved in plans for a full-scale investigation in search of the Loch Ness monster.\n\nA Conservative MP, David James, persuaded him to use his connections with the Royal Navy to push for a publicly funded expedition to Loch Ness. The MoD's Chief of Defence Staff, Sir Solly Zuckerman, raised the idea with the navy's Chief Scientist, Sir John Caroll, arguing that 'if a sonar investigation were to reveal something extraordinary in the loch, it would be of considerable scientific interest'. But Caroll blocked the idea, saying it would be too costly.\n\nRoyal interest in the arcane also extended to the crop circle phenomenon which, some argue, are created by extra-terrestrial life. One of the leading promoters of the mystery, Colin Andrews, sent a copy of his book Circular Evidence, co-written with Pat Delgado, to Queen Elizabeth.\n\nIn August of that year, The Times revealed that the book had been added to the Royal Family's 'holiday reading list'. Shortly afterwards, Andrews received a note from Buckingham Palace asking if he would provide updates 'on the latest developments on the Circles Phenomenon' for the Duke of Edinburgh, who had become a paid subscriber to his Crop Circles newsletter.\n\nBut the royals turned down Andrews' offer to provide a personal briefing on the subject, perhaps having learned lessons from the duke's earlier flirtation with George Adamski and his friends.\n\nNo one has been able to establish the full extent of the Duke of Edinburgh's personal interest in UFOs and other strange phenomena as he never mentioned the subject in media interviews.\n\nHowever, several contributors to the documentary, King Of UFOs, say that the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle include sealed files that are not to be opened until 90 years after his death \u2013 so more may yet be revealed.\n\nIn 2017, I wrote to Prince Philip to ask if correspondence on UFOs and crop circles had been preserved. I said there was considerable public interest in its contents, in particular the private study of the subject, completed on his behalf by Peter Horsley in 1955.\n\nAfter a lengthy delay, Prince Philip's private secretary, Brigadier Archie Miller-Bakewell, responded: 'I am afraid that extensive searches have not yielded any papers that would be of help to your research. This letter comes with His Royal Highness's best wishes.'\n\nIf he did know the truth, the duke \u2013 private, discreet and careful to the end \u2013 took it with him. But what about King Charles?"

        "article_content": "Fears of an alien invasion in the US took hold in the 1960s and 70s after reports of UFOs hovering over military bases flooded the nation.\n\nNow, decades later, a UFO expert has claimed that the extraterrestrial spaceships did visit 'every major nuclear missile base' and continue to do so to this day.\n\nRobert Hastings, who has interviewed many Army personnel about the bizarre sightings, said: 'The ones that are currently operational, have been visited repeatedly year after year according to the sources that I have interviewed.'\n\nHastings recently made waves when he revealed more than 120 former service members had come forward about their encounters with flying objects near nuclear weapon storage and testing grounds.\n\n'A public, grassroots effort must be made in the interim to understand \u2013 as best as possible, using the data gathered thus far \u2013 the nature and intentions of those who pilot the UFOs,' Hastings penned in his recent book recounting the interviews.\n\n'Or perhaps they have a use for our planet, let's say for scientific purposes, and know that global nuclear warfare will disrupt their data-gathering and/or experiments.'\n\nIn his book, UFOs and Nukes, he revealed that investigators are prevented from properly probing the cases because of dubious layers of classification.\n\nOne thing is for sure, however, it is 'obvious' that if there are extraterrestrial visitors, they are 'greatly interested in our nuclear weapons.'\n\nA UFO expert claimed that UFOs have long visited nuclear bases and continue to do so. For at least 17 nights in December 2023, swarms of small 'drones' were seen penetrating the highly restricted airspace above Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.\n\nHastings' comments echo a study released in June that analyzed over 500 of the best-supported UFO cases from the heights of the Cold War, which concluded that 'this intelligence understands atomics, and they understand atomic weaponry.'\n\nUFO reports over America's nuclear arsenal appeared to shift from sites where the bombs were made to missile silos and US air bases as the Cold War arms race grew.\n\nThe study was conducted by a retired US Air Force staff sergeant, data analyst affiliated with Harvard's UFO-hunting Galileo Project Ian Porrit and a research team.\n\nThe group focused on official military and police reports of UFOs from 1945 to 1975, avoiding poorly supported accounts and ambiguous newspaper stories, to focus on cases with multiple witnesses and signal evidence, like radar.\n\nTheir study, which only covered US cases, also used reports of UFOs spotted above non-nuclear army bases and nearby civilian centers to act as control groups to test against their findings of any UFO trends at America's sensitive nuclear installations.\n\nThe team found that data from 1948 through 1975, showed support to the idea that extraterrestrials, or some other intelligence, has methodically surveilled America's rise to a nuclear power.\n\n'This intelligence understands the developmental cycle. They have some contextual knowledge of what they're looking at and what they're looking for,' Hancock told DailyMail.com, given these shifts in reported UFO sightings over time.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1952, as America's production of atomic weapons first ramped up, waves of UFO sightings began cropping up over Washington state's Hanford nuclear production complex, as well as Los Alamos and other sites for the Manhattan Project.\n\nHastings' recent claims come just weeks after new government records surfaced other UFO waves near military sites, including Joint Base Langley-Eustis (pictured)\n\n'What we know now is that inside the Air Force for the first seven to 10 years they sincerely believed it was the Russians,' Hancock told DailyMail.com.\n\n'And when they couldn't prove that,' he said, 'it became very political.'\n\nFrom 1952 onward, their study found cases of UFOs probing near active nuclear weapons took precedence, with a wave of sightings around America's new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) starting in the 1960s.\n\n'When you get to those ICBM bases, from about 1965 to 1975, these things are occurring at night,' Hancock pointed out.\n\n'And they are they are much more intrusive. They're very low altitude, they penetrate the security perimeters of the base,' he added.\n\nHastings' recent claims come just weeks after new government records surfaced other UFO waves near military sites, including 17 nights in December 2023 when swarms of UFOs were tracked over Joint Base Langley-Eustis.\n\nThese brazen penetrations over Langley \u2014 home to at least half the Air Force's F-22 Raptor stealth fighters \u2014 led to two weeks of emergency White House meetings.\n\nTo date, Langley's mystery UFOs have eluded identification by the Pentagon, police and even NASA's high-altitude research plane, the WB-57F, called in to investigate.\n\nGeneral Glen VanHerck, the commander with North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD), who led the mission to take down the infamous Chinese spy balloon in February 2023, described that Langley wave as unlike any other known case.\n\n'If there are unknown objects within North America,' General VanHerck told the Wall Street Journal, 'go out and identify them.'\n\nSenior ex-Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com last week that the UFOs were 'swarms of smaller craft' released by 'motherships.'\n\nHe explained that was 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\nMellon told DailyMail.com: 'I make no claims regarding their origin, perhaps many are Chinese drones.'\n\n'[But] in some instances,' Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'"

        "article_content": "Sleep is really important. Plenty of us don\u2019t do what it takes to get enough sleep \u2014 not to mention the fact that a large portion of people have sleep disorders that they don\u2019t even know about. We\u2019ve had sleep trackers and sleep-tracking tech to help us get a better understanding of our sleep for some time now, but AI could help supercharge the tech.\n\nIn fact, there are already plenty of AI-powered sleep apps already available. Curious about whether or not AI might be able to help you sleep? Here are some of the best AI-powered sleep apps.\n\nSEE ALSO: Apple Watch Series 10 introduces a new sleep apnea feature\n\nSleeptracker-AI\n\nSleeptracker has long been a favorite for tracking sleep and gaining a better understanding of it, but in recent years, the company has been leveraging AI tech to improve on what the app can offer. Sleeptracker is used in conjunction with a hardware tracker, which is placed under your mattress, and can track sleep of two people, with sensors on each side of the bed. The AI part of the app comes from the fact that Sleeptracker has trained its algorithms on data from over 1 million smart devices, combined with over 70 research studies, and vetted by Stanford Sleep Medicine and UCSF. The underlying tech was developed by Fullpower-AI, and it\u2019s considered one of the more accurate sleep-tracking systems out there.\n\nSleepScore\n\nSleepScore, by SleepScore Labs, is another much-loved sleep-tracking system, and another of the most accurate ones. SleepScore was developed by ResMed, and it uses the microphones and speakers on your phone to analyze your movements and your breathing patterns. SleepScore Labs also has another app, called \u201cDo I Snore or Grind,\u201d and it uses the same tech to detect how regularly you snore or grind your teeth.\n\nNightly\n\nNightly leverages AI a little more than some of the competition. Nightly tracks your sleep, to be sure, but it also plays AI-generated sounds designed to help you sleep better, and based on your environment, how your day went (based on your input), and more. It has various white noise sounds and beats that Nightly says will help users get deeper sleep, and more.\n\nSleep Cycle\n\nSleep Cycle is built around tracking your sleep with AI-powered algorithms, and actually using that information to help you feel better when you wake up. When you set an alarm in the app, it\u2019ll use your sleep cycle information to wake you up at the point of your lightest sleep, helping ensure that you start your day feeling great. It also uses ambient sounds to detect your sleep, so you don\u2019t need to wear anything or use other devices, if you don\u2019t want to.\n\nPillow\n\nPillow is designed to take some of the guesswork out of sleep-tracking. It leverages AI to process a massive range of data points around your sleep, and if you use it with an Apple Watch, you don\u2019t need to do anything to start tracking \u2014 it\u2019ll automatically track your sleep when it thinks you\u2019re sleeping. It\u2019ll even record audio when it detects you snoring, and use machine learning to give you a detailed sleep analysis after each night."

        "article_content": "It\u2019s important to have a home with a look you love. The difference between coming home to a poorly organized setup, versus one that looks intentional and put together, can be huge. But not everyone can afford to spend cash on an interior designer.\n\nThankfully, with AI, you don\u2019t have to spend that money. There are tons of great AI interior design apps to help you get the most out of your home, both when it comes to shopping for furniture and other items to round out your living space, and when it comes to maximizing the space with the items you already have.\n\nSEE ALSO: IKEA's new furniture line attempts to take gamers out of the basement\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the best AI interior design apps:\n\nHomestyler\n\nHomestyler is one of the most-loved AI interior design apps, not only leveraging AI tech, but also augmented reality (AR), to help you visualize a design in your actual space. You can upload images of your space to place furniture, decorations, and more in, and you can choose from a variety of styles, including Glam, Contemporary, Bohemian, and more.\n\nSpecific to AI is the fact that you can have the built-in AI Designer generate ideas of its own using your uploaded images, and based on your filters around style. You can even upload floor plans, and switch from interior designer to exterior design, so you can design every aspect of your home.\n\nRoom Planner\n\nRoom Planner is a little more minimalistic than some of the others, but that also means it\u2019s a little easier to use, and takes less time to get to actual ideas. You can have the app maintain your room\u2019s color-scheme, ensuring that you won\u2019t have to start from scratch when it comes to decorations and furniture. It\u2019s also free, and lets you generate as many images as you want. The service is in beta, so it might generate some weird ideas from time to time, but because it\u2019s free, it\u2019s hard to have a big issue with that.\n\nDreamhouse AI\n\nDreamhouse AI is one of the more powerful options on this list, and while it\u2019s not free, it is considered to offer some of the best designs. The service has a very user-friendly interface, and makes it easy to get up and running quickly, with high-quality designs and inspirations you can use to create your space.\n\nThe service has a monthly and yearly plan, and if you\u2019re moving into a new home, it\u2019s worth signing up for a month to get ideas for all the rooms in your new home \u2014 after which you can simply unsubscribe.\n\nREimagineHome\n\nPerhaps you\u2019d prefer to use a web-based app than one on your phone, in which case REimagineHome is the way to go. This service also lets you upload images of your space, and allows you to stage bare rooms, or redesign rooms that are already furnished.\n\nCoohom\n\nMost of the AI interior design apps so far can generate great ideas and inspirations, but what if you want ideas using furniture you already have? Coohom has a huge library of furniture that you can match to what you own, or at least find something pretty close \u2014 so you don\u2019t have to try and imagine what your furniture will look like in a space. You can even import 3D renders from other sources. The software is a little more advanced than others, and there\u2019s a bit of a learning curve \u2014 but if you\u2019re willing to spend some time learning how to use the software, you might get more personalized results."

It also makes Photomator, a photo editing app.\n\nApple has highlighted Pixelmator apps over the years in its keynote product launches.

Here\u2019s everything new in ChromeOS 130.\n\nWhat\u2019s New in ChromeOS 130?\n\nThe first major addition is the new Recorder app, which is rolling out to all Chromebooks. It looks quite similar to the one you find on Pixels with Material You theming and on-device transcription. On Chromebook Plus, you also get title suggestions and three-point summaries. The app seems to be rolling out to Chromebook Plus first, as we couldn\u2019t find it on our non-Plus unit.\n\nQuick Insert is another great feature rolling out in ChromeOS 130. The Galaxy Chromebook Plus is the first Chromebook to get a dedicated Quick Insert key. With this, you can now use a keyboard shortcut Launcher + F to emulate the same key on other Chromebooks.\n\nSimilarly, Focus Mode turns on DND and integrates Google Tasks in the UI, allowing you to work efficiently and be more productive without distractions. I\u2019ve tried the new Focus Mode, and it has how it helped me get things done quickly. So, I\u2019m sure you all will like it too.\n\nWelcome Recap is also rolling out in ChromeOS 130, and it shows you the files and apps you were working on before you last shut down your Chromebook. You can restore all the apps in a jiffy, and it can also serve as a reminder if you usually forget what you were working on last night.\n\nBesides, there\u2019s now support for multiple calendars, and an option to adjust keyboard backlight brightness in Settings. There\u2019s a similar slider in display settings with Ambient brightness control, but we couldn\u2019t find it on our Chromebook.\n\nImage Credit: Google\n\nAs for the Chromebook Plus-specific new AI features, there are two new features \u2014 Studio-style mic and Help me Read. The Studio-style mic feature is pretty straightforward. It uses AI to enhance the input sound quality and processes it to give it a studio feel.\n\nImage Credit: Google\n\nThe Help me read feature, on the other hand, also uses AI to summarize websites and PDFs. Users will see a text field where they can ask questions about the documents or pages and get summaries for the same.\n\nThat\u2019s not it. There are some other notable additions that Google has shared in its Chromebook support thread like the ability to access Google Drive files from the shelf, privacy controls that are more accessible in Chrome, and suggestions in Tote.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on ChromeOS 130? Let us know in the comments below."

Paranormal Investigator, Nina Carrillo, says activity is often detected using a flash light. During investigations she sets it in an area away from her, and asks questions promoting a response. Often times activity will reply by turning on the light, without anyone touching it.\n\nInvestigators also works with local community members and businesses to address their concerns of paranormal activity. They travel to private residencies and conduct investigations, answering questions and help provide peace of mind.\n\nWhile Halloween wraps up the ghost walks for the season, the organization remains involved with the community by hosting fundraisers and monthly meetings.

        "article_content": "If you want to maximize your browsing potential or simply unblock your scraper tool, then you will need static residential proxies, also known as ISP proxies. These vital tools offer a combination of high data center-like performance and anonymity of residential proxies. They\u2019re perfect for activities like web scraping, SEO monitoring, and bypassing geo-restrictions.\n\nHowever, not all IPs are created equal so there are differences even among residential proxies. Thanks to the increased interest in these tools, quite a few companies are now offering these services. To help you make an informed decision, we curated a list of our top picks below, but first, let's look at factors that make up a good residential proxy offer.\n\nOur Top Picks for 2024\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you\u2019re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nBest Overall\n\n(Image credit: Bright Data)\n\n1. Bright Data (formerly Luminati) Best overall static residential proxies Our expert review: Specifications IP Pool: Over 72 million residential IPs Geotargeting: Supports precise location targeting Rotation: Option for static and rotating proxies Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Extensive global IP coverage + High reliability and uptime + Excellent customer support Reasons to avoid - Premium pricing\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a service provider with the largest IP pool on the market, then you cannot miss Bright Data. They are among the most popular proxy service providers in the market today, offering more products and solutions than most other competitors, from dedicated data center proxies to extraction tools. The response times usually hover around 1s with a 98.96% success rate, making them also one of the faster and more accurate providers in the field.\n\nWhile all of the above mentioned is a plus, if you\u2019re an individual or a small company just getting started in the world of proxies, then Bright Data\u2019s web dashboard may seem intimidating. What's more, the pricing is also on the premium side. The pay-as-you-go pricing model for residential proxies starts at $8.4/GB while the next pricing tier in the Growth plan starts at $499 a month. There is no free trial for their residential proxy offer, which also might be off-putting to new entrants in the field, but you do get top-notch security, great onboarding, and guaranteed uptime of 99.99% if you decide to pay for their services.\n\nRead our full Bright Data review.\n\nBest for Mid-Sized Businesses\n\n(Image credit: Smartproxy)\n\n2. Smartproxy Best for mid-sized businesses Our expert review: Specifications IP Pool: Over 40 million residential IPs Ease of Use: User-friendly dashboard Scalability: Suitable for small to medium-sized businesses Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Affordable and scalable plans + Intuitive user interface + Strong performance in scraping tasks Reasons to avoid - Limited advanced features for large enterprises\n\nSmartproxy boasts roughly 55 million IP address pools, a \u201ctad\u201d smaller compared to Bright Data, but still covering 190 countries (50 US states). Where it beats out its direct competitor is the response time which stands at roughly 0.5s and a 99.68% success rate. In terms of ease of use, there are Chrome and Firefox extensions for proxy management, complete with a proxy checker, where you can test out connections. The auto-rotation option is also useful if you need to change your IP frequently and would like to avoid the manual work behind it. Furthermore, Smartproxy boasts top-notch 24/7 support, extensive documentation, and great onboarding activities to ensure that mid-sized businesses and individual entrepreneurs can easily hit the ground running.\n\nPricing starts at the pay-as-you-go plan where you will be paying $7 per GB, but if you decide to commit to a higher plan, the next one, uninventively called the 2GB plan will charge you $6 per GB, but has a free trial offer if you\u2019re looking to test run services before committing.\n\nRead our full Smartproxy review.\n\nBest for enterprise-grade operations\n\n(Image credit: Oxylabs)\n\nAs one of the VIPs in the proxy world, Oxylabs is famous for its massive pool of proxies. These include more than 100 million ISP-assigned IPs in over 195 locations around the world (allowing you to zero in on a specific region, city, or even ISP), ensuring legitimacy and minimal risk of detection.\n\nThanks to their 5G/LTE connectivity, these proxies deliver super-fast speeds and low latency, even if you are handling hefty data loads. Plus, Oxylabs has built-in proxy rotation and session control, allowing you to manage long sessions without worrying about switching IPs.\n\nFurthermore, the platform gives you a steady, uninterrupted overview of geo-specific search results. Conducting market research? You can scrape data from websites without the fear of being banned. Its residential IPs, which mimic real users, also allow you to accurately check ad placements.\n\nAdditionally, Oxylabs provides customer support that is always there, day or night. And let\u2019s not forget about its easy-to-use API either, which facilitates quicker onboarding and makes large-scale data extraction run as smoothly as butter.\n\nIn terms of pricing, the company has flexible, customized plans based on how much you need, making it easy to scale whether you are a small startup or a big enterprise. The price tag matches the premium features and rock-solid reliability that come with it.\n\nFor instance, it offers a pay-as-you-go plan at $8 per 1GB with no limits on the number of concurrent sessions but limits the monthly traffic to 50GB. The base subscription option, Micro, will set you back by $99 per month ($7.75 per GB), imposing a 13GB limit.\n\nThat said, there are more powerful options for more demanding enterprises, like the Premium plan at $800 per month ($6.02 per GB), which includes 133GB of monthly traffic. Naturally, the more expensive plans lower these restrictions.\n\nSo, if your business needs fast, stable, wide-reaching, and scalable access to static residential IPs, Oxylabs is a go-to. It is especially handy if you need a ton of proxies for long-term projects, without having to worry about babysitting them all the time.\n\n\n\nRead our full Oxylabs review.\n\nBest for Versatile Geotargeting\n\n(Image credit: Soax)\n\n4. SOAX Best for versatile geotargeting Our expert review: Specifications IP Pool: Millions of residential IPs across 120+ countries Flexible Plans: Offers customizable packages Targeting Options: Country, region, and city-level targeting Today's Best Deals Visit Site Reasons to buy + Extensive targeting options + Flexible and affordable plans + Reliable for location-specific tasks Reasons to avoid - Limited support for large-scale scraping projects\n\nSOAX offers a proxy pool of over 2.6 million data center-hosted proxy servers, which seems small compared to the other more premium players in the field. However, the fact that these proxies can rotate with every connection and the option to create 24-hour sticky sessions, might find its use case among small businesses and individual entrepreneurs. The IPs cover over 190 worldwide locations, with US locations being their strong suit. Response times hover around 0.5s with a 99.55% success rate. Aside from proxies SOAX also offers scrapers, no-code AI scrapers, and web unblockers, but most of this is also offered by the premium providers.\n\nWhen it comes to pricing, SOAX represents a great price-to-offer ratio, as the initial plan Residential 15 costs $99 a month or $6.60 per GB, making it the cheapest offer on the list. Its offer is targeted at enterprise customers, however, smaller businesses can take advantage of the cheaper offer and still get a high-performing proxy with additional tools as a backup option.\n\nRead our full SOAX review.\n\nBest for Privacy and Security\n\n(Image credit: ProxyEmpire)\n\n5. ProxyEmpire Best for privacy and security Specifications IP Pool: Global residential IP coverage Privacy Focus: Strong encryption and anonymity features Support: 24/7 customer service Reasons to buy + High emphasis on privacy and security + Competitive pricing + Reliable for sensitive data tasks Reasons to avoid - Smaller IP pool compared to competitors\n\nAn epitaph that can be given to ProxyEmpire is certainly a small-scale residential proxy provider. While it does offer residential, mobile, and data center proxies, its pool of 9.5 million addresses across 170 countries is on the smaller side compared to the premium service providers. However, ProxyEmpire has an ace up its sleeve, called bandwidth rollover. Most residential proxy offerings (especially rotating ones) have a bandwidth expiration date of 30 days, regardless of whether you consume the bandwidth or not. Bandwidth rollover enables users to use their \u201cexpired bandwidth\u201d with the purchased one in the subsequent month. This is a great option for small proxy users who still haven\u2019t figured out their bandwidth needs.\n\nPrice-wise, it offers the cheapest solution on the market but only on the smallest plan and mid-tier plans. Namely, the Static Dedicated IP plan with 1 IP costs $2 per GB per month. However, to get competitive prices with more bandwidth you would have to move onto the higher tier plans like Hobby or Startup where you would pay $6 per GB or $5.45 per GB, respectively. There are a total of nine Static Residential IP pricing plans which means you will surely find one that suits your needs.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are static residential proxies?\n\nStatic residential proxies are IP addresses assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that remain constant over time. Unlike rotating proxies, these IPs are fixed, making them ideal for consistent tasks like managing multiple accounts or accessing geo-restricted content.\n\nHow to choose the best static residential proxies?\n\nConsider the size of the IP pool, geotargeting capabilities, pricing, and the level of customer support. Evaluate your specific needs, such as the scale of operations, to select the most appropriate service.\n\nHow to choose the right static residential proxies\n\nWhen selecting a static residential proxy provider, consider the following practical aspects:\n\nReputation: This one should be a no-brainer. Conducting online research on the reputation of the desired proxy provider, reading reviews, and ensuring that it has been around for some time can guarantee solid results.\n\nThis one should be a no-brainer.

There are flexible pricing options out there, but you should evaluate pricing on per IP basis and bandwidth availability. Compliance and privacy: Ensure the provider adheres to legal standards, such as GDPR or CCPA, and offers features that protect your anonymity and data privacy.\n\nAre static residential proxies legal?\n\nYes, but ensure that their use complies with the terms of service of the websites you're accessing and that they are used in accordance with data protection laws.\n\nConclusion\n\nEach provider has something unique to offer, from high-performance proxy servers for enterprise-level customers to individual entrepreneurs, at varying price points. In the end, the decision you make must be based on the needs of your business, with a recommendation from our side to test-run services that offer a free trial or a money-back guarantee. If you\u2019re a seasoned user and are in the market for the best services regardless of the price point, then sticking with one of the premium providers will ensure you\u2019ve covered all of your use cases. Leveraging proxies responsibly and ethically will surely give you a leg up on your competition thanks to access to valuable data as you maintain your privacy."

        "article_content": "The Golden State Warriors were the powerhouse of NBA basketball for the last decade. Since 2015, the Warriors have won four titles and made eight Finals appearances. In addition, the Warriors reframed modern basketball, led by Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. However, nothing lasts forever. The Warriors went 46-36 last season, did not advance past the Play-In, and Thompson left for Dallas in the offseason. It seemed the era of the Warriors was over. The start of the 2024-25 season presupposes that may not be the case.\n\nThe Warriors have started the season 4-1. They\u2019ve done that with Curry only playing in three games, and averaging just 18.3 points per game. The team is 2-0 without Curry, so, who has stepped up?\n\nWhile Curry is the NBA\u2019s all-time leader in 3-pointers made, Buddy Hield is close to joining the top 20. He is leading the Warriors with 21.2 points per game while making 50% of his 3-pointers.\n\nMeanwhile, Brandin Podziemski is leading the team at 29.2 minutes per game. He\u2019s posting averages of 10.2 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per contest. Podziemski is one of six Warriors who have averaged double-digit points so far this season.\n\nIf you are looking for reasons to pump the brakes, you can find them.\n\nThe Warriors beat the Trail Blazers and Jazz on the road and beat New Orleans twice at home \u2014 both games after Dejounte Murray\u2019s injury in the season opener.\n\nWhile the schedule has been favorable thus far, this next stretch will challenge them. It starts on Saturday with a visit to Houston. During this road trip, they also play the Celtics, Cavaliers, and Thunder. Then, they return home to face the Mavericks.\n\nThere\u2019s a good chance Curry will return during this trip. If the Warriors have a successful road trip, we may have to consider them title contenders once again. Some things never change."

        "article_content": "It\u2019s that time of year once again. The leaves are changing, the weather is getting colder, and it\u2019s just about time to set your clocks back an hour. That\u2019s right! On Sunday, November 3, daylight saving time officially ends, and you\u2019ll need to set your clocks back an hour.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to know whether your phone will automatically change to daylight saving time or if you need to do it manually. It\u2019s a question that applies regardless of which phone you have. Whether you\u2019re rocking an iPhone 16, Google Pixel 9, Samsung Galaxy S24, or any other smartphone, it\u2019s essential to know whether or not you need to change it for the new time.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nBefore the advent of smart devices, we manually changed the clocks to adjust for either daylight saving time or standard time. However, some clocks, such as wall clocks, oven clocks, and car clocks, are still non-internet-connected and require manual adjustment.\n\nIf your smartphone\u2019s software is up to date, its clock should automatically adjust. But if you had previously customized the date or time settings, you might have to update your clock manually to ensure it\u2019s ready.\n\nWhen is daylight saving time?\n\nThis year, standard time begins at 2 a.m. local time on Sunday, November 3, 2024. It marks the end of daylight saving time, which started on March 10 earlier this year.\n\nRight before your phone clock hits 2 a.m. on Sunday, it should automatically update and \u201cfall back\u201d to 1 a.m. However, in some rare cases, it may not be updated. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll find instructions below on how to fix it.\n\nHow to update your iPhone when daylight saving begins\n\nFirst, let\u2019s look at how to update the time on the iPhone. If you have an iPhone, like the iPhone 16 Pro, go to the Settings app, select General, then Date & Time, and toggle on Set Automatically.\n\nOnce that\u2019s done, your iPhone time will automatically update \u2014 no extra work from you is required! When daylight saving begins, your iPhone won\u2019t skip a beat.\n\nHow to update your Android phone when daylight saving begins\n\nThe process for Android is mostly the same, though it follows a slightly different process. On an Android phone like the Google Pixel 9 Pro, go to Settings > System >Date & Time, and toggle on Set Automatically.\n\nOn a Samsung phone, like the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, you\u2019ll need to follow a slightly different path. Go to Settings > General Management > Date and Time, and make sure Automatic Date and Time is turned on.\n\nWith these settings configured, your Android phone is prepped and ready to automatically change the time once daylight saving time begins for another year.\n\nOther daylight saving phone tips\n\nAlthough the above steps should be all you need to worry about, there are some other things you can do to be extra sure your phone changes when it should for daylight saving time.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t updated your phone in a while, ensure it\u2019s running the latest available software. Open the Settings app on an iPhone, tap General, and then Software Update. If you have an Android phone, go to the Settings app, scroll down the page, and tap on Software update or System update (the wording will be slightly different depending on which Android phone you have).\n\nOutdated software shouldn\u2019t impact your phone automatically changing for standard time, but installing an update if one is available doesn\u2019t hurt. If you have any alarms set on your phone, they\u2019ll also automatically update to the new time without any extra work required from you."
