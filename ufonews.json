        "article_content": "We are not alone in the cosmos. Why isn't UFO hearing tearing up Google trends? | Opinion\n\nYou would think if anything could break through the noise of our news cycle, UFOs could.\n\nThis needs to be a bigger deal folks because the American people, nay people of the world, need this right now.\n\nLast week, for the second time in two years, there was a Congressional subcommittee hearing on UFOs, or as they have been foolishly rebranded \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d shortened to UAPs.\n\nOne of the visionaries helping uncover the truth is none other than Wisconsin Congressman Glenn Grothman, R-Fond du Lac, who chairs the House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs.\n\nEditorial: Hovde's election claims are false. He's blaming Milwaukee \u2013 without evidence.\n\nLast week\u2019s hearing, \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\" including a new slate of witnesses who provided testimony about UFO sightings and what the government may or may not know about them. One witness, Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence officer, went so far to say, \"Excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public, all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nAlien spacecraft and dead extraterrestrials now in Congressional Record\n\nLast year\u2019s testimony included former Pentagon official David Grusch telling a Congressional committee that he\u2019d learned of a decades-long Pentagon program focused on \u201ccrash retrieval and reverse engineering\u201d of UFOs from other planets. Grusch also said that remains found at the spacecraft crash sites were \u201cnon-human biologics.\u201d\n\nYes, crashed alien spacecraft and dead extraterrestrials made it to the Congressional Record.\n\nHowever, neither in the aftermath of last year's and last week's hearing did the terms \"UFO\" \"Alien\" \"UAP\" or even \"government coverup\" break the 25 most searched terms in Google Trends.\n\nWhat were people searching for last week? Would it surprise you if I said: \"mike tyson jake paul fight.\"\n\nTo be fair, neither of these hearings has provided real evidence to prove UFOs or UAPs are extraterrestrial in nature. But the collection of testimony indicates that UAPs are very real in the sense there are a number of as-yet-unexplained phenomena.\n\nAnd yet, apparently, most of us do not care enough to let that information even make a blip on our news cycle.\n\nAll the more reason that right now is the right time for these tight-lipped folks in defense and intelligence departments, whose jobs could very well be on the chopping block anyways in Trump's administration, to just let it rip.\n\nDeclassify everything. Tell us the truth is out there. Then send Biden and Trump out to do a tag team Bill Pullman-Independence Day-esque speech, where they encourage us to not be consumed by our petty differences and instead be united in our common interests. Give us a new enemy!\n\nOr at the very least, declassify everything just to remind humans of our standing in the universe. I don't know who said it first but right now feels like a good time for everyone to remember that we\u2019re, \"just ghosts driving meat coated skeletons made from stardust riding a rock floating through space.\"\n\nKristin Brey is the \"My Take\" columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: House committee answers questions we've long had about ET | Opinion"

Kosloski, the newly-appointed director of AARO, will testify Tuesday before a Senate subcommittee.\n\nAARO released its latest report analyzing more than 700 recent UFO cases last week.\n\nLess than a week ago, whistleblowers in Congress rekindled the notion that high levels of government are concealing evidence of nonhuman intelligent beings and the mystifying vehicles they pilot.\n\nNow, the leader of the Pentagon's office to investigate UFOs is set to provide congressional testimony of his own.\n\nThat agency, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO,) came under heavy fire last Wednesday when a quartet of witnesses appeared before a House committee for its latest foray into the topic of UFOs.\n\nMany sightings AARO has historically investigated are reported by military fighter pilots, some of whom have captured footage on jets' cockpit gun cameras of unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP. The acronym has come to be the government's preferred term for what is still largely known among the public as UFOs, both because it's less stigmatized and because it includes objects seen in not just the air, but the water.\n\nBut despite the Pentagon's recent shows of transparency, some of those who spoke out last week lambasted the military and intelligence agencies for what they see as unnecessary \u2013 and even dangerous \u2013 secrecy shrouding what is known about UAP. The hearing was rife with both criticisms of AARO's March UFO report, as well as accusations that the agency engages in disinformation campaigns to discredit sightings and those in the military who report them.\n\nOn the heels of that hearing, Jon T. Kosloski, the newly-appointed director of AARO, will testify Tuesday before a Senate subcommittee.\n\nHere's what to know about the hearing, and how to watch it.\n\nUFO hearing:Here are the biggest revelations Congress heard\n\nWhen is the Senate UFO hearing? How to watch\n\nKosloski will appear at 4:30 p.m. EST Tuesday to testify before a subcommittee of the Armed Services committee.\n\nInformation on the nature of the hearing is vague, indicating only that Senate subcommittee members will \"receive testimony on the activities of\" AARO.\n\nVideo of the hearing will be available on the committee's website.\n\nHouse heard from UFO whistleblowers last week\n\nNews of the upcoming Senate hearing comes amid the latest round of testimony last week in the halls of Congress about unexplained objects violating U.S. airspace and shadowy programs to recover and study downed craft.\n\nFormer military members and others have for years described witnessing or recording baffling objects in both the skies and waters maneuvering in ways they believed to be beyond known human technology.\n\nLast Wednesday, journalist Michael Shellenberger testified that sources had informed him that intelligence communities are in possession of numerous high-resolution photos and videos of the craft unlike any of the grainy imagery that has so far been declassified.\n\nOne witness, Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence official, described a decades-long international arms race to obtain and reverse-engineer the strange vehicles so governments can bolster their own technology. In corroborating much of the testimony Pentagon intelligence official David Grusch offered in July 2023, Elizondo also accused the Department of Defense of hiding its UFO programs from Congress while misappropriating funds to operate them.\n\nElizondo lambasted the intelligence community for its decades of \"excessive secrecy\" around UAP reports \u2013 \"all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos,\" he said.\n\n\"I believe we as Americans can handle the truth and I also believe the world deserves the truth,\" he said.\n\nLegislators have spent the past year pushing for new laws that would boost UAP transparency, with one seeking to create a civilian reporting mechanism, and one directing the executive branch to declassify certain records. But elected officials and UAP transparency advocates say it hasn't been enough.\n\nWhat is AARO? Pentagon reports have found no evidence of aliens\n\nAs Elizondo made clear last week, laws regarding classified information constrained him and Grusch from publicly presenting hard evidence to support claims of a crash retrieval program, which the Pentagon has repeatedly denied exists.\n\nFor its part, the Pentagon has overseen AARO since its creation in 2022 and created a website in 2023 for the public to access declassified UFO information.\n\nAARO has also released a series of reports with findings on various UFO sightings, all of which end with the same conclusion: That no evidence has been found to suggest that unexplained sightings are extraterrestrial in nature.\n\nAstrophysicists, as well, have long cautioned that the absence of obvious natural explanations for UFOs doesn't make otherworldly ones likely.\n\nIn its most recent report released Thursday, a day after the congressional UFO hearing, AARO studied 757 reports of UAP between May 1, 2023 to June 1, 2024.\n\n\"There are definitely anomalies,\" Kosloski admitted at a briefing last week, adding, \"we have not been able to draw the link to extraterrestrial.\"\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo, USA TODAY\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Advertisement\n\nIn the more than 95 years since it was built, 272 Innisfil St. has been home to a slaughterhouse and an antique market, but according to the team from a popular YouTube series, it\u2019s also home to several ghosts.\n\nRaif Boric and Krista Maryk, who make up two-thirds of the paranormal investigative team of Walking Among Us, spent three hours inside the 25,000-square-foot building near Essa Road earlier this month after they heard of some of the not-so-normal things that have taken place there.\n\nShirley Sanford, owner of Sanford and Son Emporium which is located inside the building, told BarrieToday the team came for a visit on Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cOne of my employees was talking to one of the customers and something was brought up about the spirits that are in that building,\" she said. \"The woman said she knew some people that do the paranormal thing, so she asked if it would be OK if they phone me.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to see what was going on.\u201d\n\nIn the five years that she\u2019s been in the building, Sanford said she\u2019s seen plenty of \u201cunexplainable\u201d things take place.\n\n\u201cAbout three weeks ago, I was up in a booth. Everybody had left and I was doing my rounds at night for closing,\" she said. \"I went into this booth and was looking to see what new things they\u2019d brought in. I could hear a woman and a man's voice \u2026 I thought maybe there was a radio in the booth and it was on low and they\u2019d forgotten to turn it off, but there was no radio.\u201d\n\nSanford poked around a little more, but couldn\u2019t find any source for the noise. And despite being late and alone, she wasn\u2019t fearful.\n\nThe next week while doing her closing routine, Sanford said an Elvis clock started singing.\n\n\u201cThere is an Elvis clock hanging on the wall \u2026 so I thought OK, it\u2019s a motion-sensor thing. I went into the booth and I was singing and dancing and then all of a sudden it shut off,\" she said. \"I went back and forth three times that night into where I had triggered it and nothing.\n\nShirley Sanford is the owner of Sanford and Sons Emporium on Innisfil Street in Barrie. | Nikki Cole/BarrieToday files\n\n\"The next morning when I came into work, I went to try it and nothing. I pulled the clock off the wall and you have to push a button for it to go off,\u201d she said.\n\nShe remembers another incident which included a ladder that was found in the middle of the floor; despite the shop having been closed, it was nearby a spot where she said a man had hanged himself.\n\nThe building has been the scene of five separate deaths, Sanford told BarrieToday, including two suicides, one person who was gored by a cow, and two who were killed in a boiler-room explosion.\n\nAs for what occurred on the property prior to the building\u2019s construction in 1929, she has no idea and said it could very well play a role in the site\u2019s haunting.\n\nRaif Boric, lead investigator for Walking Among Us, said that going into their visit, they didn\u2019t know too much about the structure's history, nor were they aware of what had occurred there over the years.\n\n\u201cIt was just kind of like let\u2019s go and see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met up with Shirley \u2026 and we both went to different spots \u2026 to see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhile he was by himself with the spouse of one of the store\u2019s employees on one side of the building, he says he was drawn to a doll on a shelf, telling BarrieToday he is a collector of \u201chaunted artifacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have six haunted dolls and a haunted teddy bear at home. This doll just drew me in,\" Boric said. \"When it was time to start, I went up to the doll and set up some motion-sensored cat balls, a REM pod (which is a piece of ghost-hunting equipment that indicates changes in ambient temperature) and had my cameras going. This thing would not stop with the motion-sensored cat balls and there were noises going on all in the area,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, I was standing there asking questions and we heard a little girl call out. We looked at each other like \u2018what the (heck) was that!?\u2019\u201d\n\nBoric said they went to explore where the sound came from, which is when he heard Maryk yelling from where she was in the building.\n\n\u201cWe started running back and she was where the doll was \u2026 and asked what all the banging was about,\u201d he said, adding neither he nor the employee\u2019s wife knew what his partner was talking about. \"We\u2019d just heard the kid\u2019s voice, which is where Shirley had heard disembodied voices in the area previously.\u201d\n\nBoric told BarrieToday it felt like a game of cat and mouse trying to track down the spirits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve encountered that a lot, and it sometimes gets a little annoying because you go thinking you\u2019re going to experience something and it just leads you around the building,\" he said. \u201cIt was a good experience and there was a plethora of (paranormal) activity.\"\n\nBoric ended up bringing the \u201chaunted doll\u201d home to add to his collection.\n\n\u201cI have her in the room with the other ones,\" he said. \"I am pretty sure her arm moved the other night, so I am setting up a security camera in the haunted room.\u201d\n\nSanford says she found the entire experience \u201cfascinating,\u201d adding she \"absolutely\" believes in ghosts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get scared over any of this stuff that happens. I am all for it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen these guys came in, I saw it for myself. The white orbs and the one gentleman at the very end had forgotten something upstairs \u2026 When we got up there, one of the revolving showcases was on and (it) hadn\u2019t been on 15 minutes early when we\u2019d been up there.\u201d\n\nThe episode is expected to air on the Walking Among Us YouTube channel in January 2025."

        "article_content": "For many, the thought of creating a budget can feel overwhelming\u2014even financial experts sometimes call it the dreaded \"B word.\" But budgeting doesn\u2019t have to be stressful or restrictive. Instead, it\u2019s a way to gain clarity about your money, make informed choices, and work toward your financial goals. With the right approach, budgeting can feel less like a chore and more like a powerful tool to create the life you want.\n\nKey Takeaways Budgeting is a simple financial tool with many benefits.\n\nThose benefits include becoming more conscious of your spending, setting priorities, achieving short- and long-term goals, and avoiding needless debt.\n\nThere are a variety of resources that can make budgeting easier.\n\nUnderstanding Budgeting\n\nA budget is a simple tool for getting a clear picture of where your money comes from, where it goes, and how you can make positive changes in your financial life if you need or want to. It puts you in control of your money rather than the other way around.\n\nThe Benefits of Budgeting\n\nCreating a budget can have a slew of benefits\u2014especially if you manage to stick to it. For example, you'll:\n\nKnow where your money goes and how to cut back if you have to.\n\nHave greater control over your spending and avoid (or get out of) unnecessary debt.\n\nBe able to set and achieve larger financial goals, whether it's taking a vacation, making the down payment on a home, or doing whatever is important to you.\n\nSteps to Create a Budget\n\nA budget can be as simple or as complicated as you choose to make it. At a minimum, you'll want to add up all of your income from work or other sources and list all of your expenses. It may be helpful to sort your expenses into broad categories, such as housing, food, transportation, etc.\n\nYour large, regular expenses\u2014such as rent or mortgage, car loan payments, utility bills, and so forth\u2014should be easy to track. But many of us also find our money trickles out in other ways we don't always notice. For that reason, it can be useful to keep a record for a week or two of everything you spend money on.\n\nIf you find that your expenses exceed your income, a budget can help you spot places to cut back. One way to do that is to divide your expenses into essentials and everything else. The \"everything else\" category will be the easier one to cut from if you have to.\n\nIt's also worth allotting some money to that essentials category for an emergency fund or a retirement account.\n\nOvercoming Budgeting Challenges\n\nIn some cases you may have to rely on your best guesses. For example, if your income is irregular, you'll need to estimate how much you might bring in during the coming months. As a general rule it's best to predict on the low side\u2014and to be happily surprised if things go better than expected.\n\nTools and Resources for Budgeting\n\nYou can create a budget on a sheet of notebook paper if that works for you. Or you can use a spreadsheet program like Excel or accounting software like Quicken. Many budgeting apps are also available.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBudgeting is the simplest and fastest way to get a grip on your finances and make your money work for you. If you've never created a budget before, you might find you actually enjoy it."
