            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nOver a span of several days last week, multiple sightings of UFOs were made in the Fresno, California area with no explanation ever revealed. A couple of the UFO sightings were even reported to the local airport tower by pilots.\n\nThe first UFO sighting occurred early in the morning when a light was recorded in the sky by a news tower camera just after 4 a.m. Fox 26 News reported that \u201cthe light appeared to hover over downtown Fresno.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you see that object move at the clip it moves and it\u2019s hovering again,\u201d said Earl Grey Anderson from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), who reviewed the footage. \u201cThat one I would probably actually give an unknown classification to which is a UFO.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I thought was very interesting about the second video is the clip. It suddenly moves. I\u2019m not sure what distance we\u2019re looking at there. It wasn\u2019t light speed or anything like that but that was awfully fast. You\u2019ve got an interesting capture there somebody saw what I would technically call a UFO.\u201d\n\nThe day after the initial UFO sighting, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara captured video of another UFO in the time, this time in broad daylight.\n\nThree days later, during the afternoon, a private pilot radioed the Fresno airport tower with a report of something unidentified in the sky. A second pilot reported an object following him at 3,500 feet.\n\nTower: \u201cYou saw something over downtown at 3,500?\u201d Pilot: \u201cCorrect. It looked like a white object.\u201d Tower: \u201cHow long was this?\u201d Pilot: \u201cI just lost it right now.\u201d\n\nSeveral other people in the area also reported taking video of similar objects in the sky at the time. Jeanette Herrera of Fresno reported seeing it on back-to-back days, and it\u2019s not the first time she has seen UFOs over the city.\n\n\u201cI saw that one video of the orb and I was like\u2026 well, wait a second. I\u2019ve got good video of these things,\u201d said Herrera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve filmed that particular orb at least three or four times in the last two weeks,\u201d Herrera continued, \u201cIt almost does this like firework thing where it blows up and then reappears in a different area. So, it just does that constantly and then sometimes it won\u2019t. It\u2019ll just stay like a little solid looking orb.\u201d\n\nA Fresno police helicopter, which investigated the one of the pilot\u2019s reports, and efforts to reach the Federal Aviation Administration in Fresno both proved fruitless for providing an explanation for the mysterious UFO sightings."

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nChina's Big Tech firms are striving to catch up with their US counterparts while facing budget constraints and limited access to advanced chips. This has pushed them to innovate in AI model efficiency, refining their products within the country's closed market.\n\nByteDance's ChatGPT-like Doubao bot has emerged as the most popular AI app for Chinese consumers. Photo: Simon Song alt=ByteDance's ChatGPT-like Doubao bot has emerged as the most popular AI app for Chinese consumers. Photo: Simon Song>\n\nBenchmark tests have shown that Doubao 1.5 Pro excels in half of 14 evaluations that assessed the model's language understanding, maths and coding skills, domain knowledge, visual understanding and reasoning abilities.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn some areas it outperformed industry-leading AI systems from Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google, and Amazon.com-backed Anthropic. It also bested domestic rivals in some tests, including systems from recent start-up darling DeepSeek and cloud computing giant Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the Post.\n\nByteDance's resource-efficient AI development strategy follows the success of Hangzhou-based DeepSeek, which stunned the global tech community with its V3 model unveiled late last year. DeepSeek's open-source V3 was trained using significantly fewer resources than Meta Platforms' Llama 3.1, while delivering comparable performance.\n\nDeepSeek disclosed in the model's technical report that it was trained using Nvidia's H800 chips at a cost of less than US$6 million. By comparison, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei estimated that OpenAI spent US$100 million on training GPT-4o.\n\nByteDance did not disclose the cost or chips used for training its latest model, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ability to advance AI models while managing resource constraints is playing a more important role in the industry amid an escalating US-China tech rivalry.\n\nDespite US restrictions, Chinese companies continue to make strides in AI development. The Doubao 1.5 Pro release came days after DeepSeek and Beijing-based Moonshot AI launched new reasoning models this week.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

            "article_content": "Credit: Rainer Fuhrmann/Shutterstock\n\nAccording to a 2022 poll from YouGov, 39% of Americans believe they have some form of paranormal ability. About a quarter of that group think they can sense other people's auras or emotion; 15% say they can hear voices or sounds from ghosts; and about 13% think they can see events from the past or future.\n\nThis is a public service announcement to the nearly 13 million Americans who believe they have supernatural powers: You are leaving a lot of money on the table. Various groups of skeptics worldwide have put a total of $1,408,424 (and one goat) on the table, and all that filthy lucre is just waiting to be collected by anyone who can manifest paranormal power.\n\nThe specific kinds of powers you need to demonstrate to win the prizes run the gamut. Dutch organization Stichting Skepsis will shell out 12 grand to practitioners of some forms of alternative medicine who can demonstrate its effectiveness (so if you're into applied kinesiology, give 'em a shot), and you can get a free goat from Fayetteville Freethinkers for proving a \"fulfilled Biblical prophecy.\" But whether you're able to see the future, move objects with your mind, or talk to spirits, there's a prize out there for you.\n\nThe history of paranormal prizes\n\nThe first monetary prize for proof of paranormal activity was offered by Scientific American in 1922. In the midst of the spiritualism movement, the publication offered $2,500 for anyone who could produce a \"spirit photograph\" (a photo that captures an image of a ghost) under controlled conditions, and $2,500 for anyone able to produce a \"visible psychic manifestation.\"\n\nFamous (at the time) medium George Valiantine gave it a shot and was able to create the illusion of a trumpet floating in the air in a dark room, but the test committee (which included Harry Houdini) had connected his chair to a light in an adjoining room, which lit up whenever Valiantine left his chair, which was also every time the trumpet appeared. Valiantine was proven a fraud, and Scientific American kept their cash.\n\nThe most famous bounty for psychic ability is the One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge offered by the James Randi Educational Foundation. Randi, a magician turned professional skeptic, first offered a prize of $1,000 back in 1964, but the cash grew to a million by 1996. Between 1964 and 2015 when the prize was discontinued, over 1,000 people applied, but none were successful at demonstrating their supernatural power under controlled conditions. No remote viewers were able to remote view. No dowsers were able to find hidden objects. No mind reader was able to read minds.\n\nHow paranormal prizes can backfire\n\nYou'd think that a 100% failure rate might make people question the reality of psychic abilities, but for a lot of people, public failure can make psychic abilities seem more plausible. At least that's how it worked for Uri Geller. Geller, who's still around and still claiming supernatural power, began gaining attention in the early 1970s for his supposed ability to bend spoons with his mind.\n\nWhile he never tried for James Randi's prize, the two had a famous run-in on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show that demonstrated the problems with disproving paranormal activity. Carson, who had been magician, was skeptical of Geller's claims, and brought him on his show and presented him with some tests that Randi helped develop.\n\nIf you want to see some uncomfortable TV, check it out:\n\nIf you don't have the 20 minutes to spare, Carson lets Geller take his time and try any of a series of test of his ability, but Geller can't. With Carson watching carefully and not allowing Geller control of any of the props, Geller can't bend a spoon with his mind; he can't determine whether a container holds water. He can't do anything.\n\nYou'd think a public failure this complete would have ended Geller's career, but it had the opposite effect. Geller blamed his failure on \"not feeling strongly\" and claimed he might have been \"blocking himself\" that night. Many apparently saw Geller's failure as proof that he was the real thing; after all, if he was a magician, the tricks would have worked. Geller then became a popular guest on other talk shows where he was able to perform his tricks successfully under less controlled conditions, and a star was born.\n\nWhy disproving anything is difficult\n\nWhile Uri Geller and other high-profile psychics are performers and are no doubt aware of how they're achieving their results, the 13 million or so Americans who believe they possess special powers aren't being deceitful\u2014it's just easy to believe in the supernatural. When something unusual happens, when a one-in-a-million occurrence occurs, it's easy to see that as proof of a mysterious, unexplainable something. If you're thinking about a friend and they text you that very minute, how can you not see that as evidence of some weird connection? But one-in-a-million events happen to over 300 people in America every single day, and there's no James Randi or Johnny Carson around to provide a controlled experiment to prove it's just a coincidence, to explain that you probably think of people all the time who don't text you that minute.\n\nBut maybe I'm wrong. If I am, there's over a million dollars and a goat out there waiting for the right person to come along and claim them."

            "article_content": "Steven Soderbergh has never made a horror movie, and certainly not of the ghostly, haunted variety. His movies tend to be exacting, precise, so even when they\u2019re frightening, as with the stalker nightmare Unsane or the chilling disease thriller Contagion, that fear comes from witnessing a process failing with just as much efficiency as when it succeeds. Death, as depicted in his new horror thriller Presence, has no such clarity of success and failure. The sense of loss left behind feels like a kind of failure, yet it is both inevitable and unknowable. These are some of the mysteries eating away at teenage Chloe (Callina Liang), who has just lost her best friend Nadia to a drug overdose and is now moving into a new house with her semi-functional family.\n\nYes, it\u2019s the old something-not-quite-right-with-this-house-that\u2019s-supposed-to-solve-everything business: Chloe feels shivers of offness in her new home, which concerns her sweet-natured but frustrated father Chris (Chris Sullivan) and mostly annoys her jock brother Tyler (Eddy Maday)\u2014who is the clear favorite of distracted mother Rebecca (Lucy Liu), further bedeviled by some vague but obviously Soderberghian financial malfeasance at work. As far as Rebecca is concerned, that\u2019s the issue that should require discussion in hushed tones, not the creaks and chills of otherness that Chloe feels. Is it Nadia, Chloe wonders? Or just, as her parents assume, an expression of her grief and loneliness?\n\nThe identity question may linger, but there\u2019s no fake suspense over whether Chloe is imagining things. To depict this haunting, Soderbergh imposes a system onto a spiritual dimension where none should necessarily exist: He shoots the entire movie from the point of view of an unseen spirit that does indeed drift through the house; \u201cpresence\u201d is also, essentially, the title character. It\u2019s a Paranormal Activity movie turned inside-out: Rather than a largely stationary camera capturing flickers of spooky but eerily realistic movement in the frame, the camera remains mobile and hovering, its ghostliness an invisible but driving force. Like the Paranormal films, there is an element of surveillance: The camera travels through rooms unnoticed, overhearing bits of conversation and observing actions kept secret from other characters. It\u2019s at once omniscient and deeply subjective. There\u2019s also another technical challenge on hand for Soderbergh, who has professed far more affinity for the cut than the epically long take: to stay true to his POV gimmick, most scenes are staged in single unbroken shots. Cuts move forward in time, not within a scene.\n\nThe simultaneous braininess and gimmickry of this technique, applied to a David Koepp screenplay that unapologetically eschews A Ghost Story-style metaphysical traversing, could have stranded Presence in a liminal zone between shlock and airless experiment. What Soderbergh winds up achieving is more reminiscent of his throwback crime pictures, like the Criss Cross remake The Underneath or more recent thrillers like the period noir No Sudden Move and the intensely Early 2020s Kimi. That is to say that Presence has the story, limited scope, and 85-minute runtime of a 1940s B-picture, infused\u2014as those pictures often were, and as his crime movies usually are\u2014with a disciplined style and contemporary electricity. It\u2019s budget Gothic that\u2019s worth every penny and then some.\n\nIn that context, it\u2019s less surprising that Soderbergh didn\u2019t recruit anyone from his ever-growing unofficial rep company for this cast: No Matt Damon as the dad, no Catherine Zeta-Jones as the mom, no Riley Keough as a cool aunt dropping by. (Julia Fox, however, does have one scene as a real-estate agent. No word on whether she\u2019s bumpin\u2019 that.) The central quartet playing the family all does wonderful work, and in a movie with several talented young performers, frequent stage/TV/character actor Sullivan feels like the belated discovery as the flustered but loving father. The familial relationships that Soderbergh and Koepp set up aren\u2019t necessarily wide-ranging or unpredictable, but as Presence ticks toward an inevitable confrontation, they\u2019re surprisingly involving. There\u2019s a circularity to Presence that is both entirely in keeping with a haunted-house story and, in this telling, even moving. It\u2019s yet another genre that Soderbergh has worked like a problem, and produced an elegant solution.\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nWriter: David Koepp\n\nStarring: Callina Liang, Chris Sullivan, Lucy Liu, Eddy Maday, Julia Fox\n\nRelease Date: January 24, 2025"

            "article_content": "Julia Fox has an unexpected roommate: a ghost named Beauty, who lives in the basement of her New York home. During a Jan. 21 episode of Late Night, Fox recalled how she was introduced to the paranormal spirit after moving into her house. But according to Fox, she has no problems with living in a haunted house. Apparently, Beauty only brings good energy, and Fox now considers the ghost to be the \u201cmatriarch of the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually have a ghost that lives in my house right now,\u201d Fox told Seth Meyers on the show. \u201cI feel like I talk about her a lot, and I feel so bad. I'm, like, putting her on blast. Like, I don't know if she wants me to talk about her! Her name is Beauty, and she came with the house; she didn't follow me there.\u201d\n\nWhen Fox first moved in, she didn\u2019t know about Beauty. \u201cIt was funny: It begins like any ghost story. I felt a pull toward this house, and it was a full moon, and then I was like, \u2018That's it. I'm getting the house,\u2019\u201d she explained to Meyers. \u201cAnd then when we went down to the basement after we'd already moved all our stuff in, there was a little letter from the previous owners basically saying, like, \u2018This is Beauty.\u2019 And it had all her things: her hairbrush, her mirror.\u201d\n\nNBC/NBCUniversal/Getty Images\n\nMeyers clarified, \u201cWait, the owners waited 'til you moved in and then left a note in the basement?\u201d He added, \u201cThat is some really dirty \u2014 I've heard some bad New York real estate stuff...\u201d Fox replied, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nDespite the bait-and-switch, Fox appreciates her unexpected housemate. \u201cShe's wonderful. She's like the matriarch of the house,\u201d she added. Apparently, her three-year-old son, Valentino, is also a fan. \u201cShe watches over us, and we love her. My son actually sees her. I don't see her, but my son will say, \u2018I saw her, I saw her.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Fox has discussed Beauty. In January 2024, she gave a similar update during a red carpet interview, shared on Instagram by Sundance. (At the time, Fox was promoting her horror film Presence, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The film \u2014 a ghost story \u2014 comes out in theaters on Jan. 24. She was also promoting the project on Late Night.) \u201cShe lived in the house for pretty much her whole life, and we have a whole shrine to her in our basement,\u201d Fox said of Beauty at the time. \u201cShe\u2019s a nice ghost, so we\u2019re not worried.\u201d"

            "article_content": "NASA's Curiosity Rover has been exploring Mars since 2012 and more recently has found evidence of ice-free ancient ponds and lakes on the surface. The rover found small undulations like those seen in sandy lakebeds on Earth.\n\nThey would have been created by wind-driven water moving back and forth across the surface. The inescapable conclusion is that the water would have been open to the elements instead of being covered by ice. The discovery suggests the ripples formed 3.7 billion years ago.\n\nMars is the fourth planet in our Solar System and the second smallest of all the major planets. It's known for its strong red colour which is caused by iron oxide in the surface material.\n\nClassed as a terrestrial planet, Mars is similar in many ways to Earth, with valleys, volcanoes, and even evidence of dried-up river beds. The similarities end there, though, with polar caps made mostly of carbon dioxide ice, an unbreathable atmosphere, and a surface that is cold and dry.\n\nIt's always held a special fascination for us due largely to vague hints through the centuries of alien intelligence, but more recently that it may have once been habitable.\n\nA full-disk view of Mars, courtesy of VMC. (ESA)\n\nOne such rover that has been exploring the Martian landscape is the Curiosity Rover that was sent by NASA in 2011. It arrived at Mars in August 2012 and has been exploring the region around Gale Crater ever since.\n\nThe main objective of Curiosity is to investigate the climate and geology and to assess if they could have supported primitive life in the past.\n\nTo achieve that end, it's equipped with an array of instruments, from drills to collect soil samples to cameras and instruments to analyse atmospheric samples.\n\nNew simulations are helping inform the Curiosity rover's ongoing sampling campaign. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS)\n\nIn a paper recently published in the journal Science Advances by Caltech's John Grotzinger, Harold Brown, Professor of Geology, and Michael Lamb, Professor of Geology, shared their findings.\n\nThey found two sets of what seem to be ancient wave ripples on the surface of Mars, now thought to be dried-up bodies of water with the ripples preserved in rock.\n\nThe ripples are tiny undulations and are often seen in beaches and lakebeds on Earth as wind-driven water flows across the shallows. The team is particularly excited that this means the water was not frozen and was once open to the elements as liquid.\n\nThe ripples discovered by Curiosity in Gale Crater are the strongest evidence to date that there have been bodies of liquid water in the history of the red planet. Analysis of the rocks and ripples suggests they formed 3.7 billion years ago.\n\nIt's thought that the atmosphere and climate of Mars must have been far warmer than today and more dense. Dense enough to support liquid water in open air.\n\nNASA's Curiosity rover continues to search for signs that Mars' Gale Crater conditions could support microbial life. (NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS)\n\nThe team was able to create computer models from the ripples they found to attempt to discover the size of the lake. The size of the ripples and separation helps to determine how much water was present.\n\nThe ripple height of 6 mm and 4 to 5 cm separation tell us that the lake was shallow, possibly even less than 2 meters deep.\n\nOne of the sets of ripples known as the Prow outcrop was found in an area that was once wind-blown dunes. The other set was found nearby in the sulfate-rich Amapari Marker Band of rocks.\n\nThe two regions come from slightly different times, telling us that the warm, dense atmosphere occurred multiple times or at least for a long period of time.\n\nThe discovery has been a massive help to Mars paleoclimate studies that have tried to map the changing conditions on Mars.\n\nNASA's Opportunity rover was the first mission to discover ripples on the surface, but the nature of the bodies of water was uncertain.\n\nThis latest discovery has given a fascinating insight into the early conditions on Mars, with perhaps bodies of liquid dotted across the landscape. Further investigation is needed to see how commonplace the ripples are.\n\nThis article was originally published by Universe Today. Read the original article."

            "article_content": "OpenAI is reportedly preparing for the launch of Operator sometime this week. Operator is name of its computer-use agent that can complete tasks in a user\u2019s web browser on their behalf. Other companies including Google and Anthropic have been developing similar \u201cagents\u201d in hopes they will be the next major leap towards AI fulfilling its promise of being able to perform tasks currently done by humans.\n\nAccording to The Information, which first reported on the impending launch, Operator will provide users with suggested prompts in categories like travel and dining and events. Users could, for instance, ask Operator to find a good flight from New York to Maui that would not have them landing too late in the evening. Operator will not complete a transaction\u2014the user will remain in the loop and complete the checkout process.\n\nGizmodo has reached out to OpenAI for comment but has not heard back.\n\nIt is easy to imagine certain ways Operator could be useful. Aging individuals who are not computer savvy could potentially ask Operator to help them send an email, and see it navigate to Gmail and open a compose window for them. Tech savvy people do not need this type of help, but older generators often struggle navigating the web and completing even simple tasks is a challenge. Bots could help in other areas as well, such as in quality-assurance testing where companies need to test that their new websites or services work properly.\n\nSo-called \u201ccomputer use agents\u201d do come with potential risks. We have already seen a startup introduce a web-navigating bot to automate the process of posting marketing spam to Reddit. Bots that take control of the end-user client are able to bypass API limitations meant to block automation. AI startups will need to take some measures to combat abuse, or else websites will become even more flooded with spam than they are today.\n\nThese agents like Operator essentially work by taking screenshots of a user\u2019s browser and sending the images back to OpenAI for analysis. Once its models determine the next step necessary to complete a task, a command is sent back to the browser to move and click the mouse on the appropriate target, or type into an input box. It takes advantage of multi-modal technology OpenAI and others have been developing that can interpret multiple forms of input, in this case text and imagery.\n\nThe entire promise of a recent crop of AI startups is that they will be able to create an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that can replace humans on most tasks they perform today and make everyone\u2019s lives more efficient. As exponential gains in the performance of language models have slowed, these companies have been looking for new unlocks that will get them there, and computer use agents are one. An artificial intelligence can not truly replace humans until it can physically complete the tasks for them\u2014writing is just part of a task. Bots also need to be able to navigate spreadsheets, watch videos, and more.\n\nAfter Anthropic released an initial preview of its computer use bot, early testers complained it was half-baked at best, getting stuck in loops when it does not know what to do or forgetting the task and starting to do something else entirely, like looking at pictures of nature on Google Images. It is also slow, and expensive to operate.\n\nKeeping humans in the loop will be essential with a bot that is granted such high-level control and access to critical data. It seems like perhaps computer-use agents will be akin to self-driving cars. Google was able to make a car drive down a straightaway on its own easy enough, but the edge-case scenarios have taken years to solve.\n\nThere is debate on how to measure AGI and when it will be \u201cachieved,\u201d but OpenAI has told its biggest backer Microsoft that it believes AGI will be reached once it has created an AI that can generate at least $100 billion in profit. That is a lofty goal considering OpenAI predicts it will generate $12 billion in revenue in 2025 while still losing billions.\n\nAt the same time, neither Microsoft nor Google has seen enterprise customers willing to adopt AI tools as fast as they hoped. Instead of charging $20-30 per employee to add AI tools into their bundles, both companies are now shoving AI into their standard bundles and hiking the prices by a couple of dollars respectively."

            "article_content": "The UK retail industry is at a pivotal juncture, driven by technological advancements, evolving consumer expectations, and a heightened focus on sustainability. With 2025 on the horizon, retailers are keenly adapting to key trends that promise to redefine the shopping experience. From artificial intelligence-enhanced operations to the rise of ethical retailing, along with innovative financial solutions, these developments are all playing a crucial role in shaping the future of retail.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and machine learning power personalised retail\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing the retail industry, driving significant transformations across businesses of all sizes. While large multinational retailers are at the forefront of adopting these technologies, other sectors, including healthcare and iGaming platforms like crypto casinos UK players can sign up to are also finding innovative ways to harness AI-driven insights.\n\nAcross sectors, AI is being used to provide highly customized client experiences. In the casino sector, personalised promos and game suggestions based on user history are just two uses of AI. Elsewhere, machine learning algorithms are enhancing operational efficiency by optimising inventory levels, predicting demand, and improving supply chain management.\n\nAI chatbots and virtual assistants are becoming indispensable in customer service, offering instant support and resolving queries in real time. Studies indicate that retailers using AI and ML have witnessed an increase in sales and a boost in profitability.\n\nOmnichannel retail becomes the new norm\n\nConsumers increasingly expect a seamless shopping journey across multiple channels, whether they\u2019re browsing online, visiting a physical store, or using a mobile app. As a result, retailers are doubling down on their omnichannel strategies to create a unified experience.\n\nKey initiatives include the implementation of Click and Collect services, real-time inventory visibility across platforms, and streamlined return processes. Retailers are also investing in mobile-friendly shopping platforms, ensuring customers can switch between devices without losing progress in their shopping journeys.\n\n\n\nA notable example is the integration of social media with e-commerce platforms. Through social commerce, brands are allowing consumers to shop directly through platforms like Instagram and TikTok, blurring the line between social engagement and online retail.\n\nSustainability takes centre stage\n\nEnvironmental consciousness has become a deciding factor for today\u2019s consumers, prompting retailers to prioritise sustainability. From product sourcing to packaging, every aspect of retail operations is being scrutinised for its environmental impact.\n\nMajor players in the UK market, including grocery giants and fashion retailers, are stepping up their efforts to reduce carbon footprints. Initiatives such as switching to biodegradable packaging, committing to zero waste, and promoting circular fashion through resale or rental services are becoming increasingly common.\n\nRetailers that emphasise transparency in their supply chains and communicate their sustainability goals effectively are finding favour with environmentally conscious shoppers. This trend is not only shaping buying behaviour but also fostering brand loyalty among a growing segment of eco-minded consumers.\n\nAdvanced technologies streamline operations\n\nTechnological innovation continues to drive efficiencies in the retail sector. A prominent development in this regard is the gradual replacement of traditional barcodes with QR codes. Unlike barcodes, QR codes can store more information and offer consumers additional product details, enhancing the overall shopping experience.\n\nLeading UK supermarkets, including Tesco and Ocado, have already begun rolling out QR codes on select products, such as milk cartons. This move is part of a broader trend towards digitisation aimed at improving both back-end operations and front-end customer interaction.\n\nIn addition to QR codes, retailers are adopting in-store technologies such as smart shelves and automated checkout systems to enhance convenience. The ultimate goal is to reduce friction at various touchpoints, making shopping faster and more enjoyable for consumers.\n\nRising trend: responsible consumerism and the decline of \u2018haul culture\u2019\n\nThe introduction of \u2018haul culture,\u2019 popularised by social media, has led to increased consumption and, consequently, higher return rates. This phenomenon, driven by younger consumers eager to showcase their shopping hauls online, poses significant challenges for retailers in terms of logistics and sustainability.\n\nIn response, many brands are adopting strategies to curb excessive returns, including improved product descriptions, enhanced sizing tools, and augmented reality (AR) fitting solutions. Retailers are also working to educate consumers on the environmental impact of returns and promote thoughtful purchasing habits.\n\nAdditionally, there is a growing emphasis on responsible consumerism. Retailers are encouraging shoppers to make more sustainable choices by highlighting the longevity and ethical sourcing of products. This trend reflects a broader cultural shift towards mindful consumption and away from fast fashion and impulsive buying.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe retail landscape in 2025 is set for significant transformation as businesses adapt to technological advancements, sustainability pressures, and changing consumer behaviours. Retailers that successfully navigate these trends stand to benefit from increased customer loyalty, operational efficiencies, and long-term profitability.\n\nAs AI-driven personalisation, omnichannel experiences, and ethical practices become standard, the future of retail promises to be both exciting and dynamic. Brands that remain agile and responsive to these developments will not only survive but thrive in this evolving marketplace."

            "article_content": "At this past week\u2019s ICR Conference in Orlando, cautious optimism floated beneath the current of two, inflation-strapped years of challenges. Traffic remains soft. Operators are competing for fewer visits among weary consumers. But solutions around \u201cvalue\u201d are starting to emerge, whether it\u2019s $5 deals pulsed into the marketplace at the top of QSR, or working on loyalty, engagement, and service for those clarifying the \u201cworth\u201d of higher prices.\n\nAccording to Revenue Management Solutions, the quick-service industry ended the year with a traffic increase of 0.8 percent in Q4, year-over-year, namely thanks to October and November. December traffic (weather, holiday trends) came in at negative 1.3 percent compared to 2023, which was also in the red.\n\nThe lead point, though, is net sales stayed positive at 4 percent, with price hikes stabilizing. Average check rose 3.4 percent, down from double-digits in year\u2019s past.\n\nAs was noted throughout ICR presentations, many QSRs recognize today they\u2019ve just about tapped the price ceiling. So they\u2019ve started to turn to other options to satisfy a cautious consumer. RMS advised operators focus on digital, where average checks can be 25 percent higher, consider the \u201cin-crowd\u201d (one case being the popularity of specialty beverages and other Gen Z trends, like KFC\u2019s Saucy Concept), and shift focus to quality/quantity for the price.\n\nNCR Voyix Corporation found, through survey data, 36 percent of consumers in the past six months dined at a fast-casual restaurant more than five times. Comparatively, 26 percent did so at in full service. Fifty-five percent added they cut back on delivery due to inflation, either ordering less in general (38 percent) or trying less expensive restaurants (17 percent).\n\nPrice impacted tipping as well\u201452 percent of guests said they now tip less or only at sit-down meals. What tech would those same diners like to see more of from restaurants? Self-service kiosks (39 percent), table-top ordering (37 percent), and digital payments (32 percent) rounded out the top three.\n\nWilliam Blair, in its ninth edition of The Dining Download, which quarterly examines restaurant trends through polls, found respondents spent, on average, $195 at restaurants monthly, down 10 percent, year-over-year. There was a decline for those with annual incomes less than $150,000 partly offset by growth among more affluent people. By age, restaurant spending slid across all cohorts\u2014albeit more resilient for those under 30, with only a 1 percent drop.\n\nThe percent of polled consumers spending less than last year climbed to 42 percent, up 6 points sequentially. That mark was a new survey high after being largely range-bound over the past two years. William Blair credited increased trade down to less expensive menu items.\n\nThat said, though, there were some encouraging signs in this latest iteration for frequency and larger check management behavior, with \u201cvisiting less often\u201d and \u201cordering fewer items\u201d both decreasing sequentially as reasons cited by those spending less.\n\nPut in plain terms, customers could be considering a ramp up as 2025 gets underway (past the Southern weather challenges). But how will they find the restaurants they return to?\n\nThe answer to that question has become the new definition of \u201cvalue\u201d in a quick-service sector where segment lines have narrowed. Some casual dining (Chili\u2019s) chains have gone as far as building campaigns around the similarity in price to brands like McDonald\u2019s, but with service models that give them an edge.\n\nMORE: Check out October\u2019s survey results\n\nThe percent of respondents \u201ceating less than last year\u201d in William Blair\u2019s report outpaced those eating \u201cmore often\u201d for nearly two-thirds of brands in its coverage area. The most unfavorable gap came at The Cheesecake Factory, Chipotle, Dave & Buster\u2019s, and Starbucks (this was the case last survey as well).\n\nStill, every brand William Blair tracked experienced a sequential increase in \u201ceating more often,\u201d led by improvement at Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Shake Shack, CAVA, and Chipotle. That aforementioned \u201ccautious optimism\u201d appears to be cracking through, although there\u2019s still plenty of ground to make up after multiple years of deteriorating guest counts.\n\nStarbucks posting 8.3 percent on the line (as well as being the only negative result in \u201ceating less often\u201d) was a notable shift, even if it also reflected just how deep the value hole had become.\n\nStarbucks in the last survey, back in October, was on the opposite side\u2014the very bottom at negative 2.5 percent for \u201ceating more often.\u201d The brand, of course, has made several changes in CEO Brian Niccol\u2019s tenure thus far\u2014new algorithms that enable on-time mobile-order handoffs and order tracking/timing to store decor to the launch of Cortados, removing upcharges for non-dairy milk, and refocusing messaging on coffee-centric campaigns. But much of Starbucks\u2019 reroute lies ahead, especially when it comes to Siren upgrades and other operational improvements (more on that here).\n\nWhen asked why they were eating less at specific restaurant brands, \u201cinconvenient\u201d topped the list (cited for more than 70 percent of brands) followed by \u201ctoo expensive\u201d (Starbucks, Chipotle, and BJ\u2019s Restaurants). Sweetgreen was the only concept where \u201clack of interesting new menu items\u201d clocked as the top reason for visiting less often.\n\nAgain, focusing on Starbucks, this list is pretty similar to October, when it broke down as follows:\n\nToo expensive: 52 percent\n\nInconvenient: 17 percent\n\nSpending on other things/restaurants: 12 percent\n\nLack of interesting new menu items: 7 percent\n\nHealth/diet: 5 percent\n\nSlow speed of service: zero percent\n\nGoing by this data, Starbucks\u2019 greatest whitespace seems to center on making its experience and product feel worthy of its cost. Naturally, it\u2019s an easier-said-than-done point and one Niccol addressed right from the jump of his appointment. Atop that task list is getting throughput times under four minutes; making the customization process more transparent from a pricing perspective; properly staffing units to create calmer and more efficient restaurants; bring condiment bars back; and fostering a more enjoyable caf\u00e9 experience. \u201cOur customers find worth through quality, consistency, and a sense of value,\u201d Niccol said earlier. For a brand that\u2019s never been \u201ccheap,\u201d getting back to being an \u201caffordable luxury\u201d will be a holistic effort that\u2019s the furthest thing from discounting or a race to the bottom. There\u2019s a reason Niccol has called the effort \u201cBack to Starbucks.\u201d\n\nCustomers in William Blair\u2019s survey continued to rank the value proposition of restaurants as modestly above average at 3.4 (5 being the highest). It\u2019s a factor on the rise. Portillo\u2019s, Kura Sushi, The Cheesecake Factory, and BJ\u2019s provided this survey\u2019s largest gains. On an absolute basis, Portillo\u2019s topped in value perception.\n\nThat reality, in of itself, is intriguing when you consider the Chicago-born cult-favorite has elected to avoid discounting during this stretch. CEO Michael Osanloo said in Q3 Portillo\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be \u201cgoing on sale\u201d to counter competitors\u2019 promotions. Portillo\u2019s stayed relatively cautious on price and has held on quality and operational efforts. The chain took zero action in Q3. Its price benefit was about 4 percent in Q4\n\nBut from a wider sentiment angle, Osanloo said, Portillo\u2019s elected to absorb traffic blows rather than chase short-term wins over the past two years. \u201cPortillo\u2019s does not play the discount game,\u201d he said in Q3. \u201cWe compete on great everyday pricing for our craveable food and abundant portions, and we know this approach will benefit us in the medium and long term.\u201d\n\nPortillo\u2019s at ICR had one of the buzzier presentations, thanks in large part to its decision to load digital wallets onto customer\u2019s loyalty plates instead of an app. Yet the brand also presented a blueprint to regaining traffic and growing long-term through efforts such as smaller store designs, kiosks, and improved speed of service in the drive-thru instead of value-focused menu launches. It\u2019s clear there will be more than one approach for quick service to win back traffic in 2025.\n\nOther trends in behavior\n\nDespite all the hurdles, engagement remains healthy. William Blair\u2019s survey showed 87 percent of respondents ate at restaurants \u201cat least a few\u201d times a month in December (9 percent said they do so daily). Those figures were 80 and 79 percent in September and June, respectively. Yet, to an earlier observation, consumers estimated their monthly spending was down 10 percent, year-over-year, and 42 percent added they were spending less relative to the prior year.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s the ICR-revealed cocktail of hesitant traffic patterns and hints of improving trends.\n\nGiven U.S. Census Bureau data had shown stable consumer spending through December, William Blair said, part of this step-down could be explained by a shift in its demographic poll this past quarter. In that, there are some learnings, too. More younger guests responded this survey, showing, perhaps, that group of diners has proven more apt to return to restaurants, even if they\u2019re managing checks when they do so.\n\nThe percentage of guests ordering food either a few times a week or daily was 54 percent for respondents under 60, compared with only 42 percent over 60. There was also visible correlation to income level\u201456 percent of people earning north of $100,000 said they ordered food a few times a week or daily versus those earnings less than $50,000, where only 45 percent claimed the same.\n\nReported restaurant interactions held up as well. William Blair data found an estimated 11 interactions per month this quarter, 13 percent higher than December 2023. Off-premises dining accounted for 73 percent of those (compared to 68 percent last year), as opposed to 27 percent interactions for dine-in. That continues, the company said, to support the headline the pandemic structurally changed consumer behavior\u201448 percent of respondents said ordering for delivery and/or takeout increased since 2019. Only 18 percent said it slid backward.\n\nBefore the pandemic, roughly 48 percent of respondents said their frequency of ordering delivery and takeout increased.\n\nThis quarter, the reported frequency of drive-thru interactions exceeded all other forms of dining, including takeout, in-person, and delivery. It\u2019s an observation that pulsed last survey as well. The why behind it, William Blair suggested, could be customers are headed to the lane to save on added costs. Pricing pressures, through delivery fees and otherwise, are leading diners to the drive-thru.\n\nPortillo\u2019s has realigned its GMs to focus on factors that matter when driving transactions and sales.\n\nPeople said they go to the drive-thru 3.3 days per month, surpassing in-person (2.9 days), takeout (2.7), and delivery (1.8).\n\nTracking another development, 70 percent of respondents said they were comfortable using in-store kiosks to order/pay for food in a restaurant. It signaled a notable rise from 53 percent who said the same in William Blair\u2019s previous survey (you could potentially thank the demographic shift for that as well). Nonetheless, the company said, it continues to believe kiosks could serve as a meaningful lever to drive more digital interactions over time\u2014and toward that higher check. One example: Yum! noted in Q3 that kiosk usage supported a 3-point climb in digital sales mix, which now totals more than 55 percent of the group\u2019s sales.\n\n\u201cThat said,\u201d William Blair added, \u201copen-ended respondent commentary continues to convey mixed sentiment among consumers; even of those respondents who are comfortable with kiosk usage, some still prefer human interaction. Regardless, results continue to indicate changing consumer behaviors, with increased comfort with digital channels like self-service kiosks and QR codes.\u201d\n\nWhile at a restaurant, 43 percent said they were not comfortable using QR codes over a mobile device in a restaurant, and when analyzing the data by age, only 33 percent under the age of 60 were not comfortable deploying QR codes in a restaurant setting, as opposed to 74 percent of respondents over the age of 60 who were not comfortable with QR codes.\n\n\u201cWhile some individuals continue to express preference for physical menus since the rapid proliferation of QR codes post-pandemic, respondents seem to be increasingly comfortable with the prevalence and functionality of these ordering channels,\u201d William Blair continued.\n\nThis quarter, the company also asked a new question around acceptance of service and credit charge surcharges\u2014an approach that\u2019s gained adoption for restaurants trying not to take additional price but needing to balance rising costs. Roughly 75 percent of respondents said they find these fees unreasonable. However, only 31 percent said they would avoid restaurants that administer them. Another 13 percent said fees were small/reasonable and 12 percent hadn\u2019t noticed them.\n\nThe most prevalent ordering method overall was directly through a restaurant\u2019s website or digital app\u201439 percent of respondents for takeout and 34 percent for delivery. This was the first quarter in William Blair\u2019s reports where these digital options overtook in-person and over-the-phone orders as the most popular method (used by about 37 percent of respondents for takeout and 21 percent for delivery). Third-party marketplaces followed, where usage was materially higher for delivery (33 percent of December orders) than takeout (12 percent). That, however, was an expected result.\n\nExcluding respondents over the age of 60, the percentage ordering in person or over the phone was 33 percent for takeout (down from 37 percent last quarter) and 15 percent for delivery (a decrease from 26 percent). When ordering for delivery, respondents under the age of 60 were more likely to order directly through a third-party marketplace (38 percent) or a restaurant\u2019s website/app (34 percent). \u201cWe continue to observe demographic shifts and expect growing comfort with digital channels will drive an ongoing mix-shift toward digital ordering by consumers,\u201d William Blair said.\n\nFor those going the takeout and delivery route, convenience and time constraints remained the top considerations, at 71 percent, followed by preference not to cook (28 percent).\n\nUsage of loyalty programs also surfaced as a vital trigger to traffic growth. It jumped notably from the last survey, with 63 percent of December respondents saying they actively participate in one\u2014a sizable lift from 55, 52, and 47 percent in September, June, and March, respectively.\n\nNearly 70 percent (69) of respondents under 60 reported using them. Additionally, 63 percent said loyalty platforms were either somewhat or highly influential in their decision of where to eat. That was a major hike from past surveys, too.\n\nThe proportion of consumers who said loyalty programs did not influence their decision on where to dine showed a continued and clear downward trend."

            "article_content": "Looking ahead: As we celebrate the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology this year, Keith Burnett says it can be a reminder of how the benefits of physics span over decades (courtesy: Schmidt Science Fellows)\n\nLast year was the year of elections and 2025 is going to be the year of decisions.\n\nAfter many countries, including the UK, Ireland and the US, went to the polls in 2024, the start of 2025 will see governments at the beginning of new terms, forced to respond swiftly to mounting economic, social, security, environmental and technological challenges.\n\nThese issues would be difficult to address at any given time, but today they come amid a turbulent geopolitical context. Governments are often judged against short milestones \u2013 the first 100 days or a first budget \u2013 but urgency should not come at the cost of thinking long-term, because the decisions over the next few months will shape outcomes for years, perhaps decades, to come. This is no less true for science than it is for health and social care, education or international relations.\n\nIn the UK, the first half of the year will be dominated by the government\u2019s spending review. Due in late spring, it could be one of the toughest political tests for UK science, as the implications of the tight spending plans announced in the October budget become clear. Decisions about departmental spending will have important implications for physics funding, from research to infrastructure, facilities and teaching.\n\nOne of the UK government\u2019s commitments is to establish 10-year funding cycles for key R&D activities \u2013 a policy that could be a positive improvement. Physics discoveries often take time to realise in full, but their transformational nature is indisputable. From fibre-optic communications to magnetic resonance imaging, physics has been indispensable to many of the world\u2019s most impactful and successful innovations.\n\nEmerging technologies, enabled by physicists\u2019 breakthroughs in fields such as materials science and quantum physics, promise to transform the way we live and work, and create new business opportunities and open up new markets. A clear, comprehensive and long-term vision for R&D would instil confidence among researchers and innovators, and long-term and sustainable R&D funding would enable people and disruptive ideas to flourish and drive tomorrow\u2019s breakthroughs.\n\nAlongside the spending review, we are also expecting the publication of the government\u2019s industrial strategy. The focus of the green paper published last year was an indication of how the strategy will place significance on science and technology in positioning the UK for economic growth.\n\nIf we don\u2019t recognise the need to fund more physicists, we will miss so many of the opportunities that lie ahead\n\nPhysics-based industries are a foundation stone for the UK economy and are highly productive, as highlighted by research commissioned by the Institute of Physics, which publishes Physics World. Across the UK, the physics sector generates \u00a3229bn gross value added, or 11% of total UK gross domestic product. It creates a collective turnover of \u00a3643bn, or \u00a31380bn when indirect and induced turnover is included.\n\nLabour productivity in physics-based businesses is also strong at \u00a384 300 per worker, per year. So, if physics is not at the heart of this effort, then the government\u2019s mission of economic revival is in danger of failing to get off the launch pad.\n\nA pivotal year\n\nAnother of the new government\u2019s policy priorities is the strategic defence review, which is expected to be published later this year. It could have huge implications for physics given its core role in many of the technologies that contribute to the UK\u2019s defence capabilities. The changing geopolitical landscape, and potential for strained relations between global powers, may well bring research security to the front of the national mind.\n\nIntellectual property, and scientific innovation, are some of the UK\u2019s greatest strengths and it is right to secure them. But physics discoveries in particular can be hampered by overzealous security measures. So much of the important work in our discipline comes from years of collaboration between researchers across the globe. Decisions about research security need to protect, not hamper, the future of UK physics research.\n\nThis year could also be pivotal for UK universities, as securing their financial stability and future will be one of the major challenges. Last year, the pressures faced by higher education institutions became apparent, with announcements of course closures, redundancies and restructures as a way of saving money. The rise in tuition fees has far from solved the problem, so we need to be prepared for more turbulence coming for the higher education sector. Read more Keith Burnett: IOP president says it is our duty to make physics more inclusive\n\nThese things matter enormously. We have heard that universities are facing a tough situation, and it\u2019s getting harder for physics departments to exist. But if we don\u2019t recognise the need to fund more physicists, we will miss so many of the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nAs we celebrate the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology that marks the centenary of the initial development of quantum mechanics by Werner Heisenberg, 2025 is a reminder of how the benefits of physics span over decades.\n\nWe need to enhance all the vital and exciting developments that are happening in physics departments. The country wants and needs a stronger scientific workforce \u2013 just think about all those individuals who studied physics and now work in industries that are defending the country \u2013 and that workforce will be strongly dependent on physics skills. So our priority is to make sure that physics departments keep doing world-leading research and preparing the next generation of physicists that they do so well."

            "article_content": "In September, Verseon, a pioneering company in physics- and AI-powered drug discovery, revealed that its AI technology significantly outperforms Google\u2019s cutting-edge Deep Learning models in terms of prediction accuracy for a wide range of datasets. Just a month later, the company announced a breakthrough in combining multiple AI models in dynamic ways. And most recently, they\u2019ve shown that their AI platform, VersAI\u2122, trains models 3,000 times faster than Google AutoML on standard benchmark datasets.\n\nSo, how are they pulling this off?\n\nThe answer lies in their proprietary VersAI\u2122 technology.\n\nUnlike most AI companies \u2013 which rely on off-the-shelf AI tools from giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI \u2013 Verseon has built its own proprietary AI technology from the ground up. These other companies primarily use Deep Learning frameworks that depend on vast amounts of high-quality training data to function properly. \u201cBig Data\u201d in the form of billions of web pages is available to train large language models, and in the form of millions of transactions for specific products to train models that make personalized shopping recommendations. But in most AI use cases, large, dense datasets like those are hard to come by.\n\nFor most real-world applications, the available datasets are small and sparse. This poses a significant challenge for traditional Deep Learning. Most AI companies today struggle to gather enough high-quality data to build reliable models for their intended applications.\n\nAs Guang-Bin Huang, a professor at NTU in Singapore and one of the lead authors of a landmark AI paper, points out, \u201cWhile deep learning excels in certain applications, it\u2019s not the best approach for small or sparse datasets. In these cases, its performance can be severely limited.\u201d\n\nVerseon, however, has developed an entirely new AI architecture that is specifically designed to handle small, sparse datasets \u2013 the kind that are common in many real-world applications, including drug discovery.\n\nWhat Makes VersAI\u2122 Different from Deep Learning?\n\nThe key difference lies in the neural network structure. In any AI system, the neural network is composed of input nodes (where data enters), hidden nodes (which process the data), and output nodes (where the results are produced).\n\nDeep Learning uses a monolithic neural network with multiple hidden layers to process data. The more complex the data, the more layers are required, and each additional layer adds significant computational overhead. As a result, training these models is slow and resource-intensive.\n\nVersAI\u2122, by contrast, takes a fundamentally different approach. As Verseon\u2019s Ed Ratner describes, \u201cUnlike Deep Learning AI, VersAI uses a completely novel and proprietary neural \u2018network of networks\u2019 architecture.\u201d Instead of using one large network with many layers, VersAI\u2122 uses multiple smaller, independent neural networks, each with a single hidden layer. These networks process the data in parallel, and then their outputs are dynamically weighted and combined to generate a final result. This method substantially reduces the error rate in predictions for small and sparse datasets. And it also consistently reduces model-training times regardless of the size or density of the training dataset.\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nDeep Learning models become dramatically more complicated and slower as the size and complexity of training data increase, leading to longer training times and consequent delays in building deployable models. In contrast, VersAI\u2019s 3,000 times faster training allows building models in near real time \u2013 a virtue critical in applications like ecommerce where trends can change fast.\n\nThis training time advantage also leads to much lower deployment costs. The reduced computational intensity of training models in VersAI\u2122 relative to Deep Learning not only requires less costly computer hardware, but it also uses far less electricity. In short, VersAI\u2122 is much greener AI.\n\nA Pharma Company Revolutionizing AI\n\nIt\u2019s truly remarkable that a pharmaceutical company is at the forefront of developing fundamental new AI technology that outperforms industry titans like Google, Meta, and OpenAI \u2013 particularly when it comes to handling the small, sparse datasets that are common in real-world applications. And the potential of VersAI\u2122 extends far beyond drug discovery. Given its impressive performance so far, this innovative technology could have a transformative impact on the reliability and effectiveness of AI across many consumer, science, and business applications, improving the way AI is used in our everyday lives."

            "article_content": "Since it was founded in 2014, India-based Postman has made a name for itself as one of the most popular platforms for building and using APIs, with 500,000 organizations now using the service. Like with so many other SaaS services, though, its valuation today is reportedly down from its $5.6 billion high in 2021. But the company is now jumping head-first into the AI space with the launch of an AI agent builder that combines large language models and the Postman API platform, as well as a visual editor that brings the two together to help even non-developers build and test AI agents.\n\nAt first, jumping into AI agents may seem like an odd choice for a company like Postman, but as Postman CEO and co-founder Abhinav Asthana noted when I talked to him ahead of the agent builder\u2019s launch, to be useful, these agents have to interact with a wide variety of services \u2014 and the way to do that is through APIs.\n\n\u201cOur customers actually started asking us about this. \u2018Okay, this agent thing is kind of coming up. What are you guys doing about it?\u2019 And we looked at the patterns in which they are stringing this together. Whether they\u2019re using homegrown systems or they\u2019re using some third-party stuff, APIs are a key part of it, because there are two kinds of APIs: one is the LLM itself, like the OpenAI API, or the Anthropic\u2019s API, or maybe a homegrown API. And the second bit are tools the agent would use. So we were like, okay, Postman is helping developers do all things APIs and if this is emerging as a pattern, we should do something here,\u201d explained Asthana.\n\nPostman agent workflows. Image Credits:Postman\n\nHe also noted that a growing number of Postman users are non-developers, who want to use the service for building simple, API-centric applications. \u201cSo when AI technology started emerging, we had to test it out a lot. We saw like, \u2018okay, can this be used?\u2019 And it looks like no-code, plus AI, plus agents is a good combo to bring together,\u201d Asthana said.\n\nPostman\u2019s API network already features an API hub with contributions from over 18,000 companies, which now, in turn, also allows its users to build AI agents that can interact with these APIs. To ensure that these agents work as expected, Postman is adding testing and evaluation tools to the service to test prompts and inputs for the models it supports (think OpenAI, Google\u2019s Gemini, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, Cohere, and Meta\u2019s Llama, for example). It then allows users to use Postman Flows, the company\u2019s visual development environment, to build these agents and have them interact with APIs.\n\nPostman LLM evaluation. Image Credits:Postman\n\nRight now, Postman\u2019s AI agents are mostly focused on enabling back-end operations. While developers could use the service to power front-end services, Postman itself doesn\u2019t offer any user interface for directly interacting with these agents yet. Over time, this may change. \u201cWe are all very bullish on agent software, but I think the modalities in which we interact with these systems is also going to evolve,\u201d Asthana said.\n\nPostman, of course, is not the only company in this space, but on top of having its existing API hub, Asthana also believes that it can differentiate its service from others \u2014 and especially the large cloud providers \u2014 by offering a better developer experience. \u201cIn my opinion, the cloud providers always prioritize consumption of the cloud over developer experience, and I think they\u2019re willing to partner with anyone who does actually give the right developer experience,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company is still figuring out how to best charge for this new service. Pricing, Asthana said, will evolve over time as the team works out how to best determine the value that these agents bring.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

            "article_content": "DeepSeek, a Chinese Artificial Intelligence startup, has launched a new model that it claims is on par with OpenAI-o1.\n\nIn a recently released paper, the startup noted that its new flagship AI model, R1, showed a new level of reasoning. It tweeted, \u201cDeepSeek-R1 is here. Performance on par with OpenAI-o1. Fully open-source model and technical report. MIT licensed: distill and commercialise freely.\u201d\n\nAccording to experts, this product is a huge leap in terms of scale and efficiency and may upend expectations of how much power and computing will be needed to manage the AI revolution, considering it was done on a cheaper budget than AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nRead also: Investment in GenAI to rise by 60% in 3 years\n\n\u201cDeepSeek R1 is 100 percent open source and 96.4 percent cheaper than OpenAI o1 while delivering similar performance. OpenAI o1: $60.00 per 1M output tokens DeepSeek R1: $2.19 per 1M output tokens,\u201d tweeted Shubham Saboo, a senior AI product manager in the US.\n\nArnaud Bertrand, founder of HouseTrip and Me & Qi, noted on X, \u201cIt\u2019s essentially as if someone had released a mobile on par with the iPhone but was selling it for $30 instead of $1000.\u201d\n\nAccording to DeepSeek, R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. Its research paper states that this is possible because of pure reinforcement learning. According to Jim Fan, senior research manager at Nvidia, this technique is why Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaZero is a master at games like Go and Chess from scratch.\n\nDeepSeek, launched in 2023, explained in its paper that its goal is to explore the potential of AI to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data. It noted that an earlier version of R1, called R1-Zero, gave it an \u201caha moment\u201d in which the AI \u201clearned to allocate more thinking time to a problem to reevaluating its initial approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are living in a timeline where a non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive \u2013 truly open, frontier research that empowers all. It makes no sense. The most entertaining outcome is the most likely,\u201d tweeted Jim Fan.\n\nHe noted that DeepSeek\u2019s R1 is not only an open source but also spills all the training secrets of AI models. Bertrand of Me & Qi explained that the open source nature of R1 will enable plenty of AI applications that were unaffordable before.\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cSay, for instance, that you want to build a service that helps people summarize books (random example). In AI parlance, the average book is roughly 120,000 tokens (since a \u201ctoken\u201d is about 3/4 of a word and the average book is roughly 90,000 words).\n\nRead also: Artificial Intelligence (AI) \u2013What impact will it have on education?\n\n\u201cAt OpenAI\u2019s prices, processing a single book would cost almost $2 since they charge $15 per 1 million tokens. DeepSeek\u2019s API, however, would cost only $0.07, which means your service can process about 30 books for $2 vs just 1 book with OpenAI: suddenly your book summarizing service is economically viable.\u201d\n\nHe noted that DeepSeek has changed the AI game. OpenAI began the AI race when it launched ChatGPT in November 2022. However, models from tech giants such as Google and Meta and those from across the world are catching up.\n\nShare"

Its goal is to enable models to generalize knowledge across different tasks, allowing them to learn new tasks more efficiently with minimal data. This process involves two main stages:\n\nMeta Training: In this stage, models learn from a variety of tasks.\n\nMeta Testing: Here, the model's ability to adapt to a new task is evaluated."

            "source": "The Conversation",
            "article_content": "The war in Gaza will leave its mark in many ways, long after the recently negotiated ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.\n\nOne legacy relates to how the chaos of war provides the perfect storm for the rise in antimicrobial resistance.\n\nThis is when microbes evolve to withstand the medicines designed to kill them. These microbes turn into superbugs, rendering previously effective treatments ineffective, and previously survivable infections, deadly.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen examples of antimicrobial resistance in Gaza and other conflict zones around the world.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance is a growing problem globally. It not only threatens human health, but also agriculture, food security and economies.\n\nManaging antimicrobial resistance is complex. It requires approaches including preventing infections in the first place, strategic limits on how antimicrobial agents are used, and robust health-care systems.\n\nIn conflict zones, the reverse is starkly evident.\n\nHealth-care systems are disrupted\n\nArmed conflicts devastate health-care infrastructure. Such conflicts often occur in places with limited resources to start with.\n\nHospitals and diagnostic laboratories are damaged or destroyed, and supplies are depleted. Health-care workers are killed or displaced.\n\nConflict zones are left with less-than-ideal diagnostic capabilities, treatment and care.\n\nThis makes preventing and controlling infections incredibly difficult.\n\nVaccination is disrupted too\n\nDisrupted vaccination programs can affect the development of antimicrobial resistance in a number of direct and indirect ways.\n\nFor instance, in conflict zones, less vaccination against bacterial disease leads to more infections, increasing the need for antibiotics, and the risk that antimicrobial resistance develops.\n\nLess vaccination against viral diseases can leave people in conflict zones vulnerable to those viral infections and in turn, secondary bacterial infections. This leads to antibiotic use as a preventive measure, or as treatment, promoting the development of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nAntibiotics are overused and misused\n\nWidespread injuries, infections, and poor hygiene in conflict zones are common. This leads to an over-reliance on antibiotics, especially those acting against the broadest range of bacteria.\n\nIdeally, broad-acting antibiotics would be used sparingly and after diagnostic tests. However, treatment is needed and diagnostic capabilities are compromised. So broad-acting antibiotics are used much more often, further promoting the development of resistance.\n\nFewer controls over who has access to antibiotics in war-torn regions is also a problem. Without prescriptions, professional oversight or diagnostic tests, antibiotics are used in ways that drive further resistance. This includes using them \u201cjust in case\u201d, using ones not effective for that infection or injury, or using them for too long, or not long enough.\n\nFor all these reasons, overuse and misuse of antibiotics, while often unavoidable, make it more likely for resistant microbes to arise and spread.\n\nWounds, infections, antibiotics\n\nArmed conflict leads to large numbers of traumatic injuries. As Chief Surgeon Sergiy Kosulnykov at Mechnikov Hospital in Dnipro, Ukraine said last year:\n\nEvery blast is an open wound, and every open wound is an infection.\n\nTreating these injuries requires antibiotics. However, in conflict zones, the infecting microbes are often ones resistant to multiple drugs. This is especially when those microbes are acquired on the battlefield, in field hospitals or in other high-risk environments. Once antimicrobial resistance has started, these circumstances makes it easier for microbes to become resistant to additional antibiotics.\n\nUnsanitary living conditions\n\nRefugee camps and shelters for displaced populations are often overcrowded and lack access to clean water and proper sanitation.\n\nSo infections and resistant microbes are more likely to occur and spread, worsening outbreaks and fostering the evolution and spread of resistant microbes.\n\nThe wider breakdown in water and sanitation infrastructure also fosters the spread of waterborne microbes, increasing the prevalence and spread of resistant microbes.\n\nLack of surveillance and monitoring\n\nEffective management of antimicrobial resistance depends on accurate diagnostic tests, and robust surveillance systems to track resistance patterns and inform treatment recommendations.\n\nConflict disrupts these systems, leaving authorities blind to emerging resistance trends. This disruption also delays the implementation of effective countermeasures.\n\nGlobal spread of resistant pathogens\n\nConflict generates a large pool of antimicrobial-resistant microbes that may infect or colonise many people, in and beyond the conflict zone. Movement of people in and out of the conflict zone contributes to this spread across borders.\n\nRefugees and displaced people often carry resistant microbes to regions with no or less prior exposure, contributing to the global spread of antimicrobial resistance.\n\nAcinetobacter baumanii bacteria that are highly resistant to multiple antibiotics are one example. These have proven problematic to treat in United States military personnel that returned with combat injuries from Afghanistan and Iraq. The same bacteria have been noted in the United Kingdom as a potential source of life-threatening infections that spread readily in hospitals.\n\nIn Afghanistan, Gaza, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen and elsewhere, bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics have emerged and thrived during conflicts, and continue to do so.\n\nWhat should we do about it?\n\nAntimicrobial resistance in regions affected by conflict requires urgent action, as well as peace. This includes rebuilding and maintaining health-care systems, improving sanitation, regulating antibiotic use, and ensuring access to clean water and vaccines.\n\nInternational cooperation and sustained investment are essential to mitigating the devastating impact on those already affected by conflict.\n\nWithout this, antimicrobial resistance becomes yet another catastrophic legacy of war, threatening human health and security for generations to come."

            "article_content": "Rupay Credit Card on UPI\n\nCustomers using RuPay credit cards linked to UPI do 40 transactions per month average, eight times higher than traditional credit card users, according to an analysis done by RuPay credit card fintech Kiwi.\n\nThe higher frequency helped RuPay corner a 12 percent market share for card transaction volume in 2024, compared to the three percent the payment network had in 2023, the Kiwi report said.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nBoth RuPay and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) are run by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). UPI is the country\u2019s most popular digital payment method cornering around 85 percent of all such transactions.\n\nRuPay is a domestic card network that competes with global giants Visa and Mastercard. Only RuPay cards are allowed to be linked to UPI as per the regulations.\n\nThe cumulative monthly transaction value of RuPay is around Rs 14,000 crore, while the overall credit card network value is around Rs 1.8 lakh crore, which translates into a 7.5 percent market share in value.\n\nAround two-thirds of all RuPay credit card transactions happen through UPI. A year ago, RuPay was doing around Rs 10,000 worth of transactions in a month, of which 50 percent came through UPI.\n\nWhile RuPay is the most successful debit card platform with more than 80 percent of the market share in cards issued, it trails Visa and Mastercard in credit cards, where the spending is much higher. However, with the linking of RuPay credit cards with UPI, the platform has now cornered a 25 percent market share in new credit cards issued in the country. There are around 10.5 crore active credit cards in the country as per the Reserve Bank of India data.\n\nHowever, RuPay network's popularity has been surging over the last year as customers get the best of credit card rewards with the convenience and reach of UPI. While there are only 9o lakh card-accepting merchants, there are an estimated 32 crore UPI merchants.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nRuPay credit card spending is growing at 5 percent monthly, reaching an average of Rs 40,000 per user, according to data available with Kiwi. The company, is one of the early adopters of enabling virtual RuPay credit cards (issued by Axis Bank and Yes Bank) that can be linked with their UPI accounts. Kiwi has raised a little less than $20 million until now and does around Rs 300 crore worth of transactions in a month.\n\nHowever, the average transaction value is Rs 1,100, much lower compared to Visa and Mastercard, where the average transaction value is around Rs 4,000. This is mostly because the cards are still mostly used for daily small-value payments, where the customers earlier used to pay with UPI.\n\n\u201cUPI-enabled credit cards are transforming how millions of Indians engage with credit, By combining the convenience and widespread acceptance of UPI with the power of credit, we are seeing a new wave of financial inclusion. This empowers individuals with more responsible, accessible, and transparent financial tools, driving a shift towards smarter spending habits and responsible credit usage,\u201d says Mohit Bedi, cofounder of Kiwi.\n\nThis surge is benefiting local retailers and small merchants, with 75 percent of transactions being conducted at grocery shops and other small businesses in the country.\n\nDue to a high merchant discount rate \u2013 or the commission that merchants pay to card issuing banks and payment providers \u2013 most small merchants are reluctant to accept credit cards. On the other hand, merchants using RuPay credit cards on UPI are charged fees only for transactions exceeding Rs 2,000, making them particularly attractive to small businesses that previously avoided credit cards. RuPay had also faced some resistance from merchants in the past.\n\nMost credit card users have more than one credit card and customers are increasingly opting for virtual RuPay credit cards as their second or third, with 50 percent of these cards being digital ones. They are also more popular with younger customers with around 45 percent of users in the under 30 age group, and another 30 percent of users between ages 31 and 40.\n\nThe rise of RuPay has been helped by the regulatory diktats. Last year, RBI mandated all card issuers (mostly banks) to offer consumers the option to choose their card network when applying for a new credit card or when renewing their credit cards. This ended the decades-old way of banks entering into exclusive agreements with Visa and Mastercard. In August, NPCI also directed banks to ensure RuPay credit cardholders receive rewards on par with other networks.\n\nRuPay\u2019s growing foothold in the domestic credit card market is particularly significant as geopolitical tensions highlight the importance of domestic payment systems. The recent exclusion of Russian payment systems from global networks like Visa and Mastercard has underscored the need for nations to develop independent solutions.\n\nNPCI is working with several countries to develop a similar domestic card network. It is also entering into bilateral partnerships with other countries that will enable international RuPay card payments without the help of other card networks."

Its products are currently available on Blinkit.\n\n\u201cCurrently, on Zepto, our Lenovo Tab M11 is the most purchased tablet and we\u2019re optimistic about scaling this channel further to enhance accessibility and convenience for our customers,\u201d said Dinesh Nair, Director of Consumer Business, Lenovo India.\n\nNew growth channel\n\nIndia\u2019s traditional PC market (inclusive of desktops, notebooks, and workstations) shipped an all-time high of 4.49 million units in the third quarter of calendar year 2024, up 0.1 percent year-over-year (YoY), amid the festival season last year, according to a report by the International Data Corporation (IDC).\n\nHP led the market with a share of 29 percent, followed by Lenovo and Dell Technologies with a market share of 17.3 percent and 14.6 percent, respectively. The Acer Group occupied the fourth spot at 14.6 percent again, with Asus rounding out the top five at 9.7 percent, the report showed.\n\nAs the country\u2019s PC market continues to grow, India's $5.5 billion quick commerce market is emerging as the next phase of online growth for many PC manufacturers.\n\n\u201cWe believe quick commerce is the future of e-commerce and offers us a new avenue to expand our reach and serve more customers,\u201d said Su.\n\nAccording to the Asus executive, traditional e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon have not been able to meet the growing need for faster deliveries, and quick commerce has emerged as a channel that can complement existing online platforms.\n\n\u201cWhile some may perceive quick commerce as a threat to established online players, we view it as an opportunity to reach a niche customer base in need of products beyond just daily groceries or FMCG items,\u201d he said.\n\nFor other OEMs, it is still early days and quick commerce is currently just another channel that they want to expand their presence to.\n\n\u201cAs a brand, our focus remains on serving our customers across all platforms\u2014whether it\u2019s through offline retail stores, online and e-commerce channels, or emerging quick commerce solutions. By embracing innovative distribution models, we are ensuring that our customers can access HP products wherever and whenever they need them,\u201d said HP\u2019s Gehani.\n\nEarly days for laptops on quick commerce\n\nWhether laptops take off in a big way via quick commerce remains to be seen. Analysts tracking the sector expect the category to make up a small share of quick commerce sales for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cIt will require considerable effort to scale the laptop and PC category on quick commerce. Sales in this category are expected to remain between 2-3 percent in the medium term,\u201d said an internet sector analyst.\n\nRegardless, PC makers are of the view that quick commerce players with strong execution will be able to drive sales, as demand for high-value electronics on quick commerce continues to rise.\n\n\u201cThis depends on how quick commerce players are going to solve the need for a larger selection for buyers along with the convenience of delivery in 10-30 minutes,\u201d said Goel."

            "article_content": "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are needed for businesses to have good control over key processes such as accounting, supply chain, manufacturing, HR and many more. In recent years, however, with the advent of cloud computing, businesses now have a choice to deploy ERP solutions on-premise or in the cloud.\n\nCloud and on-premise ERPs have vastly different integration capabilities and methods. In order to decide which integration approach would be better for a business, you need to consider factors like cost, scalability, data security and customizability.\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive comparison between cloud and on-premise ERP integrations across critical factors that technology decision-makers must consider before selecting an integration approach. It also offers advice on determining if your business is better suited for the cloud or on-premise ERP ecosystem based on your operating model, growth objectives and enterprise architecture.\n\nCloud ERP Integration Overview\n\nERP solutions for the cloud from ERP software development services can be hosted on vendor or third-party servers and accessed through the Internet. With this deployment model, businesses don\u2019t have to invest in on-premise hardware and ERP infrastructure.\n\nCloud ERP systems such as Oracle NetSuite, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, and Infor CloudSuite are more commonly built using modern API-led connectivity protocols rather than traditional on-premise approaches like batch data transfers or point-to-point integration.\n\nKey integration capabilities with cloud ERP deployments include:\n\nReal-time data sync between cloud ERP and other SaaS apps via APIs\n\nSimple app integration through cloud ERP marketplaces\n\nPrebuilt connectors to popular SaaS platforms like ecommerce, payments, marketing automation etc\n\nEDI and supply chain integration through cloud B2B networks\n\nIntegration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) for interfacing legacy on-premise systems\n\nAgility and Speed\n\nThe API-led architecture of cloud ERP systems integration accelerates the implementation of new apps and workflows to keep pace with business priorities. IT can build integrations in days/weeks rather than months with on-premise ERPs.\n\nLower TCO\n\nWith cloud ERP system integration, there is no need for upfront capital expenditure on integration software, hardware and middleware. Businesses only pay for used capacity as an operating expense.\n\nScalability\n\nYou can easily scale prebuilt and custom integrations to handle higher transaction loads as your ERP data integration volume grows without disruption. Usage-based pricing allows paying for only additional capacity.\n\nEnhanced Data Security\n\nCloud ERP vendors spend a lot of money on advanced security controls like encryption, tokenization, role-based access etc., and the integrations built using these systems also come with the same security capabilities.\n\nInnovation Velocity\n\nCloud ERP platforms are often updated, so their integration capabilities utilize the latest technologies, such as AI/ML, blockchain, advanced analytics, etc. On-premise systems do not provide these latest integration features.\n\nKey Challenges with Cloud ERP Integration\n\nWhile cloud ERP integrations accelerate digitization, some downsides need consideration:\n\nVendor dependence risk\n\nBusinesses become technologically wedded to the cloud ERP vendor. Migrating large data volumes across systems is challenging if the provider relationship turns sour later.\n\nCustomization constraints\n\nAlthough configuration is possible, custom-coding cloud ERPs like SAP S/4HANA Cloud are restricted. It limits bespoke modification of prebuilt integrations.\n\nIntegration costs add up\n\nWhile cloud ERP software integration needs lower initial investment, custom development and licensing connector apps in the marketplace incur ongoing costs.\n\nIntegration testing limitations\n\nCloud ERP vendors don\u2019t always fully simulate live production scenarios during integration ERP system testing, which can hinder the anticipation of post-go-live issues.\n\nCloud vendor technical support\n\nWhile some cloud ERP vendors provide prompt, expert technical support for complex integration issues and niche troubleshooting that requires troubleshooting skills, others don\u2019t.\n\nOn-Premise ERP Integration Overview\n\nSAP ECC, Oracle E-Business Suite, and Infor LN are ERP software installed on on-premises servers in the company system. The administration of the ERP platform and databases and the management of upgrades, security patches, and fixes are all the responsibilities of the IT team.\n\nLegacy B2B protocols like EDI and point-to-point middleware have historically dominated integration architectures for on-premise ERP deployments. However, modern integration tools like Boomi, MuleSoft and Microsoft BizTalk now empower API-based connectivity even with on-premise ERPs.\n\nHere are some of the prominent ERP integration methods with on-premise ERP platforms:\n\nEDI for B2B data interchange with supply chain partners\n\nPoint-to-point integration using middleware\n\nAPI connectivity to/from ERP using an integration platform (iPaaS)\n\nBatch data integration for periodic large data transfers\n\nOn-premise or hosted integration platform installations\n\nChange data capture for detecting and propagating updates\n\nEnterprise service buses (ESB) for routing integration traffic\n\nProcess integration with business process management (BPM) tools\n\nWhile cloud integration delivers agility, on-premise ERP integration brings other strategic advantages:\n\nCustomization Freedom\n\nOn-premise ERPs allow modifications to source code to enhance and tailor prebuilt integrations. They offer greater flexibility than cloud ERPs.\n\nBetter Legacy Connectivity\n\nOn-premise ERP software integration tools have well-established legacy protocol adapters that seamlessly interface with outdated systems. Thus, it is easier to retain legacy compatibility while upgrading an integrated ERP system.\n\nContinuity During Outages\n\nIntegration processes are minimally disrupted when the internet goes down as servers are inside the corporate firewall. The problem is that if externally hosted systems become unavailable, cloud integration workflows stop.\n\nStricter Data Security\n\nDirect control over servers without surrendering them to cloud vendors for stringent compliance and security reasons are some highly regulated industries such as defense and banking, etc.\n\nSuperior Support Mechanisms\n\nOn-premise ERP platforms allow easier leveraging of internal IT talent and external system integrators for technical support during complex integration issues. Resolution times are faster.\n\nKey Challenges with On-Premise ERP Integration\n\nHowever, businesses pay a steep price for the wide-ranging control and customizability delivered by on-premise ERP integration in certain areas:\n\nInflexible and slow\n\nDiplomatic protocols and point-to-point links between on-premise ERP and surrounding systems make agile integration challenging. Responding to changing needs involves prolonged development and testing cycles.\n\nSubstantial hardware demands\n\nMaintaining high-performance infrastructure for integration middleware, databases, backup systems etc., drives up capital expenditure costs with on-premise ERP integration.\n\nScaling limitations\n\nPhysical capacity in the on-premise data center constricts the addition of integration infrastructure to handle higher transaction volumes during business growth.\n\nVendor dependence\n\nWhile customization is possible, skilled resources for legacy ERP platforms like SAP ECC are dwindling. This compels businesses to pay premiums for vendor consulting.\n\nWaning innovation\n\nVendors are focused on developing their cloud ERP offerings. As a result, fewer cutting-edge features reach on-premise product versions through upgrades, causing integration capabilities to lag.\n\nMaking the Right Choice: Cloud vs On-Premise ERP Integration\n\nWhile both cloud and on-premise ERP integration models have trade-offs, the right choice depends on your business priorities and IT landscape:\n\nTransaction volume \u2013 High-volume integration needs may require on-premise for optimal performance\n\nHigh-volume integration needs may require on-premise for optimal performance Budget \u2013 Cloud integration with pay-per-usage may suit mid-market firms reluctant to large upfront investment\n\nCloud integration with pay-per-usage may suit mid-market firms reluctant to large upfront investment Agility needs \u2013 Frequently changing integration needs favor cloud ERPs for swift reconfiguration\n\nFrequently changing integration needs favor cloud ERPs for swift reconfiguration Compliance needs \u2013 Heavily regulated industries may prefer on-premise for localized security control\n\nHeavily regulated industries may prefer on-premise for localized security control Legacy landscape \u2013 Lots of outdated surround systems prefer on-premise integration with better legacy bridges\n\nLots of outdated surround systems prefer on-premise integration with better legacy bridges Innovation culture \u2013 Businesses that reward innovation gravitate towards cloud ERP\u2019s latest integration features\n\nBusinesses that reward innovation gravitate towards cloud ERP\u2019s latest integration features Application landscape \u2013 A predominantly cloud-based application portfolio suits cloud ERP integration, while on-premise apps align with on-premise ERP integrations\n\nIn addition, if an organization has a long-term hybrid enterprise architecture strategy, it can use both cloud and on-premise integration models at the same time.\n\nFor example, you can keep legacy on-premise ERP integration and cloud ERP integration with new SaaS capabilities. It allows you to pivot from existing systems to becoming cloud native at a sensible pace, keeping the critical operations running.\n\nThe bimodal integration architecture will align business IT objectives in terms of agility, innovation and risk mitigation.\n\nConclusion\n\nCloud ERP integration addresses serious challenges like inflexibility, upgrade headaches, and high total cost of ownership of legacy on-premise ERP platforms, albeit with its limitations: vendor dependency and customization constraints.\n\nWhile cloud ERP integration has compelling advantages for most modernizing enterprises, it deserves a careful analysis of your integration needs, IT ecosystem, business priorities and target operating model before you leap.\n\nAs cloud ERP adoption picks up sharply through 2025, the selection of integration technology now represents a watershed moment for the right digital transformation and innovation cadence.\n\nAfter methodically weighing the pros and cons of available integration approaches, choose wisely when to go with one, and then avoid modernization journeys that are completely misaligned and can seriously impede what you are trying to achieve with modernization."

            "article_content": "Theology is the study of our Triune God, His character, His actions in the universe, and His activities related to humankind. Reformed Theology stems from the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation, which served to counter the then-dominant Roman Catholic view of Theology.\n\nWhat are the Core Beliefs of Reformed Theology?\n\nReformed Theology is at the core of the Protestant Reformation. In its most basic and central structure, Reformed Theology is a picture of unity in diversity, with the Five Solas laying the foundation for the five points of Calvinism.\n\nThe core beliefs of Reformed Theology center on the aforementioned Five Solas of salvation\u2014Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone), Sola Gratia (Grace alone), Solus Christus (Christ alone), Sola Fide (Faith alone), and Soli Deo Gloria (the glory of God alone). Salvation comes by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone, according to Scripture alone for the glory of God alone. Important distinctions of Reformed Theology state Scripture is our ultimate authority in all things pertaining to life and godliness and God\u2019s absolute sovereignty over all things.\n\nTo get even more specific, Reformed Theology has the following core beliefs which stem from the five solas. In these core beliefs, those who hold to reformed theology differ from adherents of Catholicism, Lutheranism, or Arminianism, and show the lasting legacy of Protestant reformers like Martin Luther and John Calvin.\n\nReformed Theology's Belief in Predestination\n\nReformed Theology believes our final end, whether heaven or hell, is determined solely and sovereignly by the Lord God, and not only before we get there, but before we are born. Other faiths believe man has a role in where he ends up after his time on earth is done. Predestination holds the firm belief that God is all the Bible declares Him to be, which is merciful, holy, gracious, and just, etc. Whether He decrees a person saved or not, God is glorified wherever that person ends up.\n\nScripture: Proverbs 16:4; John 13:18; Romans 8:30; Ephesians 1:3-14\n\nReformed Theology's Belief in the Atonement\n\nReformed Theology believes Christ\u2019s death on the cross is the atonement necessary to save people from God\u2019s wrath. Sinful man cannot save himself; he needs a perfect, sinless Savior to save him. Through Adam, sin came to all humanity, Jesus, as the Last Adam, brought spiritual life to all who come to Him in repentance and faith and surrender to Him as Savior and Lord. Because God is sovereign and because of His plan of predestination, the salvation of the elect is sure (hence their assurance of salvation).\n\nScripture: Romans 3:21-28; Romans 5:17-19; 1 Corinthians 15:45; Matthew 1:21; John 3:16; John 17:9-12; Romans 8:30\n\nReformed Theology's Belief about the Role of Free Will in Salvation\n\nDr. R.C. Sproul said the \u201cvery essence of free will [is] to choose according to our desires.\u201d But as regards salvation, because we are fallen beings, we would choose our own way apart from God. That is the question: what causes man to choose to follow Christ? The great eighteenth-century pastor, Jonathan Edwards, said, \u201cas fallen human beings we retain our natural freedom (to act on our own wishes) but lose moral freedom (our inclination toward righteousness). God must change our hearts for us to choose Him. God draws the elect to Himself through the Lord Jesus Christ.\"\n\nScripture: Deuteronomy 30:19-20; John 6:44; John 15:5; Romans 8:5-8\n\nReformed Theology's Belief about Baptism\n\nReformed theology holds that baptism is an ordinance mandated by Christ as a symbol of our alliance with Him, His death, burial, and resurrection/ Baptism is not what saves us, but rather a picture of what Christ has already done in our lives and hearts.\n\nScripture: Romans 4:11-12; 1 Corinthians 12:12-14; Titus 3:3-7\n\nReformed Theology's Belief about Communion\n\nReformed theology believes communion is the second ordinance Christ directed the church to observe regularly. Communion is what we call the Lord\u2019s Supper, where we proclaim His death and life in remembrance of what He did for us \u201cuntil He comes again.\u201d\n\nScripture: Luke 22:19; 1 Corinthians 11:23-29\n\nReformed Theology's Belief in the Triunity of God\n\nGod is One and he is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, according to Reformed belief. The Godhead is comprised of three persons with one essence. This triune nature of God will remain a mystery to our finite minds, yet it is true according to God\u2019s Word.\n\nScripture: Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 3:16-17; 1 Peter 1:2\n\nReformed Theology's Belief in the Deity of Christ\n\nJesus Christ is God, and He is fully God and fully man, according to Reformed belief.\n\nScripture: Mark 2:28; John 1;1-14; Philippians 2:9-11; Colossians 1:19\n\nReformed Theology's View on Faith\n\nOur faith is rooted in the truth of the infallible Scriptures and salvation is through faith in Christ's atoning work.\n\nScripture: Romans 1:16-32; Romans 5:1-11; Galatians 3:1-14; Ephesians 2:8-9\n\nReformed Theology's Belief about the Church\n\nThe church is all the people who belong to the Lord\u2014the Bride of Christ\u2014God\u2019s elect, according to this theology.\n\nScripture: Matthew 13:24-43; 1 Corinthians 12: 12-14; Revelation 7:9-10\n\nReformed Theology's Views about the End Times\n\nReformed theology believes in the \u201cit-can-happen-at-any-moment\u201d rapture of the church, when believers will join Christ as he returns and be part of His triumphal procession. The invisible kingdom of God is here on earth in Christ's Body, the church; it will be physically revealed at Christ\u2019s return when He will reign as the true king.\n\nScriptures: Psalm 10:16-18; Daniel 2:44; John 18:36; Hebrews 1:8-14; Matthew 24: 1-25:46; Luke 21: 5-36; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-5:11\n\nIs Calvinism Part of Reformed Theology?\n\nIn short, yes. An important arm of Reformed Theology is Calvinism, named after its developer, John Calvin, a Swiss Reformer. Its basic tenets are comprised of five points, commonly known through the acronym, TULIP which is explained below.\n\nTotal depravity: because of the Fall (Genesis 3), humanity cannot save themselves and are blind, deaf, and dead to the Lord God. Man has no free will.\n\nUnconditional election: God chooses people based on His will alone, and not on any person\u2019s worth.\n\nLimited atonement: Jesus died only for the people God has chosen (the elect).\n\nIrresistible grace: God will sovereignly give His elect the gift of faith (salvation).\n\nPerseverance of the saints: No one saved by Jesus will ever lose their salvation (Once saved, always saved).\n\nHow Does Covenant Theology Relate to Reformed Theology?\n\nReformed Theology argues that covenant is central to Scripture\u2019s organization, and God\u2019s redemptive plan is organized around His covenants with humanity with Christ central to all. Reformed Theology is, in effect, Covenant Theology, and all covenants are culminated and encompassed in Christ. The biblical covenants are:\n\nThe Adamic Covenant (works) \u2013 Genesis 3 : This covenant established the terms of obedience for Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, where their disobedience brought sin and death into the world, initiating humanity's need for redemption.\n\n: This covenant established the terms of obedience for Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, where their disobedience brought sin and death into the world, initiating humanity's need for redemption. The Covenant of Grace (Genesis 3:15) : The overarching promise of salvation through a Redeemer, first introduced after the Fall, in which God pledged to defeat evil through the offspring of the woman, ultimately fulfilled in Christ.\n\n: The overarching promise of salvation through a Redeemer, first introduced after the Fall, in which God pledged to defeat evil through the offspring of the woman, ultimately fulfilled in Christ. The Noahic Covenant (Genesis 6:18) : God's promise to Noah after the flood, where He vowed never to destroy the earth by flood again, symbolized by the rainbow, ensuring the continuation of life and the stability of creation.\n\n: God's promise to Noah after the flood, where He vowed never to destroy the earth by flood again, symbolized by the rainbow, ensuring the continuation of life and the stability of creation. The Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 12:1-3; 15) : God's promise to Abraham that He would make him the father of many nations, bless his descendants, and give them the land of Canaan, ultimately pointing toward the coming of the Messiah.\n\n: God's promise to Abraham that He would make him the father of many nations, bless his descendants, and give them the land of Canaan, ultimately pointing toward the coming of the Messiah. The Mosaic Covenant (Exodus 19:4-6; 20:2) : The covenant in which God gave the Law to Israel through Moses, establishing a special relationship with them as His chosen people and setting the moral, civil, and ceremonial laws for their conduct.\n\n: The covenant in which God gave the Law to Israel through Moses, establishing a special relationship with them as His chosen people and setting the moral, civil, and ceremonial laws for their conduct. The Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7; 1 Chronicles 17) : God's promise to David that his lineage would produce an eternal kingdom, ultimately fulfilled in the reign of Jesus Christ, the Messiah.\n\n: God's promise to David that his lineage would produce an eternal kingdom, ultimately fulfilled in the reign of Jesus Christ, the Messiah. The New Covenant in Christ (The New Testament): The culmination of all previous covenants, where Christ's death and resurrection secured eternal redemption for believers, fulfilling the law and providing a new relationship with God through grace.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Historical Background of Reformed Theology?\n\nMartin Luther and John Calvin are the two most famous men of the Protestant Reformation, and we will center our look at the historical background of Reformed Theology on these two, with a mention of the other important figures in furthering Reformation Theology.\n\nGerman monk Martin Luther sparked the Reformation in 1517 when he posted his 95 Theses on the door of the Wittenberg Chapel, wherein he listed his findings from deep biblical study and prayer. His beliefs were based solely on his discoveries from the Bible, and they opposed the Catholic theology which melded the Bible with tradition. His theses also negated the pope\u2019s autonomy.\n\nLuther\u2019s public profession of faith departed from the Catholic doctrines, and of course raised their ire. He defended himself and, at the end, was excommunicated as a heretic by Pope Cajetan at the Diet of Worms (a Diet was a formal assembly with the goal of oratory and making determinations). At this 1521 event, Luther stood his ground against the Catholic church council and made his famous reply to their demand he recant of his public professions, \u201cUnless I am convinced by the testimony of Scripture or by clear reason, for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves, I am bound by the Scriptures that I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. I cannot do otherwise. Here I stand, God help me.\u201d\n\nEven in exile from the Catholic church, Luther continued his work and translated the Bible into the German language (a task he finally completed in 1534). Martin Luther died in 1546, but his Reformation legacy includes bringing forth part of the Five Solas of the Reformation with the other Reformers; he coined the term Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone), which is the bedrock for the Reformation doctrines.\n\nJohn Calvin was a Swiss Reformer and is considered by many to be the greatest of the Protestant theologians. In 1532, Calvin started a Protestant movement in France (where he was born). One year later, the Catholic church labeled Calvin a heretic and he fled Paris. Calvin went on to write his most famous and enduring apologetic for the faith, Institutes of the Christian Religion (1536), which explains Protestant beliefs.\n\nCalvin brought prominence to belief in the all-inclusive sovereignty of God and in the doctrine of predestination. His theological approach has been labeled \u201cCalvinism,\u201d a powerful theology embraced by an estimated eighty million Reformed Christians.\n\nWhat are Other Key Figures in Reformation History?\n\nJohn Wycliffe, an English priest who, in the fourteenth century, proposed limits to the pope\u2019s taxation policies and his civil powers. He challenged the Catholic belief of transubstantiation and believed Scripture should be available to the \u201ccommon folk.\u201d Followers of his later published the Wycliffe Bible, the first English Bible translation. Condemned by the Council of Constance of 267 heretical acts, Wycliffe died of complications from strokes; the Catholic church ordered his remains be unearthed, burned, and scattered on the river.\n\nJan Hus of Bohemia spread Wycliffe\u2019s ideas through a published paper. He refused to recant his stated beliefs and was burned at the stake.\n\nIn 1456, Johannes Gutenberg printed the first Bible in Europe (the Latin Vulgate) using moveable metallic type.\n\n\n\nWilliam Tyndale taught Scripture and is labeled a heretic by the Catholic council; his plans to print the New Testament in English, but upon discovery escapes with only a few sections completed, which he later finished in Germany. Tyndale was later imprisoned and then strangled and burned at the stake for heresy.\n\nWhat Influence Has Reformed Theology Had on Modern Christianity?\n\nReformed Theology places its emphasis firmly on Christ and His Word. The reformers stood against tradition, doctrinal errors, and an imposition of man\u2019s authority superseding God\u2019s. Hebrews 12:1 exhorts us to regard those who have gone before, from God\u2019s ancient prophets to the disciples and Apostles, and through the faithful men of the Reformation who exalted Christ, many at the cost of their lives.\n\nMost importantly, Reformed Theology looks to Christ, the Founder and Perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:2)\u2014to what Christ has done, what He is doing now, and forward to what He will do. People who adhere to a Reformed Theology see Christ at the center of redemptive history and live accordingly, seeking to love Him and obey Him in all they do.\n\nReformed churches are unified in their stance that Christ and His Word define and govern their teaching and preaching. Worship encompasses all parts of life, not just Sunday praise and fellowship. Reformed churches tend toward more Bible studies, community groups, and evangelism outreaches.\n\nBecause Reformed Theology churches are secure in their salvation, Pastor Edwin Hurley states, \u201cRather than trying to earn our salvation or justify ourselves, we live lives of grateful service because of what Christ has done for us.\u201d Reformed churches come together with open Bibles and hearts, eager to hear what the Lord will teach through the pastor. The congregations are likened to the Bereans noted in Acts 17:11, who, \u201creceived the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.\u201d What a noble and worthy endeavor for us to follow after.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWhat is TULIP in Calvinism?\n\nWhat are the Five Points of Calvinism?\n\n5 Things All Christians Should Understand about Reformed Theology\n\nPhoto credit: Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain\n\nLisa Loraine Baker is the multiple award-winning author of Someplace to be Somebody.

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nOver a span of several days last week, multiple sightings of UFOs were made in the Fresno, California area with no explanation ever revealed. A couple of the UFO sightings were even reported to the local airport tower by pilots.\n\nThe first UFO sighting occurred early in the morning when a light was recorded in the sky by a news tower camera just after 4 a.m. Fox 26 News reported that \u201cthe light appeared to hover over downtown Fresno.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you see that object move at the clip it moves and it\u2019s hovering again,\u201d said Earl Grey Anderson from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), who reviewed the footage. \u201cThat one I would probably actually give an unknown classification to which is a UFO.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat I thought was very interesting about the second video is the clip. It suddenly moves. I\u2019m not sure what distance we\u2019re looking at there. It wasn\u2019t light speed or anything like that but that was awfully fast. You\u2019ve got an interesting capture there somebody saw what I would technically call a UFO.\u201d\n\nThe day after the initial UFO sighting, Fox 26 News photojournalist Anthony Guevara captured video of another UFO in the time, this time in broad daylight.\n\nThree days later, during the afternoon, a private pilot radioed the Fresno airport tower with a report of something unidentified in the sky. A second pilot reported an object following him at 3,500 feet.\n\nTower: \u201cYou saw something over downtown at 3,500?\u201d Pilot: \u201cCorrect. It looked like a white object.\u201d Tower: \u201cHow long was this?\u201d Pilot: \u201cI just lost it right now.\u201d\n\nSeveral other people in the area also reported taking video of similar objects in the sky at the time. Jeanette Herrera of Fresno reported seeing it on back-to-back days, and it\u2019s not the first time she has seen UFOs over the city.\n\n\u201cI saw that one video of the orb and I was like\u2026 well, wait a second. I\u2019ve got good video of these things,\u201d said Herrera.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve filmed that particular orb at least three or four times in the last two weeks,\u201d Herrera continued, \u201cIt almost does this like firework thing where it blows up and then reappears in a different area. So, it just does that constantly and then sometimes it won\u2019t. It\u2019ll just stay like a little solid looking orb.\u201d\n\nA Fresno police helicopter, which investigated the one of the pilot\u2019s reports, and efforts to reach the Federal Aviation Administration in Fresno both proved fruitless for providing an explanation for the mysterious UFO sightings."

However, certain diseases and medical conditions continue to receive less funding and attention compared to others.\n\nPatients with rare medical conditions and diseases are often part of a traditionally underserved population. However, \u201corphan drugs\u201d provide hope by offering treatment options that improve their quality of life and potentially extend life expectancy.\n\nImage Credit: unoL/Shutterstock.com\n\nWhat is an Orphan Drug?\n\n\u201cOrphan\u201d diseases affect small patient populations. In the US, to be considered an orphan disease, it must affect under 200,000 patients. Typically, funding for treatment can be difficult to come by, with only 600 \u201corphan\u201d drugs approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).1\n\nThe term\u2019s origin can be found in the 1960s when Dr Harry Shirkey wrote an article called \u201cTherapeutic Orphans.\u201d Changes in legislation and regulation in that decade led to some drugs being \u201corphaned\u201d as they were no longer cost-effective for drug companies due to a lack of market demand. Thus, there has historically been little financial incentive for pharma companies to develop drugs to treat rare diseases.2\n\nMarket Report 2025: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing\n\nUnderstanding Rare Diseases\n\nWhilst a rare disease is defined as affecting under 200,000 patients in the US, the global patient population living with these types of disease is estimated at 3.5-5.9%. This is in the range of 263 to 446 million people worldwide.3\n\nRare diseases include well-known types of diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis, ALS, and hemophilia, as well as rarer types of cancers.\n\nMetabolism disorders, autoimmune diseases, autoinflammatory syndromes, cerebrovascular disorders, degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (a prion disease) all fall under the umbrella of rare diseases.\n\nThere are over 10,000 known medical diseases with a significant cumulative burden. Not only patients are affected, but family members and communities can feel the impact of these rare and hard-to-treat conditions.\n\n5 Myths About Orphan Drugs and the Orphan Drug Act Play\n\nThe Role of Orphan Drug Legislation\n\nAs explained above, the rarer a disease is, the less financial incentive there is for pharma companies to research and develop a drug to treat it. However, whether there is any financial incentive or not, patients still suffer the effects of these diseases.\n\nThe role of legislation has been critical for the development of drugs for these diseases. It would be the drafting of legislation such as the Orphan Drug Act (1983) in the US and the EU Regulation on orphan medicinal products that would make it easier for orphan drugs to come to market.4,5\n\nThe Orphan Drug Act (1983) incentivizes the development of orphan drugs by providing tax incentives, research subsidies, and exclusive marketing rights for companies for 7 years once an orphan drug comes to market. Since the act was introduced, over 880 orphan drugs have been approved for use by the FDA.4 Similarly, in the EU, over 200 orphan drugs have been authorized due to legislation.\n\nWhy are Orphan Drugs Important?\n\nAs can be seen, orphan drugs have been historically critically underfunded, and in some cases, even today, they can face financial pressures that limit their release onto the market. However, at the foundation of orphan drug research can be found the patients themselves and their unmet medical needs.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the inequalities and disparities across different patient populations and demographics, and this has parallels in the rare disease sector.\n\nThe UN has now recognized the importance of addressing these disparities, promoting greater integration of rare and orphan diseases into policies.3 The goals of rare disease research and universal health coverage targets share a commonality.\n\nOrphan drugs do not just improve the lives of those suffering from rare diseases, as mentioned previously in this article. Better funding and improved access to therapies also impact the families and communities of patients.\n\nThese drugs bring social and economic benefits; for example, relieving the symptoms of a rare disease can reduce care needs and burdens on family members.\n\nFurthermore, orphan drugs drive advancements in precision medicine and biotechnology. Innovation in this area can have a positive impact on related biomedical fields.\n\nChallenges in Developing Orphan Drugs\n\nThere are still several challenges with orphan drugs, although bringing them to market has been made easier by legislation.\n\nHigh development costs, limited financial returns, difficulty in conducting trials due to small patient populations, and the high price of orphan drugs are all roadblocks to their market adoption.\n\nHigh costs create access issues for patients and healthcare providers. Moreover, insurance companies may be less willing to cover the costs of orphan drugs due to the high costs and perceived lack of financial return associated with them.\n\nDrug Delivery: An Overview\n\nRecent Advances and Success Stories\n\nSince the introduction of legislation such as the Orphan Drug Act, there have been several success stories in the orphan drug and rare disease sector.\n\nIvalfactor and Kalydeco are drugs that treat Cystic Fibrosis, a debilitating condition that affects nearly 200,000 people worldwide. Spinraza is an orphan drug used to treat spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nCoagulation factor IX has been developed to prevent bleeding in hemophilia B patients. Rucaparib is a drug that was approved for ovarian cancer. Porphyria can be treated using Haem arginate.\n\nInnovations such as targeted therapies and gene therapy are accelerating research into rare diseases and orphan drugs. Personalized medicine is having an impact on areas such as orphan drug designation and pricing strategies.6\n\nThe Future of Orphan Drugs\n\nThe need for orphan drugs and therapeutics options for traditionally underserved patient populations has driven legislation and cooperation between governments, pharma companies, and patient advocacy groups in recent years.\n\nThis is likely to continue over the coming years and will continue to impact health outcomes for millions of patients worldwide.\n\nFurthermore, innovations in areas such as AI-powered drug discovery, machine learning, synthetic biology, and genomics are accelerating orphan drug development.\n\nThe emerging role of AI, for instance, is a pivotal moment in pharmaceutical research, improving the speed of drug target discovery exponentially. Novel molecules can be designed, and patient response markers can be better identified.\n\nSynthetic biology can help target identification. Novel biopharmaceuticals can be designed using these innovations. This can only benefit the development of orphan drugs for rare disease treatment in the future.\n\nIn Summary\n\nMillions of patients worldwide suffer from rare diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cancers, neurological disorders, and autoimmune diseases.\n\nOrphan drugs offer hope to these historically underserved patient populations, but a lack of funding and research focus makes releasing them to market problematic.\n\nHowever, legislation, innovation, and increasing collaboration between multiple stakeholders, including patient advocacy groups, have resulted in more orphan drugs being approved in recent years, improving patients' quality of life and health outcomes.\n\nFurther innovation and continued focus on advocacy for orphan drugs will be necessary to build on this global medical success story.\n\nReferencing\n\nChao, S (2024) What is an Orphan Drug?
