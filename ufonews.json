Junior\n\nMystery shrouds the skies over Belfast: what\u2019s going on?\n\nSo far this year, there have been three official reports of Unidentified Flying Object sightings (UFO) in the Greater Belfast area.\n\nThe first sighting of the year was in February, when a resident of Crumlin contacted the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) to report an object seen on January 29 with eight to ten lights around its perimeter.\n\nThe second incident occurred in the autumn, within Belfast\u2019s urban area. On October 18, a witness described a UFO leaving a vapour trail, not entirely silent, as it flew over their house and towards the docks.\n\nThe third sighting was reported on October 27 by a resident of Newtownabbey. According to the report, his wife first spotted the UFO through her camera in May and has seen it every night since. They described it as a bright light with holes on its underside.\n\nThe PSNI stated that all three reports this year were \u201cnoted for police information,\u201d without indicating that any investigations had been conducted into the sightings.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence closed its UFO desk\n\nThe number of reports has fluctuated since 2009, when the government\u2019s UFO project was cancelled, citing that in over 50 years, none of the reports received had posed a threat.\n\nWhile the police officially recorded three reports this year, it is likely that more sightings go unreported due to fears of not being taken seriously.\n\nWhat is really crossing the skies over Belfast?\n\nRead more news about Ireland\n\nExplore the latest European stories"

            "article_content": "Copilot+ PCs are the first PCs to run Small Language Models (SLM) on-device. It means these AI models are powered by local processing capabilities rather than relying on cloud, which is typically done by AIs like ChatGPT. This approach can result in faster responses as compared to the cloud-based Copilot or ChatGPT.\n\nNow, Microsoft has introduced AI Dev Gallery, which makes it easy to add on-device AI features to any app.\n\nThe AI Dev Gallery app is for developers who want to try multiple models to integrate an AI feature into their app. AI Dev Gallery has over 25 samples to download and run on Windows 10. Moreover, you can export the project or source code directly into your app and get it working instantly.\n\nIt works with Windows 10 and 11 and supports x64 and ARM64 architectures.\n\nOut of curiosity, Windows Latest cloned the AI Dev Gallery from its GitHub repository and compiled our own version of AI Dev Gallery.\n\nCurrently, the only way to access it is by building the project in Visual Studio and then running it. In addition, you\u2019ll need at least 20GB of space and a multi-core CPU. It also suggests a GPU with 8GB VRAM, but those are for heavy models only.\n\nWe started with a 4-core CPU, 4GB RAM, or a Windows 11 PC. The app has two modes: Sample and models. We used the sample view to check out all the available models.\n\nThe app categorizes them into Text, Image, Code, Audio and video, and Smart Controls.\n\nTesting the models\n\nModels for image generation and video generation need about 5GB of bandwidth to download and save it to your PC. To better understand how things work, we started with a small one related to image upscaling, which was under 100 MB.\n\nWe took a screenshot of the screen and tried to upscale it using the CPU. Note that you can switch between CPU and GPU for processing the request.\n\nThe upscaling happened in under 30 seconds in this inferior virtual machine, where the RAM usage increased to 1GB. As you can see in the screenshots below, App Gallery produced an upscaled version of the image with a 9272*4900 resolution.\n\nHowever, the 100MB upscale model has its own issues. While it used our local resources to upscale images, elements, especially text, were ruined. You can barely read the texts.\n\nThere\u2019s no option to preview this generated image in a bigger window or full-screen. Even the download option isn\u2019t there to save it to disk.\n\nWe tried another model called Detect Human Pose. It identifies someone\u2019s position in an image. While it accurately identified a basic walking person, it even started showing position marks for screenshots of our desktop with a few apps open.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how these models can be integrated into the app, but some of these features can be run locally. Of course, PCs will need bigger storage for these models and powerful CPUs with 16GB or more RAM.\n\nWhat do you think? It is worth downloading a 5GB model to convert a text prompt into an image or wait for 30 seconds to do that on a web app. Clearly, most of these features have very niche use cases and implementation environments rather than appealing to the whole Windows 11 user base."

            "article_content": "It's been a wild year in tech thanks to the intersection between humans and artificial intelligence. 2024 brought a parade of AI oddities, mishaps, and wacky moments that inspired odd behavior from both machines and man. From AI-generated rat genitals to search engines telling people to eat rocks, this year proved that AI has been having a weird impact on the world.\n\nWhy the weirdness? If we had to guess, it may be due to the novelty of it all. Generative AI and applications built upon Transformer-based AI models are still so new that people are throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. People have been struggling to grasp both the implications and potential applications of the new technology. Riding along with the hype, different types of AI that may end up being ill-advised, such as automated military targeting systems, have also been introduced.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that aside from crazy news, we saw fewer weird AI advances in 2024 as well. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet launched in June held off the competition as a top model for most of the year, while OpenAI's o1 used runtime compute to expand GPT-4o's capabilities with simulated reasoning. Advanced Voice Mode and NotebookLM also emerged as novel applications of AI tech, and the year saw the rise of more capable music synthesis models and also better AI video generators, including several from China.\n\nBut for now, let's get down to the weirdness.\n\nChatGPT goes insane\n\nCredit: Benj Edwards / Getty Images\n\nEarly in the year, things got off to an exciting start when OpenAI's ChatGPT experienced a significant technical malfunction that caused the AI model to generate increasingly incoherent responses, prompting users on Reddit to describe the system as \"having a stroke\" or \"going insane.\" During the glitch, ChatGPT's responses would begin normally but then deteriorate into nonsensical text, sometimes mimicking Shakespearean language.\n\nOpenAI later revealed that a bug in how the model processed language caused it to select the wrong words during text generation, leading to nonsense outputs (basically the text version of what we at Ars now call \"jabberwockies\"). The company fixed the issue within 24 hours, but the incident led to frustrations about the black box nature of commercial AI systems and users' tendency to anthropomorphize AI behavior when it malfunctions."

Credit: Schmidt Ocean Institute / YouTube\n\nAn age of discovery is upon us.\n\nEarth is an ocean planet, with over 70 percent of its surface covered in seas. With deep-sea robots, scientists regularly reveal new insights into the most mysterious realms of these expansive waters. Many alien ecosystems dwell in previously unknown canyons or cling to submerged mountains.\n\nIn 2024, the Schmidt Ocean Institute, an ocean exploration group that uses a robot capable of probing depths down to 14,760 feet (4,500 meters), embarked on a 55-day expedition that exemplifies the wild sightings found at these depths. Their remotely operated vehicle (ROV), SuBastian, spotted a colossal meeting or migration of crabs, a shimmering, psychedelic marine worm, life flourishing around deep methane seeps, and possibly 60 new species.\n\n\"Every time we put the ROV down with its 4K cameras onboard, we see some amazing biodiversity,\" Jyotika Virmani, an oceanographer and executive director of the Schmidt Ocean Institute, told Mashable.\n\n\"It was just one thing after another,\" she added.\n\nThe view below shows the impressive, uncountable amassing of crabs during Schmidt's recent Chile Margin expedition. \"Yesterday, we came across a crazy conflagration of crabs 400 meters down. Migration route? Mating season?\" Jeffrey Marlow, a biologist from Boston University and chief scientist of the trip, posted online.\n\nSubmersibles crewed by biologists can certainly perform unique science, but ROVs have exploration benefits. Unlike people, they don't need oxygen, and can stay down for a long time. \"We can operate it for two days if we need to,\" Virmani said. It's relatively easy to try out new technologies aboard these robots, and the ROV can also collect and bring samples back to the surface.\n\nBelow, you'll find the otherworldly scenes captured by the Schmidt Ocean Institute and other deep sea explorers in 2024.\n\nFootage of extremely ancient deep sea creatures\n\nA deep sea mission, undertaken by the Ocean Exploration Trust aboard their 223-foot vessel (E/V) Nautilus, spotted four nautilus individuals. Creatures similar to these modern-day nautiloids \u2014 swimming mollusks residing in large shells \u2014 have been on Earth for some 500 million years, evolving much earlier than the dinosaurs.\n\nBut the creatures aren't easy to find. The Ocean Trust explorers have endeavored into the deep sea for 15 years and taken over 1,000 dives with their remotely operated vehicle. But these are the first nautiloids they've spotted.\n\n\"It's finally happened,\" a member of the exploration team said at the beginning of the footage, shown in the video below. The nautiloids were swimming in a south Pacific Ocean channel off Palau.\n\nSquid with a huge brood of eggs\n\nDuring their 55-day voyage through the Chile Margin, the Schmidt Ocean Institute serendipitously spotted a mother black-eyed squid clutching a large brood of eggs. Gonatus squids can brood up to 3,000 eggs at a time.\n\n\"It's not often you get to see that,\" Virmani said.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

OceanX often explores the deep ocean, but this scene is from shallower depths.\n\n\"The octopuses appeared to punch the fish to enforce social order and keep the hunting group moving along,\" OceanX explained in their video, below. \"Researchers theorize that the octopuses hunt with the fish to find prey more easily, and the fish hunt with the octopuses to root out prey hiding in crevices.\"\n\nDiscovery of the \"mystery mollusc\"\n\nScientists at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute identified an intriguing new deep sea species off California. It's see-through, can glow, and nabs prey with a large hood. At one point while filming, researchers watched it detach one of its finger-like appendages, likely as a decoy for a predator. The glowing appendage then floated away.\n\n\"When we first filmed it glowing with the ROV, everyone in the control room let out a loud 'Oooooh!' at the same time. We were all enchanted by the sight,\" Steven Haddock, a senior scientist at the institute, said in a statement.\n\nBelow, you can view brilliant footage of the animal, which biologists have dubbed the \"mystery mollusc.\" It now also has a scientific name, Bathydevius caudactylus, and after years of observation and genetic testing, scientists have concluded it's a species of nudibranch, more popularly known as sea slugs.\n\nWild deep sea squid sighting\n\nA baited robotic lander lured a magnapinna \u2014 a rarely seen bigfin squid \u2014 and allowed researchers from Minderoo-UWA Deep-Sea Research Centre and Inkfish to film this cryptic footage. The squid was observed in the Tonga Trench, located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.\n\n\"Exceptional\" footage of two deep sea critters\n\n\"While diving on an unnamed seamount west of Babeldaob near the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, ROV Hercules happened upon two gorgeous deep sea creatures,\" writes the Ocean Exploration Trust.\n\nSeen first is a Chaunacops, an anglerfish with a large lure. Next is a clear view of a dumbo octopus, named for its ear-like fins.\n\nShimmering creature in the remote ocean\n\nWhile investigating the little-explored Chilean coast \u2014 with seeps and vents emitting nutrients into the water \u2014 the Schmidt Ocean Institute spotted a curious, almost alien-looking species: a shimmering species of polychaete crawling on the seafloor. It's a psychedelic marine worm.\n\nYou can see this slow-moving creature's sparkling bristles, or chaetae, in the video below.\n\nPolychaetes are extremely diverse organisms.\n\n\"The visual variety among the more than 10,000 described species means a polychaete enthusiast is never bored,\" Karen Osborn, the curator of Marine Invertebrates at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, explains. \"They come in every imaginable color and pattern, from completely transparent to iridescent to candy-striped.\"\n\nPredator discovery at 26,000 feet down\n\nThe newly discovered deep sea predator, Dulcibella camanchaca. Credit: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n\nDeep Sea biologists found a new animal some 26,000 feet (7,902 meters) underwater in the ocean's \"hadal zone,\" named for the Greek god of the underworld, Hades. These researchers lowered baited traps into the Atacama Trench off of Chile, and brought up four individuals of a species now called Dulcibella camanchaca.\n\n\"Dulcibella camanchaca is a fast-swimming predator that we named after 'darkness' in the languages of the peoples from the Andes region to signify the deep, dark ocean from where it predates,\" Johanna Weston, a hadal ecologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who coauthored the discovery, said in a statement.\n\nIn the hadal zone, the deepest ocean realm, many critters depend on food sinking down from the more productive waters above. But Dulcibella camanchaca isn't a scavenger. The four-centimeter (1.5-inch) crustacean (an arthropod with a hard shell like a crab) captures smaller hadal crustaceans.\n\nDeep sea exploration does much more than illuminate wonder.\n\nScientists want to shine a light \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 on what's down there. The implications of knowing are incalculable, particularly as deep sea mineral prospectors prepare to run tank-like industrial equipment across parts of the seafloor. For example, research expeditions have found that ocean life carries great potential for novel medicines. \"Systematic searches for new drugs have shown that marine invertebrates produce more antibiotic, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory substances than any group of terrestrial organisms,\" notes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .\n\n\"There's life down there that has the potential to provide and has provided us with medicines,\" Virmani said."

            "article_content": "Hubble Space Telescope image of galaxy NGC 5084's core. A dark, vertical line near the center shows the curve of a dusty disk orbiting the core, whose presence suggests a supermassive black hole within. The disk and black hole share the same orientation, fully tipped over from the horizontal orientation of the galaxy.\n\nProbing a distant galaxy like a \"cosmic crime scene\" with the Hubble Space Telescope after a \"tip-off\" from the Chandra X-ray telescope, NASA scientists have discovered a strange black hole that is tipped onto its side.\n\nThe sideways black hole was discovered in the galaxy NGC 5084, a lenticular (lens-shaped) galaxy located around 80 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of Virgo. The black hole rotates in an unexpected direction in relation to its surrounding galaxy.\n\nThe team was tipped off to the existence of this black hole when they discovered two plumes of plasma, one that extends above and below the plane of the galaxy and one that stretches through the galaxy, crossing each other and making an \"X\" shape. This galactic structure is something astronomers have never seen before.\n\n\"Detecting two pairs of X-ray plumes in one galaxy is exceptional,\" team member and Ames Research Center astrophysicist Pamela Marcum said in a statement . \"The combination of their unusual, cross-shaped structure and the 'tipped-over,' dusty disk gives us unique insights into this galaxy's history.\"\n\nThe scientists behind the discovery think that a dramatic event in the history of NGC 5084 may be responsible for knocking this black hole over on its side like a \"cosmic hit and run.\"\n\nX marks the WHAT?\n\nThe team made the discovery in archival data from Chandra thanks to a new image analysis they developed. This technique, \"Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal\" or \"SAUNAS,\" teases out low-brightness X-ray emissions from NASA's powerful X-ray space telescope, revealing the strange X-shaped twin plasma plumes.\n\nThis was odd because when astronomers see X-rays emitted from massive galaxies, they expect to find them evenly spread out. This homogeneity would result in a sphere of high-energy light. The sight of a concentrated shape of X-rays indicates a dramatic event in the history of a galaxy.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

They did this by scouring the archives of other telescopes and with new observations from two powerful ground-based observatories.\n\nAn illustration shows a supermassive black tilted on its side (Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nObservations from Hubble backed by data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) , 66 radio antennas based in northern Chile, showed a dusty ring of material at the heart of NGC 5084, turning on its side. This indicated not only a black hole lurking at the center of this galaxy but that object was bizarrely rotated at a 90-degree angle to NGC 5084.\n\nThe follow-up examinations of NGC 5084 helped the team see this galaxy and its sideways black hole across a wide range of light wavelengths.\n\n\"It was like seeing a crime scene with multiple types of light,\" team leader and Ames Research Center scientist Alejandro Serrano Borlaff said in a statement. \u201cPutting all the pictures together revealed that NGC 5084 has changed a lot in its recent past.\"\n\nSo what \"crime\" does the team suspect has taken place in NGC 5084 and knocked over this black hole?\n\n\n\nCurrently, the \"prime suspect\" in this cosmic whodunnit is a collision with another galaxy that generated a \"chimney\" of plasma that erupted from the top and bottom of NGC 5084's plane.\n\nThough more investigations of NGC 5084 will be needed to properly determine the violent event that sculpted its strange structure, this research demonstrates the power of archival data, even dating back as far as three decades, to help scientists make new and unique discoveries.\n\nThis data is especially powerful when coupled with an innovative processing technique, such as that developed by Borlaff and colleagues.\n\nThe team's research was published Dec. 18 in the Astrophysical Journal ."

Elon Musk, who cofounded the company but left the board in 2018, filed a lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI in February. Musk withdrew the lawsuit in June but filed a new lawsuit in August in which he argued that OpenAI executives \"deceived\" him into cofounding the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmid its legal challenges, OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in funding in October \u2014 a record-high funding round for tech in Silicon Valley \u2014 pushing the company's valuation to $157 billion.\n\nNow, Altman is looking at what's in store for the new year, and he's crowdsourcing ideas on how to continue advancing and improving not just ChatGPT but all of the company's existing and emerging products.\n\nHere are three ideas Altman appears to be eyeing so far.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFamily accounts\n\nOne X follower responded to Altman's post with a suggestion to allow OpenAI users to create accounts for families that include guardrails, allowing kids to use the platform safely.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Let their curiosity take off, but within reasonable limits, as determined by the parent,\" the user wrote, to which Altman responded: \"this is a good idea!\"\n\nOpenAI's website states that ChatGPT isn't meant for children under 13 and requires parental consent for children ages 13 to 18 to use the platform, but does not actively verify the consent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImprovements to voice chats\n\nChatGPT developed a voice feature that allows users to speak directly to the chatbot. One of Altman's followers suggested that the feature be improved because, as of now, per the user, \"you can't just silently think for 5 seconds without being interrupted.\"\n\nAltman wrote that that's a \"good point.\" Users have struggled with the feature since it was rolled out, with some having reported bugs and misinterpretations from the chatbot.\n\nBetter video generation\n\nMultiple users urged Altman to improve Sora, OpenAI's text-to-video model. Sora allows users to describe a video they want the platform to create with a written prompt, which Sora will generate based on the text.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSora officially launched on December 9 after being piloted to a limited group of creators in February. Rohan Sahai, Sora's product lead, said at the launch that the product would begin more conservatively because its team wants to prevent illegal activity like copyright violations while allowing for creative expression.\n\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider."

As reported by The Information, OpenAI plans to enter the humanoid robot sector. Reportedly, the company has been in discussions about bringing humanoid robots. Let\u2019s have a look at what big plans it has ahead of 2024.\n\nOpenAI to bring humanoid robot\n\nUntil 2021 OpenAI had a specific division for robots. However, it had to shut down the division as it decided to focus more on artificial intelligence software. The confirmation was made by Wojciech Zaremba, the leader of that division during that time. He announced in a podcast that the team gave up on it because they couldn\u2019t train something according to the desired intelligence level.\n\nAlso Read Brands play the game!

Some other reports suggest that OpenAI also aims to collaborate with TSMC and Broadcom. The aim is to develop their first in-house chip to support its artificial intelligence systems.\n\nThe future plans\n\nLooking forward,OpenAI has also been investing in robotic startups. The list includes Physical Intelligence, Figure AI and 1X Technologies. These startups have been working on building humanoid robots and developing artificial general intelligence or AGI.\n\nIn addition to this, OpenAI is also planning to develop its reasoning model and an AI agent. These will be designed to \u2018help automate all manner of software engineering and analysis tasks\u2019. However, as of now no official announcement has been made about these plans.\n\nWell, OpenAI is not the only one to make its mark in the humanoid robot space. Already there are other players existing. For example, you have the Tesla Bot named Optimus, and Atlas by Boston Dynamics. Looks like OpenAI also wants to enter the market and compete in this space."

Elon Musk-led AI startup xAI has raised $6 billion in Series C funding, valuing the company at around $40 billion, up from $24 billion earlier this year. Some of the notable investors who participated in this round include semiconductor giants Nvidia and AMD, as well as major VCs and asset management firms, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and more.\n\nIn total, 97 investors were involved in this round of funding, with the minimum investment per participant pegged at $77,593. Investors were only allowed to participate if they had helped Musk raise funds for his Twitter acquisition in 2022. xAI is reportedly planning to raise additional funds next year as it strives to compete with Google and OpenAI, which have opened up a substantial lead in the high-stakes generative AI game.\n\nSince closing its Series B funding round in May 2024, xAI has built a high-power supercomputer called 'Colossus' and released its Grok-2 frontier language model with state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities. Colossus is expected to make it easier for xAI to build and test its AI models, including the aforementioned Grok LLMs that power a chatbot for X Premium users and the Flux image generator.\n\nBelieved to be the world's largest supercomputer, Colossus is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, each costing upwards of $30,000. xAI plans to use some of the new funds to double the size of Colossus to 200,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs.\n\nMusk is an important player in the AI sector, having helped found OpenAI in 2015. However, he left the project in 2018 following disagreements with other co-founders, including Sam Altman, who is currently the company's CEO. Musk has also often sounded the alarm against AI, claiming it could destroy humanity without sufficient guardrails.\n\nAs part of his continuing battle against OpenAI and its founders, Musk sued the company earlier this year, alleging \"deceit of Shakespearean proportions.\" According to his lawsuit, Altman and another co-founder, Greg Brockman, violated the founding contract that envisioned OpenAI as a non-profit organization dedicated to public good.\n\nAltman, however, rejected all charges, saying Musk was the one who originally wanted to establish OpenAI as a for-profit company. According to him, the founding members agreed in 2017 to convert OpenAI into a for-profit venture, but rejected Musk's demand for majority equity and the post of the company's CEO. He also alleged that the SpaceX and Tesla CEO is now trying to thwart OpenAI's progress to help his own fledgling AI startup."

Sam Altman said it was a good idea.\n\nthis is a good idea! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nBetter Advanced Voice Mode chats\n\nA different person wants ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode to have better memory so it can recall previous text and voice conversations.\n\nreally want to figure this one out! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nA ChatGPT user asked for better turn detection in Advanced Voice Mode so you can think silently for 5 seconds without interruptions.\n\ngood point \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nA \u201cgrown-up\u201d ChatGPT mode\n\nWhile a ChatGPT mode for kids would require additional protections, an X user asked for a \u201cgrown-up\u201d version that would lose the existing guardrails. Needless to say, no AI company will remove guardrails from its models, but Alman said that ChatGPT does need a \u201cgrown-up mode.\u201d\n\ndefinitely need some sort of \u201cgrown up mode\u201d \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nAI models interoperability\n\nSomeone wants a new ChatGPT UI that supports drag-and-drop so you can combine different chats and models for improved responses. Altman called it an \u201cinteresting\u201d idea that he hadn\u2019t thought of.\n\nthis is an interesting idea i haven\u2019t really thought about before! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nChatGPT AI agents\n\nThe ChatGPT app for macOS is the closest thing we have to ChatGPT AI agents, but it\u2019s not quite that. Rumors say OpenAI is working on AI agents in addition to GPT-5. Someone asked for proper agents for 2025, to which Altman responded with, \u201cHappy 2025!\u201d I see that as a teaser that AI agents are coming to ChatGPT next.\n\nhappy 2025! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nA good base ChatGPT model\n\nAltman also agreed with someone\u2019s suggestion that ChatGPT needs a better base non-thinking model., as \u201cGPT-4o kinda sucks right now.\u201d\n\ndefinitely \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nRegarding GPT-4o, someone asked for image generation support, with Altman saying he hoped it\u2019s coming.\n\nhope to! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nA better Sora\n\nOpenAI has just released the text-to-video generator, but some users have already requested improvements. That\u2019s coming next year, and I\u2019ll remind you that we saw a Sora 2 demo leak around when Sora came out.\n\ndefinitely \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nAltman teased \u201clots of Sora improvements\u201d when another X user asked for specific Sora upgrades.\n\nlots of sora improvements coming! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nMiscellaneous upgrades across the board\n\nSome X users gave Altman lists of suggestions, like the one in the tweet below. Altman said it was a \u201cvery good list,\u201d and that users will hopefully be \u201cquite happy\u201d with ChatGPT next year.\n\nvery good list! hopefully you\u2019ll be quite happy with us next year overall \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nAltman also addressed suggestions about ChatGPT getting a bigger context limit, larger rate limits, and cheaper prices. However, there\u2019s no guarantee that OpenAI will actually be able to offer these next year.\n\nrate limits up, context up, and costs down! \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nWhat about ChatGPT hardware?\n\nWe know OpenAI has partnered with Jony Ive to manufacture a mysterious ChatGPT hardware device. We have no idea when it\u2019s coming, but an X user suggested it for 2025 as an \u201cunexpected\u201d announcement. Here\u2019s how Altman responded to it:\n\n\ud83d\udc40 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 25, 2024\n\nThe list of suggested ChatGPT features for 2025 includes other tidbits. Altman might be reacting to all of it. However, the \u201chardware play\u201d suggestion is enough to warrant the response above. Even if the ChatGPT hardware will be unveiled next year, and there\u2019s no indication it will be, Altman would probably avoid addressing it this early."

            "article_content": "The bill tabled on 19 November by Ugo Bernalicis, a member of the left-wing party France Unbowed (La France insoumise, LFI), to remove the incrimination of \"apology for terrorism\" from the penal code has sparked a fierce controversy in the country.\n\nThis provision has, in fact, been widely used since 7 October 2023 to criminalise statements of support for the Palestinians.\n\nCritics immediately went wild. \"It must be fought with the greatest force,\" declared Justice Minister Didier Migaud. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was outraged, saying: \"It is difficult to do [anything] more despicable.\"\n\nEven within the ranks of the Socialist Party (Parti socialist, PS), an ally of France Unbowed, regional elected official Carole Delga denounced a \"moral failure in the face of the victims of terrorism and the bereaved families\".\n\nThe less severe commentators criticised LFI for a justified but solitary and poorly worded initiative. However, no political leader and few TV debate hosts considered it necessary and legitimate to address the substance of the subject.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nLFI MP Manuel Bompard commented by saying that he was \"flabbergasted by the Trumpification of the debate\" and \"the intellectual laziness of the media class\".\n\nThe intent of the bill was not simply to repeal the criminal offence of apology for terrorism but to return it to the press law, from which it had been taken and integrated into the penal code by legislation adopted on 13 November 2014.\n\nThe urgent need at the time was to counter the propaganda of organisations claiming to be part of the so-called \"international jihad\" in the context of the proclamation of a caliphate by the Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq in June 2014.\n\nThe group\u2019s propaganda aimed to seduce young Europeans by glorifying its fighters, with the goal of enlisting them or mobilising them to commit attacks in Europe. The press law was totally unsuitable for facing this phenomenon.\n\nThe point of the 2014 legal change was mainly to lift the constraints that slowed down investigations, authorise pretrial detentions and immediate court appearances, allow for evidence seizures, and mobilise anti-terrorism surveillance resources.\n\nIn the traumatic, if not hysterical, atmosphere generated in France by the January and November 2015 attacks, the number of reports - encouraged by the government - for comments made on social media, in the workplace or even at school increased from 1,500 to 35,000 in one year.\n\nCriminalisation of simple comments\n\nBut since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October last year, the use of the qualification of apology for terrorism has experienced a new surge.\n\nAs early as 10 October, then-Justice Minister Eric Dupont-Moretti instructed prosecutors to pursue \"public remarks praising [these] attacks, presenting them as legitimate resistance to Israel, or the public propagation of messages inciting a favourable judgment on Hamas or Islamic Jihad because of the attacks they organised\".\n\nHundreds of investigations have been launched. By the end of January 2024, Le Monde counted 626 such enquiries targeting ordinary citizens, influencers, students, members of civil society organisations, union activists, journalists, academics (such as Francois Burgat), political leaders, local elected officials and even two LFI high-profile members: MP Mathilde Panot and future MEP Rima Hassan.\n\nThe vast majority of French political, media and intellectual elites have integrated the Israeli narrative. Those who deviate from it are treated as heretics, either \"antisemitic Islamists\" or \"collaborators\"\n\nFor having equated Hamas\u2019 \"heroic\" action to an act of \"resistance\", an activist was sentenced to pay \u20ac3,000 ($3,120) in damages to Jewish organisations that filed a civil suit against him. He was also added to the national register of terrorist offences perpetrators, FIJAIT, for 10 years, requiring him to report his home address every three months and notify authorities of any international travel at least two weeks in advance.\n\nAmong the most emblematic cases was that of a union leader, Jean-Paul Delescaut, sentenced in April to a one-year suspended prison sentence for a leaflet published by his organisation which stated that \u201cthe horrors of the illegal occupation have accumulated. Since Saturday, they have been receiving the responses they provoked\u201d.\n\nThe mere reminder of the historical context was considered a justification, as it failed to express sufficient moral disapproval, according to the terms of the judgment.\n\nPeople with Arab-sounding names have particularly aroused suspicion and police have paid a lot of attention to signs of religious practice, as though such practices indicate a predisposition to terrorism - reducing the conflict to a confessional clash devoid of any political rationality.\n\nWarnings ignored\n\nCritics of the legislation proposed by LFI have deliberately ignored years of warnings issued by various authoritative human rights organisations about France's apology for terrorism law.\n\nIn 2017, ombudsman Jacques Toubon expressed his deep concern for \"a vagueness incompatible with freedom of expression and information\" and warned against the \u201ctargeting of a section of the population\" (ie Muslims).\n\nIn a report issued in May 2019, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism highlighted \u201cthe weighty effects of the offence of \u2018apology for terrorism\u2019 on the right to freedom of expression\".\n\nFrance's 'apology for terrorism' law used to 'criminalise' Palestine solidarity Read More \u00bb\n\nThe report stated: \"The law is broadly drafted, engaging significant legal uncertainty, enabling discretionary overreach and affecting the protection of free expression and the open exchange of ideas in a robust democracy.\"\n\nMore recently, in April, the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (CNCDH) explained to the justice minister that its circular \"may have generated confusion between approval, praise of a crime and/or criminals, and stances relating to the context in which they were committed. The latter are part of a debate of ideas and should therefore be able to enjoy freedom of expression\".\n\nEven a former anti-terrorist judge, Marc Trevidic, who had recommended the inclusion of the apology for terrorism offence in the penal code at the time, denounced\"a totally perverted use of the law\" last October.\n\n\"A simple tag in support of Palestine makes you risk prison,\" he wrote, calling for \"a U-turn\".\n\nJudges as guardians of dogma\n\nIn such an atmosphere, the LFI bill has little chance of being included on the parliamentary agenda. On the other hand, the irrational fury it has triggered says a lot about the evolution of the public debate in France.\n\nThe time when Jean-Paul Sartre could say, the day after the hostage-taking of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games by the Black September organisation, that \"the Palestinians have no other choice for lack of weapons, defenders than to resort to terrorism\" seems far removed from today.\n\nBy granting immunity to Netanyahu, France is fuelling the genocide Read More \u00bb\n\nThe philosopher\u2019s statement, while not consensual, resonated with the still vivid historical memory of national liberation struggles.\n\nOne may even think that if two former presidents, Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou, were alive in our time, they could have been targeted by a denunciation for the apology for terrorism. In November 1967, Charles de Gaulle declared: \u201cIsrael is setting up in the territories it has captured an occupation that will inevitably involve oppression, repression and expulsions, and a resistance to this occupation is forming, which Israel in turn classes as terrorism.\u201d\n\nAfter the Munich events, Pompidou said: \"We will not eliminate Palestinian terrorism if we do not have some kind of solution to the Palestinian problem.\"\n\nSince 11 September 2001, the US \"war on terror\" rhetoric has progressively globalised the definition of terrorism as the figure of absolute evil, abstracted from any historical context, for which only the perpetrator bears responsibility.\n\nThe attacks committed on European soil by IS have allowed Israeli leaders to popularise their narrative of terrorism as a global threat against the West and an ideology carried by political Islam - or even by Muslims as a whole.\n\nTherefore, any attempt to rationally explain its causes is regarded as a reprehensible way of justifying it. Faced with this vital danger, only the use of limitless violence is seen as the legitimate response.\n\nThe vast majority of French political, media and intellectual elites have integrated the Israeli narrative into the republican orthodoxy. Those who deviate from it are treated as heretics, if not \u201cinner enemies\u201d, labelled either \"antisemitic Islamists\" or \"collaborators\" - a term loaded with historical significance in France, where it was used to describe Nazi allies during the occupation from 1940 to 1945.\n\nJudges, contrary to their traditional calling as \"guardians of freedoms\", are set to become the guardians of dogma. Contrary to Clausewitz's adage, according to which war is the continuation of politics by other means, in France, the law - or rather, the political use of the law - has become the prolongation of war in the realm of public opinion.\n\nThe same trend is at work in Germany and the United States. The war waged by Israel is accelerating the authoritarian and xenophobic drift of the states that support it.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye."

            "article_content": "Even as the dependence of non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) on bank loans has moderated slightly post hike in risk weights, the sector\u2019s reliance on funding from banks continues to remain high and shadow lenders must diversify their sources of funds as a risk mitigation strategy, a report from the Reserve Bank of India stated.\n\n\u201cThe dependence of NBFCs on banks remain high, notwithstanding some moderation; NBFCs need to further diversify their sources of funds as a risk mitigation strategy. An imprudent \u2018growth at any cost\u2019 approach would be counter-productive, and a robust risk management framework should be implemented,\u201d the report on FY24 trends and progress in banking noted. Businessline had reported in October that the regulator had asked NBFCs, especially upper layer ones, to maintain 25 per cent of their liabilities from capital markets.\n\nDuring FY24 the balance sheet of NBFCs expanded in double digits to 16.3 per cent as compared with 17.2 per cent in the preceding year, the report stated.\n\nOn the liability side, NBFCs\u2019 borrowings from banks decelerated, while funds raised through debentures picked up, reflecting the impact of higher risk-weights. The NBFCs also relied on securitisation to raise funds. On the asset side, growth in loans accelerated to 18.5 per cent in FY24 from 17.4 per cent in FY23, driven by upper layer NBFCs. Meanwhile, middle layer NBFCs saw relatively muted growth on account of contraction in unsecured loans.\n\nVehicle loans, gold loans and microfinance loans remained the stronghold of NBFCs, accounting for 56.7 per cent of their retail portfolio at end-March 2024. Vehicle loans in particular remain the largest component of NBFCs\u2019 retail loan portfolio, with a share of 34.7 per cent at March-end.\n\nVigilance needed\n\nThe RBI report noted while the share of special mention accounts-2 (SMA) has come down, NBFCs must be vigilant about the rise in the shares of SMA-0 and SMA-1 accounts in FY24. Lenders categorise stressed loans under SMA categories. Loans under SMA-O category are overdue for up to 30 days, SMA-1 highlights loans unpaid for more than 30 days but less than 60 days, while SMA-2 shows payments overdue between 61-90 days. An account is classified as non-performing if repayment is overdue for over 90 days.\n\nSeparately, the RBI has cancelled the registration certificate of 143 NBFCs due to voluntary surrender of license, violation of guidelines including those related to data confidentiality and security of customer information, code of conduct in outsourcing of financial services and the fair practices code.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, besides the challenges emanating from cybersecurity threats, NBFCs need to be mindful of the evolving concentration risk and climate-related financial risks associated with credit to certain sectors,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cMoreover, they need to strengthen their initiatives to address customer grievances, adhere to fair practices and avoid recourse to usurious interest rates so as to ensure their relevance in a fast-changing financial landscape,\u201d it added."

CREDITL \u00a9 Josephine Schubert, Museum Burg Ranis.\n\nIn January, a new genetic analysis of bone fragments from an archaeological site in central Germany found that modern humans had reached northern Europe 45,000 years ago. This new timeline means that their arrival overlapped with the Neanderthals who had been living there for several thousand years before going extinct. It also bolsters the theory that the movement of modern humans into Europe and Asia about 50,000 years ago helped drive Neanderthals into extinction. The findings were described in three separate papers published in the journals Nature and Nature Ecology and Evolution.\n\nMysterious Iron Age burials\n\nThe skeletal remains of a frog and a human were uncovered at Seminario Vescovile in Verona, Italy. CREDIT: S.R. Thompson/SABAP-VR/Laffranchi et al., 2024\n\nA team of archeologists from Italy and Switzerland found that animals buried alongside humans might have been intended to be a meal or companion in the afterlife. They also may have been part of a complex funeral rite during the Iron Age, according to their study published in February in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nOf the 161 people buried at the Seminario Vescovile site in Verona, Italy, 16 were buried alongside animals. Four of the people at this site were buried alongside the remains of dogs and/or horses. These animals were not commonly eaten and the presence of horses and dogs was significant to the team. Earlier Iron Age findings in France and Switzerland indicate that horses and dogs were symbolic at the time and were often present in what appears to be sacrificial rituals, funeral rites, and are frequently associated with specific deities from the time. For the team on this study, the characteristics of a plot called Burial 46 were particularly interesting.\n\n\u201cIt includes the complete skeleton of a horse positioned above a woman, along with the cranium of a dog and the remains of additional horses,\u201d Marco Milella, a co-author of the new study and anthropologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told Popular Science. \u201cThis discovery provides a glimpse into a remarkably complex funerary ritual. While drawing scientifically robust conclusions from just two cases is challenging, we are prompted to consider whether this occurrence is merely coincidental or indicative of a deeper pattern.\u201d\n\nAncient Maya ballcourts were for more than games\n\n\n\nA decorative ring made from carved stone is embedded in the wall of a ballcourt in the ancient Maya city of Chichen Itza in present day Mexico. CREDIT: LanaCanada.\n\n\n\nAncient Mayans may have made ceremonial offerings during the construction of the ballcourts that they used for sporting events. Advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis helped a team of scientists detect evidence of several plants that are known for both medicinal and religious purposes. The team found evidence of four different plants that are associated with ancient Maya medicine and divination rituals.\n\nThese microscopic fragments of ancient plants were found beneath the floor of a Mayan ballcourt in present day Mexico and collecting them was likely purposeful. The findings were described in a study published in the journal PLOS One in April.\n\nThe ball courts in this study were used for several ball games, including pok-a-tok. This combination of soccer and basketball is also undergoing a present day revival. Players likely tried to get a ball through a ring in a hoop affixed to a wall. Ballcourts were considered significant places within cities and even built near some of the largest temples, including in ancient Maya cities like Tikal in Guatemala.\n\n[Related: Tooth powder unlocks clues to an 800-year-old mystery of man thrown into well.]\n\nDecoding the Norton Disney Dodecaheadron\n\nThe dodecahedron on display at the National Civil War Centre, Newark Museum. CREDIT: Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group.\n\nIn the spring, the largest known Roman dodecahedron went on display in England.The cast bronze object was uncovered in the village of Norton Disney in the Midlands of eastern England It is hollow at its middle and roughly the size of a clenched fist and has 12 flat faces are shaped like pentagons. At roughly three inches tall and weighing half a pound, it is one of the largest of these strange Roman objects ever discovered.\n\nThe dodecahedron was sitting among the ruins of a Roman pit and was likely placed there about 1,700 years ago. It was found \u201cin situ,\u201d or deliberately placed among 4th Century CE Roman pottery in some sort of hole or quarry. More archeological excavation is needed to clarify exactly what this pit was used for.\n\n\u201cRoman society was full of superstition, something experienced on a daily basis,\u201d the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group wrote in a statement. \u201cA potential link with local religious practice is our current working theory. More investigation is required though.\u201d\n\nArchaeology in space?\n\nA sample location in the starboard Maintenance Work Area of the International Space Station. The yellow dotted line indicates the boundaries of the sample area. CREDIT: NASA / ISSAP\n\nThe icy cold reaches of space is not exactly the first place to come to mind for archaeological discoveries. That didn\u2019t stop a team from California\u2019s Chapman University to see what they could find on the International Space Station (ISS). The team applied a traditional field strategy aboard the ISS for the first time. They applied the shovel test pit to analyze how the ever-changing \u201cmicrosociety\u201d aboard the ISS has adapted and changed over time.\n\nBack here on Earth, these projects typically involve digging small excavations at regular intervals across a site to gather information on how artifacts are distributed, then pick particularly promising pits for more thorough study. Since there really isn\u2019t anything to \u201cdig\u201d on the ISS, the team selected six locations throughout the space station and tasked astronauts to take daily photos of each space over roughly two months in 2022.\n\nTheir study published in August in the journal PLOS ONE identified 5,438 examples of \u201cartifacts\u201d including an augmented reality headset, Post-It notes, gloves, tools, and writing tools like Sharpie pens. While it is only an initial survey into this subject matter, it\u2019s the first of its kind to document how humans adapt to a novel environment completely removed from what we as a species evolved to handle.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

CREDIT: Professor Nick Pearce, Aberystwyth University, Picasa\n\nIn August, a new hypothesis for where Stonehenge\u2019s six-ton Altar Stone originated was published in the journal Nature. It likely originated 400 miles north in Scotland and not from Wales or other closer areas of southern England as scientists previously thought. This long trek points to the possibility that more advanced transportation methods and societal organization existed here about 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe Altar Stone is about 16 feet long and 19 inches thick and sits at the center of the circle. While it is not currently standing upright like the other stones, scientists are still uncertain if it stood vertically at some point. It arrived in the area sometime around 2,500 BCE, but its exact arrival date is still a mystery.\n\nChemical fingerprints within the grains matched rocks from northeast Scotland and were very different from Welsh bedrock. Specifically, with the age of the zircon minerals in the stone, the team is over 95 percent certain that it came all the way from northeastern Scotland.\n\nCheesy mummies\n\nTarim mummies from the present-day Xinjiang region of Northwestern China. CREDIT: Wenying Li\n\nAt least three embalmed bodies buried with some cheese on them were discovered at an ancient burial site in Xinjiang in northwestern China. The small lumps of fermented dairy, laid around the necks of the deceased, represent the longest-aged cheese ever discovered\u2013at roughly 3,500 years old.\n\nThe ancient cheese was incredibly well-preserved, but a new assessment of the chunks reveals some long-obsecured knowledge about human culture and a potential path for how dairy may have spread across Asia. The findings were published in the journal Cell in September.\n\nA new look at an Ancient Egyptian mummy\n\nLady Chenet-aa\u2019s mummy included artificial eyes to help her see in the afterlife. CREDIT: The Field Museum / Morgan Clark / Popular Science\n\nA team from Chicago\u2019s Field Museum used a CT scanner to determine Ancient Egyptian Lady Chenet-aa\u2019s burial procedure. Lady Chenet-aa lived roughly 3,000 years ago amid the 22nd Dynasty during Egypt\u2019s Third Intermediate Period. Soon after her death, one of the ways funerary experts prepared her for the afterlife was by constructing a cartonnage\u2014a paper mache-like box housing a deceased person\u2019s body.\n\nHowever, Chenet-aa\u2019s lacks any hint of a visible seam, leaving Egyptologists to wonder for years exactly how embalmers placed her inside the casing. Field Museum senior conservator JP Brown likened the mummy and its cartonnage coffin to a model ship inside a bottle.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly important that the inner coffin appeared whole and smooth without any external seams (unlike the outer coffin which was made of wood),\u201d Brown explained to Popular Science. \u201c\u2026 [and] if you look at the shape of cartonnage, the opening at the foot is too narrow for the mummy\u2019s shoulders to fit through.\u201d\n\nPompeii DNA tells a different story\n\nTwo of the plaster body casts from the Pompeii archaeological site. CREDIT: Archaeological Park of Pompei\n\nA new genetic analysis of 14 bodies recovered from Pompeii shed doubt on some of the initial interpretations of who these people were before the cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Using a new genomic analysis, a team of scientists found that their biological sexes and family relationships don\u2019t match up with the initial interpretations. The findings were published in November in the journal Current Biology.\n\nOne notable example is an adult wearing a golden bracelet found holding a child. This was traditionally interpreted to be a mother and child, but the new analysis found that it was an unrelated adult male and child. Additionally, a pair believed to be sisters or mother and daughter, included one genetic male.\n\n[Related: Focaccia likely originated in Mesopotamia, not Rome.]\n\nNeanderthals also loved to collect things\n\nThese marine fossils were found in a Neanderthal cave site, but aren\u2019t native to the area. CREDIT: Quaternary\n\nThe act of collecting objects may stretch at least as far back as our Neanderthal ancestry, according to relics uncovered in a cave in Iberia, Spain.\n\nAn archeological team analyzed 15 small marine fossils found in the fourth level of the Prado Vargas Cave system. While one artifact showed physical evidence of use as a hammer, the other 14 fossils displayed no obvious physical wear or utilitarian value. Additional evidence in the caves also points to the site serving as a semi-permanent Neanderthal encampment likely used for toolmaking, hunting, or perhaps even ritualistic activities.\n\nEarlier research shows Neanderthals engaged in cultural rituals such as ornamental crafting, cave wall art, and even familial and social funeral burials. Due to these rituals, experts argue that it stands to reason the human ancestors likely participated in pastimes such as collecting items they thought were interesting or special in some way.\n\nMaking clothes fit for the ice age\n\nMicro-CT scans of bone needle and needle specimens and the species they were compared with. CREDIT: Pelton et al., 2024, PLOS ONE\n\nIn November, a team in Wyoming proposed the idea that Paleolithic North Americans likely made needles using the bones of foxes, hares, rabbits, bobcats, mountain lions, lynx, and even the now-extinct American cheetah.\n\nBone needles like the ones from this study are common during this period in the North American archaeological record because sewing complex weather garments for freezing weather was a necessity in response to the cold climate shift brought on by the last ice age. There has been little direct evidence of such garments, but bone needles and the bones of the fur-bearing animals used to make pelts provide some indirect evidence of this early tailoring.\n\n\u201cThey were complex garments fringed with the furs of red fox, hare, and cat, some of which with feet still attached as is common among modern trappers,\u201d study co-author and Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton told Popular Science. \u201cThey were likely comparable to similar garments worn by the Inuit, able to withstand the cold and windy conditions of Wyoming\u2019s last Ice Age.\u201d"

            "article_content": "As science continues its evolution, discoveries and technologies can act like a master key that opens doors that lead to novel advancements. Artificial intelligence is one such key, making innovations possible by solving complex problems, automating tasks and enabling research that would have been impossible, or very time-consuming, without it.\n\nBut do we want to do research on all topics, and shall we try the AI master key on every door? To explore this question, let\u2019s consider the use of AI by genomics experts as an example.\n\nIn recent years, genomics experts have added unbelievable depth to what we know about the world and ourselves. For example, genetics researchers have revealed facts about when certain animals and plants were domesticated. In another example, DNA found in 30,000-year-old permafrost was used to create fertile samples of a plant called narrow-leafed campion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportantly, genetic engineering techniques such as CRISPR facilitate extraordinary advances in the treatment of complicated conditions, such as sickle-cell anemia.\n\nThanks to AI developments, we are witnessing a dramatic increase in the pace and scalability of genomic techniques, which will allow researchers to embark on exploratory journeys \u2014 and at the same time, add urgency to already-existing ethical issues. AI companies are also most interested in the scientific implications of this technology. We see this demonstrated in a recent interview between Harvard Business School officials and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In response to the question, \u201cWhat are the pieces of AI that you are most excited about?\u201d Altman said: \u201cGreatly increasing the rate of scientific discovery is what I\u2019m most excited about.\u201d\n\nHowever, given the risks and possible consequences of AI use in science, should we rush headlong into using AI in all kinds of projects?\n\nOne relevant example is research on Neanderthals, our closest relatives, who lived until about 40,000 years ago. Neanderthals have been studied for several years now through genetic investigation of their fossils and their DNA. Genetic engineering can potentially use ancient DNA and genome editing methods to re-create a Neanderthal or aspects of a Neanderthal\u2019s genetics and physiology.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo do this, scientists could start by figuring out the DNA sequence of a Neanderthal by comparing it with the DNA of modern humans, since they are closely related. Then, scientists could use CRISPR to swap out parts of human DNA with Neanderthal DNA. This process would require a lot of trial and error and might not succeed soon, but based on what we know about genetics, if something is possible, AI can help make it happen faster, cheaper and with less effort.\n\nScientists are excited about these developments because they could facilitate new discoveries and open up many new research opportunities in genetic research.\n\nWith or without AI, research on Neanderthals will proceed, but the extraordinary power of AI could give the final push to these discoveries and facilitate this kind of resurrection. At that point, the scientific community must develop norms and guidelines about how to treat these resurrected beings with dispositions very similar to humans. We would need to carefully consider their rights and well-being almost in the same way as when humans are involved and not as research subjects or artifacts of scientific curiosity. These ethical issues are discussed in more detail in a new paper published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence.\n\nA more holistic question to consider is: Should we prioritize the use of resource-intensive AI, researchers\u2019 time and public funds to resurrect extinct beings? Or should we invest these resources into conserving species that are critically endangered today to prevent biodiversity from more degradation?\n\n_____\n\nMohammad Hosseini, Ph.D., is an assistant professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\n_____"

            "article_content": "Hubble Space Telescope image of galaxy NGC 5084's core. A dark, vertical line near the center shows the curve of a dusty disk orbiting the core, whose presence suggests a supermassive black hole within. The disk and black hole share the same orientation, fully tipped over from the horizontal orientation of the galaxy.\n\nProbing a distant galaxy like a \"cosmic crime scene\" with the Hubble Space Telescope after a \"tip-off\" from the Chandra X-ray telescope, NASA scientists have discovered a strange black hole that is tipped onto its side.\n\nThe sideways black hole was discovered in the galaxy NGC 5084, a lenticular (lens-shaped) galaxy located around 80 million light-years from Earth in the constellation of Virgo. The black hole rotates in an unexpected direction in relation to its surrounding galaxy.\n\nThe team was tipped off to the existence of this black hole when they discovered two plumes of plasma, one that extends above and below the plane of the galaxy and one that stretches through the galaxy, crossing each other and making an \"X\" shape. This galactic structure is something astronomers have never seen before.\n\n\"Detecting two pairs of X-ray plumes in one galaxy is exceptional,\" team member and Ames Research Center astrophysicist Pamela Marcum said in a statement . \"The combination of their unusual, cross-shaped structure and the 'tipped-over,' dusty disk gives us unique insights into this galaxy's history.\"\n\nThe scientists behind the discovery think that a dramatic event in the history of NGC 5084 may be responsible for knocking this black hole over on its side like a \"cosmic hit and run.\"\n\nX marks the WHAT?\n\nThe team made the discovery in archival data from Chandra thanks to a new image analysis they developed. This technique, \"Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal\" or \"SAUNAS,\" teases out low-brightness X-ray emissions from NASA's powerful X-ray space telescope, revealing the strange X-shaped twin plasma plumes.\n\nThis was odd because when astronomers see X-rays emitted from massive galaxies, they expect to find them evenly spread out. This homogeneity would result in a sphere of high-energy light. The sight of a concentrated shape of X-rays indicates a dramatic event in the history of a galaxy.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

They did this by scouring the archives of other telescopes and with new observations from two powerful ground-based observatories.\n\nAn illustration shows a supermassive black tilted on its side (Image credit: Robert Lea (created with Canva))\n\nObservations from Hubble backed by data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) , 66 radio antennas based in northern Chile, showed a dusty ring of material at the heart of NGC 5084, turning on its side. This indicated not only a black hole lurking at the center of this galaxy but that object was bizarrely rotated at a 90-degree angle to NGC 5084.\n\nThe follow-up examinations of NGC 5084 helped the team see this galaxy and its sideways black hole across a wide range of light wavelengths.\n\n\"It was like seeing a crime scene with multiple types of light,\" team leader and Ames Research Center scientist Alejandro Serrano Borlaff said in a statement. \u201cPutting all the pictures together revealed that NGC 5084 has changed a lot in its recent past.\"\n\nSo what \"crime\" does the team suspect has taken place in NGC 5084 and knocked over this black hole?\n\n\n\nCurrently, the \"prime suspect\" in this cosmic whodunnit is a collision with another galaxy that generated a \"chimney\" of plasma that erupted from the top and bottom of NGC 5084's plane.\n\nThough more investigations of NGC 5084 will be needed to properly determine the violent event that sculpted its strange structure, this research demonstrates the power of archival data, even dating back as far as three decades, to help scientists make new and unique discoveries.\n\nThis data is especially powerful when coupled with an innovative processing technique, such as that developed by Borlaff and colleagues.\n\nThe team's research was published Dec. 18 in the Astrophysical Journal ."

            "article_content": "It\u2019s the final rankings (in Europe\u2019s singing voice) \u2026 well, I\u2019ll also have a Week 18 edition for the absurd people or, hopefully, those betting, playing a one-off week, DFS or whatever. This week, we have abbreviated game previews and the good stuff! Yes, all the best (and worst) Christmas ranks! Oh, and actually, Week 17 fantasy football rankings, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReminder! I always have some \u201cfor fun\u201d ranks where I rate anything from cartoons to players from the \u201980s to things not to do when you\u2019re over 30 \u2014 feel free to suggest yours. I try to answer as many comments as humanly possible \u2026 however \u2026 simple questions such as, \u201cWho should I start?\u201d are covered, 99 percent of the time, within the rankings. Let\u2019s duckin\u2019 go!\n\n#CheckTheLink-age\n\nPRO TIP for RANKS FAST! Click the comment icon/button at the top right, which takes you down to the comments and a short scroll-up to the rankings widget. Yay.\n\nWEEK 17 FANTASY FOOTBALL PREVIEWS\n\nChiefs at Steelers, Wednesday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Hollywood Brown had the second-most targets (eight), but ran just 40% of the routes. That makes him a decent upside gamble, even against the Steelers. If Brown sees 60-70% or more of the route participation, he can put up 100+ yards and a Top 20 performance. But it\u2019s risky.\n\n\u25ba If George Pickens plays, start him, but Najee Harris and Calvin Austin are benchable. Jaylen Warren is a solid Flex option.\n\nRavens at Texans, Wednesday, 4:30 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Mark Andrews has nine touchdowns in his last 10 games behind only Ja\u2019Marr Chase (11) and Terry McLaurin (10) and more than any other tight end by three TDs. Jonnu Smith and Sam LaPorta have six TDs each.\n\n\u25ba It may be hard to swallow, but Joe Mixon isn\u2019t a must-start. The Ravens have allowed a mere 65.5 RB rushing yards per game, and only Saquon Barkley ran for more than 63 against them. Additionally, Mixon has 8.1 fantasy points or fewer in three of the last four games, despite at least 15 touches in each.\n\nSeahawks at Bears, Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba D\u2019Andre Swift hasn\u2019t scored double-digit fantasy points since Week 11 and is just RB35 in fantasy points per game since Week 9.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChargers at Patriots, Saturday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba If J.K. Dobbins returns, he\u2019s a high-risk/reward RB3. If he\u2019s out, Gus Edwards is a touchdown-reliant RB3, and I wouldn\u2019t immediately chase his Week 16 production, as he had a season-high in rushing yards and doubled his touchdown total.\n\n\u25ba The Patriots are risky, even in the backfield, as Rhamondre Stevenson has ranged anywhere from 40.0 to 82.1 RBTouch% this year. While he\u2019s more reliable when games are close or with the lead, it\u2019s hard to predict when the Patriots can accomplish such a feat, staying close with the Bills but getting blown out by the Jaguars.\n\nBroncos at Bengals, Saturday, 4:30 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba With 10.8 points, Audric Estime led the Broncos, but there are just two instances where the lead back has led the backfield in back-to-back weeks \u2014 Javonte Williams, Weeks 4 and 5, 9.0 and 13.6 fantasy points, respectively and Jaleel McLaughlin, Weeks 12 and 13, 4.4 and 8.9. You can\u2019t trust anyone.\n\nCardinals at Rams, Saturday, 8 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba I addressed the RB situation in my waiver wire column, but additionally, the Rams have only allowed RBs Alvin Kamara and Saquon Barkley big days since Week 9. It\u2019s not a smash spot for Trey Benson or Michael Carter if either is the lead.\n\n\u25ba Matthew Stafford had his first back-to-back sub-200-yard game since Weeks 8 (injured) and 11 last year. The next game? Stafford threw for 229 and four touchdowns against \u2026 the Cardinals. Now, that is coincidental, but the Cardinals are a great rebound matchup for Stafford, Puka Nacua and even Cooper Kupp.\n\nJets at Bills, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Breece Hall wasn\u2019t on the injury report all week, and he ended up with his sixth-highest RBTouch% (76.0). If Aaron Rodgers plays, business as usual, but if he\u2019s out, small downgrade to Davante Adams (volume), but Garrett Wilson\u2019s outlook changes little.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u25ba It\u2019s not just Amari Cooper you can\u2019t trust in Buffalo. You can\u2019t trust any Bills wideout, possibly even Khalil Shakir. Mack Hollins is still ahead of Keon Coleman, and Cooper is behind Dawson Knox in route involvement. Shakir had just his second sub-8 fantasy point showing since Week 7, but Week 6 saw him contained by the Jets with a 2/2/19 statline and 2.9 points.\n\nRaiders at Saints, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Even against the Saints, the list of must-start players is one: Brock Bowers. Jakobi Meyers, Alexander Mattison and Ameer Abdullah are all deeper options with a bit more upside than usual given the matchup.\n\n\u25ba As you saw against the Packers, if you attempt to start a Saints player, you\u2019re asking to get coal.\n\nColts at Giants, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The last time a team didn\u2019t have a running back hit double-digit PPR points against the Giants? Week 18 of last year. That\u2019s not only for those rostering Jonathan Taylor but also Anthony Richardson, as the Giants even let Joe Burrow and Geno Smith run for 55+ yards.\n\n\u25ba No, I didn\u2019t trust Tyrone Tracy playing through an injury, and I\u2019m sorry. The Colts are a good spot for him, which means, we\u2019ll start Tracy and watch him go 11-for-37 without scoring. Yay feetsballing!\n\nCowboys at Eagles, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Last week was Dowdle\u2019s first non 100-rushing-yards game Since Week 12, and his first non-double-digit score since Week 11. It doesn\u2019t get any easier for him, as the Eagles run defense is one of the worst matchups. Dowdle is a fringe RB2, especially if the carcass of Ezekiel Elliott is stealing goal-line carries.\n\n\u25ba If Jalen Hurts plays, fire up everyone as normal. If Kenny Pickett is under center, A.J. Brown is still a must-start, but DeVonta Smith becomes a risky WR4.\n\nPanthers at Buccaneers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Chuba Hubbard obviously had his best game since the bye. In fact, it was his best game of the season. He scored more points than the three previous games, combined. The Buccaneers have been tough, and Hubbard had 12 carries for 43 yards against them \u2014 all rushing \u2014 in Week 13. The volume is here, but so might be an RB2 finish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u25ba Jalen McMillan the last three weeks: 50.1 points (WR11) and 16.7 FPPG (WR13). You\u2019re starting him.\n\nTitans at Jaguars, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Tony Pollard still has a higher RBTouch% (54) than Tyjae Spears (46) over the last two weeks, but with Pollard not practicing, playing through injury, and game scripts, Spears has been much better, including seeing four goal-line rushes to just one for Pollard.\n\n\u25ba Brian Thomas Jr. is one of the fantasy MVPs as WR4 in FPPG since Week 11 and WR14 in FPPG on the season; he\u2019s WR6 overall.\n\nDolphins at Browns, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba If Jameis Winston plays due to Dorian Thompson-Robinson sitting, Jerry Jeudy is back to WR2 status even against the Dolphins. David Njoku is a must-start, but Elijah Moore would be a gamble with or without Cedric Tillman playing. As mentioned, the Dolphins have played the pass quite well.\n\nPackers at Vikings, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Per waivers, if Christian Watson plays, he\u2019s an appealing WR4 with more boom potential than most weeks. If he\u2019s out, Dontayvion Wicks is a fun chase for those needing the upside. Jayden Reed and Tucker Kraft are the only two worth using outside of Watson and Wicks.\n\n\u25ba T.J. Hockenson has just 5.6 FPPG on 17.7 TmTGT% over the last four games and is a man coverage matchup problem. Unfortunately, the Packers are only 23rd in Man% (22.2), which means Hockenson is in the streaming tight end conversation.\n\nFalcons at Commanders, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Drake London had his third-highest YPRR mark this year (2.68) and second-highest if you remove the Week 9 game where he left early (hip) \u2014 he\u2019s a must-start if playing. Darnell Mooney is a very strong WR3 also with his third-highest YPRR mark of the year (3.15) with Michael Penix Jr. under center.\n\n\u25ba It was ugly for Brian Robinson, but even with two fumbles \u2014 for turnovers! \u2014 Robinson had 57.1 RBTouch% and can rebound into RB2 territory against the Falcons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLions at 49ers, Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Lions run the most man \u2014 which you likely know by now \u2014 and George Kittle is much less effective against man with 1.67 YPRR compared to 3.08 against zone coverage. The good news is that Brock Purdy has 7.9 TD/ATT% against man compared to 3.0 against zone.\n\n\u25ba After last week, it might be tempting to start Deebo Samuel, and I\u2019m okay with the upside chase \u2014 plus, some fun with a last-man standing on MNF \u2014 but I\u2019m less excited for Samuel if Isaac Guerendo plays.\n\nFUN WITH RANKS\n\nIt\u2019s Christmas time! And I\u2019m gathering \u2014 and updating \u2014 all the Christmases of lists from past years into one huge Christmas.\n\nBest Christmas Movies \u2014 SINCE 2000\n\n\u201cKlaus\u201d \u2014 Origin story of Santa with a fun twist. Good animation, good feels. Top 5 all time, and possibly higher. Nicole and I watched it for the first time this year and can\u2019t recommend it enough. \u201cElf\u201d \u2014 Even if you think Will Ferrell is overrated, this is a great Christmas movie and is the source of numerous GIFs. \u201cViolent Night\u201d \u2014 John Wick is Santa \u2014 essentially \u2014 enough said! \u201cBad Santa\u201d \u2014 Con-man (Billy Bob Thorton) pretends to be Santa at a mall to rob the stores during Christmas \u2026 and yeah \u2026 pretty amusing. \u201cRed One\u201d \u2014 Hate on The Rock/this movie all you want, but it was a fun time. \u201cSurviving Christmas\u201d \u2014 Easily the most underrated Christmas movie ever. Ben Affleck is likable, James Gandolfini is the dad, plenty of laughs in a story about a guy trying to \u201cbuy a family\u201d for Christmas. \u201c8-Bit Christmas\u201d \u2014 Cheesy for sure, but if you were a \u201990s kid like me, you\u2019ll appreciate it more. \u201cSpirited\u201d \u2014 I was ready for cringe, and there is plenty, but it\u2019s also not a half-bad Christmas movie. \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever\u201d \u2014 100% a true-blue, family Christmas movie, and it doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything else. Just a good one. \u201cNutcrackers\u201d \u2014 Might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea \u2026 or eggnog. But the movie features real-life brothers (four of them) and is based somewhat on a \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d revision the middle child wrote. A bit hokey, but funny, and a good Christmas story.\n\nHonorable Mention: \u201cCarry-On\u201d \u2014 If you\u2019re counting \u201cDie Hard\u201d as a Christmas movie, then this counts. I wouldn\u2019t count either one, as they\u2019re not, but I also just wanted to poke at those people a bit.\n\nDFL: \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d \u2014 Hate me all you want, but I can\u2019t stand it.\n\nPre-2000 Greats: \u201cA Christmas Vacation\u201d (all-time great), \u201cHome Alone\u201d (another all-time great), \u201cThe Muppet Christmas Carol\u201d (can watch this every year), \u201cThe Santa Clause\u201d (the sequels are huge drop-offs, but this is a classic now), \u201cThe Nightmare before Christmas\u201d (though, Halloween movie?), \u201cScrooged\u201d (modern-day Christmas Carol).\n\nBest Christmas TV Episodes and Specials\n\n\u201cDuckTales: How Santa Stole Christmas\u201d (also, \u201cLast Christmas\u201d) \u2014 You had to know I\u2019d put this at the top \u2026 and no, it\u2019s probably not my true No. 1, but this is for the travesty of canceling the show, and I\u2019ll be watching this with my niece and nephew anyway. But, turns out, Scrooge and Santa are old friends, then enemies. Scrooge helped start Christmas, and\u2026 watch it! \u201cFriends: The One with the Holiday Armadillo\u201d \u2014 Ross wants to teach his son about Hanukkah, dresses as an armadillo, Chandler shows up as Santa and Joey surprises as Superman \u2026 for the Easter Bunny\u2019s funeral. \u201cFuturama: Xmas Story\u201d \u2014 John Goodman guest voices as an evil robot Santa who murders people on Christmas. Plus, Zoidberg is the hero\u2026 WUT?! And it is another seed in the series-long romance story of Fry and Leela. \u201cSeinfeld: The Strike (Festivus)\u201d \u2014 Festivus for the rest of us! Airing of grievances! Can\u2019t end Festivus until George\u2019s dad is pinned! Two-face! Kramer working in the bagel shop! There is just so much greatness. \u201cCommunity: Abed\u2019s Uncontrollable Christmas\u201d \u2014 Stop-motion/claymation style special with everything \u201cCommunity\u201d and old Christmas special rolled into one. \u201cThe Office: Christmas Party\u201d \u2014 Another show that includes an underlying romance story piece, and then the fighting over Michael trying to buy Ryan\u2019s love (with an iPod), all thanks to Michael turning it into a Yankee Swap from Secret Santa because he hates his gift. \u201cSupernatural: A Very Supernatural Christmas\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m going to miss this show. Basically, Sam and Dean are hunting down anti-Claus, not too different from \u201cFuturama\u201d\u2018s Santa, who is taking humans as sacrifices \u2013 few shows balance humor, thrills and the feels like Supernatural did. \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine: Yippie Kayak\u201d \u2014 Jake forgot Boyle\u2019s gift, Jake gets Gina to help find a gift but Boyle comes along when they end up in the middle of a robbery with a hostage situation, and Jake is giddy to recreate \u201cDie Hard.\u201d \u201cSouth Park: Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\u201d \u2014 In a theme that still holds up today, \u201cSouth Park\u201d wants to eliminate Christmas to be politically indifferent. Mr. Hankey, theme song and all, saves Christmas and becomes a recurring \u201ccharacter.\u201d \u201cA Charlie Brown Christmas\u201d \u2014 Kinda falls in the middle of a TV special and movie. Iconic cartoon, songs, characters, etc.\n\nHonorable Mention\n\n\u201cHow I Met Your Mother: How Lily Stole Christmas\u201d \u2014 Ted is telling Marshall to get over Lily, saying, \u201cYou gotta get over that Grinch.\u201d But the truth, from Future Ted, is that he said something else, and it happens again but the gift Marshall gets Lily makes everything right.\n\n\u201cChuck: Chuck Versus Santa Claus\u201d \u2014 Fugitive crashes into the Buy More, Sarah sneaks in to rescue Chuck, who ends up shooting Mauser (Fulcrum) to protect Chuck, which makes him think Sarah is a murderer \u2026 not exactly what you would think for a Christmas episode, but if you watched \u201cChuck\u201d and know the episode, you know why it\u2019s here.\n\nBest Christmas Desserts\n\nEggnog cookies/meltaways \u2014 oh.my.Santa! If you haven\u2019t had these, make it a point to change that this Christmas! Cream cheese cookies \u2014 trying to describe these doesn\u2019t do them service\u2026 drool-worthy (#CheckTheLink for recipe). Cinnamon roll anything \u2014 Though, try this cinnamon roll apple pie. Gingerbread swiss roll \u2014 I\u2019m not a fan of gingerbread cookies, but this swiss roll? Yum! Snowball cookies \u2014 Filled with chopped nuts (I usually had walnuts or pecans). Sugar cookie cut-outs \u2014 not the most delicious, but the must-have cookie of Christmas given the holiday shapes, red and green sugar, etc. Snickerdoodle \u2014 similar to the chocolate chip cookie, a classically great cookie that some people only have during the holidays, which is strange. Red and Green M&M chocolate chip cookies \u2014 the wonderful classic made festive with the M&M colors. Rugelach \u2014 my mom has made these for as long as I can remember, and they\u2019re vastly underrated (and yes, I had to look up the spelling). Jelly thumbprints \u2014 you can pretend you\u2019re being a bit healthy with some fruit.\n\nBest Christmas Songs\n\n\u201cThe Christmas Song\u201d (Nat King Cole) \u2014 The King of Christmas and the king of Christmas songs. \u201cIt\u2019s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year\u201d (Andy Williams) \u2014 Another song that is all fun and enjoyment, and I could listen to it 10 times in an hour and not be sick of it (moved up a few spots because I\u2019m just not sick of it this year). \u201cAll I Want for Christmas is You\u201d (Mariah Carey) \u2014 You can act like you don\u2019t love it. You can pretend Carey isn\u2019t amazing. You can say it isn\u2019t the best original Christmas song in decades before it and since. But it would all be pure lies! \u201cJingle Bell Rock\u201d (Bobby Helms) \u2014 Arguably one of the most iconic Christmas song intros. You know immediately what\u2019s about to be played, and a smile comes with it. \u201cA Holly Jolly Christmas\u201d (Burl Ives) \u2014 Worlds better than the Christmas special this comes from and its song, \u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\u201d This should rank higher on everyone\u2019s list. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s the personification of Christmas joy in a song. And honestly, \u201cRudolph\u201d (the song) is short and repetitive. \u201cSanta Claus is Coming to Town\u201d (The Jackson 5) \u2014 Plenty of versions to choose from, but this one is undeniably the best with the talent of the Jacksons and it being a Christmas song sung by kids. \u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u201d (Frank Sinatra) \u2014 Not every song has to be peppy and about pure fun. First off, Frank Sinatra might have the best male voice of all time (I own his \u201cBest of\u201d collection), and second, this song warms the heart (was seventh, but I\u2019m feeling peppier this year). \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d (Brenda Lee) \u2014 Back to the pep, one of the all-time best Christmas movies had a great scene with this song \u2026 \u201cHome Alone.\u201d \u201cSleigh Ride/Winter Wonderland\u201d (Dolly Parton) \u2014 \u201cWinter Wonderland\u201d is quality on its own, as is \u201cSleigh Ride.\u201d How do you make them better? Make them two songs in one and a rare Christmas song lasting nearly four minutes. Kudos, Dolly. \u201cChristmas (Baby Please Come Home)\u201d (Mariah Carey) \u2014 The original is good (Darlene Love), but Mariah Carey makes everything better. Honestly, tell me one song that couldn\u2019t be improved by Carey singing it.\n\nMOAR! Honorable Mentions, and Ones You Don\u2019t Admit You Like\n\n\u201cChristmas in Hollis\u201d (Run-DMC) \u2013 It\u2019s one of those songs you never turn off if it comes on, always start bobbing to and even try to sing along, but it\u2019s doesn\u2019t really have the loop factor, and if we\u2019re honest, very few people know all of the words.\n\n\u201cHere Comes Santa Claus,\u201d \u201cFrosty the Snowman\u201d (Gene Autry)\n\n\u201cWhite Christmas\u201d (Bing Crosby) \u2013 A true classic.

            "article_content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe generative AI landscape has morphed into a high-stakes battleground in 2024, with an army of upstarts storming the castle once ruled by OpenAI.\n\nEveryone and their tech-savvy grandma seems to be vying for a piece of the AI pie, cooking up language models, agentic AIs, image generators, and even an AI meme coin shiller or two.\n\nThe benchmarks are changing faster than our human ability to keep up. Barely a week goes by without some shiny new toy hitting the market\u2014an updated LLM here, a turbocharged image generator there, or a next-gen AI flexing some exotic training technique.\n\nBut here at Decrypt, we've rolled up our sleeves and tried them all.\n\nWe've kicked the tires, pushed the buttons, and gotten deep inside the inner workings and the outputs provided by the most popular AI models\u2014and some that are not so well-known.\n\nNow that it's clear that OpenAI isn't the only sheriff in town, we've compiled a list of the cream of the crop\u2014the generative AI models that have wowed us, befuddled us, and occasionally made us spit out our coffee.\n\nChatbots\n\nA chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users. It uses natural language processing and artificial intelligence to understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses. Usually, people confuse chatbots with LLMs, or large language models.\n\nToday, chatbots are a bit more complex, with capabilities that extend beyond text generation. They can now browse the web, generate and understand images, talk to the user, etc.\n\nHere is our list of the best chatbots you should try:\n\nGold medal: OpenAI's ChatGPT\n\nChatGPT offers a wide array of features at $20/month, including custom agent creation with natural language, a clean interface, web search, and multiple models (reasoning, writing, vision, voice, and image generation).\n\nSilver medal: Anthropic's Claude\n\nA superior LLM with an intuitive UI featuring split-screen artifacts for reasoning and code generation, Claude supports million-token context and custom agents. However, it lacks web search and image generation and often faces capacity issues, forcing users to switch to a weaker model or generate \u201cconcise\u201d shorter answers. Because of this, it cannot be the best just yet.\n\nBronze medal: Mistral AI\u2019s LeChat\n\nThis free platform is powered by Mistral Large, featuring top-tier Flux image generation and superior web search\u2014the best, in our opinion, even beating SearchGPT. It supports document/image understanding and open-source AI agents, though text quality trails competitors. However, the Mistral Large LLM isn\u2019t as strong as its competitors, making it ideal for power users willing to trade text quality for features.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Meta AI, Gemini (from Google\u2019s AI studio, not the main site), Hugging Chat, Reka, Grok-2\n\nLarge language models\n\nA large language model or LLM is an artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. You can see it as a glorified autocomplete. They are designed to predict what the most likely token (think about words, though it\u2019s an inaccurate comparison) is in a group.\n\nThe result is natural text that feels human because, well, it resembles what humans would do.\n\nHere is our list of the best LLMs to date:\n\nBest generalist: OpenAI's GPT-4o\n\nBalances creative writing, coding, and reasoning with a customizable \"Canvas\" feature, though its style can feel predictable. The latest version (from November 20) has also achieved the top spot in the LLM Arena with an ELO score of 1,366, beating an experimental version of Google Gemini released on November 21.\n\nBest for writing: Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n\nMatches or exceeds GPT-4o in many areas with more creative, human-like output, though it's prone to hallucination.\n\nBest for storytelling: Longwriter\n\nGenerates 10,000+ word stories within minutes. Do we need to say more?\n\nMost versatile: Meta's Llama-3.1\n\nThe leading open-source model with extensive customization, LoRA creation, and fine-tuning options, available in sizes from 7 billion to 405 billion parameters so users can run it on their local machines or cloud servers depending on their needs. Nvidia developed a customized version named \"Nemotron,\" which made some waves in the community and is worth checking out.\n\nBiggest letdown: Reflection Llama-3.1 70B\n\nAnnounced with high expectations, the model claimed to beat GPT-4o thanks to its embedded Chain of Thought. It ended up being a major fiasco with fake benchmarks, hidden API calls to Claude AI, and a major controversy.\n\nImage generators\n\nAn image generator is essentially a model that gets a text input and provides an output associated with that text input. So, for example, you say, \u201cGreen horse with a dragon face,\u201d and the model will generate a photo of a green horse with a dragon face. You can also input something like \u201cbusty waifu,\u201d but that is not what they are for.\n\nThese are some of the best image generators currently available\n\nBest generalist: Flux\n\nFlux dominates the latest generation of AI models with substantial customization, LoRA/ControlNet support, and text generation capabilities. It requires powerful hardware, but shows a characteristic style with extreme bokeh and slack skin detail that users are still trying to tackle.\n\nIt comes in three flavors: Pro (closed-source, the most potent model), Dev (noncommercial license), and Schnell (an open-source, distilled version). All three offer excellent image generation capabilities, and the ceiling will go higher if fine-tunes are considered.\n\nBest for realism: Recraft v3\n\nDelivers unmatched realism, offering versatile presets and better value than proprietary alternatives like MidJourney.\n\nIt has a free tier that offers the same quality\u2014though Recraft owns generations.\n\nBest for anime: MidJourney Niji\n\nUnrivaled quality for anime-style images; a Stable Diffusion fine-tuning is a secondary option.\n\nMost versatile: Stable Diffusion 3.5\n\nStable Diffusion 3.5 is a major improvement over SD3 with better licensing, detailed output, and add-on support.\n\nIt is more resource-efficient than Flux for fine-tuning and is a full model\u2014unlike Flux Schnell, which is a distilled version\u2014making it the best pick for custom models.\n\nHowever, it came out a little bit late and has been overshadowed by Flux\u2019s popularity.\n\nBiggest Letdown: SD 3 Medium\n\nEveryone expected this new model to be the new King of Image Generators, beating SDXL and every other model. It ended up being a poor model, infamous for its horrible license and horrific aberrations when trying to generate people on grass.\n\nVideo generators\n\nVideo generators take image generation one step further. They generate each frame and use it as input to generate the following one with image consistency and high prompt adherence.\n\nThis is still a work in progress, and models can only generate a few seconds of video. Below is a list of some of the best ones you can try.\n\nBest generalist: Kling\n\nRapidly improving the Chinese model, outperforming Sora in some cases. Supports face model training, and consistently generates high-quality scenes showing a major versatility in terms of styles, realism, and camera movement.\n\nBest contender: Runway Gen 3\n\nPioneering generative video app with solid environmental understanding, but struggles with fast-paced scenes.\n\nBest for storytelling: ShowRunner\n\nWe cannot tell you a lot about this one. However, in confidential testing, it has shown immense potential.\n\nBest open-source: Genmo Mochi 1\n\nIt's a great release that beats competitors like Rhymes Allegro and Stable Video Diffusion with superior realism and frame consistency.\n\nBiggest letdown: OpenAI Sora\n\nAnnounced with high expectations as a revolutionary \u201cworld model\u201d beyond any video generation, it remains unavailable today with underwhelming leaked outputs.\n\nHonorable mention: Google Veo\n\nGoogle's Veo was released on December 3. We haven't tested it, but the generations shared by Google look pretty nice. Of course, we're on the waiting list to test the model, and you'll be the first to know our thoughts as soon as we get access.\n\nMusic generators\n\nJust like video generators, music generators create songs. It\u2019s different from audio generators, however, since the outputs are more specialized to melodic outputs that are not noise, plain voices, or audio effects.\n\nUsers can rely on a separate LLM to generate the lyrics of a song or input lyrics manually, and set a few parameters like the style of the song, and then the model will output relevant music from scratch.\n\nThese are the best two\u2014plus an open-source alternative.\n\nBest generalist: Suno v4\n\nExcels in vocals and lyrics, style diversity, and long-form consistency. Its predecessor, Suno v3.5, is not free but remains a strong alternative.\n\nBest contender: Udio\n\nSuno\u2019s biggest rival. It delivers impressive composition accuracy, nearly rivaling Suno v4 in vocals. Some generations surpass Suno v3 in subjective style.\n\nBest open-source: Stable Audio 2\n\nThe open-source scene is not doing a lot in this area. Stable Audio 2 seems to be the best model, but lags behind closed-source competitors in every field. Meta\u2019s AudioCraft and MusicGen are alternatives, but far from industry-leading. Fine-tuners have not paid attention, and usually, they are the people behind the cherry on top that makes open-source models so great.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

We have covered the top 5 news headlines from the week. Check it out.\n\nAbu Dhabi Plans to Launch the First Flying Taxi Service by 2025\n\nAbu Dhabi might become the first city to launch a flying taxi service by 2025. This project will be a collaboration between Abu Dhabi and Archer Aviation \u2013 a US-based company specializing in designing and developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.\n\nThe flying taxi service will link various \u201cvertiports\u201d across the city. The starter model is called Midnight, which is a vertical takeoff and landing model. This means it will lift off the ground directly like a helicopter (unlike an airplane that requires a long runway). Each model will be able to carry up to 4 passengers.\n\nSpeaking of the benefits, the biggest perk is that flying taxis will cut down travel time by up to 80%. Even the starter models can go up to a speed of 240 km/hr which means a route that usually takes up to 1hr by car can be completed within 10-20 mins by these flying taxis.\n\nNot to mention, these taxis will be much more eco-friendly and significantly reduce traffic congestion on the streets.\n\nThe project is expected to go into a trial phase soon with commercial services fully launching by the end of 2025.\n\nWhy Abu Dhabi?\n\nThe reason why Abu Dhabi was chosen to be the first city to lay down the path for flying taxis is its unique geography. The city consists of over 200 islands, making air travel the perfect alternative to traditional road travel for citizens.\n\nThe city authorities have also been very helpful. A project of this level and scale requires a lot of support for developing the right infrastructure such as the \u201cvertiports\u201d and the traffic management system, which the Abu Dhabi authorities have provided throughout.\n\nYou Can Now Reach ChatGPT on WhatsApp\n\nOpenAI has rolled out a new feature that will allow users to reach out to ChatGPT over call or Whatsapp text.\n\nIn a livestream hosted by the OpenAI team, it revealed that the new features were created by the team within weeks. The chat option is available worldwide for all of the 2.7 billion Whatsapp users but the calling feature is only limited to US users for now.\n\nThey can reach out to the tool at 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478). Making calls doesn\u2019t require an Open AI account and the first 15 minutes of calling every month is completely free!\n\nThere are some limitations as of now. For example, you cannot add OpenAI to any group chats. Similarly, its knowledge base for Whatsapp users is limited to information dating back to September 2021. It cannot help you with anything that happened beyond that.\n\nHence, the company has warned that users seeking a more personalized experience and advanced assistance should stick to using ChatGPT directly through their accounts.\n\nIncreasing accessibility to the tool has been a primary goal of the company since day one. And what better way to do that than leveraging the most popular messaging app in the world?\n\nWe care a lot about continuing to reduce barriers so that more people can try out AI and see what it can do for them. \u2013 Antonia Woodford, product manager\n\nThere\u2019s also the obvious motive of enticing new users to try out the paid versions of ChatGPT. But the good news is the company has promised not to use the call conversations to train the chatbot.\n\nTrump Is Rethinking TikTok\u2019s Impending Ban\n\nThe popular social media platform has a few weeks left until it\u2019s banned in the US forever. This ban stems from a bill passed earlier this year that forced the company to cut ties with its parent company (a Chinese company called ByteDance) or risk getting banned in the US.\n\nThis is because US regulators are worried about China using its influence on TikTok to spy on US citizens. And given how sour the relationship between the two countries has turned right now, it\u2019s natural for the US to keep its guard up around China. Hence, the bill.\n\nTikTok naturally opposed the bill, even challenging it legally but to no avail. The ban was final and was expected to come into force in January.\n\nBut like a beacon of hope, Trump won the presidential elections and announced that he might keep TikTok around for a little while longer.\n\nTrump said that during his election campaign, he went on TikTok and the results were beyond imagination. He got billions of views which in turn delivered him a massive young user base.\n\n\u201cMaybe we have to keep this sucker around for a little while,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also argued that banning TikTok will primarily benefit Meta and its social media platforms \u2013 Facebook and Instagram. Both of these apps already have a lot of influence on the public, banning TikTok which is the only strong rival at the moment will further strengthen their monopoly.\n\nHowever, preventing the ban won\u2019t be as easy as it sounds. The ban enjoyed rare bipartisan support, so even with all the influence Trump has, repealing it through congressional vote seems difficult.\n\nThe best way forward for both TikTok and Trump would be to approach the Supreme Court and convince it to rule in their favor.\n\nMeta-Owned WhatsApp Wins the Pegasus Spyware Case Against NSO Group\n\nA US Judge ruled in favor of WhatsApp, stating that the Israeli commercial spyware vendor NSO Group indeed breached laws (both federal laws and WhatsApp\u2019s terms of services) by using WhatsApp to inflect devices with the Pegasus spyware.\n\nThe group infected a total of 1,400 users. Out of these 1,400, there were at least 100 human rights defenders, politicians, diplomats, journalists, and government officials.\n\nThe historic ruling was announced by a Northern California federal judge Phyllis Hamiltonon Friday, five years after the lawsuit was originally filed.\n\nWhatsapp claimed that the group exploited a vulnerability in its audio-calling feature. The group readily agreed to this claim, that it might have reverse-engineered/decompiled the Whatsapp software. However, its main argument in the case was whether it did so before agreeing to the terms of services of the app.\n\nThe judge responded that it is common sense for the group to accept the terms of services before accessing the app. There\u2019s no other way around.\n\nThe group also argued that Pegasus is actually a helpful software and has previously helped law enforcement authorities fight crime. But this time around, it failed to produce the documents the court asked for.\n\nThis includes internal communication and its source code. In short, the group couldn\u2019t prove that its actions were lawful. Hence it will be treated as an attack on the privacy of the affected users.\n\nThe group didn\u2019t make any further comments but Meta is rejoiced to hear this verdict. A spokesperson said that this ruling should act as a warning to other spyware makers that their illegal activities won\u2019t be spared.\n\nBiden Launched a New Probe Into Chinese Chips Trade, Will Hand It Off to Trump\n\nOn Monday, the Biden administration announced that it was launching a last-minute investigation into legacy Chinese semiconductors that might be breaking competition laws.\n\nThe investigation will be carried out under Section 301 of the US Trade Act and initially focus on the so-called \u201cfoundational\u201d semiconductors which power everything starting from household appliances to telecom equipment and defense systems.\n\nIf the investigation finds China guilty of breaking competition laws, there will be severe consequences including stricter restrictions and higher tariffs on all kinds of chips imported from China.\n\nSpeaking about the same, the US Trade Representative\u2019s office said that China has a habit of using non-market practices to target the chip industry and establish its dominance in it. Such behavior is extremely harmful to the competition and creates dangerous dependencies in the global supply chain.\n\nThis is the US\u2019s latest blow to China\u2019s technical industry. Up until now, most of its attention was on the supply of advanced chips from the US to China that might help the latter build powerful AI systems.\n\nThe government also imposed higher tariffs on electrical vehicles imported from China and there\u2019s also the impending ban on China\u2019s biggest social media platform TikTok.\n\nOverall, the Biden administration hasn\u2019t been very kind to China. But now that Trump will take over the White House, the responsibility of this probe will go into his hands so we are yet to see how he handles the US ties with China.\n\nAdd Techreport to Your Google News Feed Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips.

            "article_content": "New Delhi, Dec 26 (PTI) As technological advancements like AI, machine learning and precision medicine revolutionise drug discovery, manufacturing and patient care, Indian pharmaceutical industry is set for a 'profound transformation' in 2025 with innovation, wider global access and improvement in quality becoming key themes for the future.\n\nThe industry, which is expected to grow nearly two-fold to around USD 130 billion in size by 2030, is looking to take advantage of conducive policies, demographic and digital talent, in making India play a pivotal role in advancing global health for all.\n\nCurrently accounting for around 20 per cent of the overall generic drug sales globally, the Indian pharma industry is focussing on research excellence and innovation in order to position the country as a global hub for high-quality, affordable pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"The Indian pharma market is expected to move up to USD 120-130 billion by 2030 from the current size of USD 58 billion. Initiatives in terms of quality, innovation and wider global reach will help the Indian pharma sector to realise the potential,\" according to Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) Secretary General Sudarshan Jain.\n\nGiven the conducive policies and the advantage of demographic and digital talent, India will play a pivotal role in advancing global health for all in years to come, he added.\n\nIPA represents 23 leading research-based Indian pharmaceutical companies like Sun Pharma, Cipla, and Dr Reddy's Laboratories, among others.\n\nJain said innovation will continue to be a major focus for the industry going forward.\n\nHe noted that the government is expected to soon announce the operational details of the Promotion of Research & Innovation Programme which would also spur innovation.\n\nElaborating on the initiatives lined up in the private sector, he said that leading companies are increasing their focus on specialty portfolios and diversifying into higher-value drugs.\n\n\"Additionally, the industry is set to make notable progress in areas such as CAR-T cell therapy, mRNA vaccines, and the development of complex molecules, which hold immense potential for driving future growth,\" Jain said.\n\nBesides, the patent expiries of blockbuster biologics by 2025 present a significant growth avenue in the global biosimilars market, he stated.\n\nSimilarly, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) Director General Anil Matai said the industry is set for a profound transformation in 2025.\n\nTechnological advancements like AI, machine learning and precision medicine are set to revolutionise drug discovery, manufacturing and patient care, he said.\n\nOPPI represents research-based pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Novartis and Merck, in India.\n\nBesides, strengthened regulatory frameworks will enable the swift adoption of innovative therapies while prioritising patient safety, Matai said.\n\n\"A focus on research excellence and innovation will position India as a global hub for high-quality, affordable pharmaceuticals. Collaboration between policymakers, academia and industry stakeholders will address unmet medical needs, particularly in underserved regions,\" he stated.\n\nAlso, adherence to Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) will uphold ethical standards, fostering trust and transparency across the healthcare ecosystem, Matai stated.\n\nReflecting on the year gone by, Jain said 2024 has been a year of building on a robust foundation with sustainable growth and thrust on simplifying regulations and harmonisation with global standards.\n\nThe PLI (production linked incentive) schemes have started seeing dividends with the launch of greenfield projects for the production of Penicillin G and Clavulanic acid, among others.\n\nMatai noted that the notification of the Patent (Amendment) Rules 2024, waivers for Phase 3 clinical trials for certain categories of drugs already approved in well-regulated markets, and the much-awaited Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) with European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states reflect India's progressive strides toward creating a dynamic, globally competitive pharmaceutical sector that is driven by innovation.\n\nCommenting on the healthcare segment, Fortis Healthcare MD & CEO Ashutosh Raghuvanshi said that the hospital market is projected to grow from nearly USD 99 billion in 2023 to an estimated USD 194 billion by 2032.\n\n\"Our sector is not only expanding but evolving to meet the diverse needs of our population. This year has been particularly significant as hospitals have emerged as the leading recipients of foreign direct investment within the healthcare landscape,\" he added.\n\nLooking ahead, the industry must focus on several key trends that will shape the future of healthcare in India, Raghuvanshi said.\n\n\"The ageing population will drive demand for specialised geriatric care, while a growing emphasis on preventive care will shift our focus from merely treating illness to promoting wellness,\" he stated.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and telemedicine will enhance diagnostic precision and operational efficiency, ultimately improving patient outcomes, he added.\n\nCommenting on the medtech sector, Poly Medicure MD Himanshu Baid said it is imperative for companies to step up their investments in R&D and innovation to sustain growth momentum.\n\n\"The future belongs to those who can develop transformative technologies that address the healthcare needs of a dynamic and diverse world. With initiatives like the new medical devices scheme and a favourable regulatory environment providing the necessary foundation, India is well-positioned to expand its influence globally,\" he added.\n\nAs the market is expected to reach USD 50 billion by FY30, the med-tech industry's growth story reflects the power of collaboration and self-reliance, he added.\n\nMetropolis Healthcare Promoter and Executive Chairperson Ameera Shah said as the diagnostics industry progresses from USD 13 billion in FY23 towards an expected USD 25 billion by FY28, it is fuelled by increasing awareness of preventive healthcare, an aging population, and broader insurance coverage.\n\nHowever, the path forward demands a strategic focus on technology, accessibility, and collaboration, she added.\n\nThe future of diagnostics lies in embracing genomics, digitalisation and technologies such as AI, machine learning, and data analytics, Shah said."

Reuters File\n\nThe Israeli military relaxed its rules of engagement at the start of the Gaza war, allowing commanders to order attacks on targets despite an increased risk of civilian casualties.\n\nAccording to a report by the New York Times on Thursday, after the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas-led gunmen, the military empowered mid-ranking officers to strike a variety of military targets, even if it could result in the deaths of up to 20 civilians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis order permitted the military to target lower-ranking militants in their homes, surrounded by family and neighbors, rather than only when they were alone outside, the report added.\n\nThe report was based on interviews with over 100 soldiers and officials, including more than 25 individuals involved in selecting and vetting targets.\n\nThe New York Times claimed that the Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe report said the military acknowledged that the rules of engagement had changed after October 7 but said its forces had \u201cconsistently been employing means and methods that adhere to the rules of law\u201d.\n\nThe Hamas-led attack on communities around the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023 killed 1,200 people and saw more than 250 taken as hostages into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIsrael\u2019s ground and air campaign in response has killed more than 45,000 people and wounded more than 107,000, according to Gaza health ministry figures, displaced most of the 2.3 million population and laid waste to much of the coastal enclave.\n\nIn addition to raising the number of civilian casualties that could be risked in a single attack, the New York Times said the military removed a limit on the cumulative number of civilians that its strikes could put at risk each day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a few occasions, the military high command approved strikes that they knew would put as many as 100 civilian lives at risk, the newspaper said.\n\nIt said the military \u201coften relied on a crude statistical model to assess the risk of civilian harm\u201d, mainly depending on estimates of cellphone usage rather than extensive surveillance of a single building.\n\nFrom November 2023 onward, the rules were tightened, including by halving the number of civilian casualties that could be risked in attacks on low-level targets, the newspaper said. It added that the rules remained far more permissive than before the war.\n\nWith inputs from agencies\n\nAdvertisement"

            "article_content": "The share of electric vehicles in T\u00fcrkiye's auto market is predicted to further increase in the upcoming year to account for nearly a third of it, according to a chief executive of a major auto distributor company in the country on Wednesday.\n\nElectric vehicles are estimated to make up 30% of T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s auto market in 2025, as increasingly more EV models of well-known car brands enter the country and the domestic EV brand Togg boosts its production capacity, Ali Bilalo\u011flu, CEO of the Turkish auto exporter and distributor Do\u011fu\u015f Otomotiv told Anadolu Agency (AA).\n\nBilalo\u011flu stated EV and hybrid sales accounted for 27% of the total Turkish auto market this year, led by the entry of Chinese brands into the market and the surge in the number of models over the same period.\n\n\"This year, we launched at least one EV model for almost every brand we distribute, representing all Volkswagen Group brands and two or three more EV models for most of our brands,\" he said, noting that the expectations that number of EV models the firm distributes from the group would be 20-25 in the coming years.\n\nBilalo\u011flu estimated that the end-year auto sales, excluding heavy commercial vehicles, will reach 1.2 million units this year, as January-November sales totaled nearly 1.1 million units, close to the record sales of 2023.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye's automotive sector has endured a challenging but transformative year as shares of electric vehicles and hybrids were on the rise, and the demand was widely undaunted despite a monetary tightening drive since mid-2023.\n\nIn July, Chinese EV giant BYD agreed on a $1 billion investment deal with Turkish authorities to set up a production facility in the western province of Manisa, which is also seen as one of the key elements that could contribute to the further boom of EVs in the country.\n\nAt the same time, negotiations are nearing completion with another Chinese automaker, Chery, for a manufacturing facility within the country, a senior official said earlier this month.\n\nBilalo\u011flu, on the other hand, stated that the Turkish auto sector develops every year, and the country\u2019s demographic structure influences the market.\n\nHe said that the duration extension of EU General Safety Regulation (GSR) II, the increase in the number limit of vehicles sold without the special consumption tax (\u00d6TV) and the speculations that the \u00d6TV would increase led to the high sales this year.\n\n\"Like other developed and industrialized countries with large economies like that of T\u00fcrkiye\u2019s, we observe that tax policies to ensure predictability of the market are more stable and do not change during the year,\" he noted.\n\nBilalo\u011flu stated that the turbulent and complicated period the world is in impacts energy prices and energy-dependent sectors such as the automotive industry, which may lead to price hikes in the auto market in upcoming years. At the same time, high interest rates may deter investors.\n\nYet, he said what is important here is \"how stable we will remain and how sustainable growth we can achieve.\"\n\n\"In that sense, we see that a very successful policy is being implemented. In economic and political terms, there are positive developments such as the decline in inflation and the decrease in the current account deficit,\" he noted.\n\nReminding that the work of Chinese brands to establish production facilities would be concluded soon, Bilalo\u011flu said: \"I think Togg will also increase its production capacity. In this case, I predict that the electric vehicle market share will increase to 30%, provided that the current \u00d6TV conditions do not change.\"\n\n\"As Do\u011fu\u015f Otomotiv, we also established a company in 2024, D-Charge. We currently have approximately 335 sockets in 27 provinces. Next year, this will increase to 48 provinces, and we will have 670 sockets,\" he concluded."

            "article_content": "Boulder County, Colorado CNN \u2014\n\nGrass fires aren\u2019t out of the ordinary here in the high desert foothills, so Allison Bequette wasn\u2019t terribly surprised when one forced her and other drivers on a detour.\n\nWhat was striking to her, however, was the sheer intensity and size of the flames. \u201cAs tall as a house,\u201d she recalled.\n\nBut on this second to last day of 2021, which was yet another in a long line of unseasonably dry ones in the region, hurricane-force winds shot down the mountain and whipped up those flames into a \u201csuburban firestorm,\u201d a deadly, raging inferno that ultimately would consume more than 1,000 houses, a hotel and several other businesses in communities southeast of Boulder.\n\nBequette\u2019s home of nearly 30 years was among them.\n\nThe Marshall Fire caused more than $2 billion in damages, making it the costliest wildfire in Colorado, a state whose purple mountain majesties have long combatted untamed and devastating blazes.\n\nWhile wildland-urban interface fires account for a small share of fires overall (although are becoming increasingly common), the aftershocks of the Marshall Fire were all too similar to what\u2019s ensued from other disasters and extreme weather events: It not only laid bare existing inequities \u2014 it exacerbated them.\n\nAllison Bequette poses in her home on November 13, 2024. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThree years later, hundreds of those homes have been rebuilt, most ballooning in size and value.\n\nOn Bequette\u2019s former property in Louisville now sits a house twice the size of her comparatively modest tri-level: a six-bedroom, five-bathroom, 4,123-square-foot home that sold for $1.45 million earlier this year, Boulder County property records show. That\u2019s 53% higher than the median home sales price of $947,500 for the past 365 days in Louisville, according to Jon Hatch, a Realtor with Compass Boulder, citing data from IRES MLS and REcolorado.\n\nIn 2023, Louisville\u2019s median home sales price was $778,000, he noted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very common pattern that we see, that homes are now bigger or fancier,\u201d said Deserai Anderson Crow, a University of Colorado Denver professor who has researched crises and disasters such as the Marshall Fire, Covid-19 pandemic, and the 2013 floods in Boulder County. \u201cNot only does that change the nature of a community, it also changes the nature of the housing stock and affordability. And having a lot of fancy houses in a community tends to raise the value (and property taxes and insurance) of surrounding houses, even if they aren\u2019t fancy.\u201d\n\n\u2018It turned into a free-for-all\u2019\n\nSoaring housing costs are old hat in Colorado, especially in and around the city of Boulder.\n\nFrom the 1970s until just recently, the idyllic college town and business hub that\u2019s highly decorated with scores of \u201cbest of\u201d honors, had in place anti-growth restrictions that sent home affordability rocketing out of reach. Residents and commuters spilled out into neighboring communities, (such as the fire-affected Louisville and Superior) which also continued to grow increasingly desirable on their own and saw rising home prices as a result.\n\nBequette, a former public school teacher and a retired pottery studio manager and instructor, is among a long list of longtime residents who did not \u2014 or could not afford to \u2014 return home and rebuild. A Colorado Division of Insurance study found that only 8% of affected homeowners had full guaranteed replacement coverage.\n\n\u201cI never did belong there,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a teacher, I never could have afforded to live in that neighborhood. It just so happened that through being married and divorced and all that, I ended up with the mortgage.\u201d\n\nOn January 5, 2022, Allison Bequette went to her house's site in Louisville, Colorado, for the first time after the fire with her daughter (pictured), who grew up in that house. Courtesy Allison Bequette\n\nIn her case, she was among at least 19 others who sold their properties for under $375,000 (sums often less than their original purchase values), according to a CNN review of property records. The buyer, California-based Homebound Technologies, then constructed substantially larger new builds that are selling for upward of $1.4 million.\n\nHomebound officials did not return multiple emails and calls from CNN.\n\nBequette was not uninsured but said the full amount of her payout wasn\u2019t enough to rebuild the same home in the same place. The amount she was insured for would\u2019ve allowed her to build a home that was less than half the size of the 2,100-square-foot house she had before.\n\n\u201cIt turned into a free-for-all,\u201d she said of the homes built in her neighborhood after the fire. \u201cThey\u2019re three and four stories tall; can you imagine my little 1,000-square-foot (rebuilt) house in the middle of that? I just didn\u2019t belong there.\u201d\n\nBequette since relocated to southern Colorado, where she now has a house (and a little pottery studio) on a small plot of land.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to move, just got to keep going,\u201d she said.\n\nDeepening disparities, increasing NIMBYism\n\nHousing has become increasingly unaffordable across the US, with the pandemic and subsequent burst in inflation making matters even worse. But the crux of the problem is a supply-and-demand one that\u2019s intensified since the financial crisis of 2008: There just aren\u2019t enough homes available for purchase.\n\nAnd when disaster strikes, that deficit can deepen and ongoing disparities can widen, said Crow, the University of Colorado Denver professor.\n\nDisaster recovery played heavily into the formation of Homebound, founded after the 2017 Tubbs Fire in California with the premise of using technology to work with affected homeowners to speed up the permitting and building process and cut through the thick, red tape following a disaster to quickly bring more homes back on the market.\n\nA home is being constructed in the hills where all the homes were destroyed during the 2017 Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, California, on December 7, 2022. Melina Mara/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nHomebound since has expanded into buying and selling properties in states such as California, Colorado, Florida and Texas.\n\n\u201cIf you rebuild your house but nobody around you rebuilds your neighborhood is worse off,\u201d Homebound founder and CEO Nicole Pechet told CBS Colorado in 2022. \u201cIf we could help accelerate the rebuild of the entire community, not only would it mean the community gets back faster, but also the more volume we\u2019re building at a given time the better pricing we can get for our homeowners we\u2019re building with. So, it really benefits everyone.\u201d\n\nWhile the new builds can be a reflection of higher costs that exist today as well as market demand, they also underscore how unexpected catastrophes can change the character of areas in short order, Crow said.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of a disaster \u2014 and we saw this with the (2013) floods \u2014 when a community is faced with a conversation around how to replace the housing stock that was lost, very often you start to see conversations that resemble the NIMBY, or \u2018not in my backyard,\u2019 when it comes to affordable housing in communities,\u201d Crow said.\n\nPlus, when an area suddenly loses its housing stock, it puts additional economic pressure on the local and surrounding communities to absorb displaced residents, resulting in the increase of rents and other housing costs, she said.\n\nRecent studies of hurricane-affected communities in Florida and Louisiana have shown that the storms ultimately accelerated gentrification.\n\nLayering tragedy atop tragedy\n\nOne of the immediate negative effects of the Marshall Fire was substantial price gouging, which further compounded issues for affected renters such as Christina Eisert.\n\nEisert, a single mom, had recently returned to Colorado after a brief stint in Texas. She and two of her three boys (one was already off to college) found a single-family home for rent in Superior\u2019s Sagamore neighborhood. The property\u2019s locale, near parks and trails, was ideal when the pandemic hit and provided scenic, safe and secure opportunities for Eisert\u2019s youngest son, who has Down Syndrome, to be outdoors.\n\nIt also served as home base for Eisert, an adjunct professor at the University of Colorado, who had hoped to take on more hours and other contract work to build up enough savings to be able to become a homeowner again.\n\nChristina Eisert poses on December 4, 2024. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nOn December 30, 2021, Eisert and her teenage sons had just left home for a haircut appointment but doubled back when she saw flames nearby. She drove past the emergency barriers that were being put in place and successfully saved their two dogs from a house that soon would be a complete loss.\n\nAs Eisert and her sons navigated the immediate trauma and loss of possessions and memories from their lifetimes, the search for stable housing became extremely challenging. Asking rents had soared north of $5,000 \u2014 well more than double the median in the area.\n\n\u201cThe rents just really exploded immediately; it was such a tragedy on top of all of the other tragedies,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter bouncing around to a couple of apartments, Eisert a few weeks ago bought a small home further north in the county. But it took some doing and a lot of holes to dig out of, she said.\n\n\u201cThe disaster funding wasn\u2019t really accessible to renters, and I probably lost maybe $100,000 worth of property. On top of all of that, you feel like you have less buying power in multiple ways: There\u2019s less property (for sale), the insurance is way higher, there\u2019s new housing, but it\u2019s much more expensive than the houses that would have been if they were for sale before the fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll these things kind of converge.\u201d\n\nRenters especially disadvantaged\n\nIn addition to price-gouging \u2014 which prompted a post-fire law change in Colorado \u2014 disasters leave longer-lasting effects for renters, said Kelsea Best, an assistant professor at The Ohio State University.\n\nBest\u2019s research has focused on how natural hazards and climate change interact with existing inequities and how renters are especially disadvantaged. She was the lead author on a 2023 study in Risk Analysis that found rental prices were driven higher in the years following a hurricane in eastern coastal areas of the US.\n\n\u201cMore intense hurricanes, higher wind speeds, corresponded to significantly higher increases in rents in the years following a storm,\u201d Best told CNN of the research, which studied county-level hurricane disaster data in 19 coastal states from 2008-2019.\n\nPart of the increases stem from an immediate loss of supply; however, it also reflects the delays and challenges of rebuilding and constructing multifamily units post-disaster, she said. Additionally, the financial positions of renters \u2014 who already are typically some of the most economically vulnerable \u2014 are negatively impacted because housing disaster assistance generally favors homeowners, she added.\n\nAerial view of destroyed houses in Port St Lucie, Florida, after a tornado hit the area and caused severe damage as Hurricane Milton swept through Florida on October 11, 2024. Miguel J. Rodriguez Carrillo/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cSome of our findings suggest that there should be more targeted assistance \u2014 federally and locally \u2014 after a storm for renters and for targeted repair and reconstruction of rental homes, which tend to be repaired after private homes are repaired,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd noting how separate research under review shows how hurricanes can contribute to rising evictions, Best suggested that post-storm eviction moratoria could prove beneficial in helping affected residents.\n\nIn terms of addressing affordability more broadly after a disaster, some communities have explored ideas such as community land trusts, relaxing rental rules, ensuring disaster funding is reaching those most in need, and making disaster recovery preparations, Shannon Van Zandt, a Texas A&M professor who has researched how disasters affect housing affordability, wrote in a 2022 commentary.\n\nFollowing the 2013 flood in Boulder County \u2014 a weeklong downpour that resulted in a 100-year event \u2014 the state created the Colorado Resiliency Office, which works closely with communities to understand their risks (economic, climate or otherwise) and prepare for potential disasters.\n\nSince the Marshall Fire, Colorado also enacted several disaster-related laws to address issues such as insurance gaps (as 92% of affected residents were underinsured); rebuilding costs; and safe living conditions.\n\nThe need for a \u2018stitch in time\u2019\n\nUnfortunately, one sudden moment can waylay a person\u2019s life and ability to own a home for years.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than a decade since a torrent of muddy water literally ripped Sarah Jane Romano\u2019s mountain house in two while she made pork chops, eggs and sweet potatoes in the kitchen while swaddling her 9-month-old daughter.\n\nWhile she, her daughter and her then-husband escaped with their lives from the devastating September 2013 flood event in Boulder County, the years that have followed have been mucky, grimy messes of their own. Financially, Romano was caught in a murky holding period with her insurance company and state and county regulators.\n\n\u201cIt was a hair-raising nightmare, you hold your breath and hope that the engineer called it a mud flow instead of a landslide, because if it\u2019s considered a landslide, then you don\u2019t get any money,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd even though the land was condemned, in order to get the insurance payout, they had to dig out the ruins of the home to determine whether the foundation was solid enough for rebuilding, she said. The rigmarole (and the mortgage payments on the destroyed property) continued for two years.\n\nSarah Jane Romano poses on November 19, 2024, with a drawing of her former home, which was destroyed in the 2013 flood event in Boulder County, Colorado. Austin Steele/CNN\n\n\u201cI believe government policy should enact a standard of the local and national governments being able to supersede any punitive and pointless insurance policy which requires homeowners to engage in expensive and lengthy processes to have their sites evaluated once land has been condemned,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have to foreclose on homes that have been destroyed or continue to pay the mortgage as we did on a condemned property in order to get their home\u2019s value returned to them.\u201d\n\nThen there were the multitude of losses beyond the money: the community members who had helped out with child care or pet care; the friendships and emotional support; and her marriage.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she said of her divorce. \u201cAnd many, many, many families in that situation didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nEleven years later, Romano, while acknowledging that she hasn\u2019t \u201cput a penny in retirement since the flood,\u201d is finally on more stable ground. After working six days a week, and scraping together whatever savings she had left as well as borrowing some funds from her parents, she bought a little A-frame in Boulder Canyon for her and her daughter.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be protection at the national level and a stipend program to ameliorate some of these catastrophic stresses,\u201d she said, adding that in turn could help ease burdens on health care costs, businesses and social programs.\n\n\u201cThere is no one who needs the stitch in time more than those whose life\u2019s fabric has been torn by disaster.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Tony Velleca, CEO of CyberProof, a UST company, shared his insights on the challenges of implementing zero-trust security in multi-cloud environments. As organizations navigate the complexities of managing multiple cloud providers, Velleca emphasized the importance of achieving unified visibility, policy enforcement, and continuous monitoring to protect sensitive data and prevent cyber threats.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nMulti-cloud environments present significant hurdles for organizations looking to implement a zero-trust security model. The complexity of managing diverse cloud platforms with varying security configurations, identity management systems, and access controls creates gaps in policy enforcement and visibility. For organizations adopting zero-trust in multi-cloud setups, achieving consistent security across these platforms demands automation, continuous monitoring, and real-time threat detection.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nWhat unique challenges do multi-cloud environments pose for companies adopting a zero-trust security model?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nIn multi-cloud environments, the complexity of managing identities, policies, and access controls across diverse platforms makes implementing a zero-trust security model a distinct challenge. Each cloud provider has unique security configurations, identity management systems, and data protection protocols, so enforcing policies consistently \u2014 not to mention achieving complete visibility is no mean feat. It can be tough to achieve continuous monitoring and validation of users, devices and network traffic across disparate clouds, or it can require significant overheads spent on integration.\n\nAdditionally, as data across multiple clouds can be fragmented, there is an increased risk of misconfigurations and inconsistent security practices, potentially leading to gaps in the zero-trust model. Inter-cloud communication is another hurdle, and managing secure connections and encrypted traffic between clouds demands additional controls and oversight.\n\nHow are you helping clients integrate zero-trust principles with their existing cloud security frameworks?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nSuccessfully adopting zero-trust for multi-cloud requires unified visibility, automated policy enforcement, and a strong understanding of each provider\u2019s unique security ecosystem. At CyberProof, we start with in-depth assessment of each client\u2019s cloud architecture and existing policies, identifying gaps and vulnerabilities. We are partnered with Wiz for cloud detection and response, and integrate CTEM like Interpres Security to map threats to defence gaps.\n\nThe identity of users and their posture is a key component of this. We then map out a zero-trust model that aligns with the infrastructure, so access controls, identity management and threat detection are applied consistently and without gaps across multi-cloud.\n\nReactive security keeps you two steps behind, so regular threat hunting and vulnerability assessments are also essential. Proactively seeking out threats helps to uncover any potential risks, and reinforces the strategies in place for incident response.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nMoving forward, we leverage automation, orchestration and continuous monitoring to enforce zero-trust policies, using real-time identity verification and behavioural analysis to detect potential threats. Threat intelligence and advanced analytics provide visibility over network traffic and access \u2014 even across a multi-cloud reality. We\u2019ve found this approach allows clients to adopt zero-trust principles without the need to overhaul existing security investments.\n\nWhat role do AI and machine learning play in enabling zero-trust architectures within multi-cloud frameworks?\n\nForrester and many other analysts are already touting the benefits of AI and machine learning in enhancing cloud security use cases such as real-time threat detection, user behaviour analysis, and automated response. In a zero-trust model, continuous monitoring and verification of all users and devices are critical, and AI-driven analytics enable this by detecting deviations from normal behaviour patterns that could indicate insider threats or account takeovers.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nMachine learning algorithms can analyse vast amounts of data from multiple cloud environments to identify patterns and detect anomalies faster and more accurately than traditional methods. This capability is especially valuable in multi-cloud settings, where data is distributed, and access requests occur across diverse platforms. Additionally, AI-powered automation can enforce zero-trust policies by instantly verifying identity and access permissions and triggering response actions in real time to minimize potential risks.\n\nCould you discuss any specific zero-trust solutions or services your company offers that address the challenges of multi-cloud data protection?\n\nOur end-to-end Zero Trust Security solution is designed to meet a critical need in any organization\u2019s cybersecurity perimeter. We use the \u2018never trust, always verify\u2019 principle to enforce rigorous security controls for all users, anywhere. Features include continuous authentication, least-privilege access controls, and micro-segmentation to protect crown jewel assets, including sensitive data, network access, and cloud environments.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAccording to Tony Velleca, CEO of CyberProof, a UST company, \u2018A well-planned zero-trust strategy is essential for mitigating the risks associated with multi-cloud environments and improving overall security posture.\u2019\n\nAcross a multi-cloud environment, the risks to data are manifold, including unauthorized access, data leakage, corruption, and cyberthreats. We offer a wide range of data protection services depending on the business context, including data risk assessment and consulting, data discovery and classification, data loss prevention and access control, data integrity and usage monitoring, a range of security audits, and data archiving and destruction.\n\nWhat strategies or tools do you recommend for organizations struggling with secure identity and access management across different cloud providers?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWe would always recommend adopting a unified identity and access management (IAM) strategy that includes centralized policy enforcement, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and advanced behavioural analytics.\n\nTools like Azure AD, Okta, or AWS IAM simplify secure access control across multi-cloud environments. Mapping threat actors as well as how organizations are mapping threat actor campaigns to gaps in their defence infrastructure is also fundamental. With this in place, Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services then integrate with IAM and CTEM tools to monitor and respond to access anomalies in real-time. By centralizing IAM policies and leveraging AI-driven insights, you can streamline secure access, even across diverse cloud providers.\n\nHow can companies measure the success of zero-trust implementation in a multi-cloud setup?\n\nCreating and assessing KPIs at a regular cadence is crucial to measuring the success of a zero-trust implementation and refining and iterating it over time. Three examples of metrics which can be used are:\n\n\u2022 Failed or blocked access attempts: Tracking the reduction in unauthorized access, including unauthorized login attempts across cloud environments can uncover how strong IAM control mechanisms are.\n\n\u2022 Mean-time-to-Detect (MTTD): How quickly are potential threats being identified and mitigated? The shorter the response time, the more effective the monitoring and automated response processes are likely to be.\n\n\u2022 Policy compliance rate: Across all cloud environments, how consistently are access policies being followed? If you note compliance violations or deviations from your baseline access policies, zero trust integration is not yet fully effective.\n\nWhat are the best practices for incident detection and response under a zero-trust framework?\n\nIn a zero-trust environment, effective incident detection and response relies on the ability to continuously monitor, receive real-time analytics, and enforce automated containment of threats. There can be no gaps \u2014 zero-trust requires all traffic, user behaviours, and device activities to be continuously monitored. Behavioural analytics are powerful here; identifying threats before they can add business risk.\n\nWhen a threat is identified, automated containment like blocking malicious IP addresses or isolating compromised accounts should be part of response workflows, which means negligible time between detection and mitigation. In a complex multi-cloud set-up, a unified security platform that ensures consistent policies are applied is crucial and allows for rapid detection even in a heterogeneous context.\n\nReactive security keeps you two steps behind, so regular threat-hunting and vulnerability assessments are also essential. Proactively seeking out threats helps to uncover any potential risks, and reinforces the strategies in place for incident response.\n\nIn your experience, what are the most common pitfalls organizations face with zero trust in multi-cloud deployments?\n\nAccording to Microsoft, 85% of organizations already have a multi-cloud approach, and zero trust is one of their recommended best practices for threat protection and hardening overall security posture. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy! Each cloud provider has its own unique configuration, which means uniform security policies can be a struggle.\n\nThe challenge of managing identities across multi-cloud means there is an added risk of misconfigured permissions or unauthorized access. I\u2019ve seen organizations suffer from inconsistent policy enforcement across clouds, grapple with identity management challenges, and even after heavy architecture changes \u2014 contend with limited visibility across platforms.\n\nImplementing zero trust in a multi-cloud environment starts with visibility, centralizing your view of all activities across all cloud assets \u2014 without gaps. This can strengthen zero-trust efforts, alongside policy alignment, intelligent integrations, and continuous monitoring."

And what an end to an era it was.\n\nAdvert\n\nAfter the 2019 Christmas special, fans have been waiting for five long years to see the Barry and Essex gangs come back together for one final time, and once writers James Corden and Ruth Jones finally revealed that the 2024 episode would be the last ever episode, people were both equally heartbroken and excited.\n\nThe worst event, but an event that made people realise who Smithy's mum is (BBC)\n\nWith so much left unanswered in the last episode, surely 2024\u2019s would clear everything up?\n\nLike, did Smithy say yes to Nessa\u2019s proposal?\n\nAdvert\n\nWhat happened on that fishing trip?\n\nAlas, while Smithy ultimately made the choice we were all hoping for and binned off that annoying Sonia, we never did get the full story between Bryn and Jason.\n\nWhile we have been left hanging for the rest of our lives, there\u2019s at least one mystery which has been solved and that\u2019s: Who is Smithy\u2019s mum?\n\nNow, we had the return of the other Smithy during last night\u2019s episode, and it was amazing to see Sheridan Smith as Rudy again one last time, but when she came accompanied by Cath Smith- his mum, immediately I recognised her.\n\nAdvert\n\nSo did a lot of people.\n\nPlayed by Pam Ferris, it\u2019s about time that everyone recognised the range that she can play.\n\nDo you recognise Cath? (BBC)\n\nNot only did she play a brilliant character in the murder mystery show Rosemary & Thyme, but she\u2019s also fantastic in Call The Midwife and also features in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban as Uncle Vernon's awful sister, Aunt Marge.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, what she\u2019s most remembered for is playing the character of Miss Trunchbull in Matilda.\n\nThat\u2019s right, fans have figured it out and they\u2019ve been left shocked.\n\nA viewer wrote: \u201cMISS TRUNCHBALL IS SMITHYS MUM?\u201d\n\nShe is!\n\nAdvert\n\nAnother stated while pairing a load of exclamation marks: \u201cPAM FERRIS IS SMITHYS MUM!!!!!!\u201d\n\nLastly, a person nodded: \u201cI'll never get over Smithy's Mum being Mrs Trunchbull.\u201d\n\nIt seems like other viewers also realised her face was that of the scariest headmistress in history after re-watching the show following the 2019 special too, as some took to social media to rave about their discovery.\n\nShe was Miss Trunchbull (TriStar Pictures)\n\nOne person wrote: \"Just seen on TikTok that Smithy's mum in Gavin and Stacey also played Miss Trunchbull in Matilda?!?! I'm literally SHOOK.\"\n\nAnother commented: \"The fact that the same actress plays both Miss Trunchbull in Matilda and Smithy\u2019s mum in Gavin & Stacey will forever blow my mind.\"\n\nSomeone else shared: \"It still blows my mind that Miss Trunchbull from Matilda, Smithy\u2019s Mum from Gavin & Stacey and Vernon Dursley\u2019s sister from Harry Potter (the aunt he blew up) are all the same person.\"\n\nFerris is an absolute gem on the silver screen, and her credits in film are just as impressive.\n\nDid you know that she was even in a slew of Christmas films, such as Nativity! and Saving Santa and also Luther.\n\nTidy."

Obama said a lot more about it,\u201d Fox said.\n\n\u201cYou know why? Because he\u2019s already in space. He\u2019s in space right now. He\u2019s in orbit around Saturn right now. He\u2019s like Dr. Manhattan, he\u2019s on the moon in a glass house,\u201d Rogan replied.\n\nFox argued Biden has \u201cnothing to lose\u201d as he\u2019s leaving office. He also noted that the late Harry Reid, a longtime senator, urged presidents in his documentary not to be afraid to speak the truth on the subject of extraterrestrials.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the president of the United States, sir, release the hounds,\u201d Rogan said of Biden.\n\n\u201cPeople are ready for the truth, they\u2019ve had enough of the lying. I think we\u2019re way beyond that at this point,\u201d Fox said.\n\nRogan had some doubts when it came to Trump and aliens, calling the man \u201ccagey\u201d on the subject.\n\n\u201cI agree with you, however, when I confronted Mr. Trump, he was very cagey, very cagey\u2026 He didn\u2019t tell me shit. It was basically like neither confirm nor deny,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring a three hour interview shortly before the presidential election, Trump told Rogan he\u2019d been told \u201ca lot\u201d in regards to UFOs while he was president. He acknowledged it was a subject that \u201cinterested\u201d many people, including Rogan, but he said he\u2019s never been that interested himself.\n\nRogan mocked some for trying to read Trump\u2019s \u201ceyes\u201d during the discussion, saying the man is too much of a professional and in the public eye to give away hints like that.\n\n\u201cNo eyes, I don\u2019t do that shit, especially to a pro like Donald Trump. If you\u2019re going to do it to an actor or something, shut up. You don\u2019t know what the fuck they think. If Daniel Day Lewis told that he just ate a baby, you\u2019d fucking believe him,\u201d he said.\n\nThe podcaster and comedian added that Trump likely isn\u2019t interested in such \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he knows something,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s that interested.\u201d\n\nWatch above via The Joe Rogan Experience."

On October 18, a witness described a UFO leaving a vapour trail, not entirely silent, as it flew over their house and towards the docks.\n\nThe third sighting was reported on October 27 by a resident of Newtownabbey. According to the report, his wife first spotted the UFO through her camera in May and has seen it every night since. They described it as a bright light with holes on its underside.\n\nThe PSNI stated that all three reports this year were \u201cnoted for police information,\u201d without indicating that any investigations had been conducted into the sightings.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence closed its UFO desk\n\nThe number of reports has fluctuated since 2009, when the government\u2019s UFO project was cancelled, citing that in over 50 years, none of the reports received had posed a threat.\n\nWhile the police officially recorded three reports this year, it is likely that more sightings go unreported due to fears of not being taken seriously.\n\nWhat is really crossing the skies over Belfast?\n\nRead more news about Ireland\n\nExplore the latest European stories"

            "article_content": "The end of the year typically brings with it an emotional look back at the days gone by. For archaeologists, looking back into the past is pretty much an every day thing. That said, here are 10 of the most interesting archeological findings that Popular Science covered this year.\n\nNeanderthals and early humans intermingled Europe earlier\n\nStone tools from the Lincombian\u2013Ranisian\u2013Jerzmanowician (LRJ) culture uncovered at Ranis. Item 1 is a partial bifacial blade point characteristic of the LRJ. Item 2 also contains finely made bifacial leaf points. CREDITL \u00a9 Josephine Schubert, Museum Burg Ranis.\n\nIn January, a new genetic analysis of bone fragments from an archaeological site in central Germany found that modern humans had reached northern Europe 45,000 years ago. This new timeline means that their arrival overlapped with the Neanderthals who had been living there for several thousand years before going extinct. It also bolsters the theory that the movement of modern humans into Europe and Asia about 50,000 years ago helped drive Neanderthals into extinction. The findings were described in three separate papers published in the journals Nature and Nature Ecology and Evolution.\n\nMysterious Iron Age burials\n\nThe skeletal remains of a frog and a human were uncovered at Seminario Vescovile in Verona, Italy. CREDIT: S.R. Thompson/SABAP-VR/Laffranchi et al., 2024\n\nA team of archeologists from Italy and Switzerland found that animals buried alongside humans might have been intended to be a meal or companion in the afterlife. They also may have been part of a complex funeral rite during the Iron Age, according to their study published in February in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nOf the 161 people buried at the Seminario Vescovile site in Verona, Italy, 16 were buried alongside animals. Four of the people at this site were buried alongside the remains of dogs and/or horses. These animals were not commonly eaten and the presence of horses and dogs was significant to the team. Earlier Iron Age findings in France and Switzerland indicate that horses and dogs were symbolic at the time and were often present in what appears to be sacrificial rituals, funeral rites, and are frequently associated with specific deities from the time. For the team on this study, the characteristics of a plot called Burial 46 were particularly interesting.\n\n\u201cIt includes the complete skeleton of a horse positioned above a woman, along with the cranium of a dog and the remains of additional horses,\u201d Marco Milella, a co-author of the new study and anthropologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told Popular Science. \u201cThis discovery provides a glimpse into a remarkably complex funerary ritual. While drawing scientifically robust conclusions from just two cases is challenging, we are prompted to consider whether this occurrence is merely coincidental or indicative of a deeper pattern.\u201d\n\nAncient Maya ballcourts were for more than games\n\n\n\nA decorative ring made from carved stone is embedded in the wall of a ballcourt in the ancient Maya city of Chichen Itza in present day Mexico. CREDIT: LanaCanada.\n\n\n\nAncient Mayans may have made ceremonial offerings during the construction of the ballcourts that they used for sporting events. Advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis helped a team of scientists detect evidence of several plants that are known for both medicinal and religious purposes. The team found evidence of four different plants that are associated with ancient Maya medicine and divination rituals.\n\nThese microscopic fragments of ancient plants were found beneath the floor of a Mayan ballcourt in present day Mexico and collecting them was likely purposeful. The findings were described in a study published in the journal PLOS One in April.\n\nThe ball courts in this study were used for several ball games, including pok-a-tok. This combination of soccer and basketball is also undergoing a present day revival. Players likely tried to get a ball through a ring in a hoop affixed to a wall. Ballcourts were considered significant places within cities and even built near some of the largest temples, including in ancient Maya cities like Tikal in Guatemala.\n\n[Related: Tooth powder unlocks clues to an 800-year-old mystery of man thrown into well.]\n\nDecoding the Norton Disney Dodecaheadron\n\nThe dodecahedron on display at the National Civil War Centre, Newark Museum. CREDIT: Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group.\n\nIn the spring, the largest known Roman dodecahedron went on display in England.The cast bronze object was uncovered in the village of Norton Disney in the Midlands of eastern England It is hollow at its middle and roughly the size of a clenched fist and has 12 flat faces are shaped like pentagons. At roughly three inches tall and weighing half a pound, it is one of the largest of these strange Roman objects ever discovered.\n\nThe dodecahedron was sitting among the ruins of a Roman pit and was likely placed there about 1,700 years ago. It was found \u201cin situ,\u201d or deliberately placed among 4th Century CE Roman pottery in some sort of hole or quarry. More archeological excavation is needed to clarify exactly what this pit was used for.\n\n\u201cRoman society was full of superstition, something experienced on a daily basis,\u201d the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group wrote in a statement. \u201cA potential link with local religious practice is our current working theory. More investigation is required though.\u201d\n\nArchaeology in space?\n\nA sample location in the starboard Maintenance Work Area of the International Space Station. The yellow dotted line indicates the boundaries of the sample area. CREDIT: NASA / ISSAP\n\nThe icy cold reaches of space is not exactly the first place to come to mind for archaeological discoveries. That didn\u2019t stop a team from California\u2019s Chapman University to see what they could find on the International Space Station (ISS). The team applied a traditional field strategy aboard the ISS for the first time. They applied the shovel test pit to analyze how the ever-changing \u201cmicrosociety\u201d aboard the ISS has adapted and changed over time.\n\nBack here on Earth, these projects typically involve digging small excavations at regular intervals across a site to gather information on how artifacts are distributed, then pick particularly promising pits for more thorough study. Since there really isn\u2019t anything to \u201cdig\u201d on the ISS, the team selected six locations throughout the space station and tasked astronauts to take daily photos of each space over roughly two months in 2022.\n\nTheir study published in August in the journal PLOS ONE identified 5,438 examples of \u201cartifacts\u201d including an augmented reality headset, Post-It notes, gloves, tools, and writing tools like Sharpie pens. While it is only an initial survey into this subject matter, it\u2019s the first of its kind to document how humans adapt to a novel environment completely removed from what we as a species evolved to handle.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

CREDIT: Professor Nick Pearce, Aberystwyth University, Picasa\n\nIn August, a new hypothesis for where Stonehenge\u2019s six-ton Altar Stone originated was published in the journal Nature. It likely originated 400 miles north in Scotland and not from Wales or other closer areas of southern England as scientists previously thought. This long trek points to the possibility that more advanced transportation methods and societal organization existed here about 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe Altar Stone is about 16 feet long and 19 inches thick and sits at the center of the circle. While it is not currently standing upright like the other stones, scientists are still uncertain if it stood vertically at some point. It arrived in the area sometime around 2,500 BCE, but its exact arrival date is still a mystery.\n\nChemical fingerprints within the grains matched rocks from northeast Scotland and were very different from Welsh bedrock. Specifically, with the age of the zircon minerals in the stone, the team is over 95 percent certain that it came all the way from northeastern Scotland.\n\nCheesy mummies\n\nTarim mummies from the present-day Xinjiang region of Northwestern China. CREDIT: Wenying Li\n\nAt least three embalmed bodies buried with some cheese on them were discovered at an ancient burial site in Xinjiang in northwestern China. The small lumps of fermented dairy, laid around the necks of the deceased, represent the longest-aged cheese ever discovered\u2013at roughly 3,500 years old.\n\nThe ancient cheese was incredibly well-preserved, but a new assessment of the chunks reveals some long-obsecured knowledge about human culture and a potential path for how dairy may have spread across Asia. The findings were published in the journal Cell in September.\n\nA new look at an Ancient Egyptian mummy\n\nLady Chenet-aa\u2019s mummy included artificial eyes to help her see in the afterlife. CREDIT: The Field Museum / Morgan Clark / Popular Science\n\nA team from Chicago\u2019s Field Museum used a CT scanner to determine Ancient Egyptian Lady Chenet-aa\u2019s burial procedure. Lady Chenet-aa lived roughly 3,000 years ago amid the 22nd Dynasty during Egypt\u2019s Third Intermediate Period. Soon after her death, one of the ways funerary experts prepared her for the afterlife was by constructing a cartonnage\u2014a paper mache-like box housing a deceased person\u2019s body.\n\nHowever, Chenet-aa\u2019s lacks any hint of a visible seam, leaving Egyptologists to wonder for years exactly how embalmers placed her inside the casing. Field Museum senior conservator JP Brown likened the mummy and its cartonnage coffin to a model ship inside a bottle.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly important that the inner coffin appeared whole and smooth without any external seams (unlike the outer coffin which was made of wood),\u201d Brown explained to Popular Science. \u201c\u2026 [and] if you look at the shape of cartonnage, the opening at the foot is too narrow for the mummy\u2019s shoulders to fit through.\u201d\n\nPompeii DNA tells a different story\n\nTwo of the plaster body casts from the Pompeii archaeological site. CREDIT: Archaeological Park of Pompei\n\nA new genetic analysis of 14 bodies recovered from Pompeii shed doubt on some of the initial interpretations of who these people were before the cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Using a new genomic analysis, a team of scientists found that their biological sexes and family relationships don\u2019t match up with the initial interpretations. The findings were published in November in the journal Current Biology.\n\nOne notable example is an adult wearing a golden bracelet found holding a child. This was traditionally interpreted to be a mother and child, but the new analysis found that it was an unrelated adult male and child. Additionally, a pair believed to be sisters or mother and daughter, included one genetic male.\n\n[Related: Focaccia likely originated in Mesopotamia, not Rome.]\n\nNeanderthals also loved to collect things\n\nThese marine fossils were found in a Neanderthal cave site, but aren\u2019t native to the area. CREDIT: Quaternary\n\nThe act of collecting objects may stretch at least as far back as our Neanderthal ancestry, according to relics uncovered in a cave in Iberia, Spain.\n\nAn archeological team analyzed 15 small marine fossils found in the fourth level of the Prado Vargas Cave system. While one artifact showed physical evidence of use as a hammer, the other 14 fossils displayed no obvious physical wear or utilitarian value. Additional evidence in the caves also points to the site serving as a semi-permanent Neanderthal encampment likely used for toolmaking, hunting, or perhaps even ritualistic activities.\n\nEarlier research shows Neanderthals engaged in cultural rituals such as ornamental crafting, cave wall art, and even familial and social funeral burials. Due to these rituals, experts argue that it stands to reason the human ancestors likely participated in pastimes such as collecting items they thought were interesting or special in some way.\n\nMaking clothes fit for the ice age\n\nMicro-CT scans of bone needle and needle specimens and the species they were compared with. CREDIT: Pelton et al., 2024, PLOS ONE\n\nIn November, a team in Wyoming proposed the idea that Paleolithic North Americans likely made needles using the bones of foxes, hares, rabbits, bobcats, mountain lions, lynx, and even the now-extinct American cheetah.\n\nBone needles like the ones from this study are common during this period in the North American archaeological record because sewing complex weather garments for freezing weather was a necessity in response to the cold climate shift brought on by the last ice age. There has been little direct evidence of such garments, but bone needles and the bones of the fur-bearing animals used to make pelts provide some indirect evidence of this early tailoring.\n\n\u201cThey were complex garments fringed with the furs of red fox, hare, and cat, some of which with feet still attached as is common among modern trappers,\u201d study co-author and Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton told Popular Science. \u201cThey were likely comparable to similar garments worn by the Inuit, able to withstand the cold and windy conditions of Wyoming\u2019s last Ice Age.\u201d"

Artificial intelligence is one such key, making innovations possible by solving complex problems, automating tasks and enabling research that would have been impossible, or very time-consuming, without it.\n\nBut do we want to do research on all topics, and shall we try the AI master key on every door? To explore this question, let\u2019s consider the use of AI by genomics experts as an example.\n\nIn recent years, genomics experts have added unbelievable depth to what we know about the world and ourselves. For example, genetics researchers have revealed facts about when certain animals and plants were domesticated. In another example, DNA found in 30,000-year-old permafrost was used to create fertile samples of a plant called narrow-leafed campion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportantly, genetic engineering techniques such as CRISPR facilitate extraordinary advances in the treatment of complicated conditions, such as sickle-cell anemia.\n\nThanks to AI developments, we are witnessing a dramatic increase in the pace and scalability of genomic techniques, which will allow researchers to embark on exploratory journeys \u2014 and at the same time, add urgency to already-existing ethical issues. AI companies are also most interested in the scientific implications of this technology. We see this demonstrated in a recent interview between Harvard Business School officials and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In response to the question, \u201cWhat are the pieces of AI that you are most excited about?\u201d Altman said: \u201cGreatly increasing the rate of scientific discovery is what I\u2019m most excited about.\u201d\n\nHowever, given the risks and possible consequences of AI use in science, should we rush headlong into using AI in all kinds of projects?\n\nOne relevant example is research on Neanderthals, our closest relatives, who lived until about 40,000 years ago. Neanderthals have been studied for several years now through genetic investigation of their fossils and their DNA. Genetic engineering can potentially use ancient DNA and genome editing methods to re-create a Neanderthal or aspects of a Neanderthal\u2019s genetics and physiology.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo do this, scientists could start by figuring out the DNA sequence of a Neanderthal by comparing it with the DNA of modern humans, since they are closely related. Then, scientists could use CRISPR to swap out parts of human DNA with Neanderthal DNA. This process would require a lot of trial and error and might not succeed soon, but based on what we know about genetics, if something is possible, AI can help make it happen faster, cheaper and with less effort.\n\nScientists are excited about these developments because they could facilitate new discoveries and open up many new research opportunities in genetic research.\n\nWith or without AI, research on Neanderthals will proceed, but the extraordinary power of AI could give the final push to these discoveries and facilitate this kind of resurrection. At that point, the scientific community must develop norms and guidelines about how to treat these resurrected beings with dispositions very similar to humans. We would need to carefully consider their rights and well-being almost in the same way as when humans are involved and not as research subjects or artifacts of scientific curiosity. These ethical issues are discussed in more detail in a new paper published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence.\n\nA more holistic question to consider is: Should we prioritize the use of resource-intensive AI, researchers\u2019 time and public funds to resurrect extinct beings? Or should we invest these resources into conserving species that are critically endangered today to prevent biodiversity from more degradation?\n\n_____\n\nMohammad Hosseini, Ph.D., is an assistant professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\n_____"

            "article_content": "Home Opinion 2024: The year tide turned on radical gender ideology\n\nWhat is a woman? This is the question that was posed by U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn to then-nominee for the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, during her Supreme Court confirmation hearings. By not providing a simple answer based on basic biology and instead deflecting to the role of an impartial judge, Jackson revealed something that contributed to the turning point regarding transgender ideology that we have witnessed in 2024.\n\nAs a woman herself, no one reasonably thinks Justice Jackson is unable to offer a definition of what constitutes a woman. But feeling the need to avoid responding in a direct fashion was a signal that Jackson, personally in that moment, had prioritized bowing to the bizarre and ever-changing cultural definitions of gender instead of a straightforward acknowledgement of what we all know to be true about the two sexes.\n\nFor many Americans, that a judge who is supposed to make decisions based on reality and facts would shy away from that in an answer, was the latest example of just how far down the path of insanity our culture had strayed\u2014and they wanted no more of it. This is especially the case as it relates to children.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nThe 2024 election was seen by many as a chance to make a national statement about changing direction. And for a large portion of voters, President Trump represented the change they were seeking. An astounding 70% of Concerned Women of America exit poll participants said \u201cTrump\u2019s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls and women\u2019s sports and of trans boys and men using girls and women\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d was an important issue for them when voting.\n\nBut to simply read this dynamic shift in the last two years through a political lens is to miss the ways the tide has turned for parents, within families, and in communities\u2014both here in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nA quick glance at the state of today\u2019s youth reveals a troubling picture: a mental health crisis exacerbated by social media overuse; rising rates of depression, particularly among teenage girls; and a deepening sense of alienation among young men, sometimes culminating in violent outbursts. These challenges are compounded by cultural shifts catalyzed by the sexual revolution\u2014shifts that push the fictional narrative that a boy can become a girl and vice versa.\n\nFor decades, this progressive ideological push seemed unstoppable, especially for children. Yet, this year has brought a surprising and significant pushback, suggesting a return to biological reality is in order.\n\nIn April, the Cass Review, a study commissioned by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service, delivered a damning critique of puberty blockers and gender transition surgeries for children. The report highlighted the lack of scientific evidence supporting these practices, and its findings were affirmed across the political spectrum in the U.K. The fallout was swift, with U.K. policymakers reassessing the medical and ethical implications of such interventions.\n\nLater this year, the controversy surrounding trans-identifying biological males competing in women\u2019s sports came to the forefront in the United States. San Jose State\u2019s volleyball team was credited with multiple forfeit victories after teams in the Mountain West Conference boycotted games against them for including a biological male who identifies as female. This incident underscored the tensions and practical challenges of enforcing fairness in sports under the banner of gender inclusivity.\n\nIn December, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in United States v. Skrmetti, a case centered on a Tennessee law banning gender transition \u201ctreatments\u201d for minors. Tennessee is one of 26 states to enact such legislation, citing insufficient scientific support for these interventions and evidence of significant harm. While predicting a result based on oral arguments is often a fool\u2019s errand, a majority of justices appeared reluctant to overturn Tennessee\u2019s ban and instead may recognize the importance of the state\u2019s role in protecting children from harm.\n\nFinally, just a week ago, the U.K. extended its prohibition on the sale of puberty blockers for minors, with a legislative review set for 2027. This marks yet another step in the growing global resistance to radical gender ideology.\n\nWithout a doubt, our society remains largely libertine, adhering to the belief that \u201cas long as it doesn\u2019t harm anyone, anything goes.\u201d However, the question of harm \u2014particularly when it comes to children \u2014is now being scrutinized more closely. Though I would articulate my objections about transgender ideology for any age or for any context, it\u2019s one thing for adults to subject themselves to radical \u201ctreatments;\u201d it\u2019s another thing entirely when that is forced upon innocent children \u2014and asking society at large to just acquiesce to this.\n\n\n\nWhen children undergo these radical \u201ctreatments,\u201d the harmful effects spread to how we interact and live with one another. When a teenage girl loses her spot on the podium because she\u2019s competing against a biological male in a swimming meet; or when a child comes home and describes his interaction with a child of a different gender in the locker room; or when a mom feels unsafe in a restroom facility at the mall, what might feel abstract or distant becomes deeply personal when it impacts one\u2019s own family.\n\nThe key, however, is not merely to critique what is wrong but to present a positive and hopeful vision. Christians can point to the beauty of the family and a perspective that respects the God-created natural distinctions between male and female, that values the body as an integral part of personhood, and that sees human sexuality as a reflection of divine intent rather than personal whim. And we can do this even while acknowledging some individuals may feel a disconnect about how they perceive themselves. They are in need of support and care, not extreme experimentations that so often lead to destructive results\u2014for them personally and people around them.\n\nIf 2024 has taught us anything, it is that cultural change is possible. The backlash against radical gender ideology suggests that people are hungry for a better story\u2014one that affirms their worth, their bodies, and their God-given identity."
