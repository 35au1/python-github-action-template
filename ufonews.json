        "article_content": "Game Theory: UFO 50 is a massive trove of twists on old-school gaming genius Scroll until you find a title that sounds cool; you may hit something that'll be one of your favorite games of 2024.\n\nWhen approaching a video game project like Mossmouth\u2019s new release UFO 50\u2014an absolutely massive labor of love that is brilliant, frustrating, fun, mysterious, artistically ambitious, and sometimes just really fucking frustrating\u2014it helps to start from base principles. So: UFO 50, released on Steam this week, is a collection of 50 games of varying length and complexity, all purportedly from a fictional 1980s video game developer called UFOSoft. The games in the collection, which are presented in a fake chronological order built around the loosely sketched history of the company, largely draw their inspirations from the library of the Nintendo Entertainment System; amidst more esoteric or complicated pastiches, you can find games that serve as fairly straight homages to River City Rampage, Uninvited, Solar Jetman, Dragon Quest, and many more. There are meta elements operating to the side of the main draw\u2014notes on the games\u2019 fake development, a terminal that lets you go digging for secrets, markers that indicate when you\u2019ve completed individual titles\u2014but the focus has clearly been put on the games themselves, which were developed (in our world) by the Mossmouth team, including Spelunky creator Derek Yu.\n\nThe obvious comparison point for all this, at least for nerds of a certain vintage, will be clear: Cult Nintendo DS title Retro Game Challenge (and its sadly never-exported-from-Japan sequel), which pulled this same basic \u201cfake games from fake consoles from a fake past\u201d conceit back in 2007. Players who come to UFO 50 looking for a direct recreation of that experience might come away a little disappointed, though: Where that game prided itself on building up the fiction surrounding its faux games, complete with fake manuals and fake magazines for players to peruse in between playing its riffs on Mario or Galaga, UFO 50 is a bit more barebones in its presentation. (You get a few sentences of notes per game, and that\u2019s about it.) Given a choice between putting their emphasis on the games, or on the materials surrounding them, the small Mossmouth team understandably focused on function over form; we might wish for a more lush package, but it honestly feels churlish to complain, when the actual content of the collection is far more expansive than we\u2019ve had time to even come close to coming to terms with.\n\nAs to that content: We wish we could declare each of UFO 50\u2032s 50 games a retro-indie masterpiece, each one preserving what worked from classic game design while jettisoning the chaff, but, uh\u2026 No. Don\u2019t get us wrong: There are extremely good games in here, some more than worth the collection\u2019s $25 asking price all on their own. (We have lost too many hours this past week already to arena shooter Overbold, or mechanically gorgeous dungeon crawler Valbrace.) But many of the games in the collection feel torn between their desire to stay true to the clunky, frequently unfair controls of console ages past, and being genuinely fun games. Yes, it feels authentic that Barbuta, the very first game in the collection, happily wipes your progress every time you lose all your lives, erasing what could be 20 minutes of very fussy trap and dungeon navigation. Whether it\u2019s fun is a much thornier question.\n\nBut while we can\u2019t champion UFO 50 as 50 instant masterpieces, we also can\u2019t paint it with the broad brush of being uniformly old-school ornery for its old sake\u2014or a nostalgia exercise with no appeal for players who didn\u2019t grow up pulling battered NES carts off the rental wall of their local video store. The truth is that this really is 50 different games, each with their own control schemes and design hooks, and the quality is inevitably going to vary. Part of the fun of the package, in fact, is in that kind of discovery: For every game you play five minutes of before concluding \u201cEh, not for me,\u201d you\u2019re just as likely to run into something like the boldly strange Mooncat, or \u201cWhat if we\u2019d invented tower defense games on the NES\u201d hypothetical Rock On! Island. At the bare minimum, each title has something genuinely clever powering it, whether it\u2019s Mortol\u2018s attempt to build an action game out of Lemmings DNA, or Avianos\u2018 bird-based war gaming. Half the time, when we caught ourselves thinking \u201cOkay, we get it, let\u2019s move on\u201d after poking around at a game, we turned out to be basically right; the other half, though, we inevitably stumbled into some new secret or twist of play that deepened the experience of an individual title.\n\nUFO 50 is, in other words, a game that trusts you, the player, to find the fun\u2014with the promise that there is a lot of fun to be found in this odd, massive toy chest. We should note that the game does have a few curation tools\u2014if you scroll down to the bottom of the collection, you can filter games by whether they\u2019re meant to be more reflex based, or cerebral, for instance, or focus in on the title\u2019s large number of same-screen multiplayer games. (Breaking free of the chronology is a good idea in any case; although UFO 50 doesn\u2019t pay as much attention to the \u201ccomplexity increases as fictional time passes\u201d conceit that powered Retro Game Challenge, you\u2019ll still tend to find more robust experiences closer to the end of UFOSoft\u2019s fictional lifespan.) We\u2019re sure we\u2019ll soon see a cottage industry of guides and wider critiques pointing out hidden gems buried in its library. But honestly, we recommend just doing what the game itself advises: Scroll through until you find a title that sounds cool, blow off the fictional dust, and take a gamble on the chance you\u2019ll hit something that\u2019ll be one of your favorite games of 2024."

        "article_content": "It\u2019s been seven years since Luis Elizondo began making headlines after resigning from his job as a senior intelligence official for a top-secret Pentagon program that investigated UFO's \u2014 also known as UAP's or unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 and going public about his frustration over the lack of transparency on the issue.\n\nThe longtime military intelligence veteran spent nearly seven years as director for the Department of Defense\u2019s clandestine Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. What he learned during his tenure convinced him that the countless sightings and encounters with highly advanced aerial phenomena by military pilots and personnel posed a potentially grave threat to our national defense.\n\nInstead of dismissing these reports, he wanted Pentagon higher-ups to wake up to the possible dangers our nation \u2014 and planet \u2014 face by these unexplained phenomena.\n\n\u201cThe amount of stigma and taboo that was placed on this topic for so long has really paralyzed the conversation,\u201d the former U.S. Army Counterintelligence Special Agent \u2014 who served in Afghanistan and ran antiterrorism missions \u2014 told PEOPLE in 2021. \u201cBut these things are real. We don\u2019t know what they are yet, but they are real, so we should probably take them seriously.\u201d\n\nElizondo at the Capitol while visiting members of Congress in 2024. Courtesy Luis Elizondo\n\nBy 2023, Elizondo\u2019s revelations had led to congressional inquiries that included mind-blowing testimony and videos from Navy pilots recounting their run-ins with aerial craft that defied our understanding of physics and a one-time intelligence official who alleged that the U.S. government possessed objects of nonhuman origin taken from crash sites.\n\nNow, Elizondo has written a book \u2014 Imminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt For UFOs \u2014 that provides a behind-the-scenes look at the secret program he once helmed, what they learned, and why he felt compelled to resign and go public.\n\n\u201cIt had to be reviewed by the Pentagon, which took almost a year,\u201d says Elizondo, who corroborates the astonishing claim that technology and non-human remains have been retrieved from the location of crashed craft.\n\nHe adds, \u201cI tried every way I could to make it unclassified and they still redacted portions of it, which I actually left in the book [in blacked-out sentences and paragraphs] so everybody could see what sections the Pentagon didn\u2019t want you to read.\u201d\n\nIn a wide-ranging conversation, Elizondo discusses the revelations contained in the pages of his new book and why he believes that our government can no longer ignore what he says has the potential to become the greatest existential danger that humanity has ever faced.\n\nThe front cover of Elizondo's new book. Harper Collins\n\nTell me more about your motivation to write this book?\n\nI think Americans can handle the truth, and I think Americans deserve the truth. The truth is, \"We don\u2019t know what\u2019s in our skies.\" So that was my motivation. More importantly, we are encountering these things over controlled U.S. airspace, over sensitive military installations, and we've been dealing with it for decades. I still have my security clearance and, now, when I go back to the Pentagon, people come up to me and shake my hand and say, \"Man, this is so great. Thank you so much for what you do.\"\n\nBecause before, if you said the term UFO or UAP, you had to whisper it in the back corner of a scif [a U.S. Department of Defense term for a secure room where sensitive military and security information can be discussed]. Now you can be at the lunchroom at the Pentagon and talk about UFOs all day long in the open and no one criticizes you. Now it's a conversation about national security. It's no longer a conspiracy theory. It's now, unfortunately, a conspiracy fact.\n\n\n\nElizondo (with former FBI Director Robert Mueller) in Kandahar where he was working with various US agencies to locate terrorist cells in the area. Courtesy Luis Elizondo\n\nSo you essentially see UAPs as a national security threat?\n\nI never say threat. There's a difference because in order to understand what a threat is, there's two parts of a calculus \u2014 capabilities versus intent. We've seen the capabilities, but we still have no idea of the intent.\n\nLet me give you a simple analogy. I\u2019m sure you lock your doors at night before you go to bed. And, if you have it, you turn on your alarm system. Let's say one morning you wake up, go downstairs to make a cup of coffee and you suddenly see size 12 muddy boot prints on your living room carpet that were not there the night before. No one in your house has been hurt, nothing's been taken. But despite your doors being locked and the alarm being turned on, there are now muddy boot prints on your living room carpet that were not there the night before. My question is\u2014is that a threat? And my response is \u2014 it could be if it wanted to be.\n\nSo what should our government\u2019s response be?\n\nWe should probably be diligent and try to figure out how it's getting in. We've got things that are coming into controlled U.S. airspace over sensitive military installations, interfering with our nuclear capabilities. In some cases, they are creating air hazards with our military weapon platforms like F-18s. They\u2019ve been seen by eyewitnesses, and it's been corroborated by and recorded by gun camera footage. It\u2019s also been corroborated by radar. In some cases we\u2019re seeing up to seven sensor units all reporting the same information at the same time, at the same place, under the same circumstances.\n\nSo we're talking about something real. This is not just an atmospheric aberration or grandma seeing some lights in the backyard. This is real and it's impacting our ability to do our national security mission. So that's why I say that this is a national security issue. Is it a threat? We don't know. But from a governmental perspective, even if there's a one percent chance that this could be a threat, then we have to do our due diligence and make sure that it's not a threat.\n\nA biological sample, and\u2014according to Elizondo\u2014\"possible\" implant, collected (with patient consent) for analysis in 2018. Courtesy Luis Elizondo\n\nSo U.S. government actually has downed space craft that was manufactured by non-human intelligence?\n\nI have to be careful about what I say and stick to what has been approved in my book. I'm not allowed to go beyond that. What I've said is that the U.S. government is in possession of exotic material that appears not to be made by human beings. Now, are these things extraterrestrial? All options have to be on the table until they're no longer on the table.\n\nYou also wrote that the U.S. government is in possession of non-human bodies?\n\nWe have biological samples. I want to be careful saying \"bodies\" because a body infers that you have an intact, entire cadaver or corpse. What I can say is that biological samples have been recovered. And of course, you can fill in the blanks on what that means. It appears that we as a country may be in possession of multiple samples.\n\nCould other countries also be in possession of these specimens and non-human technology?\n\nThat is the concern \u2014 that other countries also have UFO programs. We know it for a fact because the Russians admitted it to us after the Iron Curtain fell and they shared their files with us. They [the Russians] got some pretty compelling information. And here we are pretending like it doesn't exist. Meanwhile, the Russians and the Chinese are going full tilt boogie. That's a problem.\n\nHave you ever held a piece of alien technology in your hands?\n\nI don't want to say \u201calien.\u201d We prefer to say \u201cnon-human.\u201d But, yes. It was a metallic surface that was beveled and had multiple layers of material inside of it. It had all sorts of interesting electrical properties. It was not natural. It was definitely engineered. When we showed it to scientists at one of the top aerospace corporations in the world, they just scratched their heads and said it can\u2019t be manufactured. And yet there it was.\n\n\n\nCan you give me an overview \u2014 in terms of things like speed and acceleration \u2014 of just how truly astonishing this technology is?\n\nSure. Let's look at the five observables. The first observable is instantaneous acceleration \u2014 the ability to change direction and change your velocity very rapidly. When you do that, there are inertial forces [inside the craft] that are experienced. We refer to them as g-forces. A human being can withstand about nine g-forces for a very short period of time while wearing a g-suit to counteract the biological effects of heavy g-forces. If you experience g-forces for too long, you start experiencing biological consequences such as blackouts and, ultimately, death.\n\nOne of the most highly maneuverable aircraft we have is the F-16. At the unclassified level, that plane can pull about seventeen g\u2019s before you start having structural failure, meaning the plane literally begins to disintegrate in midair. The objects that we're detecting are performing up to a four-thousand g\u2019s. That\u2019s well beyond anything that we have from a material science perspective to withstand [these forces]. Biologically, it would turn you [or whatever is inside of it] into the consistency of pudding.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nNext, you have the second observable known as hypersonic velocity, used to describe speeds of Mach five or above. One Mach is equal to the speed of sound, which is roughly 760 miles an hour at sea level. Do we have vehicles that can do Mach five hypersonic? Yes. We have, for example, the Lockheed SR-71. That plane can fly around thirty-two-hundred miles an hour. But when that plane wants to make a right-hand turn, it takes roughly half the state of Ohio to do it. What we are seeing are objects not doing thirty-two-hundred miles an hour, but they're doing ten-thousand to thirteen-thousand miles an hour. And they\u2019re doing immediate right-hand turns. The third observable is a bit of an oxymoron. It's called low-observability, meaning that it\u2019s hard to see on radar. You're getting these nonsensical returns [on the radar screen]. They are also hard to see with the naked eye. The pilots [who have observed them] will say, \u2018Look, I don't know what to tell you. I saw it, but I can't explain it. It didn't have wings. It didn't have a rudder. It didn't even have a cockpit. It looked like a tic-tac. Or it looked like a saucer or a triangle.\u2019\n\nThe fourth observable is called trans-medium travel, the ability to operate in multiple domains or environments. What we are seeing are objects that can perform the same maneuvers in our atmosphere in high altitudes to potentially low-earth orbit and even underwater without any compromises. The last observable is anti-gravity. What that means, in a nutshell, is the ability to defy the natural effects of earth's gravity. These craft have no wings. They don't have any obvious sites of propulsion. There's no obvious means for them to defy earth's gravity. And yet somehow they're able to do that. So when you have a technology that can do all five of these things, you are forced to reconcile the fact that you're dealing with something that is certainly not conventional. Our government has already said, for the record, it's not our technology. And our government has also said, for the record, that it's probably not adversarial technology. So what does that leave?\n\n\n\nHow much energy would it take to power such a craft?\n\nSo in some cases, [the energy required for maneuvers that have been observed by Navy pilots] was equivalent to the power output of the entire United States in a single day. In other cases, it would be equivalent to the power output of the United States in three years.\n\nAre reports of encounters with these craft from military personnel happening every day?\n\nI have to be careful about what I say, but these occurrences occur sometimes on a daily basis.\n\nA sample of bismuth and magnesium that was produced by an aerospace company, hoping to mimic materials that Elizondo says were recovered and of non-Earth origin. \u201cThe best they were able to achieve,\u201d writes Elizondo in his book, \u201cwas this small \u2018brick\u2019 that had only one layer, each brick costing over a million dollars to produce.\u201d. Courtesy Luis Elizondo\n\nAny theories on why these alleged visitations are occurring?\n\nWell, we know that they're interested in our nuclear capabilities. We know that they're interested in our military equities. In human terms, one could speculate that this is some sort of reconnaissance mission. But we don't know. We're looking through anthropomorphic eyes and intentions and motivations. As humans, we do that with each other. But does that necessarily translate to this? Maybe, but we can't, from a national security perspective, take that chance can we? Because remember, it goes back to the equation \u2014 capabilities versus intent. We see the capabilities. We have no idea the intent.\n\nAnd clearly what engineers are attempting to do is to reverse-engineer this technology to understand how it works and then find a way to use it ourselves?\n\nOf course. That\u2019s also maybe the reason why we don't want to have too much of a conversation about this topic. Maybe we don't want our adversaries to know what we may or may not have been able to glean technologically from this. And, by the way, I would never support compromising that information either way. So I don't comment on it. And I am certainly not going to confirm or deny whether or not the US government has indeed reverse engineered this technology.\n\nYou write about objects that have been surgically removed from the bodies of U.S. soldiers who claimed to have had contact with these non-human visitors. Can you expand upon that?\n\nThis was from a U.S. service member who claimed to have had a close encounter with a UAP \u2014 and it was not an isolated incident. In this particular case, you have what appeared to be some sort of very small technical device inside a human body and a surgeon from the Department of Veterans Affairs who successfully isolated it and removed it. But before he could remove it, according to the report, it kept trying to evade capture. Every time he would try to isolate it, it would move [within the veteran\u2019s body]. When he finally was able to remove it from the patient, and it was placed in a petri dish for analysis, it continued moving under its own power source, but ultimately it stopped moving. I can\u2019t tell you how long, but it continued to move by itself long enough for the pathologist to be very concerned. It was encapsulated in human biological tissue, possibly in an attempt to avoid detection. It appeared to be made from some sort of metal. It was square and almost looked like mother of pearl and metallic with different kinds of colors like purples and silver.\n\nAn image from another 2015 encounter with a UAP taken by a Navy fighter jet off the Florida coast. Department of Defense\n\nAnd what would be the purpose of these entities putting implants in humans?\n\nWhy do we microchip our dogs? So if they get lost, we can find them. Why do we microchip the wildebeest in the Serengeti? We want to look at their migratory patterns and their health and [learn about things like] its blood oxygen levels.\n\nYou also discuss in your book some of the health impacts that people, who have gotten too close to this technology, have experienced. Tell me more about that.\n\nThere were actually medical doctors on the U.S. government payroll that were looking at military personnel and intelligence officials who had a close encounter, got too close and suffered medical consequences both externally and internally. These have been documented. There are a lot of these patients. And these people have sustained injuries that were consistent with some sort of directed energy like what might happen if you get too close to a microwave oven. It was the late Senator John McCain who succeeded in getting two special police officers for the Air Force put on full medical disability because they got too close to a U.A.P. [near a military airfield in Suffolk, England, in 1980] and sustained injuries. I mean, if that's not proof that the government knows what's going on, I don't know what is. You don't put people on a hundred percent disability for getting close to a UFO unless you admit that UFOs are real.\n\nIs it accurate to assume that what you write about in Imminent is just the tip of the iceberg of what you know and encountered while working on this program?\n\nThere's a lot more. There's other people who were in my program that will be coming out with additional information that I think will help move this conversation forward. I can't say anything publicly until they come out, but there's a lot of things happening behind the scenes.\n\nAre you confident that our government is finally moving in the right direction on this issue?\n\nWell, let's look at facts. Since last time you and I had a chat [in 2021], we have a former director of National Intelligence, a former director of the CIA, and a former president of the United States, who have all come out on the record to say, \"Yeah, there's something to this. It's real.\" We have the creation of a UFO investigative body that is officially looking at UAP\u2019s for the government. You have landmark congressional legislation that's been passed, with more legislation that's coming. You have whistleblowers coming out and testifying before Congress under oath in front of the American people. Yeah, we've come a long way, my friend. But we've still got a long way to go.\n\n"

Check out all of our opinions for this week in games.\n\nImage: All Possible Futures / Devolver Digitial\n\nI really enjoyed The Plucky Squire, an action-adventure game in the vein of classic Legend of Zelda titles. It\u2019s got not one, but two, whimsical art styles: one reminiscent of children\u2019s picture books, and another in which the hero is presented as a miniature toy that comes to life in a child\u2019s bedroom. The game is most often presented in the former, where screen transitions are accompanied by the turning of a page, and the middle of most stages appropriately folds where they meet. The eponymous hero goes on many adventures with his friends Violet and Thrash, who each embody noble and righteous virtues, while triumphantly defeating the forces of evil time and time again. At the close of these journeys, the Plucky Squire comes home and writes about it all, because naturally he\u2019s also a bestselling author in the land of Mojo. It\u2019s a game with all the fixings of a kids\u2019 classic, something that can be shared with the children in one\u2019s life to encourage them to dream big and boldly. As I played the game, though, I did find myself wishing that The Plucky Squire actually believed in its audience as much as it claims to. - Moises Taveras Read More\n\nImage: Sony\n\nSony is marking the 30th anniversary of PlayStation with a new lineup of limited-edition, PS1-inspired consoles and accessories and they look surprisingly good, especially for those of us who still have fond memories of listening to the disc spin in the original console while grinding through our favorite \u201890s RPG late at night. - Ethan Gach Read More\n\nImage: Saber Interactive / Focus Entertainment\n\nWarhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, made by Saber Interactive, is the sequel to a beloved 2011 shooter and has been praised for, among other things, feeling like an old-school Xbox 360-era game.

In the years since, there have been reports and admissions from the studio that the fourth entry in the studio\u2019s fantasy RPG franchise had undergone multiple revamps, including pivoting away from a live-service, multiplayer-driven game in 2021. At a glance, The Veilguard, with its emphasis on narrative and on the multiple well-developed, three-dimensional companions you can befriend or romance, seems like a strategic shift back to core principles for a studio that has been fumbling to find its voice again. - Kenneth Shepard Read More\n\nImage: Mossmouth\n\nEfforts to preserve, spotlight, and celebrate important games of the past have been gaining steam in recent years. Consider, for instance, Digital Eclipse\u2019s Atari 50, a compilation of games from across that company\u2019s history that provides wonderful context in the form of interviews and archival materials, illuminating their colossal impact on gaming. Now, we have another such compilation: UF0 50, a collection of 50 games from UFO Soft, the business-software-maker-turned-game-developer that, across the 1980s, was responsible for dozens of gems which simultaneously reflected the larger gaming trends of the time, while also innovating and pushing the medium forward in their own right. There\u2019s just one small but crucial detail here, however, that sets UFO 50 apart from any other such compilations: UFO Soft never actually existed. - Carolyn Petit Read More\n\nImage: Nintendo / Kotaku\n\nIf you listen closely, it feels like you can hear the jingle of plastic and metal for Nintendo\u2019s next console as its manufactured and assembled in faraway factories. You can almost sense its launch lineup coming into focus as the company\u2019s developers prepare to put their finishing touches on whimsical new experiments. Rumors and speculation around a supposed Switch 2 have reached a fever pitch as fans await a possible official reveal any week now. So it\u2019s our last chance to share our hopes and predictions for the new hardware before dreams become reality. Here\u2019s what we want from a Switch 2, and what we think we\u2019ll actually get. - Ethan Gach Read More\n\nImage: Sony / Kotaku / Sean Gladwell (Getty Images)\n\nAstro Bot is one of the most entertaining and depressing games I\u2019ve played in ages. It\u2019s a loud, unrestrained explosion of creative energy, it\u2019s an antiseptic corporate product drowning in brand fellatio. A shining example of what current-gen first-party games can be, a dreary reminder of everything they\u2019re not. PlayStation is dead; long live PlayStation. - Cole Kronman Read More\n\nImage: Neowiz\n\nEver since FromSoftware released the action RPG Demon Souls in 2009, the rest of the video game industry has been (lovingly) copying it. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, as the saying goes. Amongst a wealth of solid takes on the genre, last year\u2019s dark fantasy title Lies of P stands out as one of the best. Not only does the game expertly emulate what fans love about the Souls genre, but it also iterates on its formula in exciting ways. Though one year after its release, what I find most charming about Lies of P is just how enthralling its absurd premise actually is. - Willa Rowe Read More\n\nGif: BioWare / Kotaku\n\nEarlier this month, myself and several other content creators and members of the press got to go hands-on with BioWare\u2019s long-anticipated RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard. I came away from my seven hours with it really impressed with what feels like the most cohesive game BioWare has put together since probably 2012\u2019s Mass Effect 3. And part of that time was spent exploring the capabilities of the game\u2019s character creator, with which we had full freedom. - Kenneth Shepard Read More\n\nImage: Devolver Digital\n\nMaking a sequel to an amazing game is hard enough, but with each subsequent entry that task gets even harder. So while 1991's point-and-click adventure game Monkey Island 2 is seen as a stunning improvement over its predecessor, the more the series went on, the harder it was to recapture the original sparkle. That is partially due to changing taste in games over the years and who was actually behind its development, but the sentiment still stands. So when Return to Monkey Island, the sixth game in the franchise, released two years ago on September 19, 2022, over three decades after the original, there was no telling what we were going to get. And yet, Return to Monkey Island might just be the best game in the series to date. - Willa Rowe Read More\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

        "article_content": "Social networks have become increasingly homogenous, showing everything from text to short videos across platforms, where algorithms often overshadow your creativity. In this ubiquitous environment, it\u2019s harder than ever to get a genuine sense of someone\u2019s vibe before deciding to follow them.\n\nEnter Shelf, an app that lets you create a personalized \u201cstorefront\u201d of your media habits, then connect with others based on the movies, shows, books, games, and music they consume. It also lets you track progress while reading your favorite book or watching a trending show.\n\n\u201cIf you observe culture at large on the internet, it\u2019s shifting away from posting selfies to here\u2019s what I\u2019m reading, watching, screenshots of the reviews of my movies and so on. It\u2019s essentially going deeper about a person, trying to understand what they\u2019re in \u2026 that\u2019s what Shelf is all about,\u201d said Jad Esber, co-founder and CEO of Koodos Labs, the startup behind Shelf, in an interview.\n\nEsber grew up writing online poetry anonymously, then spent the early years of his career at YouTube in London from 2015 to 2018. During this time, he worked on the creator side of the Google subsidiary, helping people create content, grow their audience, and monetize their work. This was when YouTube grew its creator ecosystem in various emerging markets outside the U.S.\n\nAfter spending over three years at Google, the Cambridge University master\u2019s graduate returned to academia, joining Harvard University to research consumer internet trends and study the internet academically. That eventually helped him conceptualize Shelf in a market full of social media apps with millions and billions of users.\n\n\u201cWe built many, many products,\u201d Esber told TechCrunch. \u201cThey all didn\u2019t work until Shelf, and Shelf emerged from those learnings.\u201d\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Shelf app, available on iOS and Android, lets you connect your accounts associated with media, including Apple Music, Goodreads, Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube, then builds a customizable \u201cstorefront\u201d web page that updates automatically based on your consumption progress. You can also manually add links to any other internet service to your virtual shelf \u2014 even links to your favorite TechCrunch articles, which you can showcase to your followers.\n\nThe New York-based startup also plans to expand the list of supported services, including Steam for gamers.\n\n\u201c[A]s humans and as people online, we\u2019re very multi-hyphenate. We\u2019re not just into music, movies, shows, and all these things. Adding support for certain categories will expand the user base, but at the same time deepens the use case for existing users,\u201d Esber said.\n\nYou can choose a URL for the digital shelf based on your preference. Likewise, the app lets you customize the interface by changing the background color and moving items depending on your taste.\n\nKoodos plans to monetize Shelf by offering new customization options. It could also explore monetizing insights that the app surfaces, Esber told TechCrunch.\n\nUnlike apps that call the data using APIs, Shelf works regardless of whether the platform has a first-party API. Generally, when users select a third-party service like Spotify or Apple Music from the Shelf UI, they\u2019re signed in (either via a redirect to that app, or via a pop-up screen). Once the user has signed in, Esber can pull all the information about that user\u2019s media consumption directly from the app.\n\nEsber also stated that the startup does not use the data Shelf gets from the services users list on the app to train AI, which has become a common practice among online platforms nowadays.\n\nThis data-sharing is powered by a technology called DataMovers, and Koodos has been working with other apps to expand this solution as well (although Esber wouldn\u2019t say which ones). He compares DataMover with the data transfer network for fintech Plaid.\n\n\u201cIn a similar way [to Plaid], we\u2019re affording that user provision access to data to other applications, too,\u201d he said.\n\nImage Credits: Koodos Labs\n\nPrivate experience in testing\n\nAlongside letting users create their storefronts for the public, Shelf has begun testing a private experience for some users, who only want to track their own media consumption without sharing it.\n\n\u201cWe intend to be a fun utility that anyone can use over time. Everyone has a bookshelf in their living room or at home. So, why can\u2019t everyone have the Shelf?\u201d Esber said.\n\nLaunched publicly this summer after its beta testing at the end of last year, Shelf has added half a billion items by its users. Esber declined to share user numbers but said the number of shelves on the app is growing by 40% month-to-month and that users visit Shelf an average of five times a week to check in on or update their digital shelves or keep up with others\u2019 shelves.\n\nKoodos has raised $7 million in total from investors, including First Round Capital, M13, Blockchain Capital, and IDEO, as well as the founders of companies, including Zynga and VSCO. It also counts Pinterest co-founder Evan Sharp, Dubsmash co-founder (now Reddit VP) Suchit Dash, and the pioneers of market design at Harvard, Professors John Deighton and Scott Kominers."

        "source": "USA Today",
        "article_content": "Prakash Sangam\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThis story was updated to correct a byline.\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: Due to a production error, an earlier version of this story inadvertently included the wrong byline. It has been corrected.\n\nIf you are looking to buy a new laptop for this school year or as a gift during the holiday season, you will be faced with a major decision: Should you buy a next-generation AI-powered Copilot+ PC? However, the recent flurry of announcements by laptop OEMs and chip providers that power them has made that decision almost a misnomer.\n\nWhat is a Copilot+ PC, and why do you need it?\n\nCopilot+ PCs are a new breed of laptops with significant on-device (Generative) Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities. To get this moniker from Windows provider Microsoft, laptops must meet or exceed specific minimum AI processing requirements. For the technically inclined, the requirement is to have a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) with at least 40 TOPS (Trillion Operations Per Second) processing power. Copilot+ PCs offer a full day or more battery life, lightning-fast performance, enhanced user experience and are very thin, light and sleek.\n\nCurrently, most of the AI processing happens in the cloud, which means all your information, be it your interaction with ChatGPT or text-to-image creation with many tools, is sent to the cloud. However, with Copilot+ PCs, most of that processing happens on the device. That means your data remains private and securely stored in the device. Additionally, on-device AI is more accurate, personalized, relevant and almost free. If you want more details on this, please check my articles here and here.\n\nEven if you are not looking to use AI, you have to buy Copilot+ PCs, as they are the best of the breed, most secure and best-looking laptops in the market today, outperforming anything else, even Apple\u2019s MacBook.\n\nAll Copilot+ PCs are not created equal\n\nCopilot+ PCs have a lot of variances in terms of the chip platforms, various configurations of those platforms, many OEMs, price and performance tiers and more. It all started when the smartphone technology giant Qualcomm joined Microsoft and scores of PC OEMs to introduce the first Copilot+ PCs based on its Snapdragon XElite and XPlus platforms in May of this year. They set a new bar for laptop performance.\n\nFollowing Qualcomm, the personal computing giant Intel and AMD introduced their Copilot+ PC platforms. Intel\u2019s platform is called Core Ultra 200V (project name Lunar Lake), and AMD\u2019s is called Ryzen AI300. Many OEMs announced laptops with these platforms at the recently concluded European consumer show IFA.\n\nThere are some key differences between Qualcomm and Intel/AMD platforms. Qualcomm platforms are designed using the technology from Arm, a British company. This technology has been used in smartphones for over twenty years and is known for its exceptional power efficiency. Qualcomm introduced this for PC platforms to achieve path-breaking battery life and thin, light and sleek designs, and it set the target for other vendors. Because it is new, the Arm for Windows app ecosystem is still developing. Almost all essential apps are supported, but some apps, especially some games, may not yet be supported.\n\nIntel and AMD platforms are based on X86 technology, which has been around for over 30 years, so app compatibility is not the issue. However, the Core Ultra 200V and Ryzen AI300 are new designs, and their performance is not yet proven.\n\nSo, when choosing Copilot+ PCs, along with price points, features and others, users must also be aware of the platforms used on those PCs. For reference, here is my review of Lenovo\u2019s Yoga Slim 7x.\n\nUSA TODAY Home Internet:See the best and most reliable broadband plans in your area\n\nWhy is it a good time to buy them now?\n\nTechnology is akin to waves in the ocean \u2014 by the time one reaches shore, another one is ready just behind it. If you want to get the maximum benefits of the latest technology, you must jump in when it is reasonably mature, with ample choices in the market. Copilot+ PCs are exactly at that stage now.\n\nAlmost all PC OEMs now offer Copilot+ PCs, including Lenovo, Dell, HP, Samsung, Microsoft, Asus, Acer and many others. They are available for both consumer and enterprise segments at all price points. For example, PC market leader Lenovo has ThinkPad for enterprises, Yoga for premium consumers, IdeaPad for mid/value-tier and more. Each segment has different variations to suit every consumer and business need. Other PC OEMs have similar offerings as well. At IFA, Qualcomm even introduced a new platform targeting laptops in the $700 range.\n\nMicrosoft offers many Copilot+ AI features and applications for better video calls, live captioning in many languages, text-to-image creation and more. AI is still in its infancy; as we progress, there will be a continuous flow of innovative and user experience-enhancing AI apps and features.\n\nOne key common factor among all Copilot+ PC platforms is that they have the same AI capability across tiers. For example, Qualcomm\u2019s XElite and XPlus have the same AI processor. This means no matter which Copilot+ PC you choose, you get excellent performance for years to come. In summary, if you are in the market for a laptop this year, go ahead and consider a Copilot+ PC."

        "article_content": "When you think about artificial intelligence (AI), things such as self-driving cars and humanoid robots might come to mind. Counterintuitively, it's often a good idea to think about how products are actually brought to life whenever a new big trend emerges. Some of the most lucrative opportunities are also often the least obvious ones.\n\nFor AI to even work properly, companies have to invest large sums of capital expenditures (capex) into data centers. Although data centers might seem like just a piece of real estate, they are far more sophisticated and important. They house critical IT infrastructure, such as chipsets known as graphics processing units (GPUs) -- an important component of generative AI applications.\n\nToday, Nvidia is one of the biggest names in the data center realm. But what if I told you I see another opportunity as the superior choice among data center investments and that it's not even a technology company?\n\nIt's important to consider all options -- even the most tangential ones. Let's dig into a nuclear energy stock that I think may end up being the most important data center company in the long run and explore why this could be a lucrative opportunity for investors.\n\nNuclear-powered data centers are on the rise, and...\n\nA major selling point of AI is that the technology can bring a new wave of efficiency to a host of use cases. From breakthroughs in enterprise software to self-driving cars, AI is promising a new level of productivity and safety that's never been witnessed.\n\nAlthough that sounds great, as with all things, AI comes with some major trade-offs. Namely, building AI applications is a pricey ambition. GPU hardware and high-performance computing software are some of the more obvious expenses in AI development. One of the more subtle costs in an AI roadmap resides with data centers, particularly their energy consumption.\n\nGPUs are constantly running complex algorithms and performing sophisticated computing tasks. This makes IT architecture, such as server racks, consume a lot of energy and, in particular, give off a lot of heat. Data centers are equipped with a number of temperature control protocols, such as air conditioning units, fans, and generators.\n\nHowever, these solutions are both costly and can be inefficient compared to other sources of energy control. An emerging trend at the crossroads of data centers and energy consumption is nuclear power, and some really notable companies and business leaders are getting involved.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n...a lot of big names are involved\n\nOne notable company involved with nuclear-powered data centers is Amazon. One of the biggest businesses in Amazon's ecosystem is its cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Earlier this year, AWS acquired a nuclear-powered data center from Talen Energy for a reported $650 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother player emerging on the nuclear power scene is Oklo. Oklo develops nuclear fission reactors that it aims to sell to data centers and utility companies.\n\nWhen it was still a private company, Oklo raised funding from Peter Thiel and OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman. A few months ago, Oklo went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).\n\nAccording to its investor presentation, the company has received interest for its reactors from major companies, including Diamondback Energy, Equinix, Siemens Energy, and even the U.S. Air Force.\n\nWhile this caliber of attention and Altman's support are impressive, I see Oklo as a risky bet at the moment. The company is still pre-revenue, and the potential deals referenced above are in early-stage negotiations.\n\nOklo will likely require hefty ongoing research and development (R&D) costs to build out its reactors, which will take a toll on the company's liquidity so long as there aren't material sales coming through the door.\n\nMy top pick at the intersection of nuclear energy and data centers is...\n\nMy top choice among nuclear power suppliers for data centers is Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG). The company offers a host of energy services but is making sustainability and nuclear energy a specific focus.\n\nOne of the company's known nuclear power customers is \"Magnificent Seven\" member Microsoft. During the company's second-quarter earnings call in late August, CEO Joseph Dominguez referenced Comcast and Johns Hopkins as other notable customers of Constellation's carbon-free energy services.\n\nOther mega-cap tech companies will likely follow Amazon and Microsoft's moves. Constellation's diverse customer base signals that green energy is not just a use case for data centers or big tech hyperscalers.\n\nInvestors with a long-term horizon may want to consider a position in Constellation Energy right now. I think nuclear energy solutions will become more mainstream as the AI revolution continues to evolve. Given how early the AI narrative seems to be, I think an opportunity such as Constellation Energy is largely overlooked or underappreciated -- making it a tempting buy among other opportunities in AI, data centers, and energy consumption.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Constellation Energy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Constellation Energy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Constellation Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "article_content": "Horace Walpole is acclaimed as the harbinger of horror fiction. Known for his magnum opus \u2018The Castle of Otranto\u2019, Walpole set new benchmarks and paved the way for gothic novels to flourish in the literary world. Since its origin, the novel of terror has successfully and scintillatingly held readers in its sway. Henry James is another famed American novelist who contributed immensely to carrying the legacy of horror fiction forward.\n\nReading Indian author Sugandha Pallan\u2019s latest book, \u2018Where The Dead Come Alive\u2019, it would not be erroneous to state that the author has produced an outstanding work in the genre, with tones reminiscent of Walpole and James. After the success of her previous book \u2018Mother, God, Me & The World\u2019, the author has once again cast a mysterious spell on readers with her latest work.\n\nThough it may sound absurd and surreal, many people in real life have attempted to commune with their deceased loved ones through necromancy\u2014an undeniable truth. Similar endeavours are made in this book to bring Rachna\u2019s dead mother back to life.\n\nNidhi, an orphan, is shocked to discover that her best friend, Rachna, sees Dharampal, their common friend\u2019s father, at a vigil held for COVID-19 victims\u2014a man who died a year ago. Whether dead people really come back to life is a mystery only the readers can unravel.\n\nAs a journalist, Nidhi decides to investigate the supernatural occurrences. During her inquiry, she uncovers that this isn\u2019t the only case. Historically, some people have returned from death, witnessed by a few, marking the catalytic moment when the mystery deepens further.\n\nThe success of such fiction often hinges on its setting, and Pallan excels at creating a plot teeming with surreal, spooky surroundings, looming fear, and paranormal occurrences. The novelist\u2019s writing is lucid and convincing, effortlessly conveying her message. The lugubrious and macabre atmosphere is meticulously captured from the very beginning. Regarding characterization, the author deserves special admiration for crafting characters that leave indelible imprints on readers\u2019 minds. In short, \u2018Where The Dead Come Alive\u2019 is a beautifully crafted tale that will keep readers riveted until the very last page. A must-read!"

An El Ni\u00f1o is declared when sea temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific rise 0.5 \u00b0C above the long-term average.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd while volcanic activity definitely played a big role in the \u2018Great Dying\u2019 (the worst mass extinction in Earth\u2019s history, also known as the Permian-Triassic extinction), experts say the impact of these El Ni\u00f1os shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nChina University of Geosciences\u2019 Professor Yadong Sun claims that oxygen isotopes in fossils suggest they could have been greatly involved in this mass loss of life.\n\nHe said: \u201cMost life failed to adapt to these conditions, but thankfully a few things survived, without which we wouldn\u2019t be here today. It was nearly, but not quite, the end of life on Earth.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming had an impact (Getty Stock Image)\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd co-lead author of this study, Dr Alexander Farnsworth, from the University of Bristol, added: \u201cClimate warming alone cannot drive such devastating extinctions because, as we are seeing today, when the tropics become too hot, species migrate to the cooler, higher latitudes.\n\n\u201cOur research has revealed that increased greenhouse gases don\u2019t just make the majority of the planet warmer, they also increase weather and climate variability making it even more 'wild' and difficult for life to survive.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the exact cause of the Great Dying remains somewhat uncertain but it\u2019s pretty complicated.\n\nAs well as so much time having obviously passed since, there\u2019s a scarcity of fossils to study and a complexity of evidence. Either way, scientists know something big happened to have such a big consequence."

Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nResearchers used advanced algorithms to detect genetic underpinnings of cancer\n\nScientists discover over 800 genes that could potentially cause cancer\n\nBy Akash Pandey 04:55 pm Sep 21, 202404:55 pm\n\nWhat's the story A groundbreaking study by scientists from the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST) in Spain, has identified over 800 genes that could potentially cause cancer. This discovery significantly expands our understanding of how genetic mutations can lead to cancer, a disease typically triggered by changes in our genetic code that disrupt cell growth regulation. The research team used advanced algorithms to detect anomalies in the genetic code related to exons\u2014segments of a gene that directly translate into proteins.\n\nMethodology\n\nNew approach to understanding cancer-causing genes\n\nThe BIST team's research differs from previous studies that primarily focused on abnormalities within the DNA itself. Instead, this study examined anomalies that occur as instructions from DNA are transmitted to the rest of the body. The non-coding sections of a gene, known as introns, are usually removed when a gene's DNA is transcribed into an RNA version in a process called splicing. Cancer cells can disrupt this splicing process to produce mutated proteins from an otherwise normal protein gene.\n\nDiscovery\n\nIdentification of potential cancer-promoting genes\n\nThe BIST team used sophisticated algorithms to identify 813 genes that could potentially promote cancer growth when spliced. This discovery significantly expands the existing list of known cancer-causing genes, which previously included only 626 genes known to cause tumors when mutated. Interestingly, only about a 10th of these newly identified 'splice' class genes were already included in the most widely-used cancer mutation database, that records genes driving cancer growth through mutations.\n\nAlgorithm\n\nNew algorithm identifies potential cancer-driving exons\n\nThe research team developed an algorithm called Spotter, which was able to sift through vast amounts of genetic data to identify splicing events that may enhance cancer growth. In preliminary lab tests on tissue samples, targeting these exons effectively limited cancer growth. \"Not only can Spotter identify potential cancer-driver exons, which we can then trace back to genes, but it can also rank which exons are more important than others in any given cancer sample,\" says BIST biologist Miquel Anglada-Girotto.\n\nPrediction\n\nExon identification could predict patient drug responses\n\nThe study also found that identifying these exons could help predict how different patients might respond to the same drug. This discovery opens up new possibilities for personalized cancer treatment strategies based on individual genetic profiles. While more research is needed before we can routinely identify and target exons within genes, this study shows promising potential for future cancer treatments."

In fact, if one looks at the magnitude of changes that iOS 18 brings to the table with Apple Intelligence at the helm, the hardware enhancements pale in comparison. The Apple iPhone 16 Pro is at the forefront of that movement, thanks largely to the inclusion of Apple\u2019s new AI, which is likely to become a core part of everyone\u2019s iOS experience when it launches. But is there any merit in holding on to an older iPhone?\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro is the focus for most buyers\u2019 \u201ckeep or jump\u201d dilemma. A remnant of the Lightning port era, the iPhone 14 Pro continues to prove its mettle as a reliable warhorse with a terrific camera. But the kind of comprehensive changes across screen, silicon, charging, and software perameters introduced by the iPhone 16 Pro also make it a candidate for an upgrade.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIf you\u2019ve been holding on tight to your iPhone 14 and aren\u2019t sure if there are any meaningful advancements to warrant a spending spree, here\u2019s a detailed breakdown to guide your upgrade decision.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: specs\n\nSpecs iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Size 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25 mm (5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches) 147.5 x 71.5 x 7.85 mm (5.81 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches) Weight 199 g (7.03 oz) 206 g (7.27 oz) Screen 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR OLED 1206 x 2622 pixels ProMotion with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate Dolby Vision, 2,000 nits brightness 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED 1179 x 2556 pixels ProMotion with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate Dolby Vision, 2,000 nits brightness Operating system iOS 18 iOS 18 Build Titanium with textured\n\nmatt glass back Stainless steel with textured matt glass back Buttons Action Button\n\nCamera Control Ring/Silent switch Storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB Processor Apple A18 Pro Six-core CPU Six-core GPU 16-core NPU Apple A16 Bionic Six-core CPU Five-core GPU 16-core NPU Camera Rear: 48-megapixel primary, f/1.8, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 120\u00b0 FOV 12MP telephoto, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Front: 12MP, f/1.9 aperture Rear: 48MP primary, f/1.78, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 120\u00b0 FOV 12MP telephoto, f/1.78, 3x optical zoom Front: 12MP, f/1.9 aperture Video Rear: 4K, up to 120 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Rear: 4K, up to 60 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, dual-band Bluetooth 5.3 Wi-Fi 6, dual-band Bluetooth 5.3 Ports USB-C Gen 3.2 DisplayPort Lightning USB 2.0 Water resistance IP68 (maximum depth of 6m up to 30 minutes) IP68 (maximum depth of 6m up to 30 minutes) Battery & charging Up to 23 hours video playback 45W fast charging 25W wireless charging via MagSafe 15W Qi2 wireless charging Up to 27 hours video playback 25W fast charging 15W wireless charging via MagSafe 7.5W Qi wireless charging Colors Black Titanium, White Titanium, Natural Titanium, Desert Titanium Space Black, Silver, Gold, Deep Purple Price Starts at $999 Starts at $999\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: design and display\n\nThere isn\u2019t much to discuss here about any design overhaul, as the fundamental aesthetic language is identical. However, there are a few refinements that can only be felt when the two devices are held in hand. The iPhone 16 Pro is slightly taller and thicker than the iPhone 14 Pro, and a touch lighter too. That weight disparity predominantly has to do with the build\u2019s material of choice. The latest flagship from Apple relies on titanium, which is lighter, more resilient, and better equipped to handle heat dissipation. The iPhone 14 Pro, on the other hand, has a stainless steel frame married to a matte glass shell.\n\nAnother crucial difference concerns the edges. The iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s sides were quite sharp and the phone dug into the palm in quite an uncomfortable fashion. The iPhone 16 Pro takes a more rounded approach to the edges, making it cozier to hold, if not a day-and-night difference.\n\nApple has also slimmed down the bezels to accommodate a larger display on the phone. With the iPhone 16 Pro, you also get USB-C (Gen 3 port with Display Port support) with 10Gbps output as it ditches the Lightning Port (USB Gen 2) on the iPhone 14 Pro. In a nutshell, you get faster data transfer bandwidth and liberation from the dongle life.\n\nThe ingress protection is identical across both phones at an IP68 level, but the color options vary. The iPhone 16 Pro serves up a new Desert Titanium look that\u2019s somewhat inspired by the gold trim on the iPhone 16 Pro, but the latter\u2019s signature Deep Purple is gone. The rest of Apple\u2019s latest options include silver, white, and black.\n\nAnother core difference, as mentioned above, is the display. The iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3-inch panel, up from the 6.1-inch OLED screen on the iPhone 14 Pro. The rest of the attributes, such as pixel density, peak refresh rate, and brightness output remain identical. Apple says the latest iteration of Ceramic Shield on the iPhone 16 Pro is twice as strong, while the OLED panel\u2019s brightness can drop to as low as 1 nit, which is technically great news from the lens of power efficiency.\n\nAnother crucial change is the introduction of two extra buttons on the iPhone 16 Pro that replace the mute switch on the iPhone 14 Pro. The Action button has already become a favorite of folks for folks looking to execute tasks or even shortcuts with the press of a button.\n\nThis year, we also get the Camera Control, a physical button with a capacitive side to it. It\u2019s a camera shutter in spirit, but can do a lot more. Using slide gestures, it can also handle adjustments like ISO or zoom level, among other camera controls.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: camera\n\nFor users deep into video capture and engaged in professional workflows, the latest from Apple offers plenty. Both phones rely on a mostly identical 48-megapixel main camera and a 12MP zoom camera, but the iPhone 16 Pro takes things up a notch by upgrading the 12MP ultrawide lens to a 48MP sensor.\n\nAnother crucial upgrade is the inherent zoom architecture. The iPhone 14 Pro has a 3x optical range using a lens tunnel system for zooming. The iPhone 16 Pro reaches a 5x optical zoom range, thanks to the tetra prism lens architecture that was first seen on the iPhone 15 Pro Max. It also jumps to the Smart HDR 5 pipeline for more effective color contrast output.\n\nOn the imaging side, the iPhone 16 Pro enables full 48MP macro capture and can also take Spatial Pictures suited for viewing on the Apple Vision Pro headset. There are also new photographic styles on the table, alongside a new pad adjustment system to achieve the exact strength of a specific style. While that sounds appealing, it\u2019s really the video capture side of things where the iPhone 16 Pro races into an altogether different league.\n\nTo start, the rear camera can now shoot 4K Dolby Vision videos at both 100 frames per second (fps) and 120 fps, and the results look incredible. Of course, for users who like more control over their video edits, the phone also opens the doors for log capture (with support for the Academy Color Encoding System), something the iPhone 14 Pro misses out on.\n\nApple has also armed the iPhone 16 Pro with four studio-quality mics, and they play a supremely important role. Apple claims they deliver more true-to-life sounds. The trick in question is audio mixing. Essentially, when you shoot a video, you can pick between directional audio presets like in-frame, studio, and cinematic. These presets let users focus on a certain audio sources in their video. The samples captured by users suggest that it works really well.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: performance and software\n\nThe biggest shift between the iPhone 14 Pro and its 16-series counterpart is the processor, which not only stands out based on hardware merits, but also opens the doors for an entirely new software experience courtesy of Apple Intelligence.\n\nNow, depending on how excited you are about AI, you may or may not make an upgrade choice, but here\u2019s the lowdown. The A16 Bionic in the iPhone 14 Pro is based on TSMC\u2019s 4nm process, and it serves a six-core CPU and a five-core graphics engine. The iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s A18 Pro, built atop the newer 3nm node, packs six graphics cores.\n\nThe lift in processing firepower stands at 30%, while the GPU performance is improved by 40% this time around. Even compared to the mighty A17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro, Apple is touting a two-fold gain in hardware-accelerated ray tracing performance in games. It\u2019s just that there are only a handful of games out there that can push ray tracing on the new and improved flagship iPhone.\n\nNow, both iPhones have already received the iOS 18 update, but the experience is going to be quite different. The biggest upgrade is Siri interactions, which are not only a lot more natural, but also dig deeper into apps for seamless integration to get work done. It can even handle multimedia content editing using voice commands.\n\nThat means not only can Siri more efficiently perform tasks across different apps (both in-house and third-party), but it can also look into the details stored by these apps and accordingly respond to user queries. Additionally, when it can\u2019t handle certain queries, they will be offloaded to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack. The Notes app gets Writing Tools that let you handle rewrites, corrections, formatting, and summarization with a single click. AI smarts have also been extended to the Mail app, where they enable email summarization as well as smart reply suggestions.\n\nApp notifications are also intelligently brought together, summarized, and passed through focus filters. It works really well, though the system takes a few days to assess the app interaction habit before it can fine-tune the notification behavior. Another cool perk is automatic transcription and voice notes that can also be summarized with a single click.\n\nOn the more fun side of things, users will be able to convert rough sketches into beautiful drawings with a simple highlight and selection gesture. The Image Playground feature brings text-to-image facility across different places, including Messages.\n\nAlso, for users who often run into the need to look up Apple\u2019s product guides online, Siri will save them a browser trip, as the virtual assistant has ingested those guides and will offer step-by-step instructions right in the dialog box. Another cool upgrade is Screen Awareness, which lets the AI assistant take a peek at the onscreen content and answer contextual queries.\n\nApple Intelligence really is a big difference here \u2014 but it\u2019s worth remembering that Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t available yet, even on iOS 18. Instead, it will launch with iOS 18.1.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: battery and charging\n\nOne of the most notable quality-of-life upgrades offered by the iPhone 16 Pro is improved mileage, as well as faster charging. The iPhone 16 Pro is claimed to last for 27 hours of video playback on a single charge, while the iPhone 14 Pro could only manage 23 hours. That translated into a single day of charge in the iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s real-life use, but we won\u2019t know if the iPhone 16 Pro can meet or exceed this until we\u2019ve had time with it.\n\nAccording to regulatory data, the iPhone 16 Pro can technically reach a wired charging pace of 45 watts, which is dramatically faster than the iPhone 14 Pro. Additionally, the Qi wireless charging pace has reached 15W, up from 7.5W on the iPhone 15 Pro.\n\nApple has also boosted the MagSafe output for its latest flagship. The iPhone 16 Pro can reach a MagSafe power delivery peak of 25W when paired with a 30W brick, while the iPhone 14 Pro could only muster 15W for juicing up the lithium-ion unit packed inside its glass-metal chassis.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs iPhone 14 Pro: availability and price\n\nThe Apple iPhone 16 Pro is now available for sale. The base model of the phone will set you back $999, with more storage costing more and rising all the way to a 1TB option. The Apple iPhone 14 Pro is similar, with the same storage options and an initial starting price of $999.\n\nHowever, given the latter\u2019s older age, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll find the iPhone 14 Pro at a much lower price than the newer flagship. During sales periods, it could be significantly so, making it a much more attractive option to those looking for a bargain.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: should you upgrade?\n\nThe Apple iPhone 16 Pro, as mentioned above, is pushing the envelope with both software- and hardware-side innovations. But that also begs the question \u2014 is the iPhone 14 Pro a laggard that demands an upgrade just two years into its product life?\n\nWell, the answer depends on how much utility you are going to get out of the exclusive iPhone 16 Pro perks.\n\nThe biggest differentiator, of course, is Apple Intelligence. The AI-driven overhaul of iOS 18 puts Siri and next-gen machine learning capabilities into every corner of the iPhone\u2019s software. And over time, those AI conversations \u2014 especially Siri integrations \u2014 will appear inside third-party apps, as well. Ultimately, it will boil down to how much one has grown weary of the boring iOS experience and seeks to experience what a next-generation AI-driven experience feels like.\n\nThen we have the camera chops. Now, the iPhone is still one of the nicest smartphone camera systems out there, and that applies to the iPhone 14 Pro as much as the iPhone 16 Pro. Is the newer phone better? Yes. Is it a big enough gulf that you\u2019ll feel like the older phone is missing out? That\u2019s less likely.\n\nHowever, if you intend to push your phone in terms of ultrawide capture and, more importantly, videos that try to challenge a DSLR, the enhanced zoom and high-fps Dolby Vision perks will really light up a social media feed with stunning samples.\n\nNow, Apple has kept the asking price the same, which is great news and makes the upgrade even more compelling. For those who can score a good trade-in deal, and can absorb the deficit hit on their wallet, the iPhone 16 Pro is absolutely worth the jump. For the rest, the iPhone 14 Pro is still enough to last at least another year, or two, with ease."

(NYSE:GWRE) stands against other best mid cap growth stocks.\n\n50 Basis Point Reduction: Exaggeration or Hidden Benefit?\n\nRecent discussions among financial strategists emphasize the current stock market dynamics, particularly regarding the upcoming US elections. Investors are encouraged to view dips in stocks of some sectors as long-term buying opportunities, as historical trends suggest that 10% corrections can be advantageous entry points.\n\nWhile recent sell-offs were driven by sector-specific issues rather than broader economic concerns, the long-term outlook remains positive. Despite recession worries, the US economy is stable, with strong consumer performance and corporate profits exceeding expectations. This has contributed to a rebound in the NASDAQ and S&P 500.\n\nInflation has reportedly dropped to a three-year low of 2.6% in August, marking the lowest rate since March 2021. As inflation continues easing, there has been ongoing speculation that the Fed may begin cutting interest rates, potentially starting with a 25 basis point reduction.\n\nMarket analysts, including Gene Goldman and Craig Johnson, anticipate multiple rate cuts due to slowing inflation and economic growth. We discussed this earlier in our article about the 12 Best Small Cap Tech Stocks to Buy. Here\u2019s an excerpt from it:\n\n\u201cGene Goldman expressed that his base case anticipates 3 rate cuts of 25 basis points each, beginning in September. His belief lies in the slowing inflation, a deceleration in economic growth, and the overall resilience of the economy, which he thinks is not as dire as some reports suggest. Goldman noted that while the labor market showed mixed signals, with both positive and negative data, the market\u2019s expectations for deeper rate cuts may be exaggerated\u2026. Craig Johnson was also of the opinion that a 25 basis point cut is already anticipated by the market, suggesting that a 50 basis point cut could raise concerns among investors. He believes that a series of 25 basis point cuts would align with their perspective. Craig emphasized the importance of staying calm considering that, historically, October has been a strong month for the markets, with gains observed 86% of the time since 1929.\u201d\n\nHowever, on September 16, Erika Najarian, UBS senior equity research analyst, mentioned that small and mid-cap stocks could potentially benefit from a 50 basis point cut.\n\nNajarian attributes the recent underperformance of financial stocks to market concerns about the implications of potential rate cuts for economic stability, leading investors to question a less favorable economic outlook. She believes some anticipated cuts may already be reflected in money center bank stock prices due to their strong year-to-date performance. A 50 basis point cut could especially benefit mid-cap stocks affected by commercial real estate issues.\n\nStory continues\n\nShe explains that a 50 basis point cut would significantly impact net interest income. Money center banks benefit more from rising rates, while mid-caps are liability-sensitive and may see deposits repriced faster, favoring them if rates are cut aggressively.\n\nThe recent Basel III news with lower capital thresholds triggered negative stock reactions, exacerbated by JPMorgan\u2019s comments on reduced investment banking and trading growth targets. Factors included ongoing Basel III discussions since December 2023 influencing pricing, a leading bank suggesting consensus net interest income expectations are too high, casting doubt on other banks, and emerging signs of consumer weakness potentially spreading beyond lower-income segments.\n\nNajarian highlights the challenges analysts face in predicting net interest income due to shifting rate expectations. While higher rates have traditionally benefited bank profitability, potential cuts create uncertainty about financial performance. She points out that banks must choose between cutting rates to remain competitive or maintaining volume, complicating forecasts for net interest income.\n\nAs Najarian emphasizes the uncertainty surrounding interest rate cuts and their effects on the financial sector, and investors await clarity from the Fed, we\u2019re bringing you a list of the 16 best mid-cap growth stocks to buy now.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAn insurance adjuster reviewing images and paperwork to process a claim.\n\nGuidewire Software Inc.
