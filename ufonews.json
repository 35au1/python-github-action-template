            "article_content": "The FAA has placed temporary flight restrictions on the operation of drones over parts of New Jersey, according to a notice published on the agency\u2019s website. The ban on drone activity is likely related to the recent bout of mass hysteria over supposed \u201cdrone\u201d sightings, though the agency hasn\u2019t said so explicitly. The FAA told the New York Times the ban was enacted at the request of \u201cfederal security partners,\u201d without elaborating further.\n\nThe drone ban covers 22 different New Jersey communities and is set to expire on Jan. 17, 2025. It\u2019s not immediately clear why that end date was chosen. The FAA didn\u2019t address Gizmodo\u2019s questions about the specific timing of the flight restrictions and their relation to drone sightings in an email Thursday morning and directed us to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cWe continue to assess there is no public safety threat relating to the reported drone sightings,\u201d a spokesperson from DHS told Gizmodo over email. The spokesperson did not address our specific questions on the record.\n\n\u201cIn coordination with the FAA and our critical infrastructure partners who requested temporary flight restrictions over their facilities, out of an abundance of caution, the FAA has issued temporary flight restrictions over some critical infrastructure facilities in New Jersey,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\nPeople in New Jersey started reporting odd \u201cdrones\u201d in the sky to police around Nov. 18, according to NBC News, and there have reportedly been sightings every day since, aside from a conspicuous pause on Thanksgiving. The so-called drones have caused more and more people to post videos taken of what they believe to be unmanned aerial vehicles. And while some of the videos are difficult to explain, the vast majority appear to be regular commercial aircraft.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not unusual for internet cranks to get worked up about nothing, this drone panic has spread to areas that are unexpected. Several elected leaders have called for action by the federal government, including president-elect Donald Trump who\u2019s both claimed the government is trying to hide something and said they should be shot down.\n\nBut the concern has been bipartisan. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, has called for more action and played up the hype.\n\n\u201cSome of the drones are small. Some of the drones\u2019 flight patterns are erratic,\u201d Schumer said on Sunday, according to NBC News. \u201cMultiple drones flying together can confuse a traditional radar system and that\u2019s why, again, this new technology can really get us the answers that we need.\u201d\n\nPeople are also pointing lasers at commercial flights, an incredibly dangerous activity that can light up the inside of a cockpit and blind pilots. Laser strikes were already a serious problem, but have become so common during the current drone hysteria that the FAA was forced to issue a statement warning the public not to do it. Shining a laser at planes is a federal crime that can bring jail time and hefty fines.\n\nSome of the most difficult-to-believe theories about the drones are coming from elected leaders, including claims by a Republican congressman that they\u2019re actually being deployed by an Iranian mothership off the east coast of the U.S.\n\n\u201cKnow that Iran made a deal with China to purchase drones, motherships, and technology in order to go forward,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Van Drew from New Jersey on Fox News Dec. 11. \u201cThe sources I have are good. They can\u2019t reveal who they are because they are speaking to me in confidentiality. These drones should be shot down.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Iran has deployed a drone mothership, despite the fact that Van Drew has access to real power and should know things. Van Drew is a member of the U.S. House Transportation Subcommittee on Aviation. But nothing would surprise us at this point when it comes to weird sightings. With Trump taking power again in a month, things are shaping up to get so much weirder in the months and years ahead, drones or no drones."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nA new study published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, unveils a novel approach to measuring public attention using reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). The research bridges the gap between unconventional indicators and macroeconomic analysis, revealing surprising links between UAP sightings and economic conditions at multiple geographical levels in the United States.\n\nThe study highlights that UAP reports, often dismissed as a niche phenomenon, serve as a robust proxy for public attention. By analyzing daily-level data from NUFORC (National UFO Reporting Center), the researchers show that UAP sightings are more frequent in wealthier regions but exhibit counter-cyclical patterns within those regions over time. These findings suggest that shifts in attention to extraordinary phenomena may reflect broader fluctuations in public focus.\n\nKey findings include:\n\nMacroeconomic correlation: UAP sightings are positively correlated with economic conditions across regions but display counter-cyclical patterns within regions over time.\n\nCausal evidence: A quasi-experimental design leveraging variations in COVID-19 lockdown restrictions demonstrates a causal link between restricted mobility and increased UAP reports, further establishing the measure as an indicator of public attention.\n\nPolicy implications: Regions with higher UAP sighting levels show muted responses to monetary policy shocks, suggesting that attention variations can significantly influence economic outcomes.\n\nThe researchers compared UAP sightings to conventional attention metrics, finding strong correlations. This innovative measure offers unique advantages, including the ability to analyze attention at different geographical and temporal scales.\n\nImplications for policy and research\n\nGoldstein and Raveh's findings underscore the central role of public attention in economic dynamics. Their work not only enhances the toolkit for macroeconomic analysis but also provides policymakers with insights into managing public attention to mitigate economic shocks.\n\nThe study invites further exploration into how unconventional forms of attention, like UAP sightings, intersect with economic behaviors. \"We hope this work inspires future research to deepen our understanding of the connection between public attention and macroeconomic outcomes,\" the authors state.\n\nThe research uses comprehensive UAP sighting data from NUFORC, spanning over two decades, to construct a daily-level panel of reports across U.S. counties. The analysis integrates economic, social, and environmental factors to ensure robust conclusions.\n\nThis pioneering work highlights the value of thinking beyond traditional metrics, shedding light on the role of seemingly unrelated phenomena in understanding economic patterns.\n\nMore information: Nathan Goldstein et al, Looking up the sky: unidentified aerial phenomena and macroeconomic attention, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications (2024).

            "article_content": "Dee and Joe Indiviglio like to go out on their front porch at night, and look up. That\u2019s where they were on Dec. 4, when they saw something they hadn\u2019t seen before above their Middletown, New Jersey, home: a group of lights, moving quickly, strangely all over the sky, for maybe a half-hour or longer.\n\nA few days after that, Dee did something else unusual for her. She uploaded a video of those odd lights to a new-ish app called Enigma. \u201cI usually don\u2019t share anything, ever. Even if I did something crazy. But I don\u2019t know, for some reason, something made me share that night. And I did,\u201d she tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEnigma started out as a tool to capture UFO sightings. \u201cBy using modern technology, we will crowdsolve this age-old mystery together,\u201d the company\u2019s website reads. But in the last month, the company has made a hard pivot to a more modern puzzle, tracking whatever the hell is flying over the Eastern Seaboard, where all sorts of people are claiming to have witnessed something unusual. \u201cSeen a drone? Hundreds are being reported to Enigma,\u201d the top of the site now reads.\n\nEnigma is currently #25 in news in the iPhone app store. Usage of the app is up 40 percent from last month, the company claims, and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people are using the network. Daily sightings in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area \u2014 ordinarily just one or two \u2014 hit 37 last week, and more than 250 around the country. The surge says something, and not just about about how much weird stuff we see overhead in an age of cheap drones, or how prone people are to freak the fuck out in our post-rational age. \u201cOfficials (FBI, DHS, and local police) are failing in communications and the internet is rife with misinformation. People need somewhere to go,\u201d the company\u2019s founder tells Rolling Stone via email. She\u2019s hoping that Enigma winds up \u201cfilling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nThe founder only wants to be identified as \u201cA\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m just trying to minimize the crazies that enter my life in the next few months,\u201d she says; it\u2019s a drawback of dealing with a rather, um, intense alien-hunter community. But I\u2019ve verified her identity. She became fascinated with the subject after the military declassified those UFO videos around 2020. Eventually, that led to a start-up, which received backing from well-known venture capital firms like Haystack and Lux Capital. The website went up in January 2023, and the app launched that May. Today, she has a small team, still fewer than 20 people, trying to keep up with the flood of reports. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nEach Enigma submission is geo-tagged, categorized by factors like the shape of the object, the type of movement it made, and how long it was in the sky. Then Enigma gives each one a reliability score on a scale. The report from a ship\u2019s captain in Parsippany, New Jersey, describing a silver disk scored a 62 out of 100. A report out of North Plainfield, New Jersey, from someone who saw \u201c4 different white or sparkly orbs\u201d while \u201cpraying\u201d only netted a 39 out of 100. The Indiviglios\u2019 sighting ranked 58. Joe Indiviglio, a regular stargazer who counts himself as \u201ca little [nerdy] when it comes to aviation,\u201d sounds even more confident than that. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any aircraft that could be man-made,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing in our backyard, facing the planes as they\u2019re landing at Newark [Airport], they come in from the west and make a hard left turn,\u201d he continues. The lights he and his wife saw were \u201cnowhere in a flight path. [They were] more towards the ocean \u2026 definitely more towards the coast, away from Newark.\u201d\n\nAn FBI official told reporters earlier this week that they\u2019d received about 5,000 tips, fewer than 100 of which were credible enough for follow-up investigation. \u201cThe sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,\u201d added John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson. \u201cWe have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.\u201d Related Content\n\nRebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department\u2019s intelligence chief, told reporters that amateur sleuths trying to probe the mystery lights with drones of their own might actually be feeding a sense of hysteria. \u201cYou can create the public safety threat that you\u2019re trying to investigate,\u201d she said.\n\nA version of that argument is what worries some observers about Enigma. When I was first introduced to Enigma Labs in the summer of 2023, the company promised they were on the verge of getting officially endorsed by NASA. That endorsement never came, though an agency report endorsed the idea of an app for collecting UFO sightings. I also spoke with a number of science writers at the time who were wary of the project. It wasn\u2019t just that eyewitnesses can be shockingly unreliable, especially about lights flashing in the sky. It was the idea of combining what should be the most serious of scientific questions \u2014 are we alone? \u2014 with the dopamine chase of a social network. It didn\u2019t seem like a recipe for rock-solid information. But, as A points out, people are sharing their sightings anyway; at least Enigma applies some rigor to the clips. \u201cThink about the incentives on Facebook or Twitter, where people are more likely to do something because they want likes or they want to be famous or they want engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be famous or go viral because of us. Everyone goes through a standard reporting process where you have to report basic facts. Like, we need the time, we need the location, we need standard descriptions. And we\u2019re looking at the metadata, we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t have deepfakes.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nSome of the biggest peddlers of drone hokum have been elected officials. There\u2019s the Republican congressman who swore the drones were being dispatched from an Iranian mothership; the Democratic senator who swore he saw something UFO-y in the sky \u2014 only to later admit it was just plain-old planes; the former governor who posted a video of \u201cwhat appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above my residence\u201d \u2014 turns out, it was the constellation of Orion. Rep. Nancy Mace, notorious in Washington for her attention-seeking antics, tried to hop in on the drone panic by publicly speculating whether the objects were \u201cfrom outer space.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is not exactly camera-shy, proclaimed that he was \u201ctaking to the Senator floor \u2026 to respond to the reports of drone activity.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump, never one to leave a news cycle without his imprint, posted, \u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThis may be getting some significant public attention, but it isn\u2019t the first time such concerns have gripped D.C. Over 17 days last December, a squadron of a dozen or more drones buzzed by Langley Air Force Base, home of the U.S. military\u2019s top-of-the-line F-22 stealth fighters. That October, five drones appeared above a Department of Energy nuclear test site in Nevada. Officials from the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and FBI are still stumped about who\u2019s behind the incursions, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Enigma founder says she was in Washington, D.C., the other day, mostly talking to folks on Capitol Hill. The guesses about what these sightings might be ran \u201cthe full gamut\u201d from secret military project to \u201c\u2018Oh, these are just hobbyist drones, or commercial delivery drones.\u2019 Which is bananas to me, because nobody\u2019s getting a burrito from Amazon these days.\u201d\n\nIf A has a favorite explanation, she\u2019s disinclined to share it. But one explanation she completely rejects is that everyone is just mistaken, and all at once. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a general part of the public that does get confused. They look at a Starlink [mini satellite] and they think it\u2019s an alien. But that is definitely not 100 percent of what\u2019s going on. And not everyone is confused by airplanes. It\u2019s not just mass hysteria. There is a percentage of the activity that is real,\u201d she tells me.\n\n\u201cAnd of the reports we get, a lot of them describe objects that are very large. You know, this is not a DJI drone, right?\u201d she adds, referring to the popular mini-drone maker. \u201cSo that\u2019s the stuff we pay attention to. We did an analysis last week. We found, like, 54 percent of things reported to us were described as hovering. So that\u2019s not plane activity.\u201d\n\nThe Indiviglios were hoping to find a little confirmation on Enigma that others saw just what they did. \u201cI can\u2019t find any. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of freaked out,\u201d Dee says. It\u2019s especially disconcerting, because she keeps seeing something strange up above. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them three times now. The latest was earlier this week. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, here we go again.\u2019\u201d"

            "article_content": "Mishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Android 16 is introducing a new WritingTools API.\n\nThe WritingTools API lets apps opt out of writing tools that enable keyboards to replace the user\u2019s text with text generated by AI.\n\nApps might want to disable AI writing tools when the user is inputting text in certain text fields like for emails.\n\nGoogle rolled out the second developer preview of Android 16 the other day, bringing the platform a whole host of new developer features like better app control over haptics, search support for cloud media items in the photo picker, an adaptive refresh rate API, and more. As usual, it also includes changes that Google didn\u2019t highlight in its announcement, some of which we\u2019ve already covered. The latest change we\u2019ve spotted is a new Writing Tools API that seemingly lets apps opt out of having AI rewrite text for you.\n\nYou\u2019re reading an Authority Insights story. Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won\u2019t find anywhere else.\n\nWhile digging through the documentation for Android 16 DP2, we notice that Google documented two new methods in the EditorInfo class: isWritingToolsEnabled() and setWritingToolsEnabled() . The EditorInfo class basically lets apps communicate information about an editable text field (like the type of text content it contains) to the current input method (i.e. an Android keyboard app).\n\nThe new isWritingToolsEnabled() method returns true when an Editor has AI writing tools enabled, which are enabled by default on all text fields. The documentation notes that \u201ctoolkits can optionally disable [AI writing tools] where not relevant e.g. passwords, number input, etc.\u201d\n\nMishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nThe documentation under the new setWritingToolsEnabled() method explains how it can be used by apps to opt out of having writing tools rewrite text using generative AI.\n\nMishaal Rahman / Android Authority\n\nSome keyboard apps like Gboard have AI writing tools that help you proofread or rewrite text using on-device or cloud-based generative AI models. Gboard has a proofread option on some Pixel devices, for example, that helps correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in any text that you\u2019ve typed, pasted, or dictated.\n\nMost apps should have no reason to opt out of AI writing tools in most text fields, but some apps may want to instruct the current keyboard app to not allow them in some situations. It doesn\u2019t make sense to allow AI writing tools to be used to replace text in fields where you have to input an email address, password, or phone number, for example.\n\nWhile Gboard already hides most irrelevant options when it\u2019s focused on a number or password field, some other keyboard apps might not, which seems to be the logic behind this new Writing Tools API. Regardless, it\u2019s going to be up to keyboard apps to respect this new API. Even if they do, though, it seems like it\u2019d be very easy to work around, as you could always just generate text in another app and then insert it into the text field where it\u2019s supposed to be blocked.\n\nWe\u2019re still digging through Android 16 Developer Preview 2 to find out what\u2019s new, so keep an eye out for more coverage on Android Authority.\n\nGot a tip?

            "article_content": "Yet realizing measurable business value from AI-powered applications requires a new game plan. Legacy application architectures simply aren\u2019t capable of meeting the high demands of AI-enhanced applications. Rather, the time is now for organizations to modernize their infrastructure, processes, and application architectures using cloud native technologies to stay competitive.\n\nThe time is now for modernization\n\nToday\u2019s organizations exist in an era of geopolitical shifts, growing competition, supply chain disruptions, and evolving consumer preferences. AI applications can help by supporting innovation, but only if they have the flexibility to scale when needed. Fortunately, by modernizing applications, organizations can achieve the agile development, scalability, and fast compute performance needed to support rapid innovation and accelerate the delivery of AI applications. David Harmon, director of software development for AMD says companies, \u201creally want to make sure that they can migrate their current [environment] and take advantage of all the hardware changes as much as possible.\u201d The result is not only a reduction in the overall development lifecycle of new applications but a speedy response to changing world circumstances.\n\nBeyond building and deploying intelligent apps quickly, modernizing applications, data, and infrastructure can significantly improve customer experience. Consider, for example, Coles, an Australian supermarket that invested in modernization and is using data and AI to deliver dynamic e-commerce experiences to its customers both online and in-store. With Azure DevOps, Coles has shifted from monthly to weekly deployments of applications while, at the same time, reducing build times by hours. What\u2019s more, by aggregating views of customers across multiple channels, Coles has been able to deliver more personalized customer experiences. In fact, according to a 2024 CMSWire Insights report, there is a significant rise in the use of AI across the digital customer experience toolset, with 55% of organizations now using it to some degree, and more beginning their journey.\n\nBut even the most carefully designed applications are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. If given the opportunity, bad actors can extract sensitive information from machine learning models or maliciously infuse AI systems with corrupt data. \u201cAI applications are now interacting with your core organizational data,\u201d says Surendran. \u201cHaving the right guard rails is important to make sure the data is secure and built on a platform that enables you to do that.\u201d The good news is modern cloud based architectures can deliver robust security, data governance, and AI guardrails like content safety to protect AI applications from security threats and ensure compliance with industry standards.\n\nThe answer to AI innovation\n\nNew challenges, from demanding customers to ill-intentioned hackers, call for a new approach to modernizing applications. \u201cYou have to have the right underlying application architecture to be able to keep up with the market and bring applications faster to market,\u201d says Surendran. \u201cNot having that foundation can slow you down.\u201d\n\nEnter cloud native architecture. As organizations increasingly adopt AI to accelerate innovation and stay competitive, there is a growing urgency to rethink how applications are built and deployed in the cloud. By adopting cloud native architectures, Linux, and open source software, organizations can better facilitate AI adoption and create a flexible platform purpose built for AI and optimized for the cloud. Harmon explains that open source software creates options, \u201cAnd the overall open source ecosystem just thrives on that. It allows new technologies to come into play.\u201d\n\nApplication modernization also ensures optimal performance, scale, and security for AI applications. That\u2019s because modernization goes beyond just lifting and shifting application workloads to cloud virtual machines. Rather, a cloud native architecture is inherently designed to provide developers with the following features:\n\nThe flexibility to scale to meet evolving needs\n\nBetter access to the data needed to drive intelligent apps\n\nAccess to the right tools and services to build and deploy intelligent applications easily\n\nSecurity embedded into an application to protect sensitive data\n\nTogether, these cloud capabilities ensure organizations derive the greatest value from their AI applications. \u201cAt the end of the day, everything is about performance and security,\u201d says Harmon. Cloud is no exception."

            "article_content": "OpenAI is setting the stage for an agentic AI future, making ChatGPT more capable and seamlessly integrated into users\u2019 daily workflow.\n\nOn the 11th day of \u201812 Days of OpenAI, \u2019 the company showcased advancements in ChatGPT\u2019s desktop capabilities, highlighting the evolution of ChatGPT from a conversational assistant to an agentic tool\u2014ready to take on tasks and collaborate seamlessly across your desktop environment.\n\nToday, the company announced support for apps like Apple Notes, Notion, Warp, Xcode, and 30 more. In a demo, OpenAI also demonstrated how ChatGPT can work with the Notion app, fetch content within a selected section of the document, and generate additional, relevant content.\n\nThe demo showed how ChatGPT helped analyse Git comments in Warp. The results were visualised in a holiday-themed bar graph. In another demo, ChatGPT worked with macOS accessibility APIs in Xcode.\n\nMoreover, OpenAI announced the integration of Advance Voice Mode with this feature. This lets ChatGPT work with apps based on your voice-based commands.\n\nFinally, the dream demo of talking to ChatGPT about stuff on your computer\n\n\n\nShipping today on macOS:\n\n\u2013 Advanced voice works with your apps\n\n\u2013 New tools like @warpdotdev\n\n\u2013 Extending beyond devs with Apple Notes, @NotionHQ, and more!\n\n\n\nNext:\n\n\u2013 More apps & capabilities\n\n\u2013 Windows pic.twitter.com/xgAMt8TOet \u2014 Alexander Embiricos (@embirico) December 19, 2024\n\nThis new development comes in the backdrop of OpenAI releasing the ChatGPT desktop version in November this year, marketing its first step into computer vision and agentic control.\n\nDrops Another AGI Easter Egg\n\nBut, the demo didn\u2019t compete with another AGI easter egg. In one of the presentation screens, AIM was able to spot a directory in an Xcode project titled \u201cAGI_Interface.swift\u201d.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time in the last twelve days, and OpenAI dropped another notable easter egg a few days ago, a calendar event titled \u2018Super Secret AGI\u2019. This further adds to the expectations that all the announcements of the 12 days could cumulatively give users a sense of general intelligence.\n\nOpenAI also mentioned that a Windows app for ChatGPT will be released soon. However, a bigger revelation is the confirmation of a new agent, who is said to be released in 2025.\n\n\u201cAs our models get increasingly powerful, ChatGPT will become more and more agentic,\u201d said OpenAI, and they also added that they will have more to say on it in 2025.\n\nA few weeks ago, reports surfaced that OpenAI is working on a new AI agent titled \u2018Operator\u201d \u2013 but all the company did in today\u2019s event was just to confirm the plans. Perhaps, OpenAI caved into the heat that it is facing from competitors.\n\nGoogle recently announced Project Mariner, which can navigate and take action on a web browser tab on your behalf. Similarly, Microsoft announced the Copilot Vision, which can see content on your web browser and provide relevant information. And, of course, there\u2019s Anthropic\u2019s Computer Use, released well before any other tool.\n\nThat said, there is just one day remaining in 12 Days of OpenAI, and it looks like they\u2019re saving the best for the last \u2014 which is a new and powerful frontier model. It will be interesting to see what OpenAI has in store or how different the model is going to be from o1.\n\nA few benchmarks have been suggesting that o1 is the most powerful AI model yet and even outperforms the Claude 3.5 Sonnet in coding tasks.\n\nO1 BLOWS EVERYONE ELSE AWAY \u2013 IT IS A BEAST IN REASONING AND IS ALSO THE BEST IN CODING!!\n\n\n\nThe new o1 model from 12/17 is #1 on Livebench AI and scores 91.58 in Reasoning!!\n\n\n\nFinally, OpenAI also BEATS Sonnet in Coding. \ud83e\udd2f\n\n\n\nPretty much the only drawback to o1 is that it takes too\u2026 pic.twitter.com/roMDMPckCR \u2014 Bindu Reddy (@bindureddy) December 19, 2024\n\nA few days ago, a user on X spotted the GPT-4.5 model with a limited preview capability.\n\nThat said, today\u2019s event follows the nature of developer-centric announcements from two days ago. On the ninth day, OpenAI launched the o1 model in the API and upgraded it with function calls, structured outputs, reasoning effort controls, developer messages, and vision inputs.\n\nWhile OpenAI unveiled other features like Projects, WhatsApp integration, and ChatGPT for Apple Intelligence, the highlights remain the launch of o1 Pro and Sora.\n\nHowever, Google was quick to respond with Veo 2, and the company\u2019s testing revealed that it outperforms competitors like Kling, Moviegen \u2013 and, of course, Sora. The buch doesn\u2019t end there. Just a few hours before today\u2019s event, the tech giant unveiled an advanced reasoning model, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.\n\nThe \u2018shipmas\u2019 battle is getting quite heated up, and for OpenAI, it all depends on what they\u2019re going to release on the last day of \u201812 Days of OpenAI\u2019 and the final day tomorrow."

Kentucky Coal Museum\n\nA Coal Miner's Home exhibit at the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum features furnishings found in many coal miners' homes.\n\n231 Main St. Benham, 40807; Tuesday-Saturday 10 a.m.-5 p.m. and Sunday 12 p.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps no place is more qualified to portray the realities of life in a coal mine than Benham, Kentucky. Once a coal camp, this tiny eastern Kentucky town is now home to the Kentucky Coal Museum. The museum encapsulates what life as a coal miner would have been like. Given the significance of coal mining in the commonwealth's history, the preserved history of the industry that countless Kentuckians devoted their careers to may be of interest to Kentuckians from all over.\n\n2. Vent Haven Museum\n\nA room filled from floor to ceiling with ventriloquist dummies at the Vent Haven Museum in Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky. June 30, 2020\n\n33 West Maple Ave., Fort Mitchell; Open by appointment only May 1 through Sept. 30.\n\nIn the northern Kentucky city of Fort Mitchell resides the \"world's only museum dedicated to ventriloquism,\" according to the Vent Haven Museum's website. While many people may balk at the idea of entering a building occupied by more than 1,200 dummies and related memorabilia dating back to the 19th century, the museum's founder, W.S. Berger, spent decades collecting the items. Berger died in 1972, and the museum opened in 1973 after he formed a charitable organization to ensure his collection stayed intact.\n\n3. Great American Dollhouse Museum\n\n344 Swope Drive, Danville; Wednesday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith more than 200 dollhouses, model buildings and box rooms that capture astonishing detail with their designs and furnishings, the Great American Dollhouse Museum is a window into worlds from several U.S. time periods and regions, including the Colonial period, the Old West, and modern eras, according to the museum's website. Other sections of the museum include a miniature scene mimicking a 1910s town, and a fantasy-inspired sections replete with mythical creatures like elves, witches and trolls.\n\n4. International Paranormal Museum and Research Center\n\nA section of the International Paranormal Museum and Research Center dedicated to aliens.\n\nClosed until spring of 2025 for relocation.\n\nThe International Paranormal Museum and Research Center in Somerset is a hub for people interested in the inexplicable phenomena that grip the imagination of humankind \u2014 from ghosts to cryptids to aliens. The organization investigates these subjects and collects artifacts found along the way to display to the public.\n\nThe museum is in the process of moving out of its home of seven years and anticipates reopening in Spring 2025, though its new location has not yet been announced. Rest assured, if you've yet to experience this attraction, the museum's management is confident they'll come back better than ever.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Dinosaur World Kentucky\n\n711 Mammoth Cave Road, Cave City; Open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nIf you're young or young at heart, you can help your imagination soar back to the time of the dinosaurs by heading to Cave City. Dinosaur World is an outdoor museum with hundreds of life-sized dinosaurs on display that also offers a host of educational activities that allow children to search for and examine fossils and minerals.\n\nContact reporter Killian Baarlaer at kbaarlaer@gannett.com or at @bkillian72 on X.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Weird museums: 5 unique Kentucky museums to visit in 2025"

Throughout his distinguished television career, Jonathan has rubbed shoulders with the creme de la creme of the entertainment industry. Yet, in his latest TV venture, Jonathan Ross: Haunted Homecoming, the beloved presenter revisits his childhood haunts for a spine-chilling journey into the past, engaging with entities far removed from his usual Hollywood guests - the supernatural. Known for his interest in horror and the macabre, Jonathan's return to his old East End neighbourhood takes a dark turn as he delves into its grim history and hunts for signs of paranormal activity, landing him in a real-life horror story. Accompanied by psychic medium Ian Lawman and paranormal investigator Dr Kate Cherrell, Jonathan recounts a horrifying childhood experience in the basement of his Leytonstone family home before venturing into the nearby Epping Forest, where things take a disturbing twist in the dead of night, reports the Mirror.\n\nJonathan Ross has filmed a new two-part series where he goes down memory lane\n\nThe tension escalates at the infamous Hitchcock Hotel on Wanstead Flats, as an ominous presence infiltrates its most daunting room and they unearth spectral secrets of one of his former local pubs. During a tense moment in the woods, the crew's concern is palpable as they fail to locate Jonathan. Dr Kate expresses her worry, saying: \"I don't want to make things worse but I think we've lost Jonathan. \"I've lost Jonathan, he's just walked into the woods and hasn't come back.\"\n\nJonathan's return to his old East End neighbourhood takes a dark turn as he delves into its grim history\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nWith the holiday season upon us, many companies are finding ways to take advantage through deals, promotions, or other campaigns. OpenAI has found a way to participate with its \"12 days of OpenAI\" event series.\n\nOn Wednesday, OpenAI announced via an X post that starting on Dec. 5, the company would host 12 days of live streams and release \"a bunch of new things, big and small,\" according to the post.\n\nAlso: I'm a ChatGPT power user - here's why Canvas is its best productivity feature\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the campaign, as well as a round-up of every day's drops.\n\nWhat are the '12 days of OpenAI'?\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared more details about the event, which kicked off at 10 a.m. PT on Dec. 5 and will occur daily for 12 weekdays with a live stream featuring a launch or demo. The launches will be both \"big ones\" or \"stocking stuffers,\" according to Altman.\n\nWhat's dropped so far?\n\nThursday, December 19\n\nOn the second to last day of '12 days of OpenAI,' the company focused on releases regarding its MacOS desktop app and its interoperability with other apps.\n\nUsers can now use the desktop app on MacOS to see and automate their work with ChatGPT. There will be more releases of this nature in 2025, but until then, OpenAI has been introducing the three features below.\n\nUsing the \"Work with Apps\" button, users can now work with many more coding apps. The list includes: BBEdit, MatLab, Nova, Script Editor, TextMate, Android Studio, AppCode, CLion, DataGrip, GoLand, IntelliJ IDEA, PHPStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, RustRover, WebStorm, Prompt, and Warp.\n\nFor users who use ChatGPT for writing, the desktop app now supports Apple Notes, Quip, and Notion.\n\nLastly, the desktop app for MacOS now supports Advanced Voice Mode while working with other apps.\n\nFeatures have already been shipped. All you have to do is have the latest version of the MacOS app and a Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu subscription.\n\nTo ease privacy concerns, OpenAI says ChatGPT will only work with apps when manually prompted. When the feature is active, users know what will be attached to the message.\n\n\"Day 12, we have something super special, so don't miss it,\" teased OpenAI about its upcoming Friday release.\n\nWednesday, December 18\n\nHave you ever wanted to use ChatGPT without a Wi-Fi connection? Now, all you have to do is place a phone call. Here's what OpenAI released on the 10th day:\n\nBy dialing 1-800-ChatGPT, you can now access the chatbot via a toll-free number. OpenAI encourages users to save ChatGPT in their contacts for easy access.\n\nUsers can call anywhere in the US; in other countries, users can message ChatGPT on WhatsApp. Users get 15 minutes of free ChatGPT calls per month.\n\nIn WhatsApp, users can enter a prompt via a text as they would with any other person in their contacts. In this experience, it is just a text message.\n\nThe phone call feature works on any phone, from a smartphone to a flip phone -- even a rotary phone.\n\nThe presenters said it is meant to make ChatGPT more accessible to more users.\n\nTuesday, December 17\n\nThe releases on the ninth day all focus on developer features and updates, dubbed \"Mini Dev Day.\" These launches include:\n\nThe o1 model is finally out of preview in the API with support for function calling, structured outputs, developer messages, vision capabilities, and lower latency, according to the company.\n\no1 in the API also features a new parameter: \"reasoning effort.\" This parameter allows developers to tell the model how much effort is put into formulating an answer, which helps with cost efficiency.\n\nOpenAI also introduced WebRTC support for the Realtime API, which makes it easier for developers \"to build and scale real-time voice products across platforms.\"\n\nThe Realtime API also got a 60% audio token price drop, support for GPT-4o mini, and more control over responses.\n\nThe fine-tuning API now supports Preference Fine-Tuning, which allows users to \"Optimize the model to favor desired behavior by reinforcing preferred responses and reducing the likelihood of unpreferred ones,\" according to OpenAI.\n\n\n\nOpenAI also introduced new Go and Java SDKs in beta.\n\nAn \"AMA\" (ask me anything) session will be held for an hour after the live stream on the OpenAI GitHub platform with the presenters.\n\nMonday, December 16\n\nThe drops for the second Monday in the 12 days of OpenAI series all focused on Search in ChatGPT.\n\nThe AI search engine is available to all users starting today, including all free users who are signed in anywhere they can access ChatGPT. The feature was previously only available to ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nThe search experience, which allows users to browse the web from ChatGPT, got faster and better on mobile and now has an enriched map experience. The upgrades include image-rich visual results.\n\nSearch is integrated into Advance Voice mode, meaning you can now search as you talk to ChatGPT. To activate this feature, just activate Advance Voice the same way you regularly would and ask it your query verbally. It will then answer your query verbally by pulling from the web.\n\nOpenAI also teased developers, saying, \"Tomorrow is for you,\" and calling the upcoming livestream a \"mini Dev Day.\"\n\nFriday, December 13\n\nOne of OpenAI's most highly requested features has been an organizational feature to better keep track of your conversations. On Friday, OpenAI delivered a new feature called \"Projects.\"\n\nProjects is a new way to organize and customize your chats in ChatGPT, meant to be a part of continuing to optimize the core experience of ChatGPT.\n\nWhen creating a Project, you can include a title, a customized folder color, relevant project files, instructions for ChatGPT on how it can best help you with the project, and more in one place.\n\nIn the Project, you can start a chat and add previous chats from the sidebar to your Project. It can also answer questions using your context in a regular chat format. The chats can be saved in the Project, making it easier to pick up your conversations later and know exactly what to look for where.\n\nIt will be rolled out to Plus, Pro, and Teams users starting today. OpenAI says it's coming to free users as soon as possible. Enterprise and Edu users will see it rolled out early next year.\n\nThursday, December 12\n\nWhen the live stream started, OpenAI addressed the elephant in the room -- the fact that the company's live stream went down the day before. OpenAI apologized for the inconvenience and said its team is working on a post-mortem to be posted later.\n\nThen it got straight into the news -- another highly-anticipated announcement:\n\nAdvanced Voice Mode now has screen-sharing and visual capabilities, meaning it can assist with the context of what it is viewing, whether that be from your phone camera or what's on your screen.\n\nThese capabilities build on what Advanced Voice could already do very well -- engaging in casual conversation as a human would. The natural-like conversations can be interrupted, have multi-turns, and understand non-linear trains of thought.\n\nIn the demo, the user gets directions from ChatGPT's Advanced Voice on how to make a cup of coffee. As the demoer goes through the steps, ChatGPT is verbally offering insights and directions.\n\nThere's another bonus for the Christmas season: Users can access a new Santa voice. To activate it, all users have to do is click on the snowflake icon. Santa is rolling out throughout today everywhere that users can access ChatGPT voice mode. The first time you talk to Santa, your usage limits reset, even if you have reached the limit already, so you can have a conversation with him.\n\nVideo and screen sharing are rolling out in the latest mobile apps starting today and throughout next week to all Team users and most Pro and Plus subscribers. Pro and Plus subscribers in Europe will get access \"as soon as we can,\" and Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next year.\n\nWednesday, December 11\n\nApple released iOS 18.2 on Wednesday. The release includes integrations with ChatGPT across Siri, Writing Tools, and Visual Intelligence. As a result, the live stream focused on walking through the integration.\n\nSiri can now recognize when you ask questions outside its scope that could benefit from being answered by ChatGPT instead. In those instances, it will ask if you'd like to process the query using ChatGPT. Before any request is sent to ChatGPT, a message notifying the user and asking for permission will always appear, placing control in the user's hands as much as possible.\n\n\n\nVisual Intelligence refers to a new feature for the iPhone 16 lineup that users can access by tapping the Camera Control button. Once the camera is open, users can point it at something and search the web with Google, or use ChatGPT to learn more about what they are viewing or perform other tasks such as translating or summarizing text.\n\nWriting Tools now features a new \"Compose\" tool, which allows users to create text from scratch by leveraging ChatGPT. With the feature, users can even generate images using DALL-E.\n\nAll of the above features are subject to ChatGPT's daily usage limits, the same way that users would reach limits while using the free version of the model on ChatGPT. Users can choose whether or not to enable the ChatGPT integration in Settings.\n\nRead more about it here: iOS 18.2 rolls out to iPhones: Try these 6 new AI features today\n\nTuesday, December 10\n\nCanvas is coming to all web users, regardless of plan, in GPT-4o, meaning it is no longer just available in beta for ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nCanvas has been built into GPT-4o natively, meaning you can just call on Canvas instead of having to go to the toggle on the model selector.\n\nThe Canvas interface is the same as what users saw in beta in ChatGPT Plus, with a table on the left hand side that shows the Q+A exchange and a right-hand tab that shows your project, displaying all of the edits as they go, as well as shortcuts.\n\nCanvas can also be used with custom GPTs. It is turned on by default when creating a new one, and there is an option to add Canvas to existing GPTs.\n\nCanvas also has the ability to run Python code directly in Canvas, allowing ChatGPT to execute coding tasks such as fixing bugs.\n\nRead more about it here: I'm a ChatGPT power user - and Canvas is still my favorite productivity feature a month later\n\nMonday, December 9\n\nOpenAI teased the third-day announcement as \"something you've been waiting for,\" followed by the much-anticipated drop of its video model -- Sora. Here's what you need to know:\n\nKnown as Sora Turbo, the video model is smarter than the February model that was previewed.\n\nAccess is coming in the US later today; users need only ChatGPT Plus and Pro.\n\nSora can generate video-to-video, text-to-video, and more.\n\nChatGPT Plus users can generate up to 50 videos per month at 480p resolution or fewer videos at 720p. The Pro Plan offers 10x more usage.\n\nThe new model is smarter and cheaper than the previewed February model.\n\nSora features an explore page where users can view each other's creations. Users can click on any video to see how it was created.\n\nA live demo showed the model in use. The demo-ers entered a prompt and picked aspect ratio, duration, and even presets. I found the live demo video results to be realistic and stunning.\n\nOpenAI also unveiled Storyboard, a tool that lets users generate inputs for every frame in a sequence.\n\nFriday, December 6:\n\nOn the second day of \"shipmas,\" OpenAI expanded access to its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research Program:\n\nThe Reinforcement Fine-Tuning program allows developers and machine learning engineers to fine-tune OpenAI models to \"excel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks,\" according to OpenAI.\n\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning refers to a customization technique in which developers can define a model's behavior by inputting tasks and grading the output. The model then uses this feedback as a guide to improve, becoming better at reasoning through similar problems, and enhancing overall accuracy.\n\nOpenAI encourages research institutes, universities, and enterprises to apply to the program, particularly those that perform narrow sets of complex tasks, could benefit from the assistance of AI, and perform tasks that have an objectively correct answer.\n\nSpots are limited; interested applicants can apply by filling out this form.\n\nOpenAI aims to make Reinforcement Fine-Tuning publicly available in early 2025.\n\nThursday, December 5:\n\nOpenAI started with a bang, unveiling two major upgrades to its chatbot: a new tier of ChatGPT subscription, ChatGPT Pro, and the full version of the company's o1 model.\n\nThe full version of o1:\n\nWill be better for all kinds of prompts, beyond math and science\n\nWill make major mistakes about 34% less often than o1-preview, while thinking about 50% faster\n\nRolls out today, replacing o1-preview to all ChatGPT Plus and now Pro users\n\nLets users input images, as seen in the demo, to provide multi-modal reasoning (reasoning on both text and images)\n\nChatGPT Pro:\n\nIs meant for ChatGPT Plus superusers, granting them unlimited access to the best OpenAI has to offer, including unlimited access to OpenAI o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Mode\n\nFeatures o1 pro mode, which uses more computing to reason through the hardest science and math problems\n\nCosts $200 per month\n\nWhere can you access the live stream?\n\nThe live streams are held on the OpenAI website, and posted to its YouTube channel immediately after. To make access easier, OpenAI will also post a link to the live stream on its X account 10 minutes before it starts, which will be at approximately 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET daily."

            "article_content": "As OpenAI and Google joust this December, with the former\u2019s 12 Days of Innovation challenge, and the latter countering it with its Gemini 2 AI model, I look beyond these skirmishes to predict my Twelve Trends for AI going into 2025 and beyond.\n\nI will describe them over three columns. Each of these has a theme, and today\u2019s four predictions are around how humans and AI will draw closer to each other\u2014in work, life and relationships.\n\nAlso read: Indian software majors need a clear strategy to ride the AI wave\n\nPrediction One of Twelve\u2014English is the new coding: As our generation was growing up, we were told that learning English was the passport to success. We did that and were arguably successful in our careers and businesses. Our children in turn are told that learning how to code is the passport to success, thus coding is the new English.\n\nThis led to 10-year-olds being dragged to code camps to learn Python and JavaScript. With Generative AI, this changes: Every time we write an English prompt for ChatGPT or any of its ilk, we are actually \u2018coding: i.e., giving it a set of instructions to perform some task for us, whether it\u2019s a summarization, video-creation or a write-up.\n\nExcept that now we are doing it in our natural human language rather than the language of the machine. This is profound, as it has the potential to democratize coding and make eight billion of us code. Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella declaimed that instead of learning the machine\u2019s language, machines would have to learn ours.\n\nJensen Huang of Nvidia joined the chorus saying that the true potential of AI is that none of us would have to learn how to code. Thus, English, or any other natural language, becomes the new coding language.\n\nPrediction Two of Twelve\u2014AI is the new UI: AI will become the new user interface. Bill Gates presciently wrote in November 2023 (bit.ly/3tSMNkB): \u201c\u2026you won\u2019t have to use different apps for different tasks. You\u2019ll simply tell your device, in everyday language, what you want to do.\"\n\nA UI has been how humans and machines have interacted with each other, as the difficult UIs of machine language and DOS (disk operating system) gave way to a GUI (graphical user interface), search bars, browsers and apps. Simpler UI led to a faster, intuitive and more productive interaction with a machine.\n\nThe AI-driven shift will lead to voice UI as the spoken word becomes the new way to interact with machines, similar to our interactions with other humans. We will chat with ChatGPT or Gemini to work with them on our day-to-day tasks.\n\nOur devices will morph, with voice becoming the primary interface rather than a large screen. The first proto-devices are already out, though not terribly successful, like the Rabbit R1 and AI Pin. An AI assistant becomes the UI.\n\nPrediction Three of Twelve\u2014AI and humans are the new creators: GenAI is a cognitive technology and can do creative tasks like writing, creating art and composing poetry. This has left many human creators deeply worried about their jobs as creativity was supposed to be a uniquely human skill. I believe, however, that Generative AI will boost human creativity.\n\nTake OpenAI\u2019s Sora, for instance, released last week. When Sam Altman had teased it a year back, he had invited creative prompts on X to instantly generate videos with it. Indian entrepreneur Kunal Shah famously gave \u2018A bicycle race on ocean with different animals as athletes riding the bicycles with drone camera view\u2019 and Sora produced a spectacular video (bit.ly/3ZgGnHD).\n\nHowever, it was not Sora that was being creative, but Kunal, who would not have imagined a creation like this unless he had a tool like Sora or Runway to manifest his innate human creativity. Thus, I believe that a combination of humans and AI will give rise to a new era of creativity.\n\nPrediction Four of Twelve\u2014AI creates a new customer: The Industrial revolution brought with it the transactional Industrial customer who rarely used technology, and the internet brought the digital comparison-driven and social customer who searched and clicked her way through brands.\n\nAlso read: These 4 AI stocks could see incredible growth in 2025\n\nA new kind of customer will emerge in this age of AI\u2014someone who lives in the era of infinite hyper-personalized choice and has immersive and conversational interaction with brands, AI that anticipates her needs and brand relationships that are collaborative rather than functional or emotional (bit.ly/4ffrueN).\n\nThis will mean a big change in business and marketing as they adjust to this reality.\n\nThe next set of predictions will be around what I consider the biggest trend of 2025\u2014Agentic AI. Here is a video (bit.ly/4fnaJ1h) that offers more."

            "article_content": "This year, Rockefeller scientists illuminated the mysteries of memory and immune evasion. They unraveled how cancer infiltrates the body, how vitamin A influences wound healing, and how the impulse to eat is driven by three neurons. Groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, CRISPR technology, and stem cell biology reflect an impressive year for advancement in biomedicine. Here are some of the intriguing discoveries that came out of Rockefeller in 2024.\n\nVitamin A's healing role\n\nIt turns out Vitamin A is playing an unexpected role in wound repair: hair follicle stem cells are involved in the healing process in a way mediated by retinoic acid, the active form of Vitamin A. A study from the laboratory of Elaine Fuchs found that, during this process, stem cells enter a temporary state of plasticity in which they adopt traits of multiple cell types. Given that an unchecked version of this kind of plasticity is present in some cancer stem cells, the findings raise the possibility that retinoids could also play a role in cancer suppression.\n\n\"This hasn't been on the radar until now,\" Fuchs says. \"It's an exciting front to now investigate.\"\n\nMemory's hidden architect\n\nRobert B. Darnell's lab unveiled a tool edging neuroscience much closer to understanding a phenomenon known as dendritic translation-a \"holy grail for understanding memory formation,\" he says. Dendritic translation is a coordinated burst of neuronal activity, which involves an uptick in localized protein production within the spiny branches that project off the neuron cell body and receive signals from other neurons at synapses. It's a process key to memory-and its dysfunction is linked to intellectual disorders.\n\nUsing a new platform they developed, Darnell's team identified several previously unknown regulatory mechanisms that drive dendritic translation. The work \"defines a whole new biochemical pathway which fits with, complements, and vastly expands what we already knew about memory and learning,\" Darnell says.\n\nAutism's missing link\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is tied to more than 70 genes, and the laboratory of Mary E. Hatten has long focused on the link between the ASTN2 gene and cerebellar changes in children with autism, as well as other neurodevelopmental conditions. This year, however, Hatten's lab took that work to the next level with research demonstrating that knocking out ASTN2 in mice induces hallmark autism-like behaviors, including reduced vocalization, diminished social interaction, increased hyperactivity, and repetitive actions.\n\n\"It's a big finding in the field of neuroscience,\" Hatten says, and one that is inspiring her team to delve deeper into the hereditary components of autism. \"We're very excited that we've been able to show in detail what ASTN2 does, but there are a lot more genes to investigate.\"\n\nMetastasis's surprising origins\n\nA pair of compelling studies from the Tavazoie lab challenged conventional wisdom around cancer metastasis. Earlier this year, the lab demonstrated that sensory neurons play a direct role in promoting the growth and spread of breast cancer, providing the first ever evidence of peripheral nerves releasing a signal to enhance metastasis.\n\nMost recently, Tavazoie's team demonstrated, for the first time, that breast cancer metastasis may be, in part, a hereditary disorder driven by mutations in an inherited gene variant common to about 70 percent of white women. The scientists note their finding isn't cause for alarm-the variant does not make people more likely to develop cancer, though it may up the risk for metastasis outcomes by between 2 to 22 percent-but it could open up a new pathway to treatment.\n\n\"We've been so focused on the cancer cells, the 'seeds,' that we've ignored the germline-the 'soil',\" Tavazoie explains. \"It's now clear that focusing on the soil is critical.\"\n\nCRISPR's new tricks\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 has long been likened to a kind of genetic scissors, thanks to its ability to snip out any desired section of DNA with elegant precision. Now, thanks to work done in the lab of Luciano Marraffini, we know that certain CRISPR systems operate something like a molecular fumigator as well: In a collaboration with MSKCC, the team found a CRISPR system that also produces a flood of toxic molecules in response invading phages or plasmids, effectively shutting down the infected cell in order to prevent the contagion from spreading through the rest of the bacterial population.\n\n\"It's a completely brand-new type of CRISPR chemistry,\" says Christian Baca, a graduate student in the Marraffini lab. The group envisions one possible application of their discovery may be a diagnostic tool for infection-but it hints at much more. \"It's more evidence that CRISPR systems have an array of immune strategies at their disposal.\"\n\nTelomere's balancing act\n\nTelomeres, the protective caps found at chromosome ends, must be kept at just the right length: too short, and dangerously accelerated aging ensues; too long, and they predispose their owners to cancer. Precise regulation is paramount, and Titia de Lange's laboratory recently published work that fundamentally changes our understanding of telomere biology.\n\nAmong their findings, de Lange's team discovered that two enzymes work in concert to ensure proper telomere maintenance. Scientists knew the telomerase enzyme helps prevent telomeres from growing shorter with each round of replication. But every DNA double helix has two strands to copy, and telomerase is capable of handling only one. Her team demonstrated how a second enzyme-the CST-Pol\u03b1-primase complex-manages the other strand."

The antimatter particle is the partner of a massive matter particle called hyperhelium-4, and its discovery could help scientists tackle the mystery of why regular matter came to dominate the universe, despite the fact that matter and antimatter were created in equal amounts at the dawn of time.\n\nThis imbalance is known as \"matter-antimatter asymmetry.\" Matter particles and antimatter particles annihilate on contact, releasing their energy back into the cosmos. That implies that if an imbalance between the two hadn't arisen early in the universe, then the cosmos may have been a much emptier and less interesting place indeed.\n\nThe LHC is no stranger to paradigm-shifting discoveries about the early universe. Running in a 17-mile (27-kilometer) long loop beneath the Alps near Geneva, Switzerland, the LHC is most famous for its discovery of the Higgs Boson particle, the \"messenger\" of the Higgs Field responsible for giving other particles their mass at the dawn of time.\n\nThe collisions that occur at the LHC generate a state of matter called \"quark-gluon plasma.\" This dense sea of plasma is the same as the \"primordial soup\" of matter that filled the universe around one-millionth of a second after the Big Bang.\n\nExotic \"hypernuclei\" and their antimatter counterparts emerge from this quark-gluon plasma, allowing scientists a glimpse at the conditions of the early universe.\n\nRelated: World's smallest particle accelerator is 54 million times smaller than the Large Hadron Collider, and it works\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

However, they are rarely found in nature and are difficult to create and study in the lab. This has made them somewhat mysterious.\n\nAn image of the ALICE detector taken during LHC upgrades in 2019 (Image credit: Robert Lea)\n\nThe discovery of the first evidence of the hypernuclei that is an antimatter counterpart of hyperhelium-4 was made at the LHC detector ALICE.\n\n\n\nWhile most of the nine experiments at the LHC, each with its own detector, generate their results by slamming together protons at near the speed of light, the ALICE collaboration creates quark-gluon plasma by slamming together much heavier particles, usually lead nuclei, or \"ions.\"\n\n\n\nThe collision of iron ions (try saying that ten times fast) is ideal for generating significant amounts of hypernuclei. Yet until recently, scientists conducting heavy-ion collisions had only succeeded in observing the lightest hypernucleus, hypertriton, and its antimatter partner, antihypertriton.\n\nThat was until earlier in 2024 when scientists used the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in New York to detect antihyperhydrogen-4, which is composed of an antiproton, two antineutrons, and a quark-containing particle called an \"antilambda.\"\n\nNow, ALICE has followed this with the detection of a heavier anti-hypernuclei particle, antihyperhelium-4, composed of two antiprotons, an antineutron, and an antilambda.\n\nAn illustration of antimatter particles entering the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider.

Kwauka)\n\nThe lead-lead collision and the ALICE data that yielded the detection of the heaviest antimatter hypernucleus yet at the LHC actually date back to 2018.\n\nThe signature of antihyperhelium-4 was revealed by its decay into other particles and the detection of these particles.\n\n\n\nALICE scientists teased the signature of antihyperhelium-4 out of the data using a machine-learning technique that can outperform the collaboration's usual search techniques.\n\nIn addition to spotting evidence of antihyperhelium-4 and antihyperhydrogen-4, the ALICE team was also able to determine their masses, which were in good agreement with current particle physics theories.\n\nThe scientists were also able to determine the amounts of these particles produced in lead-lead collisions.\n\nThey found these numbers consistent with the ALICE data, which indicates that antimatter and matter are produced in equal amounts from quark-gluon plasma produced at the energy levels the LHC is capable of reaching.\n\nThe reason for the universe's matter/antimatter imbalance remains unknown, but antihyperhelium-4 and antihyperhydrogen-4 could provide important clues in this mystery."

            "article_content": "Rohan Doctor was a managing director at Goldman Sachs when he founded Louisa AI.\n\nThe startup uses AI to feed deal ideas and networking prompts to bankers and investors.\n\nHere's why he wants to bring the dealmaking playbook to startups.\n\nCold call after cold call, Rohan Doctor wasn't getting as far as he would've hoped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs managing director had emailed a list of digital strategy execs at banks and private equity firms to try to sell them on his startup, Louisa AI. But he only got a handful of replies back.\n\nTwo years since its launch, Louisa AI has secured about a dozen clients, including some of the biggest names in corporate America. They include Goldman Sachs, VC firm Insight Partners, and, more recently, one of the biggest AI chipmakers and a top consulting firm. But he didn't secure those contracts from cold outreach. He used his own startup's technology, which proactively prompts deal ideas based on people's personal and professional connections, to get in through the front door.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Doctor wants to bring his dealmaking playbook to other startups ahead of an anticipated M&A boom.\n\n\"If we're able to close more deals through warm relationships this way, then other startups can, too,\" he said.\n\nThe near-term outlook for M&A activity has gotten brighter, with lower interest rates reducing the cost of borrowing. Wall Street execs are optimistic that Trump's return to the White House, and any business-friendly regulations that may come with it, will be a tailwind for dealmaking. Also, companies resetting their valuations could spur more transactions to close as price expectations align between buyers and sellers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, in Silicon Valley, VCs and founders are hopeful about the anticipated looser environment, which could boost tech building and dealmaking. VCs, which rely on selling startups in M&A deals for many of their returns, have been dampened by the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust stance on M&A.\n\nLouisa AI was built to suggest potential deals based on the data it's exposed to. It ingests information about who and what employees know by plugging into company CRMs, messaging platforms like Slack and Symphony, and email providers. Since spinning out of Goldman Sachs in 2023, Louisa AI has raised $5 million in seed funding. It suggests about $1 billion in deal values per quarter, Doctor said.\n\nIt also highlights mutual connections to establish a warm introduction, which can make all the difference in the multi-billion investment banking industry built on relationships. While running the bank-solutions group at Goldman Sachs, Rohan Doctor used his network to close transactions worth tens of millions of dollars. As a startup founder, it's been a different story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I've tried the cold outreach and just emailing,\" Doctor said, adding that the startup stopped doing that after it didn't yield good results. What has worked for Doctor is realizing he knows someone who knows someone.\n\nLouisa AI scored the chipmaker contract after the AI flagged that one of Doctor's staff used to work for someone who now worked at the chip manufacturer. With the consultancy, one of Louisa AI's investors connected Doctor with the consulting firm they used to work for. He declined to name these firms due to non-disclosure agreements.\n\n\"Everything needs to be warm when it comes to big companies doing big things with other people. It has to rely on trust,\" he said."

His articles and interviews with industry leaders have earned him recognition as a key influencer by organisations like Onalytica. Under his leadership, publications have been praised by analyst firms such as Forrester for their excellence and performance. Connect with him on X (@gadget_ry), Bluesky (@gadgetry.bsky.social), and/or Mastodon (@gadgetry@techhub.social)\n\nAs the world races towards 2025, Developer examines what lies ahead for software development in the new year.\n\nAmong the most pressing trends for 2025 are AI development simplification, the integration of cross-functional engineering teams, and the evolution of DevSecOps practices. These shifts promise to redefine how companies approach innovation, security, and efficiency in their development pipelines.\n\nAI-powered development simplification\n\nAvthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale, predicts a significant transformation in the tech stack landscape by 2025.\n\n\u201cThe traditional tech stack will continue to collapse,\u201d Sewrathan notes, highlighting advancements driven by APIs and tools that reduce complexity and enable faster development. This shift is anticipated to empower engineers of all skill levels to create impactful AI applications with ease.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, the traditional tech stack will continue to collapse, fueled by APIs and tools that reduce complexity and enable faster development,\u201d Sewrathan explains. \u201cCompanies that deliver frictionless, accessible solutions with low barriers to entry will empower engineers to create impactful AI apps, no matter their level of expertise.\u201d\n\nThis democratisation of AI app creation is expected to increase competition within the industry as more developers gain access to advanced capabilities. Consistency and reliability in AI applications are also set to become paramount.\n\n\u201cAs AI apps become central to everyday interactions in 2025, consistency and reliability will take precedence,\u201d Sewrathan observes.\n\nDeveloper role evolution\n\nIndu Keri, General Manager and Head of Engineering for Hybrid Cloud at Nutanix, envisions a new era of software development starting in 2025.\n\n\u201cSoftware development and engineering is already being democratised with tools like Copilot,\u201d Keri says.\n\nBy combining GenAI with low-code solutions, code will be abstracted to the point of irrelevance. AI will generate applications rather than code, enabling developers to step into strategic roles.\n\n\u201cThe day-to-day for developers will change drastically,\u201d Keri notes. \u201cNo longer hamstrung by grunt work, developers will step into an up-leveled, strategic role\u2014communicating with decision-makers about how tech can solve business problems.\u201d\n\nThis evolution, Keri argues, complements developers\u2019 best qualities \u2013 creativity and innovation \u2013 and challenges them to grow into leadership roles within their organisations.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, engineers at any level will be able to create an AI app through the widespread availability of APIs and models,\u201d Sewrathan adds. \u201cBut the differentiators will be consistency, usability, and customer impact.\u201d\n\nAgentic AI and DevOps automation\n\nThe hype around agentic AI will reach boiling point in 2025 as organisations bundle specialised agents for different stages of software delivery, including code generation, testing, and quality assurance. This orchestrator-driven approach will drive a more intelligent approach to DevOps automation.\n\nMartin Reynolds, Field CTO of Harness, says: \u201cInstead of having one, basic GenAI assistant, organisations will bundle together specialised agents for the different stages of software delivery\u2014such as code generation, testing, and quality assurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne agent will act as the orchestrator, directing the others and producing more accurate insights into the end-to-end process.\u201d\n\nRodrigo Coutinho of OutSystems highlights that agentic AI will answer many, but not all, business problems: \u201cFor the last few years, businesses have tried to throw GenAI at all of their problems. The result: GenAI is a remarkable solution for many use cases, but not everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn AI tool is only as good as the data it\u2019s trained on. Just because tech titans are pushing agentic AI right now doesn\u2019t mean you should scrap simpler solutions. Align your AI strategy with your organisation\u2019s needs, rather than the latest shiny object.\u201d\n\nIntegration of cross-functional engineering teams\n\nMoving beyond AI development, the prediction for cross-functional engineering teams is another area of significant change. Reynolds outlines a future where standalone DevOps teams are phased out in favour of more holistic groups that include representation from all engineering disciplines.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, organisations will move away from standalone DevOps teams towards more holistic groups that include representation from all engineering disciplines,\u201d Reynolds explains.\n\nThis shift towards unified cross-functional teams is expected to eliminate the remaining silos between software delivery teams and accelerate innovation at a whole new level. To support these integrated teams, organisations will increasingly adopt unified platforms providing capabilities across the entire software delivery lifecycle\u2014from CI/CD to chaos engineering and cloud cost management.\n\nIn line with these platform shifts, Reynolds emphasises the importance of Internal Developer Portals (IDPs) that enable engineers to self-serve the solutions and data they need.\n\n\u201cTo maximise the value of these platforms,\u201d Reynolds advises,\u201c[organisations] will expose these capabilities through IDPs.\u201d\n\nEvolution of DevSecOps practices\n\nThe software development landscape is also witnessing a significant evolution in DevSecOps practices.\n\nDylan Thomas, Senior Director of Product Engineering at OpenText Cybersecurity, predicts that, by 2025, DevSecOps will evolve beyond the \u201cshift-left\u201d paradigm to embrace a more mature \u201cshift everywhere\u201d approach.\n\nThis shift will require organisations to apply the right tools at the right stages of the DevSecOps cycle, improving efficiency and effectiveness in security practices.\n\n\u201cLightweight analysis in IDEs will help developers catch issues early,\u201d Thomas elaborates. \u201cAutomation integrated into pull requests and CI/CD pipelines will ensure a cohesive \u2018integrate once\u2019 approach for core functions such as SAST, SCA, and increasingly DAST, particularly for API security testing.\u201d\n\nThis integration is expected to streamline the development process while enhancing overall security.\n\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM) maturity\n\nOne of the critical components in this evolving landscape is the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).\n\nGovernment mandates are driving organisations to adopt SBOMs at scale, requiring them not only to generate these documents but also to make them actionable.\n\nWhile producing SBOMs in standard formats is now routine, the real challenge lies in translating raw data into meaningful risk-based insights.\n\nDevSecOps practices will mature, leveraging tools like VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange) to add critical context to SBOMs\u2014reducing inefficiencies in vendor-consumer relationships and enhancing overall security posture.\n\nPostgreSQL\u2019s role in managing complex data types\n\nPostgreSQL\u2019s extension capabilities are also anticipated to play a significant role in managing complex data types in one place.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, PostgreSQL will solidify its position as the go-to \u2018everything database\u2019\u2014the first to fully integrate AI functionality like embeddings directly within its core ecosystem,\u201d says Avthar Sewrathan, AI Product Lead at Timescale.\n\n\u201cThis will streamline data workflows, eliminate the need for external processing tools, and enable businesses to manage complex data types in one place.\u201d\n\nAs companies move towards integrated solutions that can handle diverse datasets without relying on standalone or specialised databases, PostgreSQL is leading the charge towards this future state.\n\nDiverse app stores will reshape mobile distribution\n\nThe app store ecosystem is poised for a significant shift as mobile carriers are expected to regain their influence over app distribution.\n\nMatt Tubergen, EVP of Global Strategy & Partnerships at Digital Turbine, said: \u201cThe app store ecosystem is set to shift away from an Apple and Google duopoly to an open landscape as mobile carriers regain the power to connect consumers with apps.\u201d\n\nEmerging regulatory changes are also playing a critical role in leveling the playing field. These include bans that prevent tech giants like Google from incentivising app store preloads, which allow carriers and device manufacturers to preload their own apps on new devices.\n\nThis newfound autonomy positions carriers as pivotal players in alternative app distribution.\n\n\u201cThis renewed autonomy positions carriers as critical players in alternative app distribution, enabling organic growth for alternative app stores,\u201d Tubergen notes.\n\nCarriers are expected to offer developers better revenue opportunities than those provided by Apple and Google, while consumers will benefit from a more diverse selection of apps.\n\nTubergen points out that \u201cthe new, open app store economy will prioritise the needs of developers and users, shifting away from the current model that only serves Apple and Google.\u201d This shift promises a competitive and decentralised landscape where developers gain more control over their revenue streams.\n\nConsumers are expected to enjoy access to a wider variety of apps curated and tailored to their preferences. With third-party app stores gaining influence and major players like Epic Games and Microsoft advocating for inclusivity, the global app distribution model is likely to expand and mirror the thriving alternative stores seen in Asia.\n\nThis evolution promises an inclusive, innovative, and consumer-focused mobile distribution ecosystem.\n\nEmergence of xOps\n\nThe convergence of DevOps, DataOps, and ModelOps into a new \u201cxOps\u201d paradigm is expected as more traditional applications adopt AI capabilities.\n\n\u201cThis new-found set of dependencies will dramatically accelerate \u2018AI-aware\u2019 Release Orchestration while also challenging operations teams, support teams, QA teams, and more as the line between more traditional declarative applications blur with the new dependencies to LLMs and GenAI capabilities,\u201d explains Derek Holt, CEO of Digital.ai.\n\nIncreasing security challenges\n\nWhile AI-generated code can significantly increase developer efficiency, it also introduces security risks due to increased volume of code that must still be tested for vulnerabilities and errors.\n\n\u201cWhile research has shown that generative AI can halve the time it takes developers to complete coding tasks, the increased volume of code being produced must still be tested for vulnerabilities and errors,\u201d warns Holt.\n\n\u201cThis will increase security risk and lead to additional toil in the later stages of delivery, wiping out any efficiency gains from AI-generated code.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, there has been a notable increase in supply-chain attacks. This is likely to continue into 2025 and beyond.\n\nAaron Costello, Chief of SaaS Security Research at AppOmni, observes: \u201cThe past few years, we\u2019ve seen a steady uptick in supply-chain attacks on SaaS through compromised third-party applications. As a result, organisations are placing these integrations and their requested access levels under far more scrutiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy research into data exposures has shown that often no initial foothold is needed for threat actors to gain access to the sensitive data they want. The combination of undocumented legacy API endpoints, over-privileged public access, and gaps in vendor logging capabilities will continue to provide a dangerously effective option for threat actors to execute hit-and-run style attacks.\u201d\n\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny\n\nDespite the increasing security challenges, a failure to secure software could have ever more serious repercussions. In light of increasing awareness and demand for reliable software systems, developers must prepare for heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n\nMartin Reynolds, Field CTO of Harness, comments: \u201cIn the wake of the CrowdStrike outage, there will be an increase in regulatory pressure around poor-quality software.\u201d\n\nGlobal regulators are expected to introduce more stringent standards that extend beyond existing frameworks like the EU\u2019s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). This response is driven by a growing sentiment among consumers; a recent survey conducted by Harness found that ~74% of consumers believe there should be regulations holding companies accountable for poor-quality software updates leading to IT outages.\n\nTo navigate these impending regulatory changes, organisations supporting critical infrastructure \u2013 such as banking, healthcare, and energy services \u2013 must proactively enhance their software testing protocols.\n\n\u201cThey will need well-defined response plans to ensure they can recover quickly when the unexpected happens,\u201d Reynolds notes. Implementing modern software delivery practices is crucial, including feature flags and canary deployments, which enable continuous improvement in code quality and more stable release cycles.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, organisations not only bolster software resilience but also enhance trust and brand loyalty among consumers. As regulations evolve to emphasise software reliability akin to cybersecurity standards, being proactive will be key to supporting business growth and staying ahead of regulatory measures. This approach not only mitigates risks but positions companies favorably in a landscape where quality is increasingly synonymous with competitive advantage.\n\nOverall, the predictions for 2025 paint a picture of an industry bracing for radical transformation\u2014driven by advancements in AI development, cross-functional engineering teams, and mature DevSecOps practices. These changes promise to accelerate innovation while enhancing security and user experience across industries.\n\nSee also: PostgreSQL becomes developers\u2019 choice for AI and real-time apps\n\nLooking to revamp your digital transformation strategy?

We'll likely never have another brain-frying moment, like the jump from 2D to 3D, but lead PlayStation architect Mark Cerny still believes in generational hardware leaps.\n\nWhen asked about whether drastic generational leaps can still exist in an interview with Digital Foundry, Cerny explained that the company isn't producing PCs - they're making consoles that are supposed to give developers a new benchmark. \"We're not making PCs,\" he says. \"We're making a few very specific things, right? How many PCs are there? You can't even answer that question because you can combine the components in any way you want to.\"\n\nTalking about the differences between less dramatic mid-gen refreshes and properly new hardware, Cerny elaborated that consoles like the PS5 Pro \"are very tightly targeted around GPU\" and are designed to push graphics rather than offer anything new on the gameplay side. \"But when a new generation starts, then it gets opened up to 'What are we doing with the CPU? What are we doing with the amount of memory? What are we doing with haptics?' It's a whole new experience that developers can go at.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere in the chat, Cerny mentions that the company's work with machine learning tech will continue after implementing PSSR upscaling, which automatically analyses your screen and improves your image quality, on the PS5 Pro. \"It's been just great digging into the M.L. (machine learning) aspects of this and gaining some knowledge there, because we know that's the future we are heading into,\" he says. \"We're definitely continuing with development of these ML-based libraries for game graphics. It's just that there's so many targets to go up against.\"\n\nJust bought the souped-up console?

            "article_content": "CNN \u2014\n\nFacing intense pressure of the federal government potentially shutting down within days and disaster aid coffers that need replenishment, lawmakers are racing to cobble together a temporary government funding plan after President-elect Donald Trump torpedoed their last package on Wednesday.\n\nThe now-dead agreement would have kept the federal government operating through March 14, as well as provided nearly $100 billion in disaster aid and economic relief for farmers in rural communities. The deal would have also provided lawmakers with their first pay raise since 2009.\n\nHere\u2019s what Americans could soon face if Congress doesn\u2019t reach a deal by midnight on Friday:\n\nAid for disasters and farmers\n\nThe bipartisan deal struck earlier in the week would have provided nearly $100 billion to help Americans trying to recover from multiple natural disasters in 2023 and 2024.\n\nEvery state in the nation was set to get a portion of the funds. States like North Carolina and Florida, which were hit hard by Hurricanes Helene and Milton earlier this year, were expected to get some largest amount of funding, according to a breakdown provided by Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nSome $29 billion would help replenish the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund, which has dwindled after contending with the two hurricanes, as well as other disasters.\n\nThe package also included $21 billion in disaster relief for farmers \u2013 a big sticking point in negotiations earlier this week. Lawmakers from agricultural-focused states have argued that the help is desperately needed as America\u2019s farmers are facing lower commodity prices and higher costs for supplies.\n\nThe spending agreement would have also extended the farm bill \u2013 a sweeping package that governs many agricultural and nutrition assistance programs. Typically, the bill is renewed every five years, but the most recent version was passed in 2018 and the extension lapsed at the end of September.\n\nGovernment shutdown looms\n\nLawmakers have until midnight Friday to fund the federal government \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 to avoid a shutdown. Since Congress has not approved appropriations for any agencies, all would be affected.\n\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget is sending additional guidance to federal agencies on shutdown preparations, an administration official told CNN.\n\nEvery department and agency has its own set of plans and procedures for a shutdown. The plans include how many employees would be furloughed, which employees are considered essential and would work without pay, how long it would take to wind down operations in the hours before a shutdown and which activities would come to a halt. Those plans can vary from shutdown to shutdown.\n\nThe impact of a shutdown differs each time, but the consequences could be felt early. About 875,000 civilian federal workers will be furloughed, while another 1.4 million employees are considered essential and will have to continue working \u2013 most of them without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, which looked at data from September. (They will receive their missed paychecks once the impasse ends.)\n\n\u201cA government shutdown would deliver a devastating blow to hardworking federal employees and the millions of citizens who rely on essential government services,\u201d said Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents more than 800,000 civilian federal employees.\n\n\u201cThese patriotic civil servants are the backbone of our nation \u2014 they inspect our food, protect our borders, ensure safe travel during the holidays, and provide relief to disaster victims,\u201d Kelley continued. \u201cOver 642,000 of them are veterans of our armed services. Allowing them to go without a paycheck over the holidays is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nFederal employees are \u201crattled\u201d by the sudden threat of a shutdown, said Doreen Greenwald, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 workers in three dozen federal agencies and offices. But the move would also have broader consequences.\n\n\u201cShutdowns waste taxpayer money, harm the economy and jeopardize the paychecks and essential services that hardworking Americans and their families depend on every day,\u201d Greenwald said.\n\nPrevious shutdowns have closed national parks and museums, wreaked havoc on the Internal Revenue Service just before the start of the tax filing season, and delayed some federal lending to homebuyers and small businesses, among other impacts. Though air traffic controllers have to remain on the job, many called in sick during the most recent shutdown, snarling flights.\n\nHowever, some agencies can continue certain operations \u2013 and keep paying their employees \u2013 from other sources of funding.\n\nAlso, some essential government functions continue even if the government shuts down. Notably, Social Security recipients would receive their monthly payments, and Medicare and Medicaid benefits would continue.\n\nGovernment agencies had to prepare multiple times for a shutdown during the last fiscal year since Congress repeatedly punted on approving a full funding plan before finally passing one in March.\n\nTrump\u2019s extended shutdown\n\nTrump presided over the longest government shutdown in four decades during his first term. The 35-day impasse, which shuttered part of the government just before Christmas in 2018, ended in late January when Trump agreed to a temporary funding measure that did not include billions of dollars for a border wall.\n\nHowever, the shutdown wreaked havoc on many Americans and federal employees, including causing flight delays, canceling immigration hearings and making it harder for some families to obtain student loans.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Betsy Klein contributed to this report."

            "article_content": "Yet realizing measurable business value from AI-powered applications requires a new game plan. Legacy application architectures simply aren\u2019t capable of meeting the high demands of AI-enhanced applications. Rather, the time is now for organizations to modernize their infrastructure, processes, and application architectures using cloud native technologies to stay competitive.\n\nThe time is now for modernization\n\nToday\u2019s organizations exist in an era of geopolitical shifts, growing competition, supply chain disruptions, and evolving consumer preferences. AI applications can help by supporting innovation, but only if they have the flexibility to scale when needed. Fortunately, by modernizing applications, organizations can achieve the agile development, scalability, and fast compute performance needed to support rapid innovation and accelerate the delivery of AI applications. David Harmon, director of software development for AMD says companies, \u201creally want to make sure that they can migrate their current [environment] and take advantage of all the hardware changes as much as possible.\u201d The result is not only a reduction in the overall development lifecycle of new applications but a speedy response to changing world circumstances.\n\nBeyond building and deploying intelligent apps quickly, modernizing applications, data, and infrastructure can significantly improve customer experience. Consider, for example, Coles, an Australian supermarket that invested in modernization and is using data and AI to deliver dynamic e-commerce experiences to its customers both online and in-store. With Azure DevOps, Coles has shifted from monthly to weekly deployments of applications while, at the same time, reducing build times by hours. What\u2019s more, by aggregating views of customers across multiple channels, Coles has been able to deliver more personalized customer experiences. In fact, according to a 2024 CMSWire Insights report, there is a significant rise in the use of AI across the digital customer experience toolset, with 55% of organizations now using it to some degree, and more beginning their journey.\n\nBut even the most carefully designed applications are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks. If given the opportunity, bad actors can extract sensitive information from machine learning models or maliciously infuse AI systems with corrupt data. \u201cAI applications are now interacting with your core organizational data,\u201d says Surendran. \u201cHaving the right guard rails is important to make sure the data is secure and built on a platform that enables you to do that.\u201d The good news is modern cloud based architectures can deliver robust security, data governance, and AI guardrails like content safety to protect AI applications from security threats and ensure compliance with industry standards.\n\nThe answer to AI innovation\n\nNew challenges, from demanding customers to ill-intentioned hackers, call for a new approach to modernizing applications. \u201cYou have to have the right underlying application architecture to be able to keep up with the market and bring applications faster to market,\u201d says Surendran. \u201cNot having that foundation can slow you down.\u201d\n\nEnter cloud native architecture. As organizations increasingly adopt AI to accelerate innovation and stay competitive, there is a growing urgency to rethink how applications are built and deployed in the cloud. By adopting cloud native architectures, Linux, and open source software, organizations can better facilitate AI adoption and create a flexible platform purpose built for AI and optimized for the cloud. Harmon explains that open source software creates options, \u201cAnd the overall open source ecosystem just thrives on that. It allows new technologies to come into play.\u201d\n\nApplication modernization also ensures optimal performance, scale, and security for AI applications. That\u2019s because modernization goes beyond just lifting and shifting application workloads to cloud virtual machines. Rather, a cloud native architecture is inherently designed to provide developers with the following features:\n\nThe flexibility to scale to meet evolving needs\n\nBetter access to the data needed to drive intelligent apps\n\nAccess to the right tools and services to build and deploy intelligent applications easily\n\nSecurity embedded into an application to protect sensitive data\n\nTogether, these cloud capabilities ensure organizations derive the greatest value from their AI applications. \u201cAt the end of the day, everything is about performance and security,\u201d says Harmon. Cloud is no exception."

            "article_content": "Getty Image\n\nHumans have known the world is not, in fact, flat for thousands of years, but there are still plenty of people who would try to tell you otherwise. That includes a Flat Earther who made the trek to Antarctica to test out a theory about the Sun before being forced to admit he\u2019d missed the mark after being confronted by reality.\n\nThe thinkers of Ancient Greece are commonly credited with being the first to determine the Earth is a globe; Eratosthenes, Pythagoras, and Aristotle are commonly cited when people attempt to identify the initial champion of the theory, but there\u2019s no clear-cut historical evidence that can be used to firmly determine who made the discovery.\n\nWhile the debate was essentially put to rest more than 2,000 years ago, we still live on a decidedly spherical globe that\u2019s nonetheless populated by the \u201cFlat Earthers\u201d who vehemently disagree with that assertion, with most people who fall under that umbrella believing we actually live on a disc-shaped planet surrounded by a massive ice wall that\u2019s located where the so-called \u201ccontinent\u201d of Antarctica exists.\n\nAs is the case with most conspiracy theories, there\u2019s not much you can do to convince Flat Earthers they\u2019re wrong despite the mountain of evidence to the contrary, and they\u2019ll usually dream up some fantastical excuse when confronted with any seemingly ironclad proof their literal worldview doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny.\n\nA pastor from Colorado named Will Duffy recently had the chance to do exactly that when he invited some Flat Earthers to join him in Antarctica for what he dubbed \u201cThe Final Experiment.\u201d\n\nIn addition to being the purported location of the ice wall, the snowy expanse is also a hot topic among Flat Earthers who don\u2019t buy into the idea it\u2019s possible for the Sun to shine above it for a full 24 hours during the summer months in the Southern Hemisphere (a feat that would be impossible if the planet is actually flat).\n\nThe quartet of Flat Earth advocates who made the trip included Jeran Campanella, a high-profile YouTuber in the community who traveled 9,000 miles from California to Antarctica to take part in the live-streamed \u201cexperiment\u201d that proved the Sun doesn\u2019t actually set there at this point in the year.\n\nCampanella got the chance to respond to that development around 31 minutes into the following video, as he acknowledged his YouTube channel might not be as popular among Flat Earthers as it once was before admitting he was incorrect, saying. \u201cSometimes you are wrong in life. I thought there was no 24-hour sun. In fact, I was pretty sure of it\u2026It\u2019s a fact. The sun does circle you.\u201d\n\nHe continued, adding, \u201cI realize that I\u2019ll be called a \u2018shill\u2019 for just saying that. And you know what? If you\u2019re a shill for being honest, so be it. I honestly believed there was no 24-hour sun. I honestly now believe there is.\u201d\n\nCampanella\u2019s fellow Flat Earthers were slightly less willing to admit defeat while acknowledging what they saw but asserting it didn\u2019t necessarily debunk the theory they\u2019re intent on clinging to, which isn\u2019t necessarily a huge surprise.\n\nHowever, you have to give him some credit where credit is due for not even attempting to enter the spin zone."

            "article_content": "Dee and Joe Indiviglio like to go out on their front porch at night, and look up. That\u2019s where they were on Dec. 4, when they saw something they hadn\u2019t seen before above their Middletown, New Jersey, home: a group of lights, moving quickly, strangely all over the sky, for maybe a half-hour or longer.\n\nA few days after that, Dee did something else unusual for her. She uploaded a video of those odd lights to a new-ish app called Enigma. \u201cI usually don\u2019t share anything, ever. Even if I did something crazy. But I don\u2019t know, for some reason, something made me share that night. And I did,\u201d she tells Rolling Stone.\n\nEnigma started out as a tool to capture UFO sightings. \u201cBy using modern technology, we will crowdsolve this age-old mystery together,\u201d the company\u2019s website reads. But in the last month, the company has made a hard pivot to a more modern puzzle, tracking whatever the hell is flying over the Eastern Seaboard, where all sorts of people are claiming to have witnessed something unusual. \u201cSeen a drone? Hundreds are being reported to Enigma,\u201d the top of the site now reads.\n\nEnigma is currently #25 in news in the iPhone app store. Usage of the app is up 40 percent from last month, the company claims, and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of people are using the network. Daily sightings in the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area \u2014 ordinarily just one or two \u2014 hit 37 last week, and more than 250 around the country. The surge says something, and not just about about how much weird stuff we see overhead in an age of cheap drones, or how prone people are to freak the fuck out in our post-rational age. \u201cOfficials (FBI, DHS, and local police) are failing in communications and the internet is rife with misinformation. People need somewhere to go,\u201d the company\u2019s founder tells Rolling Stone via email. She\u2019s hoping that Enigma winds up \u201cfilling the vacuum.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nThe founder only wants to be identified as \u201cA\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m just trying to minimize the crazies that enter my life in the next few months,\u201d she says; it\u2019s a drawback of dealing with a rather, um, intense alien-hunter community. But I\u2019ve verified her identity. She became fascinated with the subject after the military declassified those UFO videos around 2020. Eventually, that led to a start-up, which received backing from well-known venture capital firms like Haystack and Lux Capital. The website went up in January 2023, and the app launched that May. Today, she has a small team, still fewer than 20 people, trying to keep up with the flood of reports. Editor\u2019s picks\n\nEach Enigma submission is geo-tagged, categorized by factors like the shape of the object, the type of movement it made, and how long it was in the sky. Then Enigma gives each one a reliability score on a scale. The report from a ship\u2019s captain in Parsippany, New Jersey, describing a silver disk scored a 62 out of 100. A report out of North Plainfield, New Jersey, from someone who saw \u201c4 different white or sparkly orbs\u201d while \u201cpraying\u201d only netted a 39 out of 100. The Indiviglios\u2019 sighting ranked 58. Joe Indiviglio, a regular stargazer who counts himself as \u201ca little [nerdy] when it comes to aviation,\u201d sounds even more confident than that. \u201cIt\u2019s not like any aircraft that could be man-made,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re standing in our backyard, facing the planes as they\u2019re landing at Newark [Airport], they come in from the west and make a hard left turn,\u201d he continues. The lights he and his wife saw were \u201cnowhere in a flight path. [They were] more towards the ocean \u2026 definitely more towards the coast, away from Newark.\u201d\n\nAn FBI official told reporters earlier this week that they\u2019d received about 5,000 tips, fewer than 100 of which were credible enough for follow-up investigation. \u201cThe sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones,\u201d added John Kirby, the National Security Council spokesperson. \u201cWe have not identified anything anomalous or any national security or public safety risk.\u201d Related Content\n\nRebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department\u2019s intelligence chief, told reporters that amateur sleuths trying to probe the mystery lights with drones of their own might actually be feeding a sense of hysteria. \u201cYou can create the public safety threat that you\u2019re trying to investigate,\u201d she said.\n\nA version of that argument is what worries some observers about Enigma. When I was first introduced to Enigma Labs in the summer of 2023, the company promised they were on the verge of getting officially endorsed by NASA. That endorsement never came, though an agency report endorsed the idea of an app for collecting UFO sightings. I also spoke with a number of science writers at the time who were wary of the project. It wasn\u2019t just that eyewitnesses can be shockingly unreliable, especially about lights flashing in the sky. It was the idea of combining what should be the most serious of scientific questions \u2014 are we alone? \u2014 with the dopamine chase of a social network. It didn\u2019t seem like a recipe for rock-solid information. But, as A points out, people are sharing their sightings anyway; at least Enigma applies some rigor to the clips. \u201cThink about the incentives on Facebook or Twitter, where people are more likely to do something because they want likes or they want to be famous or they want engagement,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be famous or go viral because of us. Everyone goes through a standard reporting process where you have to report basic facts. Like, we need the time, we need the location, we need standard descriptions. And we\u2019re looking at the metadata, we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t have deepfakes.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Enigma\n\nSome of the biggest peddlers of drone hokum have been elected officials. There\u2019s the Republican congressman who swore the drones were being dispatched from an Iranian mothership; the Democratic senator who swore he saw something UFO-y in the sky \u2014 only to later admit it was just plain-old planes; the former governor who posted a video of \u201cwhat appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky above my residence\u201d \u2014 turns out, it was the constellation of Orion. Rep. Nancy Mace, notorious in Washington for her attention-seeking antics, tried to hop in on the drone panic by publicly speculating whether the objects were \u201cfrom outer space.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is not exactly camera-shy, proclaimed that he was \u201ctaking to the Senator floor \u2026 to respond to the reports of drone activity.\u201d President-elect Donald Trump, never one to leave a news cycle without his imprint, posted, \u201cMystery Drone sightings all over the Country. Can this really be happening without our government\u2019s knowledge. I don\u2019t think so! Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\u201d\n\nThis may be getting some significant public attention, but it isn\u2019t the first time such concerns have gripped D.C. Over 17 days last December, a squadron of a dozen or more drones buzzed by Langley Air Force Base, home of the U.S. military\u2019s top-of-the-line F-22 stealth fighters. That October, five drones appeared above a Department of Energy nuclear test site in Nevada. Officials from the Pentagon, Department of Energy, and FBI are still stumped about who\u2019s behind the incursions, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Enigma founder says she was in Washington, D.C., the other day, mostly talking to folks on Capitol Hill. The guesses about what these sightings might be ran \u201cthe full gamut\u201d from secret military project to \u201c\u2018Oh, these are just hobbyist drones, or commercial delivery drones.\u2019 Which is bananas to me, because nobody\u2019s getting a burrito from Amazon these days.\u201d\n\nIf A has a favorite explanation, she\u2019s disinclined to share it. But one explanation she completely rejects is that everyone is just mistaken, and all at once. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s a general part of the public that does get confused. They look at a Starlink [mini satellite] and they think it\u2019s an alien. But that is definitely not 100 percent of what\u2019s going on. And not everyone is confused by airplanes. It\u2019s not just mass hysteria. There is a percentage of the activity that is real,\u201d she tells me.\n\n\u201cAnd of the reports we get, a lot of them describe objects that are very large. You know, this is not a DJI drone, right?\u201d she adds, referring to the popular mini-drone maker. \u201cSo that\u2019s the stuff we pay attention to. We did an analysis last week. We found, like, 54 percent of things reported to us were described as hovering. So that\u2019s not plane activity.\u201d\n\nThe Indiviglios were hoping to find a little confirmation on Enigma that others saw just what they did. \u201cI can\u2019t find any. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kind of freaked out,\u201d Dee says. It\u2019s especially disconcerting, because she keeps seeing something strange up above. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them three times now. The latest was earlier this week. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, here we go again.\u2019\u201d"

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nCredit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain\n\nA new study published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, unveils a novel approach to measuring public attention using reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). The research bridges the gap between unconventional indicators and macroeconomic analysis, revealing surprising links between UAP sightings and economic conditions at multiple geographical levels in the United States.\n\nThe study highlights that UAP reports, often dismissed as a niche phenomenon, serve as a robust proxy for public attention. By analyzing daily-level data from NUFORC (National UFO Reporting Center), the researchers show that UAP sightings are more frequent in wealthier regions but exhibit counter-cyclical patterns within those regions over time. These findings suggest that shifts in attention to extraordinary phenomena may reflect broader fluctuations in public focus.\n\nKey findings include:\n\nMacroeconomic correlation: UAP sightings are positively correlated with economic conditions across regions but display counter-cyclical patterns within regions over time.\n\nCausal evidence: A quasi-experimental design leveraging variations in COVID-19 lockdown restrictions demonstrates a causal link between restricted mobility and increased UAP reports, further establishing the measure as an indicator of public attention.\n\nPolicy implications: Regions with higher UAP sighting levels show muted responses to monetary policy shocks, suggesting that attention variations can significantly influence economic outcomes.\n\nThe researchers compared UAP sightings to conventional attention metrics, finding strong correlations. This innovative measure offers unique advantages, including the ability to analyze attention at different geographical and temporal scales.\n\nImplications for policy and research\n\nGoldstein and Raveh's findings underscore the central role of public attention in economic dynamics. Their work not only enhances the toolkit for macroeconomic analysis but also provides policymakers with insights into managing public attention to mitigate economic shocks.\n\nThe study invites further exploration into how unconventional forms of attention, like UAP sightings, intersect with economic behaviors. \"We hope this work inspires future research to deepen our understanding of the connection between public attention and macroeconomic outcomes,\" the authors state.\n\nThe research uses comprehensive UAP sighting data from NUFORC, spanning over two decades, to construct a daily-level panel of reports across U.S. counties. The analysis integrates economic, social, and environmental factors to ensure robust conclusions.\n\nThis pioneering work highlights the value of thinking beyond traditional metrics, shedding light on the role of seemingly unrelated phenomena in understanding economic patterns.\n\nMore information: Nathan Goldstein et al, Looking up the sky: unidentified aerial phenomena and macroeconomic attention, Humanities and Social Sciences Communications (2024).

            "article_content": "This year, Rockefeller scientists illuminated the mysteries of memory and immune evasion. They unraveled how cancer infiltrates the body, how vitamin A influences wound healing, and how the impulse to eat is driven by three neurons. Groundbreaking discoveries in neuroscience, CRISPR technology, and stem cell biology reflect an impressive year for advancement in biomedicine. Here are some of the intriguing discoveries that came out of Rockefeller in 2024.\n\nVitamin A's healing role\n\nIt turns out Vitamin A is playing an unexpected role in wound repair: hair follicle stem cells are involved in the healing process in a way mediated by retinoic acid, the active form of Vitamin A. A study from the laboratory of Elaine Fuchs found that, during this process, stem cells enter a temporary state of plasticity in which they adopt traits of multiple cell types. Given that an unchecked version of this kind of plasticity is present in some cancer stem cells, the findings raise the possibility that retinoids could also play a role in cancer suppression.\n\n\"This hasn't been on the radar until now,\" Fuchs says. \"It's an exciting front to now investigate.\"\n\nMemory's hidden architect\n\nRobert B. Darnell's lab unveiled a tool edging neuroscience much closer to understanding a phenomenon known as dendritic translation-a \"holy grail for understanding memory formation,\" he says. Dendritic translation is a coordinated burst of neuronal activity, which involves an uptick in localized protein production within the spiny branches that project off the neuron cell body and receive signals from other neurons at synapses. It's a process key to memory-and its dysfunction is linked to intellectual disorders.\n\nUsing a new platform they developed, Darnell's team identified several previously unknown regulatory mechanisms that drive dendritic translation. The work \"defines a whole new biochemical pathway which fits with, complements, and vastly expands what we already knew about memory and learning,\" Darnell says.\n\nAutism's missing link\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is tied to more than 70 genes, and the laboratory of Mary E. Hatten has long focused on the link between the ASTN2 gene and cerebellar changes in children with autism, as well as other neurodevelopmental conditions. This year, however, Hatten's lab took that work to the next level with research demonstrating that knocking out ASTN2 in mice induces hallmark autism-like behaviors, including reduced vocalization, diminished social interaction, increased hyperactivity, and repetitive actions.\n\n\"It's a big finding in the field of neuroscience,\" Hatten says, and one that is inspiring her team to delve deeper into the hereditary components of autism. \"We're very excited that we've been able to show in detail what ASTN2 does, but there are a lot more genes to investigate.\"\n\nMetastasis's surprising origins\n\nA pair of compelling studies from the Tavazoie lab challenged conventional wisdom around cancer metastasis. Earlier this year, the lab demonstrated that sensory neurons play a direct role in promoting the growth and spread of breast cancer, providing the first ever evidence of peripheral nerves releasing a signal to enhance metastasis.\n\nMost recently, Tavazoie's team demonstrated, for the first time, that breast cancer metastasis may be, in part, a hereditary disorder driven by mutations in an inherited gene variant common to about 70 percent of white women. The scientists note their finding isn't cause for alarm-the variant does not make people more likely to develop cancer, though it may up the risk for metastasis outcomes by between 2 to 22 percent-but it could open up a new pathway to treatment.\n\n\"We've been so focused on the cancer cells, the 'seeds,' that we've ignored the germline-the 'soil',\" Tavazoie explains. \"It's now clear that focusing on the soil is critical.\"\n\nCRISPR's new tricks\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 has long been likened to a kind of genetic scissors, thanks to its ability to snip out any desired section of DNA with elegant precision. Now, thanks to work done in the lab of Luciano Marraffini, we know that certain CRISPR systems operate something like a molecular fumigator as well: In a collaboration with MSKCC, the team found a CRISPR system that also produces a flood of toxic molecules in response invading phages or plasmids, effectively shutting down the infected cell in order to prevent the contagion from spreading through the rest of the bacterial population.\n\n\"It's a completely brand-new type of CRISPR chemistry,\" says Christian Baca, a graduate student in the Marraffini lab. The group envisions one possible application of their discovery may be a diagnostic tool for infection-but it hints at much more. \"It's more evidence that CRISPR systems have an array of immune strategies at their disposal.\"\n\nTelomere's balancing act\n\nTelomeres, the protective caps found at chromosome ends, must be kept at just the right length: too short, and dangerously accelerated aging ensues; too long, and they predispose their owners to cancer. Precise regulation is paramount, and Titia de Lange's laboratory recently published work that fundamentally changes our understanding of telomere biology.\n\nAmong their findings, de Lange's team discovered that two enzymes work in concert to ensure proper telomere maintenance. Scientists knew the telomerase enzyme helps prevent telomeres from growing shorter with each round of replication. But every DNA double helix has two strands to copy, and telomerase is capable of handling only one. Her team demonstrated how a second enzyme-the CST-Pol\u03b1-primase complex-manages the other strand."

            "article_content": "A recent groundbreaking experiment in which anesthesia was administered to rats has convinced some scientists that tiny structures in the rodents\u2019 brains are responsible for the experience of consciousness. To pull it off, microscopic hollow tube structures called \u201cmicrotubules\u201d perform some advanced physics; the experts believe microtubules perform incredible operations in the quantum realm. Citing the work of earlier researchers, the study infers that the same kinds of quantum operations are likely happening in the human brain.\n\nDuring their rat brain experiments, scientists at Wellesley College in Massachusetts gave the rodents isoflurane, a type of inhaled general anesthetic used to induce and maintain unconsciousness for medical procedures. One group of drugged rats also received microtubule-stabilizing drugs, while the other did not. The researchers discovered that the microtubule-stabilizing molecules kept the rats conscious for longer than the nonstabilized rats, which more quickly lost their \u201crighting reflex,\u201d or the ability to restore normal posture, according to the group\u2019s findings, which were published in the peer-reviewed journal eNeuro in August 2024.\n\nThe Wellesley study is significant because the physical source of consciousness has been a mystery for decades. It\u2019s a major step toward verifying a theory that our brains perform quantum operations, and that this ability generates our consciousness\u2014an idea that\u2019s been gaining traction over the past three decades.\n\nThe notion that quantum physics must be the underlying mechanism for consciousness first emerged in the 1990s, when Nobel Prize\u2013winning physicist Roger Penrose, PhD, and anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff, MD, popularized the idea that neural microtubules enable quantum processes in our brain, giving rise to consciousness. Specifically, they postulated in a 1996 paper that consciousness may operate as a quantum wave passing through the brain\u2019s microtubules. This is known as Orch OR theory, referring to the ability of microtubules to perform quantum computations through a mathematical process Penrose calls \u201cobjective reduction.\u201d\n\nIn quantum physics, a particle does not exist in the way classical physics observes it, with a definite physical location. Instead, it exists as a cloud of probabilities. If it comes into contact with its environment, as when a measuring apparatus observes it, then the particle loses its \u201csuperposition\u201d of multiple states. It collapses into a definite, measurable state, the state in which it was observed. Penrose hypothesized that \u201ceach time a quantum-wave function collapses in this way in the brain, it gives rise to a moment of conscious experience.\u201d\n\nIf this quantum theory of consciousness tied to microtubules turns out to be correct, it could revolutionize our understanding of consciousness and even strengthen the trailblazing theory that consciousness, on a quantum level, is capable of being in all places at the same time. In other words, it can exist everywhere simultaneously, suggesting that your own consciousness can hypothetically connect with quantum particles beyond your brain, maybe entangling with consciousness all across the universe.\n\nMany scientists disregard the Orch OR theory because quantum effects have only been produced in the lab under extremely cold conditions. For example, our technology now includes quantum computers, but their operations rely on temperatures near absolute zero (around minus 273 degrees Celsius) to maintain their quantum states. The warm brain falls well outside those limits, at about 32 to 40 degrees Celsius (about 90 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the deepest regions of the brain, according to a 2022 study. Yet scientists have collected a promising set of data over the years indicating that certain quantum-level operations in animals and plants may actually be responsible for life\u2019s functions.\n\nFor example, scientists theorize that plants, which live at temperatures far warmer than absolute zero, probably use quantum processes to efficiently convert light into energy. First, plants transform photons, or light particles, into a form of matter called excitons, transporting them to the plant\u2019s chloroplasts to start photosynthesis. During this journey, the excitons must navigate around other internal plant structures\u2014fast enough to preserve their energy all the way to their destination. Scientists suggest that plants must use the quantum property of superposition in order to try all possible paths simultaneously. That way, excitons can arrive at their destination in the most efficient way possible.\n\nSimilarly, it may make sense for the billions of neurons firing simultaneously in the human brain to work under the \u201caction over a distance\u201d property of quantum entanglement\u2014the potential for two particles that are very far away from each other to be connected. Scientists have observed this phenomenon in atomic particles before. When they studied one particle, another very distant particle changed its properties as well, even though the two were not apparently connected in any way. An August 2024 study in the journal Physics Review E proposes that a fatty material called myelin, which sheathes the brain cell\u2019s axon, provides the ideal environment for this entanglement. Since the brain appears to be capable of performing quantum operations to facilitate our thoughts, some scientists surmise that this process gives rise to our consciousness.\n\nTwo earlier landmark studies also support a quantum perspective on consciousness. Both involved experiments shining light particles into microtubules and observing that the signal did not degrade. In fact, according to these studies, the experiments demonstrated that quantum states in microtubule signaling can and probably do exist.\n\nOne of the studies, an experiment by physicist and oncology professor Jack Tuszy\u0144ski, PhD, used ultraviolet photons to create quantum reactions for up to five nanoseconds. This quantum coherence lasted thousands of times longer than researchers had expected in a microtubule. Similarly, at the University of Central Florida, researchers shined visible light into one end of microtubules and measured how long the microtubules took to emit that light. They observed re-emission of this light over hundreds of milliseconds to seconds\u2014more than enough time for the brain to perform all of its functions.\n\nThis observation provides concrete evidence that neurons are able to work at speeds that allow quantum operations. It brings us another step closer to understanding exactly how our brain\u2014and perhaps our very consciousness\u2014is linked to a quantum universe.\n\nThe mind \u201cas a quantum phenomenon\u201d would \u201cshape our thinking about a wide variety of related questions, such as whether coma patients or nonhuman animals are conscious,\u201d neuroscientist and Wellesley College professor Mike Wiest, PhD, says in a press release about his team\u2019s recent anesthesia study. In addition to the new work helping us understand more about how to treat brain-related health issues, he says \u201cwe will have entered a new era in our understanding of what we are.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The story so far: On December 13, Ajai Chowdhry, chairman of the Mission Governing Board of the nascent National Quantum Mission, said India plans to launch a quantum satellite in \u201c2-3 years for quantum communications\u201d.\n\nWhat is the National Quantum Mission?\n\nThe National Quantum Mission (NQM) is a Department of Science & Technology programme to accelerate the use of quantum physics in the development of next-generation communications and sensing systems.\n\nThe development of computers changed the course of human history from the mid-20th century onwards. Thanks to advances in this sector, which continue to this day, humankind has access to telecommunications, weather forecasts, drug-discovery programmes, search-and-rescue plans, artificial intelligence, etc.\n\nBut many of these advances are nearing a saturation point because the physics phenomena on which they are based, called classical physics, are hitting a performance upper-limit. Today scientists around the world are building new devices to perform the same functions but using quantum physics. Because the rules of quantum physics allow for the outcomes of classical physics as well as \u2018bonus\u2019 ones not found in the classical paradigm, the new devices are expected to have new abilities.\n\nThe Union Cabinet approved the NQM in April 2023 at a total cost of Rs 6,000 crore, to be implemented from 2023 to 2031. The planned quantum satellite is an experiment in this package.\n\nWhat is a quantum satellite?\n\nA quantum satellite is a term for a communications satellite that uses quantum physics to secure its signals.\n\nCommunications is a broad term that refers to technologies that send and receive signals. An important part of these technologies is security: preventing bad actors from intercepting a message being transmitted across large distances, through multiple networks.\n\nThe advent of quantum computers threatens the technologies currently being used to secure messages. Fortunately, quantum physics has also paved the way for new forms of protection, and quantum satellites are expected to facilitate them.\n\nHow are messages secured?\n\nSay two people, Anil and Selvi, are standing at two ends of a playground and wish to speak to each other. The simplest way is to shout or wave their hands. There is also a third person, Kaushik, standing in the middle of the ground trying to eavesdrop on the conversation. If Anil and Selvi are shouting or using hand signals, Kaushik will have little difficulty intercepting their messages \u2014 but not if they are communicating via WhatsApp.\n\nMessages in WhatsApp are encrypted. Encryption means a message is written in a secret code before it is transmitted. When the recipient receives it, they will use their knowledge of the code to decrypt the message and read it. If a bad actor like Kaushik somehow intercepts the message, he can\u2019t read it without knowing the code.\n\nFor example, in a Caesar cipher, the letters of the alphabet are offset by a fixed number. If the number is 5, the words BIRDS FLY AWAY become GNWIX KQD FBFD.\n\nThis paradigm is called cryptographic security. It gets its strength by hiding the key to cracking the code behind an extremely difficult mathematical problem. Anil\u2019s and Selvi\u2019s devices already have the solution to this problem. If Kaushik wants it, however, he has to first solve the problem with a computer \u2014 and the harder the problem, the more time (or more computing resources) he will need.\n\nA modern computer can crack a Caesar cipher quickly by repeatedly trying all possible keys (1-26) until the text becomes legible. But even the most powerful supercomputers can\u2019t crack the best Advanced Encryption Standard ciphers today in a single lifetime. Quantum computers may be able to do better, however.\n\nHow can quantum physics protect messages?\n\nQuantum cryptography uses the tenets of quantum physics to secure messages. Its most famous type is quantum key distribution (QKD).\n\nIn the example before, Anil used a secret code to encrypt or \u2018lock\u2019 his message and Selvi had the key to decrypt and read the message. QKD is concerned with sharing the key with Anil and Selvi such that if Kaushik is eavesdropping on the transmission, everyone will find out and the sharing is aborted.\n\nQuantum physics can reveal eavesdropping in different ways. One is quantum measurement \u2014 the act of measuring the properties of a quantum system, like a photon (the subatomic particle of light). According to the rules of quantum physics, a quantum measurement changes the state of the system. If information about the key is encoded in a stream of photons (in two states, one representing 0 and the other 1) and Kaushik traps and measures them to look for it, the state of the photons will change and Anil and Selvi will know the key has been compromised.\n\nAnother way is to use quantum entanglement: when two photons are entangled, any change to one particle will instantaneously change the other. (This is a necessarily simplistic description.)\n\nSince the key will be lost irrespective of what technological capabilities Kaushik possesses, QKD is said to provide unconditional security.\n\nHas QKD been implemented?\n\nRavindra Pratap Singh, of the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, wrote in 2023 that the standards for different QKD protocols and the technologies they will require to implement as designed are still a decade away. This said, China currently operates the world\u2019s largest QKD network with three quantum satellites and four ground stations.\n\nExperts are also trying to implement QKD across longer distances. In the two decades since its experimental proof in 1992, the distance of reliable transmissions has increased to several hundred kilometres either through fibre-optic cables or free space.\n\nIn 2013, researchers from China reported that they had implemented QKD between a ground station and a moving hot-air balloon (carrying a payload of instruments) 20 km up. This demonstration bolstered the case for quantum satellites.\n\nIn an October 2024 study, researchers at the Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, reported that the Indian Astronomical Observatory in Hanle, Ladakh, offered the best atmospheric conditions through which to transmit data for a satellite-based QKD system. It had an estimated signal loss of 44 dB, compared to 50 dB in the Chinese experiment.\n\n\u201cOur main signal would be at 810 nm while the uplink and downlink would use 532 nm and 1550 nm of wavelength, respectively,\u201d the paper\u2019s lead author Satya Ranjan Behera told the Department of Science & Technology. The planned beam distance is 500 km.\n\nDoes QKD have drawbacks?\n\nBecause QKD on paper can be very different from that in the real-world, the U.S. National Security Agency has recommended the use of post-quantum cryptography rather than quantum cryptography. Its criticism is focused on five limitations:\n\n(i) \u201cQKD does not provide a means to authenticate the QKD transmission source\u201d;\n\n(ii) \u201csince QKD is hardware-based\u201d, QKD networks can\u2019t be upgraded or patched easily;\n\n(iii) \u201cQKD increases infrastructure costs and insider threat risks\u201d that \u201celiminate many use cases from consideration\u201d;\n\n(iv) \u201cthe actual security provided by a QKD system is not the theoretical unconditional security from the laws of physics \u2026 but rather the more limited security that can be achieved by hardware and engineering designs\u201d; and\n\n(v) since eavesdroppers can cause a transmission to stop, they can deny the use of a transmission by its intended users (a.k.a. a denial-of-service attack).\n\nPost-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic techniques that resist attacks from both quantum and classical devices using more advanced classical encryption.\n\nQuantum physics also imposes some restrictions. For example, non-quantum information can be amplified before being transmitted across large distances whereas the no-cloning theorem prohibits the amplification of quantum information."

            "article_content": "By Cina LAWSON\n\nFor too long, African countries have been sidelined from the digital revolution due to limited technical capacity and inadequate infrastructure. Artificial intelligence promises to bridge the digital divide, but realizing its potential requires international support and significant investment in critical infrastructure.\n\nAs the world enters an era shaped by artificial intelligence, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are expected to capture just 10% of the economic growth generated by AI technologies. But by forming strategic partnerships and making large-scale infrastructure investments, LMICs can harness these technologies to foster inclusive, sustainable development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRapidly evolving AI systems have immense potential to revolutionize public-service delivery and alleviate poverty, unlocking economic opportunities for developing economies like Togo. But fully realizing the promise of these new tools requires adequate infrastructure, such as a reliable electricity supply and broadband connectivity. Without these foundations, the world\u2019s most advanced technologies will remain out of reach for communities that could benefit from them the most.\n\nOn November 13-15, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation organized an international AI conference in Lom\u00e9, bringing together government officials, researchers, civil-society leaders, international experts, and students to discuss the potential of emerging technologies to improve public services in the developing world. Togo is a prime example.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched Novissi, one of the world\u2019s first fully digital cash-transfer programs. Initially designed to support low-income urban residents, Novissi rapidly expanded to cover rural areas in Togo\u2019s 200 poorest cantons, enabling more than 920,000 informal-sector workers \u2013 roughly 25% of the country\u2019s adult population \u2013 to enroll.\n\nTop of Form\n\nBottom of Form\n\nBy combining machine learning with mobile-phone metadata, satellite imagery, and phone surveys, the Novissi program ultimately identified and supported more than 150,000 households, demonstrating how data-driven approaches can help governments deliver essential services quickly and equitably.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning. In recent years, we have leveraged data science and digital technologies to improve our emergency response capabilities and make government services more efficient, cost-effective, and responsive to citizens\u2019 needs.\n\nConsider the agriculture sector, which employs two-thirds of Togo\u2019s population and accounts for 40% of its GDP. Using satellite imagery and machine-learning tools like Mosaiks, Togolese policymakers can forecast crop yields, anticipate poor harvests, and craft targeted agricultural policies. But the real strength of these technologies is their versatility: a single investment enables policymakers to make evidence-based decisions on a wide range of issues, from electrification to deforestation.\n\nBy bolstering local ownership, African governments can drive inclusive growth. In Togo, we are working to build a sustainable ecosystem of local expertise through initiatives like the newly launched Togo Data Lab, a collaboration between the Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation and the Center for Effective Global Action at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe project joins other prominent African institutions working to position Africa at the forefront of digital development, such as the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences and the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data. In Togo, the Lab will assist the Togolese government in building sustainable data-science capabilities, thereby enabling us to use AI tools like large language models (LLMs) to accelerate progress toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Togolese data scientists trained at the Lab will then collaborate with international experts, thereby ensuring that solutions are driven by local talent.\n\nIn its first year, the Togo Data Lab will focus on agriculture, training staff to use Mosaiks to measure crop yields more precisely. But we have much higher ambitions. We see the Lab as a scalable platform capable of addressing major challenges in health, education, and climate policy.\n\nWe imagine a health-care system transformed by data science, with AI tools improving disease surveillance and enabling policymakers to predict outbreaks of preventable illnesses, and classrooms where LLM-assisted tutors handle administrative tasks, freeing teachers to do what they do best: teaching and connecting with students. We have made remarkable progress, but there is much more to be done.\n\nFor too long, African countries have been sidelined from the digital revolution due to limited technical capacity and inadequate infrastructure. That must change, and now is the time to change it. I urge the international community to join this vital effort. By engaging the private sector and making targeted investments, Africa could become a leader in the global digital economy, not just a participant.\n\nInvesting in local capacity not only empowers policymakers in developing countries like Togo to make smarter, data-driven decisions. It also lays the groundwork for a vast global network of problem solvers, ready to harness cutting-edge technologies to tackle the world\u2019s biggest challenges."
