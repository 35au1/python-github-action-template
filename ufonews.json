            "article_content": "The public has already been given the government\u2019s best answers to the latest panic over mysterious lights in the sky over New Jersey. Many Americans simply don\u2019t like a mundane answer \u2014 fixed-wing piloted aircraft, smaller planes, hobbyist drones \u2014 that implies they are rubes at best and paranoid at worst.\n\nEven assurances from New Jersey officials in particular have done little to quiet the current public clamor. Perhaps that\u2019s unsurprising for a state where, like so many other parts of the country, people were duped by Orson Welles\u2019 radio play \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d 86 years ago this fall. Perhaps that\u2019s a cheap shot at the Garden State on my part: A YouGov poll this year found that some 18 percent of Americans nationwide report having seen a UFO.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued a joint statement last week assuring the public that they \u201ctake seriously the threat that can be posed by unmanned aircraft systems.\u201d And this week the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned drones from flying over nearly two dozen communities in the state.\n\nIn some cases, people in New Jersey have been sending their own commercially available drones aloft to investigate reports of ... all the flying drones. I suspect what\u2019s going on in some of the cases is that people are seeing real drones aloft for the first time. Not only that: The government only recently allowed drones to be flown at night late last year. No doubt the public\u2019s unfamiliarity will decrease as these devices become more and more widespread and visible in all of our daily lives.\n\nBut the slew of photos and videos splashed across the internet in the past month claiming to document the presence of drones \u2014 friendly or otherwise \u2014 despite repeated insistence from the government and law enforcement that the lights are not malicious acts, dangerous objects or alien craft suggests something else is at work.\n\nUS officials have suggested that many of the objects might in fact be manned aircraft, such as airplanes or helicopters. Indeed, the tristate area is probably among the most congested air spaces in the country, crowded with large and light aircraft, satellites visible from earth and, yes, a fast-growing number of actual drones.\n\nThe lights in the sky are not North Korean or Iranian drones. Nor are nefarious drones being sent illegally en masse over secure military facilities \u2014 though the federal government did restrict airspace over one of Donald Trump\u2019s golf courses in New Jersey and a military facility nearby. In truth, many of the sightings are airplanes, helicopters, stars, satellites or just regular drones being flown for ordinary reasons. Larry Hogan, the former governor of Maryland, posted videos of suspicious lights in the sky above his house, only for a New York Post journalist to note that those lights looked just like the constellation Orion.\n\nThe zeal to get to the bottom of a lit-up night sky seems to know no bounds and suggests that on some level UFOs have left an indelible mark on the American psyche.\n\nEarlier this year, the Pentagon released an exhaustive and detailed report assessing all official government probes of reported UFO encounters since 1945 and found that \u201call investigative efforts, at all levels of classification, concluded that most sightings were ordinary objects and phenomena and the result of misidentification.\u201d The report did little to quell the belief that there was something nefarious afoot. Indeed, after the report was released, a poll found that 63 percent of the country still thinks that the US government knows more than it is telling the public about UFOs.\n\nWhile reports of alien abductions appear to be on the wane, a societal panic over drones suggests that they might be linked. Not only is the omnipresence of misinformation and disinformation spread online fueling the looming drone panic, the ability to alter or fabricate photos and videos will also make supposed evidence more convincing to your average, unwitting hokum consumer.\n\nThe reality in the skies today may be changing faster than at any period since Kitty Hawk. Drones are slowly becoming ubiquitous, with insufficient oversight or tracking. Operators of drones weighing more than half a pound are supposed to register the devices with the FAA, which counts over one million official registrations as of December. But that tally doesn\u2019t include the vast number of commercially available drones that come in under that limit. Another squadron could take flight for the first time after Christmas.\n\nI received my own drone about a year ago, a fun little toy that weighs less than the FAA limit and isn\u2019t much bigger than my shoe. It can fly for about a mile and a half about 500 yards above the ground and shoot 4K video. Since I\u2019ve been flying it, I\u2019ve also started to notice how omnipresent aerial footage has become in television productions and on the screens we live with. And why not? Examining events on the earth from the heavens has always captivated human imagination. Having the technology to do so is going to be wildly popular as the price of such craft plummets in the next few years.\n\nLeaving aside their current ubiquity in armed conflicts, the Drone Age is already upon us and the skies are going to get a lot more crowded. May it bring us more of the fascination without so much of the fear.\n\nThe New York Times"

            "article_content": "LLMs. Co-pilots. Agents. Two years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, the hype behind artificial Intelligence remains palpable. Major tech companies are pouring billions into sparkling new infrastructure for AI workloads. Utility companies in areas with dense data centers are seeing revenues and power consumption soar. Yet, outside of semiconductor and infrastructure players, few companies have seen significant revenue from AI products. Investors are increasingly left asking: When will these massive capital investments start benefiting software companies? What\u2019s causing the delay?\n\nWhere AI is showing up in our world today\n\nFirst, let\u2019s be clear: AI has been around in many industries for years, including financial services. Quantitative traders long ago embraced techniques that are now classified as \"AI\" including non-linear regressions and advanced optimization techniques. What excites us now are the rapid advancements in new areas like Generative AI, pattern recognition and deep learning. You\u2019ve likely noticed early use cases of GenAI like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot or Adobe\u2019s AI Assistant. These tools are being integrated into software platforms across industries with new use cases emerging at a rapid clip.\n\n\n\nAcross other industries, anecdotal datapoints of GenAI value creation are starting to stack up. Walmart recently shared that large language models helped them to \u201ccreate or improve more than 850 million pieces of data across its product catalog,\u201d completing the project with just 1% of the typical headcount. Amazon\u2019s CEO Andy Jassy shared a similar datapoint when he disclosed that the use of Amazon\u2019s GenAI assistant saved 7,500 \u201cdeveloper-years\u201d of programming time in a recent major software update.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most salient example of AI generating value is hiding under our collective noses in social media, where algorithmic matching on posts like Instagram and TikTok optimizes the content and ads we see. This area has seen tremendous gains in recent years and has helped leading AI adopters in social media improve ad returns and gain market share.\n\n\n\nAt our firm, we\u2019ve adopted AI with care, led initially by eager adoption of various AI copilots and coding assistants. We have also explored alpha-generating use cases like pattern recognition and sentiment analysis. Looking further out, we are excited about developing custom assistants to superpower our investment and client teams. We believe this is just the tip of the iceberg. Much more is yet to come.\n\nThe delay in benefits of AI for software investors\n\n\n\nSo, if AI is being leveraged across industries, why hasn\u2019t the software sector seen the uptick in growth that investors expected? New revenue streams for software firms haven\u2019t met the hype, leading to stark underperformance for the software industry with a few notable exceptions. We believe this partly reflects Amara\u2019s law: We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. The rapid adoption of ChatGPT, and the sense of magic many of us experienced when first using it, may have exacerbated elevated expectations.\n\n\n\nThe reality is that product development and adoption take time. AI development and testing alone can take months, if not years, before a project is ready for deployment. This timeline is further elongated by data governance challenges. As anyone who has worked at a massive conglomerate can likely attest, many large firms have poorly structured and poorly governed data policies, rife with operational silos and inconsistent rules. This complicates development. Compliance and cybersecurity can further stretch timelines. While many firms are seeing real and tangible benefits from AI, getting these projects into production is taking longer than anticipated, creating a mismatch between investor expectations and reality.\n\n\n\nWhile this delay has certainly led to disappointment among software investors, it has not been the only issue. The rapid pace of breakthrough innovation in AI has also sucked the proverbial oxygen out of the room for other technology projects. Some companies have paused major technology initiatives, hesitating to commit to multi\\year contracts while still developing their AI strategy. All of this has elongated sales cycles and created a temporary slowdown in software demand.\n\nA window of opportunity for longer-term investors\n\nSurveys have shown that corporations are seeing real, tangible value creation from AI, especially in cost reduction. But AI isn\u2019t just about optimizing existing business models \u2014 it\u2019s driving innovation in areas like autonomous cars, healthcare, clean energy, and even entertainment and media. These advancements have the potential to reshape industries and open up new markets. For long-term investors, this makes AI more than a short-term play \u2014 it\u2019s a foundation for future growth. Again, like many transformative technologies, AI\u2019s impact may have been overestimated in the short term, but its long-term potential will likely have been underestimated.\n\n\n\nWe believe the current market anxiety in software creates an opportunity for long-term investors. The project delays are largely temporary in nature and should be resolved as firms update their technological road map and set AI priorities. Recently, we\u2019ve noticed renewed enthusiasm in the software demand environment. As demand normalizes, we expect industry growth to re-accelerate, which should remove the wet blanket from valuations.\n\nBottom line\n\n\n\nA Gartner survey earlier this year found that 90% of CFOs expected increased AI budgets in 2024, with none planning cuts. Yet, it has been clear that many projects have faced delays due to complexity, data governance issues, security concerns, and a scarcity of talent. This has created an air pocket in an industry that is usually known more for \"eating the world\" than for booms and busts. Just as the internet didn\u2019t take off overnight, AI still has some development before it starts to deliver significant results for investors. We believe those returns are coming, and the impact is on the horizon if investors can remain patient. Now is the time for investors to position themselves for the shift from hype to impact. As AI projects move from development to deployment, those who stay the course or increase their exposure to the right opportunities are likely to see meaningful returns ahead.\n\nDave Smith is head of technology investing at Bailard.

            "article_content": "I\u2019ve spent the past year covering every major phone launch in the US, and each one loudly declared the same thing: AI is here, and ours is the AI phone you\u2019ve been waiting for. Each was followed by much applause and favorable stock price movement. But when I got those phones into my hands, the AI was underwhelming, to say the least.\n\nThe theory is that smartphones as we know them are evolving into something new: AI smartphones. An AI smartphone will be a new kind of device that doesn\u2019t force you to interact with a grid of apps all day long; you\u2019ll be able to ask it to order pizza or send an email just by using an AI-imbued voice assistant. You\u2019ll be able to point your camera at a flyer for a show, have the AI check whether you\u2019re free, and add it to your calendar. You\u2019ll ask it about something a friend said to you \u2014 maybe in an email or a text, you\u2019re not sure which \u2014 and it will go find the information for you.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini assistant has steadily improved since launch but still falls short of a true AI assistant.\n\nPersonally, all of the above sounds great to me. I\u2019d love some help with the chores I carry out a hundred times a day on my phone \u2014 and with the firehose of incoming information and notifications I deal with. But AI smartphones are not here yet, not by a long shot, despite what you may have heard. Instead, what we have feels like a collection of loosely associated tech demos.\n\nThe (supposedly) AI smartphones of 2024\n\nAll of the major phone makers are at fault. Samsung opened the year with its Galaxy S24 launch in January, declaring \u201cGalaxy AI is here\u201d at a hockey arena-appropriate volume. To be sure, the devices it announced are good smartphones, and they run a blend of Samsung and Google\u2019s Gemini Nano models on-device, but I wouldn\u2019t call them AI smartphones.\n\nSupposedly, they can help you take distractions out of your photos \u2014 but you might end up with something even more distracting instead. The live language interpreter feature for phone calls could come in handy for something like making a dinner reservation. But it also translated a statement from my colleague as \u201cI am eating my chair.\u201d (She was not.) Most users will find that these AI features fade into the background once the novelty wears off.\n\nSometimes AI gets it right \u2014 it correctly identifies an artificial plant here.\n\nLater in 2024, fall hardware season arrived early with AI-ified Pixels. Google has made much of AI on its phones for the past couple of years, but the company\u2019s Gemini AI is absolutely everywhere on the Pixel 9 series. There\u2019s an AI-generated summary at the top of the weather app, a new app that saves and tags your screenshots using AI, a new AI-powered default assistant, and lots of AI image generation tools \u2014 from silly to seriously worrying.\n\nSome of it does feel useful, particularly the screenshots app, which is the kind of thing you might find handy if you tend to keep infinite Chrome tabs open on your phone as bookmarks. But these features, siloed into their respective apps, don\u2019t feel like they have much to do with each other. Gemini sort of connects the dots with extensions, but support for different apps is being added slowly \u2014 and even with an extension, Gemini can only do so much for you.\n\nApple Intelligence started shipping a month after the iPhone 16, but its blockbuster features won\u2019t arrive until 2025.\n\nLast but not least, we met the iPhones \u201cbuilt for Apple Intelligence\u201d in September. I think it says a lot about the state of Apple\u2019s AI that the iPhone 16 initially shipped without Apple Intelligence. AI features finally arrived in late October with iOS 18.1. And if anyone was waiting with bated breath, this first update was probably underwhelming.\n\nRight now, Apple Intelligence includes summaries for notifications and emails, tools to alter the style of your writing, and a new glowing UI for Siri. Notification summaries can be useful, but usually they\u2019re just funny. The writing tools are standard fare at this point, and Siri is basically the same old assistant with a new coat of paint. There\u2019s more to come, but what\u2019s here now certainly doesn\u2019t add up to an AI smartphone.\n\nA messy year for AI\n\nIt\u2019s not just phones; this is a messy moment for AI in general. Depending on who you ask, AI is either a massive bubble that\u2019s about to burst or a few months away from evolving into digital God. AI is being foisted on us in every direction: surfacing in Google search results, lurking in every Meta product, greeting you by name in the Spotify app. It\u2019s hard to separate the signal from the noise when it comes to AI, because the noise is everywhere and it\u2019s so goddamn loud!\n\nAnd there really might be a signal in there \u2014 especially when it comes to our phones. Siri really might become more useful, with an Apple Intelligence update this spring that will allow it to take action in apps through something known as App Intents. Developers will be able to surface certain actions \u2014 like ordering the pizza that AI proponents keep promising \u2014 so they\u2019re accessible at the system level by Siri. Google seems to be preparing a similar framework in Android 16, which could help bridge the gap between Gemini and individual apps without the apps needing an entire extension. And who knows? Maybe Bixby will get in the game, too.\n\nThe trouble is, after a full year of supposedly game-changing AI on our mobile devices that amounted to nothing, it\u2019s starting to sound like the phone makers are crying wolf. The real AI smartphones need to stand up pretty soon \u2014 before our collective patience starts to run out."

However, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Garrett Simons a new property they were moved to has caused her to be fearful for her children due to \"paranormal activity\".\n\nThe mum told proceedings how since they moved in \u201cnumerous objects\u201d in the new house have been \u201cflown from side to side\u201d, while doors and a table and chairs \u201cwere moving in front of our eyes\u201d. She claims while making food for her children, objects flew out of the cupboard she opened.\n\nMs Stokes said she contacted the previous occupant of the house, who wrote them a letter the applicant described as \u201cbeyond traumatic\u201d. She claimed she brought the letter to the attention of the council but was \u201claughed at\u201d in a meeting. She said: \u201cEveryone deserves a home. I never asked for a mansion, I asked for a safe home for my kids.\n\n\u201cI just want somewhere safe for my kids five days before Christmas,\u201d the Irish Mirror reported.\n\nThe High Court heard how the mould in the first property was so bad the entire family had to sleep downstairs instead of their bedrooms. They also had to make several hospital visits. The couple claim in the five years they lived in the property, the problem with mould became so bad that they were forced to leave and live temporarily with relatives before returning to the house.\n\nThe court heard the council placed the family on a transfer list and the offer of a new property was accepted by the Stokes in October. At the High Court Mr Justice Simons struck out the Stokes\u2019 claim against Leitrim County Council.\n\nMr Justice Simons said the claim before him only related to the first property and that if there were new claims, they would have to be lodged separately with the court. Mr Justice Simons said the only case before him was in relation to the first house and \u201cthe case has come and gone, as it were\u201d due to the Stokes' transferring to the new house.\n\nHe told Ms Stokes he understood her concern about the second house experiencing \"paranormal activity\" and her fears for the safety of her children but a third house would mean a new application to the local authority."

            "article_content": "Dead Boy Detectives, a fantasy series following two dead best friends who evade the afterlife in order to help spirits trapped amongst the living, hit Netflix earlier this year - and while the show received widespread critical acclaim and holds a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes...there's a good chance you didn't see it.\n\nThe series, based on the comic book of the same name, was first announced as a new streaming show for Max - which was then, and still is, the streaming home for DC shows. The show was subsequently moved to Netflix after the streamer acquired the live-action adaptation of The Sandman - which made perfect sense, given that Dead Boy Detectives is technically a spin-off from The Sandman comics and is set in the same world. I was immediately nervous, however, as Netflix is known for quickly canceling fantasy shows - no matter how highly rated or how popular in views - and I had a sneaking feeling that the show wouldn't last very long.\n\nI was right - and I'm still sad about it. Dead Boy Detectives follows Edwin Payne (George Rexstrew), the brains, and Charles Rowland (Jayden Revri), the brawn. Both were killed in different time periods - albeit in equally tragic ways - but found each other in death, and became best friends. Rather than go back to their eternal resting places, the pair decide to use their time on earth for good and open a detective agency for otherworldly matters. It's here in the land of the living that they make two human friends, Crystal Palace (Kassius Nelson) and Niko (Yuyu Kitamura) - though it\u2019s not without helping through their own paranormal situations.\n\nBut it's so much more than just a cutesy teen series with a gothic flare. Dead Boy Detectives isn't afraid to delve into serious, traumatic situations - from child abuse to familicide, from revenge porn to surviving narcissistic abuse - and it does so in a way that teaches not only the characters (some of who admittedly can't quite seem to wrap their heads around it at first), but the viewers at home who might not have any experience with or prior knowledge of these types of situations.\n\nIt might seem silly the idea of Crystal fighting off her ex-boyfriend who is quite literally a demon, but the show uses the metaphor of demonic possession to explain how victims of narcissistic abuse are used and manipulated. Charles's residual anger as a result of his father's abuse - and Crystal's frustration and inability to understand - is also handled so thoughtfully, and with such care. Another episode even touches on suicide, and humanizes the individuals who take their own lives by cleverly explaining the euphoria someone experiences after they've made the decision (which is something I've never ever seen touched on in a TV show).\n\n(Image credit: Netflix)\n\nSometimes, another streamer comes in and saves a canceled show - but that this is unlikely for Dead Boys (at least for the foreseeable future) given that Netflix has more or less become the official home to the Sandman universe, but I do think that Steve Yockey, Schwartz, and the writing team created something that can absolutely stand on its own without Sandman cameos or any sort of affiliation. Yes, the show has a cameo or two from The Sandman series, but they could've easily been removed (and were likely only added to draw in the existing Sandman audience).\n\nBut whether the show gets its miracle renewal or not, I invite you, dear reader, to watch all eight episodes - each just under an hour in length - while they\u2019re still available to stream on Netflix. If you\u2019re not swayed by the brilliant ways that the series tackles difficult topics, you might fall in love with the whimsical, Tim Burton-esque opening theme, the absolutely ridiculous and colorful villains (one of which is the literal king of all the cats in the land), the delightfully queer nature of the show and the way it doesn\u2019t shy away from LGBTQ+ characters or their unions, or you may just like the format of a good ol\u2019 procedural.\n\nSign up for the Total Film Newsletter Bringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nEither way, there\u2019s truly something for everyone - and you can\u2019t say that about too many shows, or too many supernatural teen dramas even. I worry that Dead Boy Detectives will quickly become another forgotten streaming gem, but it deserves so much more - and I hope you fall in love with it, too.\n\nFor more, check out our Dead Boy Detectives review and our roundup of the best shows of 2024, on which it features."

            "article_content": "Right whales are among the rarest whales on Earth, and their populations are highly endangered. Now, scientists say some of the gentle giants may live nearly twice as long as previously thought. The new findings, published December 20 in the journal Science Advances, make southern right whales the mammal with the second-longest known life span, behind only the bowhead whale. The findings\u2014and the novel methods used to achieve them\u2014could help inform conservation efforts moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking about these whales all wrong,\u201d says study co-author Peter Corkeron, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia, to the Guardian\u2019s Petra Stock. \u201cIt\u2019s impeded our ability to get it right when it comes to doing the science for conservation to stop these whales from going extinct.\u201d\n\nEstimating the age of some individual whales is relatively easy. For example, a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) killed in 2007 had a harpoon tip stuck in its blubber that was manufactured in the late 1800s, allowing researchers to surmise it was at least 115 years old.\n\nBut deducing the average life expectancy of an entire species can be more challenging. For one, past methods\u2014such as analyzing their earwax, which builds up each year like the rings of a tree\u2014have required whales to be dead. In addition, commercial whaling was so intense throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that most of the largest, oldest animals were likely missing from researchers\u2019 calculations. Most of today\u2019s longevity estimates are probably skewed by an overrepresentation of younger whales, the team writes in the paper.\n\nSo, for the new study, researchers deployed some new tactics. Using photos of right whales dating back to the 1970s, they identified individual females based on their appearance and noted when they stopped showing up in photos, presumably because they died. Then, they incorporated this information into statistical models that are similar to those used by life insurance companies to estimate human life expectancy.\n\nThese novel methods are \u201cquite impressive,\u201d as C. Scott Baker, an ecologist at Oregon State University who was not involved with the paper, tells Science\u2019s Mitch Leslie. \u201cThey make a good case for the plausibility of their results.\u201d\n\nThe findings suggest southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) have a median lifespan of about 73 years. But up to 10 percent might live to be 131 years old\u2014and a handful may even approach 150. That\u2019s much higher than previous estimates, which suggested the marine mammals had a maximum life expectancy between 70 and 80 years.\n\nResearchers used the same techniques for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), a critically endangered species with an estimated 372 individuals remaining. The study finds that North Atlantic right whales have a median lifespan of just 22 years, with the longest-living 10 percent surpassing the age of 47.\n\nOverall, the findings reinforce the idea that these animals are still bouncing back from the damage wrought by commercial whaling, a practice that ended less than four decades ago.\n\n\u201cTo attain healthy populations that include old animals, recovery might take hundreds of years,\u201d says study lead author Greg Breed, an ecologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, in a statement. \u201cFor animals that live to be 100 or 150 and only give birth to a surviving calf every 10 years or so, slow recovery is to be expected.\u201d\n\nWhy such a big life expectancy gap between southern and North Atlantic right whales? Scientists suspect North Atlantic right whales are much more vulnerable because of where they live. They primarily inhabit Atlantic coastal waters near Canada and the United States\u2014a bustling region with lots of commercial activity.\n\nThis month alone, three North Atlantic right whales were seen tangled in fishing gear off the East Coast of the U.S. They\u2019re also susceptible to boat strikes and climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a maze of rope these animals need to get through, and there\u2019s huge ports coming into the U.S., there\u2019s lots of shipping,\u201d Corkeron tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s Sam Bradbrook and Samantha Goerling.\n\nThe Southern Ocean, meanwhile, is not nearly as congested. One takeaway from the study is that \u201cit\u2019s important to keep it that way,\u201d Corkeron adds.\n\nMoving forward, researchers say their methods could be applied to other species, such as blue, fin, sei, humpback, gray and sperm whales. And, in the meantime, their recent findings could lead to the development of more effective conservation plans.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how long wild animals live has major implications for how to best protect them,\u201d Corkeron and Breed write in the Conversation. \u201cAnimals that have very long lifespans usually reproduce extremely slowly and can go many years between births. \u2026 Conservation and management strategies that do not plan accordingly will have a higher chance of failure. This is especially important given the expected impacts of climate disruption.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Microsoft and OpenAI have had something of a symbiotic relationship, with the former giving billions of capital to a startup AI lab and in return gaining early access to cutting-edge models that are now baked into Microsoft\u2019s suite of productivity software. The two companies have been headed in diverging directions, however, and Reuters reported today that Microsoft is looking to add more models to its 365 Copilot product that aren\u2019t built by OpenAI.\n\nThe reasoning, according to the report, is that Microsoft sees OpenAI\u2019s cutting-edge GPT-4 model as too expensive and not fast enough to satisfy its enterprise customers. Copilot 365 is an AI-powered assistant built into Microsoft\u2019s suite of productivity applications including Word and PowerPoint. The tool is supposed to ingest all of a company\u2019s data and do a myriad of things, like give users the ability to quickly find information without needing to hunt through disparate apps; quickly generate a list of the company\u2019s most profitable business units; or instantaneously summarize meetings and emails.\n\nIt is supposed to do those things, but customers and insiders alike are still underwhelmed by Copilot 365, which costs an extra $30 per month per user on a team. In a recent Business Insider story, employees of Microsoft speaking anonymously called the tools \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cgimmicky,\u201d not working well 75% of the time. On the customer front, Business Insider cited a survey of 123 IT leaders published by management consultancy Gartner, which found only four said Copilot provided significant value to their companies. It should be noted some other stories have reported on companies that have found value in using large language models, such as by simplifying customer support.\n\nSome customers who spoke to Business Insider specifically noted that 365 Copilot is too expensive.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT is a frontier, general model, meaning it is trained on vast swaths of data and can be more expensive and slow to run; that is why most models are offered in \u201clite\u201d versions that perform less intensive inference or \u201cthinking.\u201d Microsoft has been training its own in-house, smaller models like one called Phi-4, and Reuters reports that sources speaking to the outlet said the company is looking to \u201ccustomize other open-weight models to make 365 Copilot faster and more efficient.\u201d\n\nIn one sense, it makes sense that Microsoft would want to reduce its reliance on OpenAI. If the company is right and AI is going to be the next generational change in computing, relying on an independent company for the core technology is not a great idea.\n\nMicrosoft has plowed billions of dollars into OpenAI and will receive 75% of its profits until it makes it breaks even on its investment, and even then will still hold a large stake in the startup. The company in effect gets to hedge its bets\u2014build its own in-house models while keeping a lottery ticket in OpenAI in case it continues on its current skyward trajectory.\n\nDespite being the front-runner today, some skeptics of OpenAI say that we may not know a true winner in the AI race yet (should these technologies be as revolutionary as we are told to believe). In the same way that there were numerous search engines that came online in the \u201990s, only to be quickly trounced when the latecomer Google showed up. Microsoft is likely wise to hedge."

            "article_content": "Nestle Vietnam has set its sights to capitalise on rising demand for convenient beverage options in the country to drive the growth of its Nescafe a ready-to-serve liquid concentrate.\n\nAccording to the firm, Nescafe stepped up its format and product innovation to keep up with the latest trends and consumer demands.\n\n\u201cVietnam, in particular, is a country with a very rich coffee culture, and there have also been some novel popular trends emerging over the past few years,\u201d Nestle Vietnam Business Executive Officer Mostafa Youssef told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\n\u201cCold coffee tends to be more popular here, and interestingly there has also been a movement towards liquid coffees \u2013 which is why we have recently launched a new innovation in the form of a coffee concentrate in a stick.\n\n\u201cThe convenience factor is strong with these as all consumers need to do is open up the coffee stick, pour over ice \u2013 and that\u2019s all done, they can enjoy a very quick cup of coffee with no need to source hot water to dissolve powder or dilute the coffee unless they want to.\u201d\n\nFoodNavigator-Asia has asked experts in India to weigh in with recommendations for India\u2019s spice sector bounce back from two high profile contamination scandals this year.\n\nCarcinogenic ethylene oxide is a pesticide that was found in spice powders from major Indian brands Everest and MDH, putting the country\u2019s spice industry under intense scrutiny.\n\nThis has led to bans in Hong Kong and the Maldives, product recalls in Singapore, and stricter checks on India\u2019s spices in Australia and the US.\n\nDespite the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) emphasising its stringent regulations, overseas bans and domestic concerns raised questions about the effectiveness of these measures.\n\nFollowing the Hong Kong ban on 5 April, FSSAI issued a statement on 8 April that raised the maximum residue limits (MRL) of pesticides by 10 times from 0.01mg/kg to 0.1mg/kg.\n\nAlthough FSSAI clarified that these only applies to pesticides not registered with the Indian authorities, and that the international Codex standards were adhered to, it sparked criticism and confusion.\n\n\u201cIt does seem counterintuitive for the FSSAI to increase the MRL for pesticides not registered with authorities, especially considering the potential health implications,\u201d Equinox Labs CEO Ashwin Bhadri said.\n\n\u201cThe implications of such a decision could be significant, as it may lead to increased pesticide residues in food products, potentially impacting consumer health in the long term.\n\n\u201cIt may also raise doubts about the effectiveness of regulatory measures in ensuring food safety and quality.\u201d\n\nThe Indonesian government has revised food packaging regulations in response to consumer and academic concerns over the presence of dangerous chemicals entering the food supply chain.\n\nAs of 2023, Indonesia had no specific regulations in place regarding certain harmful chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), more commonly known as the \u2018Forever Chemicals\u2019 due to their slow degradation rate.\n\nA great deal of scientific evidence already linked PFAS exposure to an array of health issues from cancer, cardiovascular disease, infertility, elevated blood pressure and more.\n\n\u201cIndonesia currently has no regulations on PFAS in food packaging [but] the troubling findings from our study indicate that we need stronger regulations to protect our children and families from exposures to toxic PFAS chemicals especially in daily products,\u201d Nexus3 Senior Advisor Yuyun Ismawati said whilst announcing the study findings.\n\n\u201cPFAS can also be released when people wear clothing, during washing, and when used synthetic textile wastes are disposed \u2013 [this] can contaminate waterways, leading to PFAS exposures from contaminated drinking water or food.\u201d\n\nFoodNavigator-Asia took a closer look at five of the top trends affecting the Asia Pacific food and beverage industry in 2024.\n\nThese included the \u2018premium affordability\u2019 trend surfaced by many food firms, as well as the evolution of plant-based protein to moving away from mimicry in innovation.\n\nOther significant trends included the rise of ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages driven by convenience and relatability, the continuous rise of low-to-no alcohol, and major factors behind the growth of the snacking industry.\n\nThe European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) has faced major pushback from ministers and trade organisations within Europe, as well as alongside continued pressure from palm oil producer nations in Asia this year.\n\nOn March 28 2024, an industry-wide cross-commodity letter was addressed to EC President of the Council for Environment and Minister for the Climate, the Environment, Sustainable Development and the Green Deal of Belgium Zakia Khattabi, calling for \u2018urgent clarifications and workable solutions\u2019 on EUDR implementation.\n\nThis was signed by a coalition of more than 20 European industry organisations spanning many areas of trade, including representatives on food trade in cereals, oils, rice, livestock, meat and more \u2013 all highlighting concerns over the supposed enforcement in December 2024.\n\n\u201cConsidering the significant adjustments that are needed from suppliers, operators and traders, we would like to express serious concerns regarding the pace of preparation of EUDR-related legislative acts, the mandatory systems and the guidance and clarifications required for implementation,\u201d the coalition said in the letter, which FoodNavigator-Asia has viewed.\n\n\u201cOperators and traders are working hard to prepare their supply chains and adapt their systems and due diligence processes for compliance with the EUDR [and] try to develop workable solutions compatible with the EUDR provisions.\n\n\u201cHowever, these efforts are impeded by large gaps in information, lack of appropriate technical solutions and by misconceptions as to the functioning of our complex chains.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean government has planned to mandate label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, replacing this with a digital QR code system over the next two years.\n\nSouth Korea committed to a range of sustainability goals, including the slashing of plastic waste production by 50% and the doubling of recycling rates in the country from 34% to 70%, both by 2030.\n\nThis year\u2019s developments saw the ministry calling for public comment on an initiative to mandate the use of label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, to be implemented after a two-year transition period.\n\n\u201cIn order to reduce the amount of label waste in the country from drinking water bottles and improve the efficiency of recycling systems locally, we will introduce a new label-free QR code system for all such bottles,\u201d MoE said via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cFrom January 1 2026, all individual types of drinking water bottles such as mineral waters that are manufactured in Korea will be subject to this change.\n\n\u201cAs the label-free QR code display method is mandated for target audiences, we aim to start with a smooth trial operation and early conversion [in order to] reflect any industry difficulties regarding displaying any necessary sales information via the QR code, as well as to determine the scope for product promotion and advertising.\u201d\n\nGlobal food corporation Cargill has leveraged its cocoa-sourcing networks in Asia and other business units to support customers in overcoming the cocoa supply shortage, and ensure consumers continue to have access to chocolate products.\n\nAccording to the International Cocoa Organization, global cocoa supply is projected to decline by nearly 11% to 4.449m tonnes in the 2023-2024 season, compared with 2022-23.\n\nThis is primarily caused by \u201ccatastrophic harvests\u201d in Ghana and Ivory Coast, which are responsible for over 60% of the world\u2019s cocoa supply.\n\nIn the face of this crisis, Cargill has drawn on its extensive cocoa sourcing networks and innovation expertise to help customers address current challenges, and ensure consumers still get to enjoy chocolate products.\n\n\u201cCocoa supply is indeed a pressing issue for the industry. Cargill is a bean-to-bar solutions provider, which means that we have the capabilities to innovate along every step of the value chain, from sourcing of raw materials to product customisation and solutions provision. For example, we are able to provide Asian-sourced cocoa products as we source globally.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are actively reaching out to our customers to see if they need support in managing this situation, such as sourcing, alternative recipes and product trials. We are able to tailor-make cocoa powder for a certain flavour and colour, and combine different ingredients to create new solutions or replacements,\u201d Xiaoling Liu, Indulgence Leader, Food Solutions Asia Pacific at Cargill, told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nThe EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) has faced pressure from within its own Parliament to postpone implementation as an \u2018urgent\u2019 matter this year, with concerns over key trade commodities such as palm oil and cocoa.\n\nThe EUDR received much criticism particularly from palm oil industry experts and countries producing key commodities likely to be affected such as palm oil, cocoa and coffee, and came under fire from within the EU parliament as well.\n\nThis dissent was led by European Peoples\u2019 Party (EPP) environmental spokesperson Peter Liese, who pushed for an \u2018urgent\u2019 postponement and \u2018far less bureaucratic\u2019 implementation of the EUDR.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the EUDR is correct, but its implementation is far too bureaucratic [and] the European Commission absolutely must postpone the entry into force of the deforestation regulation, then use the transitional period to reduce bureaucracy in the text,\u201d he said via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cWe must do something about deforestation worldwide and take our responsibility seriously, [however] the regulation has been turned into a bureaucratic monster - Many small farmers around the world and even small forest owners in the European Union cannot work with the text.\n\n\u201cThe preparatory work that the Commission should have carried out has not been done [and many] countries are complaining massively about the legislation, including countries that are pursuing the same goal as we are, namely to stop deforestation.\n\nAs of time of writing, the EUDR implementation has been postponed to the end of 2025.\n\nResearchers in India have highlighted that the misuse of antibiotics in food animal production in Asia could pose a serious danger to public health in the region.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a significant global threat, causing substantial economic losses and an estimated annual loss of 700,000 lives.\n\nResearchers at the Veterinary and Animal Sciences University in Punjab noted the alarming rise of antibiotic resistance and its potential transmission to humans through the food chain.\n\nThey also shed light on the pervasive use of critically important antibiotics in food animal production across Asia as well as how limited surveillance and regulatory controls had amplified concerns over antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe study encompassed 11 WHO member countries \u2014 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste.\n\nResults from the review of 108 selected publications revealed a staggering 1,126 scientific publications on antibiotic use in food animals, wherein the study identified a concerning trend of antibiotic misuse in livestock, poultry and aquaculture.\n\nChina\u2019s removal of tariffs on all dairy products from New Zealand has been posited to spell huge potential for brands with a strong focus on quality and sustainability.\n\nChina and New Zealand signed a free trade agreement (FTA) in 2008, but with regard to dairy it took 16 years to finally see all tariffs removed.\n\nAccording to New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade data, New Zealand was the first developed country in the world to enter into an FTA with China.\n\nVarious New Zealand dairy products have seen export tariff decreases over the years, but although many of these hit zero in 2019, duties were still in place for liquid milk, butter and cheese until 2021; and for milk powder until Dec 31 2023.\n\nAs of Jan 1 this year, all tariffs were officially declared to have been removed by the Chinese Embassy in New Zealand via a formal statement, which was warmly welcomed by New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay.\n\n\u201cAll safeguard duties on milk powder [entering China] have been removed as of January 1 2024, which marks the final liberalisation of dairy access under the [China-New Zealand] FTA,\u201d McClay announced via a separate statement."

According to a recent Gartner report, 70% of companies that successfully apply observability will gain a competitive edge through faster problem identification and enhanced decision-making.\n\nHowever, as application development has progressed from monolith stacks to microservices, and user expectations have shifted toward instant digital experiences, companies have accumulated a mix of observability tools, each tailored to different parts of their tech stack. This hodgepodge raises costs, complicates data analysis, and slows issue resolution.\n\nThe Kloudfuse observability platform addresses these challenges by building on three foundational principles: unification, cost optimization, and intelligent automation. Here\u2019s a closer look at the observability landscape, the unique challenges organizations face today, and how Kloudfuse is designed to provide a unified, affordable, and intelligent approach to modern observability."

            "article_content": "The recent market shifts reveal contrasting trends \u2014 Solana price forecast suggests further dips, as the coin drops from $263.83 to $185, with predictions pointing to a bearish trend. Meanwhile, Binance coin (BNB) security remains a focal point for investors, emphasizing advanced protection mechanisms amidst increasing scrutiny.\n\nOn the other side, BlockDAG (BDAG) offers a compelling edge with its recent dashboard upgrade that comes with a limited-time 5-tier bonus system. Starting with an impressive 150% bonus on the first purchase, the rewards grow even bigger as buyers proceed. This utility-focused project has also exceeded expectations by raising over $171 million in its presale, firmly establishing itself as one of the crypto coins to watch right now.\n\nSolana Price Forecast: Will It Recover After 18% Drop to $185?\n\nSolana recently achieved an all-time high of $263.83 but quickly dropped by 16%, trading at $224.92. Market predictions suggest further declines, with a low of $215 anticipated this week. It has struggled to maintain its upward momentum, raising concerns among its community.\n\nDespite its large market cap of $107.94 billion, short-term forecasts paint a bearish picture, and recovery to its peak may take time. While optimism persists among long-term supporters, the Solana price forecast reflects ongoing challenges that cast uncertainty over its immediate performance.\n\nExamining Binance Coin (BNB) Security Features\n\nBinance Coin (BNB) is widely recognized for its robust security features, including advanced encryption and Proof of Stake mechanisms. Binance coin (BNB) security is further reinforced by two-factor authentication (2FA), offering an additional layer of user protection.\n\nHowever, concerns about regulatory scrutiny and centralized dependencies weigh heavily on BNB. Recent legal challenges, including investigations by major authorities, have heightened uncertainty about its long-term prospects. Moreover, analysts argue that its reliance on the Binance ecosystem raises questions about decentralization.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s 5-Tier Gamified Bonuses to End on January 8!\n\nCrypto enthusiasts often seek opportunities where their investments yield more than expected, and BlockDAG\u2019s latest dashboard upgrade delivers exactly that. By introducing an innovative 5-tier bonus system, BlockDAG has created a unique reward structure that turns every purchase into a step toward greater returns, redefining the way buyers engage with their holdings.\n\nUsing the BDAG250 code, buyers can start with a 150% bonus on their first purchase, followed by an even bigger 170% bonus on the second. But the excitement doesn\u2019t stop there\u2014\u201dmystery boxes\u201d reveal hidden bonuses as users make additional purchases. Each step unlocks higher rewards, making the process both thrilling and highly rewarding.\n\nThis gamified bonus structure has quickly become one of the most talked-about features in the crypto market, giving participants a unique incentive to grow their portfolios. But here\u2019s the catch: the bonus offer is set to end on January 8, making now the perfect time to take advantage of these incredible rewards.\n\nMoreover, BlockDAG\u2019s presale success underscores its growing dominance in the market, with over $168.5 million raised by selling more than 17.4 billion BDAG coins. Early BDAG holders have already seen their stakes multiply, as the price has surged 2,240% from its starting point of $0.001 to $0.0234 in batch 26.\n\nFor those looking to become a part of this rising crypto star, now could be the ideal time, as the BDAG coins are still available at affordable prices of a mere $0.0234. Yet, this low-entry price won\u2019t be around for long, as the current batch is nearing its close, setting the stage for a significant price increase in the next batch.\n\nCrypto Coins to Watch Now in the Market\n\nWhile Solana price forecast suggests further dips to $215 and Binance coin (BNB) security faces regulatory scrutiny, BlockDAG is charting a different course. With its innovative 5-tier bonus system and the use of the BDAG250 code, BlockDAG offers up to 170% bonuses, transforming user engagement and rewards.\n\nThe project has already raised $168.5 million in its presale, with prices surging 2,240% in just a couple of months. As the current batch nears completion, prices are set to rise in the next round. For those seeking crypto coins to watch now for massive gains, BlockDAG\u2019s record-breaking momentum and unique incentives make it a standout choice.\n\nPresale: https://purchase.blockdag.network\n\nWebsite: https://blockdag.network\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/blockDAGnetworkOfficial\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Q7BxghMVyu"

            "article_content": "Right whales are among the rarest whales on Earth, and their populations are highly endangered. Now, scientists say some of the gentle giants may live nearly twice as long as previously thought. The new findings, published December 20 in the journal Science Advances, make southern right whales the mammal with the second-longest known life span, behind only the bowhead whale. The findings\u2014and the novel methods used to achieve them\u2014could help inform conservation efforts moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe were thinking about these whales all wrong,\u201d says study co-author Peter Corkeron, a marine ecologist at Griffith University in Australia, to the Guardian\u2019s Petra Stock. \u201cIt\u2019s impeded our ability to get it right when it comes to doing the science for conservation to stop these whales from going extinct.\u201d\n\nEstimating the age of some individual whales is relatively easy. For example, a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) killed in 2007 had a harpoon tip stuck in its blubber that was manufactured in the late 1800s, allowing researchers to surmise it was at least 115 years old.\n\nBut deducing the average life expectancy of an entire species can be more challenging. For one, past methods\u2014such as analyzing their earwax, which builds up each year like the rings of a tree\u2014have required whales to be dead. In addition, commercial whaling was so intense throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that most of the largest, oldest animals were likely missing from researchers\u2019 calculations. Most of today\u2019s longevity estimates are probably skewed by an overrepresentation of younger whales, the team writes in the paper.\n\nSo, for the new study, researchers deployed some new tactics. Using photos of right whales dating back to the 1970s, they identified individual females based on their appearance and noted when they stopped showing up in photos, presumably because they died. Then, they incorporated this information into statistical models that are similar to those used by life insurance companies to estimate human life expectancy.\n\nThese novel methods are \u201cquite impressive,\u201d as C. Scott Baker, an ecologist at Oregon State University who was not involved with the paper, tells Science\u2019s Mitch Leslie. \u201cThey make a good case for the plausibility of their results.\u201d\n\nThe findings suggest southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) have a median lifespan of about 73 years. But up to 10 percent might live to be 131 years old\u2014and a handful may even approach 150. That\u2019s much higher than previous estimates, which suggested the marine mammals had a maximum life expectancy between 70 and 80 years.\n\nResearchers used the same techniques for North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), a critically endangered species with an estimated 372 individuals remaining. The study finds that North Atlantic right whales have a median lifespan of just 22 years, with the longest-living 10 percent surpassing the age of 47.\n\nOverall, the findings reinforce the idea that these animals are still bouncing back from the damage wrought by commercial whaling, a practice that ended less than four decades ago.\n\n\u201cTo attain healthy populations that include old animals, recovery might take hundreds of years,\u201d says study lead author Greg Breed, an ecologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, in a statement. \u201cFor animals that live to be 100 or 150 and only give birth to a surviving calf every 10 years or so, slow recovery is to be expected.\u201d\n\nWhy such a big life expectancy gap between southern and North Atlantic right whales? Scientists suspect North Atlantic right whales are much more vulnerable because of where they live. They primarily inhabit Atlantic coastal waters near Canada and the United States\u2014a bustling region with lots of commercial activity.\n\nThis month alone, three North Atlantic right whales were seen tangled in fishing gear off the East Coast of the U.S. They\u2019re also susceptible to boat strikes and climate change.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a maze of rope these animals need to get through, and there\u2019s huge ports coming into the U.S., there\u2019s lots of shipping,\u201d Corkeron tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s Sam Bradbrook and Samantha Goerling.\n\nThe Southern Ocean, meanwhile, is not nearly as congested. One takeaway from the study is that \u201cit\u2019s important to keep it that way,\u201d Corkeron adds.\n\nMoving forward, researchers say their methods could be applied to other species, such as blue, fin, sei, humpback, gray and sperm whales. And, in the meantime, their recent findings could lead to the development of more effective conservation plans.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding how long wild animals live has major implications for how to best protect them,\u201d Corkeron and Breed write in the Conversation. \u201cAnimals that have very long lifespans usually reproduce extremely slowly and can go many years between births. \u2026 Conservation and management strategies that do not plan accordingly will have a higher chance of failure. This is especially important given the expected impacts of climate disruption.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The latest AI model from OpenAI achieved an \u201cimpressive leap in performance\u201d but it still hasn\u2019t demonstrated what experts classify as human-level intelligence\n\nOpenAI announced a breakthrough achievement for its new o3 AI model Rokas Tenys / Alamy\n\nOpenAI\u2019s new o3 artificial intelligence model has achieved a breakthrough high score on a prestigious AI reasoning test called the ARC Challenge, inspiring some AI fans to speculate that o3 has achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI). But even as ARC Challenge organisers described o3\u2019s achievement as a major milestone, they also cautioned that it has not won the competition\u2019s grand prize \u2013 and it is only one step on the path towards AGI, a term for hypothetical future AI with human-like intelligence.\n\nThe o3 model is the latest in a line of AI releases that follow on from the large language models powering ChatGPT. \u201cThis is a surprising and important step-function increase in AI capabilities, showing novel task adaptation ability never seen before in the GPT-family models,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, an engineer at Google and the main creator of the ARC Challenge, in a blog post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat did OpenAI\u2019s o3 model actually do?\n\nChollet designed the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) Challenge in 2019 to test how well AIs can find correct patterns linking pairs of coloured grids. Such visual puzzles are intended to make AIs demonstrate a form of general intelligence with basic reasoning capabilities. But throwing enough computing power at the puzzles could let even a non-reasoning program simply solve them through brute force. To prevent this, the competition also requires official score submissions to meet certain limits on computing power.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s newly announced o3 model \u2013 which is scheduled for release in early 2025 \u2013 achieved its official breakthrough score of 75.7 per cent on the ARC Challenge\u2019s \u201csemi-private\u201d test, which is used for ranking competitors on a public leaderboard. The computing cost of its achievement was approximately $20 for each visual puzzle task, meeting the competition\u2019s limit of less than $10,000 total. However, the harder \u201cprivate\u201d test that is used to determine grand prize winners has an even more stringent computing power limit, equivalent to spending just 10 cents on each task, which OpenAI did not meet.\n\nThe o3 model also achieved an unofficial score of 87.5 per cent by applying approximately 172 times more computing power than it did on the official score. For comparison, the typical human score is 84 per cent, and an 85 per cent score is enough to win the ARC Challenge\u2019s $600,000 grand prize \u2013 if the model can also keep its computing costs within the required limits.\n\nSign up to our The Daily newsletter The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nBut to reach its unofficial score, o3\u2019s cost soared to thousands of dollars spent solving each task. OpenAI requested that the challenge organisers not publish the exact computing costs.\n\nDoes this o3 achievement show that AGI has been reached?\n\nNo, the ARC challenge organisers have specifically said they do not consider beating this competition benchmark to be an indicator of having achieved AGI.\n\nThe o3 model also failed to solve more than 100 visual puzzle tasks, even when OpenAI applied a very large amount of computing power toward the unofficial score, said Mike Knoop, an ARC Challenge organiser at software company Zapier, in a social media post on X.\n\nIn a social media post on Bluesky, Melanie Mitchell at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico said the following about o3\u2019s progress on the ARC benchmark: \u201cI think solving these tasks by brute-force compute defeats the original purpose\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile the new model is very impressive and represents a big milestone on the way towards AGI, I don\u2019t believe this is AGI \u2013 there\u2019s still a fair number of very easy [ARC Challenge] tasks that o3 can\u2019t solve,\u201d said Chollet in another X post.\n\nHowever, Chollet described how we might know when human-level intelligence has been demonstrated by some form of AGI. \u201cYou\u2019ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible,\u201d he said in the blog post.\n\nThomas Dietterich at Oregon State University suggests another way to recognise AGI. \u201cThose architectures claim to include all of the functional components required for human cognition,\u201d he says. \u201cBy this measure, the commercial AI systems are missing episodic memory, planning, logical reasoning and, most importantly, meta-cognition.\u201d\n\nSo what does o3\u2019s high score really mean?\n\nThe o3 model\u2019s high score comes as the tech industry and AI researchers have been reckoning with a slower pace of progress in the latest AI models for 2024, compared with the initial explosive developments of 2023.\n\nAlthough it did not win the ARC Challenge, o3\u2019s high score indicates that AI models could beat the competition benchmark in the near future. Beyond its unofficial high score, Chollet says many official low-compute submissions have already scored above 81 per cent on the private evaluation test set.\n\nDietterich also thinks that \u201cthis is a very impressive leap in performance\u201d. However, he cautions that, without knowing more about how OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3 models work, it is impossible to evaluate just how impressive the high score is. For instance, if o3 was able to practise the ARC problems in advance, then that would make its achievement easier. \u201cWe will need to await an open-source replication to understand the full significance of this,\u201d says Dietterich.\n\nThe ARC Challenge organisers are already looking to launch a second and more difficult set of benchmark tests sometime in 2025. They will also keep the ARC Prize 2025 challenge running until someone achieves the grand prize and open-sources their solution."

Oleksandr Syrskyi -- on the ongoing battle in Kursk, underway since Ukrainian troops launched a surprise cross-border incursion there in August.\n\n\"There are risks of sending additional soldiers and military equipment to the Russian army from North Korea,\" Zelenskyy said, vowing \"tangible responses\" to any such move. \"According to preliminary data, the number of killed and wounded North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region already exceeds 3,000 people.\"\n\nUkrainian special forces claimed on Monday to have inflicted more than 100 casualties among North Korean forces over three days of operations.\n\nKorean People's Army soldiers are pictured at Mansu Hill in Pyongyang, North Korea on Dec. 17, 2019. Kim Won Jin/AFP via Getty Images\n\nUkraine's Special Operations Forces branch claimed in a post to its official Telegram channel that 77 North Koreans were killed and 40 wounded in recent fighting.\n\nOn Sunday, the SSO posted photos of what it said were North Korean troops killed in Russia's western Kursk region. The SSO also uploaded photos of purportedly fabricated Russian military identity cards. ABC News was not immediately able to independently verify the images.\n\n\"Russia is trying to hide the presence of military personnel from North Korea by issuing them with fake documents,\" the SSO wrote.\n\nIt added that the documents \"do not have all the seals, photographs, the patronymics are given in the Russian manner and the place of birth is signed as the Republic of Tuva,\" the home region of Sergei Shoigu -- formerly Russia's defense minister and now the secretary of the Security Council.\n\nThe SSO said the signatures of the document owners were written in Korean, which it said \"indicates the real origin of these soldiers.\"\n\nU.S., South Korean and Ukrainian officials have said there are currently up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers inside Russia, deployed there primarily to help push Kyiv's forces out of positions taken in Kursk.\n\nUkrainian military sources told ABC News in November that North Koreans were expected to be among the 50,000 troops arrayed for a major counter-offensive in Kursk.\n\nThe deployment of troops marks a new milestone in North Korean support for Russia's war, Pyongyang already having supplied Moscow with ammunition and weapons -- including ballistic missiles -- since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this month that Kyiv has \"preliminary data that the Russians have begun to use North Korean soldiers in their assaults -- a significant number of them.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence, meanwhile, has reported \"significant casualties\" among North Korean troops deployed on the front lines alongside Russian units.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un attends a ceremony in North Pyongan Province, North Korea, on Dec. 21, 2024 in this photo released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency. Kcna/via Reuters\n\nSouth Korea's Yonhap news agency reported on Monday that Seoul expects Pyongyang to send more troops and equipment to Russia.\n\n\"North Korea is preparing to rotate or increase the deployment of troops [in Russia], while currently supplying 240mm rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled artillery,\" said South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, as quoted by Yonhap.\n\n\"There are also some signs of [the North] moving to manufacture and supply suicide drones,\" the JCS said.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a drone production and test facility in November. Then, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Kim \"underscored the need to build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production.\""

            "article_content": "What more can you say about the drones that are attacking\u2014or, correction, appear to be attacking\u2014New Jersey? You\u2019ve heard all the theories: Iranian spy drones launched from a ship; drones launched by China; drones launched from locations known only to the President and the Pentagon (via the President-elect Donald Trump, who said, \u201cSomething strange is going on\u201d). The friendlier theories have it that the drones are searching for something\u2014e.g., a radioactive medical device that the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection had, in fact, reported missing, on December 5th. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably us, listening and watching,\u201d Michael Melham, the mayor of Belleville, said. (The lost device, used for CAT scans, was found by FedEx.) But, if you head out into central Jersey on a cold, clear night to look for stuff, Melham\u2019s words resonate. \u201cI never saw anything like it,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cDozens and dozens of drones, coming in from all different areas. We were swarmed last night.\u201d\n\nThe sky started looking unusual in November\u2014first in central Jersey, along the Raritan River, then north, into the Highlands. Then drones were spotted in Monmouth County, where the sheriff told Fox News that he wants the legal authority to \u201cde-drone.\u201d Drones were in the Pine Barrens, inching into Staten Island, and also in the Bronx. Local news posted videos that are either hard to discern or feature planes or helicopters landing somewhere in a state with close to five hundred places to land planes or helicopters. One North Jersey reporter likened his daily commute to the helicopter scene in \u201cGoodFellas.\u201d\n\nAs thousands began to report seeing drones, some the size of cars, officials were stumped. Sometimes the reports were actually drones. But mostly not, and, when some police drones filmed real drones, the real drones seemed to vanish. A big issue: drones are everywhere. There are a million registered in the U.S., deployed by the police, and now delivering Jersey Mike\u2019s subs in Holly Springs, North Carolina.\n\nIn the gap between what authorities can verify and what they can\u2019t, more drone questions take flight, especially on WKXW, a.k.a. New Jersey 101.5. \u201cWe\u2019re talking drones,\u201d Bill Spadea, the host of the morning-drive show, said recently. \u201cWhy? \u2019Cause that\u2019s what everybody\u2019s talking about.\u201d In between ads for toenail-fungus treatment, people call in with sightings, and Spadea asks drone questions. \u201cDo you buy into the fact that they lost a nuclear package?\u201d he asked Brian Fitzherbert, a Republican defense contractor from South Jersey.\n\n\u201cThat one\u2019s a tough one,\u201d Fitzherbert said.\n\nSpadea, who is running for governor as a pro-Trump Republican, is the former host of \u201cChasing News,\u201d a defunct local Fox program; he frames drone sightings in anti-government ire. \u201cAs governor, I would order a state of emergency, put the national Air Guard on alert, and mobilize our state police to start chasing these drones down,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, we\u2019ll find out whose side our federal government is really on.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver since we got married, you don\u2019t chase me around the tree trunk, halt suddenly, then continue chasing me around like you used to.\u201d Cartoon by Tom Toro Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nSky-watchers note: New Jersey has a history of hoaxes. The Great Morristown U.F.O. Hoax\u2014in which two men attached red flares to helium balloons, in 2009\u2014had people seeing things for weeks, despite the police saying they were \u201creasonably certain . . . that they were red flares attached to a balloon.\u201d\n\nThe most famous hoax centered on Grovers Mill, the hamlet that a scriptwriter randomly chose as the Martian-landing site in Orson Welles\u2019s 1938 radio adaptation of \u201cThe War of the Worlds.\u201d If you showed up at the fake landing site last week, you could feel a little something in the air, perhaps because the Defense Department had not yet set up the finely tuned drone-detection devices being shipped into the state, a system invented to prevent bird strikes at airports.\n\nOn the town pond, house lights reflected in the water. The geese flew overhead, honking loudly, though invisible. If you had a telescope, you would have spotted a quick orange glow, low, at the dark edge of the woods, but then would have realized that it was only a cigarette held by a distant smoker. But somehow, before packing up, you could look in the telescope and see a giant incandescent sphere with three white orbs circling it: Jupiter, brighter even than the stars. \u2666"
