            "article_content": "(Stacker) - When pilot Kenneth Arnold took off from Chehalis, Washington, in his single-engine airplane one afternoon in June 1947, he was looking for a lost military aircraft that had crashed. But what he found was something completely different\u2014something that would set off a cultural obsession in the U.S. that persists today.\n\nWhile flying around Mount Rainier, Arnold reportedly encountered nine curious, wingless objects speeding through the sky at 1,200 mph, faster than any plane at the time could. Arnold spent years afterward trying to describe what he had seen, reportedly using a term that has been ingrained in the American lexicon ever since: \"flying saucer.\"\n\nSince then, Americans have been uniquely fixated on the idea that aliens are somewhere in the sky above us\u2014and the number who believe that to be true is growing. In 2019, a Gallup survey found that 33% of Americans believed some UFOs were alien spacecrafts, while 60% felt they could all be explained by human activity or some natural phenomenon. Just two years later, in 2021, 41% of respondents said they believed at least some UFOs were alien-related compared to 50% who were confident any sightings could be explained by human behavior or scientific events.\n\nThere are two main reasons that belief in aliens has become so prevalent in the United States: government hearings and pop culture.\n\nAmerica\u2019s film industry has always been one of the most influential in the world, and a wave of science fiction films in the 1950s, like \u201cThe Day the Earth Stood Still\u201d and \u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers,\u201d perpetuated the idea that there are other life-forms out there. This continues today with alien-centric sci-fi staples like the \u201cAvatar\u201d franchise and the \u201cQuiet Place\u201d movies dominating the box office.\n\nRather than leave flying saucers to the domain of Hollywood, the U.S. government has addressed the question of UFOs, only adding further speculation. In April 2020, the Department of Defense released multiple videos filmed by military pilots that were thought to possibly capture UFOs. In July 2023, an Air Force veteran came forward to the House of Representatives claiming that the U.S. military has been keeping important information on \u201cnonhuman\u201d sightings secret since the 1930s.\n\nJust like it did in the 1950s amid Cold War paranoia, the lore of UFOs is also currently experiencing a resurgence as many Americans grow concerned about national security. The infamous Chinese spy balloon panic in 2023 and fears over being infiltrated by the Russian government have led to many reporting seeing UFOs in the sky. People are also mistaking the spike in Starlink satellites for extraterrestrial activity. In November 2024, the Pentagon announced that most reported sightings of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs, as they\u2019re now known) can be attributed to balloons, drones, and other regular objects, while still noting that many objects lack a sufficient explanation.\n\nUAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it\u2019s easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they\u2019ve seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWhile New Mexico and Nevada are perhaps best known for UFO sightings, the National UFO Reporting Center data shows that the state with the most sightings is California, with more than 16,500 reports as of Nov. 21, 2024. But what do the numbers look like in your metro area?\n\nStacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Wisconsin using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis.\n\nFor now, the U.S. government\u2019s official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America\u2019s alien obsession.\n\nNote: The images in this article are stock photos and do not necessarily depict the specific cities or events described listed.\n\nSergey Tinyakov // Shutterstock\n\n#10.

            "article_content": "The recent congressional hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), formerly known as UFOs, has ignited a call for transparency from lawmakers across the political spectrum.\n\nDuring the hearing, Chairwoman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, Nancy Mace, said:\n\n\u201cI obviously would like to know how much taxpayers are spending on this. You have the right to know. And if we are spending money on something that doesn\u2019t exist, why are we spending the money? And if it does exist, why are we hiding it from the public? Of course, national security is a big issue and if there is technology that could harm us or our allies that are in the hands of our adversaries, we obviously want to stay ahead of that to the best of our abilities.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Defense, which oversees UAP research, is set to receive a proposed budget of $850 billion in 2025. However, the exact amount spent on UAP research remains unclear, contributing to congressional frustration over the perceived secrecy surrounding the issue. The Department of Defense\u2019s All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), established in 2022, is tasked with investigating these phenomena.\n\nA group of bipartisan lawmakers in Congress introduced the UAP Transparency Act, which would require the declassification of all federal documents related to UAPs. The bill mandates that the president instruct federal agencies to release UAP research documents to the public within 270 days and provide Congress with quarterly progress reports. The UAP Transparency Act was referred to the House Oversight and Accountability Committee in May, but no further action has been taken.\n\nAARO reviewed 757 new UAP reports between May 2023 and June 2024, identifying 21 cases that \u201cmerit further analysis\u201d due to their \u201canomalous characteristics and/or behaviors.\u201d Despite these findings, AARO\u2019s report stated there is no evidence to suggest extraterrestrial life is responsible for these sightings.\n\n\u201cThere are interesting cases that I, with my physics and engineering background and time in the intelligence community, do not understand. And I don\u2019t know anybody else who understands them either,\u201d said Jon Kosloski, the director of AARO.\n\nHave a news tip? Contact Emma Withrow at ewithrow@sbgtv.com or at x.com/emma_withrow.

One expert explained that the lights were only a phenomenon that shows nothing but a reflection in the night sky.\n\nAn ominous quartet of gleaming lights above the US Capitol building, like landing lights on some otherworldly craft, have left some afraid the alien invasion has finally arrived.

            "article_content": "The one 1980s horror movie Guillermo del Toro called a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d\n\nHorror fans are some of the most dedicated audiences the world of cinema has ever known. Unlike any other genre categorisation, those who profess their love of the paranormal, blood, gore, terror and villains are as steadfast and diligent in their adoration and usually have a near-encyclopaedic knowledge of the subject matter. One of the genre\u2019s premier directors, Guillermo del Toro, has a similar breadth of understanding, meaning when he picks out a favourite horror movie, it\u2019s best to pay attention.\n\nWhen looking for a list of movies to watch, your best bet to get an essential watching list is to listen to legendary directors. When scratching the surface of the stranger side of cinema in the modern era then there\u2019s a good chance the work of Guillermo del Toro would pop up. However, the filmmaker has been immersed in the movie business for as longas he can remember.\n\nFor director Guillermo del Toro, movies aren\u2019t a part of life; they are life. After discovering cinema as a child, del Toro promptly abandoned his original ambition of being a marine biologist vis-\u00e0-vis Jacques Costeau and stepped into an elaborate fantasy world informed by an entire century of cinematic innovation. His sinister vision reached maturity in the early 1990s with his directorial debut Cronos. After the success of his science-fiction follow up, Mimic in 1997, del Toro hit on a winning streak, releasing The Devil\u2019s Backbone in 2001, Hell Boy in 2004 and his revered anti-fascist fairy tale, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth, in 2006.\n\nSpeaking to Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin in 2019, del Toro said: \u201cEverything I\u2019ve done, even the most commercially viable ones, they have some weirdness in them. When you\u2019re on a set, and you\u2019ve absorbed 100 years of cinema, your first instinct, the regular instinct, is the wrong instinct. You have to say, \u2018OK, that is the way it would normally happen in a movie. What can we do that is different?\u2019 And you stop yourself. You have to stop yourself. The older you get, the more you want to go different.\u201d\n\nDel Toro has found inspiration in countless pictures, including the 1980 ghost story classic The Changeling. Made in Canada with legendary filmmaker Peter Medak at the helm, the film is now regarded as a piece of cinematic gold. Starring George C Scott as a grief-stricken composer who moves into a haunted mansion, the picture is apparently based on a true story; the haunting of Russell Hunter. The director of Pan\u2019s Labirynth professed his love for the film when meeting the director at the 2018 BAFTAs.\n\n\u201cI was in London at the BAFTA Awards, and Guillermo was screaming, \u2018You\u2019re my mentor! You\u2019re my mentor!'\u201d Medak told The Lineup. \u201cI said, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 He said, \u2018Your movie The Changeling is just a masterpiece.'\u201d It\u2019s the kind of appreciation you\u2019d expect from a regular cinemagoer; however, it was clearly special to hear it from del Toro. \u201cIt\u2019s just nice to hear that from fellow directors whose work I love and respect,\u201d Medak said.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make it very psychological, so it didn\u2019t have any cheap shocks in it,\u201d Medak told Entertainment Weekly of the film\u2019s unique positioning within the horror genre. \u201cThat was very important to me.\u201d Make sure you add the 1980s film Guillermo del Toro called a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d, The Changeling, to your essential watch list."

            "article_content": "Today, a big blockbuster launching in and/or getting filmed with IMAX cameras isn\u2019t much of a novelty. It\u2019s more shocking when a massive tentpole doesn\u2019t have the support of IMAX screens. These titles contribute mightily to an average blockbuster movie\u2019s grosses in the modern world, with audiences specifically seeking out new Avatar or Dune installments in this format. Nearly every week brings a new feature into your local IMAX auditorium, making it typically unsurprising to hear a certain motion picture received an IMAX theatrical run. It\u2019s just a cornerstone of the theatrical business, now.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nHowever, in the 20 years since Treasure Planet began the practice of launching new release movies simultaneously in traditional theaters and IMAX runs, not every title that\u2019s received an IMAX launch has become as synonymous with the format as, say, Avengers: Endgame or Oppenheimer. In fact, over time there have been several movies that will seem like total head-scratchers over how and why they played in IMAX theaters. Behold\u2026a collection of motion pictures that seem antithetical to the IMAX experience, yet played in these auditoriums all the same.\n\nThe Earliest Inexplicable IMAX Releases\n\nLegendary Pictures / Warner Bros. \u201cThe Ant Bully\u201d\n\nIn the earliest days of English-language narrative films receiving IMAX releases, there was real selectiveness on what films played in this format. However, that tendency didn\u2019t prevent The Ant Bully from playing in IMAX 3D auditoriums back in late July 2006. Only the second fully animated IMAX 3D feature in history (following fellow Warner Bros. title The Polar Express), this feature proved an instant box office bomb upon its opening weekend. The Ant Bully has faded into obscurity, yet it technically holds an important historical position as one of the earliest IMAX 3D narrative films.\n\nThe Ant Bully began a streak of inexplicable titles launching in the IMAX format. Such inexplicableness tended to orient around IMAX auditoriums making room for titles that didn\u2019t fit into the realms of family features, action tentpoles, or concert movies. Anytime IMAX auditoriums strayed from those molds, it was more than a bit odd. An early instance of this came with October 2010\u2019s Paranormal Activity 2. Grainy camcorder footage is the name of the game for this saga. Would that kind of imagery really look exceptional blown up to an IMAX screen?\n\n2010 and 2011 largely featured expected motion pictures making their way into IMAX screens. In May 2012, though, heads turned over news that June 2012 feature Rock of Ages would launch on IMAX screens. A musical movie doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea for an IMAX experience given how this genre is known for grand visuals and spectacle. Titles like 3 Idiots, La La Land, and Moulin Rouge! would look great on IMAX screens thanks to their expansively lavish musical numbers. However, Rock of Ages emphasizes grimier, small-scale bursts of musicality. It just doesn\u2019t have the glorious imagery of, say, Wicked.\n\nStarting in 2012, IMAX screens started getting almost weekly new movies, which slightly increased the number of inexplicable choices for features launched in this format. The Will Smith/Margot Robbie crime movie Focus, for instance, launched in IMAX theaters in late February 2015. It\u2019s the kind of low-to-the-ground feature that doesn\u2019t exactly sparkle on massive IMAX screens.\n\nHave Inexplicable IMAX Movies Continued in Recent Years?\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures has always had a great relationship with IMAX screens, which could explain why the studio puts even seemingly incompatible movies like Focus into IMAX auditoriums. Two months after Focus, Warner Bros. put out another puzzling feature into a domestic IMAX run: The Water Diviner. This Russell Crowe directorial effort didn\u2019t even launch in wide release in North America, but it did get a splashy IMAX run in this territory. At the end of summer 2015, EuropaCorp title The Transporter Refueled scored IMAX screens despite turning into one of the season\u2019s biggest duds.\n\nIn December 2017, a rate kind of genre graced IMAX screens: a straightforward comedy movie. Not an action/comedy, but a general comedy featuring Seth Rogen and James Franco. This title was The Disaster Artist, which also functioned as one of A24\u2019s earliest forays into IMAX releases. Audiences could hear Franco say \u201coh hai Mark\u201d in IMAX speakers, as God intended. 2018 largely saw typical expected titles from all over the world (including big Indian and Chinese blockbusters) make their way into IMAX screens. However, at the dawn of 2020, Tom Hooper\u2019s Cats graced IMAX theaters in Japan. This tremendous exploitation of IMAX technology was presumably restricted to just one country solely to contain the sheer power of Skimbleshanks in IMAX.\n\nClearly, as long as IMAX theaters are open and need new movies to play on a regular basis, there\u2019ll always be inexplicable features launching in this format. As late as September 2021, grounded musical Dear Evan Hansen had a one-week run in IMAX theaters, while 2022 saw Amsterdam playing in IMAX venues for unexplainable reasons. IMAX has left the days of The Ant Bully far behind in terms of its pop culture notoriety. However, this format will clearly never leave the practice of projecting highly unexpected movies fully in the past."

Are you just buying for yourself or do you need to support the whole family? You need a license for each person using Microsoft Office at any one time, so make sure you buy something that works for everyone. Also, think about extras like how much cloud storage is bundled in. For the most part though, it\u2019s a pretty simple process buying Microsoft Office.\n\nHow we chose these Microsoft Office products on Cyber Monday\n\nWe know our way around deals, as well as what\u2019s important with Microsoft Office. We spend every day looking for the best deals, checking out all the major retailers, and comparing prices. Because of that, we know what prices are worth recommending and what should be skipped. In conjunction, we know all about Microsoft Office along with the pros and cons of buying a subscription to 365 or going for a onetime purchase. We can recommend different services for different people with plenty of knowledge backing that view up. Essentially, all the deals above are the kind of deals that we would recommend to our friends and family, and that we would use ourselves. There\u2019s no filler here or any substandard packages. We only include genuinely good products here, which luckily tends to encompass most of what Microsoft Office provides as standard. We also check back regularly and update the deals with the latest best prices."
