            "article_content": "In the vast skies over Wyoming, things aren\u2019t always as they seem. That\u2019s why the Cowboy State is one of the best places to see and possibly explain the unexplainable.\n\nThe National UFO Center keeps records of every sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) reported in the United States since 1995.\n\nThe website Stacker used that data to compile a list of the top 10 with the most reports of strange, inexplainable sights in the night sky.\n\nThe world of UFO and UAP sightings has gotten more serious in the last several years, and more people are looking up and looking for answers.\n\n\u201cI can tell you is that quite a few sightings in Wyoming remain unexplained,\u201d said Richard Beckwith, Rock Springs city attorney and part-time UFO investigator.\n\nHe\u2019s spent decades investigating UFO sightings in Wyoming, but had his first personal experience with one spotted near Green River earlier in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon is real,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the Pentagon has admitted UFOs and UAFs are real, and they can\u2019t explain them. It was treated as a joke for most of the time I\u2019ve been doing it, and now it\u2019s become real.\u201d\n\nThe List\n\nOverall, the National UFO Center has 421 reports of UFOs and UAFs in Wyoming. Cheyenne tops the list of Wyoming places with the most sightings, reporting 50 aerial phenomena since 1995.\n\nSeeing Cheyenne at the top doesn\u2019t surprise Beckwith at all. One would expect more sightings in Wyoming\u2019s most populated city, but Cheyenne is also home to a critical U.S. Air Force base.\n\n\u201cWyoming\u2019s UFO sightings, from my perspective, primarily appear over the Warren Air Force Base and the nearby missile silos,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been quite a few sightings, going back to the 1950s.\u201d\n\nCasper is second with 37 UFO sightings, followed by Laramie with 29, Rock Springs with 17 and Gillette with 15. Cody, Sheridan, Riverton and Evanston round out the bottom half of the list.\n\nYellowstone National Park sits at the bottom with eight UFO sightings. Sasquatch isn\u2019t the only elusive and mysterious thing hanging around the pristine wilderness of northwest Wyoming.\n\nThe state that\u2019s seen and reported the most UFOs is California, with more than 16,500 sightings. The Pentagon attributes most of these sightings to balloons, drones, aircraft and other terrestrial sources.\n\nOne thing Wyomingites won\u2019t want to do is try to shoot down any UFOs they spot. If that UFO happens to be a neighbor\u2019s drone, that would violate federal law and could come with a fine and a jail sentence .\n\nNot Explaining The Unexplainable\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that the number of sightings corresponds with Wyoming\u2019s most populated areas. Beckwith said that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been, but that doesn\u2019t make these phenomena any easier to explain.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, we had the simple explanation that these were aliens from another planet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the longer I\u2019ve done this, the explanations have become more elusive. It\u2019s much more complex than that.\u201d\n\nModern-day theories for UFOs and UAP include black technology programs, foreign espionage and astronomical events in addition to the extraterrestrial. If there are any probable explanations for what\u2019s been seen over Wyoming and elsewhere, the federal government has declined to comment or elaborate.\n\n\u201cThey continue to say emphatically that we have no evidence that these objects are extraterrestrial in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cThat begs the question \u2014 if they can\u2019t explain it, how can they determine that these objects are also simultaneously not manufactured elsewhere? It's almost like, \u2018Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.\u2019\u201d\n\nRecently, there have been three congressional hearings on UFOs and UAFs, and Beckwith said he\u2019s spoken with two members of U.S. Congress about the phenomenon. Wyoming scientists are skeptical of their findings, but Beckwith described it as one of the rare bipartisan issues that has reached Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPeople who looked at this phenomenon were ridiculed about this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s changed since 2017, now that the government has admitted they\u2019re real.\u201d\n\nWyoming Watchers\n\nBeckwith is one of four Wyoming field investigators for the Mutual UFO Network, an organization of civilian volunteers that follow up on and report UFO and UAF sightings. The number of investigators shows Beckwith how much interest has grown for these unexplainable phenomena in the last decade.\n\n\u201cI have investigators in Cheyenne, Riverton, and two in Rock Springs that investigate sightings all over the state,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil a couple of years ago, I was the only one.\u201d\n\nBeckwith described his first experience with a UFO back in March. He used his Sony SR4 camera to capture a video of \u201canomalous nocturnal lights\u201d hovering near Green River.\n\n\u201cI got the radar records from that night, but haven\u2019t been able to correlate what I saw with any particular targets on the radar,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly didn't have a transponder. So, to that extent, I can't explain it. But I saw and filmed it.\u201d\n\nBeckwith hopes more Wyomingites will report any UFO or UAF sightings to the National UFO Center or the Mutual UFO Network. Regardless of what people believe they've seen in the sky, he and many others want answers.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of space and open sky in Wyoming. Beckwith believes the Cowboy State could be the key to getting better data and information to shine more light into the darkness surrounding UFOs and UAFs.\n\n\u201cWyoming is the ninth-largest state in land area, and we have the lowest population,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, we have sightings with several witnesses in different locations. They\u2019re rarer than other places, but they still occur.\u201d\n\nAndrew Rossi can be reached at arossi@cowboystatedaily.com."

            "article_content": "It\u2019s a weird time to be a UFO enthusiast \u2014 especially one who finds lights in the sky inspiring rather than frightening. As real-life conspiracy theories flourish and big screen space horror is set lightyears away, I find myself contextualizing my UFO feelings in a surprisingly rural story. To me, the quintessential UFO horror movie is M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s 2002 film Signs.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nSigns is a sci-fi thriller set on a farm in rural Pennsylvania, starring Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix as brothers Graham and Merrill Hess. For what it\u2019s worth, if you haven\u2019t seen this movie you may still be familiar with the parody Scary Movie 3. However, if you\u2019re around my age you may also remember Signs as the first time you consciously thought of UFOs as frightening rather than fascinating. The movie tells an original story while still playing with the archetypal concept of UFOs in American pop culture.\n\nThe movie begins by tackling a hot topic in the Ufology community: crop circles. In real life, these have mostly been debunked as pranks, contrivances or environmental coincidences, and in the movie the Hess family brushes them off first as well. Instead, the beginning of the movie focuses on their family struggles \u2014 Graham was an Episcopal priest until his wife died in a car crash about six months ago, and he lost his faith. Merrill\u2019s minor league baseball career stopped short and now he is here on the farm trying to help his brother, niece and nephew all process their grief.\n\nIn the midst of this, crop circles begin to take over the mainstream news, and they get harder and harder for Graham and Merrill to ignore. The brothers begin to see strange figures appearing in their field but they\u2019re unable to catch them. They also hear odd, inhuman noises through a baby monitor. Before they know it, a worldwide alien invasion is underway.\n\nAside from the Hess brothers, the key cast members are Graham\u2019s son Morgan (Rory Culkin) and his daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin). They are also visited by their friend and local police officer Caroline Paski (Cherry Jones) and their neighbor Ray Reddy, who is played by Shyamalan himself. Behind the scenes, the credits were stacked as well \u2014 producers included Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall and Sam Mercer.\n\nSigns was filmed in Pennsylvania on a budget of $72 million, and was considered a box office success with an international gross of over $408 million. It was Shyamalan\u2019s second-biggest earner at the time behind The Sixth Sense. The movie also sold well on VHS and DVD, and is beloved by film buffs for its extensive bonus content including deleted scenes, documentary featurettes and storyboards. This movie alone earned nearly $35 million in DVD rental revenue between January and March of 2003.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Signs has a 75 percent fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.9 out of 10 among 240 trusted critics. Those that loved the film praised its pacing, suspense and jump scares while those who disliked it questioned its approach to collective terror in the wake if the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That last issue may be part of the reason Signs has seemed to age well \u2014 when its allowed to be considered outside of that context, it feels more authentic.\n\nAs for its take on the aliens themselves, Signs is far from the scariest. However, it does what other space horrors fail to do in making the danger feel close to home \u2014 like it could happen to you just as you leave the theater. The logical part of my mind knows I\u2019d have a better chance against the creatures from Signs than I would against that thing from Alien: Romulus, yet the emotional response comes from seeing the alien in an earthly home rather than a distant space station.\n\nSome viewers complain that the ending of Signs is abrupt and contrived. Without spoiling anything, I can say I hope the headlines about drone sightings and military UAP disclosures turn out to have simple endings as well. At the time of this writing, Signs is not available on any subscription-based streamers, but it is on PVOD stores as well as physical media."

            "article_content": "While official reports of eerie drone-like UFOs dropped over the holidays, New Jersey residents are still coming forward with bizarre encounters.\n\nTwo witnesses in Manalapan Township, for example, videotaped a bus-sized, 25- to 50-foot-long black triangle UFO that they saw 'pull off a high g [force] maneuver over a residential area' just days before Christmas.\n\nThe sighting, which lasted at least one minute, ended with the object zooming 'in the general direction of McGuire [Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst]' \u2014 matching a persistent pattern of 'drone' UFO incursions over US bases in recent years.\n\nAnother New Jersey skywatcher recorded what they described as a classic 'flying saucer' with an 'aura or haze around object' just three miles off the coast of Atlantic City.\n\nAnd still more Garden State witnesses now say they saw as many as 20 to 30 drones just this Wednesday night, which 'kind of hovered and all looked like miniature aircraft,' in an account posted to Facebook. 'Very disconcerting for sure,' one witness said.\n\nSome experts attribute the drop in official reports to law enforcement to expanded drone flight bans by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) across the tristate area.\n\nBut others, including former chief of the FBI's counter-drone unit Rob D'Amico, believe most of the sightings were errors and 'hysteria' to begin with, suggesting that the decline might be nothing more than a case of the 'mystery drone' fever breaking.\n\n'I truly think that 90 percent of these sightings are manned aircraft,' D'Amico said. 'People have never looked up in the sky before to notice how crowded it is.'\n\nTwo witnesses in Manalapan, NJ, photographed a 25-50 foot-long black triangle UFO that they saw 'pull off a high g [force] maneuver over a residential area' just days before Christmas\n\n'When you look at them and the landing lights and the navigation lights and how they fly,' D'Amico argued in an interview with NJ Spotlight, 'they are manned aircraft.'\n\nBut local eyewitnesses are unconvinced by the past and present federal investigators dismissive assertions, with many acknowledging that the strange craft do resemble traditional aircraft.\n\nRich V. reported seeing a large drone buzzing over his in-laws' house in Somerset this Christmas.\n\nHe shared the details with DailyMail.com, saying it was flying lower than the average airplane and was the size of a private jet.\n\n'It went over homes so there was a reference point to see how low it was,' Rich said.\n\n'2 additional large drones flew over shortly after I left which I did not see first hand, but was told to expect it by my in-law in law enforcement,' he told DailyMail.com of the event, which occurred during a Christmas visit just last week.\n\nSomerset sits about 30 miles south of Newark airport where tons of planes fly in and out from all parts of the world.\n\nBut, as Rich took pains to emphasize, 'we checked the Flight Radar and there was no plane in the sky where we were at, which was Bound Brook NJ.'\n\nHis account of odd behavior by somewhat conventional-looking objects echoes the account from this past Wednesday night by a driver, Richie Sougstad, who spotted roughly 20-30 drones on his commute home through northern New Jersey.\n\nSougstad described the drones as being stationary except for two.\n\n'One was moving slowly about 20 mph, another one just kinda shot up into the atmosphere and disappeared from sight,' he shared online.\n\nBut the remaining two dozen or so, he explained, 'looked like mini airplanes but they were definitely bigger than my pick up truck.'\n\n'Crazy part to me was just how they hovered like a helicopter but just silently,' he said.\n\nOn December 21, 2024 at around 7:10pm in Atlantic City, one witness told NUFORC that they documented 'a strange flying saucer' that 'appeared to shake and change shape, but always returning to its original disc shape' (still image from the witnesses video submission above)\n\nThe two Manalapan witnesses who saw a 25-50 foot 'black triangle' UFO from little more than 400 yards above them along County Route 527 described the craft as 'silent' despite flying so 'quickly' that they initially thought it was a jet (above their second photo to NUFORC)\n\nExperts have said that many of the drone sightings were actually manned aircraft as seen in this image\n\nTales of more exotic-looking drones or UFOs spotted in recent weeks over New Jersey, as reported to the nonprofit National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), have also curiously kept to these same 'bus-sized' dimensions.\n\nThe two Manalapan witnesses who saw a 25-50 foot 'black triangle' UFO from little more than 400 yards above them described the craft as 'silent' despite flying so 'quickly' that they initially thought it was a jet.\n\n'Took a screenshot from the vid and you can just make out a dark triangle angled around each of its 3 lights,' one of the two anonymous NUFORC witnesses reported.\n\nThe witness said that a friend claimed the sightings might have been a TR-3B: the legendary and still unconfirmed 'Black Manta' anti-gravity spy plane, alleged to have been made by US defense contractor Northrop in the early 1990s.\n\nThe black triangle, the said, was spotted above County Route 527 on December 18, 2024 at around 7:30pm ET.\n\nThree days later, on December 21 at around 7:10pm in Atlantic City, one witness told NUFORC that they documented 'a strange flying saucer' that 'appeared to shake and change shape, but always returning to its original disc shape.'\n\nShortly after this flying disk left, the witness said it was followed in apparent pursuit by a 'red/pink light' the size of basketball that flew past 'at high speed, flashing randomly and leaving a reddish trail in the sky.'\n\nBut the witness was only able to submit video of the first UFO to NUFORC.\n\nNewly elected New Jersey Senator Andy Kim told the public that, while the number of sightings reported to law enforcement have decreased, federal and local investigators are still working on the 100 or so cases that merit investigation.\n\n'DHS [Department of Homeland Security] detailed to me the array of tools they have in NJ for drone detection including thermal sensors, drone-specific radar, radio frequency kits, and visual monitors,' Senator Kim told his constituents just before Christmas.\n\nAnd even government experts who have criticized the 'media frenzy' and 'conspiracy theories' around the alleged drone sightings have said in recent weeks that some worst case scenarios can't be ruled out yet.\n\nThe former head of the Pentagon's UFO-hunting All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, published an op-ed in Scientific American Friday floating the risk that 'foreign or domestic bad actors' were probing US defenses.\n\n'Operators could be probing the limits of legal activities, or in military speak, performing or exploring preparation of the battlespace,' Dr Kirkpatrick wrote.\n\n'They could be flying commercial drones, complete with lights, to test reactions of both the public and the government. As long as they are flying within legal airspace, under legal limits, they can push those limits and measure what the reaction is.'\n\nThe now retired government physicist added that this response-time data could one day be used for 'attack planning, illegal drug delivery or other malicious intent.'\n\nDr Kirkpatrick added a few other possibilities including the chance that the drones' operators 'could be using them intentionally to whip up frenzy, hysteria and panic.'"

            "article_content": "> Tech\n\nA viral video reshared by Myra Moore, who goes by \u2018The Paranormal Chic\u2019 on social media, shows several beings brooding over the canopy of clouds.\n\nThe entities captured on film by a passenger on a commercial airline show them casting shadows as well, sparking curiosity among netizens. At the cursory glance, the video doesn\u2019t appear to be digitally altered or produced with any AI tools. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there,\u201d the narrator quipped. Humans cannot (if it isn\u2019t obvious) stand on clouds. They cannot stand over a sea of clouds either without some mechanism involving the modern technological marvel of parachutes, gliders, or planes. Are there entities out there? Or the aliens are just being too brazenly out in the open now? Or is there a sinister supernatural angle to the story?\n\nEven as the Internet debated, the mystery was quickly solved by online sleuths who presented evidence debunking the claim that the alleged beings on the video are sentients. Others took hilarious jibes on the video. Meanwhile, a few netizens shared similar shots from their own travels earlier. Per some, the figures are nothing but cloud stakes or pillar formations that stand out of the fluffy layer. A few suggested that these could also be smoke released from factory chimneys.\n\nMost likely industrial stacks pushing up warm moist air through the cloud bank.

The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there. What did they capture?\"\n\nCheck Out the Viral Video\n\nSince then, the video has gone viral, sparking a mix of reactions. Some viewers suggest that the figures could merely be people in a snowy landscape, while others propose more outlandish theories, including the idea that the sight could be steam rising from industrial gases or fog.\n\nA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?#theparanormalchic #alien #airline #paranormal #ufo #fyp pic.twitter.com/CARF6XFGxD \u2014 Myra Moore- The Paranormal Chic (@t_paranorm_chic) December 30, 2024\n\nThe clip\u2019s lack of clear location and timing has only added to the mystery, leaving many to wonder whether the sighting could have an otherworldly explanation. \"What did they capture?\" Moore asked, encouraging her followers to share their opinions and theories. The video has since gone viral on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where users are divided between humorous interpretations and more serious discussions about the potential implications of the footage.\n\nUsers Reaction to the Viral Post\n\nThe most conclusive explanation of the video was given by a twitter user with an image and he said that, \u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks.\u201d\n\nAnother one said, \u201cThat\u2019s wild.

It\u2019s the real-life couples of the hit 2000s paranormal romance series Twilight, based on the novels by Stephenie Meyer From who dated whom on set to who married someone with the same name as them, we found out everything there is to know about the angst teens' current relationships. But don\u2019t let their shine and sparkly fool you; getting there was a tough road for some. Keep scrolling to learn more.\n\nKristen Stewart\n\nKristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in 2011\n\nIan Gavan / Stringer/Getty\n\nWhile filming Twilight, Kristen Stewart famously dated her on-screen love interest Robert Pattinson. The couple confirmed their relationship in 2010, but the rumors of their romance began a year earlier. It only took two years before their first controversy ensued.\n\nIn July 2012, Stewart was caught kissing Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders. She then apologized, saying, \u201cI'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry.\u201d\n\nA year later, in May 2013, the couple split and accredited Stewart\u2019s infidelity as the reason why, causing Twilight fans all around the world to weep.\n\nLater, in 2016, Stewart opened up about her relationship with Pattinson, saying, \u201cPeople wanted me and Rob to be together so badly that our relationship was made into a product.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t real life anymore. And that was gross to me. It\u2019s not that I want to hide who I am or hide anything I\u2019m doing in my life. It\u2019s that I don\u2019t want to become a part of a story for entertainment value.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two remain friends to this day, and Stewart even attended Pattinson\u2019s birthday in 2023.\n\nFollowing her split with her former co-star, Stewart came out as queer in 2017 and has gone on to date several different women. Most recently, she has been romantically linked to screenwriter Dylan Meyer. The two have been together since 2019.\n\nKristen Stewart and Dylan Meyer in 2024\n\nStefanie Keenan / Contributor/Getty\n\n\u201cThe first time I told her I loved her, it was like really late, and we were in some like s----- bar,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cAnd her friends were there or whatever, and they walked out, and I was just, like, 'Oh, man, I'm so f------ in love with you.' Like, done. It wasn't, like, 'a thing,' and it also was, like, so obvious.\"\n\nThe pair are still together today and often walk red carpets together.\n\nRobert Pattinson\n\nRobert Pattinson and FKA Twigs in 2017\n\nBEN STANSALL / Staff/Getty\n\nAfter ending things with Stewart, Pattinson dated singer FKA Twigs in 2014. The pair met through their mutual friend, Florence Welch, and dated for three years, but split due to travel issues. There were also rumors that Pattison cheated.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two have remained rather close-lipped about their love affair, but in 2022 Twigs said that she was bullied during their relationship.\n\n\u201cHe was their white Prince Charming, and I think they considered that he should definitely be with somebody white and blonde and ... not me,\u201d she said. \"Say if I was wearing a red dress, they would have a [photo of a] monkey in a red dress, or if I was on a bike, they'd find a monkey on a bike.\"\n\n\"I just remember it had this massive, dysmorphic effect on me for about six months to a year, where every time I saw my pictures, in photographs, I would think, 'Gosh, I look like a monkey, and people are gonna say that I look like a monkey, so I need to really try and hide this monkey-ness that I have.\u201d\n\nFollowing his split with Twigs, Pattinson began a love affair with actress and singer Suki Waterhouse. They met in 2018, made their red carpet debut in 2022, got engaged in 2023 and welcomed their first child in 2024.\n\nRobert Pattinson and Suki Waterhouse in 2024\n\nMonica Schipper / Staff/Getty\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think Rob\u2019s quite funny,\" Waterhouse said in a rare public comment regarding her partner. \"I light up when I\u2019m around him.\u201d\n\nPattinson and Waterhouse are still together to this day, and they\u2019re often seen on the red carpet at events.\n\nTaylor Lautner\n\nTaylor Lautner and Taylor Lautner in 2024\n\nKevin Winter / Staff/Getty\n\nTaylor Lautner has been in several high-profile relationships throughout his career, most notably with actress Billie Lourd, actress Marie Avgeropoulos and even singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. Sadly, none of them worked out, though, and instead, Lautner married registered nurse Taylor Dome. The two started dating after Lautner\u2019s sister introduced them in 2018, got engaged in 2021 and then tied the knot in November the next year.\n\nDome changed her last name following the wedding, making both parties \u201cTaylor Lautner.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cPackages are becoming tough. We need to figure something out because when I'm buying stuff for her, and she's buying stuff for me, we're going to have some surprises spoiled if we open the wrong Taylor Lautner package,\" the Twilight star joked.\n\n\"TSA ... they'll be, like, 'Which one of you is Taylor Lautner?' And we're, like, 'Both of us.' They're, like, \u2018Meh, this seems fishy. We're gonna send you to security.\u2019\"\n\nSo far, it seems like the name thing hasn\u2019t been a problem and the two remain happily married to this day. They often post about their outings on social media and even co-host a podcast together called The Squeeze with Taylor Lautner & Taylor Lautner. They also got matching tattoos together.\n\nAshley Greene\n\nAshley Greene and Paul Khoury in 2024\n\nUnique Nicole / Stringer/Getty\n\nAlice might have been able to see the future, but we don\u2019t think even she would have been able to see how happy actress Ashley Greene would be with her future husband, Paul Khoury. The two got married in 2018 and welcomed their first child in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cFive years ago I married my best friend... 5 years later, you still give me giggles and butterflies,\u201d Greene wrote in 2023. \u201c I knew I loved you then, but I could never understand how much I would love you now. Life with you is the greatest adventure.\u201d\n\nGreene and Khoury are still together and often post glowing love letters to each other on social media.\n\nJackson Rathbone\n\nJackson Rathbone and Sheila Hafsadi in 2017\n\nLily Lawrence / Stringer/Getty\n\nJasper and Alice might not have ended up together, but actor Jackson Rathbone did end up happily married to Sheila Hafsadi. They have been married since 2020 after welcoming their son together in 2019.\n\n\u201cWe are both spontaneous people. I wouldn\u2019t say we are bohemian, but we are both artistic,\u201d Rathbone said. \u201cIt was one of those things. I always said I believed in love at first sight, but I never really had that feeling before.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRathbone and Hafsadi are still together as of now, but remain rather quiet on social media.\n\nNikki Reed\n\nIt turns out Nikki Reed just couldn\u2019t leave the world of brooding vampires behind because, in 2015, she married fellow teen heartthrob Ian Somerhalder.\n\nBefore that, though, she married Paul McDonald in 2011 and remained with him until 2015. The details around their relationship and split remain unclear.\n\nNikki Reed and Paul McDonald in 2014\n\nTaylor Hill / Contributor/Getty\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter that, though, Reed moved on to Somerhalder and has been with him ever since. They have since welcomed three kids together.\n\nNikki Reed and Ian Somerhalder in 2024\n\nGreg Doherty / Stringer/Getty\n\n\u201cWe live such crazy nomadic lifestyles all over the place, on planes, and [we've had] to uproot and move,\u201d Reed said in 2018. \"Now that we're a family, the whole family goes together so that Mom and Dad can both be there at every second to witness every milestone and everything that's happening.\"\n\n\"It's kind of like you pick up the whole house and move it and set the house down. We definitely are feeling right now like we miss home.\"\n\nReed and Somerhalder are still happily married and often post about each other on their respective socials.\n\nKellan Lutz\n\nKellan Lutz and Brittany Lutz in 2019\n\nJesse Grant / Stringer/Getty\n\nIn 2017, actor Kellan Lutz married Brittany Lutz. They have since welcomed two kids together.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a good dad,\u201d Brittany wrote on Instagram in September 2024. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to his kids is important to him.\u201d\n\nThe couple is still going strong, and while they don\u2019t do a lot of interviews, they do post together on social media.\n\nFor more real life couples, keep scrolling!\n\nDrama, Romance and Real Love: The \u2018Beverly Hills, 90210\u2019 Cast\u2019s Real-Life Relationships Revealed!\n\n\u2018Will and Grace\u2019 Cast: Real-Life Couples, Romances, and Marriages Revealed!\n\nInside the Real-Life Relationships of \u2018The King of Queens\u2019 Cast: Love Stories and Heartbreak"

            "article_content": "Scientists have demonstrated that atoms can exhibit wave-like behavior, challenging long-held assumptions that experiments of this nature were impossible and opening new doors in quantum physics. The experiment uses atoms and a one-atom-thick graphene sheet to recreate a classic quantum phenomenon: Particle diffraction.\n\nThis research could pave the way for revolutionary technologies, including highly sensitive gravitational wave detectors. The story begins several decades ago, in 1927, when physicist George Paget Thomson revealed that electrons, when passed through a crystal grating, produce a diffraction pattern\u2014a hallmark of wave-like behavior.\n\nThomson\u2019s discovery not only earned him a Nobel Prize but also fueled advancements such as the electron microscope. For nearly a century, scientists have sought to replicate this diffraction effect in an impossible experiment with atoms. However, traditional methods required specially engineered gratings with relatively large gaps, limiting the sensitivity of the resulting patterns.\n\nImage source: aapsky / Adobe\n\nThe crux of the issue was that using a crystal grating for atoms was deemed impossible because high-energy atoms, necessary for the process, were expected to damage the crystal. However, researchers at the German Aerospace Center have now achieved the seemingly impossible.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Remarkably, after 100 hours of exposure, the graphene showed no damage, and a distinct circular diffraction pattern was recorded. This experiment marks the first successful demonstration of atomic diffraction through a crystal grating.\n\nThe secret lies in the energy dynamics of the atoms. By exchanging energy with graphene atoms undetectably, the atoms retained their quantum wave properties. Bill Allison from the University of Cambridge explains this phenomenon with a vivid analogy: it\u2019s like opening and closing a door silently in a crowded room\u2014no one knows which door was used, preserving the wave-like behavior.\n\nThe implications are profound. This discovery could lead to the development of atomic interferometers with unmatched sensitivity, potentially detecting gravitational waves beyond the capability of current technology. Scientists are optimistic about the potential applications of atomic diffraction, hailing the experiment as a bold leap forward in quantum research.\n\nThis achievement not only redefines what\u2019s possible in quantum mechanics but also highlights the ever-evolving nature of science, where seemingly insurmountable challenges inspire innovations that shape the future."

            "article_content": "Back in May, OpenAI said it was developing a tool to let creators specify how they want their works to be included in \u2014 or excluded from \u2014 its AI training data. But seven months later, this feature has yet to see the light of day.\n\nCalled Media Manager, the tool would \u201cidentify copyrighted text, images, audio, and video,\u201d OpenAI said at the time, to reflect creators\u2019 preferences \u201cacross multiple sources.\u201d It was intended to stave off some of the company\u2019s fiercest critics, and potentially shield OpenAI from IP-related legal challenges.\n\nBut people familiar tell TechCrunch that the tool was rarely viewed as an important launch internally. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a priority,\u201d one former OpenAI employee said. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember anyone working on it.\u201d\n\nA non-employee who coordinates work with the company told TechCrunch in December that they had discussed the tool with OpenAI in the past, but that there haven\u2019t been any recent updates. (These people declined to be publicly identified discussing confidential business matters.)\n\nAnd a member of OpenAI\u2019s legal team who was working on Media Manager, Fred von Lohmann, transitioned to a part-time consultant role in October. OpenAI PR confirmed Von Lohmann\u2019s move to TechCrunch via email.\n\nOpenAI has yet to give an update on Media Manager\u2019s progress, and the company missed a self-imposed deadline to have the tool in place \u201cby 2025.\u201d (To be clear, \u201cby 2025\u201d could be read as inclusive of the year 2025, but TechCrunch interpreted OpenAI\u2019s language to mean leading up to January 1, 2025.)\n\nIP issues\n\nAI models like OpenAI\u2019s learn patterns in sets of data to make predictions \u2014 for instance, that a person biting into a burger will leave a bite mark. This allows models to learn how the world works, to a degree, by observing it. ChatGPT can write convincing emails and essays, while Sora, OpenAI\u2019s video generator, can create relatively realistic footage.\n\nThe ability to draw on examples of writing, film, and more to generate new works makes AI incredibly powerful. But it\u2019s also regurgitative. When prompted in a certain way, models \u2014 most of which are trained on countless web pages, videos, and images \u2014 produce near-copies of that data, which despite being \u201cpublicly available,\u201d are not meant to be used this way.\n\nFor example, Sora can generate clips featuring TikTok\u2019s logo and popular video game characters. The New York Times has gotten ChatGPT to quote its articles verbatim (OpenAI blamed the behavior on a \u201chack\u201c).\n\nThis has understandably upset creators whose works have been swept up in AI training without their permission. Many have lawyered up.\n\nOpenAI is fighting class action lawsuits filed by artists, writers, YouTubers, computer scientists, and news organizations, all of whom claim the startup trained on their works illegally. Plaintiffs include authors Sarah Silverman and Ta Nehisi-Coates, visual artists, and media conglomerates like The New York Times and Radio-Canada, to name a few.\n\nOpenAI has pursued licensing deals with select partners, but not all creators see the terms as attractive.\n\nManaging media\n\nOpenAI offers creators several ad hoc ways to \u201copt out\u201d of its AI training. Last September, the company launched a submission form to allow artists to flag their work for removal from its future training sets. And OpenAI has long let webmasters block its web-crawling bots from scraping data across their domains.\n\nBut creators have criticized these methods as haphazard and inadequate. There aren\u2019t specific opt-out mechanisms for written works, videos, or audio recordings. And the opt-out form for images requires submitting a copy of each image to be removed along with a description, an onerous process.\n\nMedia Manager was pitched as a complete revamp \u2014 and expansion \u2014 of OpenAI\u2019s opt-out solutions today.\n\nIn the announcement post in May, OpenAI said that Media Manager would use \u201ccutting-edge machine learning research\u201d to enable creators and content owners to \u201ctell [OpenAI] what they own.\u201d OpenAI, which claimed it was collaborating with regulators as it developed the tool, said that it hoped Media Manager would \u201cset a standard across the AI industry.\u201d\n\nOpenAI has never publicly mentioned Media Manager since.\n\nA spokesperson told TechCrunch that the tool was \u201cstill in development\u201d as of August, but didn\u2019t respond to a follow-up request for comment in mid-December.\n\nOpenAI has given no indication as to when Media Manager might launch \u2014 or even which features and capabilities it might launch with.\n\nFair use\n\nAssuming Media Manager does arrive at some point, experts aren\u2019t convinced that it will allay creators\u2019 concerns \u2014 or do much to resolve the legal questions surrounding AI and IP usage.\n\nAdrian Cyhan, an IP attorney at Stubbs Alderton & Markiles, noted that Media Manager as described is an ambitious undertaking. Even platforms as large as YouTube and TikTok struggle with content ID at scale. Could OpenAI really do better?\n\n\u201cEnsuring compliance with legally required creator protections and potential compensation requirements under consideration presents challenges,\u201d Cyhan told TechCrunch, \u201cespecially given the rapidly-evolving and potentially divergent legal landscape across national and local jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nEd Newton-Rex, the founder of Fairly Trained, a nonprofit that certifies AI companies are respecting creators\u2019 rights, believes that Media Manager would unfairly shift the burden of controlling AI training onto creators; by not using it, they arguably could be giving tacit approval for their works to be used. \u201cMost creators will never even hear about it, let alone use it,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cBut it will nevertheless be used to defend the mass exploitation of creative work against creators\u2019 wishes.\u201d\n\nMike Borella, co-chair of MBHB\u2019s AI practice group, pointed out that opt-out systems don\u2019t always account for transformations that might be made to a work, like an image that\u2019s been downsampled. They also might not address the all-to-common scenario of third-party platforms hosting copies of creators\u2019 content, added Joshua Weigensberg, an IP and media lawyer for Pryor Cashman.\n\n\u201cCreators and copyright owners do not control, and often do not even know, where their works appear on the internet,\u201d Weigensberg said. \u201cEven if a creator tells every single AI platform that they are opting out of training, those companies may well still go ahead and train on copies of their works available on third-party websites and services.\u201d\n\nMedia Manager might not even be especially advantageous for OpenAI, at least from a jurisprudential standpoint. Evan Everist, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney specializing in copyright law, said that while OpenAI could use the tool to show a judge it\u2019s mitigating its training on IP-protected content, Media Manager likely wouldn\u2019t shield the company from damages if it was found to have infringed.\n\n\u201cCopyright owners do not have an obligation to go out and preemptively tell others not to infringe their works before that infringement occurs,\u201d Everist said. \u201cThe basics of copyright law still apply \u2014 i.e., don\u2019t take and copy other people\u2019s stuff without permission. This feature may be more about PR and positioning OpenAI as an ethical user of content.\u201d\n\nA reckoning\n\nIn the absence of Media Manager, OpenAI has implemented filters \u2014 albeit imperfect ones \u2014 to prevent its models from regurgitating training examples. And in the lawsuits it\u2019s battling, the company continues to claim fair use protections, asserting that its models create transformative, not plagiaristic, works.\n\nOpenAI could well prevail in its copyright disputes.\n\nThe courts may decide that the company\u2019s AI has a \u201ctransformative purpose,\u201d following the precedent set roughly a decade ago in the publishing industry\u2019s suit against Google. In that case, a court held that Google\u2019s copying of millions of books for Google Books, a sort of digital archive, was permissible.\n\nOpenAI has said publicly that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to train competitive AI models without using copyrighted materials \u2014 authorized or no. \u201cLimiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today\u2019s citizens,\u201d the company wrote in a January submission to the U.K.\u2019s House of Lords.\n\nShould courts eventually declare OpenAI victorious, Media Manager wouldn\u2019t serve much of a legal purpose. OpenAI seems to be willing to make that bet \u2014 or to reconsider its opt-out strategy.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter! Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday."

Much of the work needed to get the most out of these off-the-shelf tools requires prompt engineering, or crafting the prompts used to structure responses.\n\nHowever, there are limits to prompt engineering. You need to deliver the same prompt every time, along with user requests and all their associated data. This can be a significant issue if you\u2019re pushing the maximum size of a model\u2019s context window, and it can cost you more each time, as services like Azure OpenAI are paid for on a per-token basis. At the same time, complex requests can add latency to operations.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is a way to focus the underlying model and tune it to work with your data. This is where Azure AI Foundry comes in. Azure AI Foundry offers a framework that helps you fine-tune big, complex models with Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA). By using this technique to adjust model parameters, when you run AI inference workloads, higher quality results can be delivered using fewer tokens, with less risk of prompt overruns and other issues that can cause incorrect or incoherent results."

            "article_content": "OpenAI\u2019s latest AI model, dubbed simply as GPT o3, has generated considerable buzz in the tech community over the past week or so. Announced near the end of 2024, OpenAI o3 represents a major leap forward in advanced reasoning, coding, and scientific problem-solving.\n\nAlso read: OpenAI in 2024: ChatGPT Search, Sora AI video, and all the big wins\n\nWhy OpenAI went with o3 as the name for its next version of ChatGPT, skipping o2 after o1 (which is the current latest ChatGPT version) has raised a lot of eyebrows. Despite all of that, here are five key takeaways to help you understand what makes OpenAI o3 so significant and how it could set the early benchmark for the AI industry\u2019s trajectory going into 2025.\n\n1) ChatGPT o3 model cracks PhD tests\n\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of o3 is its robust performance on multiple benchmarks that gauge real-world problem-solving ability. On math tests like the AIME 2024, o3 scored a remarkable 96.7%, surpassing the already-impressive 83.3% achieved by its predecessor, O1. In science, it excelled on PhD-level benchmarks such as the GPQA Diamond test, outscoring O1 by nearly 10 percentage points.\n\nBut the most eye-opening results came from the ARC AGI benchmark \u2013 an assessment specifically designed to measure adaptability and \u201cgeneral intelligence.\u201d Putting a smile on OpenAI\u2019s face, o3 reached 75.7% in standard-compute settings and an even higher 87.5% under high-compute conditions, dwarfing previous records like Claude 3.5\u2019s 53% score. This achievement suggests ChatGPT o3 can handle novel tasks more creatively than earlier large language models, pointing to a significant step toward more generalised AI.\n\n2) Advanced reasoning improved in OpenAI o3 model\n\nA key innovation behind ChatGPT o3\u2019s success is something OpenAI calls \u201cprogram synthesis.\u201d The model doesn\u2019t just retrieve knowledge from its training data, but also reconfigures that knowledge into new patterns and algorithms. This enables o3 to solve tasks it has never directly encountered, such as intricate logic puzzles or advanced coding challenges.\n\nAlso read: How to use ChatGPT on WhatsApp in 3 easy steps\n\nSimilarly, building on traditional \u201cchains of thought\u201d (CoT) reasoning, OpenAI o3 dynamically explores multiple solution paths in natural language \u2013 much like brainstorming different approaches. It then evaluates these paths using what the reports call an \u201cevaluator model,\u201d effectively acting as its own judge. By iteratively refining and testing different solution candidates, o3 mirrors a more human-like problem-solving process.\n\n3) Public safety training baked into ChatGPT o3 model\n\nAs AI systems grow increasingly complex, safety considerations take centre stage. Addressing calls for enhanced safety, OpenAI highlights a novel paradigm called \u201cdeliberative alignment,\u201d wherein the AI explicitly learns human-written safety guidelines and reasons about these specifications before generating its responses. This ensures it interprets ethical and safety constraints in a transparent, step-by-step manner.\n\nMoreover, OpenAI is inviting external safety researchers to vet ChatGPT o3\u2019s behavior before it rolls out widely for all subscribers. A form on the OpenAI website allows experts to request early access, and this public safety testing runs until January 10. Such transparency, along with real-time reasoning checks, aims to prevent misuse and mitigate unintended consequences.\n\n4) OpenAI o3 \u2013 mini AGI model?\n\nDiscussions around ChatGPT o3 often circle back to the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2013 an AI system that can handle virtually any intellectual task a human can. While OpenAI and industry experts emphasise that ChatGPT o3 does not constitute full AGI, it makes notable strides in \u201creasoning beyond training data.\u201d From generating state-of-the-art results on ARC \u2013 a benchmark widely regarded as a measure of adaptive intelligence \u2013 to performing at \u201cGrandmaster\u201d levels in coding competitions, o3 signals that AI is inching closer to tackling unfamiliar challenges with minimal human guidance.\n\nAlso read: ChatGPT Projects explained: OpenAI\u2019s new customisation feature\n\nYet, the reports also acknowledge that these leaps come at a cost. Pushing AI to the bleeding edge requires significant compute resources, meticulous data labeling, and constant oversight to ensure reliability across diverse real-world contexts. If OpenAI o3\u2019s methods prove scalable, the industry could see a major shift toward hybrid approaches combining deep learning with structured problem-solving techniques. However, as experts like Fran\u00e7ois Chollet caution, this journey will involve balancing innovation against potential pitfalls like bias, misuse, and computational bottlenecks.\n\nOverall, it must be said that OpenAI\u2019s o3 represents a bold statement about where large-scale AI models are headed. By surpassing previous benchmarks in math, coding, and generalized intelligence, it demonstrates just how rapidly AI can evolve.\n\nAlso read: What does the evolution of AI so far tell us about its future?"

            "article_content": "An app's performance is key to make users want to use it, say Meta engineers Dave LaMacchia and Jason Patterson. This includes making the app lightning-fast, battery-efficient, and reliable across a range of devices and connectivity conditions.\n\nTo improve Threads performance, Meta engineers measured how fast the app launches, how easy it is to post a photo or video, how often it crashes, and how many bug reports people filed. To this aim, they defined a number of metrics: frustrating image-render experience (FIRE), time-to-network content (TTNC), and creation-publish success rate (cPSR).\n\nFIRE is the percentage of people who experience a frustrating image-render experience, which may lead to them leaving the app while the image is rendering across the network. Roughly, FIRE is defined as the quotient of the number of users leaving the app before an image is fully rendered by the sum of all users attempting to display that image. Measuring this metric allows Threads developers to detect any regressions in how images are loading for users.\n\nTime-to-network content (TTNC) is roughly the time required for the app to launch and display the user's feed. Long loading time is another experience killer that may lead users to abandon the app. Reducing the app's binary size is paramount to keeping the binary small:\n\nEvery time someone tries to commit code to Threads, they\u2019re alerted if that code change would increase our app\u2019s binary size above a configured threshold.\n\nAdditionally, they removed unnecessary code and graphics assets from the app bundle, resulting in a binary one-quarter the size of Instagram.\n\nAs to navigation latency, this is possibly even more critical than launch time. Meta engineers carried through A/B tests to find out that:\n\nWith the smallest latency injection, the impact was small or negligible for some views, but the largest injections had negative effects across the board. People would read fewer posts, post less often themselves, and in general interact less with the app.\n\nTo ensure that no changes cause a regression in navigation latency, Meta engineers created SLATE, a logger system that tracks relevant events like triggers of a new navigation, the UI being built, activity spinners, and content from the network or an error being displayed.\n\nIt\u2019s implemented using a set of common components that are the foundation for a lot of our UI and a system that measures performance by setting \u201cmarkers\u201d in code for specific events. Typically these markers are created with a specific purpose in mind.\n\nCreation-publish success rate (cPSR) measures how likely it is for an user to successfully complete the process of posting some content. On iOS, posting a video or large photo is especially tricky, since the user could background the app after posting their content without waiting for the upload to complete, in which case the app may be terminated by the OS.\n\nHere, the approach taken by Meta was aimed at improving the user experience in those cases when posting failed. This was accomplished by introducing a new feature, called Drafts, to allow users to manage failed posts in more flexible ways instead of just providing the option to retry or abort the operation.\n\nWe discovered that 26 percent fewer people submitted bug reports about posting if they had Drafts. The feature was clearly making a difference.\n\nAnother approach was trying to reduce perceived latency, as opposed to absolute latency, showing a request has been received when the data upload completes but before it\u2019s been processed and published.\n\nLast but not least, Meta engineers saw a great improvement in app stability after they adopted Swift's complete concurrency, which, they say, does a great job at preventing data races and reducing hard-to-debug problems caused by data races."

The experiment uses atoms and a one-atom-thick graphene sheet to recreate a classic quantum phenomenon: Particle diffraction.\n\nThis research could pave the way for revolutionary technologies, including highly sensitive gravitational wave detectors. The story begins several decades ago, in 1927, when physicist George Paget Thomson revealed that electrons, when passed through a crystal grating, produce a diffraction pattern\u2014a hallmark of wave-like behavior.\n\nThomson\u2019s discovery not only earned him a Nobel Prize but also fueled advancements such as the electron microscope. For nearly a century, scientists have sought to replicate this diffraction effect in an impossible experiment with atoms. However, traditional methods required specially engineered gratings with relatively large gaps, limiting the sensitivity of the resulting patterns.\n\nImage source: aapsky / Adobe\n\nThe crux of the issue was that using a crystal grating for atoms was deemed impossible because high-energy atoms, necessary for the process, were expected to damage the crystal. However, researchers at the German Aerospace Center have now achieved the seemingly impossible.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.

Remarkably, after 100 hours of exposure, the graphene showed no damage, and a distinct circular diffraction pattern was recorded. This experiment marks the first successful demonstration of atomic diffraction through a crystal grating.\n\nThe secret lies in the energy dynamics of the atoms. By exchanging energy with graphene atoms undetectably, the atoms retained their quantum wave properties. Bill Allison from the University of Cambridge explains this phenomenon with a vivid analogy: it\u2019s like opening and closing a door silently in a crowded room\u2014no one knows which door was used, preserving the wave-like behavior.\n\nThe implications are profound. This discovery could lead to the development of atomic interferometers with unmatched sensitivity, potentially detecting gravitational waves beyond the capability of current technology. Scientists are optimistic about the potential applications of atomic diffraction, hailing the experiment as a bold leap forward in quantum research.\n\nThis achievement not only redefines what\u2019s possible in quantum mechanics but also highlights the ever-evolving nature of science, where seemingly insurmountable challenges inspire innovations that shape the future."

            "article_content": "Among the important scientific discoveries made every year are some that reveal that the world is way weirder than we give it credit for. From bizarre biological quirks that cause demonic hallucinations, to sci-fi scenarios like brains piloting robots and full head transplants, here are the weirdest science stories of 2024.\n\nChip for brains\n\nHuman brain organoids wired into computer chips can now learn to drive robots thanks to a new biocomputing interface. Note: the images above are purely for demonstration, but the technology is legit Tianjin University\n\nNothing says \u201cmad scientist\u201d like sticking a human brain into a robot body \u2013 and that\u2019s precisely what Chinese scientists plan to do in the near future.\n\nIt\u2019s called the MetaBOC project, where \u201cBOC\u201d stands for \u201cbrain-on-chip.\u201d It\u2019s exactly what it sounds like: wads of brain cells are grown in the lab and wired into electronic chips, then trained to perform certain tasks though electrical signals. According to the team, they\u2019re essentially ready to learn to drive humanoid robot bodies through trial and error, first through simulations and then real-world tests.\n\nMaybe we\u2019ll see the results of these experiments pop up on our list of weirdest science stories of 2025.\n\nFace your demons\n\nThe faces on the right are computer-manipulated versions of those on the left, verified by the PMO patient that that's how he sees faces in real life A. Mello et al.\n\nImagine waking up one morning and finding that the face of everyone you see is demonically distorted, with pointy ears, stretched eyes and a terrifying grin. You might just have a rare neurological condition called prosopometamorphopsia (PMO), and this year a unique case study gave us a glimpse at what those hallucinations look like.\n\nOnly about 75 cases have ever been described, and it\u2019s hard to visualize exactly what these patients see, because when you show them a picture they\u2019ll also see that face distorted. But one patient has a strange variation on the condition, where real-world faces appear demonic but those on screens look fine.\n\nSo researchers at Dartmouth used this to build a kind of police sketch. The patient described the face of a person sitting in front of him, and the researchers digitally edited photos of them until the patient confirmed that they resembled the distorted face before him.\n\nThe results, as you can see above, are super creepy, especially considering the condition can appear overnight and last a lifetime.\n\nBar flies\n\nSocial drinking produces a euphoria that's not seen with drinking alone Depositphotos\n\nIn a report from August, scientists got fruit flies drunk. It wasn\u2019t just for laughs though \u2013 the team was investigating the neurological differences between social and solo drinking.\n\nThe scientists exposed flies to ethanol vapor either in a group or alone, and then studied their behavior and brain activity. Sure enough, intoxicated flies at the party became far more hyperactive and enjoyed larger dopamine spikes in their brains, compared to the lonely flies listening in from the next room over.\n\nThe study revealed the mechanism behind why getting on the sauce with friends gives you a pleasant buzz, but drinking alone is just a bit sad.\n\nI want to believe\n\nA still of an unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) from a video recorded by US Navy fighter jets in 2015 United States Navy\n\n2024 was the year the Scullys of the world took over from the Mulders in studying UFOs \u2013 or Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), as they\u2019ve been rebranded. The latest annual report from the US Department of Defense outlined 757 new incidents of strange sights in the sky.\n\nWhile many cases were closed due to being traced to mundane explanations, and most don\u2019t have enough data to reach a conclusion, 21 tantalizing cases remain with \u201canomalous characteristics and/or behaviors\u201d that warrant further analysis, including a close shave with a commercial airliner.\n\nIn another study, scientists at the University of Utah investigated the geography of about 98,000 reported sightings to see where they clustered. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people were more likely to see UAPs in places where they had clearer views of the sky, and were close to places with lots of aircraft.\n\nDon\u2019t get your hopes up for aliens though: the reports say there\u2019s still no evidence. But it\u2019s clear that something is going on anyway.\n\nLoudmouth Billy Bass\n\nScientists have identified a tiny fish with a \"voice\" as loud as a jet engine Image generated by DALL-E\n\nFish aren\u2019t normally known for being noisy, but you\u2019ve never met this unassuming little minnow. Although it\u2019s only half an inch long, Danionella cerebrum makes itself known with a booming voice of 140 decibels.\n\nIn February 2024, scientists figured out that it does so with the help of a sound-producing apparatus unlike any others known in nature. The fish slaps a piece of \u201cdrumming cartilage\u201d against its swim bladder with a force of over 2,000 g, using a series of muscle contractions to make different calls.\n\nWhy exactly does it need a voice like a jet engine? The team suggests it\u2019s because they live in murky waters, so communication requires the most extreme game of Marco Polo ever.\n\nGiving head\n\nRobots could be surgically swapping heads within the decade BrainBridge\n\nIs your body racked with cancer, or paralyzed from a spinal cord injury? Why not just cut your head off and slap it onto a brand new body? That\u2019s the idea behind BrainBridge, the brainchild of Berlin-based \"producer, filmmaker and science communicator\" Hashem Al-Ghaili.\n\nThat list of titles should be enough to tell you that this is mostly an evocative extrapolation of what might eventually be possible as technology advances. Basically it\u2019s a bit of speculative sci-fi, like a low-budget version of The Matrix.\n\nIn Al-Ghaili\u2019s vision, patients whose bodies are a complete write-off can jump in a head transplant machine, where an octopus of robot arms driven by advanced AI will sever the muscles, blood vessels, nerves and spinal cord, and stitch it all back together onto a new donor body.\n\nIt sounds nuts, but Al-Ghaili is apparently serious about it: he\u2019s laid out an eight-year roadmap to the first surgery, starting with spinal cord repairs for practice. We\u2019ve got a \u201ctold you so\u201d locked and loaded for 2032.\n\nLight itself casts shadow\n\nA diagram illustrating how the experimental setup worked R. A. Abrahao, H. P. N. Morin, J. T. R. Pag\u00e9, A. Safari, R. W. Boyd, J. S. Lundeen\n\nCan light itself cast a shadow? Officially, no \u2013 Photons pass right through each other. But the paradox inspired scientists at Brookhaven National Lab to try to design an experiment where it could.\n\nAnd they did! Kinda. They shone a green \u201cobject\u201d laser in one direction and lit it up from the side with a wider blue \u201cillumination\u201d laser beam, and found that yes, they could see the shadow of the green laser on a surface.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch of course. The green laser was passing through a cube of ruby, where it created quasiparticles called polaritons. Technically, those polaritons are casting the shadow, but they\u2019re half made of photons, so maybe it still counts?\n\nActual applications aren\u2019t clear, but the experiment is a testament to that engineering spirit of finding a way to do what sounds impossible.\n\nMajor mergers\n\nA pair of comb jellies have fused together into one organism, demonstrating a bizarre new ability Mariana Rodriguez-Santiago\n\nWhen businesses need a hand, mergers are a common tactic \u2013 and this year it was discovered that life does the same thing. Back in April, scientists at Berkeley Lab found that an algae and a bacterium have merged to do something neither of them can alone: grab nitrogen, a key nutrient, from the air around them.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate what a massive evolutionary milestone this is. This is only the third time it\u2019s ever happened in the several-billion-year history of life on Earth, and last time it did we got plants.\n\nOkay, it didn\u2019t exactly happen in 2024 \u2013 that was just when we noticed it. Apparently the process started about 100 million years ago, which sounds like ages but is relatively recent on the grand scale of things.\n\nIn another study published in October, another eerie instance of biological mergers was accidentally discovered. Comb jellies in a tank were found to be able to fuse together to survive after a major injury, sometimes overnight. The combo comb jellies shared their nervous and digestive systems \u2013 but kept their own buttholes.\n\nBrains behaving badly\n\nWhen the reward for achieving a task is high, neurons in our motor cortex misfire Depositphotos\n\nOur brains don\u2019t always do what we want them to, and two studies in 2024 revealed the lengths they\u2019ll go to.\n\nAt some point in your life you\u2019ve probably fumbled at the worst possible time. In September scientists identified the neurons you can blame for getting a gutter ball one strike short of a perfect game.\n\nNeurons in the motor cortex were found to misfire when the stakes are highest, causing Rhesus monkeys (and by extension humans) to mess up a well-trained action when the reward jackpots.\n\nFrustratingly, the only advice the scientists have for not choking under pressure is to stay calm and loose, which is easier said than done.\n\nIn a separate study, scientists found that our brains aren\u2019t completely awake and asleep when we think they are. Bits of our brain are taking micro-naps throughout the day, and when we\u2019re trying to sleep they jolt awake randomly.\n\nMouse studies also suggested that these moments of defiance can be seen as physical responses: mice zoned out for a split-second while their brains rebooted, and twitched in their sleep when those regions woke up briefly.\n\nTrees v1\n\nAn artist's impression of a forest full of Calamophyton trees Peter Giesen/Chris Berry\n\nAbout 390 million years ago, pioneering animals crawling out of the oceans would have been greeted by the first forests \u2013 and they would have looked completely alien to us. This year UK paleontologists described strange \u2018prototype\u2019 trees from a time before evolution figured out the age-old adage of \u201cKeep It Simple, Stupid.\u201d\n\nKnown as Calamophyton, these rough draft trees sported knobbly trunks topped with pom-pom tufts that dropped branches constantly. Those trunks were actually hollow, ringed by a series of mini-trees that each absorbed water from the soil.\n\nWeirdest of all is the self-destructive way these trees grew. As researcher Chris Berry put it, \u201cthe tree simultaneously ripped its skeleton apart and collapsed under its own weight while staying alive and growing upwards and outwards \u2026 There is no other tree that I know of in the history of the Earth that has ever done anything as complicated as this.\u201d"

            "article_content": "It's been a topsy-turvy year for Super Micro Computer (SMCI -1.41%). Once seen as the next big artificial intelligence (AI) stock, it has come crashing down to reality in recent months due to concerns about the reliability of its numbers and accounting controls.\n\nHowever, after hitting a low of $17.25 on Nov. 15 on concerns that it could get delisted from the Nasdaq exchange, the stock has rallied heavily, and recently traded at about $30. With a new auditor in place and a plan to file its financials (which are late) by February, investors appear to be much more at ease with the stock these days.\n\nBut while you might be tempted to buy into the rally, there's still significant risk here, and multiple reasons the stock could be due for a big pullback in 2025.\n\nIs Super Micro's growth rate starting to slow down?\n\nWhen it comes to AI stocks, the name of the game is growth. Super Micro has experienced significant demand for its servers and storage products as companies race to develop AI models.\n\nSince the company is still transitioning to a new auditor, it hasn't posted a full set of quarterly numbers since August. In November, however, the company did release preliminary results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30). What was a bit concerning is that Super Micro projects net sales to be within a range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion. That's considerably lower than its previous estimate, which projected sales of between $6 billion and $7 billion. These aren't final numbers, but it looks like a significant miss, and it raises questions about whether the business is seeing a slowdown in demand.\n\nEven if Super Micro does release its financials in a timely fashion, that doesn't mean that the results will necessarily be great or what investors will want to see. While $6 billion in sales would still represent an incredible increase of 183% year over year, the problem is that Super Micro's gross margins still remain incredibly low.\n\nGreater controls and procedures could squeeze Super Micro's thin profit margins\n\nTo alleviate concerns about accounting controls and procedures, it seems inevitable that Super Micro may need to hire more staff and spend money on implementing additional protocols to help maintain the accuracy and integrity of its financials.\n\nThat additional overhead could mean that Super Micro's profit margins will become even narrower. The tighter those margins are, the less benefit the company gets from any incremental dollar of revenue. In its preliminary numbers for Q1, Super Micro's gross margin was just 13.3%. While that's technically an improvement from the 11.2% it reported a quarter earlier, that's still dreadfully low -- and gross margin comes before overhead and other indirect expenses. The company's actual profit margin will be even narrower.\n\nThis will be the key metric that investors will want to focus on when Super Micro finally reports its full quarterly results -- what its profit margin looks like after factoring in all the changes it has made. If margins deteriorate significantly, that could quickly cripple the stock. The seemingly cheap 9 times forward earnings that it trades at today could be due for an adjustment, as analysts will likely update their future earnings expectations for the stock.\n\nSuper Micro's stock is a gamble right now\n\nThere are so many unknowns surrounding Super Micro today that it can be next to impossible to predict how it might perform in 2025. If it releases its annual report and quarterly filings as planned, and its numbers still look great, then it could certainly take off. But if it doesn't, or if it releases the numbers but its growth rate or its bottom line don't look as good anymore, any one of those reasons could trigger a sell-off. Of course, if it fails to report its financials by the Nasdaq's latest deadline, that too could quickly send the stock spiraling.\n\nSuper Micro is one of the more volatile stocks on the market right now. Unless you have a high risk tolerance, you may want to just take a wait-and-see approach with it for now."

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nDevOps has become a cornerstone of modern software development, bridging the gap between development and IT operations to create a seamless, efficient, and agile approach to application delivery. Over the years, DevOps has evolved, and in 2024, it is continuing to transform with the rise of cutting-edge technologies, new methodologies, and a heightened focus on automation and security. This article explores the latest trends and innovations in the world of DevOps and how organizations can stay ahead of the curve in this rapidly changing landscape.\n\nAI and Machine Learning in DevOps\n\nThe integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) into DevOps processes is no longer a distant vision but a growing reality. AI-powered tools are enhancing various aspects of DevOps, from automating repetitive tasks to optimizing resource allocation. Some key areas where AI and ML are making a significant impact include:\n\nPredictive Analytics for Incident Management : AI is being used to analyze patterns in past incidents, predict potential failures, and recommend solutions before they escalate into critical issues. This shift enables teams to proactively address problems rather than react after the fact.\n\n: AI is being used to analyze patterns in past incidents, predict potential failures, and recommend solutions before they escalate into critical issues.

Automated Testing : Machine learning algorithms can now automatically generate test cases based on code changes, drastically reducing the need for manual test creation. This speeds up the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring higher quality releases and faster deployment times.\n\n: Machine learning algorithms can now automatically generate test cases based on code changes, drastically reducing the need for manual test creation. This speeds up the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring higher quality releases and faster deployment times. Self-Healing Systems: AI-driven DevOps tools are capable of detecting system anomalies and automatically resolving issues without human intervention, minimizing downtime and improving system reliability.\n\nDevSecOps: The Increasing Focus on Security\n\nAs cyber threats become more sophisticated, the importance of security in the DevOps lifecycle has never been clearer. DevSecOps, the practice of integrating security into the DevOps process, continues to gain momentum in 2024. The key benefits and developments in DevSecOps include:\n\nShift Left Security : Moving security measures earlier in the development process, also known as \u201cshifting left,\u201d ensures that security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed during the coding phase rather than post-deployment. This minimizes the risks of breaches and reduces the cost of fixing vulnerabilities.\n\n: Moving security measures earlier in the development process, also known as \u201cshifting left,\u201d ensures that security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed during the coding phase rather than post-deployment. This minimizes the risks of breaches and reduces the cost of fixing vulnerabilities. Automated Security Testing : With the growing need for speed, DevOps teams are turning to automation tools for vulnerability scanning and code analysis. These tools can run automated security checks throughout the entire software development pipeline, making it easier to detect issues and fix them before they reach production.\n\n: With the growing need for speed, DevOps teams are turning to automation tools for vulnerability scanning and code analysis. These tools can run automated security checks throughout the entire software development pipeline, making it easier to detect issues and fix them before they reach production. Security as Code: Security policies and configurations are now being treated as code and stored in version control, enabling teams to manage security requirements through infrastructure as code (IaC) practices. This enhances consistency, scalability, and compliance in managing security policies.\n\nGitOps: Revolutionizing Continuous Delivery\n\nGitOps is an emerging paradigm that simplifies and accelerates the process of managing infrastructure and deployments using Git as the single source of truth. This practice is gaining traction in 2024 due to its ability to streamline workflows and enhance collaboration between development and operations teams.\n\nKey benefits of GitOps include:\n\nVersion-Controlled Infrastructure : By storing infrastructure definitions in Git repositories, DevOps teams can leverage version control to track changes, roll back updates, and ensure consistency across environments. This approach reduces configuration drift and provides full audit trails for compliance.\n\n: By storing infrastructure definitions in Git repositories, DevOps teams can leverage version control to track changes, roll back updates, and ensure consistency across environments. This approach reduces configuration drift and provides full audit trails for compliance. Declarative Infrastructure Management : GitOps employs declarative syntax, where the desired state of the system is defined in code. Any divergence from this desired state is automatically corrected, ensuring that systems remain in a predictable, stable state.\n\n: GitOps employs declarative syntax, where the desired state of the system is defined in code. Any divergence from this desired state is automatically corrected, ensuring that systems remain in a predictable, stable state. Improved Collaboration: GitOps enhances collaboration by allowing both developers and operations teams to work with the same Git workflows, improving transparency and reducing the barriers between the two functions.\n\nServerless and Cloud-Native DevOps\n\nServerless computing and cloud-native architectures continue to be a major focus for DevOps teams in 2025. The serverless approach allows developers to focus purely on writing code without worrying about infrastructure management. Key developments include:\n\nServerless CI/CD : The advent of serverless CI/CD pipelines has made it easier for DevOps teams to build and deploy applications without worrying about managing underlying infrastructure. Serverless platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions allow teams to focus on application logic while the platform automatically scales to meet demand.\n\n: The advent of serverless CI/CD pipelines has made it easier for DevOps teams to build and deploy applications without worrying about managing underlying infrastructure. Serverless platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions allow teams to focus on application logic while the platform automatically scales to meet demand. Cloud-Native Tools : Cloud-native tools such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Prometheus are helping teams adopt a microservices-based architecture, enabling greater scalability and resilience in their applications. DevOps teams are leveraging Kubernetes for managing containers and orchestrating services in cloud environments.\n\n: Cloud-native tools such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Prometheus are helping teams adopt a microservices-based architecture, enabling greater scalability and resilience in their applications. DevOps teams are leveraging Kubernetes for managing containers and orchestrating services in cloud environments. Event-Driven Architectures: Serverless computing is intrinsically tied to event-driven architectures, where applications respond to triggers (e.g., HTTP requests, database changes, etc.) rather than relying on traditional monolithic processes. This approach ensures that resources are used efficiently, and applications scale effortlessly.\n\nThe Rise of Observability in DevOps\n\nAs applications grow more complex, the need for real-time insights into system performance has become critical. Observability is no longer an afterthought but a primary focus of DevOps practices. The key trends in observability for 2024 include:\n\nUnified Observability Platforms : Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry are being used to collect and analyze metrics, logs, and traces from various sources within the system. By aggregating data from different components into a single platform, teams can gain a more comprehensive understanding of system performance.\n\n: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry are being used to collect and analyze metrics, logs, and traces from various sources within the system.

AI and ML for Enhanced Observability: Just as AI and ML are transforming other aspects of DevOps, they are also being used to detect anomalies in observability data, helping teams quickly pinpoint root causes of performance issues.\n\nThe Emergence of DevOps for Artificial Intelligence (AI/ML DevOps)\n\nAI/ML applications are becoming integral to many industries, and as such, DevOps for AI/ML (also known as MLOps) has emerged as a critical field. MLOps introduces new challenges in automation, collaboration, and monitoring specific to machine learning models and data pipelines.\n\nModel Versioning and Governance : Just as DevOps emphasizes the importance of version-controlled infrastructure, MLOps stresses the need for managing model versions. This ensures that models are retrained appropriately, results are reproducible, and compliance is maintained.\n\n: Just as DevOps emphasizes the importance of version-controlled infrastructure, MLOps stresses the need for managing model versions.

            "article_content": "The federal landscape is constantly shifting due to technological breakthroughs, modernization needs, leadership change-overs and emerging priorities. This is never more true than at the beginning of a new presidential administration, and 2025 is sure to be a transformational and pivotal year in determining how the remainder of this decade and beyond will take shape on an organizational level.\n\nMeriTalk recently interviewed Federal CIOs to understand their top tech priorities for 2025. They found that cybersecurity, workforce transformation, and AI rank as the top technology priorities in the Federal government, but that funding and skills gaps are hindering progress in these areas.\n\nGovCon Wire spoke with Ben Baldi, senior vice president of global public sector at automated software testing company Tricentis, to get his unique perspective on how the federal government is evolving and how the industrial base can accommodate the transformations. He touched on the ins and outs of data management, differences one might see in procurement processes and much more.\n\nGovCon Wire: Despite ongoing efforts to close the skills gap, year over year, workforce transformation remains a challenge for the federal government. What needs to change, and where do you think agencies can make progress in this area in 2025?\n\nBen Baldi: Workforce transformation has been a perennial challenge for the federal government, and I don\u2019t see that changing in 2025. What I do see, though, are opportunities for progress if agencies take a more focused and strategic approach.\n\nFirst, automation will be key. By adopting test automation, agencies can free up IT personnel from repetitive, time-consuming tasks and allow them to focus on higher-value priorities like cybersecurity and innovation. Additionally, leveraging low-code and no-code tools can democratize technology adoption across the workforce, enabling non-technical employees to contribute to digital transformation efforts. These are smart ways to stretch tight budgets while optimizing skilled resources, accelerating modernization and reducing operational bottlenecks.\n\nSecond, we need to rethink training. The federal workforce operates in an increasingly complex environment, so employees must be prepared to wear multiple hats. Agencies should offer cross-disciplinary training in areas like cybersecurity, quality assurance, data analytics and cloud computing. Partnering with private sector organizations and building strong mentorship programs can also help employees stay agile and ready for emerging challenges.\n\nFinally, agencies must double down on creating a purpose-driven culture. People stay when they feel their work matters, whether it\u2019s advancing national security, improving public health, or driving innovation that will impact society at large. Leaders can inspire commitment by celebrating successes, showing the real-world effects of their teams\u2019 work and involving employees in meaningful decision-making.\n\nIn 2025, agencies that integrate these strategies\u2014automation, training and mission-driven culture\u2014will be better positioned to close the skills gap and build a workforce that\u2019s ready to tackle future challenges.\n\nGCW: From the same survey, federal CIOs reported that improving data readiness was one of their top AI goals for 2025. What steps do agencies need to take in 2025 to improve data readiness?\n\nBaldi: In 2025, I predict we\u2019ll see data readiness take center stage as agencies ramp up their AI and generative AI initiatives. The message is clear: without high-quality, well-structured data, even the most sophisticated AI tools will fall short. That\u2019s why improving data readiness is becoming a top priority for federal CIOs\u2014and rightly so.\n\nData readiness means having data that\u2019s clean, structured and ready to be used for analysis and decision-making. But you can\u2019t have true data readiness without data integrity\u2014that is, ensuring the data is accurate, consistent and reliable from start to finish. The two go hand in hand, and both are essential for successful AI programs.\n\nIn 2025, agencies will need to adopt smarter, more proactive approaches to improve both. I expect to see a big push for automation to handle routine data checks, like identifying errors, inconsistencies, or missing values before they cause bigger problems. Agencies will also likely lean on real-time dashboards and alerts to monitor data quality and address issues like data drift as soon as they arise.\n\nAnother prediction? Strategic checkpoints will become standard practice. As data flows through increasingly complex systems\u2014think hybrid environments, multi-cloud setups, and diverse applications\u2014agencies will need built-in safeguards to detect changes in data structures to prevent biases from creeping in.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing new use cases emerge for data integrity, from validating data during migrations to ensuring operational accuracy in enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems and meeting compliance demands. These are areas where agencies can make immediate progress while preparing for the bigger AI picture.\n\nUltimately, 2025 will be about laying the groundwork. Agencies that prioritize data readiness and integrity now will position themselves to unlock AI and generative AI\u2019s full potential\u2014driving efficiency, innovation, and better services for citizens.\n\nGCW: How have you seen government IT procurement evolve over the last year, and what changes do you envision in 2025?\n\nBaldi: Another key trend we\u2019re observing is the growing prioritization of automated software testing in government procurement. Requests for proposals are increasingly mandating software testing\u2014especially automated testing\u2014as a standard requirement. This shift highlights a recognition among agencies of the critical role continuous testing plays in minimizing operational risks and achieving mission objectives. Additionally, we\u2019re seeing an emphasis on embedding security testing early in the software development lifecycle, reflecting broader DevSecOps trends and enabling public sector IT teams to deliver secure applications more efficiently.\n\nAt the same time, agencies are navigating heightened complexity within their technology ecosystems. From on-premises setups to multi-cloud and hybrid environments, and across microservices and enterprise applications like Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Oracle, and Workday, agencies must ensure seamless and consistent testing across diverse systems and platforms. Automated software testing allows agencies to do just that.\n\nGCW: What other emerging trends or challenges do you foresee shaping government agencies\u2019 strategies in 2025, particularly in anticipation of a new administration?\n\nBaldi: In 2025, many are expecting government agencies will face significant pressure to adapt to shifting priorities under the Department of Government Efficiency . This initiative will emphasize leaner, more independent teams, pushing agencies to streamline operations and embrace automation to replace outdated manual processes. Agencies will need to accelerate modernization efforts, as efficiency and speed will be paramount to meeting tighter fiscal demands. Those that fail to adopt scalable and automated solutions risk falling behind, particularly as federal and state budgets increasingly prioritize innovation and agility. Software testing, particularly automated testing, will be a cornerstone of these efforts, enabling agencies to modernize faster and with greater efficiency.\n\nAt the same time, I expect unspent infrastructure funds and shifting budget allocations will create urgency for agencies to act strategically. Departments like the Department of Homeland Security are expected to receive substantial funding increases, presenting opportunities for targeted modernization efforts. However, as the 2026 budget cycle looms, agencies must prepare for unpredictable shifts in funding and priorities. Success will require a forward-looking approach\u2014balancing compliance with efficiency mandates while leveraging data-driven insights to address program demands and unlock growth opportunities in a competitive and evolving environment."

Six months on, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re about to see mini PCs that deliver the AI performance required for features like Recall, Click To Do, and AI-powered image generation and editing in Windows 11. These mini PCs might even help Microsoft compete with Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nAsus became the first PC manufacturer to announce a mini PC that\u2019s Copilot Plus capable in September. It then revealed the full specs of its upcoming NUC 14 Pro AI last month, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that kicks off next week. Asus\u2019 mini PC even has a Copilot button on the front and is almost identical to the size of Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nThe timing of Asus\u2019 spec drop came on the same day that Taiwanese company Geekom revealed three new mini PCs that it will showcase at CES. Geekom is releasing a mini PC with AMD\u2019s Strix Point CPUs inside and one with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processor, meaning both will be Copilot Plus compatible. The third model is powered by Intel\u2019s unannounced Arrow Lake-H laptop processors, which are unlikely to have an NPU sufficient enough to be Copilot Plus compatible.\n\nI\u2019m going to be paying close attention to CES next week to see if there are any other Windows OEMs that are ready to launch Copilot Plus mini PCs. CES is usually a launch point for Microsoft\u2019s latest laptop or tablet initiatives, and last year the company convinced OEMs to put a Copilot key on their laptop keyboards. Asus wouldn\u2019t be adding a Copilot button on the front of its own mini PC without Microsoft\u2019s involvement, so I wonder how many other PC makers Microsoft has been working with to add dedicated Copilot buttons.\n\nGeekom\u2019s mention of Qualcomm chips inside its mini PC means we\u2019ll start to see Qualcomm\u2019s latest chips venture beyond laptops for the first time. Qualcomm was supposed to ship its mini PC Snapdragon Dev Kit in June alongside Copilot Plus laptops, but it ended up canceling it months later after issues with manufacturing the device. Qualcomm has also teased that its Snapdragon X Elite chips could appear in mini PCs or even all-in-one PCs, so perhaps we\u2019ll see some Copilot Plus all-in-one PCs next week, too.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see when we might get Copilot Plus features on traditional powerful desktop PCs. Intel\u2019s latest Core Ultra desktop CPU arrived in October with an NPU inside, but it wasn\u2019t capable enough to hit the 40 TOPS requirement that Microsoft mandates for Copilot Plus features. We\u2019re going to have to wait until next-gen desktop CPUs from Intel and AMD arrive to see if more capable NPUs are a priority for chipmakers. Until then, mini PCs and all-in-one PCs that use laptop processors are going to be the only way to get Copilot Plus features in a desktop PC form factor.\n\nWhile Copilot Plus features remain limited to Windows PCs, that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t see the main Copilot assistant appear on more devices. I\u2019ve heard from multiple sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans that the company is keen to get Copilot on devices beyond just PCs, phones, and tablets.\n\nWe might well see Copilot appear on some unexpected hardware at CES next week, just as Microsoft has also been hinting about its ambitions for dedicated AI hardware in recent months. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri admitted in an October Notepad interview that the power of modern AI models \u201cwill free up the ability to innovate in hardware and come out with purpose-built hardware.\u201d\n\nDavuluri stopped short of detailing what dedicated AI hardware would look like for Microsoft, but weeks later Yusuf Mehdi, executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft, dropped some additional hints in an underreported interview with YouTuber Austin Evans.\n\n\u201cThese devices that see the world, that you wear on your body, on your person, I think that those combined with AI will be very valuable,\u201d said Mehdi in late October. \u201cIt can do image recognition, it can talk to you about what\u2019s going on. I think that\u2019s a fascinating place that we\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview Mehdi also describes wearable health-related devices as exciting and \u201ca big opportunity\u201d for the future. Microsoft then confirmed last month that Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has hired multiple former colleagues to help run a new AI health unit. It\u2019s hard to imagine Microsoft venturing into fitness wearables again after the Microsoft Band was scrapped in 2016, but I could definitely see the company wanting to partner with device manufacturers and offer up AI-powered health services for these types of devices.\n\nEither way, 2025 won\u2019t see Microsoft slow down with its ambition to get Copilot on all the screens we look at every day.\n\nThe pad:\n\nThanks for subscribing and reading to the very end. I\u2019ll be reflecting on Microsoft\u2019s 50-year history in Notepad later this year, so if there\u2019s a particular period of time you\u2019re interested in hearing more about,please get in touch: notepad@theverge.com."

            "article_content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The following is a guest post from Ang Troy, senior director analyst at Gartner.\n\nMost IT organizations have cloud services in place or have made conscious decisions regarding its adoption. Such decisions may include adopting the cloud quickly and wholly, to proceed methodically with cloud services or to delay for a period of time.\n\nIn any of these strategies, IT organizations face major obstacles building, deploying, consuming, managing, securing and integrating cloud services.\n\nThe adoption of cloud computing is multidimensional, and it must be run like a multiyear program, not a fixed-duration project. As a result, the complexity of cloud adoption requires at least one accountable architectural leader to guide the organization through the transformation. This is the task of a role that many IT organizations are now finding to be mandatory: the enterprise cloud architect.\n\nMany organizations can clearly point to their lead enterprise cloud architect, but others have yet to formally name this individual or have piled the cloud responsibilities onto an already overburdened enterprise architect. Organizations that are the most successful have formally assigned cloud architecture responsibilities to ensure that a single, accountable architect is in charge.\n\nWhat is an enterprise cloud architect?\n\nAn enterprise cloud architect is responsible for the cloud computing initiatives in an organization and for directing the architectural aspects of the cloud team across all aspects of IT and the business.\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect should be the foundation of a cloud center of excellence, or what will become the CCOE \u2014 the enterprise architecture function that governs the organization\u2019s approach to the cloud.\n\nCommon alternative names for a CCOE include: the cloud business office, the cloud transformation office, the cloud brokerage team and the cloud enablement team.\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect is usually a senior individual contributor who serves as the leader of the CCOE \u2014 or, if there is no cloud EA function, then as the leader of cloud initiatives.\n\nOften, the role of the enterprise cloud architect is largely self-directed, and day-to-day responsibilities are usually fluid. The specific tasks vary, depending on the level of the organization\u2019s cloud maturity and the maturity of its CCOE.\n\nEnterprise cloud architects are typically not \u201chands-on.\u201d They will make decisions, but hand off responsibility for their technical implementation to a cloud engineering function. Cloud technical architects may be hands-on, but they are associated with the cloud engineering function, not the CCOE.\n\nWhere cloud sits in the organization\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect is the foundation of the CCOE, and may be the only member of this hub in some organizations.\n\nCompanies may not have a structured center of excellence in name, and may rely on the enterprise cloud architect to effectively assume the role of this center. This is a common and acceptable practice, though Gartner recommends building out the CCOE with additional members.\n\nRegardless of the organizational design, the enterprise cloud architect has six key relationships:\n\nAdvisory-level access to senior IT leaders, either directly or through the EA team Direct and collaborative access to senior EA teams Direct and collaborative access to domain architecture teams Collaborative access to technical architects and teams Collaborative access to central function architects and teams Collaborative access to business unit representatives to discern business needs for specific solutions\n\nSkill sets of enterprise cloud architects\n\nDue to the broad applicability of cloud computing in an organization, it\u2019s unlikely that any individual will possess all the skills that the enterprise cloud architect role demands. However, the enterprise cloud architect should possess as many of the desired skills as possible.\n\nWhere a specific skill is lacking, the enterprise cloud architect should be able to collaborate or engage the relevant, resident experts in the organization. For example, if the enterprise cloud architect does not have a skill or strength in IT service management (ITSM), that individual needs to build a strong relationship with an ITSM expert to drive objectives to completion.\n\nAt the core, enterprise cloud architects are enterprise architects. Therefore, they need to have the competencies of good enterprise architects in order to drive business outcomes, empower business partners and develop and build effective architecture disciplines\n\nCloud computing is not a matter of \u201cif\u201d; it\u2019s a matter of \u201chow.\u201d Adopting cloud services is similar to a complex IT program that has no clear end in sight. Guiding cloud adoption requires strong leadership, not just at an executive level, but also at an architectural level.\n\nEnterprise cloud architects are paramount to the eventual success of cloud adoption. Organizations should not delay placing the right individual into this crucial IT role."

The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it?

That\u2019s why the Cowboy State is one of the best places to see and possibly explain the unexplainable.\n\nThe National UFO Center keeps records of every sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) reported in the United States since 1995.\n\nThe website Stacker used that data to compile a list of the top 10 with the most reports of strange, inexplainable sights in the night sky.\n\nThe world of UFO and UAP sightings has gotten more serious in the last several years, and more people are looking up and looking for answers.\n\n\u201cI can tell you is that quite a few sightings in Wyoming remain unexplained,\u201d said Richard Beckwith, Rock Springs city attorney and part-time UFO investigator.\n\nHe\u2019s spent decades investigating UFO sightings in Wyoming, but had his first personal experience with one spotted near Green River earlier in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon is real,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the Pentagon has admitted UFOs and UAFs are real, and they can\u2019t explain them. It was treated as a joke for most of the time I\u2019ve been doing it, and now it\u2019s become real.\u201d\n\nThe List\n\nOverall, the National UFO Center has 421 reports of UFOs and UAFs in Wyoming. Cheyenne tops the list of Wyoming places with the most sightings, reporting 50 aerial phenomena since 1995.\n\nSeeing Cheyenne at the top doesn\u2019t surprise Beckwith at all. One would expect more sightings in Wyoming\u2019s most populated city, but Cheyenne is also home to a critical U.S. Air Force base.\n\n\u201cWyoming\u2019s UFO sightings, from my perspective, primarily appear over the Warren Air Force Base and the nearby missile silos,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been quite a few sightings, going back to the 1950s.\u201d\n\nCasper is second with 37 UFO sightings, followed by Laramie with 29, Rock Springs with 17 and Gillette with 15. Cody, Sheridan, Riverton and Evanston round out the bottom half of the list.\n\nYellowstone National Park sits at the bottom with eight UFO sightings. Sasquatch isn\u2019t the only elusive and mysterious thing hanging around the pristine wilderness of northwest Wyoming.\n\nThe state that\u2019s seen and reported the most UFOs is California, with more than 16,500 sightings. The Pentagon attributes most of these sightings to balloons, drones, aircraft and other terrestrial sources.\n\nOne thing Wyomingites won\u2019t want to do is try to shoot down any UFOs they spot. If that UFO happens to be a neighbor\u2019s drone, that would violate federal law and could come with a fine and a jail sentence .\n\nNot Explaining The Unexplainable\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that the number of sightings corresponds with Wyoming\u2019s most populated areas. Beckwith said that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been, but that doesn\u2019t make these phenomena any easier to explain.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, we had the simple explanation that these were aliens from another planet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the longer I\u2019ve done this, the explanations have become more elusive. It\u2019s much more complex than that.\u201d\n\nModern-day theories for UFOs and UAP include black technology programs, foreign espionage and astronomical events in addition to the extraterrestrial. If there are any probable explanations for what\u2019s been seen over Wyoming and elsewhere, the federal government has declined to comment or elaborate.\n\n\u201cThey continue to say emphatically that we have no evidence that these objects are extraterrestrial in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cThat begs the question \u2014 if they can\u2019t explain it, how can they determine that these objects are also simultaneously not manufactured elsewhere? It's almost like, \u2018Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.\u2019\u201d\n\nRecently, there have been three congressional hearings on UFOs and UAFs, and Beckwith said he\u2019s spoken with two members of U.S. Congress about the phenomenon. Wyoming scientists are skeptical of their findings, but Beckwith described it as one of the rare bipartisan issues that has reached Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPeople who looked at this phenomenon were ridiculed about this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s changed since 2017, now that the government has admitted they\u2019re real.\u201d\n\nWyoming Watchers\n\nBeckwith is one of four Wyoming field investigators for the Mutual UFO Network, an organization of civilian volunteers that follow up on and report UFO and UAF sightings. The number of investigators shows Beckwith how much interest has grown for these unexplainable phenomena in the last decade.\n\n\u201cI have investigators in Cheyenne, Riverton, and two in Rock Springs that investigate sightings all over the state,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil a couple of years ago, I was the only one.\u201d\n\nBeckwith described his first experience with a UFO back in March. He used his Sony SR4 camera to capture a video of \u201canomalous nocturnal lights\u201d hovering near Green River.\n\n\u201cI got the radar records from that night, but haven\u2019t been able to correlate what I saw with any particular targets on the radar,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly didn't have a transponder. So, to that extent, I can't explain it. But I saw and filmed it.\u201d\n\nBeckwith hopes more Wyomingites will report any UFO or UAF sightings to the National UFO Center or the Mutual UFO Network. Regardless of what people believe they've seen in the sky, he and many others want answers.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of space and open sky in Wyoming. Beckwith believes the Cowboy State could be the key to getting better data and information to shine more light into the darkness surrounding UFOs and UAFs.\n\n\u201cWyoming is the ninth-largest state in land area, and we have the lowest population,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, we have sightings with several witnesses in different locations. They\u2019re rarer than other places, but they still occur.\u201d\n\nAndrew Rossi can be reached at arossi@cowboystatedaily.com."

Others deemed the video a fake, and a cluster still holds steadfast that it was alien activity, the Daily Mail said.\n\nThe Falcon 9 rocket has a \u201creusable first stage booster\u201d that ultimately fell back to the planet just eight and a half minutes after it left the ground. It was caught in the Atlantic Ocean on a drone ship.\n\nStitch, on the other hand, will return to theaters worldwide May 23, 2025, in a live-action version of the 2002 animated film of the same name. The lovable blue alien has been infiltrating other Disney movie advertisements in recent months, including the newly released film, \u201cMufasa.\u201d"

Ajith, astrophysicist with the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bengaluru, has said.\n\nHe was at the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium (RSCP) in Kozhikode on Thursday (January 2) to deliver a lecture demonstration on \u2018Universe: yesterday, today and tomorrow\u2019. It is the first in the \u2018Cosmic Snapshots\u2019 series of lectures being organised by the RSCP.\n\nMr. Ajith pointed out that the concept of a primordial atom, proposed in the early 20th century by Georges Lemaitre, who is considered the father of the Big Bang theory, was just a \u201cstory\u201d and not a scientific fact. According to Lemaitre, the universe began with an explosion from a single particle at a specific moment in time. \u201cThe primordial atom is just a way of explaining what might have happened. At some point, the universe shrank into one tiny entity. To understand what happened then, we need to combine Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity with quantum physics,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ajith traced the history of our understanding of the universe, starting with Nicolaus Copernicus, who first suggested a sun-centered universe, and Galileo Galilei, who proved it through observations. \u201cGalileo\u2019s discoveries changed how we saw the universe and sparked the age of enlightenment and the Renaissance, leading to modern science and technology,\u201d he said. German astronomer Kepler improved Copernicus\u2019 ideas, discovering that planets move in elliptical orbits. Isaac Newton later proposed that the same force making an apple fall also keeps planets revolving around the Sun.\n\nMr. Ajith highlighted that Newton\u2019s laws of motion are still used today, especially in rocket science. He explained how the sun-centered universe concept evolved, revealing the Sun as just a small part of the Milky Way. Later, astronomers debated whether Earth was part of a single galaxy or many. Edward Hubble then developed a telescope to measure the distance to distant galaxies. Mr. Ajith also mentioned Einstein\u2019s theory, which described gravity not as a force, but as the effect of space-time, a concept he introduced to explain how gravity impacts space and the flow of time."

            "article_content": "Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity has revolutionized our understanding of gravity and the universe. However, it leaves some unanswered questions, particularly about singularities and black holes.\n\nRecent studies suggest quantum mechanics could help resolve these mysteries and offer new insights into the fundamental nature of space-time and black holes.\n\nGeneral relativity\n\nGeneral relativity is a theory developed by Albert Einstein to explain how gravity works.\n\nInstead of thinking of gravity as a force that pulls objects toward each other, like Isaac Newton suggested, Einstein proposed that gravity is the result of massive objects bending the space and time around them.\n\nImagine space and time as a stretchy fabric, and when something heavy, like the Earth or the Sun, sits on it, the fabric bends around it.\n\nThis bending is what we experience as gravity. So, objects like planets and moons move in curved paths because they are following the curves in this \u201cfabric\u201d created by mass.\n\nOne of the most mind-blowing predictions of general relativity is that time isn\u2019t the same everywhere.\n\nTime actually moves slower near a strong gravitational field, like near a planet or a star, and faster in areas with weaker gravity.\n\nThis effect is known as time dilation. It\u2019s something that satellites in space have to account for because they experience time a little differently than we do on Earth.\n\nUnderstanding singularities \u2013 the basics\n\nThe elegant framework of general relativity encounters a critical limitation at singularities \u2013 points in space-time where matter collapses to infinite density, and the curvature of space-time becomes infinitely sharp.\n\nThese singularities arise under extreme gravitational collapse, as shown by Nobel laureate Roger Penrose. When a massive star exhausts its fuel and collapses under its gravity, the result can be a singularity.\n\nAt a singularity, the fundamental laws of physics, as we know them, no longer work. Concepts like time, space, and the behavior of matter lose their meaning, rendering physical predictions impossible.\n\nThis unpredictability would challenge science\u2019s foundation, which relies on consistent, testable laws to explain the universe.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing singularities is, therefore, a major challenge in modern physics.\n\nResearchers aim to find ways to reconcile this breakdown, often looking to quantum mechanics or other advanced theories to fill the gaps left by general relativity.\n\nBlack holes and cosmic censorship\n\nBlack holes, nature\u2019s enigmatic phenomena, may conceal singularities. Their defining feature, the event horizon, prevents anything, including light, from escaping.\n\nAccording to Penrose\u2019s cosmic censorship conjecture, singularities resulting from gravitational collapse remain hidden behind these event horizons, preserving the predictability of physics elsewhere in the universe.\n\nDespite its elegance, cosmic censorship remains unproven. Scientists have found no definitive counterexamples, making it one of the most significant open problems in mathematical physics.\n\nQuantum mechanics and black holes\n\nWhile general relativity focuses on large-scale structures, quantum mechanics governs particles and atoms.\n\nCombining these frameworks to understand black holes has proven complex. Recent research published in the journal Physical Review Letters suggests that Penrose\u2019s conjecture is supported by quantum mechanics.\n\nPhysicists have long speculated about \u201cquantum black holes,\u201d where quantum effects play a significant role. These black holes raise questions about how cosmic censorship applies in the quantum realm.\n\nA potential answer lies in developing a theory of \u201cquantum gravity,\u201d which integrates quantum mechanics with space-time. However, such a theory remains elusive.\n\nAdvances in quantum cosmic censorship\n\nQuantum mechanics introduces new complexities such as negative energy, a phenomenon allowed in quantum mechanics but absent in classical physics.\n\nPenrose\u2019s theorem assumes that all matter has positive energy, so the existence of negative energy introduces scenarios that the theorem does not address.\n\nTo explore these complexities, researchers use a hybrid approach called semi-classical gravity. In this model, the space-time structure still obeys Einstein\u2019s general relativity, but the matter within it is treated according to quantum mechanics.\n\nThis allows scientists to study how quantum effects influence the behavior of space-time and black holes.\n\nFrom this perspective, quantum mechanics might play a role in keeping singularities hidden. The concept, called quantum cosmic censorship, proposes that quantum effects could reinforce the \u201cclothing\u201d of singularities by black hole event horizons.\n\nThis means that quantum mechanics may prevent singularities from becoming observable, thus modifying their behavior and preserving the predictability of the universe.\n\nThe idea builds on Penrose\u2019s original cosmic censorship conjecture but extends it into the quantum realm, offering a potential bridge between classical and quantum physics.\n\nThe energy of space-time\n\nA key to understanding quantum cosmic censorship lies in the Penrose inequality. This mathematical relationship links the mass of space-time to the area of black hole horizons, assuming cosmic censorship holds. In quantum systems, a similar inequality could provide insights.\n\nIn 2019, researchers proposed a quantum Penrose inequality. Building on this, the new study introduced a refined version that applies even in strong quantum effects.\n\nThe research shows that the energy of space-time relates to the combined entropy of black holes and quantum matter, which thus maintains the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nStrengthening theories with quantum mechanics\n\nThe new quantum Penrose inequality strengthens the idea of cosmic censorship. While not a definitive proof, it shows that quantum mechanics reinforces the principles governing black holes and singularities.\n\nThis advance bridges classical and quantum physics, and paves the way for deeper insights into the universe.\n\nAs space-time might end at singularities, quantum mechanics ensures we remain shielded from such extremes, preserving the predictability of our universe.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?
