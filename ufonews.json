It was one of three unidentified objects blasted out of the sky that month, according to CTV News.\n\nIt remains unclear what the object was and what it was doing flying over western Canada."

            "article_content": "Dec. 7\u2014The arcane red light reportedly throbbed in the sky above Albuquerque's South Valley for about an hour in October 2023, caught on camera by a bewildered man who says, \"I've never seen a light that bright.\"\n\nA solid, bright orb drifted with angular elegance in February over Jal, near the state's southern border, startling an observer. As the nighttime scene unfolded near a Lea County oilfield, the observer reported feeling like the air was astir with a leaden static.\n\nVideos of these episodes of stargazing turning bizarre in a state known for enigmatic nighttime occurrences are among those catalogued by a popular UFO reporting platform and cellphone app operated by Enigma Labs. The company, founded in 2020, has issued a new report naming New Mexico its top state for sightings per capita, with several strange videos submitted this year showing lights over Albuquerque.\n\n\"New Mexico is a focal point for UFOs,\" said Alejandro Rojas, a consultant for Enigma Labs. \"But it's really interesting that New Mexico has really popped up in our data lately as being heads above the leader when it comes to submissions per person.\"\n\nThe data set comes as an obsession with unidentified flying objects continues nationwide, even after a congressionally mandated Pentagon report released in February found no evidence the federal government was covering up knowledge of extraterrestrial technology and no evidence UFO sightings are signs of aliens visiting Earth.\n\nA Pentagon office, known as the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, was created in 2022 to track what the government calls UAPs \u2014 unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 with 757 reported to the office between May and June of this year, according to a November report.\n\nStill, people continue to see things.\n\nIn the fast-paced digital age, Enigma Labs provides an online trove of oddities \u2014 an endless proliferation of sights and sounds.\n\nThe private company offers a website and cellphone app allowing UFO enthusiasts \u2014 and regular people who believe they have encountered the anomalous \u2014 to upload videos and photos with descriptions, aggregating and crowdsourcing the data.\n\n\"Like millions of ants crawling around us,\" the individual who spotted something in Jal said in the Enigma post.\n\n\"I hate to say it. Those are ships!\" gushed a man who claimed he was witnessing alien plasma ships in Gallup near the Arizona border.\n\nAll told, the Land of Enchantment's rate of 12.2 Enigma entries per 100,000 people is far higher than the next closest states of Nevada and Arizona, which boast submission rates of around 9 per 100,000 residents, according to the company.\n\nUFO researchers have theories about the large volume of entries here, citing how alien mythology and lore have been woven into the state's cultural fabric for decades. According to the National UFO Reporting Center, 1,708 sightings have been reported in New Mexico, most of them since 2000.\n\n\"We have a relatively small population, but the one thing we do have, and I think this factors into your question, is a preponderance of military operations areas and scientific development areas \u2014 Los Alamos [National Laboratory], Sandia [National Laboratories] \u2014 a rich history of sightings,\" said David Marler, a longtime UFO researcher who lives in the Albuquerque area and serves as the executive director of a new UFO records center in Rio Rancho.\n\nWhile the Roswell incident has long been a dominant talker, Marler said there are many other intriguing reports of encounters over the last 75 years in New Mexico: April 1964, Socorro; April 1964, La Madera; March 1950, Farmington; November 1957, Kirtland Air Force Base.\n\nA prevalent state for sightings\n\nEnigma Labs runs a New Mexico page that archives and cataloging sightings, rating and categorizing videos.\n\nAs of late November, the company had received 278 New Mexico sightings directly, according to an email from Rojas. Combined with publicly available sources, it has 3,531 total sightings in New Mexico archived.\n\n\"When you go back and look at early magazine reports and military reports going back to the 1950s, there were magazine articles showing maps where a lot of UFO sightings. One of the most prevalent states was New Mexico,\" Marler said.\n\nA fascination with the unknown has long gripped New Mexico. It's a state renowned \u2014 thanks to its dry climate, low population density and sprawling deserts \u2014 for its night sky viewing.\n\n\"One of the most spectacular reports is from last August. A witness said they were watching TV when they caught this weird object out of the corner of their eye. They were able to get a few seconds of video before it disappeared behind nearby trees,\" Rojas said of video footage taken in Chaparral, a Southern New Mexico community near El Paso.\n\nThe video shows a floating gray object with a television heard in the background.\n\nNew Mexico sightings logged into the Enigma Labs database break down like this: Albuquerque, 754; Las Cruces, 159; Roswell, 143; Alamogordo, 107; and Deming, 95. Rojas said eight sightings have been reported to Enigma from Santa Fe and one in Los Alamos.\n\nTwo friends were driving along San Mateo Boulevard in Albuquerque late one night in February when a moving craft in the sky lit up with lights flashing in a diagonal pattern.\n\nIn an episode that lasted about a minute, \"it went from a long craft to a triangle shaped craft with only 3 lights, and then to something that resembled a helicopter with one light, and quickly disappeared,\" states the caption on the for the video posted to Enigma Lab's site.\n\nNew records center in Rio Rancho\n\nTens of thousands of case files, among the earliest dated in 1947, are housed in Rio Rancho. They relay the stories of witnesses, couched in the diction of reports written by law enforcement officers or members of the military as far back as 70 years ago.\n\nThe files can be pored over at the new National UFO Historical Records Center, a facility that recently opened and can be visited by appointment.\n\n\"It's the largest historical archive ever assembled on the history of the subject in the history of the United States,\" said Marler, the director.\n\nThe volunteer-operated research center, at 1301 Nicklaus Drive SE, opened in October.\n\nIt holds rolls of decades-old microfilm, hundreds of thousands of audio recordings, an exhaustive library of foreign and domestic magazines, newsletters and periodicals \u2014 all dealing with reports of mysterious craft spotted from Earth. Some 2,000 books line the shelves, along with an interminable supply of UFO investigations and intrigue, with tales and testimony for those who believe.\n\n\"It's really set up for academics and for the general public who have a serious interest in the subject. It's not for the casual enthusiast per se,\" Marler said.\n\nThe center has files from the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena, records kept by the largest citizen organization in the U.S. devoted to cataloguing UFO reports from 1956 until 1980, the year the group published its final newsletter. The center is currently digitizing the files for the first time ever.\n\nAlso in its possession are collections from the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization, once based in Alamogordo, with tens of thousands of case files \u2014 as well as collections from the UFO Research Committee of Akron, especially active in the 1950s in Ohio.\n\n\"We're literally getting these holdings in from all different points of the globe,\" Marler said.\n\nWell-documented cases beyond Roswell\n\nAcademics of unexplained phenomena have descended on the Land of Enchantment for a beloved UFO festival in Roswell. But the mythic narratives don't go dry there.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Roswell, Roswell, Roswell. That always dominates the conversation and there are better, more well-documented cases on file,\" Marler said, referring to the 1947 crash of a craft near the Southern New Mexico city. While many believe it was an extraterrestrial spacecraft, the federal government has said it was a secret military balloon aimed at detecting Soviet atomic bomb tests.\n\nMarler said many New Mexicans aren't aware of other cases within their own state.\n\nIn November of 1957, a UFO was tracked on radar and \"violated\" the perimeter of the Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, hovering around restricted sites, according to reports Marler has reviewed. He said the Rio Rancho records center has the original case file on it from \"Project Blue Book,\" the Air Force name for a project that investigated UFO reports between 1947 and 1969.\n\n\"Two Air Force personnel were observing it with binoculars at night. They described it as looking like a car standing vertically on end with a white light emanating out of the bottom. The object had the ability to hover, to rapidly accelerate, to move slowly,\" Marler said.\n\nThe Socorro incident in April 1964 \u2014 unresolved in the Air Force investigations that transpired at the time and widely reported by New Mexico news publications \u2014 was observed by local police Officer Lonnie Zamora, who claimed he witnessed two humanoids beside a shiny, egg-shaped object that later rose into the air from an arroyo as flames belched from the rising craft.\n\nMarler said he had believed the Socorro case was an isolated one. In the last year, however, he received the APRO files and came across an account published in the Santa Fe New Mexican of a similar report four days after the Socorro incident from La Madera, a remote community north of Ojo Caliente in Rio Arriba County.\n\n\"Eyewitness Recounts Passage of 'Thing' Burning in Sky,\" reads a headline in the April 28, 1964, edition of The New Mexican.\n\n\"It talks about Socorro, but it talks about a landing in La Madera ... and it described an egg-shaped object,\" Marler said. \"... New Mexico State Police [investigated and] drew a detailed diagram of the landing site and took pictures and colored photographs.\""

Even though the scientific community is yet to face any conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life, conspiracy theorists strongly believe that living beings from the distant nooks of the world have already visited planet earth.\n\nAmid all these speculations, the world is currently witnessing a new wave of unidentified flying object sightings in recent days.\n\nSocial Media Platforms Flooded with UFO Videos\n\nSocial media platforms like X and Facebook are currently being flooded with UFO sightings from countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Syria, and Australia.\n\nMost of these UFO sightings feature flying objects that are triangular in shape, which move across the skies without making any sound.\n\nAs UFO sightings rise across various nooks of the globe, conspiracy theorists strongly believe that an alien invasion is imminent.\n\nA few days back, a YouTuber had sensationally claimed that UFOs will start invading the earth on December 3, and conspiracy theorists argue that this prediction has turned true.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon and NASA have also started considering these UFO sightings very seriously, as they believe that the presence of these flying objects could threaten national security.\n\nHowever, authorities are refraining from using the word UFO, and instead they are calling these objects unidentified aerial phenomena.\n\nAre Aliens Time Travelers?\n\nAmid all these debates, Netflix, on December 8, released a documentary named Investigation Aliens.\n\nThe documentary which features George Knapp in the lead role tries to answer several questions including why aliens are visiting earth.\n\nAt the end of the documentary, which has an open-ended nature, makers suggest that UFOs and aliens which people see in the skies could be most probably time traveling humans from the future."

At least five drone-like UFOs are seen in his 50-second clip\n\nOne of the UFO drones, whose engines can be heard roaring from the ground, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly with red lights blinking at its wingtips and tail (above)\n\nBut the New Jersian who posted the new footage of these drones online maintains the answer lies within America's own classified world of black budget projects.\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' TikTok user @_bucky13 commented under his phone video of the eerie UFOs, captioned\n\n'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.'\n\n'I think they are trying to scare Russia by demonstrating some secret weapons,' he wrote.\n\nThe camera was pointed to the sky when the drones came into view.\n\n'There they are! There are more in New Jersey!,' he can be heard shouting in his handheld video \u2014 as an unsettled woman off-camera says, 'We shouldn't be outside.'\n\n'They look like an f***ing triangle! They look like a triangle,' he said in disbelief, as je spotted a triangular-shaped drone cruising into the night.\n\nA later UFO or drone seemed to hover stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect.\n\n'Are you freaking kidding me right now,' one woman can be heard saying of the craft.\n\nCommenters of UFO video joined him in his suspicion that the objects may ultimately prove to be top secret US military craft, even as the TikToker can be heard marveling in his video that 'an F-16 just flew over' in hot pursuit of the unidentified craft.\n\nAccording to one NJ local, this image depicts roughly nine of the unidentified drones flying in to the Garden State from the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday night, December 5\n\nA later UFO or drone in the new video looks like it might have hovered stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect\n\n'Looks like a military drone,' one Tik Tok user said, with another chiming in 'Definitely government made drones.'\n\nMany stated with confidence that the triangle craft was the legendary and still unconfirmed TR-3B 'Black Manta' anti-gravity spy plane, the alleged follow-up to the equally unconfirmed TR-3A, both claimed to have been made by defense contractor Northrop in the early 1990s.\n\n'Those are TR-3B government drones,' one poster said. 'Look them up, they're pretty cool.'\n\nA December 1991 cover story in Popular Mechanics was one of the first mainstream media reports to allege that the TR-3A existed as a highly advanced 'tactical reconnaissance vehicle' eyewitnesses said was 42-feet long with a 60-foot wingspan.\n\nOthers have speculated that the UFOs above New Jersey might be an update to US defense contractor Lockheed Martin\u2019s original 'Darkstar' that flew in 1996."

            "article_content": "Haunting\u2014it's not just for houses any more! We do a quick survey of haunted spots around the world.\n\nWe explore some of Wikipedia\u2019s oddities in our 6,922,857-part monthly series, Wiki Wormhole.\n\nThis week\u2019s entry: List of Reportedly Haunted Locations\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: G-g-g-ghosts! Spooks and specters have been found hanging out everywhere from theme parks to beaches and mountains, as well as your classic cemeteries and abandoned insane asylums. Wikipedia lists haunted places in no less than 45 different countries. (Several countries, including the good ol\u2019 U.S. of Apparitions, have so many haunted locations they have a separate page. For our purposes, we\u2019re going to stick to the main page.)\n\nBiggest controversy: Every supernatural claim is by nature controversial (it should go without saying that the word \u201creportedly\u201d goes before every haunting mentioned here.) But the longest controversy on the list is that of the Chase Vault in Barbados. A sealed burial vault in the cemetery of Christ Church Parish Church, it was opened in the early 19th century for a burial, and the heavy lead coffins had switched positions. While the tale is called \u201chistorically dubious,\u201d it made it into James Edward Alexander\u2019s 1833 book Transatlantic Sketches and the story persists to this day.\n\nStrangest fact: No amount of power or status can keep one\u2019s soul from roaming the night in ghostly torment. Former Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley reportedly haunts the Hotel Kurrajong, where he died in 1951. People have seen him pointing towards Old Parliament House, which is also haunted (although the building\u2019s own Wikipedia page makes no mention.) And the Pharaoh himself haunts the Pyramids of Giza (although which pharaoh isn\u2019t specified).\n\nSeveral former seats of power make the list, including Egypt\u2019s Baron Empain Palace, Myanmar\u2019s Keng Tung palace (now a hotel), Pakistan\u2019s Mohatta Palace, Lisbon\u2019s Beau-S\u00e9jour Palace, Madrid\u2019s Palace Of Linares, and the Jakarta History Museum (formerly the capitol building under Dutch colonial rule).\n\nThing we were happiest to learn: There are a lot of haunted castles. Malahide Castle in north County Dublin (the surrounding town is the shooting location for most of Bad Sisters), has no less than five ghosts: a knight killed on his wedding day, a noblewoman who was married in the castle; a jester who was in love with a woman imprisoned in the castle (who was himself murdered), a painting of a lady in white who occasionally comes to life, and the man who was (temporarily) given the castle by Cromwell, and was hanged during the Restoration.\n\nIreland also accounts for Castles Charleville, Leap, and Ross, each with their own gruesome deaths and subsequent hauntings. Most gruesomely, Zvikov Castle in the Czech Republic is supposedly so haunted that anyone who sleeps in the main tower dies within a year, and spectral dogs with burning eyes guard a tunnel under the castle.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to top Germany which, alongside Lichtenegg, Schloss Nordkirchen, and Wolfsegg, boasts Frankenstein Castle, whose imposing towers allegedly inspired Mary Shelley\u2019s novel (and no less than Ghost Hunters International determined it had \u201csignificant paranormal activity.\u201d\n\nEuropeans even exported the haunted castle overseas. A Scottish businessman built Kellie\u2019s Castle in Malaysia for his wife, who died before building was completed. It\u2019s haunted not by her, but by the workers who died during construction. New Zealand also has Larnach Castle, haunted by the wife and daughter of the original owner.\n\nThing we were unhappiest to learn: Colonialism casts a long shadow. A lot of the haunted sites are the sites of past atrocities by colonial powers: Vietnam\u2019s Ma Thi\u00ean L\u00e3nh Bridge was built by 300 prisoners, forced into labor under French rule, and a number of ghosts haunt the site. Besides the Jakarta History Museum, Indonesia is home to Toko Merah, a Dutch colonial building that was the site of a massacre, as well as torture and killings by the regime, and screaming at night can still be heard there. The Japanese (allegedly) tortured and executed Malaysian locals at what eventually became the Shih Chung Branch School, and the now-abandoned building is haunted by their ghosts.\n\nBest link to elsewhere on Wikipedia: We honestly thought parapsychology was a term made-up for the original Ghostbusters, but it\u2019s been an active discipline since philosopher Max Dessoir coined the phrase in 1889. It\u2019s the study of \u201calleged psychic phenomena,\u201d a list that includes \u201cextrasensory perception, telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, and psychometry,\u201d as well as near-death experiences, synchronicity, and apparitional experiences, and again, it\u2019s hard not to hear that list being read off in Annie Potts\u2019 most jaded tone of voice.\n\nFurther down the Wormhole: These stories are all relatively recent, compared to the folklore surrounding ghosts, which has existed as long as people have been dying and telling stories. Children have long had an entirely separate world of folklore, concerning the consequences of stepping on a crack, and whether or not Batman smells. Their mysterious culture also includes children\u2019s games, which recent generations of adults seem loath to let go of. One such game, pencil fighting, is an unlikely candidate to spawn an adult league, but here we are. There isn\u2019t quite enough in the world of extreme pencil fighting to justify a full-length column, so we\u2019ll wrap up the year with a bunch of short topics before resuming our regular format in 2025."

She was one of a kind, truly an iconic actor, but I'm so humbled and grateful. Thank you.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that Sridevi struck a resemblance with a beloved Pakistani actor. The English Vinglish actor starred in 2017 Indian film Mom as Devki Sabarwal, the lionhearted mother of Arya Sabarwal, who was played by our very own Sajal Ali. Now it seems that her enchanting visage has found a new match among local stars.\n\nSonya's beauty is also not a thing to be downplayed. In a recent Instagram post, she flaunted a striking blue sari as a wedding season look. Waxing lyrical in the caption, she wrote, \"Safe for these fluttering eyelashes, the heart doesn't reside anywhere else.\"\n\nWhile the Azaadi actor sports modesty off-camera, she continues to make strides on the big and small screens. Going back to her horror-mystery roots, she is set to star in Pakistani film Deemak alongside other famed actors, such as Faysal Quraishi, Javed Sheikh, Samina Peerzada, and Bushra Ansari.\n\nThe script is written by horror author Ayesha Muzzafar, or abusjinns on Instagram, who is known for her true-to-life paranormal stories. Deemak's trailer also claims inspiration from real-life events.\n\n\"Ladies, gentlemen, and jinns, my very first script is finally coming to life. The journey of creating Deemak with Wah Wah Productions and Rafay Rashdi has been nothing short of thrilling. Starring Pakistan's most celebrated actors, this dark, gripping, and deeply unsettling tale will be infesting your screens very soon,\" Ayesha wrote on Instagram."

Even the finely crafted armour scales from the tomb of Liu Sheng, a prince of the Western Han empire (202 BC \u2013 AD9), were 2cm to 3cm wide \u2013 much larger than those from Liu He\u2019s armour. Liu Sheng\u2019s tomb was discovered in northern Hebei province in 1968."

            "article_content": "Is mathematics a discovery or an invention?\n\nThe answers to this question are an important part of the philosophy of mathematics. To answer it, philosophers would like to know whether mathematics is a natural part of this world that existed before humans discovered and comprehended it or if mathematics was invented by humans.\n\nIn this discussion, experts have developed many different ideas. A particularly popular one is mathematical realism: according to this view, mathematics is real irrespective of whether there is a human mind to comprehend it. In other words, it stipulates that human minds discovered mathematics rather than creating it.\n\nThere has been some support from evolution for this view. Insects called cicadas live underground but emerge every few years to eat foot, reproduce, and then die. This year, three broods of cicadas emerged at the same time: one with a 13-year cycle, one with a 17-year cycle, and one with a seven-year cycle. It\u2019s the first such event in 1,547 years.\n\nSeven, 13, and 17 are all prime numbers, and some scientists believe evolution opted for them to avoid predators that emerge from underground to hunt cicadas at periodic intervals. By keeping their emergence cycle to a prime number of years, cicadas have a better chance of avoiding the predators\u2019 more predictable cycles.\n\nThere are many types of realism as well, including Platonic, mathematicism, and logicism. Other, alternative positions on the nature of mathematics include structuralism, fictionalism, and social constructivism."

Learn More.\n\nOpenAI awarded a $1 million grant to a Duke University team of researchers seeking to explore AI algorithms capable of predicting people\u2019s moral judgment. The grant invests in academic research into \u201cAI morality\u201d as debates on the ethical use of artificial intelligence continue to gain steam in public discourse. Duke has been researching the use of AI to aid people in exercising ethical decisions, producing resources on ethics involving the latest AI technologies.\n\nThe study, \u201cMaking Moral AI,\u201d is being conducted by Duke\u2019s Moral Attitudes and Decisions Lab (MADLAB) and led by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, professor of practical ethics and the project\u2019s principal investigator. Co-investigator Jana Schaich Borg of the Social Science Research Institute joins him on the project.\n\nMADLAB is an interdisciplinary laboratory designed to understand various factors that shape and influence people\u2019s \u201cmoral attitudes, decisions, and judgments.\u201d Researchers have been trying to understand the role of AI and how it can be used as a \u201cmoral GPS\u201d to help people make better judgments guided by ethical standards and traditions, drawing on \u201ccomputer science, data science, philosophy, economics, game theory, psychology, and neuroscience.\u201d\n\nAbout the OpenAI Grant\n\nOpenAI\u2019s grant will be used to \u201cdevelop algorithms that can predict human moral judgments in scenarios involving conflicts among morally relevant features in medicine, law, and business,\u201d according to a Duke press release. Information about the research grant has not been publicized, but it would be a good start for OpenAI to invest in such an effort. Ethics is highly nuanced. It\u2019s still a long shot for current technologies to grasp the nuances of moral judgments\u2014especially when human emotion also plays a crucial role.\n\nAI models are trained to calculate and compute data and statistics. Large language models mostly rely on patterns in language and reasoning to generate predictions. Various fields are involved in morality research, including philosophy, sociocultural studies, and psychology. Combining these disciplines with AI, computer science, and data science would be an enormous task. It also takes time to fully integrate social sciences and philosophy insights into AI algorithms.\n\nRead our guide to navigating AI\u2019s ethical challenges or our look at the ethics of generative AI models to learn more."

            "article_content": "At the heart of this cosmic mystery lies the Higgs field, a fundamental component of our universe that gives particles their mass. However, this field isn\u2019t as stable as we once thought. Scientists have discovered that the Higgs field could potentially \u201cbubble,\u201d creating pockets of altered reality where nothing could exist.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher, Lucien Heurtier, explains : \u201cThe Higgs field isn\u2019t likely to be in the lowest possible energy state it could be in. That means it could theoretically change its state, dropping to a lower energy state in a certain location.\u201d\n\nThis revelation has profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos. If the Higgs field were to shift to a lower energy state, it would dramatically alter the laws of physics within these \u201cbubbles.\u201d In such an environment :\n\nElectron masses would suddenly change\n\nParticle interactions would be altered\n\nProtons and neutrons would disintegrate\n\nLife as we know it would cease to exist\n\nThe paradox deepens when we consider the early universe and the hypothetical existence of primordial black holes. These minuscule black holes, potentially as small as a gram, are believed to have formed during the universe\u2019s inflationary period, mere moments after the Big Bang.\n\nPrimordial black holes : the universe\u2019s self-destruct button ?\n\nThe research team argues that if primordial black holes existed as current models suggest, they should have triggered widespread \u201cbubbling\u201d of the Higgs field. This cosmic chain reaction would have prevented the formation of any stable matter in the universe. Yet, here we are, contemplating our own existence.\n\nThis paradox presents scientists with two possible explanations :\n\nOur current models of primordial black holes are incorrect and need to be discarded There are fundamental aspects of the Higgs field\u2019s behavior that we don\u2019t yet understand\n\nThe implications of this study extend far beyond theoretical physics. It challenges our understanding of the universe\u2019s origins and stability, forcing us to reconsider established theories. This paradox is reminiscent of other unexpected discoveries that have baffled astronomers, pushing the boundaries of our cosmic knowledge.\n\nUnraveling the cosmic tapestry : new frontiers in physics\n\nAs scientists grapple with this existential paradox, new avenues of research are emerging. The quest to understand the universe\u2019s existence has led to innovative experiments and theoretical frameworks. One such breakthrough is the quantum cat experiment that set a record by surviving 1,400 seconds, pushing the boundaries of quantum superposition.\n\nThese advancements in quantum physics may hold the key to unraveling the Higgs field mystery. By exploring the behavior of particles at the quantum level, scientists hope to gain insights into the stability of the Higgs field and its interactions with other cosmic phenomena.\n\nThe study of cosmic paradoxes extends beyond the realm of physics. Recent research has even challenged our understanding of what happens in the brain after death, defying all logic. These discoveries highlight the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines and the need for a holistic approach to understanding our universe.\n\nRedefining reality : the impact on scientific thought\n\nThe revelation that the universe shouldn\u2019t exist according to current models has profound implications for scientific thought. It challenges researchers to question established theories and explore new paradigms. This shift in thinking could lead to revolutionary discoveries across various fields, from astrophysics to quantum mechanics.\n\nTo illustrate the potential impact of this paradigm shift, consider the following table :\n\nScientific Field Current Understanding Potential Paradigm Shift Cosmology Big Bang Theory Multi-dimensional universe models Particle Physics Standard Model Unified field theories Quantum Mechanics Copenhagen Interpretation Many-worlds interpretation Astrophysics Dark Matter/Energy Modified gravity theories\n\nAs scientists continue to probe the mysteries of the universe, unexpected discoveries are reshaping our understanding of reality. From new types of materials that could change our lives to fundamental questions about existence itself, the frontiers of science are expanding rapidly.\n\nThe paradox of the universe\u2019s existence serves as a humbling reminder of how much we have yet to learn. It invites us to embrace uncertainty, question our assumptions, and continue exploring the cosmic tapestry that surrounds us. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the Higgs field and primordial black holes, we may uncover truths that reshape our understanding of reality itself."

            "article_content": "The latest Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics just dropped, and it is filled with goodies ranging from new missions to plans for space weather.\n\nThe report comes from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and it outlines top priorities for space agencies and affiliated institutions in better understanding the solar system in the next decade. The report draws on 450 papers from the science community as well as other events including presentations and town halls.\n\nDecadal surveys are important; they outline science objectives for a wide array of scientists. In 2021, the academies outlined finding Earth-like exoplanets, understanding the universe\u2019s densest objects, and improving understanding of the birth and growth of galaxies as top astronomical priorities.\n\nThe following year, the report dedicated to planetary science and astrobiology concluded that a Uranus probe should be the highest priority mission. Last year, a report from the academies put a sustained human presence off-Earth on the docket.\n\nThis year\u2019s report covered the gamut of solar and space physics, including how to better track the dynamic environment of our solar system and better understand the star at its heart.\n\nThe report called for NASA to pursue a mission that would launch a constellation of satellites that would observe the space environment near Earth and a spacecraft that would image the Sun at its poles. The report identified the National Science Foundation\u2019s Next Generation Global Oscillations Network, a solar observatory network, as the highest-priority large construction project.\n\nFuture modeling of space weather systems should also make use of artificial intelligence, according to the report. Specifically, machine learning-driven models of the surface of the Sun could better anticipate eruptions from the surface of the star, and data assimilation could be done swiftly by AI programs, hastening the pace of discovery. The report also recommended that the NSF develop a strategic plan for space weather , that NOAA establish a program for it, and partner with the Department of Defense to develop predictive space weather models. The report also called for NASA to grow the spaceflight element of its Heliophysics Space Weather program; the Parker Solar Probe\u2019s dive into the Sun comes to mind, as an ambitious endeavor that yielded new insights into space weather.\n\n\u201cLack of progress in solar and space physics over the next decade could have devastating consequences to society, in part because it would inhibit our ability to predict and mitigate against potentially harmful space weather impacts,\u201d said committee co-chair Stephen Fuselier, acting vice president of the Southwest Research Institute\u2019s space science division, in an academies release.\n\n\u201cWhile making substantive progress will require modest additional investments from the government, research into these areas is of paramount importance,\u201d Fuselier added. \u201cThis report helps provide a window into the future of the field and safeguard a growing range of industries here on Earth, and enables humanity to become a true space-faring civilization.\u201d\n\nSpace weather is a dynamic phenomenon that even affects those of us on Earth; our planet was hit by several intense geomagnetic storms this year, causing auroras around the world and some electronic disruptions. But in space, such weather events can be severe for equipment that, albeit shielded, is not within the relatively safe cocoon of our planet\u2019s magnetosphere.\n\n\u201cThe solar and space physics field is at a pivotal point right now, and we have the opportunity in the coming years to pursue some really exciting science\u2014both for science\u2019s sake and to achieve major improvements to our understanding of things like space weather,\u201d said Robyn Millan, an astronomer at Dartmouth College and co-chair of the committee that wrote the report, in an academies release.\n\nAs we Earthlings ramp up exploration of our solar system (and, dare I say, beyond?), it\u2019s crucial for governing bodies to outline the types of missions and the funding required to take those ambitious next steps sooner rather than later. The report provides a north star for those goals, and gives the public something to get excited about."

The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a New Yorker and a staunch believer in public transportation. For most of my life, I never owned a car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, all the forms of public transportation I used daily were unsafe.\n\nI had to think about how I could transport my then-five-year-old and how I would reach family members if something terrible happened.\n\nI considered getting a car for the first time. I made this list: It was written in Sharpie on a piece of grid paper, and it said, \"New?\" \"Used?\" \"EV???\" However, I had to immediately eliminate electric vehicles from my potential options because, in 2020, there was no accessible place to charge them in Brooklyn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realized there was a lack of infrastructure to transition to EV cars and that was the seed idea for my company.\n\nAlthough my career was in design, I pivoted and cofounded a climate tech startup called It's Electric in 2022. We're focused on scaling electric vehicle charging in densely populated cities.\n\nWe're now a company of 10 people and we've received $11.8 million in funding and grants. Uber invested in our seed round. My best advice is to find simple solutions to big pain points and prove your work with receipts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe found a simple solution for electric charging\n\nWhen we started building It's Electric in 2021, my cofounder and I conducted research to determine what was preventing EV chargers from being deployed quickly and at scale in US cities.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIn a city like London, there are a lot of lampposts that have been retrofitted into curbside chargers because they can handle 220 to 240 volts of electricity. In the US, the power feeds in our lamposts are typically much lower, at 110 volts.\n\nIf we wanted to have lamppost chargers, we'd need to upgrade the utility main and corresponding interconnection agreement, load analysis, transformer, submeter, and customer connection box.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe discovered that one asset in cities, that has plenty of power ready to go, is buildings, which we can use to power public chargers.\n\nIf a library, home, or commercial building agrees to power a public charger, we share revenue with that building to give them passive income as an incentive. It's a very simple idea. We say it's not deep tech, it's shallow tech.\n\nRunning a pilot helped get investors on board\n\nOur business started with just us two founders, but after we raised a $2.2 million pre-seed round in May 2023, we hired our first two employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring our pre-seed stage, multiple investors told me that our idea was so simple that it must not work, or surely someone else was already doing it. We had to prove that a simple solution could be effective.\n\nOne way we did that was by getting our pilot off the ground in 2023.\n\nWe secured our partnership with Hyundai after winning their EV Open Innovation Challenge. Winners were selected based on their potential to expand market access to electric vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe knew we needed to test in the real world and in a notoriously hard-to-open city. So we approached the New York City Economic Development Corporation to ask if we could pilot our technology on their buildings in the Brooklyn Army Terminal. After much work, this became our first pilot and was crucial to landing investment.\n\nOur work on this pilot was so successful that EDC launched a brand new program based on our pilot.\n\nHave receipts and discuss your wins\n\nOur pilot demonstrated that our solution offsets emissions, and we could collect data from the demo to show it was scalable, low-cost, and quick to install.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pilot meant I could provide investors with proven results. We'd gone beyond what investors expected of us, which placated their queries and also attracted investors we hadn't yet spoken to.\n\nHaving a small-scale demonstration of your solution is more helpful in pitching to a large corporation than trying to sell a concept. It meant we were able to demonstrate a Series A level of progress at a pre-seed level.\n\nSo many investors said, \"If it is so simple and such a good idea, then why aren't others already doing it?\" My answer was, \"Because no one else is doing it, we are the first.\" My advice to founders is to be tenacious but make sure you have the receipts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe talked about our wins, such as prize nominations and media acknowledgments, to show investors that, by the jury of peers, our solution is winning.\n\nUber invested in our seed round\n\nIn July 2024, we closed our $6.5 million seed round, which was co-led by a Nordic fund, Failup Ventures, and Uber. Now, we're a team of 10.\n\nOur involvement with Uber began when we met representatives from the company at a conference. Everyone thinks of companies like Uber as big corporate giants, but we started our partnership with them by chance. It wasn't a sales or business meeting; it was just two optimistic people working in transportation who had a great conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA big challenge to Uber's zero-emissions goal is that Uber drivers live in cities and don't have garages, so it's really hard to charge electric vehicles. We provided a cheap, fast solution for urban drivers to charge electric cars. Uber needed more drivers to adopt electric cars to reach its goals, and we pitched ourselves as that stepping stone. A series of productive conversations helped us build this partnership.\n\nHaving Uber support our solution has been a great validation for our startup. It's also meant we've had access to smart people on their team to understand different policies and how we can help meet city goals.\n\nMy advice for founders who want to develop relationships with established companies is to try to solve problems for other people. Don't say you want a partnership because of what it can do for your startup, but put yourself out there as the problem-solver for a larger corporation. You want to find their pain point and point out that there isn't a solution that's already in the market."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks that are taking Wall Street by storm.\n\nIt seems that major tech companies in Silicon Valley are forging relationships with the defense industry these days. In the latest news, prominent artificial intelligence company OpenAI has entered a partnership with Anduril, a defense startup that produces missiles, drones, and software for the United States military.\n\nREAD NOW: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 AI News Investors Shouldn\u2019t Miss.\n\nThe companies said that this partnership will emphasize on the improvement of the United States' counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) as well as their ability to deal with potentially lethal aerial threats in real-time. The CUAS will enable defense against drone strikes by detecting and intercepting them while they are airborne.\n\nAccording to Brian Schimpf, cofounder and CEO of Anduril, OpenAI\u2019s AI models will be used to improve systems used for air defense. The technology will be used to \u201cassess drone threats more quickly and accurately, giving operators the information they need to make better decisions while staying out of harm\u2019s way\u201d, revealed a former OpenAI employee.\n\n\u201cOpenAI builds AI to benefit as many people as possible, and supports US-led efforts to ensure the technology upholds democratic values\u2026 Our partnership with Anduril will help ensure OpenAI technology protects US military personnel, and will help the national security community understand and responsibly use this technology to keep our citizens safe and free.\u201d\n\nLast month, OpenAI rival Anthropic also entered a partnership with a famous defense contractor to provide \u201cUS intelligence and defense agencies\u201d access to its AI models. Regardless of its competitors' actions, OpenAI shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. After months of tender offers and a soaring valuation, the company has reached a new record of 300 million weekly active users. The announcement was made by Sam Altman during an appearance at The New York Times\u2019 Dealbook Conference on Wednesday, December 4th. The company is reportedly targeting 1 billion active users by next year.\n\nThese strategies aim to strengthen OpenAI's position against competitors Anthropic and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, the latter of which Sam Altman considers a \u201cfierce competitor\u201d. Besides that, it is also striving to gain a larger slice of the generative AI market, which may top $1 trillion in revenue by the next decade. Altman also revealed that his company hasn\u2019t asked investors not to invest in its competitors. However, those who decide to wouldn\u2019t have access to OpenAI\u2019s \u201cinformation rights,\u201d like the company\u2019s roadmap and other materials.\n\nStory Continues"

Photograph: Bakr Alkasem/AFP via Getty Images\n\nA coalition of opposition groups in Syria, headed by the Islamist faction Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has upended Syria\u2019s civil war after a long stalemate. Their lightning offensive, taking over several key cities in the space of days, is the most direct challenge to president Bashar al-Assad\u2019s power in years and may signal the end of his 24-year rule.\n\nThe Syrian civil war started 13 years ago, during the Arab Spring, and escalated into a bloody, multifaceted conflict involving domestic opposition groups, extremist factions and international powers, including the United States, Iran and Russia. More than 500,000 Syrians have died, and millions more have fled their homes.\n\nWhat is the situation on the ground?\n\nIn just over a week, Syrian rebel forces seized much of Syria\u2019s northwest from the government in a fast-moving attack. First, the rebels seized Syria\u2019s largest city, Aleppo, then days later blazed through Hama and the strategic city of Homs. On Sunday, they reached Syria\u2019s capital, Damascus.\n\nWho is fighting?\n\nThe Syrian government, led by Assad, was central to the protracted and devastating civil war that began in 2011. Assad, who took power in 2000, is part of the family that has run Syria since a 1970 coup. They are Alawites, a minority sect that is an offshoot of Shiite Islam.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nSyria's president Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma al-Assad at the opening ceremony of the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China. Photograph: Philip Fong/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAssad initially portrayed himself as a modern reformist, but he responded to peaceful protests during the Arab Spring with brutal crackdowns, sparking a nationwide uprising.\n\nAfter several years of war, the Assad government clawed back much of the territory it lost to rebels with the help of Iran, Russia, and Lebanon\u2019s Hizbullah militia. But those allies have recently been decimated or distracted by other conflicts.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), whose name means Organisation for the Liberation of the Levant, began to form at the beginning of Syria\u2019s civil war, when jihadis formed the Nusra Front to fight pro-Assad forces with hundreds of insurgent and suicide attacks.\n\nThe group had early links to the Islamic State group, and then to al-Qaeda. But by mid-2016, the Nusra Front tried to shed its extremist roots, banding together with several other factions to establish HTS. The United States and other western countries still consider it a terrorist group.\n\nThe group\u2019s leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has said his primary goal is to \u201cliberate Syria from this oppressive regime\u201d. He has tried to gain legitimacy by providing services to residents in his stronghold of Idlib.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) jihadist group's chief Abu Mohamed al-Jolani (L) checks the damage following an earthquake in the village of Besnaya in Idlib province. Photograph: Omar Haj Kadour/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPublicly, US officials have been cautious about HTS. But inside the US government, some officials believe the group\u2019s turn toward pragmatism is genuine, and that its leaders know they cannot realise aspirations to join or lead the Syrian government if the group is seen as a jihadi one.\n\nKurdish Forces, from a Syrian ethnic minority, became the United States\u2019 main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces. After the extremist group was largely defeated, Kurdish-led forces consolidated control over towns in the northeast, expanding an autonomous region they had built there. But Kurdish fighters still had to contend with their long-time enemy, Turkey, which regards them as being linked to a Kurdish separatist insurgency.\n\nThere are also many other Syrian militias fighting with their own agendas and allegiances.\n\nAre foreign powers involved?\n\nSince the beginning of the civil war, Turkey\u2019s military has launched several military interventions across the border into Syria, mostly against Syrian Kurdish-led forces. Turkey now effectively controls a zone along Syria\u2019s northern border.\n\nTurkey also supports factions such as the Syrian National Army, a coalition of armed Syrian opposition groups. Analysts say it probably gave tacit approval to the offensive led by HTS.\n\nProtesters outside the Turkish embassy in Tehran, Iran denounced Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s support of Syrian rebels and Israeli prime minister Binyamin Neanyahu's treatment of Gaza. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday issued a qualified approval of the rebel advance. \u201cIdlib, Hama, Homs, and the target, of course, is Damascus,\u201d he told reporters in Istanbul, according to Turkish state media. \u201cThe opposition\u2019s march continues. Our wish is that this march in Syria continues without incident.\u201d\n\nThroughout Syria\u2019s civil war, Russia has been one of Assad\u2019s most loyal foreign backers, sending Russian troops to support his forces and jets to bomb his enemies. It has maintained a strategic military presence in Syria with air and naval bases, which it uses to support military operations in the region.\n\nBecause of the grinding war of attrition in Ukraine, analysts say Russia has been unable to support Syria\u2019s government as forcefully as it has in the past. Russian air strikes that attempted to slow the rebel advance have been relatively sparse.\n\nSyria is a core part of Iran\u2019s \u201cAxis of Resistance,\u201d a network of countries and groups that includes Hizbullah, Palestinian militant group Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen that hopes to destroy Israel and reduce American influence in the Middle East.\n\nIran smuggles weapons to Hizbullah across Iraq and Syria. Iran and Hizbullah have repaid the favour by sending thousands of militants to fight on Assad\u2019s side during the civil war. On Friday, Iran began to evacuate its military commanders and personnel from Syria, according to regional officials and three Iranian officials, in a sign of its inability to help Assad hold power.\n\nThe US role in the Syrian civil war has shifted several times. The Obama administration initially supported opposition groups in their uprising against the government, providing weapons and training, with limited effect.\n\nAfter the rise of the Islamic State group in 2014, US forces fought the terrorist group with air strikes and assistance to Kurdish forces, and then stayed in northeastern Syria to prevent a resurgence. In 2019, then-president Donald Trump withdrew many of those forces, but the US still maintains about 900 troops, based in Kurdish-controlled oil-drilling areas in the northeast and a garrison in the southeast near Syria\u2019s borders with Iraq and Jordan.\n\nIsrael\u2019s military activities in Syria have been mostly focused on air strikes against Hizbullah and Iranian targets, especially senior military personnel, weapons production facilities and the transport corridor that Iran uses to send weapons to Hizbullah.\n\nFighters for the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham make their way through a trench on the front lines near the town of Maaret al-Nasaan, Idlib Province, Syria. Photograph: Ivor Prickett/New York Times\n\nAn Enduring Conflict\n\nThe Syrian war began in 2011 with a peaceful uprising against the government and spiralled into a complex conflict involving armed rebels, extremists and others.\n\nThe conflict began when Syrians rose up peacefully against the government of Assad. The protests were met a violent crackdown, while communities took up arms to defend themselves. civil war ensued.\n\nAmid the chaos, Syria\u2019s ethnic Kurdish minority took up arms and gradually took territory it saw as its own. The Islamic State group seized parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014 and declared that territory its \u201ccaliphate,\u201d further destabilising the region.\n\nAssad has received vital support from Iran and Russia, as well as Hizbullah. The rebels were backed by the US and oil-rich Arab states such as Saudi Arabia. Turkey also intervened to stop the advance of Kurdish militias.\n\nThe war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Forces loyal to Assad have committed by far the most atrocities. The regime has turned to chemical weapons, barrel bombs and starvation to force Syrians into submission.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n2024 The New York Times Company"

Its shares were trading up 12.1% at 13.2 euros by 1445 GMT.\n\nReason for the buyout talks\n\nThe buyout talks come as some minority shareholders, including AJ Investments, have been pushing for either a take-private or a sale of Ubisoft to a strategic investor amid the stock price plunge, as previously reported.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares fell to their lowest level in the last decade in September after it cut its outlook on weaker-than-expected sales and postponed the launch of \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed Shadows.\u201d.\n\nThis week it announced it would discontinue development of its gaming title XDefiant and, as a consequence, close its production studios in San Francisco and Osaka and ramp down production in Sydney.\n\nUbisoft is run by the Guillemot family, which owns 15% of the firm, followed by Tencent, which owns just under 10%, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe family held about 20.5% of Ubisoft\u2019s net voting rights while Tencent owned 9.2% as of the end of April, as per the firm\u2019s latest annual report."

A CR that has been funding the government since FY25 started Oct. 1 expires Dec. 20.\n\nRepublican leaders of the Senate and House Ag committees have been pushing to attach to the CR assistance for farmers who have been affected by a downturn in commodity markets as well as aid for producers who lost crops or livestock to hurricanes and other natural disasters. The White House has asked Congress for nearly $100 billion in disaster assistance, including $24 billion for USDA.\n\n\u201cEvery bit that we put off causes economic harm for the agriculture industry that's been impacted, really across the board, not just by the natural disasters, but just the economic challenges,\u201d said House Ag Chairman Glenn \u201cGT\u201d Thompson, R-Pa.\n\nAs of late last week, no decisions had been by congressional leaders in terms of what is going to be attached to the farm bill extension, Thompson said. \u201cThere\u2019s some tough decisions to be made,\u201d he said.\n\nLawmakers from Georgia and Florida, two states hard hit by hurricanes, haven\u2019t given up on getting disaster aid included in year-end legislation.\n\nIn a letter to leaders of the Senate Appropriations Committee on Friday, Sens. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and Rick Scott, R-Fla.. said \u201cboth of our states have been heavily impacted by natural disasters over the last two years, leaving farmers and ranchers with decimated crops and wrangled infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe letter goes on, \u201cAs you negotiate a disaster supplemental package, we urge you to include sufficient funding to meet the needs of producers in our states.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Rita El Khoury / Android Authority\n\nWhen was the last time you felt your smartphone really couldn\u2019t cope? I\u2019m running last year\u2019s Pixel 8 Pro \u2014 hardly a benchmark topper \u2014 as my daily driver, and just as silky smooth as the more powerful ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro I\u2019ve been using on the side. But even before that, I struggle to recall the last time an app jerked and juddered into life. Outside of a few niche use cases, smartphone power has been bountiful for a few years now, but to jump up another level, modern manufacturing is making it more and more expensive but with few real-world benefits. We might have already passed the point of diminishing returns, but we\u2019re also paying more and more for the privilege.\n\nThis year\u2019s Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite is a prime example; it offers significant leaps in benchmark performance but is said to be considerably more expensive than its predecessor. Likewise, MediaTek\u2019s Dimensity 9400 commands a higher price tag too, yet you\u2019ll struggle to tell a phone packing these chips apart from last year\u2019s model when it\u2019s in hand. Money thrown at higher benchmark scores could be spent on better cameras, newer battery tech, or anything else on your wishlist. Returning to the ROG, the baseline model has dropped the telephoto camera, no doubt to keep up with the spiraling costs of top-tier performance.\n\nWith reports that the next-gen Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 will be \u201csignificantly\u201d more expensive once again, something has to give; be it higher price tags or sacrificing other key specs. But is that a trade-off any of us are really willing to make?\n\nAre you willing to pay more for faster performance? 1041 votes Yes, I'll keep paying for the best. 9 % Only if I can actually use the gains. 33 % No, current phones are fast enough. 59 %\n\nI\u2019m all for extra performance, of course, but there has to be an opportunity to use it. There\u2019s no point in splashing out on a sports car to plod around the inner-city, after all. For smartphones, you don\u2019t need the latest and greatest chip to sail through your daily apps or even hit 60fps in demanding Android games. A further 20% or greater boost to peak smartphone performance feels academic at this point; it\u2019s just not going to make one bit of difference to virtually every use case you could name. There\u2019s more to high-end chips, of course, but you\u2019d struggle to make the case that mainstream flagships are hinging their sales in niches like Wi-Fi 7 or barely finalized 5G technical releases, either.\n\nA further 20% boost to peak performance feels academic at this point.\n\nWhat these future high-end smartphones need is a compelling use case to leverage all this extra performance headroom. And no, I don\u2019t think AI is the answer there. Consumers are lukewarm on it so far and today\u2019s features run pretty well on modern and even slightly older hardware already.\n\nHandheld gaming feels like an underutilized option \u2014 today\u2019s flagships far outpace the beloved Nintendo Switch. But unless you\u2019re willing to work around with Winlator or similar, you\u2019re not playing modern AAA titles on your phone, while most classic emulators will run on a potato. Barring a major change in the fundamentals of Android/Linux and Arm gaming, future mobile GPUs are destined to remain underutilized.\n\nThat leaves the oft-promised but never truly realized pocket PC. I could certainly see myself using my handset for work if I could run a proper Linux desktop from my phone. Blowing up my docs and messaging apps on the big screen is already possible to an extent, but letting my phone\u2019s processor rip at full tilt for image editing or managing my vast media library falls far short of a PC-like experience. With limitations like five concurrent apps and meager software options, Samsung Dex \u2014 the clear market leader here \u2014 has never quite lived up to that potential. I\u2019m keen to see if Samsung can level up Dex with the more powerful Galaxy S25 series, but we\u2019ve not heard anything about it in the new One UI 7 beta, and Linux on Dex is long buried.\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s hope that the meshing of Android and ChromeOS or the potential of running Debian apps on your phone as soon as Android 16 could open the door to a broader range of software and use cases that could stretch tomorrow\u2019s high-end chips. Certainly, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is more than powerful enough to serve as a high-end tablet or even a mid-tier work laptop, where photo editing or compiling code could really make use of those beefy CPU cores. Strangely enough, though, we haven\u2019t seen flagship mobile silicon making its way over to Chromebooks, which remains a predominantly AMD and Intel affair. And that points to another hurdle: Linux software support for Arm processors is passable, but even proper desktop support wouldn\u2019t mean we can finally run our Steam library on our smartphones. But it would be a significant step towards catching that all-important developer\u2019s attention.\n\nExtra performance comes at higher and higher costs.\n\nStill, big performance really needs a big display to make use of it, so even more smartphones would also need to embrace DisplayPort over USB-C to make the pocketable PC a real thing. There are a lot of moving parts, then, which makes it seem unlikely we\u2019ll be making the most of these powerhouse chipsets anytime soon. With that in mind, there\u2019s little point in buying a phone for future-proof performance.\n\nInstead, perhaps Qualcomm\u2019s rumored Snapdragon 8s Elite and other upper-mid-range chips will be more than sufficient for everyday smartphone performance and better suit our readers\u2019 preferences for longer battery life and more affordable smartphones. Better battery life and a lid on prices constantly poll as your two most desirable features of a modern smartphone, and the features over power idea certainly seems to work well enough for Google\u2019s Pixel. Whether other flagship OEMs will see things the same way is probably much less likely, but Redmi/Xiaomi\u2019s general manager was surveying fans earlier this year as to whether they wanted to keep following \u201cupstream\u201d costs or make phones more affordable. So, consumers aren\u2019t the only ones pondering the cost/benefit ratio of modern hardware.\n\nThe ChromeOS merger and running Debian apps on Android hints at future powerhouse use cases, but we'll have to see.\n\nThe days of a new phone feeling notably snappier than your previous model have been long gone anyway, yet it seems odd to be turning my nose up at overkill performance that we could barely imagine a decade ago. But it\u2019s the compromises, particularly in terms of squeezing product costs, that are presenting the industry with a tough choice. If there are compromises to be made, I\u2019d much rather take the more expensive cameras, cutting-edge battery cells, a no-compromise approach to build quality, or just a freeze on prices over the extra performance I cannot realize.\n\nUntil a compelling new use case comes along that makes my current smartphone splutter, I\u2019m increasingly convinced manufacturers should take their foot off the throttle a little and settle for more modest yearly gains. They could even start really focusing on other hugely important and popular aspects of a great smartphone, like better battery life.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

            "article_content": "Machine learning played a prominent role at Amazon Web Services' (AWS) annual in-house exhibition re:Invent \u2013, including when it comes to new hardware. The focus was on the EC2 UltraServers powered by Trainium2 chips and EC2 instances, which are now available. According to AWS, the new Trn2 instances offer 20.8 petaflops of computing power per instance and an up to 40 percent better price-performance ratio compared to the GPU-based EC2 P5 instances.\n\nAnzeige\n\nA Trn2 UltraServer consists of four Trn2 instances that are connected to each other via a NeuronLink connection. This architecture is designed to scale computing power up to 83.2 petaflops to reduce training and inference times for the world's largest AI models. Models with up to one trillion parameters could thus be processed with improved latency.\n\n\"Project Rainier\" for AI clusters\n\nAWS also announced \"Project Rainier\", which combines hundreds of Trainium2 UltraServers into an EC2 UltraCluster, enabling an increase in cluster size compared to existing solutions. These UltraClusters are used in organizations such as Anthropic to train AI models. Anthropic uses them, for example, to optimize Claude models for Amazon Bedrock on Trainium2. This infrastructure should enable customers to efficiently train models with trillions of parameters and use them in real time.\n\nRead also Amazon releases new AI model family \u2013 Nova\n\nAWS emphasized that it is not enough to increase the size of clusters to improve performance. Instead, the new architecture of Trainium2 UltraServers improves data distribution and resource allocation. This reduces the overall training time without encountering traditional network limits.\n\nNew instances with Nvidia Blackwell and outlook\n\nIn addition to the Trainium2 solutions, AWS presented the EC2 P6 instances. They are based on the next generation of Blackwell GPUs from Nvidia. Compared to the current generation, AWS promises up to 2.5 times higher performance and optimization specifically for compute-intensive generative AI applications. AWS sees the P6 instances primarily for applications that require fast response times and high scalability.\n\nAnzeige\n\nAWS has also already announced the upcoming Trainium3 chip as the successor to Trainium2. This will be manufactured using a 3-nanometer process. Compared to its predecessor, it is said to be more energy-efficient and four times more powerful. This will allow customers to iterate models faster and use them in real time. Trainium3 is expected to be available in later versions of the UltraServer.\n\n(nie)"

            "article_content": "The storied Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI -0.28%) is one of the oldest and most reputable stock market indexes. The 30 Dow components are industry-leading blue chip stocks representing their respective stock market sectors. But the Dow has undergone major transformations over the last five years.\n\nThe two latest changes came this year, with Amazon (AMZN 2.94%)replacing Walgreens Boots Alliance in February and Nvidia (NVDA -1.81%) replacing Intel in November.\n\nAmazon and Nvidia wasted no time proving their value in modernizing the Dow, with both components outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.25%) and Dow indexes year to date. But investors care more about where a company is going than where it has been.\n\nHere's why Nvidia stands out as a better buy than Amazon for 2025, and some factors to consider when buying leading growth stocks at all-time highs.\n\nSucceeding together\n\nBefore getting too far into our discussion, it's worth mentioning that Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a major customer of Nvidia. So there's certainly a scenario where both companies thrive and post market-beating gains, or slowdowns at AWS trickle down to Nvidia.\n\nOn Dec. 3, Nvidia announced that its latest tech, including its Blackwell architecture for generative artificial intelligence (AI), was coming to AWS. A new computing platform available through AWS Marketplace Private Offers will allow enterprises to build AI models with the support of Nvidia experts. AWS has developed liquid-to-chip cooling across its data centers with a new solution that offers air- and liquid-cooling capabilities for powerful AI supercomputer systems like the Nvidia GB200 NVL72.\n\nNvidia is the undisputed leader in chips for hyperscalers, and AWS is the leading hyperscaler -- commanding roughly the same market share as Microsoft Cloud and Alphabet-owned Google Cloud combined. According to a Nov. 1 report from Synergy Research Group, AWS holds a 31% market share over the cloud market compared to 20% for Microsoft and 13% for Google.\n\nHowever, AWS doesn't have nearly the dominance in cloud as Nvidia does in chips for data centers.\n\nThe better business model\n\nOver its history, Amazon has been a remarkably flexible company, branching into different end markets and enduring several periods of economic uncertainty. The company's network effects, leading cloud position, growing e-commerce business, and combination of diversification and disruption are valid reasons to buy Amazon stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\nAWS' operating income comprised 62% of Amazon's total operating income for the nine months ending Sept. 30, 2024. Compared to the same period last year, AWS revenue increased by $12.22 billion, but its operating expenses only increased by $479 million, so nearly all of that revenue gain translated to operating income growth. However, without the contribution from AWS, Amazon simply isn't growing very quickly.\n\nAWS has expanded Amazon far beyond e-commerce and made it a better business, but not in the same way that chips for data centers have been a game changer for Nvidia.\n\nIn Nvidia's recent quarter, which was third-quarter fiscal 2025 (ended Oct. 27), Nvidia reported $30.77 billion in revenue consisting of $27.64 billion from compute and $3.13 billion from networking. Operating income from the compute and networking segment came in at $22.081 billion -- giving the segment a ridiculously high operating margin of 71.8%. For context, Amazon -- as a whole -- booked $17.41 billion in operating income in its recent quarter. And AWS' margins aren't nearly as high as Nvidia's.\n\nNvidia's gaming and AI PC, professional visualization, and automotive and robotics segments combined for $4.22 billion in revenue. The graphics segment earned just $1.502 billion in operating income.\n\nIt's hard to believe, but five years ago, Nvidia's data center business was smaller than its graphics segment. Whereas today, data center makes up over 85% of Nvidia's revenue and over 90% of its operating income. In the quarter, Nvidia said that cloud service providers made up around 50% of its data center revenue, while the remainder consisted of consumer internet and enterprise companies. These customers (like AWS) are some of the highest-quality customers in the world. They are the exact kind of customers Nvidia wants because they have the financial means to invest through market cycles.\n\nNvidia went from a chip company for graphics to a chip company for data centers. In contrast, Amazon still does many different things, but the best part of its business is AWS. Nvidia has better margins and more growth potential. It has a more commanding market share. And it is a more pure-play investment thesis on data center growth, whereas Amazon's investment thesis crosses more industries and is more complex.\n\nNvidia has a fair valuation\n\nNvidia's biggest risks are a slowdown in AI capital spending or competition coming along and eroding margins. But so far, that hasn't happened. Nvidia has so far been an earnings-driven story. In fact, earnings growth has outpaced the growth in the stock price.\n\nEventually, Nvidia's growth will probably slow down. But until that happens, it's hard to call Nvidia a bubble because the business is delivering real, bottom-line results. This isn't a company that has the potential to do amazing things in the future; rather, it is delivering unbelievable results right now.\n\nBecause Nvidia has been an earnings-driven story, its valuation remains reasonable. Nvidia has a higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and forward P/E ratio than Amazon. But as you can see in the chart, the gap between the valuations of both companies could narrow if Nvidia continues to grow its earnings at a faster pace.\n\nOnly buy Nvidia if you have a long-term mindset\n\nNvidia and Amazon are excellent companies that stand to benefit from higher AI spending. However, competition or a cyclical slowdown could quickly make both companies look more expensive, leading to a steep sell-off.\n\nWhen buying industry-leading growth stocks at all-time highs, it's important to understand that the factors contributing to the record highs could be the same ones leading to a sell-off. Wall Street will waste no time downgrading a stock based solely on its near-term growth prospects. However, the good news is that individual investors don't have to get caught up in the noise and, instead, can focus on the long-term investment thesis.\n\nInvestors interested in Nvidia should continue to monitor its pace of technological advancements and ability to monetize those improvements. Currently, Nvidia is out-innovating its competition, so it can still charge top dollar for its products. Furthermore, its customers are doing so well that they can afford to pay pretty much whatever Nvidia is charging.\n\nNvidia is at the top of its game, and there has yet to be any concrete reason to believe it will change. But if the cycle does turn, there will be signs from Nvidia's top customers like AWS and Meta Platforms. The stock price continues to be driven by earnings growth, which should continue next year.\n\nIn sum, Nvidia has a simpler and more effective business model than Amazon and much better growth, making it the better buy now."

Arlington police say they are investigating.\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nExample video title will go here for this video\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas \u2014 Diana Aycox grew up on Maryannes Meadow Drive in Fort Worth and inherited the tidy brick home from her parents.\n\nShe spent her life taking care of other people\u2019s children. When dementia took hold in 2021, a doctor concluded she was mentally incapacitated and unable to care for herself. As a result, she needed to be taken care of by others.\n\n\u201cShe was just really sweet and confused,\u201d her neighbor, Deanna Torres said.\n\nThat\u2019s how Aycox came to live in an Arlington boarding home run by Ireka Hamilton.\n\nHamilton\u2019s name is well known to state regulators. Records show the state sued her after regulators repeatedly found her caring for clients in homes that should have been licensed as assisted living facilities. Two families filed lawsuits \u2013 which were recently settled \u2013 alleging she neglected their loved ones.\n\nNow there are questions \u2013 and a probate court battle \u2013 over how Hamilton came to own Aycox\u2019s home. Advocates say the allegations point to the larger problem of the state failing to adequately protect vulnerable people from financial exploitation.\n\n\u201cYou have unscrupulous actors who realize and capitalize on the fact that people who live in board and care homes are vulnerable to exploitation,\u201d said DJ Maughan, a public health expert and professor at Oklahoma State University.\n\nFor decades, Aycox was a fixture in this neighborhood of small brick homes. She was active in her church\u2019s choir and Bible study group.\n\nIn September 2021, not long after she ended up in the hospital and diagnosed with dementia, she signed a document giving her church pastor the power to make medical decisions.\n\nCourt records show he found the home operated by Hamilton and placed her there. Soon after, he resigned as power of attorney.\n\n\u201cHer church friends were initially of the understanding that she was getting good care and Ireka was helping her,\u201d Andrea Casanova, who later became Aycox\u2019s court-appointed guardian, told WFAA.\n\nIn February 2022, Hamilton filed what\u2019s known as a \u201csuggestion of need\u201d in Tarrant County probate court.\n\n\u201cShe has been deemed mentally incapacitated and cannot take care of herself,\u201d Hamilton wrote.\n\nHamilton also noted that Aycox owned a house, and she was \u201cunable to pay for both her care and her mortgage.\u201d She checked a box stating that she was Aycox\u2019s \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\nCasanova told WFAA that those court records showed that Hamilton knew that Aycox lacked the mental competence to make financial decisions such as selling her house.\n\nIn filing a suggestion of need, Hamilton triggered the court\u2019s oversight, which would later lead to the discovery that she had come to own Aycox\u2019s home.\n\nThe court appointed an investigator to investigate Aycox\u2019s situation. In August 2022, the court appointed attorney Bob Leonard to be Aycox's guardian ad litem. He met with Aycox and began to negotiate with her lender and discussed selling the property, according to court records.\n\nOn Aug. 30, 2022, he got word that the house had been sold for $120,000. He\u2019d soon learn Hamilton bought it.\n\nAccording to the seller\u2019s closing statement, about $76,300 went to pay off the existing loan on the property. Aycox was to receive about $42,000.\n\nLeonard quickly filed paperwork with the county to prevent Hamilton from selling the house.\n\n\u201cDiana did not know what she was signing,\u201d Casanova said. \u201cI do not even know if she knew to read the contract.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 12, 2022 -- 13 days after buying the house -- Hamilton put the home up for sale for $225,000, records show.\n\nRecords show Leonard told the court he researched Hamilton\u2019s history. He found that she had multiple lawsuits, including suits for foreclosure where she had lived, one for breach of contract and two separate filings for bankruptcy.\n\nThat same month, Leonard filed paperwork asking that a guardian be appointed. He suggested that Casanova be selected as that guardian.\n\nIn carrying out her duties, Casanova told WFAA that she went to see Aycox at the boarding home.\n\n\u201cThe staff originally did not want to let us enter the home even though we had a court order,\u201d Casanova said. \u201cI was able to visit with Diana for about maybe 10 minutes at the most until they came back in, and they wouldn't let me speak with her privately.\u201d\n\nThe court also appointed an attorney to represent Aycox. That attorney told the court that Aycox had given power of attorney to Hamilton so that she could \u201ctake care\u201d of her property and finances. He told the court that she \u201cfeels she is being taken care of and has people like Ms. Hamilton to help her.\u201d\n\nIn October 2023, the probate judge appointed Casanova as Diana\u2019s temporary guardian. Casanova said Aycox was there during the hearing.\n\n\u201cYou could see, she didn't even understand that she was being taken advantage of, that every piece of personal and sentimental property she owned was gone, and that her only asset that could actually pay for her care was taken away from her by a predator,\u201d Casanova said.\n\nCasanova said she got an emergency order removing Aycox from Hamilton\u2019s care.\n\nThe attorney then asked Hamilton for an accounting of Aycox\u2019s finances and requested that she turn over Aycox\u2019s property.\n\nHamilton sent a cashier\u2019s check in the amount of $42,000, which records show was the amount Aycox was to have been paid on the house.\n\nCasanova said when she tried to cash it, she found the cashier\u2019s check had been canceled.\n\nIn February, Casanova sued Hamilton on behalf of Aycox, alleging fraud. Court records show that constables have not been able to locate Hamilton to serve the lawsuit. In one case, she told a deputy constable over the phone that she did not want to \u201creceive the papers without her attorney\u2019s approval.\u201d However, she would not provide the attorney\u2019s information, the deputy constable wrote.\n\nAround the same time that Casanova filed the lawsuit, neighbors saw activity at the home. People were moving in.\n\n\u201cI noticed there were a lot of medical vans, elderly people being pushed in wheelchairs,\u201d said neighbor Derrick Moon.\n\nAnother neighbor said she was told by the people moving in that the \u201cproperty is now a group home.\u201d\n\nCasanova got a restraining order, and Hamilton agreed to move the tenants out.\n\nCasanova told WFAA that Hamilton denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cShe denies that this was financial exploitation of an elderly person and (said) that Diana did it of her own free will,\u201d Casanova said, referring to the sale of the house.\n\nWFAA reached Hamilton by phone. She declined to answer our questions.\n\nThere are similar questions about another boarding home operator named Regla Becquer.\n\nShe\u2019s under criminal indictment on a murder charge in the overdose death of a client. She\u2019s also charged with endangerment over allegations that she neglected another client. Her bail has been set at $1.5 million.\n\nRecords show she and her family gained control of the homes, cars and accounts of several clients.\n\nIn one case, Karen Walker signed over her \u201centire estate\u201d to Becquer. That\u2019s according to a one-paragraph will dated only 19 days before Walker died of heart disease.\n\nBecquer inherited an estate worth $331,00 that included Walker\u2019s Arlington home, money and car, court records show.\n\n\u201cThese predators see the vulnerable population as an easy target and they really are a perfect victim,\u201d Casanova said. \u201cThey can't remember what they said, what they did. They're completely reliant on these people to provide them safe shelter, food.\u201d\n\nCasanova reported the fraud allegation to the Arlington Police Department.\n\nPolice told WFAA the case remains open and they\u2019re investigating.\n\n\u201cThis is a community issue,\u201d Casanova said. \u201cIt can happen to any one of us any one of our families, any one of our grandparents, and it's a prevailing issue, and it shouldn't have to happen.\u201d\n\nThis past October marked three years since Aycox lived in the home on Maryannes Meadow.\n\nHamilton still legally owns the home, Tarrant County records show.\n\nAycox, now 76, lives in a memory care unit in Tarrant County. Her care is being paid for by Medicaid.\n\nThe house sits empty while the legal battle over the house continues."

In theory, they mark our journeys, reflecting who we are, what we value, and our lives at a given moment. But all too often, as Diane Morgan wrote in this newspaper this past weekend, they are actually hugely disappointing; a waste of money, or a cause of disquiet. Do they really know me?\n\nAs we obsess this week about Christmas gifts, it got me thinking about how the presents we wish for, or treasure, change dramatically as years pass. What\u2019s perfect at one age can feel alien at another. It\u2019s not the item itself, but what it represents: love, thoughtfulness, understanding. And, yes, I do recognise this is a first-world debate.\n\nIn childhood, gifts are about wonder; dreams made real. A new bike, a doll\u2019s house or the latest video game spark imagination and adventure. We don\u2019t see the price tag or the effort to acquire them (buying that last Nintendo Wii on Christmas Eve \u2013 oof). What matters is the joy they inspire. For children, a gift symbolises possibility, tangible proof that magic exists. I still remember the unmatched thrill of receiving a Striker football game, aged 10.\n\nIn our twenties, our wishes change. Learning to stand on our own two feet at university, in first jobs and moving out, gifts that resonate now are those that fuel freedom or ambition: a backpack for travels, gadgets to enable our lives, or \u2013 let\u2019s be honest \u2013 hard cash (received as enthusiastically as toys once were). The best presents are practical yet personal, an acknowledgment of burgeoning adulthood.\n\nBut, by our thirties, many of us are building careers, homes and families. We become the curators of our lives. Gift preferences reflect that: a quality kitchen gadget for shared dinners, or a luxury we wouldn\u2019t splurge on ourselves. We also begin to appreciate gifts that are investments \u2013 perhaps art or photography.\n\nOur forties are often a balancing act between roles as parents, professionals, and partners. By now, we \u2013 hopefully \u2013 know who we are. Gifts that celebrate individuality feel more profound: a favourite author\u2019s new novel, gig tickets for a band we loved as teenagers, a voucher for a retreat or event. The right gift acknowledges newly complex lives.\n\nThen, in our fifties, we begin to crave the indulgences we never thought to ask for or allowed ourselves. Luxurious furnishings or clothes, fine wines, or an extraordinary dinner become treasures, not for material worth but for the memories they promise. Legacy gifts, like a custom photo album, become increasingly poignant, symbols of nurtured connections.\n\nSo, to the sixties, where I somehow find myself. By now, we know that the greatest gift isn\u2019t something you can wrap. It\u2019s unquestionably time spent with loved ones. A future weekend with family, a long lunch with old friends; any shared experience that says: \u201cI\u2019ve really thought about you.\u201d\n\nThese don\u2019t come with receipts or return policies, but, as Mastercard would say, they\u2019re priceless. The most meaningful presents of all are the presence of those we love.\n\nGifts \u2013 like that Striker set, my ticket to see Queen, aged 15, or La Boh\u00e8me at 60 \u2013 are rarely about the thing itself. They\u2019re about connection, consideration and love. It\u2019s so worth putting in that little bit of effort this week to show you actually care."

            "article_content": "Dec. 7\u2014The arcane red light reportedly throbbed in the sky above Albuquerque's South Valley for about an hour in October 2023, caught on camera by a bewildered man who says, \"I've never seen a light that bright.\"\n\nA solid, bright orb drifted with angular elegance in February over Jal, near the state's southern border, startling an observer. As the nighttime scene unfolded near a Lea County oilfield, the observer reported feeling like the air was astir with a leaden static.\n\nVideos of these episodes of stargazing turning bizarre in a state known for enigmatic nighttime occurrences are among those catalogued by a popular UFO reporting platform and cellphone app operated by Enigma Labs. The company, founded in 2020, has issued a new report naming New Mexico its top state for sightings per capita, with several strange videos submitted this year showing lights over Albuquerque.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"New Mexico is a focal point for UFOs,\" said Alejandro Rojas, a consultant for Enigma Labs. \"But it's really interesting that New Mexico has really popped up in our data lately as being heads above the leader when it comes to submissions per person.\"\n\nThe data set comes as an obsession with unidentified flying objects continues nationwide, even after a congressionally mandated Pentagon report released in February found no evidence the federal government was covering up knowledge of extraterrestrial technology and no evidence UFO sightings are signs of aliens visiting Earth.\n\nA Pentagon office, known as the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, was created in 2022 to track what the government calls UAPs \u2014 unidentified anomalous phenomena \u2014 with 757 reported to the office between May and June of this year, according to a November report.\n\nStill, people continue to see things.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the fast-paced digital age, Enigma Labs provides an online trove of oddities \u2014 an endless proliferation of sights and sounds.\n\nThe private company offers a website and cellphone app allowing UFO enthusiasts \u2014 and regular people who believe they have encountered the anomalous \u2014 to upload videos and photos with descriptions, aggregating and crowdsourcing the data.\n\n\"Like millions of ants crawling around us,\" the individual who spotted something in Jal said in the Enigma post.\n\n\"I hate to say it. Those are ships!\" gushed a man who claimed he was witnessing alien plasma ships in Gallup near the Arizona border.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll told, the Land of Enchantment's rate of 12.2 Enigma entries per 100,000 people is far higher than the next closest states of Nevada and Arizona, which boast submission rates of around 9 per 100,000 residents, according to the company.\n\nUFO researchers have theories about the large volume of entries here, citing how alien mythology and lore have been woven into the state's cultural fabric for decades. According to the National UFO Reporting Center, 1,708 sightings have been reported in New Mexico, most of them since 2000.\n\n\"We have a relatively small population, but the one thing we do have, and I think this factors into your question, is a preponderance of military operations areas and scientific development areas \u2014 Los Alamos [National Laboratory], Sandia [National Laboratories] \u2014 a rich history of sightings,\" said David Marler, a longtime UFO researcher who lives in the Albuquerque area and serves as the executive director of a new UFO records center in Rio Rancho.\n\nWhile the Roswell incident has long been a dominant talker, Marler said there are many other intriguing reports of encounters over the last 75 years in New Mexico: April 1964, Socorro; April 1964, La Madera; March 1950, Farmington; November 1957, Kirtland Air Force Base.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA prevalent state for sightings\n\nEnigma Labs runs a New Mexico page that archives and cataloging sightings, rating and categorizing videos.\n\nAs of late November, the company had received 278 New Mexico sightings directly, according to an email from Rojas. Combined with publicly available sources, it has 3,531 total sightings in New Mexico archived.\n\n\"When you go back and look at early magazine reports and military reports going back to the 1950s, there were magazine articles showing maps where a lot of UFO sightings. One of the most prevalent states was New Mexico,\" Marler said.\n\nA fascination with the unknown has long gripped New Mexico. It's a state renowned \u2014 thanks to its dry climate, low population density and sprawling deserts \u2014 for its night sky viewing.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"One of the most spectacular reports is from last August. A witness said they were watching TV when they caught this weird object out of the corner of their eye. They were able to get a few seconds of video before it disappeared behind nearby trees,\" Rojas said of video footage taken in Chaparral, a Southern New Mexico community near El Paso.\n\nThe video shows a floating gray object with a television heard in the background.\n\nNew Mexico sightings logged into the Enigma Labs database break down like this: Albuquerque, 754; Las Cruces, 159; Roswell, 143; Alamogordo, 107; and Deming, 95. Rojas said eight sightings have been reported to Enigma from Santa Fe and one in Los Alamos.\n\nTwo friends were driving along San Mateo Boulevard in Albuquerque late one night in February when a moving craft in the sky lit up with lights flashing in a diagonal pattern.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn an episode that lasted about a minute, \"it went from a long craft to a triangle shaped craft with only 3 lights, and then to something that resembled a helicopter with one light, and quickly disappeared,\" states the caption on the for the video posted to Enigma Lab's site.\n\nNew records center in Rio Rancho\n\nTens of thousands of case files, among the earliest dated in 1947, are housed in Rio Rancho. They relay the stories of witnesses, couched in the diction of reports written by law enforcement officers or members of the military as far back as 70 years ago.\n\nThe files can be pored over at the new National UFO Historical Records Center, a facility that recently opened and can be visited by appointment.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"It's the largest historical archive ever assembled on the history of the subject in the history of the United States,\" said Marler, the director.\n\nThe volunteer-operated research center, at 1301 Nicklaus Drive SE, opened in October.\n\nIt holds rolls of decades-old microfilm, hundreds of thousands of audio recordings, an exhaustive library of foreign and domestic magazines, newsletters and periodicals \u2014 all dealing with reports of mysterious craft spotted from Earth. Some 2,000 books line the shelves, along with an interminable supply of UFO investigations and intrigue, with tales and testimony for those who believe.\n\n\"It's really set up for academics and for the general public who have a serious interest in the subject. It's not for the casual enthusiast per se,\" Marler said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe center has files from the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena, records kept by the largest citizen organization in the U.S. devoted to cataloguing UFO reports from 1956 until 1980, the year the group published its final newsletter. The center is currently digitizing the files for the first time ever.\n\nAlso in its possession are collections from the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization, once based in Alamogordo, with tens of thousands of case files \u2014 as well as collections from the UFO Research Committee of Akron, especially active in the 1950s in Ohio.\n\n\"We're literally getting these holdings in from all different points of the globe,\" Marler said.\n\nWell-documented cases beyond Roswell\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAcademics of unexplained phenomena have descended on the Land of Enchantment for a beloved UFO festival in Roswell. But the mythic narratives don't go dry there.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Roswell, Roswell, Roswell. That always dominates the conversation and there are better, more well-documented cases on file,\" Marler said, referring to the 1947 crash of a craft near the Southern New Mexico city. While many believe it was an extraterrestrial spacecraft, the federal government has said it was a secret military balloon aimed at detecting Soviet atomic bomb tests.\n\nMarler said many New Mexicans aren't aware of other cases within their own state.\n\nIn November of 1957, a UFO was tracked on radar and \"violated\" the perimeter of the Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, hovering around restricted sites, according to reports Marler has reviewed. He said the Rio Rancho records center has the original case file on it from \"Project Blue Book,\" the Air Force name for a project that investigated UFO reports between 1947 and 1969.\n\n\"Two Air Force personnel were observing it with binoculars at night. They described it as looking like a car standing vertically on end with a white light emanating out of the bottom. The object had the ability to hover, to rapidly accelerate, to move slowly,\" Marler said.\n\nThe Socorro incident in April 1964 \u2014 unresolved in the Air Force investigations that transpired at the time and widely reported by New Mexico news publications \u2014 was observed by local police Officer Lonnie Zamora, who claimed he witnessed two humanoids beside a shiny, egg-shaped object that later rose into the air from an arroyo as flames belched from the rising craft.\n\nMarler said he had believed the Socorro case was an isolated one. In the last year, however, he received the APRO files and came across an account published in the Santa Fe New Mexican of a similar report four days after the Socorro incident from La Madera, a remote community north of Ojo Caliente in Rio Arriba County.\n\n\"Eyewitness Recounts Passage of 'Thing' Burning in Sky,\" reads a headline in the April 28, 1964, edition of The New Mexican.\n\n\"It talks about Socorro, but it talks about a landing in La Madera ... and it described an egg-shaped object,\" Marler said. \"... New Mexico State Police [investigated and] drew a detailed diagram of the landing site and took pictures and colored photographs.\""

            "article_content": "Mysterious UFO drones have been spotted flying over New York City - after weeks of being photographed in New Jersey.\n\nStaten Island Borough President Vito Fossella confirmed that the peculiar objects had been seen flying above Howland Hook Marine Terminal and the West Shore on Staten Island earlier this week.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the FAA and FBI requesting an investigation, Fossella called the situation 'bizarre', according to PIX11.\n\n'It is odd and quite bizarre that nobody can figure out who is flying these drones, where they are coming from, and their purpose.\n\n'It is not just a bizarre situation, but also a concerning one, as it seems these drones can potentially become a danger to personal safety.'\n\nHe also stated that he was worried about the drones' ability to impede life-saving care in medical emergencies - especially over the two hospital systems on Staten Island.\n\n'It was recently reported that, during a medical emergency resulting from a crash in Branchburg, New Jersey, the presence of these drones prevented a medevac helicopter from being able to transport a seriously injured patient to the hospital.\n\n'We hope that such an investigation may shed light on what these drones are doing, where they are coming from and how to mitigate the risks they may pose on public safety.'\n\nMysterious UFO drones have been spotted flying over New York City - days after being photographed in New Jersey\n\nYesterday, new footage of at least five or possibly six of the unidentified drones was captured in a 50-second cell phone video in New Jersey, which one commenter declared was 'the clearest video yet.'\n\nOne drone, heard roaring in the skies as it moved through the darkness, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly and red lights blinking at the tips of its wings and tail.\n\nAnother drone came into frame that resembled a classic 'black triangle' UFO or the triangular TR-3B, which beamed bright white lights from its nose, wingtips and tail.\n\nSince mid-November, a wave of unexplained drone sightings above central Jersey has left both law enforcement and the general public watching the skies, hunting for clues on what these mysterious night flights might be.\n\nGovernor Phil Murphy has attempted to calm residents claiming these true UFOs pose 'no known threat to the public at this time,' but FBI and local police are actively investigating.\n\nConcerns have heightened over the proximity of these drone-like UFOs to President-elect Donald Trump's Bedminster golf course, US military research facility Picatinny Arsenal and critical local infrastructure.\n\n'Water reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, police departments, and military installations' have all had the UFOs roaming above them in recent weeks, according to the chief of police for the New Jersey borough of Florham Park.\n\n'Their presence appears nefarious in nature,' the police chief added.\n\nStaten Island Borough President Vito Fossella confirmed that the peculiar objects had been seen flying above Howland Hook Marine Terminal and the West Shore on Staten Island earlier this week\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' NJ native and TikTok creator @_bucky13 commented under his phone footage of the eerie drones (still image above), captioned 'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.' At least five drone-like UFOs are seen in his 50-second clip\n\nOne of the UFO drones, whose engines can be heard roaring from the ground, appeared to have a cluster of white lights on its underbelly with red lights blinking at its wingtips and tail (above)\n\nBut the New Jersian who posted the new footage of these drones online maintains the answer lies within America's own classified world of black budget projects.\n\n'Seems like they want them to be seen,' TikTok user @_bucky13 commented under his phone video of the eerie UFOs, captioned\n\n'Mysterious drones spotted all over New Jersey.'\n\n'I think they are trying to scare Russia by demonstrating some secret weapons,' he wrote.\n\nThe camera was pointed to the sky when the drones came into view.\n\n'There they are! There are more in New Jersey!,' he can be heard shouting in his handheld video \u2014 as an unsettled woman off-camera says, 'We shouldn't be outside.'\n\n'They look like an f***ing triangle! They look like a triangle,' he said in disbelief, as je spotted a triangular-shaped drone cruising into the night.\n\nA later UFO or drone seemed to hover stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect.\n\n'Are you freaking kidding me right now,' one woman can be heard saying of the craft.\n\nCommenters of UFO video joined him in his suspicion that the objects may ultimately prove to be top secret US military craft, even as the TikToker can be heard marveling in his video that 'an F-16 just flew over' in hot pursuit of the unidentified craft.\n\nAccording to one NJ local, this image depicts roughly nine of the unidentified drones flying in to the Garden State from the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday night, December 5\n\nA later UFO or drone in the new video looks like it might have hovered stationary beyond the tree line, lit up with multiple lights that pulsed bright enough to produce a lens flare effect\n\n'Looks like a military drone,' one Tik Tok user said, with another chiming in 'Definitely government made drones.'\n\nMany stated with confidence that the triangle craft was the legendary and still unconfirmed TR-3B 'Black Manta' anti-gravity spy plane, the alleged follow-up to the equally unconfirmed TR-3A, both claimed to have been made by defense contractor Northrop in the early 1990s.\n\n'Those are TR-3B government drones,' one poster said. 'Look them up, they're pretty cool.'\n\nA December 1991 cover story in Popular Mechanics was one of the first mainstream media reports to allege that the TR-3A existed as a highly advanced 'tactical reconnaissance vehicle' eyewitnesses said was 42-feet long with a 60-foot wingspan.\n\nOthers have speculated that the UFOs above New Jersey might be an update to US defense contractor Lockheed Martin\u2019s original 'Darkstar' that flew in 1996."

            "article_content": "At the heart of this cosmic mystery lies the Higgs field, a fundamental component of our universe that gives particles their mass. However, this field isn\u2019t as stable as we once thought. Scientists have discovered that the Higgs field could potentially \u201cbubble,\u201d creating pockets of altered reality where nothing could exist.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher, Lucien Heurtier, explains : \u201cThe Higgs field isn\u2019t likely to be in the lowest possible energy state it could be in. That means it could theoretically change its state, dropping to a lower energy state in a certain location.\u201d\n\nThis revelation has profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos. If the Higgs field were to shift to a lower energy state, it would dramatically alter the laws of physics within these \u201cbubbles.\u201d In such an environment :\n\nElectron masses would suddenly change\n\nParticle interactions would be altered\n\nProtons and neutrons would disintegrate\n\nLife as we know it would cease to exist\n\nThe paradox deepens when we consider the early universe and the hypothetical existence of primordial black holes. These minuscule black holes, potentially as small as a gram, are believed to have formed during the universe\u2019s inflationary period, mere moments after the Big Bang.\n\nPrimordial black holes : the universe\u2019s self-destruct button ?\n\nThe research team argues that if primordial black holes existed as current models suggest, they should have triggered widespread \u201cbubbling\u201d of the Higgs field. This cosmic chain reaction would have prevented the formation of any stable matter in the universe. Yet, here we are, contemplating our own existence.\n\nThis paradox presents scientists with two possible explanations :\n\nOur current models of primordial black holes are incorrect and need to be discarded There are fundamental aspects of the Higgs field\u2019s behavior that we don\u2019t yet understand\n\nThe implications of this study extend far beyond theoretical physics. It challenges our understanding of the universe\u2019s origins and stability, forcing us to reconsider established theories. This paradox is reminiscent of other unexpected discoveries that have baffled astronomers, pushing the boundaries of our cosmic knowledge.\n\nUnraveling the cosmic tapestry : new frontiers in physics\n\nAs scientists grapple with this existential paradox, new avenues of research are emerging. The quest to understand the universe\u2019s existence has led to innovative experiments and theoretical frameworks. One such breakthrough is the quantum cat experiment that set a record by surviving 1,400 seconds, pushing the boundaries of quantum superposition.\n\nThese advancements in quantum physics may hold the key to unraveling the Higgs field mystery. By exploring the behavior of particles at the quantum level, scientists hope to gain insights into the stability of the Higgs field and its interactions with other cosmic phenomena.\n\nThe study of cosmic paradoxes extends beyond the realm of physics. Recent research has even challenged our understanding of what happens in the brain after death, defying all logic. These discoveries highlight the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines and the need for a holistic approach to understanding our universe.\n\nRedefining reality : the impact on scientific thought\n\nThe revelation that the universe shouldn\u2019t exist according to current models has profound implications for scientific thought. It challenges researchers to question established theories and explore new paradigms. This shift in thinking could lead to revolutionary discoveries across various fields, from astrophysics to quantum mechanics.\n\nTo illustrate the potential impact of this paradigm shift, consider the following table :\n\nScientific Field Current Understanding Potential Paradigm Shift Cosmology Big Bang Theory Multi-dimensional universe models Particle Physics Standard Model Unified field theories Quantum Mechanics Copenhagen Interpretation Many-worlds interpretation Astrophysics Dark Matter/Energy Modified gravity theories\n\nAs scientists continue to probe the mysteries of the universe, unexpected discoveries are reshaping our understanding of reality. From new types of materials that could change our lives to fundamental questions about existence itself, the frontiers of science are expanding rapidly.\n\nThe paradox of the universe\u2019s existence serves as a humbling reminder of how much we have yet to learn. It invites us to embrace uncertainty, question our assumptions, and continue exploring the cosmic tapestry that surrounds us. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the Higgs field and primordial black holes, we may uncover truths that reshape our understanding of reality itself."

ToW, which is a part of the foundation set up by Anil Pradhan, a civil engineer, currently operates in Odisha and Telangana.\"Once children are exposed to advanced topics, only then will they be able to think big,\" feels Nihar, who said there were no such facilities in his childhood.Among the practical projects exposing rural children to science are satellite launch, 3D printing and town planning, among others. At least 1,200 students from Satyananda High School, Radhanath Bidyapith, Radhanath ME School, all in Soro, Maudamani High School and Banka Bihari Nodal ME School in Barahapur, and Gopinath High School, Kudei. \"The project was easy to implement as we got a cluster of schools within a 5-km radius,\" said Nihar.For the children, the vehicles are a big attraction as they are being taught in stages. \"First, we had an introductory class and teachers in the vehicle explained about electricity and cleared our doubts,\" said Archana Jena, a Class IX student of Gopinath Govt High School.In-charge headmistress, Laxmi Kumari Agarwal, said children don't have to memorise science concepts as the teachers on the vehicles are explaining it to them. \"Also, the school does not have to spend on such infrastructure. Children are happy that they are getting practical knowledge, and many want to participate,\" said Agarwal.A finale will be held later this month in which children will demonstrate a science project made by them. \"After coming to know about the tinker vehicles, more schools in the locality want to participate. I am planning to expand the initiative before the finale,\" said Nihar."
