        "article_content": "Sean M. Kirkpatrick testifies last year before a Senate subcommittee about his findings as head of the Pentagon\u2019s UFO-hunting agency.\n\nTrained as a physicist, Sean M. Kirkpatrick has spent most of his career in government, much of it as an intelligence and technology expert for various Pentagon agencies, culminating in an 18-month stint as the government\u2019s lead investigator of UFOs.\n\nIt was in that latter position \u2014 as the first director of the Pentagon\u2019s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, that Kirkpatrick came face to face with the tide of misinformation and disinformation infecting America\u2019s public discourse on scientific matters.\n\n\u201cAfter painstakingly assembling a team of highly talented and motivated personnel to develop a rational, systematic and science-based strategy to investigate these phenomena,\u201d Kirkpatrick wrote in a Scientific American op-ed in January, shortly after his December retirement from AARO, he and his team were overwhelmed by a \u201cwhirlwind of tall tales, fabrication and secondhand or thirdhand retellings of the same,\u201d producing \u201ca social media frenzy and a significant amount of congressional and executive time and energy spent on investigating these so-called claims.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019re seeing the degradation of critical thinking skills and rational thought when it comes to analyzing what\u2019s out in the world. \u2014 Sean M. Kirkpatrick\n\nKirkpatrick\u2019s observations would be familiar to scientists examining the origins of COVID, a field in which the overwhelming weight of the evidence undermines a partisan theory positing a leak from a Chinese laboratory; or the rise in anti-vaccine claims; or even those examining the false assertion by the Trump/Vance campaign of Haitian immigrants stealing and eating household pets.\n\nAll the same elements are there: the whirlwind of fabrications, the social media frenzies, the distracting effects on Congress and the White House \u2014 not to mention the complicity of the news media. \u201cThe modern media cycle drives stories faster than sound research, science and peer review time lines can validate them,\u201d Kirkpatrick wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewsletter Get the latest from Michael Hiltzik Commentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner. Enter email address Sign Me Up You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u201cIn my case,\u201d Kirkpatrick told me a few days ago, \u201cI\u2019ve been accused of lying to the American people.\u201d\n\nHe further revealed to the Guardian that he had experienced UFO true believers \u201cthreaten my wife and daughter, and try to break into our online accounts \u2014 far more than I ever had as the deputy director of intelligence [of U.S. Strategic Command]. I didn\u2019t have China and Russia trying to get on me as much as these people are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat would also be familiar to other scientists on the front lines of such inquiries. Scientists whose work has validated the theory that the virus causing COVID-19 reached humans via the wildlife trade in southeast Asia have been hauled before a House committee to be shrieked at by the likes of Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), and to be accused of taking bribes and, yes, lying to the public. Vaccine advocates have been physically confronted and even assaulted by anti-vaxxers.\n\nKirkpatrick hasn\u2019t participated in the debates over those issues, but he does see them as representative of the same type of doubt- and conspiracy-mongering he faced in his own territory. So let\u2019s first examine his experience as head of AARO.\n\nThe office was established in 2022 to investigate reports and earlier, of UFOs \u2014 or, to use the preferred official term, unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs.\n\nFrom the start, Kirkpatrick says, he was determined to conduct a rigorously empirical inquiry: \u201cWe were looking for any data to substantiate any claims that were being made to Congress or in the social media arena.\u201d\n\nThat applied not only to pilots\u2019 reports of objects that seemed to have displayed unusual aeronautical behavior, but a farrago of reports in the press, online, and among committed UFO believers about purportedly secret government programs to collect, examine and even attempt to reverse-engineer technology supposedly retrieved from crashed extraterrestrial UAPs.\n\nAARO turned up \u201cno evidence of anything extraterrestrial,\u201d Kirkpatrick says. Of reports that the office ruled to be unexplained, the reason \u201ccame down to not having enough data to even make an assessment.\u201d When AARO interviewed pilots, he says, \u201cnine times out of 10,\u201d data from their aircraft failed to substantiate their recollections that often resulted from optical illusions or common sensor anomalies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agency did find indications that some sightings were related not to ETs, but to foreign surveillance activities, including by China, which Kirkpatrick has said possesses technological capabilities that may match or even exceed those of the U.S. That\u2019s plainly a national security issue, as he testified to a Senate subcommittee in April 2023, but not an interstellar one.\n\nAs for secret government programs, according to an unclassified report AARO issued in March, the agency examined every claim in the press and social media \u2014 of CIA experiments, \u201cleaked\u201d government documents, technology tests purportedly witnessed by \u201caliens,\u201d physical examinations of extraterrestrial spacecraft, collections of extraterrestrial material in the possession of private companies, and so on.\n\nAARO found them all to be the product of mistaken overheard conversations, falsified documents, the misinterpretation of unexceptional terrestrially manufactured material as extraterrestrial artifacts. None of the people making these claims and interviewed by AARO turned out to have firsthand knowledge of these programs and incidents, but were mostly repeating what they had heard from others.\n\n\u201cThe aggregate findings of all [U.S. government] investigations to date,\u201d the report states, \u201chave not found even one case of UAP representing off-world technology.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, these claims have been a staple of news reporting for years, even by some of most august news organizations. They have been made by witnesses paraded before congressional committees \u2014 though as Kirkpatrick noted in Scientific American, \u201cnone of the conspiracy-minded \u2018whistleblowers\u2019 in the public eye had elected to come to AARO to provide their \u2018evidence\u2019 and statement for the record despite numerous invitations.\u201d\n\nThe source of the narrative is a small cadre of individuals associated with Las Vegas industrialist Robert Bigelow, who funded research into UAPs \u2014 as well as on paranormal phenomena \u2014 through a private organization he disbanded in 2004. Bigelow apparently persuaded the late Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to ask the Pentagon to establish a program to safeguard the alien material that the government was allegedly hiding. (The Defense Department refused.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBigelow continued to press his conviction that aliens have visited Earth from outer space after 2004, including during a 2017 interview on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d He didn\u2019t reply to my request for comment, relayed via his company Bigelow Aerospace.\n\nAs with UAPs, the same names keep cropping up in the COVID origins debate. The list of promoters has barely changed since the pandemic erupted in early 2020, many of them cited misleadingly as experts in news articles promoting the lab-leak theory, which are invariably (and embarrassingly) evidence-free.\n\nThere are some distinctions between how the UAP debate and those over COVID\u2019s origins and the safety and efficacy of vaccines have unfolded. Advocates of the lab-leak theory of COVID\u2019s origins don\u2019t appear to have well-heeled financial backers at their core, for example. But at the heart of that theory and the anti-vaccination movement are self-interested advocates who feed one another\u2019s convictions.\n\n\u201cSome of them are naive, some like to influence power and legislation, some are in it for money, some for fame, some may even be true believers,\u201d Kirkpatrick says. They almost never admit to error, because \u201cthey\u2019ve made this central to their life\u2019s purpose.\u201d They inject their convictions into politics and the legislative process \u201cthrough access to higher authorities,\u201d to drive the Defense Department and the intelligence community \u201cto do things and spend money.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with people asking the government to \u201cdefinitively investigate some of these things and put some evidence on the table and show what is true and what isn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere it becomes an issue is when it is a continuous hammering of this until they get an answer that they like, even though everything uncovered to date points to the contrary.\u201d\n\nThat points to \u201ca larger problem with public opinion about scientific inquiry \u2014 science by social media versus science by scientific method,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the degradation of critical thinking skills and rational thought when it comes to analyzing what\u2019s out in the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen scientific data confound received beliefs, he says, \u201cpeople cry \u2018conspiracy,\u2019 or \u2018the data is wrong,\u2019 or \u2018scientists are making it up.\u2019... Well, some of these scientists have been around for 30 or 40 years. If you don\u2019t believe they know what they\u2019re doing, then what are you going to base your decisions on in the future? Just pure belief and speculation?\u201d\n\nKirkpatrick is working on another article on the topic of misinformation. \u201cI see what I was doing on UAP and misinformation as a microcosm of many other issues that challenge the U.S. today. That is, the division across belief lines where evidence suggests a contrary opinion that conflicts with one\u2019s own belief system or political system.\u201d\n\nThose conflicts can be exploited by foreign adversaries or domestic actors seeking political gains or personal fortunes. \u201cIt\u2019s a common and increasing trend that\u2019s worrisome from a governance perspective,\u201d Kirkpatrick says with a passionate edge to his voice. \u201cHow do you govern when those gaps and seams are not only being exacerbated and exploited, but are amplified through social media and media with influence over political powers in the U.S.?\u201d\n\nHaving devoted his career to the national security, the trend leaves him concerned and appalled. \u201cThe public needs to understand how science works, and if it goes against their belief, it\u2019s not a conspiracy,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThey need to understand that their beliefs are being exploited, either by people in the U.S. or people in other countries for gain. If the American public understood fully that they\u2019re being taken advantage of, they address things differently. Because Americans don\u2019t like to be taken advantage of.\u201d"

I don't think I'll be able to ever stop playing it. In her review Kerry called it a \" superb retro-style smorgasbord \".\n\nIn addition to hosting 50 8-bit style console games belonging to a fictional 1980s studio, UFO 50 is really dedicated to the fiction of its games' provenance: each has a precise little history, and running through the whole collection are references to other games in the collection. It also has a terminal accessible in the main menu which allows players to enter eight figure codes.\n\n[Word of warning: If you'd prefer to discover all this yourself, be aware that potentially huge spoilers follow.]\n\nWell, players are discovering codes at a rapid rate, both on the Steam community forums and Reddit. Some are merely functional: the prefix EXEC- followed by the relevant four-figure game code will load that game. For example, EXEC-GOLF loads Golfaria. Similarly, the prefix HELP- will bring up a list of commands for the game. You can access GOLF's placement in the full list of games with the LIST-GOLF. If I enter LIST-GOLF, I see this:\n\nUFO 50\n\nNote that it only shows 17 entries at a time. If I enter the last game in that list with LIST-OVER, I see all the way up to 50. But what if I try to see beyond 50? Well, there's apparently a 51st game with the codename MIAS.\n\nUFO 50\n\nThis isn't the only way to discover the 51st game by the way. One Reddit user found the code in Barbuta, which is the first game in the UFO 50 menu and, if you don't mind me saying so, a huge glorious pain in my arse. There's also this Reddit thread with a bizarrely elaborate chain of events leading up to the discovery of EXEC-MIAS and beyond that I haven't followed myself, though suffice to say, there are other related codes that aren't just shortcuts.\n\nWhat is the 51st UFO 50 game? Well, it starts in a basement. The player character is a confused-looking humanoid frog, and after a bit of prodding around they discover they've been locked in the basement. It has a slightly eerie found footage vibe about it, despite sharing the same 8-bit pixel art as the rest of the games in the collection. After a few interactions you'll be able to access a computer in the basement which provides access to what seems to be a prototype version of Paint Chase.\n\nUFO 50\n\nIs EXEC-MIAS a \"game\" or a kind of meta-narrative about UFOsoft itself? How deep does it go, how many prototypes can I access, and what the heck else is UFO 50 hiding? Needless to say, I'm as obsessed as I was when Spelunky HD still had hidden secrets."

        "article_content": "Game Theory: UFO 50 is a massive trove of twists on old-school gaming genius Scroll until you find a title that sounds cool; you may hit something that'll be one of your favorite games of 2024.\n\nWhen approaching a video game project like Mossmouth\u2019s new release UFO 50\u2014an absolutely massive labor of love that is brilliant, frustrating, fun, mysterious, artistically ambitious, and sometimes just really fucking frustrating\u2014it helps to start from base principles. So: UFO 50, released on Steam this week, is a collection of 50 games of varying length and complexity, all purportedly from a fictional 1980s video game developer called UFOSoft. The games in the collection, which are presented in a fake chronological order built around the loosely sketched history of the company, largely draw their inspirations from the library of the Nintendo Entertainment System; amidst more esoteric or complicated pastiches, you can find games that serve as fairly straight homages to River City Rampage, Uninvited, Solar Jetman, Dragon Quest, and many more. There are meta elements operating to the side of the main draw\u2014notes on the games\u2019 fake development, a terminal that lets you go digging for secrets, markers that indicate when you\u2019ve completed individual titles\u2014but the focus has clearly been put on the games themselves, which were developed (in our world) by the Mossmouth team, including Spelunky creator Derek Yu.\n\nThe obvious comparison point for all this, at least for nerds of a certain vintage, will be clear: Cult Nintendo DS title Retro Game Challenge (and its sadly never-exported-from-Japan sequel), which pulled this same basic \u201cfake games from fake consoles from a fake past\u201d conceit back in 2007. Players who come to UFO 50 looking for a direct recreation of that experience might come away a little disappointed, though: Where that game prided itself on building up the fiction surrounding its faux games, complete with fake manuals and fake magazines for players to peruse in between playing its riffs on Mario or Galaga, UFO 50 is a bit more barebones in its presentation. (You get a few sentences of notes per game, and that\u2019s about it.) Given a choice between putting their emphasis on the games, or on the materials surrounding them, the small Mossmouth team understandably focused on function over form; we might wish for a more lush package, but it honestly feels churlish to complain, when the actual content of the collection is far more expansive than we\u2019ve had time to even come close to coming to terms with.\n\nAs to that content: We wish we could declare each of UFO 50\u2032s 50 games a retro-indie masterpiece, each one preserving what worked from classic game design while jettisoning the chaff, but, uh\u2026 No. Don\u2019t get us wrong: There are extremely good games in here, some more than worth the collection\u2019s $25 asking price all on their own. (We have lost too many hours this past week already to arena shooter Overbold, or mechanically gorgeous dungeon crawler Valbrace.) But many of the games in the collection feel torn between their desire to stay true to the clunky, frequently unfair controls of console ages past, and being genuinely fun games. Yes, it feels authentic that Barbuta, the very first game in the collection, happily wipes your progress every time you lose all your lives, erasing what could be 20 minutes of very fussy trap and dungeon navigation. Whether it\u2019s fun is a much thornier question.\n\nBut while we can\u2019t champion UFO 50 as 50 instant masterpieces, we also can\u2019t paint it with the broad brush of being uniformly old-school ornery for its old sake\u2014or a nostalgia exercise with no appeal for players who didn\u2019t grow up pulling battered NES carts off the rental wall of their local video store. The truth is that this really is 50 different games, each with their own control schemes and design hooks, and the quality is inevitably going to vary. Part of the fun of the package, in fact, is in that kind of discovery: For every game you play five minutes of before concluding \u201cEh, not for me,\u201d you\u2019re just as likely to run into something like the boldly strange Mooncat, or \u201cWhat if we\u2019d invented tower defense games on the NES\u201d hypothetical Rock On! Island. At the bare minimum, each title has something genuinely clever powering it, whether it\u2019s Mortol\u2018s attempt to build an action game out of Lemmings DNA, or Avianos\u2018 bird-based war gaming. Half the time, when we caught ourselves thinking \u201cOkay, we get it, let\u2019s move on\u201d after poking around at a game, we turned out to be basically right; the other half, though, we inevitably stumbled into some new secret or twist of play that deepened the experience of an individual title.\n\nUFO 50 is, in other words, a game that trusts you, the player, to find the fun\u2014with the promise that there is a lot of fun to be found in this odd, massive toy chest. We should note that the game does have a few curation tools\u2014if you scroll down to the bottom of the collection, you can filter games by whether they\u2019re meant to be more reflex based, or cerebral, for instance, or focus in on the title\u2019s large number of same-screen multiplayer games. (Breaking free of the chronology is a good idea in any case; although UFO 50 doesn\u2019t pay as much attention to the \u201ccomplexity increases as fictional time passes\u201d conceit that powered Retro Game Challenge, you\u2019ll still tend to find more robust experiences closer to the end of UFOSoft\u2019s fictional lifespan.) We\u2019re sure we\u2019ll soon see a cottage industry of guides and wider critiques pointing out hidden gems buried in its library. But honestly, we recommend just doing what the game itself advises: Scroll through until you find a title that sounds cool, blow off the fictional dust, and take a gamble on the chance you\u2019ll hit something that\u2019ll be one of your favorite games of 2024."

Provided by Suki.\n\nAMSTERDAM \u2014 When people think about artificial intelligence integrated into the medical field, they often think of Star Wars, Mike Maus, chief revenue officer for Suki Assistant, says. Suki is starting somewhere simpler.\n\nAs of March, St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Amsterdam is the first hospital in the Capital Region to integrate Suki, a digital assistant for physicians that is powered by artificial intelligence, into its facility. Suki is an application that can be utilized on a computer or phone. Once a patient gives consent, Suki listens to, records and takes notes of a conversation between a patient and doctor.\n\n\u201cIt really makes medicine more of a human-to human-interaction,\u201d Maus said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s what you want.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nWithin a minute of the conversation ending, the application consolidates the information into concise notes for the doctor who reviews it before filing it into a patient's electronic health record.\n\nAs a trained physician\u2019s assistant, Julie Demaree, executive director of clinical innovation and transformation at St. Mary's, saw the value Suki offered to alleviate the stress and administrative work of physicians.\n\n\u201cNobody goes into medicine to sit behind a computer or write notes,\u201d Demaree said. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary evil. We have to do it to get paid. We have to do it to communicate with other physicians.\u201d\n\nDemaree said the demands on physicians for medical documentation has grown exponentially in the past 25 years. After consistently feeling like doctors were being overloaded with work outside of caring for patients, she was excited that \u201cfinally we had something to offer that was going to take a burden away.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nThe goal of Suki, Maus said, is for it to be an invisible tool that reduces the \u201ccognitive burden\u201d experienced by those working in the medical field. Suki has been in development for six and a half years and in that time the company has doubled in size. As part of Suki's pilot program, the initial implementation fee at St. Mary\u2019s was waived.\n\nThe rollout of Suki started at St. Mary\u2019s in March, with four physicians using the software \u2014 by May, 12 were using it. Those doctors saw more than a 50% reduction in time spent on the computer updating notes in the months that followed, Demaree said. Rather than having to split attention between taking notes and listening to patients, or rush after a visit to write down notes before forgetting, physicians are able to be present and focused with patients, she said.\n\n\u201cWe can use AI to help people not make mistakes or miss things, help us do things faster or better, or in this case, help humans do what humans are good at, the feeling, the relationship, the listening, the caring that machines can\u2019t do; while taking away some of the administrative burden that we\u2019ve inflicted upon ourselves due to regulations and payments.\u201d\n\nDemaree said that AI within the medical field is on the rise and having an impact. AI is being used to read mammograms, for instance, as it is able to notice changes in breast architecture undetectable to the human eye. St. Mary\u2019s recently installed a new MRI machine that uses AI to utilize less slices and produce more accurate images that lessen the time patients have to sit in the MRI scanner.\n\nAdvertisement Article continues below this ad\n\nPhysicians at St. Mary\u2019s still have to manually copy and paste the notes into the electronic medical record, so the content generated by Suki is never unchecked or unedited. Suki also offers suggested diagnoses, which Demaree said is particularly useful for their physicians as there aren\u2019t many subspecialists in Amsterdam. Many primary care doctors, she said, are addressing issues of various specialties like cardiology, nephrology and endocrinology.\n\nDemaree has received positive feedback from physicians using Suki and hopes to onboard five new care providers with the application. While not all providers at St. Mary\u2019s use Suki, it is a tool available for all. Demaree believes that as more see the benefits of it, the number will increase."

Greg Yuelling was previously visiting the Civil War battle site in Pennsylvania, US, when he captured the eerie clip.\n\n\u201cWe were driving along one night and we started hearing noises, I heard things to the left and my uncle heard things to the right, and there was a fog, but the fog was weird, it was only in one patch not dispersed,\" he explained\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThen we saw these shapes moving in the darkness, they were the size of humans, one of them ran right through the cannon.\"\n\nThe bloke watched the videos back and ended up pretty \u2018freaked out\u2019. It made him \u2018believe everything\u2019 as he was sure he\u2019d captured ghosts of the soldiers.\n\nBut when LADbible presented this footage to Help! My House is Haunted presenters Barri Ghai and Jayne Harris, it seems Yuelling may not have captured the figures after all.\n\nAdvert\n\nInvestigator and technical expert Ghai says he watched the video \u2018several times\u2019 before coming up with a \u2018logical explanation\u2019.\n\n\u201cThese are not spirits,\u201d he begins. \u201cDespite Gettysburg being rife with history and loads of paranormal stories over the years. I think what I'm seeing there is moisture on the windscreen.\u201d\n\nHe reckons they were ghosts. (SWNS)\n\nYeah, pretty underwhelming. Ghai explains that the video seems to be from inside the car and it appears to be foggy.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThere's definitely moisture that seems to be running down the face of the windscreen,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I think it's a combination of the environmental factors and what he's actually seeing through the mist and the fog.\u201d\n\nAnd historian and psychologist Harris agrees that as amazing as the video seems in such a historical location, there\u2019s just \u2018too many environmental factors\u2019 involved.\n\n\u201cIt looks brilliant,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a good, impressive clip but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a ghost.\u201d But Harris does appreciate it\u2019s pretty disappointing for investigators to be sceptical about this type of stuff.\n\n\u201cWe see so many photographs and video clips, and especially, obviously now with mobile phones and these, you know, people are recording their own things all the time,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvert\n\nGhai and Harris know what they're on about. (discovery+)\n\nWell, there you have it, those \u2018ghosts\u2019 at Gettysburg aren\u2019t really ghosts \u2013 at least not in that video anyway.\n\nIf you do want to see Ghai and Harris in action with what they believe to actually be ghosts and spirits, a new season of Help!

These peculiar noises, known as \"biotwang,\" resemble sci-fi starship sounds and are thought to be vocalizations used by the whales to communicate and locate one another in the vast ocean. The biotwang serves a function similar to a game of Marco Polo, where the whales call out to establish their positions.This discovery sheds light on the complexities of marine communication and the fascinating behaviors of deep-sea creatures , emphasizing the importance of understanding how these animals interact in their underwater environment.The unusual sounds were first detected in 2014 during an acoustic survey of the Mariana Trench, which stretches over 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometres) south of Japan and reaches depths of 35,876 feet (10,935 metres). The biotwang consists of two distinct components: a deep, grumbling reverberation and a high-pitched, metallic ringing that has drawn comparisons to spaceship sounds in popular sci-fi franchises like Star Trek and Star Wars.Initially, the origin of these sounds puzzled scientists. By 2016, researchers speculated that the biotwang might be produced by large baleen whales, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) or humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), but none of the calls matched known whale sounds.As per the recent study, researchers have definitively linked the biotwang to Bryde's whales, aided by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools that analysed over 200,000 hours of audio data from various ocean recordings. The breakthrough came when the team observed a group of Bryde's whales swimming near the Mariana Islands and recorded nine of them producing the distinctive noise. Lead author Ann Allen, an oceanographer at NOAA's Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, noted, \"Once, it's a coincidence. Twice is happenstance. Nine times, it's definitely a Bryde's whale.\"To conclusively establish that Bryde's whales were the source of the biotwang, researchers correlated the timing of the calls with the whales' migration patterns, analysing years of audio captured by monitoring stations in the Mariana Archipelago and surrounding areas. They utilised AI to convert the biotwang into visual representations called spectrograms, which allowed a machine learning algorithm to differentiate these sounds from others.The findings indicated that biotwang was predominantly detected in the northwest Pacific, suggesting that a specific population of Bryde's whales is responsible for the calls, even though the species inhabits a much broader range. Interestingly, the data revealed an increase in biotwang sounds during 2016, coinciding with an El Ni\u00f1o event that raised ocean temperatures and attracted more Bryde's whales to the region.While the exact reason for the bizarre nature of these calls remains unclear, researchers hypothesise that the biotwang functions as a contact call, helping whales locate each other in the vast ocean. Allen stated, \"It's possible that they use the biotwang as a contact call, a sort of 'Marco Polo' of the ocean,\" emphasising the need for further research to confirm this theory."

        "article_content": "Astronomers have uncovered a surprising group of frozen bodies orbiting the Sun, far beyond the known Kuiper Belt, Space.com has reported. These objects were identified using the Subaru Telescope in collaboration with NASA\u2019s New Horizons mission.\u201cIf this is confirmed, it would be a major discovery,\u201d Fumi Yoshida, from the University of Occupational and Environmental Health Sciences and the Planetary Exploration Research Center, Chiba Institute of Technology, said in a statement.Located atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii, the Subaru Telescope has been working with New Horizons since its 2006 launch toward Pluto, which the spacecraft flew by in 2015. Since then, New Horizons has continued to explore the Kuiper Belt. According to NASA, the Kuiper Belt is a doughnut-shaped region of icy bodies extending far beyond the orbit of Neptune and home to Pluto and Arrokoth.Subaru initially faced a problem when it began searching for Kuiper Belt objects in 2004 as possible targets for New Horizons to either visit up close or observe with its cameras from a distance after encountering Pluto. It was difficult to pick out Kuiper Belt objects from all the background stars at the time because Pluto and the area of the outer solar system that New Horizons was travelling through were located in the Sagittarius constellation, which has the dense Milky Way as a backdrop.Subaru was only able to identify 24 Kuiper Belt objects at the time, all of which were too far away for New Horizons to reach or view with its cameras after it left Pluto. However, Pluto and that part of the solar system have moved away into a sparser region of the night sky that allowed Subaru\u2019s Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) to discover 239 objects since 2020.Yoshida noted that understanding these distant objects could provide insights into the solar system\u2019s formation and its comparison with other planetary systems. The discovery may challenge previous assumptions about the size of the Kuiper Belt and the solar nebula that formed our planetary system.\"The most exciting part of the HSC was the discovery of 11 objects at distances beyond the known Kuiper Belt,\" said Yoshida.\"I think the discovery of distant objects and the determination of their orbital distribution are important as a stepping stone to understanding the formation history of the solar system, comparing it with exoplanetary systems, and understanding universal planet formation,\" Yoshida added.The discovery of these distant bodies is not entirely out of the blue. The continued presence of dust suggests that it is being produced by a population of bodies farther out. Additionally, New Horizons has witnessed unexplained stellar occultations. Furthermore, observations from other star systems also indicate that similar extended belts might exist elsewhere.Wes Fraser of the National Research Council of Canada, who led the new findings, said, \"Our solar system's Kuiper Belt long appeared to be very small in comparison with many other planetary systems, but our results suggest that idea might just have arisen due to an observational bias.\"\"So maybe, if this result is confirmed, our Kuiper Belt isn't all that small and unusual after all compared to those around other stars,\u201d Wes Fraser added.\"This is a groundbreaking discovery revealing something unexpected, new and exciting in the distant reaches of the solar system. This discovery probably would not have been possible without the world-class capabilities of the Subaru Observatory,\" said Alan Stern, the principal investigator for New Horizons.The findings are set to be published in the Planetary Science Journal. The discovery of these distant objects is further evidence that there is still much to be discovered in the extreme depths of the outer solar system, possibly including dwarf planets and the elusive Planet Nine."

Its massive stone statues (the moai) and the islanders\u2019 intriguing culture have inspired countless theories about the island\u2019s mysterious past. But the big statues aren\u2019t even the most interesting thing on the island.\n\nHistorians and archaeologists are more interested in two long-standing debates: whether the island\u2019s inhabitants experienced an ecological collapse before European contact, and if Polynesians made trans-Pacific voyages to the Americas before the arrival of Europeans.\n\nA groundbreaking genetic study now sheds new light on both topics. Using genetic data from ancient Rapa Nui individuals, the research finds that the Rapanui people were far more resilient than previously thought \u2014 and likely also had contact with Native Americans.\n\nThe \u201cEcocide\u201d hypothesis: A collapse that never was?\n\nThe island Rapa Nui was home to one of the most isolated populations in history. The island\u2019s inhabitants endured famines, epidemics, environmental collapse, and slave raids, and saw their population crash on more than one occasion.\n\nEuropeans didn\u2019t come to the island until 1722. They found a society of around 3,000 people and were stunned to see an entirely unique culture. However, the islanders\u2019 culture was essentially destroyed in the 1800s when Peruvian slavers came, looking for captives to sell. Then further change was enforced when religious colonists came in and converted the island to Christianity.\n\nEaster Island map also showing its position relative to South America. Image via Wiki Commons.\n\nResearchers studying Rapa Nui found evidence suggesting that even before the Europeans arrived, the population was in a downward spiral. This \u201cecocide\u201d theory posits that the Rapanui, in their pursuit of constructing the moai and expanding their population, overexploited the island\u2019s natural resources. Deforestation, depletion of food sources, and subsequent internal strife supposedly led to a catastrophic population collapse in the 1600s, sending the Rapanui people down a dark road of warfare, famine, and cannibalism.\n\nHowever, the new genomic research tells a different story. The study analyzed the genomes of 15 ancient Rapanui individuals, whose remains dated to between 1670 and 1950 CE. The findings revealed that the Rapanui did not experience a severe population bottleneck during the 1600s, as the ecocide theory suggests. Instead, the data show a steady population increase after the island was first settled around 1250 CE.\n\nThis genetic evidence suggests that, while the people did experience severe environmental challenges (such as deforestation), this did not lead to a population collapse. Instead, the Rapanui demonstrated remarkable resilience.\n\nWhat makes this finding so significant is that it confirms what some archaeologists and anthropologists have suspected for years. The Polynesians, legendary seafarers known for their navigational skills, likely made the voyage to South America long before European ships ventured into the Pacific.\n\nThere\u2019s substantial evidence that Polynesian people discovered South America way before Columbus. After all, 10% of Easter Island was used for growing sweet potatoes, a species that originated in the Americas.\n\nPolynesian navigators traversed the vast Pacific Ocean, relying on their deep knowledge of the stars, ocean currents, and bird migrations. These ancient mariners were able to locate and settle islands scattered across thousands of kilometers of open sea. The discovery of Rapa Nui itself was part of this extraordinary wave of exploration that carried Polynesians to the farthest reaches of the Pacific.\n\nPanorama of Anakena beach, Easter Island. Image via Wiki Commons.\n\nWhat makes the new research so exciting is that it pushes the boundaries of what we thought Polynesians were capable of. The discovery of indigenous American genetic markers in the genomes of ancient Rapanui individuals provides the first clear proof that Polynesians did indeed make contact with the Americas.\n\nThe genetic evidence suggests that the contact between Polynesians and indigenous South Americans was not a chance encounter. A genetic admixture event \u2014 where indigenous American DNA entered the Polynesian gene pool \u2014 occurred sometime between 1250 and 1430 CE. This timeline coincides with the height of Polynesian seafaring when long-distance voyages were regularly undertaken to discover and settle new lands.\n\nIt is likely that these early navigators reached the western coast of South America, possibly modern-day Chile or Peru, where they made contact with indigenous populations. The genetic data indicates that the indigenous American ancestry in the Rapanui people is most closely related to populations from the Central Andes, supporting the idea that Polynesians landed on the coast, met Andean peoples, and either intermarried or exchanged individuals between groups before returning to Rapa Nui.\n\nWere There Return Trips?\n\nOne of the most tantalizing questions raised by this research is whether the Polynesians, after reaching South America, made return trips to Rapa Nui. The Polynesians certainly had sufficiently advanced navigational skills to allow for two-way voyages. Oral traditions from other Polynesian islands tell of round-trip voyages covering thousands of kilometers. They made these trips to retrieve people, animals, or resources. However, direct evidence of return trips between Rapa Nui and South America was pretty elusive.\n\nWhat the genetic evidence does show is that the admixture between South Americans and the Polynesian population of Rapa Nui occurred in a narrow time frame. This suggests that this was a single, significant event rather than the result of ongoing interaction over centuries. It\u2019s possible that while Polynesians made it to South America and back, the voyages were not routine or frequent.\n\nStill, the very fact that such a voyage occurred \u2014 whether a one-way or round-trip journey \u2014 demonstrates the extraordinary capabilities of the Polynesian navigators. Their ability to sail across vast, open ocean spaces without modern instruments remains one of the greatest achievements in human exploration.\n\nBut how did they do it? And what was the nature of their contact? Genetic evidence can\u2019t tell us all of that, unfortunately.\n\nCould the islanders actually have managed intense resource shortages? Image credits: Rita Willaert.\n\nA Resilient Rapanui population\n\nThe ecocide hypothesis was the dominant one for years. It was a compelling cautionary story: a population on an isolated island used up all its resources and then collapsed.\n\nYet studies are casting some doubt on the story of a population collapse. Earlier this year, a paper using radiocarbon and archaeological evidence also concluded that the Rapanui were more resilient than previously thought.\n\n\u201cWe specifically reject the hypothesis that such changes in Rapa Nui resulted in population collapse in the 1600s, before European contact. Instead, our results support that the Rapanui population was resilient despite a changing environment,\u201d the researchers conclude in their study.\n\nFor the people of Rapa Nui, this research is more than just a scientific discovery \u2014 it\u2019s a chance to reclaim a piece of their history. The study\u2019s findings confirm that the ancestors of today\u2019s Rapanui were not isolated islanders but part of a broader network of explorers who bridged the Pacific Ocean and withstood great adversity.\n\nThe research also contributes to ongoing efforts to repatriate ancestral remains to Rapa Nui. The main genetic evidence came from 15 ancient individuals who were in museums abroad. The findings provide support for the Rapanui community\u2019s campaign to have their ancestors returned to the island from museums abroad.\n\nLastly, this is also a story about the progress of science. This study was only possible thanks to advances in genomic technology. The ability to sequence ancient DNA from human remains has opened new frontiers in our understanding of prehistory.\n\nAs more genomic data becomes available, it\u2019s likely that other instances of pre-European contact between distant populations will be uncovered. Already, the discovery of Polynesian chickens in pre-Columbian archaeological sites in Chile suggests that the exchange between Polynesians and indigenous Americans extended beyond just people \u2014 it might have included the transfer of plants, animals, and technology as well.\n\nThe study \u201cAncient Rapanui genomes reveal resilience and pre-European contact with the Americas\u201d was published in Nature."

        "article_content": "Sitting in Athens during the first COVID-19 lockdown, entrepreneur Rania Lamprou watched as online e-commerce exploded because of social distancing. But merchants still struggled with low conversion rates because their checkout processes were complicated, and they had to integrate multiple providers for payments, shipping, and loyalty programs. \u201cI knew there had to be a better way to reduce friction for both merchants and customers,\u201d she told TechCrunch. Why not turn the checkout process into a \u201cCheckout-as-a-Service\u201d platform that streamlined it for both merchants and shoppers? She started coding in Python.\n\nBut, she wasn\u2019t wasn\u2019t alone. Tech giants Shop Pay and Bolt were in the same space, but were focusing on the U.S. market, less so Europe. The former had started back in 2014 and has now raised a total of $982.1 million. So what was Lamprou going to do with her tiny startup, which she\u2019d named Simpler?\n\nShe brought on two co-founders she\u2019d known from university, Alex Kyriakopoulos and Spyros Mandekis, started building the team, and they raised their first $1 million pre-seed round.\n\n\u201cYes, Bolt is a big, massive company, yes. But they are focused on the U.S., mostly with handling fraud problems, like chargebacks which is a very big problem in the U.S., but it\u2019s not so much in Europe,\u201d she told TechCrunch over a call.\n\nIn Europe, she said, there are different issues: \u201cWe have to localize and add all these different solutions, different providers. Every country has different needs, customer preferences, different different payment providers, loyalty coupons, etc.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s important because European e-commerce experienced a boost with a 66% sales increase from 2019 to 2021. Despite a temporary decline, the market is expected to keep growing, potentially reaching $955 billion by 2028.\n\nThe solution turned out to be elegant.\n\nOn Simpler, merchants can fully outsource payments, shipping, and loyalty programs into one system, boosting conversions and reducing complexity. For shoppers, it means a one-click buying experience across multiple stores and channels, making shopping literally simpler.\n\nSimpler is a low/no-code solution that can be integrated quickly, while shoppers get a one-click buying convenience, but across different merchants and channels.\n\nNow Simpler has over 250 merchants, more than half a million shoppers registered, and expects to 10x its revenue by end of 2025, said Lamprou. It\u2019s also raised a \u20ac9 million / $10 million in a late-seed / pre-Series A, doubling down on the U.K., Italy, and Spain. Participating in the round were VentureFriends, MMC Ventures, and Lamda Development.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing strong demand from both SMEs and enterprise-level businesses as we expand across Europe,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Shop Pay is exclusive to Shopify, Simpler is designed for all platforms. And, unlike Bolt, which focuses heavily on the U.S. market, Simpler is targeting the U.K. and Europe, tailoring its approach to the unique needs of these markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a robust end-to-end solution with three orders of magnitude less funding than Bolt,\u201d she added, with a hint of a smile."

        "article_content": "Josh Reynolds is a dagger expert.\n\nThat\u2019s \u201cdagger\u201d as in the NFL passing concept, of course.\n\nIn Detroit, Reynolds got all the glory on the play. Somebody else handled the clear-out vertical, running a safety down the field to create a void about 18-20 yards past the line of scrimmage, a couple of yards inside the numbers.\n\nThen Reynolds, lined up outside, would run a deep in-cut into that void, find the ball and make hay.\n\n\u201cThat was one of my routes, for sure. I was the dagger,\u201d Reynolds told The Denver Post.\n\nNow in Denver, he\u2019s the clear-out man. The ball never goes to that guy.\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019ve seen in eight years,\u201d he said.\n\nThis is the dirty work. Like an off-the-ball screen to free up a shooter in basketball or a rugged forward jostling for position in front of a goaltender in hockey.\n\n\u201cLove of the game route, man,\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\nCourtland Sutton is the Broncos\u2019 dagger man.\n\nHe starts outside of Reynolds when the Broncos run this tried-and-true zone-beater. Gets up the field, lets Reynolds do his thing, then snaps inside. During camp and the preseason, rookie quarterback Bo Nix showed an affinity for the play, hitting Sutton on his route in rhythm time and time again.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fast dude,\u201d Reynolds said of Sutton. \u201cHe\u2019s a fast dude that can stick his foot in the ground and come flat. That\u2019s the whole key to running dagger.\u201d\n\nSo far in the regular season, though, Denver\u2019s passing game has been blunted. Their production on dagger and Sutton\u2019s production as a whole? Duller than anticipated.\n\nSutton\u2019s got five catches on 16 targets through two games and just 64 yards. With a small sample size, one big game can turn those numbers around, but the early per-game and per-target rates are well off Sutton\u2019s career norms.\n\nMore pertinent so far is the general inability to get the ball into Sutton\u2019s hands in the first place. Nix targeted him 12 times in Week 1 at Seattle but he only finished with four catches. Then against Pittsburgh, the ball didn\u2019t even get thrown in Sutton\u2019s direction until midway through the third quarter.\n\n\u201cThere are routes when he\u2019s primary and you\u2019re hoping that you catch the right look and he gets the throw. It doesn\u2019t always work like that,\u201d offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a big part of every game plan and sometimes the flow of the game is such that he doesn\u2019t get the throws like we thought he would.\u201d\n\nOf course, given the overall issues the Broncos have had offensively, nobody is off to a blazing start. But Sutton\u2019s pace out of the gates is noteworthy particularly because of his offseason \u2014 he skipped all voluntary team activities to advocate for a contract extension that never came \u2014 and because he looked terrific during training camp.\n\nNow, though, it\u2019s a struggle.\n\nNix has thrown three interceptions while targeting Sutton. The receiver could have been credited with a target on the final-play pick Nix threw against Pittsburgh, too.\n\n\u201cHe plays \u2018X\u2019, but he can play other spots,\u201d head coach Sean Payton said of Sutton. \u201cA lot of (the lack of production) gets back to the third downs. (Wednesday night) we\u2019ll be game-planning third down and we have to be better in that area to add more snaps throughout the course of the game.\u201d\n\nIndeed, half of Sutton\u2019s targets so far have come on third down and on those snaps, Nix is 2 of 8 for 43 yards and a pick.\n\nLast year, Sutton caught eight of his 10 touchdowns in the red zone. Through two games this year: One catch on five targets for 10 yards, two interceptions and another that was nearly picked.\n\nSutton is a moneymaker in the intermediate part of the field. He\u2019s a big target and he\u2019s got the ability to create space, but he\u2019s not the type of receiver to flat run by a defensive back.\n\nDagger is a perfect example.\n\nNix has tried him on it three times already in two games. Against Seattle, Nix airmailed the first and then the second came up short because of pressure up the middle. Finally, against Pittsburgh, they got the look they wanted and Nix pinned a perfect ball on him for 26 yards.\n\nOverall, though, anything beyond 5 yards in the air has been inconsistent at best for Nix and the Denver offense.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s one thing,\u201d Lombardi said. \u201cI think it\u2019s everything working together \u2014 timing, protection routes. There\u2019s not one thing that goes into it. It\u2019s like most things on offense, it\u2019s 11 guys working together.\u201d\n\nUntil they do, Sutton will likely continue to operate in a kind of limbo.\n\nHe\u2019s in that mode career-wise, too.\n\nDenver added up to $1.5 million in incentives for him to end what he described as an offseason \u201cstalemate.\u201d If the Broncos\u2019 offense wallows, though, that\u2019s money he won\u2019t see much or any of.\n\nA recent under-the-radar move could impact his future roster status, too.\n\nDenver in Week 1 made Sutton more expensive to cut or trade after the season but also took a spring or summer extension off the table.\n\nTight on cap space but wanting to sign cornerback Pat Surtain II to a mega extension, the Broncos created room by converting $11.875 million of Sutton\u2019s $13 million base salary to signing bonus. Importantly, they also added three void years to his contract to maximize the cap savings in the short term.\n\nThat contract adjustment, though, means Sutton is now ineligible for an extension for a year due to a rule that says contracts can\u2019t be renegotiated more than once per 12 months.\n\nSo now Sutton carries a $20.2 million cap hit for 2025, per OvertheCap. The Broncos could save $6.875 million if they cut him after this season but would incur $13.325 million in dead cap, too. That\u2019s nearly $10 million more than before the contract adjustment and that prorated bonus money would stay on the books if the Broncos traded him, too.\n\nSimultaneously, though, the sides couldn\u2019t formalize a contract extension until the 2025 regular season even if they wanted to.\n\nThat will be more pertinent in January than it is now. For the moment, the focus is just on getting the Broncos\u2019 top receiver going.\n\nPerhaps it will start with a dagger.\n\nWant more Broncos news?

        "article_content": "Company Logo\n\nDublin, Sept. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Saudi Arabia Video Conferencing Software Market, By Region, Competition, Forecast and Opportunities, 2019-2029F\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia's Video Conferencing Software Market was valued at USD 345.2 million in 2023 and is anticipated to project robust growth in the forecast period with a CAGR of 30.4% through 2029.\n\nThe Saudi Arabia video conferencing software market is currently experiencing significant growth and transformation. This surge can be attributed to various factors, with the foremost being the global COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the adoption of remote work and the need for efficient virtual communication tools.\n\nBusinesses, educational institutions, and government agencies have all turned to video conferencing software to maintain operations and ensure seamless collaboration in an increasingly digital landscape. Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 initiative, which aims to diversify the country's economy, has prompted investments in digital infrastructure and technology. As a result, businesses are actively embracing video conferencing solutions to enhance productivity and connectivity.\n\nThe market is witnessing fierce competition, with both established players and new entrants vying for a share of the growing demand. Moreover, the country's young and tech-savvy population is driving the adoption of digital communication tools. Overall, the Saudi Arabia video conferencing software market presents lucrative opportunities for innovation, growth, and development as organizations seek to adapt to the evolving work environment and stay competitive on a global scale.\n\nRiyadh emerged as the dominant region in the Saudi Arabia Video Conferencing Software Market, and it is expected to maintain its supremacy during the forecast period. Riyadh, the capital city and the central business hub of Saudi Arabia, plays a pivotal role in steering the adoption of video conferencing software. The city houses a significant concentration of corporate enterprises, government agencies, educational institutions, and healthcare facilities, all of which intensified their reliance on video conferencing tools, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe demand for video conferencing software in Riyadh was further accentuated by the region's rapid urbanization, extensive digital infrastructure, and well-established connectivity, making it exceptionally well-suited for the seamless implementation of virtual communication solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nLooking ahead, Riyadh is poised to continue its dominance in the Saudi Arabia Video Conferencing Software Market during the forecast period. As organizations in the region maintain a strong emphasis on remote work, digital transformation, and enhanced communication, the demand for video conferencing software will remain high. The region's position as the economic, administrative, and educational nucleus of the country reaffirms its role as the primary driver of growth and innovation in the video conferencing software market, solidifying its leadership in the coming years.\n\n\n\nKey Market Trends\n\nHybrid Work Environments\n\n\n\nOne prominent market trend in the video conferencing software sector in Saudi Arabia is the increasing adoption of hybrid work environments. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations have adopted a flexible work model that combines in-office and remote work. This trend is expected to persist as it offers benefits such as improved work-life balance and access to a broader talent pool.\n\nVideo conferencing software has become a linchpin in this shift, facilitating communication and collaboration between on-site and remote team members. As a result, providers are focusing on features that support hybrid work, including enhanced mobile accessibility, integration with project management tools, and the optimization of in-person and virtual meeting experiences. The ability to seamlessly bridge the gap between physical and digital workspaces is a crucial trend shaping the market in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nAI-Powered Features\n\n\n\nAnother notable trend in the Saudi Arabian video conferencing software market is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities. AI-powered features are increasingly being incorporated to enhance the user experience. These features include automated transcription and translation services, real-time language translation, intelligent background blur, noise cancellation, and facial recognition for enhanced security.\n\nAI-driven analytics are also used to monitor user engagement and overall meeting performance. In a highly competitive market, providers are leveraging AI to differentiate their offerings and provide users with smart, efficient, and personalized video conferencing experiences, aligning with the broader trend of technology enhancement through AI.\n\n\n\nWebinar and Virtual Events Expansion\n\n\n\nThe demand for webinars and virtual events has surged in Saudi Arabia, resulting in a significant trend in the video conferencing software market. Organizations are utilizing video conferencing platforms to host webinars, workshops, and virtual events, aiming to engage with larger audiences for marketing, training, and educational purposes. This trend has led to the development of specialized features for managing large-scale events, including audience interaction tools, registration and ticketing integration, and analytics to measure attendee engagement.\n\nProviders are also expanding their capabilities to support exhibitor booths, virtual trade shows, and networking opportunities within the context of virtual events. The increasing importance of these features highlights the growing role of video conferencing software in facilitating online events and knowledge sharing in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nCustomization and White-Label Solutions\n\n\n\nCustomization and white-labeling have emerged as a significant trend in the Saudi Arabian video conferencing software market. Organizations are seeking solutions that can be tailored to their specific branding, workflows, and requirements. White-label solutions, in particular, allow companies to present the software as their own, providing a seamless and consistent user experience. This trend is driven by a desire for branding consistency, enhanced user engagement, and the creation of a more professional and unified online presence.\n\nAs a response to this demand, many video conferencing software providers are offering APIs and SDKs that enable businesses to embed video conferencing capabilities into their applications or platforms while maintaining a customized and branded look and feel. This trend reflects the growing need for adaptable and personalized solutions in the Saudi Arabian market.\n\n\n\nFocus on Data Privacy and Compliance\n\n\n\nData privacy and compliance have gained significant importance as a market trend in the Saudi Arabian video conferencing software sector. With increased concerns about data security and privacy, both organizations and individuals are seeking assurances that their information is adequately protected. In response, video conferencing software providers are enhancing their security measures and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. They are also working on providing end-to-end encryption and offering features like secure guest access and multi-factor authentication.\n\nGiven the evolving landscape of data protection, addressing these concerns is not only a matter of market trend but also a regulatory requirement in Saudi Arabia. This trend underscores the importance of trust and transparency in the market as organizations and individuals seek video conferencing solutions that prioritize data privacy and security.\n\nReport Scope\n\n\n\nIn this report, the Saudi Arabia Video Conferencing Software Market has been segmented into the following categories, in addition to the industry trends which have also been detailed, below:\n\n\n\nBy Type:\n\nHardware\n\nSoftware\n\nServices\n\nBy Deployment:\n\nOn-premise\n\nHybrid\n\nCloud\n\nBy Industry Vertical:\n\nCorporate Enterprise\n\nGovernment & Defense\n\nHealthcare\n\nEducation\n\nManufacturing\n\nOthers\n\nBy Region:\n\nRiyadh\n\nMakkah\n\nMadinah\n\nJeddah\n\nTabuk\n\nEastern Province\n\nRest of Saudi Arabia\n\nA selection of companies mentioned in this report includes, but is not limited to:\n\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\nCisco Systems, Inc.\n\nZoom Video Communications, Inc.\n\nGoogle LLC\n\nBlueJeans Network, LLC\n\nAdobe Inc.\n\nHuawei Technologies Co.

        "article_content": "Project Management Software Stocks Q2 Highlights: Asana (NYSE:ASAN)\n\nLet\u2019s dig into the relative performance of Asana (NYSE:ASAN) and its peers as we unravel the now-completed Q2 project management software earnings season.\n\nThe future of work requires teams to collaborate across departments and remote offices. Project management software is both driving this change and benefiting from it. While the trend of collaborative work management has been strong for a while, the Covid pandemic has definitively accelerated the demand for tools that allow work to be done remotely.\n\nThe 4 project management software stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.2% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line.\n\nThe Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\n\nIn light of this news, project management software stocks have held steady with share prices up 2.6% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nAsana (NYSE:ASAN)\n\nFounded in 2008 by Facebook\u2019s co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, Asana (NYSE:ASAN) is a cloud-based project management software, where you can plan and assign tasks to employees and monitor and discuss progress of work.\n\nAsana reported revenues of $179.2 million, up 10.3% year on year. This print was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, but overall, it was a slower quarter for the company with a miss of analysts\u2019 billings estimates and full-year revenue guidance missing analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\n\u201cIn Q2, Asana continued to execute on our enterprise transition and make significant strides in AI. We're seeing momentum in key areas, including 17% growth in customers spending over $100,000, success in key verticals, and a record number of multi-year deals,\u201d said Dustin Moskovitz, co-founder and chief executive officer of Asana.\n\nAsana Total Revenue\n\nAsana delivered the slowest revenue growth of the whole group. The company added 786 enterprise customers paying more than $5,000 annually to reach a total of 22,948. Unsurprisingly, the stock is down 7.2% since reporting and currently trades at $12.32.\n\nRead our full report on Asana here, it\u2019s free.\n\nBest Q2: Monday.com (NASDAQ:MNDY)\n\nFounded in Israel in 2014, and named after the dreaded first day of the work week, Monday.com (NASDAQ:MNDY) makes software as a service platform that helps teams plan and track work efficiently.\n\nStory continues\n\nMonday.com reported revenues of $236.1 million, up 34.4% year on year, outperforming analysts\u2019 expectations by 3%. The business had a strong quarter with a solid beat of analysts\u2019 ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates and full-year revenue guidance topping analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nMonday.com Total Revenue\n\nMonday.com scored the biggest analyst estimates beat, fastest revenue growth, and highest full-year guidance raise among its peers. The company added 222 enterprise customers paying more than $50,000 annually to reach a total of 2,713. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 21.3% since reporting. It currently trades at $273.83.\n\nIs now the time to buy Monday.com?

It was a slower quarter as it posted underwhelming revenue guidance for the next quarter and management forecasting growth to slow.\n\nAtlassian delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and weakest full-year guidance update in the group. As expected, the stock is down 7% since the results and currently trades at $161.19.\n\nRead our full analysis of Atlassian\u2019s results here.\n\nSmartsheet (NYSE:SMAR)\n\nFounded in 2005, Smartsheet (NYSE:SMAR) is a software as a service platform that helps companies plan, manage and report on work.\n\nSmartsheet reported revenues of $276.4 million, up 17.3% year on year. This number was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations. More broadly, it was a mixed quarter as it also recorded accelerating growth in large customers but full-year revenue guidance missing analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe company added 221 enterprise customers paying more than $5,000 annually to reach a total of 20,198. The stock is up 3.4% since reporting and currently trades at $51.01.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Smartsheet here, it\u2019s free.\n\nJoin Paid Stock Investor Research\n\nHelp us make StockStory more helpful to investors like yourself.
