        "article_content": "During my first two months at Yale, I\u2019ve learned how to be an indulgent skeptic.\n\nThe Thursday before Family Weekend, I received an email advertising an 11-hour-long teach-in about UFOs, to which I responded with immediate incredulity. I wasn\u2019t quite sure that \u201cfree exchange of ideas surrounding a challenging subject\u201d could apply to government cover-ups of UFOs, a conspiracy theory seemingly on par with the flat Earth.\n\nI decided to reach out to Sydney Morrison \u201925, the leader of the Yale Student UFO Society, or YSUS, to find out what could lead a Yale student to believe that little green men in flying saucers were anything but pure science fiction. After a few back-and-forth emails, she explained her reasoning over lunch last Monday.\n\nSydney\u2019s story with ufology, the study of UFOs, began during her time away from Yale after her sophomore year. Throughout her childhood and teenage years, her idea of UFOs was much like mine: \u201cpotentially some weird spiritual thing, like a semi-religious phenomenon.\u201d But one night, while hanging out with a friend in a Washington park, they turned around simultaneously to see a large object with blinking lights in the sky. Unbothered at first, they then encountered an 8-foot-tall bulky humanoid object with two deer-like eyes, casually strolling around and absorbing all visible light entering its body. Sydney said that they got within two feet of the alien, which continued to stomp around and followed them back to their car.\n\nNaturally, this experience was \u201cpretty shaking,\u201d and Sydney started YSUS her next semester back at Yale to create a space for UFO believers \u2014 the only such space in the Ivy League. The club\u2019s main goal is to consolidate and present knowledge on UFO sightings.\n\nConvincing those in the Yale community is more of a secondary objective. Sydney explained that when talking about her experience to people outside the ufology community, she always begins with \u201cI know this sounds crazy\u201d or \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have believed it myself,\u201d but it\u2019s often unsuccessful; she\u2019s mostly given up on convincing people to believe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such pervasive stigma that associates UFOs with mental illness,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s scary when you do try to take [beliefs about UFOs] further into the media and the public.\u201d\n\nI felt sympathetic to her cause. If UFOs were to exist, I \u2014 and most of the world \u2014 would be virtually clueless, having been deaf to all those who claimed to have seen evidence. Sydney often wishes she hadn\u2019t had her sighting \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s kind of like the Matrix, where you can\u2019t go back after you\u2019ve seen something like that,\u201d she said. Personally, I\u2019d rather live my life unaware of any alien existence \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine being so utterly sure of a truth that my family and friends would never accept.\n\nCurious about what led other students to join the club \u2014 to voluntarily take the red pill \u2014 I talked to Lorenzo Chamberlin \u201928, YSUS\u2019s newest officer. He told me that he saw a poster advertising YSUS on the way to class one day and was immediately drawn to it. He\u2019s never had an experience with UFOs, though he would like to, and was enthusiastic about the club\u2019s efforts to find \u201cways to have those experiences.\u201d He quoted Sherlock Holmes to summarize his reason for joining: \u201conce you\u2019ve eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that Lorenzo wrote the original teach-in email that piqued my curiosity. Rereading it after our chat, I realized that his description of the event\u2019s purpose \u2014 raising awareness for \u201cwider epistemological challenges to accepted boundaries of scholarship and civic activism\u201d \u2014 was not a half-baked attempt at intellectualizing a joke but a genuine reflection on how deep our assumptions lie.\n\nOver the course of our lunch, Sydney presented a logical, well-thought-out argument. By the time she brought up postcolonialism and ontology, it was clear that she\u2019d spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours researching ufology.\n\nWe talked for around an hour, but most people don\u2019t devote that much time to understanding a claim viewed as fundamentally absurd. It\u2019s so easy to just dismiss someone as crazy when that\u2019s what the rest of the world thinks.\n\nIn my philosophy and astronomy courses, I\u2019ve learned about dozens of breakthroughs that were met with universal skepticism when they were first made. Ideas like philosophical questioning, the heliocentric theory and special relativity were incredibly controversial when proposed because they disrupted beliefs that felt safe and secure. Socrates, Galileo and Einstein \u2014 some of the most important contributors to human knowledge \u2014 were all shunned for their \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cpreposterous\u201d findings.\n\nSo maybe \u2014 however unlikely \u2014 UFOs are real and Sydney is the next Einstein. I\u2019m not quite convinced, but I\u2019ve learned to at least give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Nothing is for certain, and so to make a leap into the unknown, to challenge centuries of knowledge and billions of people, should be seen not as ignorance but bravery."

Chief among them is Adobe, whose Terms of Service debacle in the summer led to a fierce backlash from creatives. But the brand's latest move might just help ingratiate the company with AI-sceptics.\n\nThe company has announced a new Content Authenticity Web App designed to \"champion creator protection and attribution\". An extension of the Content Authenticity Initiative we've already seen Adobe develop over the last couple of years, the new web app offers a free way for creators to apply content credentials to their work.\n\nAdobe\n\nAs well as adding credentials, the web app lets creators set AI training and usage preferences, essentially letting artists opt-out of being trained by models. Of course, this relies on other models recognising this, but Adobe is \"actively working to drive industry-wide adoption of this preference.\"\n\nA free, public beta of the Adobe Content Authenticity web app will be available in Q1 2025, and users can sign up for more information here. As well as the web app, there'll also be a handy Chrome extension for inspecting credentials.\n\nAdobe Content Credentials web app\n\n\"Adobe\u2019s new tool for signing artwork is a game-changer,\" gushes illustrator Pepita Sandwich via the Adobe website. \"It makes adding Content Credentials to digital pieces easy and professional. The interface is intuitive and ensures seamless integration, while the security features give me peace of mind. I also love that it offers the option to opt-out of AI training\u2014perfect for protecting my creative rights.\"\n\nIt's certainly a timely move for a company that has endured its fair share of criticism from artists this year, as well as facing the small matter of getting sued by the US government over its convoluted cancellation processes. But with the brand having previously committed to \"doing the right thing\" when it comes to AI, focussing its efforts on the Content Authenticity Initiative seems like a wise move."

        "article_content": "The bomb that was \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\u201d loomed large over this past weekend, but further down the box office tally lies a success story: the limited-release documentary \u201cSam and Colby: The Legends of the Paranormal\u201d finished sixth despite playing to just 350 screens nationwide.\n\nThis feat is just the latest example of YouTubers finding mainstream traction through horror \u2014 a genre that has been one of the most eclectic and innovative corners of YouTube \u2014 though the platform has made it increasingly difficult for some of these creators to reach audiences.\n\nOriginally launching a general vlogging channel in 2014, Sam and Colby gained most of their 13 million subscribers after going all in on paranormal investigation videos. The pair\u2019s most popular videos are one-to-two-hour explorations of such iconic haunts as the Stanley Hotel (43 million views), the Queen Mary (22 million views) and the house that inspired \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d (39 million views).\n\nA staple of Sam and Colby\u2019s channel is Hell Week, an annual tradition where the pair release their biggest and scariest project of the year each October. Last year\u2019s limited 168-theater run with Cinemark for their \u201cConjuring\u201d house series sold out at every location, and so the duo upped the distribution to 350 screens for \u201cLegends.\u201d\n\nBox Office Mojo estimates \u201cLegends\u201d grossed around $1.76 million over the weekend, even with the movie playing to the fewest number of theaters in the top 10. The high fan turnout generated an average of nearly $6,000 per theater.\n\nSam and Colby\u2019s box office win speaks to the unassuming power of niche yet large online communities and the ability of online content to compete with mainstream entertainment \u2014 something on which Michael Bay is banking as he preps \u201cSkibidi Toilet\u201d for the big leagues.\n\nBut it\u2019s also just the latest instance of horror-focused creators jumping from YouTube to the mainstream. Last year saw the release of A24\u2019s \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d the acclaimed debut film written and directed by Danny and Michael Philippou, better known as RackaRacka to their 6.86 million YouTube subscribers.\n\nPremiering the week after \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d weekend, \u201dTalk to Me\u201d not only went on to earn over $92 million globally but it\u2019s A24\u2019s third-highest-grossing film behind Best Picture winner \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d and summer blockbuster \u201cCivil War.\u201d\n\nThe success of \u201cTalk to Me\u201d has seemingly opened the floodgates for scare-inclined creators to reach audiences beyond YouTube. A24 is looking to YouTube again for its next horror hit, this time striking a deal with 18-year-old Ken Parsons for a film based on his \u201climinal space\u201d-inspired \u201cBackrooms\u201d series.\n\nCurry Barker, who has made online waves with his award-winning short horror films (most recently the unsettling \u201cMilk & Serial,\u201d inspired by YouTube prank channels), is currently working on a full-length feature with \u201c47 Meters Down\u201d producer James Harris. In the meantime, YouTube film critic Chris Stuckmann\u2019s debut supernatural feature \u201cShelby Oaks,\u201d which raised over $1 million on Kickstarter, will be released by Neon next year.\n\nIt should be noted that this new era of online-bred scares hardly came out of nowhere. Horror is one of YouTube\u2019s most prolific genres, and its presence on the platform spans as far back as YouTube itself.\n\nAs a film genre, horror is often associated with low budgets, scrappy filmmaking and craftiness in the face of technical limitations \u2014 qualities that can also be applied to YouTubers, especially in the early \u201cBroadcast Yourself\u201d days. Some of the site\u2019s first viral scripted series, such as \u201cLonelygirl15\u201d and \"Marble Hornets,\u201d adapted \u201cfound footage\u201d-style horror for the vlogging era, sparking fierce online debates over whether these shows were real.\n\nDuring the 2010s, BuzzFeed\u2019s \u201cUnsolved\u201d series adapted the supernatural reality show format \u2014 a well-performing, if famously embellished, staple of cable \u2014 for online audiences, becoming one of the content studio\u2019s most beloved titles. The show\u2019s creator, Ryan Bergara, and co-host Shane Madej even leveraged the popularity of \u201cUnsolved\u201d to launch their own production company, Watcher Entertainment, alongside fellow BuzzFeed creator Steven Lim.\n\nToday, unscripted paranormal investigations are a fixture on YouTube. Offerings like Sam and Colby\u2019s or Watcher\u2019s \u201cGhost/Mystery Files,\u201d the spiritual successor to \u201cBuzzFeed Unsolved,\u201d regularly thrill millions with ghost hunts and paranormal encounters. Even non-horror YouTubers will occasionally embark on a ghost hunt for easy views.\n\nBut the biggest innovations for the horror genre are still coming from ambitious filmmakers including RackaRacka and Barker, despite YouTube\u2019s algorithm and monetization policy becoming more restrictive over the years. As part of its bid to keep advertisers happy and shed its amateurish reputation, YouTube is far from the wild West, anything-goes video platform that allowed creators to get gory in the 2000s and early 2010s.\n\nAs a result, creators of all genres are subject to the same monetization rules, which generally favor family-friendly content. The guys behind RackaRacka have even said they make little to no money on their videos \u2014 breakneck, bloody and stunt-fueled horror comedies \u2014 despite the millions of views on each.\n\nOn top of potentially being demonetized, more provocative creators also must contend with age-restriction warnings, which require users to sign into their YouTube account to confirm their age before watching the video. The issue is less about forcing users to sign in, and more that the ability for the video to be picked up by YouTube\u2019s algorithm and reach new audiences is drastically reduced. Creators can manually mark their videos as 18+, but that still impacts each one\u2019s standing in the algorithm and access to ad placement.\n\nYouTube\u2019s automation is also known to automatically age-restrict generally inoffensive videos \u2014 ones containing too many swear words, for instance \u2014 putting creators\u2019 livelihoods at risk. YouTube did loosen some of its monetization rules following creator backlash last year, but the constantly changing policies are still something creators need to tiptoe around.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, YouTube offers horror creators a platform to experiment, build a following and potentially break through. YouTube has also introduced additional income streams for creators outside of ads, including revenue from YouTube Premium and paid channel memberships in the vein of Patreon.\n\n\u201cWe welcome a variety of content and expression on YouTube, but not all videos are a fit for all advertisers, such as content that is age-restricted,\u201d said a spokesperson for the company. \u201cIn recent years, we have taken steps to increase transparency around our advertiser-friendly guidelines and have opened up new monetization opportunities, like channel memberships for creators whose content may not suit all advertisers. We\u2019ll continue to listen to the creator community about how we can support their success.\u201d\n\nAs YouTube takes on major streaming platforms, transforms its TV app into a full-on streaming platform and advocates for major awards recognition on behalf of its creators, it would be remiss to leave its horror-leaning creators out of the conversation.\n\nEven the most non-advertiser-friendly corners of the genre still generate passionate fandoms, and films like \u201cTalk to Me\u201d \u2014 and even \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s,\u201d the indie horror game turned major franchise thanks to a fervent YouTube fanbase \u2014 prove that wider audiences are interested.\n\nAnd when it comes to the content itself, the quality is there. Barker\u2019s short films wouldn\u2019t look out of place next to Netflix\u2019s horror offerings. All YouTube has to do now is give these creators greater license to scare the hell out of more people."

        "article_content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution continues to tout developing drugs faster and at lower cost, but are we there yet?\n\nOn October 2nd, the FDA cleared an investigational new drug (IND) application for a Phase I/II clinical trial of REC-1245, a new chemical entity for the treatment of biomarker-enriched solid tumors and lymphoma, developed by Recursion, the long-standing AI in drug discovery company founded in 2013.\n\nRecursion states that REC-1245 is the first program using the company\u2019s end-to-end AI platform, spanning discovery, biology, chemistry, and the clinic. According to Chris Gibson, CEO of Recursion, the potential therapeutic progressed from novel target biology to preclinical drug candidate in under 18 months, \u201cnearly twice the speed of the industry average.\u201d\n\nREC-1245 is a selective degrader of RBM39, a new target, identified by Recursion\u2019s AI-enabled Maps of Biology platform, with a similar biological function to the well-known but hard-to-drug target, CDK12. Preclinical data showed that RBM39 degradation induces splicing defects which downregulate DNA damage response (DDR) networks and cell cycle checkpoints, functional changes prevalent in cancer.\n\nMany investigational drugs designed to target CDK12 also inhibit the structurally similar CDK13, resulting in toxicity. In contrast, targeting RBM39 showed similar effects to the loss of CDK12 without affecting CDK13.\n\nIn an interview with GEN Edge, Simon Barnett, research director at Dimension, stated that drug discovery timeline compression can be a leading indicator of machine learning\u2019s (ML) capabilities. At the same time, proof points are just starting to come in, and \u201cit\u2019s still virtually impossible to say how ML-heavy discovery and development efforts are meaningfully warping phase transition likelihood.\u201d\n\nThat said, the industry will first hear about faster timelines before seeing drugs enter Phase II, Phase III, and achieve approval from these platforms.\n\n\u201cIn biotech, time is money, so it means something,\u201d said Barnett. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be one-off examples until we can corral many examples. We\u2019ll then have some real firepower behind these statements of what data-driven methods can do in life sciences.\u201d\n\nREC-1245 joins the Salt Lake City-based company\u2019s existing clinical pipeline, whose therapeutic areas span from precision oncology to rare disease. The Phase I/II clinical trial for REC-1245 is expected to initiate in Q4 2024. Recursion estimates that the initially addressable population for this potential therapeutic will be over 100,000 patients in the United States and EU5.\n\n\u201cRBM39 degraders may offer a promising therapeutic approach for patients with solid tumors, particularly those with limited treatment options,\u201d said Najat Khan, PhD, chief R&D officer and chief commercial officer at Recursion. \u201cThis mechanism provides new opportunities for targeting tumors, which are often resistant to conventional treatments.\u201d\n\nPrior to joining Recursion in April, Khan played an integral role in building leading therapeutic pipelines as chief data science officer and global head of strategy and portfolio organization R&D at Johnson & Johnson. GEN Edge caught up with Khan to reflect on REC-1245\u2019s IND approval, the evolution of Recursion\u2019s AI-based drug discovery platform, and what\u2019s next for the field.\n\nInterconnectedness like a highway\n\nWhile traditional drug discovery builds upon the literature of established targets, Recursion was founded on the mission to discover novel therapeutics by looking at the entirety of biological systems.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s critical to understand is not just whether one gene is driving a disease, but all the interconnectedness like a highway. There\u2019s beauty in understanding how perturbing one thing impacts the rest of the system,\u201d said Khan.\n\nAt the core of Recursion\u2019s technology is the Recursion Operating System (OS), a platform powered by the company\u2019s large proprietary phenomic datasets, spanning\n\ntranscriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and more. The platform leverages Maps of Biology, which create millions of biological relationships by perturbing human cell lines to instill a disease state and testing compounds to reverse the cells to healthy function. Machine learning algorithms then evaluate gene-gene and gene-compound associations of interest to identify novel drug targets, such as RBM39.\n\nKhan emphasized that starting with human cell lines in phenomics \u201cmakes a massive difference that doesn\u2019t get talked about enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cTranslation gap is one of the biggest issues we have in the industry because we don\u2019t have good models to predict human response,\u201d Khan told GEN Edge. \u201cHow can we start with human-centric models that are cost-effective and standardized? That\u2019s what phenomics allows us to do so that we\u2019re able to anticipate and optimize before we go into the clinic.\u201d\n\nEnd-to-end platform\n\nOver the past 18 months, Recursion has made strides in growing its end-to-end AI drug discovery platform.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that to truly bring value in many cases to the industry, you can\u2019t just optimize one of the hundred steps to discovering and developing a medicine. You have to optimize entire pathways of discovery and development,\u201d said Gibson in an interview with GEN Edge.\n\nIn 2023, Recursion acquired Cyclica and Valence, whose technologies enhanced proteome-wide prediction of small molecule-target interactions and low-data learning in drug design respectively.\n\nIn one of the largest M&A events in the AI drug discovery field in August, Recursion entered a definitive agreement to combine with U.K.-based Exscientia. According to Recursion, the agreement combined Recursion\u2019s scaled biology exploration for target identification with Exscientia\u2019s precision chemistry for lead optimization for a complementary pipeline. The company expects approximately 10 clinical readouts over the next 18 months and is leveraging four large partnerships with Roche-Genetech, Bayer, Sanofi, and Merck KGaA. These growing industrialized workflows also promote speed in automation, thereby contributing to lower costs.\n\nWhile these end-to-end platforms continue to build, the probability of success through the clinic in the drug discovery industry remains at approximately 10%. According to Gibson, the reason for this low statistic is \u201cnot because people aren\u2019t good at science but because biology is really, really, really complex.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole reason why we founded Recursion: To leverage sophisticated computational tools to disentangle these thousands of parameters of biology that no human can hold in their head,\u201d Gibson told GEN Edge. \u201cOur belief is that this approach is sound and that it will just take us time to be able to kind of get the flywheel moving and really start to show people.\u201d\n\nKhan concurs and highlights that \u201cquality is more important than quantity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have done enough in science and development to know not everything works, but we\u2019re going to focus on showing pivotal examples where we can make molecules, get them to the clinic, and benefit patients differently than anybody else can,\u201d said Khan.\n\nSo are we there yet? We\u2019re mapping out a fast-track road. While one-off drug candidates are not overturning the industry, they\u2019re one step forward toward a new drug discovery paradigm.\n\n*Najat Khan, PhD, will be the opening keynote speaker at GEN\u2019s inaugural virtual event, The State of AI in Drug Discovery, streaming on October 30th."

No-code platforms, equipped with codeless app design capabilities, empower your team to create and deploy apps without writing a single line of code.\n\nThis means that even team members who aren't traditionally tech-savvy can contribute to the app development process, significantly speeding up project timelines.\n\nImagine you're tasked with improving customer engagement through a new interactive app. With a codeless app design tool, you can drag and drop elements to assemble a prototype within hours, not weeks. This rapid prototyping accelerates development and allows for iterative testing and feedback, ensuring the final product meets user needs while aligning with your strategic goals.\n\nOptimal Flexibility with WYSIWYG App Builders\n\nA crucial element of digital transformation is flexibility\u2014the ability to pivot and tailor solutions in real-time as your business needs evolve. What You See Is What You Get, or WYSIWYG app builders, exemplify this flexibility. They allow you to build and edit your applications visually, seeing exactly how they'll appear to the end-users as you construct them.\n\nThis hands-on approach reduces misunderstandings and miscommunications between business departments and IT teams. For example, your marketing team can directly create landing pages and promotional apps, ensuring that the end design matches their vision without back-and-forth with developers.\n\nThis saves time and empowers your non-technical staff to execute their ideas independently.\n\nReducing Costs and Resource Allocation\n\nOne significant impact of no-code in your digital transformation strategy is cost reduction. Traditional app development involves significant investment in technical staff, extended development timelines, and often expensive fixes and iterations.\n\nNo-code platforms change this dynamic by minimizing the need for a large development team and reducing the dependency on external IT consultants or software development companies.\n\nIntegrating no-code tools into your strategy allows you to allocate your financial and human resources more efficiently. Savings on technical development can be redirected towards other critical areas, such as market research, customer experience improvements, or expansion strategies.\n\nMoreover, the ease of updating applications built with no-code tools means that maintaining and improving your digital assets becomes less costly and more manageable over time.\n\nDriving Business Agility and Competitive Advantage\n\nNo-code platforms give your business the agility to stay ahead of the curve. Because no-code development significantly shortens the time from concept to deployment, your business can respond more swiftly to market changes and emerging opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, no-code tools give you the competitive advantage of experimenting with and implementing new ideas quickly without substantial upfront investment.\n\nWhether it's testing a new customer service bot, a unique booking system, or a custom data analysis tool, no-code platforms let you innovate faster, learn quickly from real-world feedback, and iterate effectively.\n\nIntegrating no-code technology into your strategy offers a pathway to more than just technological advancement. It transforms your organizational culture. It democratizes technology creation, empowers your teams, and sprinkles both agility and innovation into your business.\n\nUsing no-code platforms is a no-brainer. They can dismantle traditional barriers to technology development, open up new avenues for growth, and position your business as a leader in the digital economy."

        "article_content": "Such is the world of luxury products, that customers for McLaren Automotive\u2019s newly announced $2.6 million W1 hypercar can now order a watch to match.\n\nThe fourth watch produced as a result of the long-term partnership between McLaren and luxury watchmaker Richard Mille, the RM 65-01 \u201cMcLaren W1 Edition\u201d was announced this week in a press conference at the carmaker\u2019s Woking headquarters.\n\nBilled as something approaching a hypercar for the wrist, the watch, which will cost 320,000 Swiss francs plus taxes ($373,300) is a tribute to the design language of the car, which was revealed to the world last Sunday. With a split-second chronograph movement and a couple of other tricks up its sleeve, it houses what Richard Mille says is the most complicated automatic movement it has ever produced.\n\nThe movement, which comprises 480 components, beats at a frequency of 5 Hz, enabling measurement of intervals to the nearest tenth of a second. The split-seconds function allows the wearer to time two concurrent events, so you\u2019ll know with pinpoint accuracy just how much faster you are than just about every other car on the road (or racetrack.) The pushers at 2, 4, and 10 o\u2019clock, shaped to mimic the W1\u2019s exhausts, control the chronograph, with their roles spelled out in McLaren's \u201cpapaya orange\u201d and a high-contrast shade of baby blue, but it\u2019s the fourth pusher in pure orange that will catch your eye.\n\nStart Me Up\n\nThis controls a very different function, unique to the RM 65 line. You could call it a \u201cjump start\u201d button\u2014something hopefully the W1 will never require. It\u2019s an instant winding mechanism, designed so that in the rare occurrence that the watch runs out of power, you can fire it up again with a few presses of your thumb.\n\nIt activates a rack-and-pinion mechanism that winds the mainspring without taking the watch off your wrist. Richard Mille says that 125 pushes would fully wind the watch, but it\u2019s intended to provide a quick boost rather than be a substitute for the automatic winding system\u2014which itself is highly complex, with a variable rotor that can be adjusted to suit the lifestyle of the wearer, according to the brand. Essentially, if you\u2019re an active sort it\u2019ll be set up to deliver less energy per rotation, and vice versa if you\u2019re more sedentary."

        "article_content": "Austin, Texas, has transform into one of the most vibrant startup ecosystems in the United States. Renowned for its lively culture, innovative spirit, and a wealth of resources, Austin stands out as a city where entrepreneurship thrives. This article delves into the elements that make Austin\u2019s startup culture unique and explores why it attracts entrepreneurs from across the globe.\n\nThe Austin Vibe: A Blend of Creativity and Innovation\n\nAustin\u2019s reputation as a hub for creativity plays a crucial role in its startup culture. The city is famously known as the \u201cLive Music Capital of the World,\u201d drawing artists, musicians, and creative thinkers.

The festival draws thousands of entrepreneurs, tech enthusiasts, and investors, creating networking opportunities that can propel startups to new heights. The city\u2019s laid-back atmosphere encourages collaboration, making it easier for entrepreneurs to connect and share ideas.\n\nA Supportive Community: Networking and Collaboration\n\nThe sense of community in Austin is another critical factor that distinguishes its startup culture. Entrepreneurs often describe the city as having a \u201cgive-first\u201d mentality, where experienced professionals willingly mentor newcomers. This collaborative spirit fosters an ecosystem where startups can thrive.\n\nOrganizations like Capital Factory, Techstars, and Austin Tech Alliance offer resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities to startups. These organizations host regular events, meetups, and pitch competitions, encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing. As a result, entrepreneurs can learn from each other\u2019s experiences and build valuable connections.\n\nAccess to Funding: Fueling Growth\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for startups is securing funding. Fortunately, Austin has become a magnet for investors. The city\u2019s reputation as a burgeoning tech hub attracts venture capitalists and angel investors eager to invest in promising startups.\n\nIn recent years, notable funding rounds have made headlines, with companies like Indeed, HomeAway, and Vimeo receiving significant investments. This influx of capital creates a fertile ground for new ventures to secure the financial backing they need to grow.\n\nMoreover, the presence of local incubators and accelerators provides startups with essential resources to refine their business models. These programs often include mentorship, workshops, and access to investor networks, enhancing a startup\u2019s chances of success.\n\nThe Talent Pool: A Skilled Workforce\n\nAustin\u2019s unique startup culture is also bolstered by its access to a diverse and skilled workforce. The city is home to several universities, including the University of Texas at Austin, which churns out a steady stream of graduates in fields like engineering, business, and computer science. This influx of talent ensures that startups have access to the skills they need to innovate and compete.\n\nFurthermore, the city\u2019s attractive lifestyle\u2014marked by a lower cost of living compared to coastal tech hubs\u2014lures professionals from around the country. Many individuals are drawn to Austin\u2019s vibrant arts scene, outdoor activities, and culinary offerings, making it an appealing place to work and live.\n\nDiversity and Inclusion: Fostering Innovation\n\nDiversity and inclusion are key pillars of Austin\u2019s startup culture. The city actively promotes initiatives aimed at supporting underrepresented founders. Programs such as DivInc and Women@Austin focus on providing resources and support to minority and female entrepreneurs.\n\nThis commitment to diversity not only creates a more inclusive startup ecosystem but also fosters innovation. Diverse teams bring a range of perspectives and ideas, leading to more creative problem-solving and better product development. As a result, Austin\u2019s startups are well-positioned to address a broad spectrum of market needs.\n\nThe Tech Scene: A Confluence of Industries\n\nAustin\u2019s startup ecosystem is characterized by its versatility. While the tech industry is at the forefront, the city boasts a diverse array of sectors, including healthcare, finance, and education. This blend allows startups to explore various niches and collaborate across industries.\n\nFor instance, companies like CrowdSource focus on AI and data analytics, while startups like Sana Health are redefining healthcare solutions. This diversity leads to a dynamic environment where entrepreneurs can leverage cross-industry insights to drive innovation.\n\nMoreover, the presence of established tech giants, such as Dell and IBM, contributes to a rich ecosystem. These companies often collaborate with startups, providing them with mentorship and access to resources, which further enhances the startup landscape.\n\nThe Role of Government and Policy Support\n\nGovernment support plays a significant role in fostering Austin\u2019s startup culture. Local policies often favor entrepreneurship, with initiatives designed to reduce regulatory burdens and encourage innovation. Programs aimed at supporting small businesses create a conducive environment for startups to flourish.\n\nFurthermore, the Texas state government has taken steps to promote economic growth. With no personal income tax, Texas attracts entrepreneurs looking to maximize their profits. This favorable tax environment has contributed to the migration of businesses from high-tax states to Texas, including Austin.\n\nNetworking Events: Building Connections\n\nAustin\u2019s calendar is filled with networking events that cater to entrepreneurs. Meetups, pitch nights, and hackathons offer opportunities for startups to showcase their ideas and connect with potential investors.\n\nEvents like Austin Startup Week and Startup Grind bring together founders, investors, and industry experts. These gatherings foster collaboration, allowing entrepreneurs to gain insights and forge relationships that can lead to future partnerships.\n\nChallenges in the Startup Terrain\n\nWhile Austin boasts a thriving startup culture, it is not without its challenges. The rapid growth of the tech scene has led to increased competition for talent and funding. Startups must continuously innovate to stay ahead in this dynamic environment.\n\nMoreover, the cost of living in Austin has risen, making it challenging for some startups to attract talent without offering competitive salaries. As a result, companies must find creative ways to foster a positive work culture and retain their employees.\n\nFuture Prospects: Sustainability and Growth\n\nLooking ahead, Austin\u2019s startup culture is poised for continued growth. As more entrepreneurs flock to the city, the ecosystem will become increasingly diverse and innovative.\n\nHowever, sustainability will be a critical focus. As the city grows, maintaining the collaborative spirit and sense of community that define Austin\u2019s startup culture will be essential. Initiatives aimed at preserving affordable housing and supporting local businesses will play a crucial role in shaping the future of Austin\u2019s startup landscape.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe unique startup culture in Austin is a product of its creative vibe, supportive community, access to funding, diverse talent pool, and commitment to inclusion. As the city continues to change, its startup ecosystem will remain a vibrant force in the national and global tech terrain. With its blend of innovation, collaboration, and diversity, Austin stands out as a prime destination for entrepreneurs seeking to launch their startups. As more visionaries settle in this thriving city, the future of Austin\u2019s startup culture looks promising, ensuring that it remains a key player in the ever-evolving tech terrain."

        "source": "Digital Trends",
        "article_content": "HP is in the process of redoing its product lines, with the OmniBook lineup taking over all of its consumer machines including budget, midrange, premium, and gaming laptops. The EliteBook remains as its business laptop line, and the new EliteBook X G1a is the latest machine that leverages AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI series of chipsets in the \u201cNext Gen AI PC\u201d initiative.\n\nThe EliteBook X G1a introduces several new features aimed at those tasks that businesspeople want the most, and I received a preproduction unit to take a look at. I can\u2019t provide benchmarks or test some of the more advanced features that aren\u2019t available yet. But the EliteBook X G1a is a tantalizing vision.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDesign\n\nHP makes some good-looking and high-quality laptops. The EliteBook X G1a is a prime example. It\u2019s solid as a rock all around, with no bending, flexing, or twisting in the lid, keyboard deck, or chassis. And it all seems crafted from chunks of aluminum in a way that\u2019s reminiscent of of Apple\u2019s MacBooks. The silver color scheme is elegant and refined, with a chrome HP logo that stands out without being mere bling.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nThe hinge is smooth when opening the lid with one hand, and it stays firmly in place. It might be a pre-production unit, but it doesn\u2019t need much adjusting. I like the look and feel quite a bit, and I\u2019m sure HP\u2019s business market will agree.\n\nI don\u2019t have full specs for the laptop. But, it\u2019s not the thinnest or lightest 14-inch laptop. In fact, it\u2019s a little chunky compared to something like the incredibly thin MacBook Air M3 that\u2019s closer to a 14-inch than a 13-inch laptop. I don\u2019t mind it, but it\u2019s not going to lead its class. The display bezels are small enough to keep its width and depth in check, but the Dell XPS 14 remains the best in that department.\n\nI also liked the slightly rounded edges on the palm rest. That made it comfortable for longer typing sessions, like writing up this first look. Overall, I found the same kind of fastidious design that I\u2019ve always perceived in Apple products.\n\nKeyboard and touchpad\n\nHP also makes good keyboards. Its Spectre keyboards have always been among my favorites on Windows laptops, coming very close to my overall favorite, Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard. And they put a great keyboard in the EliteBook X G1a.\n\nFirst, the keycap size and key spacing is perfect, and HP put high-contrast lettering that stands out against the dark gray keys. That makes the lettering easier to see even without the backlighting turned on, and it\u2019s an accessibility feature for those with poor vision. Then, the switches are deep enough at 1.5mm, and they\u2019re precise and snappy. They\u2019re also consistent across the entire keyboard, including the space bar that can be too loose on some keyboards.\n\nThe touchpad is mechanical, which is a bit of a disappointment. Haptic touchpads are becoming more common on premium laptops, and HP has a great one on the Spectre x360 14. I wish it were available here. The touchpad is plenty large and its buttons have quiet, confident clicks. So it\u2019s a good mechanical touchpad.\n\nThe display is touch-enabled, which I like. Overall, input options are excellent even if I wish the touchpad were a haptic version.\n\nConnectivity and webcam\n\nThe EliteBook X G1a has plenty of connectivity, with a couple of Thunderbolt 4 ports, USB-C and USB-A, and an HDMI port. Again, I don\u2019t know all the specs, including wireless connectivity, but I have no doubt it\u2019s up-to-date and that cellular connectivity will be an option. Note that the inclusion of Thunderbolt 4 is a little surprising given the AMD chipset. That\u2019s usually not a thing.\n\nThe webcam is a 5MP version, but it\u2019s not just a high-res webcam. It includes on-chip AI processing that enables enhanced user presence detection that, for example, blurs the screen automatically when two people are in view. There\u2019s also the usual AI-enhanced functionality we expect with Microsoft\u2019s various Copilot+ features, and Poly Camera Pro that further enhances video quality and performance using the neural processing unit (NPU).\n\nPerformance\n\nHP uses a custom version of AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 9, specifically the R9-12c PRO that\u2019s based on the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 PRO. It enables the kind of security and manageability that enterprises demand, along with the sheer power of the Ryzen AI 9 chipset. I don\u2019t have details on the chipset and I can\u2019t publish any benchmarks.\n\nThe custom aspect is that the HP-specific chipset has faster on-device AI thanks to an NPU that runs at up to 55 tera operations per second (TOPS). That\u2019s faster than any other chipset available today, and that means faster AI processing with the efficiency of the NPU compared to using the GPU.\n\nThere\u2019s also custom RAM that runs at up to 8,000 MT/s, faster than you\u2019ll see from other AMD chipsets. That, too, helps speed up AI processing. And HP will be introducing its AI Companion software that will enable a variety of AI features above and beyond what Copilot+ provides. AI Companion includes Analyze that lets you dig into files, along with other features that have yet to be fully explained. All of the features will run on-device, though, keeping things theoretically safer and more private and using the NPU to maintain efficiency.\n\nHP also updated its SmartSense feature to use AI to better manage performance and fan speed. Now, there are just two options available \u2014 SmartSense and Best Performance \u2014 meaning that users won\u2019t need to spend as much time managing the EliteBook X G1a\u2019s performance, heat, and noise. We\u2019ll have to wait until we can run benchmarks to determine how effective the new software is in managing things.\n\nFinally, as a member of HP\u2019s business lineup, the EliteBook X G1a has Wolf Security for enhanced security and privacy.\n\nBattery life\n\nThe battery here is reasonably hefty at 74.5 watt-hours. That should be plenty to power the laptop for a reasonably long time regardless of the display choice. But, once again, it\u2019s not something I can test and report on.\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 9 chipset hasn\u2019t been as efficient as some others, though, such as Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake that we saw in the Asus Zenbook S 14.\n\nDisplay and audio\n\nThere will be two display options with the EliteBook X G1a. There\u2019s a 14.0-inch WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS panel and a 2.8K (2880 x 1800) OLED touch display. The latter runs at up to 120Hz, and it\u2019s the one on my pre-production unit.\n\nI can\u2019t test the display, but it seems to offer the same bright, dynamic colors and inky blacks that I expect out of a typical OLED display. The IPS panel will offer better battery life but much worse image quality.\n\nAudio is provided by a four-speaker setup \u2014 two downward-firing and two upward-firing. Dual microphones use AI Noise Reduction to improve quality.\n\nAn intriguing laptop for business users\n\nAt this point, the most I can say about the EliteBook X G1a is that it\u2019s an incredibly intriguing laptop with a host of features and functionality that could make for an elite (no pun intended) laptop for business users. It\u2019s drop-dead gorgeous and solidly built, even for a pre-production machine. And it promises great performance and AI integration.\n\nOf course, the devil will be in the details, including pricing, and those will have to wait until it\u2019s formally introduced. In the meantime, businesses should be looking into the EliteBook X G1a for its 2025 procurements."
