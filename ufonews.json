While the popular app already serves its intended purpose, Meta is exploring new ways to modernize it. According to a recent WhatsApp beta build for Android, Meta AI character creation could soon be coming to the mobile app.\n\nPer a WABetaInfo report, Meta is preparing to bring AI character creation to WhatsApp. Version 2.25.1.26 beta for Android reveals how the feature could work if the company proceeds with its plans. Similar to the existing Meta AI Studio tool on Instagram\u2019s website, WhatsApp will seemingly let users build custom AI chatbots by describing their personality, expertise, unique qualities, etc.\n\nTo inspire users creating Meta AI characters, WhatsApp may display trait suggestions when building a chatbot. Based on the included screenshot, there also appears to be a refresh button that will generate new recommendations if users are unhappy with the presented ones.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the AI characters themselves aren\u2019t new; eligible WhatsApp users can already access first- and third-party chatbots in the app. The upcoming addition will only popularize creating them by making the building tools easily accessible.\n\nOtherwise, WABetaInfo highlights that WhatsApp for Android may soon drop the Communities tab in favor of a new one dedicated to AI chats. Those who rely on the Communities feature will still be able to access it through the main Chats tab. It remains unclear when and if Meta will roll out these changes, as they\u2019re still in development.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us! Email our staff at Email our staff at news@androidauthority.com .

            "article_content": "Content provided by British Council\n\nRead the following text, and answer questions 1-9 below\n\n[1] Do you believe in ghosts or paranormal activity? Professor Chris French is keen to know why. His research focus is \u201canomalistic psychology\u201d: bizarre experiences that many people have and why they believe in events that do not have a scientific base.\n\n[2] French, a professor emeritus at Goldsmiths College at the University of London in the United Kingdom, explores examples of \u201csupernatural activity\u201d in his research, and in his book The Science of Weird S**t: Why Our Minds Conjure the Paranormal. He investigates ghost sightings, fortune-tellers, clairvoyants and psychics. Alien abductions are also in his scope. If it is a strange thing, French is interested.\n\n[3] Ghost sightings take up most of his time. There are many reasons people think they have seen one. One is a well-proven phenomenon called sleep paralysis, little known outside scientific circles. It can convince even cynics that they are in the presence of a \u2013 usually malicious \u2013 ghost.\n\n[4] \u201cSleep paralysis is a temporary period of paralysis between sleep and wakefulness,\u201d French said. \u201cIt can come with a range of additional symptoms that can make it absolutely terrifying. These include a strong sense of an evil presence and hallucinations like hearing voices or footsteps and seeing demons. Other symptoms include experiencing difficulty in breathing, feeling pressure on the chest and intense fear.\u201d\n\n[5] People go through several different stages during a regular night\u2019s sleep. One is REM, or rapid eye movement, sleep \u2013 the stage associated with vivid dreams. \u201cThe muscles of the body are actually paralysed during this phase, presumably to stop us from acting out the actions of the dream,\u201d French said.\n\n[6] Sometimes, REM sleep dream imagery gets mixed up with feelings of being awake, and we mistakenly believe we are having a supernatural experience. \u201cIt\u2019s a glitch in the normal sleep cycle. It\u2019s as though the brain wakes up, but the body doesn\u2019t \u2013 and all of that imagery spills over into waking consciousness,\u201d said French. Many artistic representations of ghosts and demons from the past probably stem from sleep paralysis, he added.\n\n[7] How about Ouija boards? This apparent way to communicate with the dead involves asking questions and having a form of marker seemingly move across a board of letters and numbers to spell out answers on its own. \u201cWhen people experience the planchette or an upturned wine glass moving around during a Ouija board session, the illusion that some external force is causing the movement is powerful,\u201d French explained. \u201cIn fact, those taking part are making unconscious muscular movements, known as the ideomotor effect.\u201d\n\n[8] Sometimes, ghost stories are cons to make a dollar. But while scammers do exist, our desire to believe is the bigger culprit. \u201cThe single most powerful cognitive bias that we all suffer from is confirmation bias,\u201d said French. \u201cWe pay more attention to evidence that is consistent with what we already believe or would like to be true. And we either ignore evidence [that does not match what we believe] or make up reasons it can be dismissed.\u201d If you believe in ghosts, it is more likely you will think you see one, he said.\n\nSource: South China Moring Post, December 29\n\nQuestions\n\n1. Which of the following best describes \u201canomalistic psychology\u201d, according to paragraph 1?\n\nA. The study of abnormal human behaviour.\n\nB. The scientific investigation of supernatural powers.\n\nC. A branch of psychology dealing with mental disorders.\n\nD. none of the above\n\n2. In paragraph 2, what is the one thing that connects all the subjects that Professor French studies?\n\n3. Based on paragraph 3, what does the public know about or think of sleep paralysis?\n\n4. Paragraph 4 describes \u2026\n\nA. different techniques used to identify sleep paralysis.\n\nB. the unsettling aspects of sleep paralysis, including the accompanying sensations and hallucinations.\n\nC. how experiences with sleep paralysis can influence cultural interpretations of dreams.\n\nD. how sleep paralysis research has evolved and the various treatments for individuals affected by the condition.\n\n5.

            "article_content": "The 2000s brought groundbreaking innovations to horror cinema that continue influencing filmmakers today. From found-footage techniques that changed how we experience fear to intimate character studies that elevated the genre\u2019s storytelling potential, this era delivered unforgettable scares that resonated with audiences worldwide. Furthermore, independent productions proved horror could tackle complex themes while maintaining commercial appeal, while major studios took chances on unique creative voices that would reshape the genre landscape.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nThrough careful character development, innovative directing techniques, and genuine emotional stakes, the best horror films of the 2000s demonstrate how genre pictures can tackle complex themes while still delivering the scares audiences crave. Here\u2019s our picks for the best horror movies of the 2000s.\n\nDrag Me to Hell (2009)\n\nPlay video\n\nSam Raimi\u2019s return to horror follows Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), a loan officer cursed to be dragged to hell in three days after denying a mortgage extension to an elderly woman. The film perfectly balances genuine scares with gleefully twisted comedy, powered by Raimi\u2019s masterful direction that transforms this tale of karmic revenge into a rollercoaster ride. Through dynamic camera movements, memorable practical effects, and a deep understanding of how to build tension, Drag Me to Hell creates a uniquely engaging horror experience that demonstrates why Raimi remains one of the genre\u2019s most influential voices.\n\nCloverfield (2008)\n\nPlay video\n\nDirector Matt Reeves and producer J.J. Abrams revolutionized the monster movie genre with this found-footage masterpiece that follows a group of friends documenting their desperate attempt to survive a massive creature attack on New York City. By grounding its spectacular destruction through intimate, documentary-style filmmaking, Cloverfield creates an immersive experience that makes its fantastic elements feel terrifyingly real. The film\u2019s focus on ordinary people caught in extraordinary circumstances and masterful special effects that never break the found-footage illusion create a haunting portrait of survival against impossible odds that still\n\nThe Ring (2002)\n\nPlay video\n\nGore Verbinski\u2019s atmospheric horror masterpiece follows journalist Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) as she investigates a mysterious videotape that kills viewers seven days after watching it. The film\u2019s strength lies in its ability to create overwhelming dread through subtle visual cues and psychological manipulation rather than relying on jump scares. Through its exploration of urban legends and technology-based fears, alongside Watts\u2019 compelling performance as a mother fighting to save her son, The Ring crafts a profoundly unsettling story that transforms mundane objects like televisions and telephones into sources of terror. Plus, The Ring is one of the best horror remakes, capable of standing on its own legs while showing respect for the original Japanese flick.\n\nMartyrs (2008)\n\nPlay video\n\nPascal Laugier\u2019s uncompromising film follows Lucie (Myl\u00e8ne Jampano\u00ef), who escapes from brutal captivity as a child only to be haunted by visions of her tormentors years later. When she finally tracks down those responsible, her closest friend Anna (Morjana Alaoui) becomes entangled in a secret society\u2019s disturbing quest for spiritual enlightenment through suffering. Through its unflinching portrayal of trauma and sophisticated exploration of martyrdom, Martyrs transcends typical revenge narratives to deliver a philosophically rich horror experience that challenges viewers to keep their eyes open while maintaining powerful emotional resonance.\n\nThe Others (2001)\n\nPlay video\n\nAlejandro Amen\u00e1bar\u2019s gothic experience stars Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart, a devoutly religious mother struggling to protect her photosensitive children Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) in a fog-shrouded Victorian mansion. When three mysterious servants arrive, led by the enigmatic Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), a series of inexplicable events forces Grace to question everything she believes about life, death, and reality itself. Through its masterful use of atmosphere and psychological manipulation, The Others transforms familiar haunted house tropes into a profound exploration of grief, faith, and maternal devotion. The film\u2019s true genius lies in how it uses its period setting and gothic elements to craft the ultimate ghost story.\n\nShaun of the Dead (2004)\n\nPlay video\n\nEdgar Wright\u2019s brilliant horror-comedy follows Shaun (Simon Pegg), a directionless electronics salesman stuck in a dead-end job and a failing relationship with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). When London falls to a zombie outbreak, Shaun must finally step up, joining forces with his slacker best friend Ed (Nick Frost) to rescue his mother (Penelope Wilton) and win back Liz. Wright\u2019s signature rapid-fire visual style and razor-sharp script, co-written with Pegg, elevate this beyond simple parody. Instead, the zombie apocalypse becomes a perfect backdrop for exploring very human themes about growing up, accepting responsibility, and maintaining relationships.\n\nLet the Right One In (2008)\n\nPlay video\n\nTomas Alfredson\u2019s Swedish masterpiece introduces us to Oskar (K\u00e5re Hedebrant), a bullied 12-year-old boy who forms a profound connection with Eli (Lina Leandersson), a mysterious girl who only appears at night in their snow-covered Stockholm suburb. As their relationship deepens, Oskar\u2019s discovery of Eli\u2019s vampire nature transforms this intimate character study into something far more complex. Against a stark winter landscape, Alfredson crafts a tender coming-of-age story that reimagines vampire mythology through the lens of childhood loneliness.\n\nParanormal Activity (2007)\n\nPlay video\n\nDirected by Oren Peli, this found-footage phenomenon centers on Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat), a young couple whose attempt to document strange occurrences in their suburban San Diego home spirals into a nightmare. As Micah\u2019s obsession with capturing evidence intensifies, the supernatural presence grows more aggressive, revealing a sinister decades-old connection to Katie. Armed with nothing but security cameras and practical effects, Peli manipulates negative space and sound design to create overwhelming dread. Yet beneath the supernatural scares lies an equally disturbing portrait of a relationship crumbling under the weight of fear, making its explosive climax all the more devastating.\n\n28 Days Later (2002)\n\nPlay video\n\nDanny Boyle reimagines zombie cinema by opening with Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakening from a coma to discover London abandoned. Alongside fellow survivors Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley), he uncovers the horrifying reality: a \u201crage\u201d virus has transformed most of the population into rabid killing machines. Shot on early digital video cameras that lend a raw documentary feel, Boyle\u2019s apocalyptic vision stands apart in its exploration of human nature. The real horror emerges not from the infected masses but from the survivors themselves, as the distinction between civilization and savagery blurs in the fight for survival. The movie also redefined the zombie mythology by turning the undead into agile killing machines instead of their classic slow interpretation.\n\nThe Descent (2005)\n\nPlay video\n\nNeil Marshall\u2019s horror movie is one of the best 2000s horror movies, and there are no questions about it. The Descent follows Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), who joins five friends for a spelunking expedition one year after losing her husband and daughter. Under the leadership of the ambitious Juno (Natalie Mendoza), what begins as adventure becomes a desperate fight for survival when the group finds itself trapped in an unmapped cave system. Marshall builds unbearable tension long before revealing the ancient predators lurking in the darkness, as the cave\u2019s suffocating environment brings long-buried resentments and betrayals to the surface. This sophisticated approach to horror transforms a monster movie into a multifaceted study of trauma and survival, with an all-female cast facing both physical and psychological terrors that will haunt viewers long after the credits roll."

            "article_content": "Quick, what do you think of when you hear the word \u201cThunderbird?\u201d\n\nThe (very snazzy) car? The plane? Or perhaps even the email software?\n\nBut how many of you would conjure up images of a gigantic creature that flaps its wings and unleashes tempests? And how many more of you are privy to rumors of sightings of such a creature coming out of Pennsylvania?\n\nA Kiowa shield cover decorated with a turtle, a Thunderbird, stars and the milky way. Sightings of the Thunderbird have been reported in Pennsylvania as recently as 2021. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images)Universal Images Group via Getty\n\nAccording to \u201cEncyclopedia of Beasts and Monsters in Myth, Legend and Folklore (2016),\u201d Thunderbirds are gigantic spirits from Native American lore that take the form of birds. They\u2019re particularly known for controlling the weather.\n\n\u201cBy [the Thunderbird\u2019s] work, the earth was watered and vegetation grew,\u201d reads Encyclopedia Britannica. \u201cLightning was believed to flash from its beak, and the beating of its wings was thought to represent the rolling of thunder.\u201d\n\nTales vary depending on which tribe tells the story, adds \u201cNative American Myths: Stories & Folklore from the Apache to the Zuni (2018)\u201d: Some believe it\u2019s a god. Others describe it as being more human in shape. The Lakota Sioux even had more than one type of Thunderbird.\n\nNow, it could be argued the Thunderbird myth is among those that can be easily explained: North America is full of incredibly large birds that \u2014 back in the day \u2014 could have been mistaken for some godlike creature. California condors \u2014 North America\u2019s largest wild bird \u2014 has a wingspan of 109 inches, or a little over 9 feet, far exceeding the height of your average Joe.\n\nThat would make it unlikely for anyone to believe they saw a Thunderbird in this day and age, right?\n\nWell.\n\nPeople do, in fact, still claim to see Thunderbirds, vast zoological knowledge out there and all. According to a 2018 Juneau Empire report, a woman proclaimed on Facebook how she spotted a \u201cHUGE\u201d bird \u201calmost the size of a small airplane\u201d in Mendenhall Valley, Alaska. Reddit threads detailing accounts from all over the country \u2014 mainly in the West \u2014 eagerly discuss the potential existence of the being.\n\nAnd, of course, there have been plenty of purported sightings in the Keystone State.\n\nKwakiutl dancers in masks and costumes representing (left to right) Wasp, Thunderbird, and Grizzly-bear, arrive in canoes during the winter ceremony. The myth of the Thunderbird differs from tribe to tribe. (Photo by Buyenlarge/Getty Images)Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Wilds website, sightings of the Thunderbird have popped up in places such as Pine Creek Valley and the I-80 Frontier over the last 100 years or so: A man in Cameron County claimed to have seen a flock of them in 1892. An early pioneer of Potter County swore he saw the same.\n\nThere\u2019s even a legend known as the \u201cLost Thunderbird Photo,\u201d which is said to be evidence of the creature, although it was supposedly lost in a house fire. Researcher Ivan Sanderson \u2014 who states he was the one to have left the photo with the owner of the house that burnt down \u2014 has dedicated a whole website to this lost photo, as well as other paranormal encounters from Bigfoot to the Jersey Devil.\n\n\u201cThis was like a mammoth hawk, or a mammoth eagle or a mammoth raptor of some kind,\u201d describes one witness to an alleged sighting in 1970. \u201cIt was not a condor. It had no resemblance to any prehistoric animal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was an aberration. There are creatures that, for whatever reason, they grow bigger than the average bear.\u201d\n\nThunderbirds have continued to be spotted in Pennsylvania in recent years: Head over to cryptid and alien tracking sites like the one run by Pennsylvania-based researcher Stan Gordon and you\u2019ll find accounts of run-ins with Thunderbirds that have occurred way passed the 1970s.\n\nA Thunderbird as drawn by a Dakota near Fort Snelling, Minnesota, around 1883. (Smithsonian Institution via Wikimedia Commons)Smithsonian Institution via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\u201cIn early April of 2021, [a] woman was just pulling into a parking lot for a scheduled appointment at a location in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,\u201d one such account reads. \u201cShe was a few minutes early, so she was talking with a friend on her cellphone.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, something flew over her vehicle that shadowed the entire car. Even though she was in her car she ducked her head, thinking it was a small plane about to crash. She commented to her friend about what had just happened. Seconds later, she saw the biggest bird she had ever seen flying in front of her car.\u201d\n\nNow, the biggest question is, if these birds are so big, why aren\u2019t more people seeing them?\n\nWell, if you adopt the same line of thinking that some other paranormal researchers apply to other cryptids such as Bigfoot\u2014 as highlighted in \u201cThe Sasquatch People and Their Interdimensional Connection (2011)\u201d \u2014 the Thunderbird can be viewed as a creature that moves among dimensions. In other words, one minute it\u2019s in our dimension where we can spot it, and then, boom, it zips into the unseeable unknown.\n\nSo, are all these sightings just really, really big birds, or creatures from beyond our realm of understanding? You decide.\n\nAnd next time you\u2019re caught in a storm, be sure to take a closer look at the sky."

As the terrible effects of climate change become more obvious to people around the world, it is important for the public to also know there is hope. Science, as always, offers solutions to many of our main challenges.\u201d\n\nNajat Mokhtar, Head of IAEA Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications, agreed: \u201cI am delighted to see ours labs' the vital research being shared on the respected Discovery Channel. Science is a vital force for good in the world, and nuclear science offers so many incredible innovations to help countries meet their development goals.\u201d\n\nJamie Cooke, Executive Vice President and Managing Director Central Europe, Middle East and Turkey said: \u201cWe are thrilled that our viewers will now get the opportunity to learn more about how nuclear science is being used in innovative ways to improve our lives and advance the environmental sustainability agenda. We consider it our duty to leverage the voice, storytelling strength and expertise we have, to cast light and tell the right stories that will positively impact our communities and viewers. It\u2019s part of our Social Good Strategy, and we want to use our media for good.\u201d\n\nAbout the International Atomic Energy Agency\n\nWidely known as the world\u2019s \u201cAtoms for Peace and Development\u201d organization within the United Nations family, the IAEA is the international centre for cooperation in the nuclear field.

            "article_content": "Even for an industry that depends on relentless innovation to thrive, life sciences have seen remarkable advancements in recent decades. From the Human Genome Project paving the way for precision medicine, to monoclonal antibodies, mRNA, CRISPR gene editing, and other major breakthroughs \u2013 our industry continuously proves its ability to serve humanity by consistently one-upping itself.\n\nAnd yet, data science is now poised to usher in a level and acceleration of progress that even life sciences have never before seen.\n\nWhy AI Is now hitting its full stride\n\nAlthough data science and AI have been applied in life sciences for decades, their application has often fallen short of expectations, yielding incremental, rather than transformative, gains. But today\u2019s advances in algorithm sophistication, large-scale data integration, and cloud computing have helped them overcome the fragmented data, slower processing, and other limitations that have been stunting their full power. Regulatory agencies, meanwhile, are providing clearer guidance on the use of models, giving organisations the guardrails needed to innovate faster, with confidence.\n\nTogether, these developments, combined with the global urgency to address humanity\u2019s most pressing health challenges, create a perfect storm for data science and AI to take life sciences to new heights.\n\nWhat makes AI so transformative\n\nWith its ability to process massive and complex datasets, identify hidden patterns, and continuously evolve as it learns from new data, AI brings a depth of understanding and speed of decision-making and discovery that takes it to a level far beyond human capabilities. With predictive modelling, AI doesn\u2019t just analyse existing data it anticipates future outcomes. This allows researchers to solve problems at scale with unprecedented precision and efficiency, significantly reducing the time and cost of bringing new therapies to market.\n\nAI is at a critical juncture, and 2025 promises to be a transformative year. Here\u2019s how I believe models will reshape life sciences in the year ahead:\n\nAI graduates from trials to tangible real-world solutions\n\nThe integration of data science in drug discovery is evolving beyond mere trial phases to practical uses \u2013 especially in the creation and testing of molecular compounds in silico. With algorithms getting better at simulating biological interaction, we can significantly accelerate the process of drug discovery. Not only will this improve initial testing efficiency, it will open doors to novel therapies that revolutionise the pharmaceutical industry and, more importantly, profoundly impact world health.\n\nData science will take diagnostic accuracy to new heights\n\nMachine learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable proficiency over the past year in detecting irregularities in medical images, often exceeding the level of accuracy seasoned professionals can provide. In the year 2025, AI-powered imaging tools will greatly enhance diagnostic precision in radiology and pathology, enabling healthcare providers to deliver more precise determinations. Machine learning-assisted medical imaging of tumours, for instance, will dramatically improve their pairing with the right targeted treatments. Such advancements will play a crucial role in allowing patients to live longer and higher quality lives.\n\nLLMs will transform documentation\n\nFrom scientific manuscripts to clinical trial records and regulatory filings, large language models (LLM) will revolutionise documentation. LLMs are already proving effective in managing specialised medical language, compliance checks, and simplifying complex terms, with providers like IBM and Microsoft integrating them into healthcare documentation. Organisations are also increasingly turning to automation for authorship of Clinical Study Reports using data from clinical systems and statistical computing environments to streamline processes and enhance efficiency. This change will speed up the process of finding new cures and lead to better results for patients, while also boosting the pace and accuracy of advancements.\n\nData science will accelerate clinical trial recruiting\n\nOver the next 12 months, AI will streamline the recruitment process for trials by utilising electronic health records and real-time patient data. This will enable more precise and faster identification of suitable candidates for more successful trials. We are already seeing signs of this transformation with AI-powered platforms significantly reducing recruitment timelines by more accurately matching patients to trial criteria. Such improvements will enhance trial effectiveness and accelerate the pace of medical innovation.\n\nAI compliance platforms will see wide adoption\n\n2025 will see the rise of AI-powered compliance platforms that provide for the real-time monitoring of regulatory adherence across clinical trials, drug manufacturing, and elsewhere. As regulatory requirements grow increasingly complex, such AI solutions will be extremely helpful in managing compliance data in real-time, allowing organisations to maintain operational integrity.\n\n2025 will mark a turning point for data science and AI in life sciences, redefining what\u2019s achievable across the industry. From revolutionising drug discovery and diagnostics to streamlining documentation and compliance, models are accelerating the pace of innovation and enabling breakthroughs that were once unimaginable.\n\nWhile the opportunities are immense, challenges remain. Ethical considerations, data privacy concerns, and navigating complex regulatory frameworks will require careful attention to ensure AI\u2019s potential is realised responsibly. But data science will undoubtedly prove itself as a transformative force reshaping the way we develop therapies, conduct trials, and deliver care. As the industry continues to embrace these capabilities, 2025 is destined to be the year where life sciences once again pushes the boundaries of innovation \u2013 enhancing lives and advancing healthcare on a global scale."

            "article_content": "OpenAI launched the A.I. boom in late 2022 with the release of the online chatbot ChatGPT. The company continues to lead the field but faces countless competitors. One of its biggest rivals, xAI, is led by Elon Musk, who has developed a close relationship with Mr. Trump.\n\nMany A.I. companies and independent experts believe that technologies like ChatGPT can increase economic growth by accelerating work and research in areas as far-flung as computer programming, medicine, education and finance. But continued development of these technologies requires enormous amounts of raw computing power and electricity.\n\nOpenAI and its rivals are racing to expand the pool of giant computer data centers needed to build and operate their A.I. systems, which will require hundreds of billions of dollars in new investment. With its new economic blueprint, OpenAI hopes to encourage government policies that can facilitate that additional infrastructure.\n\nMost notably, the company has called on policymakers to allow significant investment in American A.I. projects by investors in the Middle East, though the Biden administration has been wary of such investment. OpenAI argues that if countries like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia do not invest in U.S. infrastructure, their money will flow to China instead.\n\n\u201cAre those countries going to be building on U.S. rails or are they going to be building on C.C.P. rails?\u201d Mr. Lehane said in an interview, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. He described nations like the Emirates and Saudi Arabia not as allies but more as \u201cswing states\u201d that will choose the United States or China for A.I. investments."

            "article_content": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala., January 12, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"MPT\") (NYSE: MPW) today issued the below statement in response to Prospect Medical Group\u2019s (\"Prospect\") decision to commence an in-court restructuring process under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nAs discussed during MPT\u2019s third quarter 2024 earnings, while Prospect\u2019s California facilities have reported volume growth and improved coverage trends in 2024, its overall liquidity has been adversely impacted by stalled sales processes across various East Coast markets, including Rhode Island where MPT has no interest in the real estate. Prospect has not paid any rent to MPT since June 2024, its Connecticut and Pennsylvania lessees and mortgagors have made only minimal payments over the past two years, and MPT has been recognizing all revenues from Prospect using cash basis accounting since 2023.\n\nThe Company\u2019s priority during the restructuring process is to protect MPT\u2019s investment in Prospect\u2019s California hospitals. MPT also expects to support efforts by Prospect to use the Chapter 11 process to complete a successful sale of Prospect\u2019s Connecticut facilities.\n\nAbout Medical Properties Trust, Inc.\n\nMedical Properties Trust, Inc. is a self-advised real estate investment trust formed in 2003 to acquire and develop net-leased hospital facilities. From its inception in Birmingham, Alabama, the Company has grown to become one of the world\u2019s largest owners of hospital real estate with 402 facilities and approximately 40,000 licensed beds in nine countries and across three continents as of September 30, 2024. MPT\u2019s financing model facilitates acquisitions and recapitalizations and allows operators of hospitals to unlock the value of their real estate assets to fund facility improvements, technology upgrades and other investments in operations. For more information, please visit the Company\u2019s website at www.medicalpropertiestrust.com.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as \"may\", \"will\", \"would\", \"could\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"estimate\", \"target\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"guidance\" or other similar words, and include statements regarding our strategies, objectives, asset sales and other liquidity transactions (including the use of proceeds thereof), expected re-tenanting of vacant facilities and any related regulatory approvals, and expected outcomes from Prospect\u2019s Chapter 11 restructuring process. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or future events to differ materially from those expressed in or underlying such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to: (i) the risk that the outcome and terms of the bankruptcy restructuring of Prospect will not be consistent with those anticipated by the Company; (ii) the risk that previously announced or contemplated property sales, loan repayments, and other capital recycling transactions do not occur as anticipated or at all; (iii) the risk that MPT is not able to attain its leverage, liquidity and cost of capital objectives within a reasonable time period or at all; (iv) MPT\u2019s ability to obtain debt financing on attractive terms or at all, as a result of changes in interest rates and other factors, which may adversely impact its ability to pay down, refinance, restructure or extend its indebtedness as it becomes due, or pursue acquisition and development opportunities; (v) the ability of our tenants, operators and borrowers to satisfy their obligations under their respective contractual arrangements with us; (vi) the ability of our tenants and operators to operate profitably and generate positive cash flow, remain solvent, comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations in the operation of our properties, to deliver high-quality services, to attract and retain qualified personnel and to attract patients; (vii) the risk that we are unable to monetize our investments in certain tenants at full value within a reasonable time period or at all, (viii) our success in implementing our business strategy and our ability to identify, underwrite, finance, consummate and integrate acquisitions and investments; and (ix) the risks and uncertainties of litigation or other regulatory proceedings.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Even for an industry that depends on relentless innovation to thrive, life sciences have seen remarkable advancements in recent decades. From the Human Genome Project paving the way for precision medicine, to monoclonal antibodies, mRNA, CRISPR gene editing, and other major breakthroughs \u2013 our industry continuously proves its ability to serve humanity by consistently one-upping itself.\n\nAnd yet, data science is now poised to usher in a level and acceleration of progress that even life sciences have never before seen.\n\nWhy AI Is now hitting its full stride\n\nAlthough data science and AI have been applied in life sciences for decades, their application has often fallen short of expectations, yielding incremental, rather than transformative, gains. But today\u2019s advances in algorithm sophistication, large-scale data integration, and cloud computing have helped them overcome the fragmented data, slower processing, and other limitations that have been stunting their full power. Regulatory agencies, meanwhile, are providing clearer guidance on the use of models, giving organisations the guardrails needed to innovate faster, with confidence.\n\nTogether, these developments, combined with the global urgency to address humanity\u2019s most pressing health challenges, create a perfect storm for data science and AI to take life sciences to new heights.\n\nWhat makes AI so transformative\n\nWith its ability to process massive and complex datasets, identify hidden patterns, and continuously evolve as it learns from new data, AI brings a depth of understanding and speed of decision-making and discovery that takes it to a level far beyond human capabilities. With predictive modelling, AI doesn\u2019t just analyse existing data it anticipates future outcomes. This allows researchers to solve problems at scale with unprecedented precision and efficiency, significantly reducing the time and cost of bringing new therapies to market.\n\nAI is at a critical juncture, and 2025 promises to be a transformative year. Here\u2019s how I believe models will reshape life sciences in the year ahead:\n\nAI graduates from trials to tangible real-world solutions\n\nThe integration of data science in drug discovery is evolving beyond mere trial phases to practical uses \u2013 especially in the creation and testing of molecular compounds in silico. With algorithms getting better at simulating biological interaction, we can significantly accelerate the process of drug discovery. Not only will this improve initial testing efficiency, it will open doors to novel therapies that revolutionise the pharmaceutical industry and, more importantly, profoundly impact world health.\n\nData science will take diagnostic accuracy to new heights\n\nMachine learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable proficiency over the past year in detecting irregularities in medical images, often exceeding the level of accuracy seasoned professionals can provide. In the year 2025, AI-powered imaging tools will greatly enhance diagnostic precision in radiology and pathology, enabling healthcare providers to deliver more precise determinations. Machine learning-assisted medical imaging of tumours, for instance, will dramatically improve their pairing with the right targeted treatments. Such advancements will play a crucial role in allowing patients to live longer and higher quality lives.\n\nLLMs will transform documentation\n\nFrom scientific manuscripts to clinical trial records and regulatory filings, large language models (LLM) will revolutionise documentation. LLMs are already proving effective in managing specialised medical language, compliance checks, and simplifying complex terms, with providers like IBM and Microsoft integrating them into healthcare documentation. Organisations are also increasingly turning to automation for authorship of Clinical Study Reports using data from clinical systems and statistical computing environments to streamline processes and enhance efficiency. This change will speed up the process of finding new cures and lead to better results for patients, while also boosting the pace and accuracy of advancements.\n\nData science will accelerate clinical trial recruiting\n\nOver the next 12 months, AI will streamline the recruitment process for trials by utilising electronic health records and real-time patient data. This will enable more precise and faster identification of suitable candidates for more successful trials. We are already seeing signs of this transformation with AI-powered platforms significantly reducing recruitment timelines by more accurately matching patients to trial criteria. Such improvements will enhance trial effectiveness and accelerate the pace of medical innovation.\n\nAI compliance platforms will see wide adoption\n\n2025 will see the rise of AI-powered compliance platforms that provide for the real-time monitoring of regulatory adherence across clinical trials, drug manufacturing, and elsewhere. As regulatory requirements grow increasingly complex, such AI solutions will be extremely helpful in managing compliance data in real-time, allowing organisations to maintain operational integrity.\n\n2025 will mark a turning point for data science and AI in life sciences, redefining what\u2019s achievable across the industry. From revolutionising drug discovery and diagnostics to streamlining documentation and compliance, models are accelerating the pace of innovation and enabling breakthroughs that were once unimaginable.\n\nWhile the opportunities are immense, challenges remain. Ethical considerations, data privacy concerns, and navigating complex regulatory frameworks will require careful attention to ensure AI\u2019s potential is realised responsibly. But data science will undoubtedly prove itself as a transformative force reshaping the way we develop therapies, conduct trials, and deliver care. As the industry continues to embrace these capabilities, 2025 is destined to be the year where life sciences once again pushes the boundaries of innovation \u2013 enhancing lives and advancing healthcare on a global scale."

            "article_content": "New, AI-enabled tools and approaches spark aggressive investments to improve insights and decision-making, ISG Provider Lens\u2122 report says\n\nSTAMFORD, Conn., January 13, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Enterprises in the U.S. are making major investments in analytics and AI to fully realize their data\u2019s potential, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm.\n\nThe 2024 ISG Provider Lens\u2122 Advanced Analytics and AI Services report for the U.S. finds that AI is turning analytics into a more powerful tool for data science and an enabler of business transformation. U.S. enterprise investments in AI, along with cloud technologies and more flexible data architectures, are directly aligned with strategic business goals.\n\n\"Companies can unlock deeper insights and drive significant business value when their data is accessible and integrated into operations,\" said Kathy Rudy, chief data and analytics officer at ISG. \"Service providers play a crucial role in making this possible.\"\n\nEnterprises in the U.S. are at the forefront of adopting augmented analytics, which uses AI and ML to automatically identify insights, trends and patterns in data without manual intervention, ISG says. Such systems provide data discovery, predictive analytics and natural-language processing (NLP) to help companies more quickly acquire useful insights into their business. Generative AI, likewise, is expected to expand the ability to generate advanced insights at scale.\n\nThe U.S. is also a leading region in the democratization of data, a full-fledged trend toward making data accessible to a broad range of users in an organization, the report says. Using self-service analytics platforms, low-code/no-code tools and user-friendly dashboards, U.S. enterprises empower non-technical users without specialized skills to analyze and use data \u2014 often by making simple queries through NLP.\n\nMany organizations in the U.S. are using embedded analytics, an increasingly popular approach that makes data analysis a part of everyday business processes rather than a separate task, ISG says. This allows employees to make informed decisions within their usual workflows instead of switching to other systems or tools.\n\nEnterprises in the U.S., especially large ones, are adopting data mesh architectures to make data available across organizations without taking away departmental control, the report says. Rather than centralizing all information in one data warehouse or lake, these companies are creating smaller repositories that are widely accessible but controlled by local departments, complying with governance regulations.\n\nStory Continues"

Now it often provides higher quality, stronger security, better privacy, unparalleled extensibility, and access to innovation compared to proprietary rivals. It is no coincidence that 96% of all software today relies on open source, and large enterprises are increasingly inclined to invest in OSS-based solutions to capitalize on these advantages.\n\nFor venture investors like myself, this shift in market preferences represents a significant opportunity to fund the next generation of OSS-based category leaders in enterprise software. And a few notable trends will likely shape how this market area will likely evolve in 2025 and beyond.\n\nRise of open source AI\n\nThe rapid development of foundational large language models, related AI infrastructure, and their applications has ignited debates around the crucial AI challenges. Many of these issues \u2014 such as transparency, adaptability, and security \u2014 can be addressed through openness. After the initial wave led by closed-source pioneers like OpenAI and Anthropic, a new cohort of open source AI models, including Meta\u2019s Llama and Mistral AI, is now raising the tide and boosting the global AI ecosystem."

            "article_content": "Investing.com -- OpenAI's leading executives have announced plans to host events in Washington DC and two key swing states, aiming to strengthen support for investments in artificial intelligence (AI). This move comes as the company adapts to significant shifts in the US political landscape since the launch of ChatGPT.\n\nLater this month, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, along with other top personnel, will convene a meeting with policymakers in Washington. The purpose of this gathering is to discuss a new \"economic blueprint\" for AI, according to the company. The policy proposals, which were made public on Monday, urge the public and private sectors to collaborate in areas such as energy and infrastructure. This is part of a strategy to maintain the US's lead over China in AI, a pitch that is likely to resonate with the incoming Trump administration.\n\nOpenAI, based in San Francisco, also intends to host events in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Alabama in the upcoming months. The company will announce new AI projects in each of these states, as stated by OpenAI's Vice President of Global Affairs, Chris Lehane, in an interview with Bloomberg News. These announcements are being framed as part of a fresh \"Innovating for America\" initiative that aims to stimulate economic activity around AI across the country.\n\nOver the last year, OpenAI and Altman have been urging the Biden administration to facilitate the construction of more data centers and the development of energy resources required for AI. Currently, OpenAI and other AI firms are adapting to the uncertainty surrounding the incoming Trump administration's AI strategy.\n\nThe President-elect, Donald Trump, is anticipated to revoke crucial elements of the Biden administration's AI agenda, including a 2023 executive order on artificial intelligence. Elon Musk, a supporter of Trump, has recently gained more influence in Washington. This has raised concerns that Musk might advocate for policies that benefit his own companies, including startup xAI, which is a competitor to OpenAI.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

            "article_content": "The lack of interpretability in black-box AI models presents several risks, including:\n\n1. Bias and Discrimination: Black-box models often reflect the biases present in the data from which they learn. Because these models lack adequate transparency, biases can emerge, leading to over- or underrepresentation of certain groups in the population, ultimately favoring one group over another.\n\n2. Lack of Accountability: In high-stakes sectors such as criminal justice and healthcare, AI systems make critical decisions without being able to explain their reasoning. This lack of accountability can be problematic when a wrong decision results in negative consequences, as it becomes difficult to attribute responsibility.\n\n3. Trust Breakdown: As AI technology becomes more widespread, establishing trust is essential for its acceptance. If users do not understand or trust the decisions made by AI, it could lead to resistance against the technology, limiting its potential benefits.\n\n4. Regulatory Compliance: When governments implement regulations concerning AI transparency, organizations that utilize black-box models may face challenges in meeting legal standards, putting them at risk of fines or restrictions."

But the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) which includes fewer tech stocks, rose 0.5%.\n\nStocks are shaping up for another rough session after Friday's plunge, which wiped out all year-to-date gains for Wall Street's major gauges. A hot December jobs report rattled markets, spurring concern that signs of strength in the economy will encourage the Federal Reserve to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added to recent gains to touch a 14-month high, trading not far off 4.8% as US bonds sold off. Meanwhile, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) surged to a two-year high against major currency peers, with the UK pound (GBPUSD=X), in particular, coming under pressure.\n\nAs of Monday, traders are betting there will be no rate cut until at least September, per the CME FedWatch tool, and that the Fed will lower borrowing costs by just 30 basis points in the whole of 2025.\n\nThat has intensified the spotlight on the Consumer Price Index reading for December, due on Wednesday, given one big concern for markets is that inflation won't cool to the central bank's 2% target.\n\nAdding to the gloom, oil prices rose to their highest levels in five months before paring gains after the US imposed tougher sanctions on Russia's crude industry, threatening supply to China and India. Brent (BZ=F) briefly climbed more than 2% to trade above $81 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) changed hands near $78.\n\nShares of Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) slid as all the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech megacaps lost ground in the market turmoil. Europe's largest pension fund revealed that it sold its entire stake in Tesla over CEO Elon Musk's pay package.\n\nElsewhere in corporates, Moderna (MRNA) stock plunged over 22% after the biotech giant cut its 2025 sales forecast by $1 billion amid soft demand for vaccines.\n\nLIVE\n\n6 updates"

That misled observers into concluding\u2014incorrectly as it turns out\u2014that Moscow faces no serious risks to its ability to sustain funding its war.\n\nMore recently, however, Moscow\u2019s heavy reliance on its off-budget, compulsory lending scheme has begun to cause serious, adverse consequences, Kennedy points out.\n\nIt has become the main driver of inflation and rising interest rates, and is also creating the prerequisites for a systemic credit crisis.\n\nFor Moscow, credit event risk\u2014with its seismically disruptive potential\u2014will be of far more immediate concern than slow-burn risks like declining GDP. Moscow now faces a dilemma: the longer it puts off a ceasefire, the greater the risk that credit events\u2014such as corporate and bank bailouts\u2014uncontrollably arise and weaken Moscow\u2019s negotiating leverage.\n\nAccording to Kennedy, this will accordingly give Ukraine and its allies unexpected leverage in potential negotiations.\n\nAs Ukrinform reported earlier, Russia's economy and war efforts are increasingly strained, casting doubt on Vladimir Putin's ability to sustain the war in the long term.\n\nPhoto: EPA/UPG"

            "article_content": "Most computer standards change quickly, with manufacturers adopting new ports, cables, and form factors as soon as they release. Random-access memory (RAM), meanwhile, hasn\u2019t changed all that much in the last decade. So what is the difference between the different types of modern RAM?\n\nSince its introduction in 2014, DDR4 has been the de facto standard for desktop computers, and DDR5 has taken over only in the last few processor generations. Along with a slightly updated form factor, DDR5 raises the total possible capacity and top speed of your memory, adds in some new functionality for overclockers, and reduces its overall power usage.\n\nCapacity and Form Factor\n\nSamsung Electronics Co. 8GB Double-Data-Rate (DDR) 4 memory modules are arranged for a photograph in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, July 9, 2019. Resurgent tensions between Japan and South Korea threaten to wallop chipmakers from Samsung Electronics Co. to SK Hynix Inc., upsetting a carefully choreographed global supply chain by smothering the production of memory chips and other components vital to widely used devices. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty Images Photograph: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll likely notice when shopping for DDR5 memory, at least for consumer options, are higher base capacities. While 16 GB DDR4 kits are commonplace, most DDR5 kits start at 32 GB, typically in a 2 x 16 GB setup. We already recommended 32 GB for new systems, so this is a welcome change to the baseline that should result in fewer unhappy users.\n\nDDR4 and DDR5 are not compatible with each other, despite how similar they look. Memory manufacturers will still stock both varieties for a bit, and they have similar product names, so always double-check you\u2019ve got the right type for your motherboard. All AMD AM5 motherboards use DDR5, while Intel\u2019s 12th generation supports both.\n\nThe two are physically almost identical, and the only visual indicator on most sticks of RAM will be the notch in the pins at the bottom. On DDR5 this notch will be directly in the center, while it\u2019s slightly offset on DDR4. The shifted notch should prevent you from installing the wrong type of memory when building a new computer, but only if you line it up first and see that it doesn\u2019t fit.\n\nFaster Speeds\n\nWhile the sticks may look the same, there are way more horses under the hood. The standard for DDR4 chips technically maxed out at 3,200 MHz, which is the new starting point for DDR5. We\u2019ve only seen a few examples of the top end, but DDR5 supports speeds all the way up to teetering on 8,000 MHz. Don\u2019t expect to put memory like that in your gaming rig any time soon though; most consumer DDR5 RAM tops out around 6,400 MHz."

            "article_content": "The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard is partnering with Manifold to bring a unique life science research and development platform to investigators around the world.\n\nHealthcare data have become increasingly available in larger quantities and are stored across a multitude of cloud service providers. The Broad Institute will begin to use Manifold\u2019s AI platform to address this problem through Manifold\u2019s cloud agnostic architecture. Together, Manifold and Broad will adapt the existing platform to advance genomic research inside and outside of the institute.\n\nThe Broad Institute is a pioneering research lab that began when Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers came together in 2004 with the goal of advancing genomic research through collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe recognized that there were certain types of research projects that were going to be really important to catalyze advances in biomedical research across the entire ecosystem, and yet it would be difficult to accomplish them in a typical academic lab,\u201d Todd Golub, director of the Broad Institute, said in an interview.\n\nManifold was founded by Vinay Seth Mohta, now CEO, in 2016 as a consulting company for using AI in healthcare research. In 2021, Manifold began building its R&D platform to bring no-code software to research institutions.\n\n\u201cWe started in cancer research with a focus there, because we saw that cancer consistently pushed science and technology the hardest, and also, as a result, pushed data the hardest, and where we were seeing a lot of pain,\u201d Mohta said.\n\nManifold has deployed its research and development platform with the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\n\u201cWith the Broad Institute, we're really excited about some of the novel genomics-related capabilities that will bring, based on learning about their use cases, which, by the way, are going to be the use cases everybody's going to have in about three years,\u201d Mohta said. \u201cBecause that's what the Broad does. They're leading the world in science.\u201d\n\nThe lessons from the Broad over its two-decade history will be incorporated into the Manifold platform. One of the key turning points from the Broad's existing software is that researchers will be able to use it without having to know how to code. The organization specifically has plans to do so with its bioinformatics pipeline.\n\nMohta said they plan to add new capabilities every quarter to allow more researchers to come onto the platform, along with collaborations the Broad Institute itself has with other institutions, like companies or other research institutions.\n\n\u201cWith a more modern technical architecture, it really opens up the ability to enable AI more natively, which will again, fuel the future of discovery when we think about what we can do with the data,\u201d Heather Jankins, co-lead of the Data Sciences Platform at the Broad Institute, said.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting feature of the new platform, Golub said, is its \u201cbring your own cloud\u201d capability.\n\nAccording to Manifold, \"bring your own cloud\" means that users of the platform can seamlessly use their existing cloud service provider to power the Manifold research platform.\n\n\u201cScience happens on all clouds, and so we want to make sure that we're enabling science to the maximum,\u201d Jankins said. \u201cFrom that perspective, having a platform that has natively made some cloud agnostic choices is very exciting for us to make sure that we can really leverage using the data, where the data lives.\u201d\n\nResearch institutions use all manner of different cloud providers such as Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. Without the \"bring your own cloud\" capability, researchers may have to consider migrating their data to another cloud to be compatible with a certain research platform or opt out of using it.\n\n\u201cYou have this convergence of two things happening right now, which is an explosion of the amount of data that's possible to generate, and the power of AI making it possible for everybody to ask complex questions of large data sets, regardless of where they're generated,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThat's a very different world than the way research used to work, which is that you do experiments in your own lab and you analyze those results.\u201d\n\nGolub continued: \u201cThis is still very early days of data generation, data aggregation, data and complex data analysis. And so we need to think about the future of this activity and what's going to be needed for the next phase, given that continued explosion of data and need, and that was a motivation for the Broad-Manifold collaboration.\u201d\n\nAlso important to the Broad Institute was Manifold\u2019s ability to create a trusted research environment where access to patient\u2019s genomic data is only allowed by authorized users for a finite period of time.\n\nOne of Manifold\u2019s current customers is the ACS, which has several ongoing cancer studies with 1.5 million participants. With Manifold, the ACS is allowing outside research institutions to use its data while ensuring the data is safely accessed.\n\n\u201cThe point of this exercise is to accelerate the pace at which the world can make important discoveries that will help patients, and without a really scalable, durable, powerful data platform, that's not going to go as quickly as possible, and so we're excited to make that possible,\u201d Golub said."

Although he denied throwing anything, suspicion was raised.\n\nA shocking confrontation leads to discovery\n\nMinutes later, two bikemen arrived, having noticed the man and blood dripping from his bag. They questioned him, but he insisted on getting off near the church.\n\nTogether with the two brothers, they confronted Ajayi and demanded he retrieve the bag from the river. After further questioning, Ajayi ran, but was eventually caught by the group.\n\nA video taken by onlookers shows the intense moment in a nearby bush, with the bikemen attempting to restrain him.\n\nUmaru explained,\n\n\u201cThe bikemen began hitting him with a stick, but we stopped them to ensure the matter was followed up properly. He was weak and could hardly talk.\u201d\n\nWhen police were eventually called, a plainclothes officer questioned the suspect.\n\nAjayi admitted to having been in a relationship with the woman for about a year, and explained that an argument about her phone had escalated, leading to the fatal stabbing.\n\nA chilling confession\n\nThe situation grew more horrifying when the church members opened the bag and discovered a human head inside.\n\nAjayi later explained that a woman had asked him to bring her the head, but he did not know the woman's identity or the victim\u2019s relatives.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time I have seen anything like this in person,\u201d Umaru said, visibly shaken.\n\nAjayi, a suspected gospel singer, according to some social media users, was arrested and taken by the police, but further details of his background have not been verified.\n\nThe church community is reeling from the horrific event, and local authorities have taken charge of the investigation.\n\nHowever, attempts to reach the Nasarawa State police for comment were unsuccessful at the time of publication.\n\nPAY ATTENTION: \u0421heck out news that is picked exactly for YOU \u27a1\ufe0f find the \u201cRecommended for you\u201d block on the home page and enjoy!\n\nSource: Legit.ng"

            "article_content": "Zora Neale Hurston was a philosemite. She believed that the Jews had been victims of stereotyping that started with Moses and that was promoted by the Bible and fed to children in Sunday school. Among other things, it produced the fiction of the Eternal Jew, a type unchanged since the time of the Pharaohs.\n\nIn fact, Hurston thought, the Jews had evolved, just like everyone else. And they had come to believe, long before other people did, in liberty, individualism, and the rights that define liberal democracies. The Jews were Americans thousands of years before there was an America.\n\nThe story of the Jews was extremely important to Hurston, as important as her mission, far better known, to preserve and to celebrate the style, speech, and folklore of the African diaspora\u2014the culture of what she called \u201cthe Negro farthest down.\u201d That mission yielded two works of cultural anthropology, \u201cMules and Men\u201d (1935) and \u201cTell My Horse\u201d (1938), and the novel on which her reputation is built, \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God\u201d (1937).\n\nWhat We\u2019re Reading Discover notable new fiction and nonfiction.\n\nBut Hurston devoted a big portion of her literary career\u2014which stretched from 1921, when she published her first short story in a Howard University literary magazine, to 1960, when she died\u2014to trying to write a history of the Jews. This meant, essentially, rewriting the Bible. It was a colossal ambition, and it is striking, although maybe not surprising, how little attention the effort has received in the critical literature on Hurston, of which there are now shelves full. Between 1975, when she was \u201crediscovered\u201d by Alice Walker, and 2010, more than four hundred doctoral dissertations were written on Hurston. \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God\u201d has sold more than a million copies, and Oprah Winfrey produced a film adaptation. In Hurston\u2019s lifetime, the most any of her books earned in royalties was $943.75.\n\nHurston was a grapho-compulsive. In addition to four published novels and three works of nonfiction, which include an autobiography, \u201cDust Tracks on a Road\u201d (1942), she wrote short stories, poems, plays, essays, reviews, and articles. She also staged concerts and dance performances. By the time she died, she had published more books than any Black woman in history.\n\nAnd she was a tireless correspondent, possibly because for much of her life, despite three somewhat mysterious marriages, she lived alone. An excellent edition of the correspondence, edited by Carla Kaplan, contains more than five hundred letters, and, since Hurston was not shy about writing to people she had never met (she once asked Winston Churchill to contribute an introduction to one of her books; he politely declined, citing poor health), it is believed that there may be hundreds more letters still out there, no one knows where.\n\nLike most freelance writers, she had a fairly high kill rate. Some pieces were rejected or didn\u2019t work out or for some other reason never appeared in print; her autobiography was expurgated by her publisher; and she wrote some or all of at least five novels that were turned down. Only one of these, \u201cThe Life of Herod the Great,\u201d survived in typescript\u2014the others appear to be missing completely. \u201cHerod\u201d has now been published by Amistad in a volume edited by Deborah Plant, an independent scholar. Plant is also the author of a critical biography of Hurston, published in 2007, and the editor of another Hurston manuscript, \u201cBarracoon: The Story of the Last \u2018Black Cargo,\u2019 \u201d which was published in 2018.\n\nHurston spent something like fifteen years researching and writing \u201cHerod.\u201d She called it her \u201cgreat obsession.\u201d This was far more time than she spent on any other book project. She wrote \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God,\u201d for example, in seven weeks, while she was doing field work in Haiti. The \u201cHerod\u201d typescript was partially burned when, after Hurston\u2019s death, workers who were cleaning out her house set fire to a trunk full of papers. An acquaintance driving past saw the flames, grabbed a hose (Hurston was a famous gardener), and put out the fire.\n\nWhat we have of \u201cHerod\u201d is therefore far from a complete work. The final chapters in the Amistad edition are fragmentary, and the book ends abruptly, ten years before Herod\u2019s death. Whether this is because those pages were damaged by fire and water or simply because Hurston hadn\u2019t finished yet is unclear. She did write three prefaces and four introductions; Plant prints what she calls \u201csynthesized versions\u201d of these. In general, the editorial apparatus is fairly minimal.\n\nHurston\u2019s papers are housed at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and, before this new edition, the \u201cHerod\u201d manuscript was read there by Hurston scholars. Their reports did not make a trip to Gainesville seem urgent. Hurston\u2019s first biographer, Robert Hemenway, wrote, \u201cZora\u2019s manuscript suffers from poor characterization, pedantic scholarship, and inconsistent style; the whole performance touches the heart by revealing a talent in ruins.\u201d He said it would have been \u201ca minor work.\u201d\n\nHemenway was a sympathetic biographer. An even more sympathetic biographer, Valerie Boyd, refrained from critical commentary on \u201cHerod\u201d altogether in her book, \u201cWrapped in Rainbows.\u201d Virginia Lynn Moylan, in \u201cZora Neale Hurston\u2019s Final Decade,\u201d described the writing of \u201cHerod,\u201d which was Hurston\u2019s chief preoccupation in those years, and even wrote something about Hurston\u2019s views on the Jews. But she, too, declined to say much about the novel itself.\n\n\u201cHerod\u201d was turned down by Hurston\u2019s publisher, Scribner\u2019s, in 1955. Her editor there, Burroughs Mitchell, known mainly for being the man who rejected three novels by Zora Neale Hurston, explained that the book \u201cdoes not seem to us to accomplish its intention. I mean to say that it does not vividly recreate the man and his time. . . . There is a wealth of fine material here but somehow it has failed to flow in a clear narrative stream. We think the book would prove difficult reading for the layman.\u201d\n\nHurston, characteristically, took this in stride. She was accustomed to adversity. Her field work was supported for a few years in the late nineteen-twenties and early thirties by a white patron and by grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, but she lived mainly on her writing. It was her good fortune to be the sort of person whom other people enjoy helping, but she disliked receiving unreciprocated gifts and did not depend on them. She took low-level jobs when she ran out of funds\u2014she once worked as a maid\u2014and sometimes she had to pawn her typewriter to buy food. For many years, she lived on a houseboat. None of her books sold more than five thousand copies in her lifetime.\n\nWhen Mitchell\u2019s rejection letter came, Hurston was living in Eau Gallie, a tiny town in Florida, in a one-room cabin that she rented for five dollars a week. It was a long way from the Harlem of the nineteen-twenties, where she had cut a flamboyant figure among what she liked to call (although the term was probably not her coinage) the Niggerati. But she\u2019d been born in Alabama and had grown up in Eatonville, Florida, an all-Black town\u2014making her one of very few members of the Harlem Renaissance who was from the American South\u2014and she was a Floridian at heart. She was content in Eau Gallie. \u201cNaturally, I am sorry that you found Herod the Great disappointing,\u201d she replied to Mitchell, \u201cbut do not feel concerned about the refusal upon me. I am my old self and can take it easily.\u201d\n\nShe continued working on the book. In 1958, it was turned down by another house, David McKay, the publisher of Fodor\u2019s travel guides and Ace Comics. In 1959, she wrote to Harper & Brothers to ask \u201cif you would have any interest in the book I am laboring upon at present\u2014a life of Herod the Great. One reason I approach you is because you will realize that any publisher who offers a life of Herod as it really was, and naturally different from the groundless legends which have been built up around his name has to have courage.\u201d Harper & Brothers was Richard Wright\u2019s publisher\u2014as the reference to \u201ccourage\u201d was intended to remind the recipients. But they passed on \u201cHerod.\u201d This was Hurston\u2019s last extant letter.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to publish an unfinished book, but it feels a little unfair to judge it. Maybe what we have is not the final version. But, based on what we do have, Hurston\u2019s biographers were not wrong: her voice is missing. There is no poetry in \u201cHerod.\u201d Instead, we are walked stiffly through the career of the man the Romans treated as the king of the client state of Judea, which he governed from 40 B.C.E. until his death, thirty-six years later\u2014an impressive run at a time when one held on to power by pre\u00ebmptively killing one\u2019s rivals, something the historical Herod was quite good at.\n\nAnd that is, of course, how most people know him today. In the Gospel of Matthew, it is said that, after Herod, the King of the Jews, learned of the birth of a new King of the Jews, he ordered the slaughter of all male children under two years of age in Bethlehem\u2014the Massacre of the Innocents, a scene that became iconic in Western art. (The Herod in the Bible who beheads John the Baptist to please his stepdaughter Salome and who hands Jesus over to Pontius Pilate was Herod Antipas, Herod the Great\u2019s son. He\u2019s the bad Herod.)\n\n\u201cI love cardio day!\u201d Cartoon by Lonnie Millsap Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nHurston told a friend that her interest in Herod the Great began when she learned that scholars had doubts about the story in Matthew. It is inconsistent with the account of Jesus\u2019 birth in the other Gospels, and is probably what is known as a \u201cfulfillment citation,\u201d something inserted to validate a prophecy in the Hebrew Bible\u2014in this case, from Jeremiah. It is also prefigured (another Biblical device) by Pharaoh\u2019s order, in Exodus, to kill all male babies born to Hebrew mothers."

Initially claiming to help the scavengers trapped aboard the Romulus, he eventually becomes an impediment to their escape.\n\nFor the recreation, which was made with the consent of Holm\u2019s estate, a combination of CGI and puppetry was used to achieve the likeness of the actor, who passed away in 2020.\n\nSpeaking to Empire recently, Alvarez agreed with criticisms of the scene, saying: \u201cI wasn\u2019t 100 per cent happy with some of the shots, where you could feel a bit more the CG intervention. So, for people that react negatively, I don\u2019t blame them\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlvarez continued: \u201cWe fixed it. We made it better for the release right now. I convinced the studio we need to spend the money and make sure we give the companies that were involved in making it the proper time to finish it and do it right. It\u2019s so much better\u201d. This was done, explains, by lessening the influence of CGI on the character \u201cWhat we did (for the streaming version) was revert a lot more to the puppet\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s way better.\u201d\n\nFascinating\u2026 streaming versions of Alien: Romulus have apparently made some tweaks to certain shots of Rook VFX (via Reddit) pic.twitter.com/XMEY6iT7QG \u2014 Alien Theory (@Alien_Theory) January 10, 2025\n\nAlien: Romulus was a box office hit and critically well-received. NME\u2019s five-star review described it being \u201cas thrilling and scary as the original\u201d, while arguing that Rook\u2019s appearance \u201cworks well, both technically and narratively\u201d. Fans did not agree, however, posting their displeasure online.\n\nthe CGI Ian Holm ruined the entire movie for me. I checked out as soon as it popped up. can't imagine a way to improve on it other than removing it entirely, which would break the cheap nostalgia fueling the whole thing https://t.co/vfEkP9UJnf \u2014 \ud83d\udfe1 The tumboy \ud83d\udfe1 (@TheTumboy) January 10, 2025\n\nRecommended\n\nevery time they cut back to the disgusting CGI Ian Holm in #AlienRomulus pic.twitter.com/daC5c6DNhq \u2014 Avry \u2013 Currently Reckoning (@AvryRobinOtt) August 19, 2024\n\nTaking to X (formerly Twitter), one fan wrote: \u201cthe CGI Ian Holm ruined the entire movie for me.
