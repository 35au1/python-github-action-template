            "date": "Psychology Today1h",
            "source": "Psychology Today",
            "article_content": "The current scare over mass sightings of drones over the United States can be understood through the lens of social psychology. The history of the United States is replete with similar waves of not only UFO reports but mass sightings of all sorts of strange creatures and extraordinary things. Many years ago, I completed a Masters thesis on the history of UFO waves and kindred phenomena, which opened my eyes to an array of scares that are driven by similar psychological processes.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the drone scare. The United States has experienced dozens of similar scares involving unidentified flying objects (UFOs) over the past 130 years. Here are just a few:\n\n1915, Eastern Canada: Between 1915 and 1917, there was a series of phantom aircraft sightings by what was rumored to have been German sympathizers in the U.S. who were said to be conducting aerial reconnaissance missions as a prelude to an eventual attack. British consul-general Sir Courtney Bennett, stationed in New York, stoked the scare when he made the sensational claim in 1915 that thousands of highly trained German Americans had been drilling in Niagara Falls and Buffalo and were planning to invade Canada from northwestern New York State.\n\n1916, Delaware, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C.: A spate of mysterious airplane sightings were reported amid claims that German covert agents were going to target military installations and government offices. Popular books like German-American Conspiracies in America by William Skaggs and The German-American Plot by Frederic Wile fueled rumors that a prime target for such activities was military bases along the Eastern Seaboard due to their close proximity to Europe.\n\n1917, New Hampshire: There were mass sightings of mysterious lights over the strategic naval base at Portsmouth, prompting fears that German agents were spying in readiness for an attack. One week after the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, two National Guardsmen from the Sixth Massachusetts Infantry near Portsmouth opened fire on a mysterious aerial light thought to be of German origin.\n\n1947, Nationwide: Idaho businessman Kenneth Arnold\u2019s sighting of nine disc-shaped objects while flying over Washington State triggered a deluge of \u201cflying saucer\u201d reports that summer.\n\n1974, Midwest: A wave of UFO reports coinciding with a spate of \u201ccattle mutilations\u201d took place.\n\nThe phantom airplane scares during the war years were almost certainly not aircraft. The airplanes of the period were crude contraptions and treacherous to fly, particularly at night. Taking off and landing from a secret base in the mountains and remaining aloft for hours at a time was impossible. Most of these war years\u2019 sightings correspond with the appearance of Venus or were fire balloons similar to Chinese lanterns of today that were later found in the vicinity.\n\nWhen Kenneth Arnold was interviewed after his 1947 sighting, he told a reporter that the crescent-shaped objects he had spotted moved \u201clike a saucer would if you skipped it across the water.\u201d The journalist mistakenly wrote that they were \u201csaucer-like,\u201d which triggered a spate of \u201cflying saucer\u201d reports.\n\nDuring the 1974 \u201ccattle mutilation\u201d and UFO wave\u2014great significance was placed on media reports about farmers finding mutilated cows and UFOs being spotted nearby. Such assertions are meaningless given that there are always mysterious objects in the sky, ranging from Venus to small aircraft. The dramatic media reports prompted residents to be more aware of dead cows and aerial lights.\n\nAs it turned out, several studies of cattle mutilations, including one by a former FBI agent, concluded that the animals had died of natural causes and were attacked by predators: buzzards, blowflies, coyotes, and so on. The wounds gave the impression of surgical incisions as they tended to eat the exposed parts, such as the eyes and sex organs.\n\nSeveral factors dove these scares, which have parallels with mass sightings of Bigfoot, chupacabras, and the Loch Ness Monster. These waves were typically triggered by a sighting that received sensational media coverage. This prompted readers to scrutinize their environment\u2014the lakes, woods, and the sky\u2014for evidence of the reported object or creature.\n\nThere are always mysterious things swimming or floating in lakes and moving through the woods, rustling bushes. Ordinary, we don\u2019t pay much attention. But prompted by media reports, people tend to notice things that were always there.\n\nNew Jersey has one of the busiest flight paths in the world. Also, human perception is notoriously unreliable, as are our brains. There is a tendency to see what we expect to see.\n\nIn this regard, believing is seeing. The brain is wired to connect dots and create meaning where there is none. The face of Mars. The image of Jesus on a tortilla. Throw in fears about nefarious foreign actors in the form of the Iranians or Chinese\u2014along with widespread distrust of the government and politicians\u2014and you have the recipe for a drone scare.\n\nIn the words of Carl Sagan, \u201cWhere we have strong emotions, we\u2019re liable to fool ourselves.\u201d"

            "article_content": "In today\u2019s rapidly changing technology landscape, machine learning and AI enable us to redefine industries and change how we interact with the world. AI allows developers to create more intelligent, flexible, and efficient applications. Arm, due to its unique position in the industry, has been enabling AI across a variety of platforms for more than a decade.\n\nIn this article, I want to detail how Arm\u2019s technology allows developers to focus on innovation and the unique aspects of the applications they are developing while utilizing Arm\u2019s existing technology.\n\nYou don\u2019t need an NPU for AI applications For over seven years, I\u2019ve been making content about the advantages and disadvantages of different machine learning accelerators \u2014 called NPUs. These processors have their place in devices, but one myth is that you need one to run machine learning or AI tasks. That\u2019s simply not true. AI tasks don\u2019t hinge exclusively on NPUs; they can run on anything from a CPU to a GPU. With the technology found in Arm v8 and Arm v9 chips, you can run accelerated machine learning tasks particularly well on Arm CPUs.\n\nMatrix multiplication is the key mathematical operation at the heart of machine learning and AI. GPUs and NPUs are good at matrix multiplication. However, modern Arm CPUs are also good at this processing task and have hardware accelerators that enable it, too. Whether it\u2019s Arm v8 or Arm v9, Cortex-A or Cortex-X, or Arm\u2019s Neoverse processors, they all have different technologies that allow the acceleration of matrix multiplication operations.\n\nFor example, Arm\u2019s Neon technology, and Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) are both available in Arm processors, there are also 8-bit matrix-by-matrix multiplication instructions in the Arm instruction set. In smartphones and on the edge devices, Scalable Matrix Extensions (SME) are available inside Arm processors. These technologies allow the CPU to perform accelerated matrix operations without a GPU or NPU.\n\nArm\u2019s Kleidi technology\n\nArm\n\nBeyond the hardware systems, Kleidi is a central part of Arm\u2019s strategy for enabling AI on Arm-based mobile and server platforms. It covers a range of resources and partnerships for helping developers accelerate AI seamlessly on Arm, including a library of high-performance machine learning kernels called KleidiAI, which has been optimized for Arm CPUs using those various hardware accelerators.Kleidi is available on GitLab, and these kernels have been integrated into various frameworks that are ready for developers to use. As a result, we now have hardware acceleration for Arm CPUs, supporting various machine learning technologies, from classical machine learning to current generative AI.\n\nArm has integrated Kleidi technology into popular AI frameworks such as PyTorch and ExecuTorch, resulting in significant out-of-the-box performance improvements for developers. This integration ensures that developers can seamlessly leverage Arm\u2019s optimized libraries within their existing workflows, gaining up to a 12x performance improvement with minimal effort.\n\nArm partnered with Meta to ensure the recently launched Llama 3.2 model works perfectly on Arm CPUs. The availability of smaller LLMs that enable fundamental text-based generative AI workloads, such as the one billion and three billion parameter versions, is critical for enabling AI inference at scale. Arm CPUs can run larger models, such as Llama 3.2 with 11 billion parameters and even the 90 billion parameter model in the cloud. These larger models are an excellent fit for CPU-based inference workloads in the cloud that generate text and images.\n\nThe 11 billion parameter version of Llama 3.2, running on an Amazon AWS Graviton4 processor, can achieve 29.3 tokens per second during the generation phase, and that\u2019s just on the CPU. Thanks to the collaboration between Arm and Meta on the ExecuTorch framework, you can now access optimal performance by running those models on the edge. Running the new Llama 3.2 three billion LLM on an Arm-powered smartphone through the Arm CPU optimizations leads to a 5x improvement in prompt processing and a 3x improvement in token generation, achieving 19.92 tokens per second during the generation phase.\n\nIf you want a demonstration of this, check out my video above.\n\nA massive boost for developers\n\nArm\n\nThanks to these advancements, the possibilities for developers are enormous. Think of everything you could do with a large language model running on a phone using an Arm CPU \u2014 no GPU, no NPU, no cloud, just the CPU. Arm\u2019s approach is performance portability, which means that AI developers can optimize once and then deploy their models across various platforms without making any modifications. This is particularly useful for developers who need to deploy models both on the edge, in a smartphone, and in the cloud. By using Arm, developers can be sure that their model will also perform well on other platforms once optimized for one platform.\n\nArm has some great resources for developers, including documentation on how to accelerate generative AI and ML workloads when you choose to run them on Arm CPUs, in addition to running AI and ML on Android devices."

He said he was trying to track a mystery drone but his drone was shut down while the mystery thing remained airborne.\"There was a drone just hanging out,\" he told FOX 5 New York. \"I had full battery life. Not 3 minutes into the flight, I lost control of the drone.\"He said he saw a warning flash across the screen of his controller and the battery died with the drone coming down. He understood that his drone was probably shot down because it was a restricted flight area but the thing that he was trying to approach continued to fly. The paranormal investigator lives near the Picatinny Arsenal, an Army facility near where dozens of sightings have been reported in recent weeks. Since it was an Army area, it was possible that his drone was shut down but the other one continuing to fly seems to establish speculation theories that these mystery drones are probably sanctioned by the government and the Feds are well aware of them.As Michael B shared his horrifying experience with MSNBC, he said the issue, to him, seems more serious than just misidentified aircraft. \"At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,\" he said adding that he could not figure out what it was.Michael B added that it's clear to him that these mystery drones are capable of flying in restricted zones. He said he can usually detect what other objects are on the sky by using his radar, none of these mystery things are on flight radar."

'At one point, it even asked for my phone number and I said, 'Nah. I think we're good at this point.''\n\nWitt asked Michael B: 'What do you think that is? What do you think people are seeing in the sky? And why only at night?'\n\n'At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,' Michael B responded.\n\nThe Terror Talk host also noted that he has technology to detect objects in the sky, 'none of these things that we go after are on flight radar.'\n\nTo demonstrate the government's drone deterrence capabilities, the pilot brought a DJI brand drone to a parking lot near Morristown Airport, a local flight corridor that's achieved national prominence due to Trump's use. 'Restricted,' he noted pointing at his drone's controls\n\nThe drone pilot - known to fans of his paranormal investigation series 'Terror Talk' as Michael B (pictured) - witnessed his own drone crash and burn as he attempted to steer it near one of the many unexplained drone UFOs that have swarmed NJ. The mystery drone was 'unaffected'\n\nMichael B told MSNBC that he believes the government is keeping the truth about New Jersey's unidentified drones a mystery on purpose.\n\nThe real answers, he said, are likely to be 'secrets that the government don't want us to know [...] either that or aliens.'\n\n'At this point, I think that someone knows what they are,' he told the station.\n\n'What they could be \u2014 I have no idea,' the paranormal investigator admitted, although he emphasized that he was taking it as a personal mission to keep monitoring the state's mystery drones to get answers.\n\nThe FBI has fielded over 5,000 complaints in the course of this drone UFO wave, in progress, but noted that only 100 of these cases now warrant further investigation.\n\nThe US Department of Homeland Security official has also noted that sightings due to mass concern over the drones has led to many false positives.\n\n'We're confident that many of the reported drone sightings are, in fact, manned aircraft being misidentified as drones,' DHS officials said.\n\nBut the cases above sensitive military bases and US Coast Guard ships off the Jersey shore continue to worry state officials, federal investigators and the US military.\n\nThe FBI and other agencies are investigating the strange activity, but a representative from the Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday, Dec. 11: 'We have no more information as to where these drones are coming from, where they're launching from, where they're landing'\n\nOfficials and residents have also seen truly odd, well-lit drones that do not resemble fixed-wing aircraft (example above) deepening the mystery of the craft's origins and intent\n\nPicatinny Arsenal told press that sightings of the unidentified drones, capable of beating their counter-drone defenses, has now climbed to 11 confirmed cases.\n\n'While the source and cause of these aircraft operating in our area remain unknown,' Picatinny's garrison commander, Lt Col Craig A. Bonham II, said, 'we can confirm that they are not the result of any Picatinny Arsenal-related activities.'\n\nAmid the uncertainty, the president-elect called for answers from the US Government as he slammed the Biden administration and urged them to shoot down the UFOs.\n\nBut this was rejected by DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas who said that the government does not have the authority to neutralize the drones."

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve has identified five species new to global science: a gecko (Hemidactylus sp.) marked by brown stripes and white nodules, the Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus), plus three plants \u2014 a globe thistle, a mignonette, and a hogbean. In addition, the Reserve recorded three species new to Saudi Arabia and extended the known global range of 34 more. These outcomes, the result of four years of fieldwork by Saudi and international experts, increase the total number of terrestrial species documented in the Reserve to 791. Although the Reserve covers only 1% of the Kingdom's terrestrial area, it is home to more than half of Saudi Arabia's terrestrial species, reinforcing its role as a vital refuge for biodiversity in a changing climate.\n\nNewly discovered gecko Hemidactylus sp, in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve\n\nAndrew Zaloumis, CEO of the Reserve, emphasized the global significance of these findings, stating: \"At a moment in time when the IUCN has warned that 28% of species globally are now at risk of extinction these discoveries are significant. They reaffirm the importance of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve as a bioclimatic refugia, particularly as climate change is increasingly impacting the customary habitats of many of these species. Testament to this is the Reserve's iconic Wadi Al-Disah, with its 200+ species, a key site on the UNESCO World Heritage Bioclimatic Refugia of Western Arabia tentative list. None of this would have been possible without the strong collaboration of natural scientists from the Kingdom and 14 other countries with the Reserve over the last 4 years to conduct multi-season field surveys.\"\n\nAmong the five species new to science are two reptiles and three plants, each with unique ecological and cultural significance. The gecko (Hemidactylus sp.), currently undergoing DNA analysis, features striking brown horizontal stripes from neck to tail and white nodules along its back. This gecko preys on small invertebrates like mosquitoes, playing an essential role in pest control within desert ecosystems. The Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus) is a small, non-venomous species that is bright red with a distinctive black collar.\n\nThe three new plants to science are firstly the globe thistle (Echinops sp. aff. glaberrimus) from the Asteraceae family. It produces vibrant blooms that support pollinators and promote ecosystem health. Historically, it has been used medicinally to treat infections and inflammations. Secondly the mignonette, (Reseda sp. aff. muricata), known for its herbal properties, is often used in teas and perfumery. And thirdly, in contrast, the hogbean (Hyoscyamus sp.) from the Nightshade family has a more complex history, having been used both as a poison and in early anesthesiology and palliative care.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Scientists have announced the discovery of a species of lipstick vine that is completely new to science, found in the depths of the Philippine rainforest.\n\nThis species, which has never been documented in botanical records, has sparked a wave of excitement among scientists and nature enthusiasts alike.\n\nAn expedition into the heart of Luzon\n\nA daring expedition by a team of botanists in 2022 led them into Barangay Balbalasang rainforest, a remote and virtually inaccessible part of Luzon island.\n\nThe journey began with days of rugged travel to reach the rainforest, which was filled with unforgiving thickets that demanded to be sliced with machetes. In these wild conditions, the researchers discovered their prize.\n\nThe team included Jayson Mansibang, Adriane Tobias, and Pastor L. Malabrigo from the University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os, along with Dr. Chris Thorogood, Deputy Director and Head of Science at the Oxford Botanic Garden and Arboretum.\n\nThe researchers stayed with the Banao Tribe, an indigenous community that protects the local forest.\n\nA lipstick vine unlike any other\n\nAmong the species found in the forest, one stood out \u2013 a specimen of the lipstick vine, a genus known as Aeschynanthus.\n\nThis plant had a distinct pattern of delicate purple mottling which painted its flowers in a pattern similar to that of a European foxglove.\n\n\u201cWe were trekking through dense vegetation when suddenly we spotted a luminous white, purple-spotted flower dangling above our heads,\u201d said Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cWe suspected immediately that it was new to science. It\u2019s so exciting that beautiful species like this are still there waiting to be described.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of a new lipstick vine\n\nThe team named the plant Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus from the Latin \u2018penta,\u2019 meaning five, and \u2018trichomatus\u2019 referring to the trichomes \u2013 hair-like outgrowths deep in the throats of the flowers.\n\nLipstick vines, encompassing nearly 180 tropical and subtropical species, are known for their tubular, bud-like appearance.\n\nThese vines, often adorning other plants and trees, boast vibrantly colored flowers that attract birds for pollination.\n\nConservation concerns amid climate change\n\nSadly, this newfound beauty already faces a critical risk of extinction. Rapid climate change, driving increasingly intense typhoons, relentlessly threatens the plant\u2019s natural habitat.\n\nThe Barangay Balbalasang rainforest remains remarkably intact, housing numerous species that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The researchers hope that the new discovery can help support conservation efforts to protect the region.\n\n\u201cWe dedicate this discovery not only to the unique beauty of the Banao forest but also to the Banao People themselves, who, through their care and stewardship, have ensured the conservation of rare species within these precious forests,\u201d said Tobias.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to find Aeschynanthus in such an environment, and as young botanists, we were thrilled to discover something so distinct.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s plant data darkspots\n\n\u201cMany new species remain undocumented in the world\u2019s \u2018plant data darkspots\u2019 \u2013 up to 15% of the world\u2019s flora in fact,\u201d noted Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cFinding these \u2018known unknowns\u2019 is essential for understanding and protecting biodiversity. That\u2019s what makes discoveries such as this one so important for conservation science.\u201d\n\nEcological importance of lipstick vines\n\nThe discovery of Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus sheds light on the ecological importance of lipstick vines in tropical ecosystems.\n\nAs epiphytes, these plants grow on trees without harming them, creating microhabitats that support diverse wildlife.\n\nTheir vividly colored flowers play a vital role in attracting pollinators, particularly birds, which are essential for maintaining the delicate balance of tropical rainforests.\n\nBeyond their ecological contributions, lipstick vines are indicators of environmental health. Their presence often signifies a well-preserved ecosystem, as these plants thrive only in stable and intact habitats.\n\nProtecting a unique rainforest\n\nThe discovery of this new species in Barangay Balbalasang emphasizes the rainforest\u2019s unique biodiversity and the urgent need to safeguard it.\n\nWith nearly 180 known species of Aeschynanthus, each adapted to its specific environment, the newly discovered species offers valuable insights into the evolution of plant-pollinator relationships and the resilience of tropical flora in the face of climate change.\n\nProtecting Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus is not just about preserving a single species; it is about safeguarding the intricate web of life that it supports.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Nordic Journal of Botany.\n\nImage Credit: Chris Thorogood\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

The 21-month trip presents unique challenges, particularly keeping people healthy during such a long space voyage. But what once seemed like an impossible solution is now gathering momentum: Hibernation.\n\nIn winter, many mammals enter a state of torpor, dropping their body temperature and slowing down their metabolism and brain activity to save energy. However, people can\u2019t hibernate for a few reasons: Our bodies can\u2019t store enough fat without harming ourselves, function at such low energy and brain activity levels, or survive a massive drop in body temperature. (Read about surprising hibernators in nature.)\n\nGerald Kerth, a zoologist at the University of Greifswald in Germany, studies hibernation in bats, which are smaller and easier to research than, say, brown bears."

Thanks to a little bit of patience and determination, I\u2019ve made my way through the waitlist, and now I have the power to generate just about anything I can think up \u2014 within some well-defined limits.\n\nWith that great power and responsibility has come something else, though: a great learning curve. Even though I\u2019m enjoying Sora and am impressed by its capabilities, I\u2019m having trouble nailing down the perfect prompts to get videos I\u2019m pleased with. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a matter of practice, but here\u2019s how my first few days with Sora have gone.\n\nHave you used OpenAI's Sora to generate videos yet? 23 votes Yes 26 % No 74 %\n\nVideo creation at your fingertips?\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about how Sora works \u2014 or at least how to access the powerful video generation tool. Although it comes from OpenAI, and you need to be a ChatGPT Plus or Pro member to start creating, you can\u2019t get to Sora through the main ChatGPT interface. Instead, you have to head directly to the Sora website (sora.com), where you\u2019re met with a gallery of Featured clips that set the bar incredibly high.\n\nAt least, they set the bar high in my own head. I scrolled through a few of them, looked at their prompts, watched them run smoothly, and figured I could do the same. After all, my prompts would be run through the same adaptation of DALL-E 3 that theirs had been, so they should look just as good, right? It\u2019s not quite that easy. Sure, typing in prompts is quite easy, but figuring out what Sora responds best to is a bit harder.\n\nCreating videos is as easy as typing out what you want to see... or at least it seems that way on paper.\n\nBefore we get to the challenges, though, I should probably clarify some of Sora\u2019s current limitations. Unlike Google\u2019s Pixel Studio or another basic image generator, you can\u2019t simply sit and run Sora to your heart\u2019s content \u2014 at least not as a ChatGPT Plus member for $20 per month.\n\nInstead, you\u2019re given a bank of 1,000 credits, which you can spend on video generation as you see fit. Everything you change within your prompt, from the aspect ratio to the duration to the resolution, will cost a certain number of those credits until you run out for the month. Brand new videos cost anywhere from 20 credits to 2,000 credits, and you can check out a helpful table of costs here \u2014 something I wish I\u2019d found before I spent 260 credits in about 20 minutes. You\u2019re also limited to one video generation at a time and a maximum resolution of 720p as a Plus member.\n\nIf you spring for a ChatGPT Pro membership, the limits are much looser but the price is much, much higher at $200 per month. Instead of 1,000 credits, you get 10,000 credits for priority videos, after which you get unlimited video generations; they just take a bit longer \u2014 OpenAI calls them \u201crelaxed videos.\u201d Pro members can also generate five videos at a time, bump them up to 1080p, and let them run as long as 20 seconds.\n\nUnfortunately, though, no matter what tier of ChatGPT you pay for, none of Sora\u2019s videos have audio to them, so you\u2019ll have to download your clips and sync music or sound effects after you\u2019ve nailed down the visuals. OpenAI has suggested that support for audio will reach Sora eventually, it\u2019s just not there yet.\n\nHow hard could it be?\n\nWith that basic introduction out of the way, the rest of using Sora to generate videos should be easy, right? Well, yes and no. Although typing in your prompt, choosing your settings from the menu at the bottom, and waiting for your video to generate is that easy, it\u2019s much harder to come up with something worthy of Sora\u2019s ever-changing Featured feed.\n\nIn an attempt to share my limited cache of tokens for the month, as soon as I got access to Sora, I reached out to my colleague Mitja. He and I had been discussing how quickly we might get access to the platform, so I figured he might have some good ideas for generations right off the bat. As it turned out, his first thought was something I never could have imagined: Ten zebras in suits dancing to a Michael Jackson song in front of the Sydney Opera House while eating pesto ravioli. It may seem like a weird video to make, but if Sora can handle that amount of detail, then it\u2019s definitely the real deal.\n\nSora will take a stab at almost anything you ask for, but you have to describe it just right.\n\nOnce I finished laughing at the idea, I ran it through Sora and waited for the result. Technically, the final product got most things right. It put a group of zebras in suits in front of the Sydney Opera House, and they all had green plates in their hands. However, the number fluctuated between eight and about 12 zebras, there was no indication that it was a Michael Jackson song, and the pesto ravioli was definitely just a green plate \u2014 close, but not quite right. More worryingly, I had bumped the cost of the video up to 100 tokens because I hoped a ten-second clip would show more dancing. It had not.\n\nI\u2019ve since learned, however, that Sora\u2019s Storyboard tool is a must-have for pretty much anything involving complex motion. It allows you to drag and drop clips along your five- or ten-second timeline, helping Sora break up the action and flow from one direction to another. So, in an attempt to draw a little bit more action out of my zebra friends, I jumped into the storyboard and split the dancing and the pesto ravioli into two separate actions spaced out over the five-second clip, then I used ChatGPT to punch up my description \u2014 yet another built-in feature of the Storyboard.\n\nOnce again\u2026 It kind of worked, but it kind of didn\u2019t. Yes, I got the zebras, and they were in front of the Sydney Opera House, but they had given up on dancing, and when asked to eat some of their ravioli, they suddenly grew human hands to hold their forks. Sorry, Featured feed, but I think I\u2019m a long way off.\n\nI\u2019ve also tried more natural prompts, like macaroni penguins sliding down icebergs into the sea, and more fantastical prompts, like a piece of toast with a Pixar-like face leaping out of a toaster, and the story has mostly been the same. Sora handles some pieces of each prompt incredibly well, but you have to describe your scene with just the right amount of detail. Too much, and Sora begins to merge different elements. Too little, and you get a relatively boring finished product.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, there\u2019s even more to Sora than I\u2019ve touched, especially when it comes to editing. The video generator also packs the ability to re-cut, remix, and blend clips to expand on an idea, join one video to another, or clip out elements that don\u2019t work well. But again, I\u2019d still like to nail down a video that looks good the first time.\n\nChallenges aside, I\u2019m excited for the future\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nOverall, it\u2019s fair to call my first few days using Sora a mixed bag. Has the video generator been perfect? No, but I can\u2019t entirely blame OpenAI for that. This is my first shot at generating videos based purely on text, so I\u2019m not surprised that I\u2019ve struggled to nail down the right level of detail. So far, I\u2019ve given Sora too much information, and I\u2019ve given it too little, which means that nailing just the right prompt has to be around the corner.\n\nMore importantly, though, I\u2019ve been thoroughly impressed by what Sora promises to do. The videos I can create as a ChatGPT Plus member take mere moments to conjure, and I imagine they\u2019ll get faster as the model continues its training. I\u2019m not entirely sure that I\u2019d use any of the speedy clips that Sora has cooked up just yet \u2014 many of them still suffer from weird artifacts like the human arms appearing on my zebras \u2014 but the clips that do make it to Sora\u2019s Featured collection give me hope that it\u2019s just a matter of learning how to ask for the right elements.\n\nI'm impressed by Sora, but I have a lot of learning to do.\n\nAlong with that, I won\u2019t be surprised if the way OpenAI handles prompts and creations opens up, too. Right now, when you burn through your 1,000 credits as a ChatGPT Plus member, that\u2019s it \u2014 there\u2019s no way to buy a few more until your billing period rolls over. Likewise, there\u2019s no way to roll unused credits from one month to the next, so you have to find the right balance of spending and saving to make it through the month.\n\nIf it were up to me, I\u2019d sure like to reclaim a few of the sillier credits I\u2019ve spent, but that\u2019s not an option. Instead, I\u2019ll call it the cost of learning, and I\u2019ll just have to take a little bit more time to fine-tune my prompts before I send them off to Sora. Maybe one day, I\u2019ll come up with something worth featuring.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

            "article_content": "Don't get me wrong -- I love the S&P 500. It's a curated stock market index comprised of around 500 of the biggest, most profitable U.S.-based businesses. With that in mind, there are always great long-term investment opportunities to be found in this pool.\n\nThat said, 500 companies is just a drop in the ocean when it comes to the stock market. There are quite literally thousands and thousands of stocks to choose from. And many outside of the S&P 500 provide life-changing gains.\n\nSo, in this article, why not broaden our focus? The Russell 2000 is another stock market index, made up of around 2,000 smaller stocks -- stocks that are valued at $10 billion or less (although there are a few outliers that are worth more).\n\nJust as there are winners to be found in the S&P 500, the Russell 2000 also produced some stocks that enriched shareholders in 2024. The quartet I've selected here -- Sezzle (SEZL 5.87%), Rigetti Computing (RGTI 17.74%), SoundHound AI (SOUN 16.44%), and The RealReal (REAL 5.23%) -- aren't necessarily the top four performers for the year. But they're all right near the top.\n\n1. Sezzle: up 1,460%\n\nSezzle is a digital financial company designed to help younger, tech-savvy consumers who don't have traditional credit cards. The stock is up by a sensational amount in 2024, thanks to impressive growth and mind-blowing improvements to profitability.\n\nConsider that in 2022, Sezzle had revenue of $126 million but had a net loss of $38 million. Revenue grew by 7% in 2023, allowing it to achieve a net income of $7 million. But this year, it expects to grow revenue by 55%, allowing it to have a net income of nearly $72 million.\n\nSezzle generates most of its revenue from charging merchants transaction processing fees. So, increasing the number of merchants that accept Sezzle payments would seem to be important, and indeed, the company regularly announces new merchants that are on board. That said, its growth is currently coming from selling subscription products.\n\nWith a Sezzle subscription product, consumers have more shopping options, among other things. The company ended 2023 with just 307,000 active subscribers, but that's jumped up to 529,000 as of the end of the third quarter of 2024. Consequently, investors should watch subscriber numbers in 2025 because they could lead to more big improvements in its financials.\n\n2. Rigetti: up 649%\n\nSince the invention of the computer, everything has operated with binary code -- a system of zeros and ones. Quantum computing intends to provide unimaginably powerful computers by progressing beyond binary code. Rigetti Computing hopes to lead the revolution.\n\nRigetti stock is up by a sensational amount in 2024, but most of the gains have happened in just the past month. Consider that quantum computing is still largely in the research-and-development phase, with a lot of money currently coming from government contracts. However, in its November report for the third quarter of 2024, Rigetti announced a big update with its product roadmap that sent the stock soaring.\n\nFor binary systems, the difference between, say, 1 bit and 2 bits is 100%. For quantum systems, however, the difference between qubits is much larger because there are more states represented. For Rigetti, it intends to release a new 36-qubit system by mid-2025 and a new 100-qubit system by the end of 2025. Those might sound small, but these represent large leaps in computational power.\n\nThere's still a lot of ground to cover before quantum computers are used regularly for commercial purposes -- Rigetti shareholders need to understand that. But for now, investors should watch to see whether the company hits its release date targets and attracts more users. Progress in these areas in 2025 is important to the long-term health of the business.\n\n3. SoundHound AI: up 539%\n\nSoundHound uses artificial intelligence (AI) to build conversational voice assistants. The technology is promising, and it's gaining traction in fast-food drive-thrus and in cars. However, few investors took notice of it before February. Then, market darling Nvidia revealed that it was a shareholder. This served as the initial catalyst that sent SoundHound stock soaring this year.\n\nAfter generating just $46 million in revenue in 2023, SoundHound's management expects to generate $150 million in revenue next year. Incredible revenue growth such as this is the central tenet of an investment thesis here. SoundHound estimates its market opportunity at $140 billion.\n\nIn other words, if its technology is truly special, then SoundHound should be able to sustain high revenue growth for years to come. It will need to do this if it's going to be a good investment. That's why shareholders should watch for key customer wins in 2025. Investors should also keep in mind that a lot of recent growth has come from acquisitions. So, it will be important to see these new businesses get integrated into the company.\n\n4. The RealReal: up 364%\n\nThe RealReal is an e-commerce platform for authenticated, pre-owned luxury goods. Much like Rigetti stock, The RealReal stock only recently skyrocketed. The company reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024 on Nov. 4. That report had investors and professional analysts rethinking their assumptions about the company.\n\nThe RealReal sells items on behalf of consignors or, in some cases, it acquires products to resell for itself. The company also generates revenue with other services, such as giving subscription buyers an early glimpse of new merchandise. The problem is that adoption has been declining and profits were nowhere close to expectations. This caused investors to lose confidence completely.\n\nNow The RealReal is returning to growth, with Q3 revenue up 11% year over year. Moreover, active buyers also modestly increased. However, the big thing was that the company generated Q3 free cash flow of $2 million. This represents only the second time it's ever reported positive quarterly free cash flow.\n\nIn short, growth and free cash flow have suddenly caused investors to feel much better about The RealReal's long-term prospects. In 2025, investors should watch to see if adoption trends keep going in the right direction.\n\nIs there a stock for investors today?\n\nAmong these four stocks, I think that Rigetti and SoundHound are the most speculative. Both are promising, but both need substantial long-term growth from here. For its part, The RealReal is still pretty cheap from a valuation perspective, which could limit some future downside. I'm unsure how big and consistent its core business can be.\n\nIf I had to buy one of these four today, I'd choose Sezzle. The adoption trends for its subscription business are impressive, and it's relatively new, giving me optimism that it can keep growing. Moreover, it's a small company with a market cap of less than $2 billion. However, with profits surging as they are, it could still be a rewarding opportunity for investors in the long term."

            "article_content": "The Hubble tension is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology.\n\nIt centers around the Hubble constant\u2014the measurement of how fast our universe is expanding\u2014which comes out as two different numbers when calculated two different ways, even though those numbers should always match.\n\nNow, the James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that this tension is real, rather than a miscalculation or a problem with our equipment. That means there\u2019s something in the underlying physics of our universe that remains a mystery.\n\nThe Hubble tension is one of the most hotly debated discrepancies in all of astronomy. It centers around a number called the Hubble constant, which is functionally the rate at which our universe is expanding. Yup, our infinite universe is expanding. Trippy.\n\nWe\u2019ve known that this expansion is a fact of our cosmos for a while now (we also know that expansion is speeding up, but that\u2019s another story). But we still don\u2019t know exactly how fast this expansion is happening\u2014we don\u2019t know what the Hubble constant is. And it\u2019s not for lack of trying, either.\n\nThere\u2019s a few ways you can measure the Hubble Constant, but there are two major ones. The first, which is how the Hubble Telescope itself does it, is to figure out how fast the things around us are moving away from us. This is done by targeting specific, reliable objects in the sky, calculating the distances to them, and combining those distance with measurements of redshift (a phenomenon that happens when an object moves away from our vantage point, stretching out the light its sending our way and making it appear redder). This is called a local measurement, and it results in a Hubble constant of around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second way is to look at the Big Bang. Well, not directly\u2014that\u2019s currently impossible. But we can look at the cosmic microwave background, which is the radiation from the Big Bang that permeates every \u2018corner\u2019 of our universe. By studying this ancient radiation, we can get a reading of what the Hubble constant would have been back when the universe began, and then use our knowledge of the laws of physics to functionally fast-forward and find what that Hubble constant should be now. Using this method, we get a predicted Hubble constant of around 68 km/s/Mpc.\n\nAnd that is the Hubble tension\u2014those numbers should be the same, but they\u2019re not. And when expectation doesn\u2019t match observation in astronomy, it means one of two things: there\u2019s something wrong with our measurement techniques, or there\u2019s something wrong with our understanding of physics.\n\nNow, more and more, it\u2019s looking like the latter. A recent paper\u2014led by Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for his discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating and, by extension, his discovery of dark energy\u2014announced that observations from the James Webb Space Telescope further confirm Hubble\u2019s measurements of the local Hubble constant. According to our absolute best space telescope, the Hubble constant is around 73 km/s/Mpc (which is within the margin of error of the original Hubble measurement), not the ~68 km/s/Mpc it should be.\n\nIt might be fair to have a little bit of a \u201cso what?\u201d reaction to this news. After all, when you boil it down, the only thing we\u2019ve discovered is that there is in fact something we still don\u2019t understand about the expansion of the universe.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the excitement behind this announcement comes from the fact that this new measurement confirms that the Hubble tension is real. It\u2019s not a quirk of an old telescope\u2014it\u2019s actually a problem. And that means this isn\u2019t some trivial squabble. There\u2019s something we don\u2019t know about the basic physics that underpin our entire cosmos.\n\nScientists are going to keep pushing to understand exactly what we\u2019re missing that is leading to this discrepancy. And if our scientific history is anything to go by, someday, they\u2019ll figure it out. And when they do, we\u2019re going to have entirely new physics on our hands. How exciting.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve has identified five species new to global science: a gecko (Hemidactylus sp.) marked by brown stripes and white nodules, the Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus), plus three plants \u2014 a globe thistle, a mignonette, and a hogbean. In addition, the Reserve recorded three species new to Saudi Arabia and extended the known global range of 34 more. These outcomes, the result of four years of fieldwork by Saudi and international experts, increase the total number of terrestrial species documented in the Reserve to 791. Although the Reserve covers only 1% of the Kingdom's terrestrial area, it is home to more than half of Saudi Arabia's terrestrial species, reinforcing its role as a vital refuge for biodiversity in a changing climate.\n\nNewly discovered gecko Hemidactylus sp, in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve\n\nAndrew Zaloumis, CEO of the Reserve, emphasized the global significance of these findings, stating: \"At a moment in time when the IUCN has warned that 28% of species globally are now at risk of extinction these discoveries are significant. They reaffirm the importance of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve as a bioclimatic refugia, particularly as climate change is increasingly impacting the customary habitats of many of these species. Testament to this is the Reserve's iconic Wadi Al-Disah, with its 200+ species, a key site on the UNESCO World Heritage Bioclimatic Refugia of Western Arabia tentative list. None of this would have been possible without the strong collaboration of natural scientists from the Kingdom and 14 other countries with the Reserve over the last 4 years to conduct multi-season field surveys.\"\n\nAmong the five species new to science are two reptiles and three plants, each with unique ecological and cultural significance. The gecko (Hemidactylus sp.), currently undergoing DNA analysis, features striking brown horizontal stripes from neck to tail and white nodules along its back. This gecko preys on small invertebrates like mosquitoes, playing an essential role in pest control within desert ecosystems. The Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus) is a small, non-venomous species that is bright red with a distinctive black collar.\n\nThe three new plants to science are firstly the globe thistle (Echinops sp. aff. glaberrimus) from the Asteraceae family. It produces vibrant blooms that support pollinators and promote ecosystem health. Historically, it has been used medicinally to treat infections and inflammations. Secondly the mignonette, (Reseda sp. aff. muricata), known for its herbal properties, is often used in teas and perfumery. And thirdly, in contrast, the hogbean (Hyoscyamus sp.) from the Nightshade family has a more complex history, having been used both as a poison and in early anesthesiology and palliative care.\n\nStory Continues"

However, people can\u2019t hibernate for a few reasons: Our bodies can\u2019t store enough fat without harming ourselves, function at such low energy and brain activity levels, or survive a massive drop in body temperature.

The latest and greatest A18 chip brings the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus duo closer to their iPhone 16 Pro counterparts than they've been in years, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max gets bigger than ever with a 6.9-inch display and the thinnest bezels of any smartphone yet.\n\nThe entire iPhone 16 family is more in harmony than ever this year, as Apple seems to have abandoned the trend of artificially limiting features like the Dynamic Island and Action Button to its Pro models, only to bring them to the standard ones a year later. Instead, this year's marquee new feature, the Camera Control, can be found on all four models. Sure, there are plenty of things that are still exclusive to the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, like the 120Hz ProMotion Display and 5x telephoto camera, but those at least feel like valid differentiators for a \"Pro\" model.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDifficulty Easy Duration 15 minutes What You Need An iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, or iPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nHowever, like all smartphones, new iPhones can come with new problems, and sometimes it takes Apple a while to work out all the bugs. The good news is that most glitches early adopters run into are software-related, which is why nearly every iOS release offers what Apple calls \"stability and performance improvements.\" While there's always a chance you got a defective iPhone 16, that's relatively uncommon. Apple's iOS is a complex piece of software, and early releases don't always play nice with the latest hardware.\n\nSo, before we get into the specific problems, it's worth mentioning that many of these may be solved in later software updates. In fact, some have already been solved in the iOS 18 point releases that are available now. We understand that some folks are reluctant to try new releases as soon as they become available for fear of encountering new bugs, but iOS point releases generally improve things. More significantly, each iOS update also typically includes important security fixes \u2014 vulnerabilities that are disclosed with that iOS update, letting every malicious hacker know how to attack iPhones running older iOS versions. This means the first thing you should do when encountering problems, no matter how small, is ensure that you've updated to the latest version of iOS 18 by opening the Settings app and selecting General > Software update. If an update is available, install it.\n\nYour touchscreen becomes unresponsive\n\nOne of the first widespread complaints we heard when new iPhone 16 units began landing in customers' hands in September were problems with unresponsive touchscreens. Theories on why this was happening ranged from problems with the new Camera Control to the slimmer bezels causing skin to come into contact with the edges of the screen when holding the iPhone and thereby triggering the touch rejection algorithm.\n\nSolutions\n\nEnsure you've updated your iPhone to the latest iOS 18 release. Apple officially fixed this in iOS 18.0.1, and we haven't heard any recent reports. However, new iPhone 16 units are likely still shipping with iOS 18.0 pre-installed, and updates won't necessarily be installed automatically.\n\nUse a case on your iPhone 16. Many folks have reported this problem doesn't occur at all with an encased iPhone. That makes sense if it's being triggered by skin contact with the edges of the screen; the best iPhone 16 cases usually have raised edges to protect the screen from impacts, but these will also help keep the edges of your palms off the display.\n\nIf all else fails, reach out to Apple Support or visit your local Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider (AASP). Although most of these issues have been addressed in software updates, unresponsive touchscreens can still be caused by hardware problems, too.\n\nYou're experiencing poor battery life\n\nIt's quite common to hear complaints of battery life after a new iPhone or major iOS release lands, and first-day upgraders are likely impacted by both, since their new iPhone 16 comes with iOS 18 \u2014 an update they may not have installed on their older iPhone. However, even if you're coming over from an iPhone 15 Pro Max running the latest version of iOS 18, you may still take a hit on battery performance for a few days.\n\nSolutions\n\nMost often this problem just requires a bit of patience. New iPhones typically have a break-in period while they're still optimizing things in the background and calibrating the battery levels. This can take anywhere from a couple of days to a week or more. You may see an even greater impact on your battery life if you're moving data over from another iPhone. Caches and indexes aren't typically backed up or transferred, so these have to be rebuilt, which takes time and consumes more power.\n\nEnsure 5G Auto is enabled in Settings > Cellular > Cellular data options > Voice & data. 5G typically consumes more power than 4G/LTE, but since it's not needed most of the time \u2014 especially when your iPhone is idle \u2014 your iPhone can manage this intelligently and only power up the 5G radios when you need the best performance.\n\nReduce your screen brightness and ensure Auto-Brightness hasn't been disabled, as this could cause your screen to run brighter than necessary, which consumes more power. This should be on by default, but you can find it in Settings > Accessibility > Display & text size to confirm.\n\nOpen Settings > Battery and check for suggestions on settings such as screen brightness and auto-lock that could be negatively impacting your battery life. You can also use the information here to see which apps have consumed the most power over the last 24 hours and last 10 days. If anything stands out here, consider using those apps less or even deleting them. If a power-hungry app shows \"Background Activity\" you can switch it off under Settings > General > Background app refresh.\n\nYour iPhone 16 reboots randomly\n\nWe've seen a few isolated reports of folks who find their iPhones randomly restarting for seemingly no reason at all. In some cases, this can happen while the iPhone is charging \u2014 wirelessly or otherwise \u2014 while others have experienced sudden restarts while using the iPhone.\n\nNote that two different things that can occur that may both seem like \"reboots.\" If your iPhone screen momentarily goes blank with a spinning progress indicator but comes back after a few seconds, that's known as a \"springboard restart,\" and involves only the user interface (e.g., the home screen and status bar). A full reboot will typically return you to the Apple logo and take a minute or two before you can use your iPhone again. You'll also be required to enter your passcode or password before you can use Face ID or Touch ID.\n\nWhile both scenarios can be equally annoying, random full reboots are often the sign of a hardware issue while springboard restarts (\"resprings\") can be caused by corrupt settings or dodgy apps. This often happens when restoring an iPhone from older backups, as cruft can travel with those backups across every iPhone you've ever owned, and sooner or later hit an iOS version that doesn't know how to deal with it.\n\nSolutions\n\nIf you're only experiencing resprings or reboots when using specific apps, check the App Store to ensure you've updated them to the latest versions and try removing and reinstalling them from the App Store. With cloud-based apps, you shouldn't risk losing any data, although you may need to sign in to the service and reconfigure your preferences. If the app stores data locally, be sure you've backed up anything you want to keep.\n\nDo a forced restart. This often helps to solve resprings by cleaning out anything deeper that could be causing problems with the high-level user interface apps like those that run the home screen and lock screen. If you're iPhone is acutally rebooting on its own, a forced restart may seem counterintuitive, but a deliberate restart flushes out data that may not be cleaned up when the iPhone abruptly reboots without taking the time to shut itself down properly.\n\nIf resprings occur across multiple apps, try resetting some of your global preferences. In the Settings app under General > Transfer or reset iPhone > Reset, you'll find options to reset various categories of settings, along with Reset all settings to take care of everything at once. None of these will remove any data, although resetting the network settings (or all settings) will clear out any saved Wi-Fi networks, so be sure you have the passwords handy for any you need to reconnect to.\n\nWiping and factory resetting your iPhone entirely can help to troubleshoot the problem, and we've encountered many cases where even restoring from the same backup causes these issues to go away. This is likely because backups only include permanent data and not caches and temporary files, both of which could contribute to the problem. Try setting it up as a new device without restoring a backup to see if the problem recurs. If it does, then you're likely dealing with a hardware issue.\n\nIf you're experiencing reboots or hangs after restoring your iPhone data from iCloud, a Mac, or a PC, then you may be dealing with a corrupted backup. If this is a new iPhone, try transferring your data directly from your old iPhone. You can also try using a different backup to see if that helps; iCloud stored the three most recent backups, so you can select an older one. If you back up to both iCloud and your computer, try restoring the other backup.\n\nCheck the system logs by going to Settings > Privacy & security > Analytics & improvements > Analytics data. You llkely won't be able to decipher most of what's here, but the key is to scroll through the list and look for entires that mention the word \"panic.\" These refer to kernel panics where the core operating system crashes entirely, and they usually indicate a hardware issue.\n\nCamera app lags or freezes\n\nWe saw a number of reports early on of folks having problems with the camera app lagging or freezing up entirely. In some cases, this happens even when performing basic actions like zooming in or taking a photo.\n\nThis problem hasn't been reported as much recently, so it's possible that Apple fixed it in an iOS 18 update or it was unique to new phones and settled down after the initial break-in period.\n\nSolutions\n\nEnsure you're running the latest iOS 18 release. Apple noted in the iOS 18.0.1 release notes that it fixed an issue where the camera would \"freeze when recording macro mode video on the Ultra Wide camera in 4K with HDR turned off on iPhone 16 Pro models.\" That's incredibly specific, but it's possible that was whatever fix was applied for that situation cleared up the broader problem.\n\nIf you're already up to date on iOS 18 and you're using a newer iPhone, wait it out. It's not uncommon to encounter performance issues while iOS is performing background optimizations.\n\nApple Pay or other NFC features not working\n\nSome folks have reported problems related to the NFC hardware on their new iPhones. While this sometimes manifests itself as problems making payments with Apple Pay, it's more commonly an issue only with reading NFC cards and tags. This includes stored payment cards like transit passes, security keys, and NFC stickers. In most cases, the iPhone refuses to acknowledge the existence of the tag entirely \u2014 nothing happens when you hold it up to the back of your iPhone, leaving you wondering if you're holding it properly.\n\nSolutions\n\nGrab a free app like NFC Tools and try using it to read your NFC security key, card, or tag. This will help you confirm if the app you're using \u2014 or the built-in iOS feature for security keys \u2014 is the problem.\n\nTry restarting your iPhone. It's a clich\u00e9, but it often works to solve problems like these.\n\nSome users have reported that toggling Airplane Mode, Cellular Data, or even AirDrop settings gets the NFC reader going again.\n\nResetting network settings also helps in some cases. You can find this in the Settings app under General > Transfer or reset iPhone > Reset > Reset network settings. Note that this will remove all saved Wi-Fi networks and passwords, so you'll have to reconnect to your Wi-FI network again after it finishes (be sure you have the password handy).\n\nIf the problem is also affecting your ability to make payments with Apple Pay then it's more likely a hardware issue or a problem with the Secure Element. We recommend reaching out to Apple Support if simple troubleshooting steps like restaring your iPhone don't resolve the issue.\n\nCamera app opening randomly\n\nSome new iPhone 16 owners have found their camera app unexpectedly popping up at inopportune times, from the middle of serious gaming sessions to sitting idle in their pockets. This can be a distraction in the first case, and a potential battery killer in the second. This is an issue we've almost never seen on older iPhone models, so the most likely culprit is the new Camera Control that Apple introduced on this year's models. While the new button has several functions, its most basic one is to open the built-in Camera app (or another camera-related app of your choice) when fully pressed.\n\nSolutions"

            "article_content": "In today\u2019s rapidly changing technology landscape, machine learning and AI enable us to redefine industries and change how we interact with the world. AI allows developers to create more intelligent, flexible, and efficient applications. Arm, due to its unique position in the industry, has been enabling AI across a variety of platforms for more than a decade.\n\nIn this article, I want to detail how Arm\u2019s technology allows developers to focus on innovation and the unique aspects of the applications they are developing while utilizing Arm\u2019s existing technology.\n\nYou don\u2019t need an NPU for AI applications For over seven years, I\u2019ve been making content about the advantages and disadvantages of different machine learning accelerators \u2014 called NPUs. These processors have their place in devices, but one myth is that you need one to run machine learning or AI tasks. That\u2019s simply not true. AI tasks don\u2019t hinge exclusively on NPUs; they can run on anything from a CPU to a GPU. With the technology found in Arm v8 and Arm v9 chips, you can run accelerated machine learning tasks particularly well on Arm CPUs.\n\nMatrix multiplication is the key mathematical operation at the heart of machine learning and AI. GPUs and NPUs are good at matrix multiplication. However, modern Arm CPUs are also good at this processing task and have hardware accelerators that enable it, too. Whether it\u2019s Arm v8 or Arm v9, Cortex-A or Cortex-X, or Arm\u2019s Neoverse processors, they all have different technologies that allow the acceleration of matrix multiplication operations.\n\nFor example, Arm\u2019s Neon technology, and Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) are both available in Arm processors, there are also 8-bit matrix-by-matrix multiplication instructions in the Arm instruction set. In smartphones and on the edge devices, Scalable Matrix Extensions (SME) are available inside Arm processors. These technologies allow the CPU to perform accelerated matrix operations without a GPU or NPU.\n\nArm\u2019s Kleidi technology\n\nArm\n\nBeyond the hardware systems, Kleidi is a central part of Arm\u2019s strategy for enabling AI on Arm-based mobile and server platforms. It covers a range of resources and partnerships for helping developers accelerate AI seamlessly on Arm, including a library of high-performance machine learning kernels called KleidiAI, which has been optimized for Arm CPUs using those various hardware accelerators.Kleidi is available on GitLab, and these kernels have been integrated into various frameworks that are ready for developers to use. As a result, we now have hardware acceleration for Arm CPUs, supporting various machine learning technologies, from classical machine learning to current generative AI.\n\nArm has integrated Kleidi technology into popular AI frameworks such as PyTorch and ExecuTorch, resulting in significant out-of-the-box performance improvements for developers. This integration ensures that developers can seamlessly leverage Arm\u2019s optimized libraries within their existing workflows, gaining up to a 12x performance improvement with minimal effort.\n\nArm partnered with Meta to ensure the recently launched Llama 3.2 model works perfectly on Arm CPUs. The availability of smaller LLMs that enable fundamental text-based generative AI workloads, such as the one billion and three billion parameter versions, is critical for enabling AI inference at scale. Arm CPUs can run larger models, such as Llama 3.2 with 11 billion parameters and even the 90 billion parameter model in the cloud. These larger models are an excellent fit for CPU-based inference workloads in the cloud that generate text and images.\n\nThe 11 billion parameter version of Llama 3.2, running on an Amazon AWS Graviton4 processor, can achieve 29.3 tokens per second during the generation phase, and that\u2019s just on the CPU. Thanks to the collaboration between Arm and Meta on the ExecuTorch framework, you can now access optimal performance by running those models on the edge. Running the new Llama 3.2 three billion LLM on an Arm-powered smartphone through the Arm CPU optimizations leads to a 5x improvement in prompt processing and a 3x improvement in token generation, achieving 19.92 tokens per second during the generation phase.\n\nIf you want a demonstration of this, check out my video above.\n\nA massive boost for developers\n\nArm\n\nThanks to these advancements, the possibilities for developers are enormous. Think of everything you could do with a large language model running on a phone using an Arm CPU \u2014 no GPU, no NPU, no cloud, just the CPU. Arm\u2019s approach is performance portability, which means that AI developers can optimize once and then deploy their models across various platforms without making any modifications. This is particularly useful for developers who need to deploy models both on the edge, in a smartphone, and in the cloud. By using Arm, developers can be sure that their model will also perform well on other platforms once optimized for one platform.\n\nArm has some great resources for developers, including documentation on how to accelerate generative AI and ML workloads when you choose to run them on Arm CPUs, in addition to running AI and ML on Android devices."

            "article_content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is in free fall, with shares tanking 12% in premarket trading on Monday. This comes hot on the heels of Friday's announcement that it's getting booted from the Nasdaq-100 Index, effective December 23. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Axon Enterprise (AXON are stepping in, replacing Super Micro, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). For Super Micro, the move caps a brutal nine months that saw its stock lose nearly 70% of its value since hitting a record $118.8 in March. The company's troubles have snowballed, from missed earnings expectations to a delayed annual report filing, auditor resignations, and a Department of Justice probe triggered by short-seller allegations.\n\nBut the hits keep coming. Bloomberg dropped another bombshell, reporting that Super Micro has hired Evercore to explore capital-raising options, including equity sales, debt financing, or private equity investments. This isn't the company's first trip down the capital-raising laneback in March, it sold 2 million new shares to drum up $2 billion. Now, with governance concerns lingering and a February deadline to file overdue reports to avoid Nasdaq delisting, Super Micro is walking a tightrope. Meanwhile, its pivot to BDO as its new auditor underscores a desperate attempt to restore credibility, but investors are clearly skeptical.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Super Micro is teetering on the edge. The Nasdaq removal is a glaring red flag, and while the potential capital raise could buy some breathing room, the company's underlying issuesgovernance gaps, financial reporting delays, and a shrinking market caparen't going away anytime soon. For investors, this might be a wait-and-watch game, but with every misstep, the odds of a turnaround get slimmer. The question now is whether Super Micro can stabilize or if it's destined to be a cautionary tale for growth stocks gone wrong.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n"

Globally, IGI holds a 33% market share for diamonds, studded jewellery, and coloured stones certifications, and 65% for laboratory-grown diamonds, positioning it as a market leader among its peers in the certification business.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, brokerages are bullish on the company\u2019s IPO. Swastika Investmart recommended subscribing to the IPO for both the short term and the long term.\n\n\u201cThe company has reported consistent growth in financial metrics, including robust results for the nine months ending September 2024. The company has a monopoly in the business as there is no listed peer for comparison. The company is also a renowned name in global merchandise. So, it is a suitable investment option for both short-term and long-term investors,\u201d Swastika said.\n\nSimilarly, Stoxbox analyst Palak Devadiga recommended a \"Subscribe\" rating for the IPO given its strong position in the segment, financial growth, and fair valuations.\n\n\u201cIGI has demonstrated substantial financial growth, with a revenue CAGR of 32.3% from CY21 to CY23. Its PAT increased significantly from \u20b91,715 million in CY21 to \u20b93,247 million in CY23, reflecting a CAGR of 37.6%. The company\u2019s strategic presence and leadership in India\u2019s laboratory network provide a competitive edge both nationally and internationally. The issue is valued at a P/E of 51.0x on the upper price band based on CY23 earnings, which is fairly valued. Therefore, we recommend a 'SUBSCRIBE' rating for this issue with a medium to long-term investment perspective,\u201d Devadiga said."

            "article_content": "Nvidia\u2019s next-gen series of GPUs is an open secret, and just a month out from CES 2025, the names and specs for these potentially massive graphics cards are out in the open. In the latest leak, a graphics OEM spoiled the names of the top five Nvidia cards, including the monstrous RTX 5090. The top-end card in the codenamed Blackwell series could take up a ton of space inside your PC. At the same time, it demands enough juice to make your next itemized electrical bill as big as the card itself.\n\nCard manufacturer Zotac leaked the SKUs for Nvidia\u2019s next slate of cards. VideoCardz picked up on the Google Search listings CSI tools before Zotac could pull the results. The screenshotted listings mention the 5090 with 32GB of GDDR7 memory at the top end, which confirms an 8GB increase from the RTX 4090\u2019s 24 GB.\n\nThese cards are big suckers. The RTX 5090 will supposedly take up three to four slots on your motherboard. The current RTX 4090 takes up three slots on most boards. That doesn\u2019t account for length, however. Nvidia\u2019s cards are also a massive power hog. The card manufacturer recommends having a PSU between 650W and 750W. Past rumors hinted the card itself could have a 600W TGP. Rumormonger Kotike7kimi, who normally has a good track record for GPU leaks, wrote on Twitter that the card may demand slightly less than the total 600W. Either way, the 5080 is somewhat more manageable, supposedly demanding 400W. The current RTX 4090 has a 450W total graphics power.\n\nThe Zotac leak showed five cards, including the GeForce RTX 5090, the RTX 5090D (a model made for Chinese markets), the RTX 5080, the RTX 5070 Ti, and the RTX 5070. If you\u2019re wondering where the 5060 or 5050 are, it\u2019s safe to assume they may not arrive at the same time as these higher-end cards. It\u2019s another matter whether Nvidia announces them at CES 2025 but later releases them.\n\nBeyond the need for a separate baby carriage inside your PC case to keep it cradled without toppling your tower, the confirmed VRAM gives more credence to past rumors that the 5090 will have 21,760 FP32 CUDA cores, more than double the number of the RTX 4090.\n\nWe\u2019d also like to hear from Nvidia itself why it decided to release the 5070 Ti \u201cTitanium\u201d edition simultaneously with its other cards. Nvidia normally drops these versions later as a sidegrade to existing GPUs, as with the 4070 Ti. Nvidia seems to be focusing on the high-end GPUs, while leaving the lower-end cards for later.\n\nFor the budget builders, it doesn\u2019t leave much room to hope the lower-end 50-series will be inexpensive. There\u2019s been much less to go on with the 5060 or supposed 5060 Ti. There have been even fewer hints about any kind of RTX 5050. Intel just released its budget cards like the B580, with claims it can top the RTX 4060 in most games, plus it comes with 12GB of VRAM. So far, rumors hint the non-Ti 5060 may have 8GB."

            "article_content": "Contributed Article\n\nThe need for speed \u2013 high-speed internet \u2013 along with greater bandwidth capacity will continue to be critical for communities everywhere in 2025 and beyond.\n\nBy: Tony Thakur, Chief Technology Officer of Great Plains Communications\n\nNetwork operators should anticipate demand for more and more bandwidth, as network traffic growth shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving all the bandwidth consumption? We rely on the internet for products, services, and applications we use continuously more and more. Smartphones, smart watches, other wearables, smart TVs, streaming services, real-time events (e.g. concert, sports), online gaming, along with virtual and augmented reality are some of the products and applications growing network traffic and consuming bandwidth.\n\nAs a fiber optic network provider, Great Plains Communications sees a continued rise in network traffic as an ongoing trend. Knowing there is a critical need for increasing bandwidth, network operators must implement best network practices in key areas to meet demand, improve productivity, and minimize disruption of customers\u2019 everyday lives.\n\nHere are key factors to support the demand.\n\nAI plus good data = best customer experience\n\nAI means different things to different groups. Transferring information between data centers for AI applications consumes high bandwidth. Yet, AI is now part of the pit crew that keeps the network running. For network operators, AI means automation to drive greater efficiency across organizations and supply bandwidth on demand.\n\nWe view AI evolving as an enabler to enhancing the customer experience. In the past, operators were reactive: a customer alerted the operator when something broke and they fixed it. Currently, most are more proactive, deploying technologies in a ring topology with redundant equipment to mitigate downtime. With AI, events can be more predictive: for example, a problem is detected and fixed before the issue can be customer affecting.\n\nThanks to AI\u2019s prediction ability, potential network disruptions can be averted. It stands to reason that a network will need more bandwidth during a live Thursday night football game. AI can calculate if the network has the necessary capacity and redundancy to ensure the audience never misses a play through buffering or other hiccups.\n\nNetwork operators must leverage AI to create a better experience for their customers. However, along with the right tools and systems, AI must leverage reliable data to make the right decisions.\n\nTimely network services\n\nWe\u2019ve come to expect real-time services like Amazon Web Services model, which is available 24/7/365. We shop online, press a button, and our purchase arrives the next day. That has become consumers\u2019 standard. So, they expect other products and services to be simpler and faster to obtain as well.\n\nPeople rely on cell phones to do almost everything, and when we pull up all the applications we\u2019re using, we\u2019re consuming more bandwidth than we realize. Hyperscalers that want more and higher bandwidth to connect their data centers are another driver of increased network traffic. At Great Plains Communications (GPC), we see more demand for 400 Gig services, especially between key markets.\n\nAs a result, network providers must become more agile, monitor services more effectively, and add more products and services that work in tandem to meet current and future customer needs. One of the biggest challenges network operators face is predicting demand and growth trends and then planning and updating networks accordingly to be ready. To accomplish this, it is vital to have flexible architecture to scale the network capacity to meet changing bandwidth requirements in metro and rural areas.\n\nData to the cloud\n\nOver the past decade, most businesses have either already done so or are planning to migrate most of their data from their own private onsite servers to cloud storage, such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and others. It\u2019s a big shift from how data used to be stored in private clouds to public clouds and a multi-cloud environment.\n\nIt is critical for businesses (and all of us) to have real-time access to data. We don\u2019t want to wait or have the data lag. The cloud data warehouses offer virtually unlimited space with the ability to compute capacity and storage to scale up and down at greater cost savings. This is a tremendous advantage, which does require more bandwidth.\n\nAs consumers, we also rely on cloud storage. After all, we can\u2019t store all our videos in our phone. We want to view a video and interact immediately. This requires reliable connectivity to the cloud, so we have immediate access to our data, wherever it\u2019s stored. Reliable connectivity \u2014 to the internet and to cloud providers \u2014 is essential.\n\nFuture runs on higher bandwidth\n\nFrom my point of view, both as a telecom network operator and as a consumer, having bandwidth infrastructure optimized to support current and future rising network traffic is a must-have. There are many considerations, but here are factors I consider essential.\n\nFirst, the network infrastructure has to deliver adequate speeds. Speed alone is not enough. We also need reliable connectivity we can trust day in and day out. This calls for careful planning and best-in-class architecture when designing the network. And, most important, we need to provide the best possible customer experience in our digital age. We should take advantage of AI and other technologies to anticipate network demands, automate processes to drive efficiencies, and provide the best possible solutions for our customers.\n\nJoin the conversation about connectivity in North America.

A unique discovery that not only teaches us more about our past, but also shows how unique the story of Roman Heerlen is for the Netherlands,\" Clemens wrote.\n\nAdvert\n\nAfter analysing the gravesite, researchers deduced that Heerlen's first settlement would have been around the Augustan era from around 0 to 20 AD.\n\nThis gravesite was discovered in the midst of excavations at Raadhuisplein, the town square in Heerlen, near a couple of historical roads in Via Belgica and Via Traiana.\n\nIt was found to be an important location in the middle of a Roman settlement named Coriovallum, according to archaeologists.\n\nCariovallum was known for its Roman bathhouse, which is also the oldest stone building in the whole country, built in approximately 40AD.\n\nAdvert\n\nNot only that, but the building also had a restaurant and library, which points towards the area being a multi-purpose building and a place of meeting in Roman times. They really were ahead of their time, weren't they?\n\nA bronze skin scraper, four plates and a bowl were found in the grave with Flaccus (Municipality of Heerlen)\n\nArchaeologists further explained that their findings would give us some new insights into the history of the city, adding: \u201cNever before have we found a Roman grave from this period with a name.\u201d\n\nAs well as Flaccus, they found a bronze skin scraper, four plates and a bowl in the grave, managing to trace the pottery back to ancient Italy, confirming their suspicions that he was a Roman soldier.\n\nAdvert\n\nIn the past, digs in the area have uncovered nothing more than pottery shreds, not proving the presence of a settlement as these items could have been left behind during travel.\n\nFlaccus' grave gave researchers eye-opening evidence that there was a Roman presence in the region, as they further explained: \u201cIt is a unique find because it is not only the oldest Roman grave in Heerlen but also because no name was known there before.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Although we are all well aware of who Jeff Bezos is, and that he's worth a few quid, not a lot of us are clued up on his family life.\n\nHis surname might have become synonymous with astronomical wealth, but it turns out that he only acquired it when he was four years old.\n\nAnd that's why his biological father, Ted Jorgensen, had no idea that his son had become one of the richest blokes in the world until 2012.\n\nAdvert\n\nTake a look at this:\n\nJorgensen was 69 years old when he opened up about discovering that he was the father of Bezos two years earlier, who at that time was in his late 40s.\n\nThe e-commerce kingpin was born in January 1964 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, while his mother Jacklyn Gise was still in high school and his dad was working as a circus performer.\n\nAdvert\n\nBut the pair divorced the following year, when the Amazon founder - then named Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen - was just 17 months old.\n\nGise went on to marry Miguel 'Mike' Bezos in April 1968, while asking Jorgensen to let her new husband adopt their son and give up custody.\n\nHe agreed, and the little boy who would later become a business magnate had his surname legally changed to Bezos.\n\nSpeaking to Inside Edition in 2014, Jorgensen recalled the last time he had ever seen his son before they completely lost contact.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"I was working in a Walmart and I remember them coming to visit me for some reason,\" he said.\n\n\"It was cold and he had his little winter coat on, and I just remember him walking down the aisle coming to see me.\"\n\nJeff Bezos pictured with Jacklyn and Miguel in 2016 (MOLLY RILEY/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFast forward to 2012, Jorgensen was left stunned when journalist Brad Stone waltzed into his bike shop in Arizona, US, to ask him a few questions.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe informed the shop owner that he had made the connection between him and Bezos while conducting research for a book detailing Amazon's rise to power.\n\nThis came as quite the shock to the former unicyclist, as he had never even heard of the world's largest online retailer and didn't use a computer.\n\nHe told Stone at the time: \"I didn't know where he [Bezos] was, if he had a good job or not, or if he was alive or dead.\"\n\nJorgensen said that over the years, he had forgotten the new surname his son had taken, hence why he had no idea about Bezos' meteoric journey to success.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe opened up about regretting not having a relationship with his son during the 2014 interview, saying he regarded it as a 'big mistake'.\n\n\"But at the time, I thought it was the best,\" Jorgensen said.\n\nReflecting on his conversation with Stone, he said: \"He asked me if I knew who Jeff Bezos was. I said, 'No, the name kind of sounds familiar, but I don't know him'.\"\n\nTed Jorgensen passed away in 2015 (YouTube/Inside Edition)\n\nJorgensen - who was battling emphysema at the time - spoke of his desire to apologise to his son for what he regarded as the biggest mistake of his life, although getting in touch with a bloke as high-profile as Bezos proved difficult.\n\n\"I would just like to tell him I used to change his diapers and just shake his hand and tell him he's really done a good job with his life,\" he said.\n\nThe bike shop owner, who was based in Phoenix, passed away in March 2015, aged 70.\n\nAccording to Page Six, he never reconnected with Bezos before he died.\n\nWhen asked about Jorgensen in 1999, the billionaire told Wired: \"The reality, as far as I'm concerned, is that my dad [Miguel Bezos] is my natural father.\n\n\"The only time I ever think about it, genuinely, is when a doctor asks me to fill out a form.\"\n\nHe previously praised his adoptive dad for moving to the US from Cuba as a teenager, saying: \"His grit, determination, and optimism are inspiring.\"\n\nBezos - who created Amazon out of his garage in Seattle in 1994 - stepped down as CEO of the company in July 2021.\n\nAccording to Forbes, his current net worth is a whopping $241.2billion."

            "article_content": "For the last month, New Jerseyans have reported odd lights in the sky at night, a rash of reported drone sightings that has attracted the attention of local residents, politicians and even President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nConcerned witnesses have described clusters of lights, saying they look like drones hovering over populated areas around the state. Now, even as sightings have expanded to New York and Maryland, government officials haven\u2019t been able to put people\u2019s minds at ease.\n\nSo who (or what) is behind the mysterious drone sightings? And can you shoot them down in California?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'This has gone too far': Drones temporarily closed runways at NY airport, governor says\n\nBecause the sightings aren't confirmed to be connected, it's possible different sightings have different explanations.\n\nFederal authorities have tried to reassure residents that the objects don\u2019t appear to be operating nefariously. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have said such sightings mostly appear to be not drones at all.\n\n\u201cHistorically, we have experienced cases of mistaken identity, where reported drones are, in fact, manned aircraft or facilities,\u201d the agencies said in a joint statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey lawmakers say they believe there is more to the story than federal officials have shared publicly.\n\nCan you shoot down drones in California? What to know after mystery NJ sightings\n\nAnd President-elect Donald Trump took to Truth Social on Friday to demand government give answers, writing: \"Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\" On Nov. 22, the FAA issued a temporary flight restriction prohibiting drones over Trump's National Golf Club Bedminster in New Jersey.\n\nOn Thursday Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., criticized the Biden administration for being \"dismissive\" about the reported sightings arguing the White House team has failed his \"obligation to the American people to figure out and tell us what is going on immediately.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lack of clear answers has fueled rampant speculation and sometimes bizarre or joking theories.\n\n\u201cThe drones in New Jersey can easily be explained. Teams are clearly spying on the Jets and Giants practices which is why they have struggled this season,\u201d former NFL kicker Lawrence Tynes said in a post on X.\n\n\u201cFirst, a Chinese spy balloon drifted across U.S. airspace for a week. Now, unidentified drones are flying over New Jersey, avoiding radar detection. Gaps in our airspace are being exploited, and because of it, the safety of Americans is at risk,\u201d New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew posted.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some possible explanations for the sightings \u2013 and the evidence for or against the theories.\n\nFor the last month, New Jerseyans have reported odd lights in the sky at night, a rash of reported drone sightings that has attracted the attention of local residents. These photos were taken on Dec. 8 in Toms River, N.J.\n\nIs it really drones?\n\nGovernment officials have said it\u2019s likely there\u2019s aren\u2019t actually drones in many of the sightings. White House National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby said many of the sightings are actually of piloted aircraft flying legally.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry Direen, an electronic and software engineering expert at DireenTech, said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if people were seeing drones at first, but that once the notion of drones took hold, people assumed any aircraft they couldn\u2019t identify was a drone.\n\n\u201cAfter what were likely valid sightings of possibly hobbyist drones, every aircraft can then become suspicious,\u201d he said.\n\nHoaxes, UFOs, witches, drones: NJ is no stranger to strange happenings\n\nKirby said during a news conference that authorities haven\u2019t been able to corroborate \u201cany of the reported visual sightings\u201d \u2014 despite using \u201cvery sophisticated electronic detection technologies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe FBI, DHS and our federal partners, in close coordination with the New Jersey State Police, continue to deploy personnel and technology to investigate this situation and confirm whether the reported drone flights are actually drones or are instead manned aircraft or otherwise inaccurate sightings,\u201d the agencies said in the statement.\n\nForeign government surveillance?\n\nU.S. government officials this week assured the public that the spotted aircraft do not appear to be sent by a foreign government, quashing a theory posed by Van Drew, who said the drones could be controlled by Iran.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence the drones pose a national security threat, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday. The sightings may actually be piloted aircraft operating legally, the agencies said. Also worth noting: the craft haven\u2019t flown in restricted airspace, they said.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, they have uncovered no such malicious activity or intent at this stage,\u201d a joint statement from the agencies said. \u201cWhile there is no known malicious activity occurring in New Jersey, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight the insufficiency of current authorities.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNew Jersey lawmakers told the Asbury Park Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, said they were briefed by State Police and told authorities don\u2019t know where the drones are coming from, and are unable to detect them.\n\n\u201cListen, I hope it\u2019s no big deal, but the federal government needs to be more truthful.\u201d New Jersey Assemblyman Greg Myhre said.\n\nUS government drones?\n\nGovernment officials including the Pentagon said the drones spotted by residents for the last few weeks are not operated by the U.S. government or military.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely that a government organization would be flying the drones over public locations, Direen said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cClearly they are not being very stealthy if they are,\u201d he said.\n\nKids playing a prank, or hobbyists?\n\nCould the drones people keep seeing be someone playing a prank, or drone hobbyists just out having a good time? It\u2019s not illegal to fly drones in New Jersey, but you have to meet certain requirements depending on the size of the drone and the reason you\u2019re flying it, according to federal and state laws.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, it should be pretty easy for officials to figure out, Direen said.\n\n\u201cIf the drones are being flown legally, the ADS-B transponder on the drone should make it easy for authorities to identify the drone and the operator,\u201d he said.\n\nUFOs?\n\nCould the drones be the work of aliens? At this point, officials have given no evidence to suggest that, but also no evidence to debunk it. (And many UFO sightings are believed to have natural explanations.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI suppose some alien kids could be flying their toy drones while their parents are busy out abducting humans and performing experiments on them,\u201d Direen said.\n\nIs it legal to shoot down a drone in California?\n\nNo. It is illegal to try to shoot down or destroy a drone that trespasses on private property or above public spaces because it may cause safety risks.\n\nAs of Oct. 1, 791,597 drones are registered in the U.S., according to the Federal Aviation Administration, including 396,746 commercial drones and 387,746 recreational drones.\n\nRegardless of the drone's classification, however, the FAA considers them aircraft \u2014 meaning that you could be charged with shooting at an aircraft, a federal crime if you take a shot at one.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf you believe a drone is violating the law, your best bet is to contact law enforcement.\n\nContributing: Anthony Robledo\n\n(This story has been updated to add new information, correct a misspelling/typo and to change or add a photo or video.)\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Mass drone sightings prompt worries, but there may be an explanation"

            "article_content": "The Hubble tension is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology.\n\nIt centers around the Hubble constant\u2014the measurement of how fast our universe is expanding\u2014which comes out as two different numbers when calculated two different ways, even though those numbers should always match.\n\nNow, the James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that this tension is real, rather than a miscalculation or a problem with our equipment. That means there\u2019s something in the underlying physics of our universe that remains a mystery.\n\nThe Hubble tension is one of the most hotly debated discrepancies in all of astronomy. It centers around a number called the Hubble constant, which is functionally the rate at which our universe is expanding. Yup, our infinite universe is expanding. Trippy.\n\nWe\u2019ve known that this expansion is a fact of our cosmos for a while now (we also know that expansion is speeding up, but that\u2019s another story). But we still don\u2019t know exactly how fast this expansion is happening\u2014we don\u2019t know what the Hubble constant is. And it\u2019s not for lack of trying, either.\n\nThere\u2019s a few ways you can measure the Hubble Constant, but there are two major ones. The first, which is how the Hubble Telescope itself does it, is to figure out how fast the things around us are moving away from us. This is done by targeting specific, reliable objects in the sky, calculating the distances to them, and combining those distance with measurements of redshift (a phenomenon that happens when an object moves away from our vantage point, stretching out the light its sending our way and making it appear redder). This is called a local measurement, and it results in a Hubble constant of around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc).\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second way is to look at the Big Bang. Well, not directly\u2014that\u2019s currently impossible. But we can look at the cosmic microwave background, which is the radiation from the Big Bang that permeates every \u2018corner\u2019 of our universe. By studying this ancient radiation, we can get a reading of what the Hubble constant would have been back when the universe began, and then use our knowledge of the laws of physics to functionally fast-forward and find what that Hubble constant should be now. Using this method, we get a predicted Hubble constant of around 68 km/s/Mpc.\n\nAnd that is the Hubble tension\u2014those numbers should be the same, but they\u2019re not. And when expectation doesn\u2019t match observation in astronomy, it means one of two things: there\u2019s something wrong with our measurement techniques, or there\u2019s something wrong with our understanding of physics.\n\nNow, more and more, it\u2019s looking like the latter. A recent paper\u2014led by Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for his discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating and, by extension, his discovery of dark energy\u2014announced that observations from the James Webb Space Telescope further confirm Hubble\u2019s measurements of the local Hubble constant. According to our absolute best space telescope, the Hubble constant is around 73 km/s/Mpc (which is within the margin of error of the original Hubble measurement), not the ~68 km/s/Mpc it should be.\n\nIt might be fair to have a little bit of a \u201cso what?\u201d reaction to this news. After all, when you boil it down, the only thing we\u2019ve discovered is that there is in fact something we still don\u2019t understand about the expansion of the universe.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the excitement behind this announcement comes from the fact that this new measurement confirms that the Hubble tension is real. It\u2019s not a quirk of an old telescope\u2014it\u2019s actually a problem. And that means this isn\u2019t some trivial squabble. There\u2019s something we don\u2019t know about the basic physics that underpin our entire cosmos.\n\nScientists are going to keep pushing to understand exactly what we\u2019re missing that is leading to this discrepancy. And if our scientific history is anything to go by, someday, they\u2019ll figure it out. And when they do, we\u2019re going to have entirely new physics on our hands. How exciting.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

            "article_content": "8. RIKEN and NTT launch world first general-purpose optical quantum computer\n\nRIKEN and NTT launched the world\u2019s first general-purpose optical quantum computer in November. The system operates at nearly room temperature and processes at speeds up to several hundred terahertz.\n\nThe computer uses continuous-variable analog design with time-division multiplexing, where computations occur through quantum teleportation. It can handle approximately 100 continuous quantity inputs. The system is accessible through a cloud service and is designed for materials science, chemistry, and AI applications.\n\nOne major benefit of this approach to quantum computing is that it operates at room temperature. By comparison, superconducting qubits and trapped ion cubits operate at temperatures close to absolute zero. According to Riken, the optical quantum computer is also faster than other quantum computing platforms.\n\n9. D-Wave speeds up processing 25,000 times\n\nAnd in yet another kind of quantum computing \u2014 the analog kind \u2014 D-Wave released the benchmark results for its latest 4,400-plus qubit Advantage2 processor in November, with big performance gains. The system solves materials science problems 25,000 times faster than its previous version, the company claims.\n\nThe new processor doubles qubit coherence time and has improved qubit connectivity, enabling solutions to larger problems.\n\nThe system delivered five times better solutions for high-precision applications and outperformed the previous version in 99% of satisfiability problem tests, the company said. It\u2019s available now through D-Wave\u2019s quantum cloud service.\n\nD-Wave\u2019s qubits can\u2019t be directly compared to those of other companies, however, because it\u2019s not a general-purpose computer but a narrow-purpose analog one.\n\n10. Google uses AI to improve error correction\n\nWe can expect to see even more progress on error correction next year. One reason? Artificial intelligence.\n\nIn late November, Google announced an AI system that spots errors in quantum computers. This uses the same transformer technology that\u2019s behind large language models and other types of generative AI, but trained specifically on quantum processes.\n\nThe system is too slow to be actually used in real-time to spot errors, Google says, but, as AI technology improves, it could point to an additional way to reduce error rates.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nSo, when will we have working quantum computers?\n\nAnalysts at the Boston Consulting Group say they\u2019ve been disappointed in the lack of recent progress of actual enterprise use cases.\n\n\u201cQuantum computing today provides no tangible advantage over classical computing in either commercial or scientific applications,\u201d Boston Consulting Group researchers wrote in a July report. \u201cThough experts agree that there are clear scientific and commercial problems for which quantum solutions will one day far surpass the classical alternative, the newer technology has yet to demonstrate this advantage at scale.\u201d\n\nAccording to the firm, our current era, that of \u201cnoisy intermediate-scale quantum\u201d will last until 2030.\n\nAt this stage, quantum computers have too few qubits and too many errors to be practically useful, but they can be used to test algorithms and do other preliminary research.\n\nBroad quantum advantage \u2014 where quantum computers can be used to solve problems that traditional computers can\u2019t handle \u2014 will last from approximately 2030 to 2040, according to the Boston Computing Group. At that time, the research firm predicts that end users will see between $80 and $170 billion in total annual value creations.\n\nIn 2040, according to the research firm, we\u2019ll enter the era of full-scale fault tolerance, and end users will see between $450 and $850 billion of value creation per year. This is when errors are reduced to the point that quantum computers can be scaled up to handle pretty much anything thrown at them.\n\nSome quantum computing companies expect to get there even faster. For example, IBM\u2019s quantum roadmap has the company delivering a fully error-corrected system in 2029. It expects to have a quantum computer with over 2,000 error-corrected qubits \u2014 or logical qubits \u2014 after 2033.\n\nIt takes many physical qubits to create one error-corrected logical qubit, so IBM expects to have a 100,000-qubit computer by then, capable of running 1 billion gates.\n\nIBM is the company to watch, says Gartner\u2019s Dekate. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that IBM is leading,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re innovating at every layer of the stack. But it is early days.\u201d Achieving workable quantum computers is a marathon, he says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the first five minutes.\u201d\n\nWhoever is ahead today might not necessarily win the race, he says. \u201cEnterprises should not fall into the trap of trying to figure out who\u2019s ahead and who\u2019s behind \u2014 that will lead enterprises to make bad decisions, because the leaderboard will change quite dramatically.\u201d\n\nHe suggests that companies looking to take the lead in finding ways to take advantage of quantum computing should partner with multiple vendors and explore different pathways. And, instead of focusing on finding short-term investment returns, they should instead think about skills development, building capabilities, investigating use cases, and preparing for disruptions."

            "article_content": "QUESTION: Why was antimony so prized by alchemists?\n\nSir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), the towering genius of the Scientific Revolution, was dubbed \u2018the last of the magicians\u2019 by John Maynard Keynes. It is often forgotten that Newton was obsessed with alchemy, having written more than a million words on the subject.\n\nAlchemy was an ancient practice that combined elements of science, philosophy and mysticism. It aimed to transform base metals like lead into noble ones such as gold, discover a universal elixir of life, and understand the fundamental nature of matter and existence.\n\nAntimony\u2019s very reactivity with usually inert elements made it fascinating to alchemists.\n\nNewton held that antimony, along with quicksilver (mercury), was the foundation of alchemy: \u2018That other (and properly named) chalybs is antimony for it is created from nature of itself (without art) and it is the beginning of the work.\u2019 (In alchemy the chalybs was a foundation chemical of \u2018the Art\u2019.)\n\nOutside its supposed alchemical properties, antimony is a chemical element belonging to the nitrogen group. It has the atomic number 51 and is a lustrous, silvery-grey semi-metal with a flaky texture. Unlike typical metals, antimony is not malleable but hard and brittle and can be crushed to a powder.\n\nA unique property of antimony is that, because its solid form is less dense than its liquid form, it expands as it freezes (like water).\n\nThe word antimony comes from the Greek anti and monos: \u2018a metal not found alone\u2019 and it can be found in more than 100 different minerals. Its chemical symbol is Sb, which comes from the element\u2019s historical Latin name, stibium.\n\nAntimony became widely used in Medieval times, mainly to harden lead, although some was taken medicinally as a laxative pill. Today about half of all antimony is used to make antimony trioxide for flame-proofing.\n\nSir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), English Mathematician And Physicist. Colored English Line And Stipple Engraving, 19th Century\n\nCharles Rees, Warwick\n\nQUESTION: What became of New Zealand\u2019s Moriori people?\n\nThe Moriori were an indigenous Polynesian people who settled the Chatham Islands, east of New Zealand, around the 14th century. They had a relatively peaceful hunter-gatherer lifestyle, relying on seal meat and seafood and adapting to the Chatham Islands\u2019 harsh and cold environment.\n\nTomorrow's questions:\n\n\n\nQ: It took 24 years for Gladiator II to be released after Gladiator. What are the longest time gaps between original feature films andtheir first sequel? John Rutherford, Sevenoaks, Kent Q: What did the Keeper of the King\u2019s Conscience do? Martine Garner, Norwich Q: Was a postbox installed in a crematorium? What was it for? Will Livesy, Truro, Cornwall Advertisement\n\nThey developed a pacifist, collectivist culture known as the law of Nunuku, based on the teachings of the 16th-century Moriori leader Nunuku-whenua.\n\nMeanwhile, the main islands of New Zealand were settled by the Maori, who developed an agricultural and warlike society, with fortified villages and organised tribal structures.\n\nIn 1835, Maori tribes from mainland New Zealand invaded the Chatham Islands, seeking new resources and territory. The Moriori, adhering to their principle of nonviolence, did not resist. They were enslaved and killed. The Moriori population fell from around 1,600 to fewer than 100 within 30 years.\n\nA Moriori survivor recalled: \u2018[They] commenced to kill us like sheep... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed.\u2019\n\nThe Moriori suffered injustice after injustice; after 30 years of slavery, the Chatham Islands were awarded to their invaders in an 1870 Native Land Court decision.\n\nThere was a systematic portrayal of Moriori as a \u2018lazy, stupid people\u2019 genetically distinct from Maori and Polynesians. This description could be found in a 1916 copy of School Journals, a series of educational magazines used across New Zealand elementary schools. The last known full-blooded Moriori, Tommy Solomon (Tame Horomona Rehe), died in 1933.\n\nEmilia Turner, London SE27\n\nQUESTION: Is Valiasr Street in Tehran the longest residential street in the world?\n\nValiasr Street, the longest in the Iranian capital (and in the Middle East), spans 11 miles from Rahahan Square in the south to Tajrish Square in the north. Built in the 1920s under Reza Shah Pahlavi, it was originally called Pahlavi Street. It was renamed Valiasr or Vali-e Asr following the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\n\nValiasr Street is the longest in the Iranian capital, Tehran (pictured) and it spans 11 miles from Rahahan Square in the south to Tajrish Square in the north\n\nYonge Street in Toronto, Canada, is the longest street in the world. Measuring 34 miles, it connects Lake Ontario in the south to Lake Simcoe in the north.\n\nThe longest street in Britain is disputed, with both Duke Street in Glasgow and King Street in Aberdeen commonly claiming to be two miles long.\n\nSteven Lewis, Coventry"
