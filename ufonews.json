        "article_content": "As Earthlings, we\u2019re curious about whether alien civilizations like ours are out there or if they exist at all\u2014which is why scientists were intrigued when a mysterious shard of metal exhibited signs that it might have come from intelligent minds on a distant planet.\n\nThis peculiar specimen fell to Earth around 1947 in a supposed UFO wreck that seemed linked to the infamous Roswell incident, which had members of the general public believing a flying saucer had crashed to Earth. It turned out that the debris found in Roswell was actually from a U.S. Air Force balloon meant to spy on Soviet nuclear experiments.\n\nThe true origins of the metallic specimen were debated for decades. Eventually, Blink-182 frontman and UFO enthusiast Tom DeLonge\u2019s To the Stars Academy got a hold of it. The organization independently researches possible alien phenomena, and the sample had an apparently unprecedented material structure that could indicate an extraterrestrial technosignature. Then, the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) for the U.S. government, took over the investigation to learn more about the object\u2019s physical and chemical properties that made it potentially capable of inertial mass reduction\u2014levitation.\n\nThe object in question is a magnesium alloy whose main components are magnesium and zinc. It also contains bismuth, lead, and other trace elements.\n\nAARO asked Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to conduct an analysis in 2022 because scientists were especially interested in whether the sample was of terrestrial origin and if its bismuth content meant it could have possibly been used by aliens as a terahertz waveguide, a metal object that directs electromagnetic waves emitted by an energy source. ORNL was originally established during WWII to investigate things such as atomic weapons, and most of what its scientists investigate is still energy-related. However, the lab has also studied materials suspected to be extraterrestrial. This metal shard specimen \u201cpurportedly exhibits extraordinary properties,\u201d according to AARO and ORNL\u2019s recently published findings on the object.\n\nORNL scientists looked for evidence of life beyond our planet by studying the sample for possible biosignatures , which are naturally occurring substances associated with life, and technosignatures , which are signs of extraterrestrial technology that scientists especially seek out when searching for intelligent life. Some UAPs might have both.\n\nIn looking for alien biosignatures, ORNL scientists wanted to see whether the isotopes of the metals in this alloy were from Earth. Finding out where the metals originated meant investigating their isotopic signatures. These represent the ratios of different element isotopes in a material (when versions of the same element exist, but each has a different atomic mass.) Analysis showed that the isotopic signatures of magnesium and lead indicated a terrestrial origin. The magnesium\u2019s isotopic signature had undergone some fractionation, or separation of lighter and heavier isotopes, probably due to stress from heat and physical or chemical manufacturing processes. However, it was still within the normal range for magnesium that forms on Earth, not an alien biosignature.\n\nStrengthening the case for a local origin, the magnesium in this sample also showed a proportion of isotopes that occurs only in our solar system. Scientists know this because the isotopic signature of magnesium originally comes from a particular star-forming region and so is unique to each star system. Magnesium is an extremely common element in the universe, produced in great amounts by larger, older stars that scatter it into space when they die and go supernova. It is often recycled by young star systems, where it forms a unique isotopic signature, depending on the conditions.\n\nMoving on, the lead in the object also matched the isotopic signatures for lead that originates on Earth. These signatures are so distinct that there is no way they could have come from any other body\u2014even the moon.\n\nWith no alien biosignatures present in the sample, the ORNL scientists turned their attention to technosignatures. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed that the crystalline structure of the magnesium was similar to the magnesium in alloys manufactured on Earth. With that confirmed, they tried to determine if the sample could have been part of a terahertz waveguide.\n\nWaveguides are metal objects that transmit electromagnetic waves. For example, the magnetron in your microwave oven transmits waves to the main oven cavity, where they heat up leftovers. A terahertz waveguide levels up this technology with much more intense terahertz waves, hypothetically enough to levitate an object if built using the right methods and materials.\n\n\u201cBased on the technologies developed by humans, waveguides can only channel radiation for purposes of communication, data collection, or heating but the conjecture for the UAP was that they were used for levitation,\u201d says Harvard University theoretical physicist Avi Loeb, Ph.D., who was not involved in the study. \u201cThat would represent a technology unknown to humans.\u201d\n\nTo qualify as a piece of alien technology, the sample would need to have a single layer of pure bismuth between layers of the magnesium alloy. This is because unadulterated bismuth can guide energy just like the magnetron in your microwave. Unlike anything in your microwave, bismuth is capable of directing terahertz waves. The problem is that the bismuth in this sample is neither pure nor in a single layer. There are multiple layers of bismuth between the magnesium layers, and the bismuth itself contains lead, both of which would disrupt its functioning as a waveguide.\n\n\u201cORNL has a high level of confidence that all data indicate the material was manufactured terrestrially\u2014albeit using an uncommon mixture of elements by today\u2019s standards\u2014and then incurred damage caused by mechanical and heat stressors,\u201d according to the report .\n\nAfter seeing the analysis, To the Stars released a statement on its website, anticipating a meeting between its own scientists and the ORNL team. In particular, To the Stars is hoping to learn more because \u201cthe reports do not offer a firm conclusion as to the origin and purpose of the material along with other seeming anomalies. [To the Stars] has more questions about both reports.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile we still don\u2019t know exactly where on Earth the mysterious sample came from, all indications show that it belongs to our own planet. There is a likely origin story behind this object\u2014it might be a product of post-WWII magnesium alloy research for lighter and stronger aircraft. Back then, magnesium alloys were poorly understood, according to the report.\n\nMaybe this artifact wasn\u2019t part of a larger piece of technology manufactured by alien hands, or whatever appendages and machines they might use. Still, this was a valuable exercise, because ruling out objects that originated on Earth only gives us a better idea of what really could be extraterrestrial."

        "article_content": "UFO 50 review\n\nThe 1980s reimagined as a collection of 50 \"small\" games, ranging from arcade racers to full-blown RPGs. Developer: Derek Yu, Jon Perry, Eirik Suhrke, Paul Hubans, Ojiro Fumoto, Tyriq Plummer\n\nDerek Yu, Jon Perry, Eirik Suhrke, Paul Hubans, Ojiro Fumoto, Tyriq Plummer Publisher: Mossmouth\n\nMossmouth Release: Sept 18th 2024\n\nSept 18th 2024 On: Windows\n\nWindows From: Epic Games, Steam\n\nEpic Games, Steam Price: \u00a3TBA/$TBA/\u20acTBA\n\n\u00a3TBA/$TBA/\u20acTBA Reviewed on: Intel Core-i7-11700F, 16GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, Windows 10\n\nYou can't travel back to the 1980s. But what if I told you it was possible to gently warp your memories of that time? UFO 50 is a kart of 50 games that once existed for an old computer system, all lovingly restored by a gang of coders. The old console, of course, is a fiction. The LX-I never existed. But it's a fun pseudo-history against which to create a grab bag of small games (some throwaway, others mighty) all designed with a distinct 80s look. It's an exercise in adhering to an aesthetic. Like an oil painter working with a limited range of colours, the developers of this bundle have stuck to a 32-bit equivalent of the Zorn palette. Yet play a little of each game, and you start to sense the smirk of chronos. These games aren't stuck in the past, but they are enjoying a holiday there.\n\nIt's also a funny collection, full of jokes and pranks at the player's expense. In one adventure game, tiles may fall on you without warning within seconds of your first movements. In a puzzle game about a chameleon, birds will slurp you up from inside logs just when you thought you understood the rules of camouflage. One medieval strategy game sees your units advance steadily and automatically forward, desperate to charge, unable to even think of defending. This game is called \"Attactics\"; the title alone a good gag.\n\nThere's also comedy (and satisfaction) in discovering exactly what each of these things is. Barbuta, the \"oldest\" game in the collection, is an unassuming and ancient homebrew Metroidvania that houses glitchy secrets and requires the patience and dedication of a child indoors on a rainy day to make progress. Rail Heist looks like a Sunset Riders-style shooter, but then invites you to play it as an Atari-era Hotline Miami, before you finally realise: \"Hang on, is this... an immersive sim!?\"\n\nVery few of the games give you any instructions, electing instead to just drop you in. It's a common complaint that modern games hold your hand too much, that they over-tutorialise, and fail to trust the player's perseverance or intelligence. So it's refreshing to get 50 games (albeit of varying depth) which implicitly trust the player to \"figure it out\". If your patience or brainpower does run out (and mine did a few times) you can simply eject the cartridge and play something else.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nTo take an example of one of the more compelling oddities, Mooncat is an comically obtuse platformer with some of the most counter-intuitive controls you will encounter this side of 1985. But if you stop and \"zoom out\" of your preconceived notions of what a controller's inputs ought to do, the idea behind it sort of makes sense. All the direction buttons move you left, and all the face buttons move right. Hey, why not? These are games diegetically invented four decades ago, and it's fun to read Mooncat as the product of a time long before each genre's control schemes developed any sense of orthodoxy.\n\nThe whole collection exists in this realm of tension, stretched out like a 40-year-long rubber band. If you squint, you can recognise the games of today between the pixels. Zoldath is a randomly generated explore 'em up set on an alien world where your tools are fuelled by mineral and plant pickups. In other words, it's No Man's Sky but in 1984. Meanwhile, the grid-based laser zappin' of Bug Hunter feels like an NES demake of Into The Breach (and is surprisingly moreish as a result). Velgress is a popcorn platformer that propels you ever higher through fear of decaying platforms. It is like Downwell but going up. That checks out. After all, the designer of Downwell is on the team of (real) developers who made the collection.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\n\"Our goal,\" say this gang, \"is to combine a familiar 8-bit aesthetic with new ideas and modern game design.\" In this I'd say they succeed. Many of the games are built on design principles or novel gimmicks that simply wouldn't appear in the shooters and platformers of yore, and it's interesting to see where the creators draw a line in terms of what constitutes modern and \"classic\" game design. (They also inadvertantly make a compilation of games that fit the aesthetics of the \"indie darlings\" era of the 2010s, but probably because, uh, they are those darlings).\n\nThe modern twists are noticeable. Take the concept of \"lives\" for example. Mortal is a platformer in which you are given a generous 20 lives. But then you are expected to spend those lives turning yourself to stone blocks, or repeatedly launching yourself at the wall to create a step-ladder out of your rigid corpses, thus helping your next \"life\" get further into the level. Other modern ideas trickle into the games. You can hold down a button to skip long cinematics, for instance. And at least one game ranks you on a three-star scale at the end of every level, adapting the contemporary practice of mobile games.\n\nAgainst the aesthetics of a pixelated era, such features feel alien, yet weirdly compelling. Imagine watching Humphrey Bogart send a telegram in a 1950s noir, and then text starts appearing on-screen in a WhatsApp speech bubble. Imagine you are enjoying an Akira Kurosawa flick, and suddenly: an unmistakable drone shot. That's what playing UFO 50 is like. It's a compilation of double-takes, a comic provoker of \"huh\"s, an anachronism bonanza.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nIt works well mostly because it is so committed to the framing narrative: that this collection exists as a restoration project. There is a meta story (or maybe a \"meta-history\") to unravel, if you look closely. Each game has its own short developer note. And there's a terminal to enter cheat codes that I suspect will reveal some fun secrets (I didn't crack a single code). Taking it all in at once, the compilation is the story of a hobby's slow professionalisation. Even the menu screens of each game, when taken in chronological order and analysed like individual layers of polar ice, track the changes of their creative pioneers.\n\nEarly games are credited in plain text, made by a trio called \"Petter, Chun & Smolski\". Later games see personal names replaced by a business, \"LX Systems\", and then \"UFO Soft\". Eventually the games start sporting a professionally animated logo, complete with a pretty jingle. All personal calling cards are smoothed away. The enigmatic figure of a developer called Thorson Petter appears in early works, creator of games that are often painful or confounding to play, yet strangely sincere in their own user-agnostic way (guess who made Barbuta and Mooncat). Later, his name seems to disappear.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nOf course, you don't need to engage in any of this. You can just find the 25 games that include local multiplayer and go ballistic with a pal. There is built-in curation too, letting you filter the games broadly by genre. \"Quick play\" and \"reflex play\" cover some arcadey bops, while \"thinky games\" offers up all the puzzles. And even within these filters there exists a little surprise, a special screen for collectors and obsessives. Perhaps this is the time to say that if you subscribe to Retro Gamer and find yourself watching endless YouTube documentaries about the good old days of pixel platforming, then this will undoubtedly tickle you. It also feels purpose-built for students of game design. Any day now UFO 50 will appear in a video by Mark Brown, and people will wonder why they haven't heard of it (it's because you don't read RPS, you rubes!). Ahem.\n\nIf you're not that kind of person - not a retro freak or a game designer yourself - then it's a harder sell. There are games with deceptive depth, engaging enough to grab you by the \"one more turn\" glands. But you'll have to go in knowing that part of the fun is sifting through the pile to find those. I would flip through three or four games about angry football or samurai tennis with lazy channel-surfing curiosity, only for an hour to vanish like Batman on a nerdy dinosaur-worshipping worker placement game (it's called Avianos, it rules). This is part of the schtick. UFO 50 is not just about playing a bunch of small, tightly made games, it's also about chasing the buzz of discovering something that stands out.\n\nImage credit: Rock Paper Shotgun / Mossmouth\n\nAs someone who has spent years curating games to an audience, I'm conflicted about that. It feels a bit like work. I used to trawl through itch.io every week for a free games column on this very site. I understand both the satisfaction and disinterest that comes from panning for gold dust, even in today's overwhelming gamepocalypse. It's definitely gratifying to rummage through UFO 50 and find an Avianos, a Velgress, a Mortal in the pile. But I also didn't get through all 50 of the games in the collection. I barely scratched half. I don't think I could face mining the entire bundle. (Fun side note: this isn't the first time we've been at the coal face with 50 short games, or even 300 in a pirate kart).\n\nMaybe an unfinished pile is to be expected, though. The internet is a capable devourer, and I look forward to reading user reviews about UFO 50 in a way I don't for many other recent releases. Players will be able to evangelize their favourites, list their unmissables, and get into role-playing flame wars about which game in the Campanella Trilogy was best. Perhaps someone out there will explain why you should not give up on the opaque works of Thorson Petter. That would be swell. I don't want to complete Mooncat, that baffling platformer, but I do want to watch the 20-minute retrospective from the bearded 50-year-old who has."

        "article_content": "Efforts to preserve, spotlight, and celebrate important games of the past have been gaining steam in recent years. Consider, for instance, Digital Eclipse\u2019s Atari 50, a compilation of games from across that company\u2019s history that provides wonderful context in the form of interviews and archival materials, illuminating their colossal impact on gaming. Now, we have another such compilation: UF0 50, a collection of 50 games from UFO Soft, the business-software-maker-turned-game-developer that, across the 1980s, was responsible for dozens of gems which simultaneously reflected the larger gaming trends of the time, while also innovating and pushing the medium forward in their own right. There\u2019s just one small but crucial detail here, however, that sets UFO 50 apart from any other such compilations: UFO Soft never actually existed.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s right, UFO 50 is, for lack of a better term, a \u201cfictional\u201d game compilation, though the games are very real. Here, in their entirety, are 50 games\u2013not minigames, mind you, not little playable demos, but full-length, complete gaming experiences\u2013from a company that never existed. Developers Derek Yu (Spelunky), Jon Perry (Air Land & Sea), and musician Eirik Suhrke (Hotline Miami) spearheaded the project, but they and the other devs actually responsible for the games here are fully committed to the bit. If you beat a game here, it\u2019s the fictional devs of UFO Soft whose names you\u2019ll see on the staff roll. Instead, Yu and the others responsible are listed in the compilation\u2019s opening as \u201cthe UFO 50 Recovery Team.\u201d In this sequence, we see them digging an old gaming computer out of someone\u2019s storage unit and beginning the process of recovering these games for preservation in this collection. \u201cWhenever possible,\u201d we are told, \u201cthe integrity of the original software was preserved.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlaying UFO 50 feels something like being dropped off at your grandparents\u2019 house as a kid and finding that they have an old console you\u2019ve never heard of and a library of games you know nothing about.\n\nThe 50 games here present a picture of a company that, in 1982, took its tentative first step into game development with the challenging and mysterious adventure game, Barbuta (\u201cDeveloped secretly on company time, it almost got Thorson Petter fired,\u201d an in-game factoid tells us), and that, by 1989, was producing games like the vibrant, multi-genre Cyber Owls, \u201claunched alongside an original comic book series.\u201d At every step, UFO Soft was both responding to current gaming trends and establishing its own identity, producing games that tried to capitalize on popular new genres and tendencies in game design while also bearing their own distinctive authorship.\n\n\n\nAnd this, in my view, is essential to what makes UFO 50 so fascinating. Often, modern retro games wear their references a little too proudly, containing winking references to games of the past as if to say to you, \u201cWe know you like Classic Game X! We like Classic Game X, too! See, we\u2019re doing that thing you liked back when that game did it!\u201d There\u2019s none of that here in UFO 50. This game believably creates a kind of pocket dimension in which UFO Soft actually existed, creating games that capitalize on the rapidly improving game hardware of the 1980s but that aren\u2019t beholden to what everyone else was doing.\n\n\n\nBarbuta, for instance, feels roughly on par with something you might see on the MSX in the early 80s, while Cyber Owls feels akin to an elaborate blockbuster that might have arrived on the NES in 1989, when developers were figuring out how to make the most of that console\u2019s power. (Similarly, it doesn\u2019t cheat with trends or genres, either. UFO Soft makes a beat-em-up, for instance, but not before beat-em-ups exist.) But this isn\u2019t, thank goodness, a compilation in which you\u2019ll find one-to-one clones of the era\u2019s hits. There isn\u2019t UFO Soft\u2019s take on Super Mario Bros. here, though you\u2019ll certainly see elements from games you know and love, which makes it feel as if UFO Soft was around at that time and in conversation with what the rest of the game development landscape was doing. Sometimes I\u2019d dive into a game and say, \u201cOh, cool, this feels like it\u2019s riffing on Blaster Master,\u201d or \u201cOkay, I can definitely see elements of Space Taxi here,\u201d but these games also always felt distinctive, as if made by people with their own ideas, who wanted to make their own contribution to the medium.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo give you a quick sense of the breadth of what\u2019s on offer here, I\u2019m going to highlight five of the games that have stood out to me most in my time with UFO 50. (Remember, there are 50 games here. I\u2019ve played about ten hours of UFO 50 in all, so to say that I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of what\u2019s available here is an understatement.) The one that\u2019s grabbed me the most right out of the gate is Valbrace, a tough action-RPG released, the game\u2019s fiction would have it, in 1988. I haven\u2019t made it very far yet, but its fusion of twitchy combat and first-person dungeon crawling is immediately appealing, and I\u2019m determined to level up my intrepid adventurer and find out what awaits in the dungeon\u2019s lower levels. It also reminded me of how, in the 1980s, it was always exciting if I equipped some new weapon or armor on a game character and their sprite changed. It\u2019s a little thing but it went a long way toward making the visuals feel more immersive and responsive to me as a player. Valbrace has that, and I felt that same little thrill I felt as a kid when I spotted it for the first time.\n\n\n\nNext, there\u2019s Rail Heist, a fascinating hybrid of real-time and turn-based gameplay with destructible environments in which each stage is a kind of puzzle. Playing as a member of a train-robbing crew in the Old West, you must figure out how to get the money on the locomotive out from under the noses of the lawmen guarding it. It\u2019s simultaneously strategic and kinetic, a real blast.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttactics is a fast-paced real-time tactics game for people like me who often avoid tactics games. Units from two opposing castles march toward each other automatically, but you can frantically grab your own units and slide them into advantageous formations to better withstand and conquer the enemy onslaught.\n\n\n\nPorgy is a gorgeous undersea adventure in which you pilot an adorable little submarine (with eyes!) to find upgrades and solve a mystery. The world is filled with both dangers (giant shark attacks!) and secrets just waiting to be discovered.\n\nFinally, the aforementioned Cyber Owls is a fitting game to close out UFO 50\u2019s chronology. Ostensibly released in 1989 and the \u201cfinal\u201d game in this compilation, Cyber Owls shows the developers at UFO Soft pulling out all the stops to make an elaborate multi-genre hit. The rogue commando group H.A.W.K. has acquired a doomsday weapon, putting the whole world in danger, and naturally, the president calls upon the only heroes who are up to the task of thwarting their deadly plans: the Cyber Owls. Each of the four missions your cadre of elite avian agents must undertake is wholly distinct: one\u2019s a beat-em-up, one\u2019s a Cabal-style shooter, one\u2019s a Metal Gear-esque stealth mission, and one\u2019s a side-scrolling vehicular shmup. What really makes it all work for me, though, is the way that it actually feels like it\u2019s based on a Saturday morning cartoon or comic book. As you progress, you encounter an assortment of villains who easily could have belonged to the rogue\u2019s gallery on a show that fused Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with G.I. Joe, and it feels like the devs gave some real thought to fleshing out this fictional late-80s IP.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd yet, that very brief overview of five of the included games here\u2013just one tenth of the entire library\u2013is wholly inadequate at trying to convey the experience of actually playing UFO 50. For one, there are so many other types of experiences here. There\u2019s a game with Smash T.V.-style arena shooting. There\u2019s a first-person horror adventure game that plays similarly to Shadowgate or Deja Vu. There\u2019s a Japanese-style RPG set in a Wild West world. There\u2019s a strategic deckbuilder of sorts in which you try to have the right assortment of people in your Rolodex to ensure your parties are a rousing success. There\u2019s a wonderfully strange puzzle platformer in which you deliberately sacrifice your character\u2019s lives to create a path for the lives that follow. And so much more. The real point of UFO 50, if it can be said to have one, lies not in any individual game, as great as some of them are, but in the variety and richness of what they offer when collected here.\n\n\n\nPlaying UFO 50 feels something like being dropped off at your grandparents\u2019 house as a kid and finding that they have an old console you\u2019ve never heard of and a library of games you know nothing about. You\u2019re probably not going to love all of them, but that\u2019s actually good, I would argue. UFO 50 would probably be a much safer and more limited collection if it felt calibrated for maximum mainstream appeal; part of what makes it so great is that, while a number of games here may not quite click with you, they will all probably really click with someone, in a way games only can when they take chances and feel like the work of individuals rather than a committee. There\u2019s joy and excitement in the act of exploration and discovery, in encountering something inscrutable and pushing up against it until it starts to click for you. (Pro tip: If you find a game particularly hard to penetrate, just let it sit on the title screen for a minute. There\u2019s a chance that, like many actual games of the era, it will start a demo sequence that at least offers some clue as to how to approach it.)\n\n\n\nAnd while some of these games might have been minor hits today on Steam if they were released independently, UFO 50 is so much more than the sum of its parts. Hopping around from game to game here, playing them alongside each other and in the context of each other, what emerges is not just a collection of fun, inventive, and incredibly varied games that could have been made in the 1980s, but weren\u2019t. This is an ode to innovation and game design itself, a celebration of those visionaries who, in gaming\u2019s early days, had fresh, original ideas and pushed a burgeoning art form to its limits in order to realize them. This is a tribute to the people behind one of the most exciting eras in game history, a time when new genres and new concepts were appearing all the time. And, in that way, it also feels to me like a statement about what matters most in game design. It\u2019s not the biggest budgets or the most polish. It\u2019s creativity and experimentation, a willingness to try new things and keep pushing a young medium forward. With any luck, we\u2019re just getting started.\n\n\n\n."

Here, all can be played using a few strokes of the keyboard.\n\nThere\u2019s a potent faux history that we\u2019re looking back at the standouts from UFO Soft, a fictional game company that was \u201cobscure but ahead of its time.\u201d Packed in are so many completely different genres that choosing one is like opening a door to an ingenious Advent calendar."

        "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nBack on August 4, 1990, two men were northwest of Perth in Calvine, just on the edge of Scotland\u2019s Cairngorms National Park, when they snapped a photo of a UFO that became known as the \u201cCalvine Photograph.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cCalvine Photograph\u201d has gone on to be called by some, the most spectacular UFO picture ever captured.\n\nThe photos the men took were turned over to Scotland\u2019s Daily Record newspaper who then gave them to Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defense (MoD).\n\nFor over 30 years, the infamous UFO photos were never published and never made them available to the public, and were considered to be lost until 2023.\n\nAndrew Robinson, a senior lecturer in photography at Sheffield Hallam University, who examined the \u201cCalvine Photograph,\u201d said after examining it last year, \u201cMy conclusion is that the object is definitely in front of the camera, that is, it\u2019s not a fake produced in post-production, and its placement within the scene appears to be approximately halfway between the foreground fence and the plane in the background.\u201d\n\nNo one, however, has ever been able to discern exactly what the UFO in the photographs actually was. At least not until now. Maybe.\n\n\u201cLuckily I have recently had access to retired CID Officer John Hanson\u2019s UFO archive in Stratford Upon Avon. It\u2019s a treasure trove of UFO sightings going back to the 1940\u2019s,\u201d said UFO researcher and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee.\n\n\u201cFrom going through all these documents there seems to have been a lot of sightings of diamond shaped crafts since the 1970\u2019s and especially around UK military bases.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a connection \u2013 is the Calvine UFO a secret military technology either of ours or an adversary that has been kept secret? Why is this diamond shaped craft seemingly accompanied by military jets?\u201d\n\nAnother researcher who has inspected the photos, Mike Bara, offers a slightly different take.\n\n\u201cWhat you are looking at here is not a flying UFO, but something else,\u201d Bara recently stated. \u201cThe Calvine UFO lines up with the mountain in the background perfectly. So what happened?\n\n\u201cI think it is pretty obvious what happened. There was an inverted cloud layer here, fog, down on the ground in the valley, probably right up to the fence and they took a picture of the Harrier Jet, which was streaking around for whatever reason, maybe doing exercises, and the peak of this background mountain was sticking through the clouds, probably at about 2,500 feet.\n\n\u201cTwo guys took a picture of a Harrier and then realized there looked like there was a UFO and probably thought why don\u2019t we turn it into the press to maybe get some money. The Calvine UFO is not a UFO, it is not a flying object. I understand that for some people this is going to be hard to take but you have to go where the evidence goes. We can say the Calvine UFO mystery is solved.\u201d\n\nBut has it really been solved?\n\nThe two men who took the Calvine photographs have never been identified and the MoD suspiciously says they won\u2019t be revealing their names anytime before the year 2076, citing \u201cprivacy concerns.\u201d Why?"

Read preview\n\nThe talent-management agency Dulcedo Group acquired the influencer-marketing app Node in a July deal that valued the company at around $13 million, Node's cofounders told Business Insider.\n\nNode is a mobile app that matches small businesses with micro and nano influencers for sponsored content opportunities. The company has worked with around 2,000 businesses across a roster of around 10,000 creators who post promotional content in exchange for gifted products, free in-person experiences, or cash. Cofounders Armin Faraji and Mackenzie D\u00e9rival launched the app in 2019. Node raised around a million dollars from angel investors and firms like Techstars and startup accelerator Alchemist, Faraji said.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe deal shows how important tech products, including artificial-intelligence tools, have become in the talent and marketing industries. M&A deals in the category have been bustling over the past 12 months as traditional ad agencies like Publicis Groupe and Stagwell have similarly added influencer startups to their company portfolios. Stagwell specifically called out Leaders' AI tech in its announcement around the deal.\n\nFounded in 2008 as an agency for more traditional media talent, Montreal-based Dulcedo Group has recently been on a buying spree, announcing in November it acquired creator talent agency Influence+All and PR firm Sundae Creative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNode began looking for a buyer in 2023 after it needed cash and ran into a challenging fundraising environment. It shrunk its company headcount to four staffers and hoped that joining a larger agency could help it win deals with bigger brands.\n\n\"We realized that agencies are the gatekeepers,\" D\u00e9rival said. \"We would rather join them and help them with technology and that would help us with monetization and provide value for our investors.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe cofounders ultimately connected with Dulcedo Group, which put in an offer to acquire Node. Dulcedo Group was drawn to the company's technological expertise and roster of micro influencers, Faraji told BI.\n\n\"A lot of agencies are actually acquiring technology from a defensive position,\" Faraji said. \"They're doing it because they are either losing customers to an influencer platform that's a tech startup, or their customers are coming to them and saying, 'Hey, do you guys have any technology? The way you're collecting data or the way that you're running these campaigns is inefficient,'\" he said. \"What drew us towards Dulcedo is that they're actually making acquisitions so that they can be offensive, not defensive. It's not just about protecting market share with them, it's about expanding market share and also addressing new customer segments within the creator economy.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne area of focus for Node post-acquisition is AI. The company said it's developing AI tools to improve social listening and data analysis, and streamlining the process of identifying new talent to work with.\n\n\"AI automates the manual labor when it comes to influencer marketing,\" Faraji said. \"At the end of the day, relationships still rule the industry. Agencies will work with creators that they have relationships with, and creators will make compromises to work with agencies and brands that they love.\""

        "article_content": "Microsoft is unveiling new features in its $30 per user Microsoft 365 Copilot monthly subscriptions that are designed to improve AI integration inside of Office apps. Excel is getting Python integration inside of Copilot, PowerPoint has an improved AI-powered narrative builder, Word is getting better at AI-assisted drafts, and Copilot will be able to help you organize your Outlook inbox, too.\n\nAfter bringing Python to Excel last year, Microsoft is now combining its Python support with Copilot to let Excel users easily perform advanced analysis on spreadsheet data. \u201cNow, anyone can work with Copilot to conduct advanced analysis like forecasting, risk analysis, machine learning, and visualizing complex data \u2014 all using natural language, no coding required,\u201d says Jared Spataro, corporate vice president of AI at work at Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s like adding a skilled data analyst to the team.\u201d\n\nThe Copilot and Python integration inside of Excel enters public preview today, just as Microsoft makes Copilot in Excel generally available to its Microsoft 365 Copilot subscribers. Microsoft has also added Copilot support for XLOOKUP and SUMIF, conditional formatting, and the ability for the AI assistant to produce more charts and PivotTables.\n\nCopilot in PowerPoint is also getting improvements, with an improved narrative builder that\u2019s designed to let you quickly create a first draft of a slide deck. The AI assistant will even soon use a company\u2019s branded template to create drafts or company-approved images from SharePoint libraries.\n\nCopilot in Microsoft Teams will summarize conversations that happened in the text chat as well as spoken ones in meetings later this month. This will help meeting organizers make sure they didn\u2019t miss any unanswered questions that were typed into the chat. \u201cOur customers tell us Copilot in Teams has changed meetings forever \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the number one place they\u2019re seeing value,\u201d says Spataro.\n\nCopilot is getting more useful inside of Outlook inboxes. Image: Microsoft\n\nI\u2019ve personally been waiting for improvements to Copilot in Outlook beyond drafting and summaries, and now Microsoft is starting to allow its AI assistant to organize your inbox. A new \u201cprioritize my inbox\u201d feature lets Copilot automatically prioritize emails. Later this year, you\u2019ll also be able to \u201cteach Copilot the specific topics, keywords, or people that are important to you,\u201d according to Spataro. These emails will then also be marked as high priority in your inbox.\n\nLater this month, Microsoft is also improving Copilot in Word to let you reference data from emails and meetings, alongside data from documents. This will make it easier to bring in attachments from emails or entire talking points from meetings. Microsoft is also rolling out Copilot in OneDrive later this month, making it easy to summarize and compare up to five files to spot differences between them.\n\nOneDrive\u2019s file comparison tool. Image: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s improvements to Copilot in Office are designed to make the AI assistant more enticing to businesses, alongside a new Copilot Pages feature and AI agents that will automate certain tasks. Recent reports have suggested there has been a lukewarm reception to Microsoft\u2019s paid Copilot version for businesses, due to bugs and a reluctance to pay the $30 per user price."

The move happened shortly after a curious incident with her father in which he was unresponsive or frozen in time for several minutes while reading the newspaper one Sunday morning.\n\nHewins said her father told the family that they had to move to Bridgewater \u201cbecause God told him to.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Hewins described her paranormal experiences and encounters, or \u201cvisits,\u201d from extraterrestrials that she has experienced along with her twin sister, Audrey Hewins, as far back as they both can remember.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would tell my parents I was afraid to go to bed. I was afraid the bald men were going to get me,\u201d Hewins said. \u201cI was seeing all sorts of things behind the veil that people don\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nLiving near the Hockomock Swamp and the Freetown-Fall River State Forest, sites where many strange occurrences have been reported, only intensified the experiences that the twins were having, Hewins said during the documentary interview.\n\n\u201cWe had the Hockomock swamp pretty much in our backyard,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nShe said there are many different extraterrestrial species that she sees and communicates with, both benevolent and malevolent.\n\n\u201cAll these beings are highly intelligent,\u201d Hewins said. \u201cAnd they know everything about us because they\u2019re telepathic.\u201d\n\nShe described a battle between the dark and the light side of these beings, which she called angels and demons. Hewins eventually realized how to repel the negative beings, by projecting love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery religion has pieces of the truth but, where they are in certain parts of the world, things are different. Things are interpreted differently,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nShe said there is a \u201cspiritual awakening\u201d happening in the world that is being helped along by extraterrestrials.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s falling apart. If somebody doesn\u2019t intervene, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cI do believe this is a global intervention and they\u2019re doing it in steps.\u201d\n\nShortly after moving to Maine in 2006, the Hewins twins founded Starborn Support, a national online support group \u201cto assist and provide emotional support to those who feel they have had an extraterrestrial encounter,\u201d according to the group\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine doing this alone. A lot of people do it. That\u2019s why I started the support group,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nThe group hosts gatherings for \u201cexperiencers,\u201d those who report having a UFO or ET encounter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the interview on Sept. 11, Hewins, filmmaker Tyler Roberts, and film producer Jess Weiner gathered with other experiencers to call on ETs to visit and then watch the sky for UFOs.\n\nThe group saw several bright floating dots that could not be readily identified, but many were suspected satellites moving across the night sky.\n\nAccording to NASA\u2019s website, UFOs can be \u201crocket launches, comets, military jets, weather balloons, sounding rockets, satellites, meteors and fireballs, experimental craft (if you are lucky) and odd clouds (such as lenticular clouds, which are lentil-shaped and resemble flying saucers).\u201d\n\nIn recent years, UFOs, or as the federal government has started referring to them, unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs, have gained mainstream attention with hearings held before the U.S. Congress.\n\nFilmmaker Tyler Roberts grew up in Billerica, which is a part of the triangle and home to what he referred to as the \u201cmost haunted road in Massachusetts.\u201d He feels like he is meant to tell the story he is crafting in his first feature-length film.\n\n\u201cThe more I think the world is black and white, the more gray I see,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also traveled to Bridgewater and Salem, Mass., where he encountered many synchronicities which led him to Hewins.\n\n\u201cThese are things I\u2019m running into, and I can\u2019t ignore them,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s slapping me in the face over and over again, saying \u2018tell the story.\u2019\u201d\n\nRoberts currently hosts a podcast, \u201cTotal Disclosure,\u201d in which he interviews people about UFOs and cover-up conspiracies, including credible sources like retired federal government officials.\n\nThere is a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for post-production expenses on Roberts\u2019 self-funded documentary. The trailer is expected to be released in October, just in time for \u201cspooky season,\u201d he said."

        "article_content": "For most people, an extinct species is an abstraction, a set of bones they might have seen on display in a museum. For Gennady Boeskorov, they are things he has interacted with directly, studying their fur, their skin, their internal organs\u2014experiencing these animals much as they existed thousands of years ago. Some of the well-preserved Pleistocene animals he has worked with include the mummified remains of woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius), an extinct form of rabbit (Lepus tanaiticus), and cave lion cubs (Panthera spelaea).\n\nHis latest paper also makes it clear that woolly rhinoceroses belong on this list. Boeskorov is a senior researcher at the Diamond and Precious Metals Geology Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as a professor at the North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk. This July, he and his colleagues described the relatively recent discovery of three woolly rhinoceros mummies, one of which is new to science, in a paper published in the journal Doklady Earth Sciences.\n\nWoolly rhinos (Coelodonta antiquitatis) were stocky, long-haired, two-horned denizens that inhabited Eurasia during the Pleistocene, a period that includes the most recent glacial expansion. They coexisted with woolly mammoths, placing second on the list of largest animals in this ecosystem (behind their tusked proboscidean coevals), and shared a similar dense coat of hair to protect against the cold.\n\nWe\u2019ve learned a great deal from their bones; we\u2019re learning even more thanks to their mummies. Being able to directly observe their hair and skin, for example, offers more evidence regarding just how well-adapted these animals were to their harsh environment. And the preservation of soft tissue has allowed us to test a hypothesis that was based on a combination of the organization of their skeletons and depictions in cave art.\n\nWoolly rhino fossils are abundant, but their mummies are exceedingly rare. To date, there have only been a handful of nearly complete woolly rhinos (although news of another has been recently announced). The three mummies in this paper all hail from Yakutia\u2014also known as the Sakha Republic\u2014in northeastern Russia, but they are vastly different in age and preservation.\n\nA trio of finds\n\nSasha is the first complete baby woolly rhino ever discovered. Although missing about half of its body, it is arguably the most well-preserved of the three, maintaining its fluffy little strawberry-blonde head, a couple of legs, and much of its fluffy torso. The loss of its lower half prevents determination of its sex, but Sasha was between 12 and 18 months old when it died, based on its teeth and the sutures within its skull as seen through CT scans.\n\nSo Sasha might have still been nursing at the time of death. Wear on its frontal horn\u2014the second horn following the one above its nose\u2014may have been caused by \u201crubbing against its mother\u2019s belly\u201d as it nursed, scientists suggested in 2015. The mummy was found in 2014 along the banks of a river, and although the cause of death has yet to be determined, sediment in its nasal passages indicate drowning in mud.\n\nBy contrast, the newest mummy is missing much of one side of its body, including most of the intestines\u2014the result of predation, according to the authors. The other side, however, preserves skin, some hair, and soft tissues. Nicknamed the \u201cAbyisky rhinoceros\u201d for its discovery in Yakutia\u2019s Abyisky District in 2020, it is estimated to be a juvenile of about 4 to 4.5 years. This mummy was also found along the banks of a river and, just like Sasha, its sex hasn\u2019t been determined.\n\nClues to its age, however, were found among the animal\u2019s overall height, its skull bones, and the length and characteristics of its nasal horn (the horn that grows right above its nostrils). Like tree rings or the rings found in mammoth tusks, the number of transverse stripes on the outside of nasal horns indicate the animal\u2019s age. The Abyisky mummy has little surviving hair; tufts of it appear in bits and pieces. The manner of death remains a mystery, but arthropod remnants in its hair indicate that its carcass spent time in a small body of fresh water.\n\nBoth the oldest at the time of her death and the oldest in terms of discovery, the Kolyma mummy was uncovered in 2007 in a Kolyma gold mine. The position in which her body was found\u2014her legs pressed to her torso and her head stretched upwards\u2014indicates she fell into and was trapped within a confined space. Like the Abyisky mummy, she is well-preserved on one side of her body, but she was not preserved whole. Her horns and legs were found nearby. Her skeletonized head\u2014once joined to the body\u2014was separated when she was excavated from the sediment. Her hair is preserved in tufts.\n\nAn udder and nipples are among the anatomical evidence that this is a female. The transverse stripes on her horn, along with teeth, skull, and height, confirm her age at death was approximately 20 years. Spores and pollen within her preserved stomach confirm what was deduced by previous studies of woolly rhino teeth: they enjoyed an herbivorous diet of grasses, shrubs, and numerous other plants."

The Eagles are favored by 5.5 points.\n\nPhiladelphia opened the season with a 34-29 win over Green Bay, and new RB Saquon Barkley was the star of the show.\n\nHe scored three touchdowns (two rushing, one receiving), so all eyes will be on him on MNF to see if he can repeat that superstar performance.\n\nAtlanta, on the other hand, struggled in its first game with QB Kirk Cousins.\n\nThe Falcons scored one touchdown in an 18-10 loss to Pittsburgh. It\u2019s fair to wonder if Cousins is still dealing with the effects of the Achilles injury that cost him the second half of last season.\n\nTo compete with Philly on MNF, the Falcons must find another level in a hurry."

It contains some fun and handy features that all Apple TV owners should check out \u2014 especially if you\u2019re an Apple TV+ or Apple Fitness+ subscriber.\n\nThe new tvOS 18 is compatible with every Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD model, but some features are limited to the Apple TV 4K.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe latest update to Apple\u2019s TV-oriented software brings a number of enhancements, starting with InSight, a feature that lets you see detailed information on actors, characters, and music from every live-action Apple TV+ movie and show onscreen in real time. Amazon Prime Video users will be familiar with the idea \u2014 it\u2019s a lot like Amazon\u2019s X-ray feature.\n\nThe software also has a new version of the Enhance Dialogue feature powered by machine learning and computational audio, which Apple says will deliver greater vocal clarity. Subtitles are also more intelligent and responsive. They automatically appear in the moment where they\u2019d be most useful, including when you press mute or skip back while watching, or when the language in a show or movie doesn\u2019t match your Apple TV\u2019s language setting.\n\nScreen savers, like the Aerial collection, are a fan favorite feature of the Apple TV, and tvOS 18 introduces a new type called Portraits. Unfortunately, this is one of those Apple TV 4K-only features we mentioned above. In fact, it only works with Apple TV 4K Gen 2 and higher models. The Portraits option lets you pick your favorite photos of people, pets, nature, or cities from your photo library and overlay them with a stylized clock.\n\nLive Captions for FaceTime now works with Continuity Camera in tvOS 18, letting you read what others are saying on a FaceTime call on your TV. It currently works with English in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nApple Fitness+ also gets a new design in tvOS 18, with personalized recommendations for workouts and meditations, a new search tool, and enhanced Awards.\n\nApple has been gradually making the Apple TV a central hub from which you can manage and use many of the company\u2019s HomeKit home automation features. In tvOS 18, that continues with new options included in iOS 18 such as guest access, which provides users with ways to grant guests (who have iPhones) control of locks, garage doors, and security systems. You can also schedule individualized or time-based access to the home with smart locks and view an activity history for guests.\n\nThough not Apple TV-specific, the iOS 18 update also lets you grant guests control of the music playing from a HomePod and HomePod mini using SharePlay and Apple Music. AirPlay is also now spatial audio-compatible when streaming from an iPhone and iPad to HomePod and Dolby Atmos Music/AirPlay-compatible audio equipment.\n\nTwo things that Apple has promised for tvOS 18 won\u2019t be ready with today\u2019s release: 21:9 support for playing movies and shows on projectors and new screen savers, like Snoopy, will be coming later in the year. So, too, will robot vacuum cleaner compatibility with the Home app.\n\nHow to upgrade\n\nIf you have automatic software updates turned on, your compatible Apple TV will update itself to tvOS 18 in the coming days. However, if you\u2019re anxious to try the new features right away, here\u2019s how:"

        "article_content": "The significance of data privacy has surged to the forefront of public and corporate consciousness. With increasing incidents of data breaches and unauthorized access, businesses and individuals alike are faced with the challenge of safeguarding their sensitive information. As a result, data privacy software solutions have emerged as essential tools for managing and protecting personal and organizational data. This guide aims to explore the various aspects of these solutions, including their functionalities, benefits, and best practices for implementation, empowering users to make informed decisions about data protection in a rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nTypes of Data Privacy Software Solutions\n\nData privacy software solutions can be categorized into several types, each designed to address specific needs within an organization. These include encryption software, which protects data by converting it into a secure format that can only be read by those who have the decryption key. Data loss prevention (DLP) tools are another significant category, focusing on preventing unauthorized users from accessing, sharing, or transmitting sensitive information.\n\nNext, we have identity and access management (IAM) solutions that ensure individuals have the appropriate level of access to systems and data based on their role. Furthermore, privacy compliance software assists organizations in adhering to legal regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, providing tools that facilitate audits and compliance checks. Each category of software has unique functionalities that help businesses manage data privacy challenges more effectively.\n\nChoosing the right type of solution is crucial, as different organizations have different requirements based on size, industry, and regulatory obligations. Understanding these various categories helps businesses select the tools that best fit their privacy goals and risk management strategies. Looking at the Privacy Engine study about Data Subject Access Rights (DSAR) statistics worldwide, it is significant to note that a lot of organizations have had challenges with managing DSAR requests manually. Implementing the right data privacy software can alleviate these challenges and improve overall compliance efforts.\n\nKey Features to Look For\n\nWhen evaluating data privacy software solutions, it\u2019s essential to look for key features that enhance functionality and usability. Firstly, robust encryption capabilities are a must, as they protect sensitive information both in transit and at rest. Additionally, an intuitive user interface simplifies the management of complex data protection tasks, particularly for users who may not be technologically savvy.\n\nAnother critical feature is real-time monitoring, which allows businesses to detect and respond to data security incidents as they occur. This includes alerts for unauthorized access attempts or data transfers that fall outside predefined policies. Moreover, strong reporting capabilities are valuable, enabling organizations to generate compliance reports and analytics that inform ongoing data protection strategies.\n\nIntegration capability with existing IT systems is essential. The software should seamlessly connect with other tools and platforms in use, from cloud services to CRM systems, ensuring a synergistic ecosystem that promotes strong data privacy without overwhelming internal resources.\n\nBenefits of Implementing Data Privacy Solutions\n\nImplementing data privacy software solutions offers numerous benefits that can significantly enhance an organization\u2019s overall security posture. One of the primary advantages is the reduced risk of data breaches, which can lead to severe financial and reputational harm. By deploying effective data protection tools, organizations can mitigate potential vulnerabilities and better safeguard sensitive information.\n\nThese solutions can improve customer trust and loyalty in a world where consumers are increasingly concerned about how their data is managed and protected, demonstrating a commitment to data privacy can be a competitive advantage. Organizations that employ full-fledged data protection strategies may find that their customers are more willing to engage and share information confidently.\n\nAdopting data privacy software can help streamline operations and compliance processes. With automated features for reporting and audits, businesses save time and resources that otherwise would be allocated to manual compliance efforts. This efficiency not only aids in regulatory adherence but also allows teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than being bogged down by administrative tasks.\n\nBest Practices for Implementation\n\nImplementing data privacy software solutions effectively requires careful planning and execution. First and foremost, organizations should conduct a thorough assessment of their current data privacy practices and identify any gaps that need addressing. This audit will inform the selection of software that specifically targets areas requiring improvement, ensuring that invested resources yield tangible benefits.\n\nInvolving key stakeholders from various departments during the implementation process is vital. This collaboration fosters buy-in and understanding across teams, ensuring that everyone is on board with the new practices and tools. Providing comprehensive training and resources for employees enhances the adoption of data privacy protocols, creating a culture of vigilance and accountability.\n\nIt is beneficial to continuously evaluate and update data privacy strategies and technologies in response to evolving threats and regulatory changes. By staying proactive and adaptable, organizations can ensure their data protection measures remain robust and relevant in an ever-changing landscape.\n\nCommon Challenges Faced\n\nWhile pursuing data privacy software solutions, organizations often encounter several challenges. One major difficulty is the complexity of implementing new systems, especially for large organizations with numerous legacy systems in place. This can lead to integration issues that hinder data protection rather than enhance it, necessitating thorough planning and investment in expertise.\n\nAnother hurdle is securing adequate buy-in from leadership and staff members. Resistance to change can stem from a lack of understanding of the importance of data privacy, or apprehension towards new technologies. Addressing these concerns through education and transparent communication regarding the necessity and benefits of data privacy measures is critical.\n\nBudget constraints can significantly impact the ability to procure and maintain effective data privacy solutions. Organizations must strive to balance cost with quality, seeking scalable solutions that provide necessary functionalities within budgetary limits. Identifying cost-effective solutions that do not compromise security is key to successfully overcoming this challenge.\n\nFuture Trends in Data Privacy\n\nLooking ahead, several emerging trends are shaping the landscape of data privacy software solutions. One notable trend is the increasing emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies. These advancements facilitate more sophisticated data analysis and threat detection, improving the ability of organizations to respond to potential breaches swiftly.\n\nAnother trend is the growing importance of privacy by design. Organizations are now prioritizing privacy considerations in all stages of product development and software deployment. By embedding privacy into their systems from the outset, businesses can foster a proactive approach to data protection, rather than merely reacting to violations after they occur.\n\nAs global data protection regulations evolve, future solutions will likely need to incorporate multi-jurisdictional compliance capabilities. Organizations operating internationally will benefit from software that can streamline and automate compliance with varied laws across different regions, ensuring adherence while reducing the administrative burden.\n\nThe demand for robust data privacy software solutions will continue to grow as organizations recognize the significance of protecting their sensitive information. By staying informed and proactive, businesses can navigate this landscape confidently and maintain trust with customers while safeguarding their competitive advantage."
