            "article_content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) app downloads rose to 1.5 billion in 2024 compared to 800 million reported in 2023, according to a report by SensorTower.\n\nThe report titled \u201cThe State of Mobile 2024,\u2019 revealed that in 2024, apps mentioning AI-related terms in their names, subtitles, or descriptions amassed more than 17 billion downloads globally, an increase from 5 billion downloads in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis accounted for 13 percent of all app downloads that year. Key markets contributing over a billion downloads each included India, the United States, China Mainland, Indonesia, and Brazil,\u201d it said.\n\nIn late 2022, the world witnessed the rise of generative AI applications, driven by the debut of ChatGPT. Since then, interest in these technologies has surged, resulting in growth in in-app purchase (IAP) revenue and downloads.\n\nAccording to SensorTower data, IAP revenue for AI chatbot and AI art generator apps soared from $30 million in 2022 to $455 million in 2023, and nearly $1.3 billion by 2024.\n\nThe report said the United States emerged as the dominant market for generative AI apps in 2024, accounting for 45 percent of global revenue, the United Kingdom (4 percent), Germany (4 percent), Japan (3 percent), and Canada (3 percent) followed, reflecting a strong adoption of AI technology in developed markets.\n\nBrazil ranked as the seventh-largest market for generative AI apps despite not being a top 10 market for overall mobile consumer spending. Conversely, China Mainland lagged, contributing less than 2 percent of IAP revenue for this genre in 2024.\n\nIt said that while AI chatbots remain the most popular subgenre, some of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies have launched their own AI chatbots, including Google Gemini, ByteDance\u2019s Doubao, and Microsoft Copilot.\n\n\u201cThis influx of competition spurred rapid growth in the sector, with AI chatbot downloads climbing 119 percent year-over-year (YoY) in Q4 2024. Although AI art generators experienced slower growth, they still achieved 85 million downloads, up 21 percent YoY,\u201d it stated.\n\nHowever, ChatGPT maintained its position as the market leader, commanding 40 percent of global generative AI consumer spend and 23 percent of total downloads in 2024.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s mobile adoption has skyrocketed since its launch, with monthly active users (MAUs) increasing by 500 percent YoY to more than 160 million in Q3 2024.\n\nAmong apps released in the past three years, ChatGPT was the third-fastest to reach 50 million MAUs globally, achieving the milestone just five months after its launch in May 2023, this growth came despite the app\u2019s delayed release on Google Play in July 2023, several months after its iOS debut.\n\n16 different generative AI apps also achieved at least $10 million in IAP revenue in 2024, while 25 surpassed 10 million downloads.\n\nOn the other hand, developers are increasingly incorporating AI features into apps across various categories. From travel to education to social networking, the possibilities for integrating generative AI are vast.\n\n\u201cApp developers have also shown agility, with the number of apps adding AI-related terms to their names or descriptions more than doubling in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\n\u201cEven as the growth rate of AI-themed apps slowed in 2024, interest remained robust. Over 3,000 apps introduced AI-related terms in 2024, spanning 15 different categories, including productivity, photo & video, lifestyle, finance, and music,\u201d it said.\n\nShare"

            "article_content": "\u2018Presence\u2019 Review \u2013 Paranormal Purgatory\n\nA still from Presence by Steven Soderbergh, an official selection of the Premieres Program at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. Courtesy of Sundance Institute.\n\nWritten by David Koepp (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, The Mummy 2017) and directed by Steven Soderbergh (Logan Lucky, Side Effects), Presence has an intriguing concept that doesn\u2019t completely work in its execution. Shot in three weeks almost entirely in one location with a $2 million budget, Presence is a creative powerhouse that lacks a lasting impression.\n\nAll of Presence is from the perspective of an entity in a suburban house. The supernatural thriller seemingly has no close-ups while the cinematography is different in a way that seems like it was shot with a slight fish-eye lens. A family, The Paynes \u2013 Rebekah (Lucy Liu), Chris (Chris Sullivan), Chloe (Callina Liang), and Tyler (Eddy Maday), moves into the empty house revealed at the beginning of the film.\n\n(L to R) Chloe (Callina Liang), Chris (Chris Sullivan), Tyler (Eddy Maday), Rebekah (Lucy Liu), and Cece (Julia Fox) in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nThe SNAFU\u2019d relationship between The Paynes is palpable as soon as they\u2019re introduced. Rebekah is committing financial fraud and her husband Chris is contemplating separation or divorce. Rebekah also prioritizes her older son Tyler and his athleticism in swimming over her younger daughter Chloe, who barely ranks acknowledgement. Meanwhile, Chris is concerned for Chloe since her best friend abruptly died and she still hasn\u2019t gotten over it.\n\nThe idea of a horror or supernatural film from the perspective of the ghost or entity is insanely cool, but the issue here is that this presence isn\u2019t given much to do besides witness people have sex and argue.\n\nCallina Liang as Chloe in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nThere are expected supernatural elements here like doors mysteriously opening or closing on their own, a stack of books floating in the air one by one and being stacked neatly on a nearby desk, and shelves and posters being ripped off the wall.\n\nBefore The Paynes arrive, the first scene of the film is supposed to be this entity wandering around an empty house. It\u2019s fascinating at first but becomes dizzying and nauseating, which may represent the claustrophobic aspect of being trapped somewhere with no escape but still not entirely fun to watch.\n\nPresence features the first truly nasty on-screen character of the year in Ryan (West Mulholland). Ryan is a popular classmate of Tyler and a drug dealer. He gets romantically involved with Chloe and tries to appear nonchalant and supportive.\n\nCracks bubble up to the surface early on as he loses his temper often and his rambling typically sounds like a villain attempting to explain their evil plan in detail to a subdued victim.\n\nThe film\u2019s editing is bizarre since most sequences either feel like one-take or suddenly shift to black before the next scene. Presence is presented like a bunch of scenes randomly stitched together that just happen to make a semi-coherent story.\n\n(L to R) Chris (Chris Sullivan) and Rebekah (Lucy Liu) in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nThe acting in Presence is fine, but two of the four Payne family members are complete jerks while the other two are pushovers. This dynamic makes it difficult to get invested in any of their character developments.\n\nThe existence of the entity in the film is deeply connected to grief and trauma, which allows people who have almost died or experienced something truly traumatic to see or feel someone who has died.\n\nCallina Liang as Chloe in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nA medium is brought into The Payne\u2019s home after everyone but Chris stops making fun of Chloe\u2019s encounters with the entity. The medium does little for the film apart from solidifying that Chloe isn\u2019t making it up and drawing attention to an item in their living room that will be a part of the last scene in the film.\n\nThere is a unique concept in Presence that hasn\u2019t entirely been explored in the genre, especially when combined with captivatingly different cinematography and a talented cast. But there aren\u2019t enough actual horror elements in Presence to be scary, and the family drama is mostly uninteresting apart from this entity being a part of their lives.\n\nLucy Liu as Rebekah in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Presence (2025), Neon\n\nPresence is a close-but-no-cigar thriller with unusual camera tricks and everyone staring off slightly to the left or right to drive its sense of mystery.\n\nPresence (2025), Neon 2 OVERALL SCORE PROS Refreshing concept\n\nDecent acting CONS The tedius nature of drama over horror\n\nCinematography becomes tiresome"

While time is tracked differently in Blades in the Dark \u2013 with the original game set in 847 IE \u2013 we're now entering 968 AC and the rulebook takes some groovy-as-heck cues from real-world '60s graphic design.\n\nCurrently on our best tabletop RPGs list, Blades in the Dark has a huge following. And as much as we didn't expect a '60s sequel, I can certainly see where they're going with it. This is a zippy, engaging TRPG, and one that's sure to work well with revolutionary '60s counter-culture references and, of course, a swingin' aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing the same core mechanics, and compatible with Blades in the Dark: Deep Cuts modules as well, there have been a few changes to the system outlined in the playtest document.\n\nOne of the main changes to note comes in the form of the Gameplay Cycle. This is split into three parts: Crew business, trouble engine, and personal business. Crew business is the quickfire setup of a situation, and the runthrough of the score (which sees players overcoming obstacles, having flashbacks and maybe completing an operation).\n\nPreviously in the later Downtime phase, the payout, heat, harm, and complications come in here, with a moment to debrief before the trouble engine revs up and the GM moves forward faction clocks, generates and updates trouble for the Crew to encounter.\n\nCredit: Evil Hat Productions\n\nBlades in the Dark's original 'Downtime' phase now comes under 'personal business', which forms the second half of the gameplay cycle in Blades '68. In it, players can \"indulge their vice to remove stress, recover harm, work on a long-term project, or achieve other goals.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of my favorite things is that you can be a Swinger, who handles the complex social landscape with \"audacity, charisma, and panache\". Their list of questions to ask the group, to get a feel for how everyone knows each other, include:\n\nWhich one of you went to that big party with me the other night?\n\nWhich one of you is my competition on the dance floor?\n\nWhich one of you comes to me for fashion advice?\n\nCredit: Evil Hat Productions\n\nAs for the lore, a lot has happened since the start of the Unity Era. Still set in Doskvol, the times have changed greatly in 100 years. The Imperial fleet has seen its last successful leviathan hunt lead into \"Dark years of failing lightning barriers, famine, and panic\"; the Age of Consensus had Shattered Isles nations collaborating in a time of \"peace, rationality, and stability through conformity\"; and Imperial troops were sent to invade a separatist city set up in a bastion by Severosi radicals in The Sevrin Invasion.\n\nRight now you can sign up for the Blades '68 playtest materials from Evil Hat Productions, which outlines the full round of changes in a fully playable draft of the game. Just be aware that the final draft could see changes to the system as it currently stands, based on player feedback.\n\nFor more recommendations, why not check out the some solo RPGs, or work your way through the best D&D books."

            "article_content": "Scientists recently reported an unexpected deep-sea development in the Pacific: certain metallic rocks seem to be making oxygen in the dark, without light or sunshine, at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThis idea runs counter to the usual belief that oxygen only forms in sunlight through photosynthesis.\n\nAlthough these findings have stirred debate, the central claim is that potato-sized nodules found thousands of feet below the surface appear to split seawater molecules and release oxygen.\n\nOxygen and photosynthesis \u2013 the basics\n\nSince the late 1700s, we\u2019ve been taught that light creates oxygen through photosynthesis, a crucial natural process that keeps life on Earth thriving.\n\nPlants, algae, and some bacteria soak up sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, nature uses light as fuel to produce the oxygen we breathe and keep everything on Earth alive.\n\nPhotosynthesis not only gives energy to these organisms but also releases oxygen into the atmosphere, maintaining the perfect balance of gases that most life forms need.\n\nUntil the discovery of dark oxygen, it has been commonly accepted knowledge that without light, photosynthesis would grind to a halt, and our planet wouldn\u2019t have the oxygen-rich air we rely on every day.\n\nDeep-sea rocks making oxygen\n\nExploration in a region called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone \u2013 where deep-sea mining companies are eyeing metals resources like cobalt and nickel \u2013 uncovered ferromanganese nodules resting on the ocean floor.\n\nFerromanganese nodules are like little treasure rocks that settle on the ocean floor, packed with metals such as manganese and iron.\n\nThese nodules form slowly over millions of years as minerals from seawater build up in layers around a tiny core, like a shark tooth or a piece of shell.\n\nThink of them as underwater onions, with each layer adding more minerals and creating these cool, rounded shapes.\n\nResearchers suggested that the nodules may produce electric charges that spark electrolysis, generating oxygen and hydrogen.\n\nHow do the rocks produce oxygen?\n\nEarly studies raised plenty of questions about the process and the potential effect on seafloor life.\n\nLeading the push for more answers is Andrew Sweetman, a professor at the Scottish Association for Marine Science.\n\nHe is running a three-year project to investigate how these nodules might form oxygen in the absence of light. One of his goals is to see if this phenomenon appears in other parts of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.\n\n\u201cOur discovery of dark oxygen was a paradigm shift in our understanding of the deep sea and potentially life on Earth, but it threw up more questions than answers,\u201d said Sweetman.\n\nHe and his team will also look into whether microbial reactions help release hydrogen, an energy source for certain deep-sea microbes.\n\nFreshwater mysteries\n\nDark oxygen has popped up in other surprising, light-deprived places.\n\nEmil Ruff detected oxygen in freshwater samples beneath Alberta, Canada. It appeared in groundwater that had been isolated for tens of thousands of years, yet still contained enough oxygen to support life.\n\n\u201cAfter 40,000 years or 30,000 years (separated from surface processes), there\u2019s no reason really to think that there should be any oxygen left,\u201d remarked Ruff.\n\nHe found that special bacteria could produce oxygen on their own by breaking down certain dissolved compounds.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ruff found that the quantity of oxygen produced was enough to sustain other oxygen-dependent microbial life in the groundwater.\n\nChallenging dark oxygen\n\nNot all scientists are in agreement about this dark oxygen discovery. Some deep-sea mining interests challenged Sweetman\u2019s work, saying they have found no such electrical oddities in the nodules.\n\nThe Metals Co. submitted a rebuttal of the scientific research paper to Nature Geoscience, which awaits peer review.\n\nMeanwhile, independent observers note the need for more experiments. A research oceanographer at the US Geological Survey\u2019s Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center in Santa Cruz, California, said the USGS has not observed any electrical phenomena in ferromanganese nodules examined so far.\n\nShe was not involved in either Sweetman\u2019s or Ruff\u2019s research.\n\nNASA hopes these findings might hint at life in places beyond Earth. Dark ocean worlds like Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus are prime targets for research.\n\nSweetman shared that the space agency wants to test whether high pressures found on those icy moons can trigger oxygen generation in deep-sea rocks without direct sunlight. If the same basic chemistry works there, it could point to possible microbial life in alien seas.\n\nDark oxygen and deep-sea mining\n\nThe Clarion-Clipperton Zone sits far offshore, and mining there is governed by the International Seabed Authority. Critics argue that removing nodules in huge volumes could destroy habitats.\n\nOrganizations like Fauna & Flora warn of irreparable harm, saying it may disturb carbon storage in the ocean. Sweetman believes it is risky to harvest seabed minerals until scientists know a lot more about these systems.\n\nHe acknowledges the controversy and plans to address critics in peer-reviewed forums. For now, the hunt for hard data continues, fueled by the hope of expanding our understanding of life \u2013 both here and possibly on other worlds.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Geoscience.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Experts believe they have finally found the last Anglo-Saxon king's residence\n\nArchaeologists have made a stunning breakthrough after discovering an 11th Centry medieval toilet that has helped to unravel a 2,000-year-old mystery. Researchers from the University of Exeter and the University of Newcastle believe they have uncovered Harold Godwinson, the last Saxon king of England\u2019s long-lost residence. Experts had until now been unable to pinpoint the exact location of King Harold\u2019s residence in Bosham. Illustrations of the grand hall in his residence appear twice in an 11th-century embroidered work known as the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts events leading up to the 1066 Norman Conquest of England. The tapestry shows Harold feasting in a grand hall before sailing to France. While the church in Bosham still stands today, experts have been left baffled by the hall's exact location.\n\nA The tapestry shows Harold seen feasting in a grand hall before sailing to France.\n\nHowever, researchers' re-examining evidence found in 2006 by West Sussex Archaeology led to a stunning revelation. The initial 2006 investigation located two previously unidentified medieval structures at the site. One structure is built into a modern-day private residence, and the other was found in the property's garden. Dr. Duncan Wright, Senior Lecturer in Medieval Archaeology at Newcastle University and project leader, said a toilet from the period found in the building offered a vital clue. While having a toilet in your home is practically a given in every household today, they were typically only found in high-status and elite residences in England during the 10th and 11th centuries.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "When astronomers found a large world farther out than Pluto, it became one of the final nails in the coffin of our ninth planet.\n\nEris is too distant for even the largest telescopes to resolve into a disk. This artist\u2019s concept shows astronomers\u2019 best guess as to what it and its moon Dysnomia look like. Credit: NASA/ESA/STScI\n\nEight billion miles (14 billion kilometers) from Earth, at the solar system\u2019s ragged edge, lies Eris \u2014 a planet-sized oddball of a world that emerged unexpectedly from the darkness 20 years ago. Named for the capricious Greek goddess of discord, trouble-stirring Eris would doubtless be pleased that her celestial namesake caused even mild-mannered astronomers to quarrel, as its discovery caused the nature of what constitutes a \u201cplanet\u201d to rear its controversial head.\n\nWith a magnitude of 18.7, Eris currently lies in the southern constellation Cetus the Whale, barely resolvable even by the world\u2019s largest telescopes. Due to its vast distance \u2014 some 95.6 astronomical units (AU; 1 AU is the average Earth-Sun distance) \u2014 its slow apparent progress across the sky makes it notoriously difficult to spot.\n\nAt Eris\u2019 distance, the Sun appears as a tiny star in the coal-dark sky, its light taking 13 hours to traverse the space between them and weakly illuminate a glistening surface of methane and nitrogen ices. Eris is three times more distant than Pluto. And its relationship to Pluto \u2014 a world demoted since 2006 from the solar system\u2019s ninth planet to a lowly dwarf planet, in large part due to the discovery of Eris \u2014 remains contentious today.\n\nA distant find\n\nIn 2001, astronomers at Palomar Observatory in California began systematically seeking planet-sized objects beyond Neptune. This time-consuming process targeted small pockets of the sky, utilizing powerful imaging software to identify anything that moved against the starry backdrop. To limit the number of false-positive data returns due to image resolution, the software excluded anything moving slower than 1.5 arcseconds per hour.\n\n\u201cThings like Eris were precisely what we were looking for when we started this survey in 2001,\u201d says Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology, who co-discovered Eris with Chad Trujillo, then of the Gemini Observatory, and David Rabinowitz of Yale University. \u201cAt that time, nothing had ever been found beyond about 60 AU, so we tuned the survey to concentrate on this area.\u201d\n\nBut an ironic consequence was that images of the slow-moving Eris, taken by Brown\u2019s team with the 48-inch (1.2 meters) Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar on Oct. 21, 2003, slipped entirely through the net, falling below their speed cutoff.\n\nIn the months that followed, several new trans-Neptunian objects \u2014 bodies whose orbits have an average distance beyond that of Neptune \u2014 were discovered: red-hued Sedna in November 2003 and ellipsoid-shaped Haumea in December 2004. Sedna\u2019s 11,400-year orbit carries it to an aphelion (its farthest point from the Sun) well beyond the heliopause, the region near the solar system\u2019s periphery where the Sun cedes gravitational influence to the interstellar medium.\n\nAt the time of its discovery, Sedna lay at 90 AU \u2014 8.3 billion miles (13.3 billion km) from the Sun, three times more distant than Neptune. And significantly, it moved at a paltry 1.75 arcseconds per hour. That prompted Brown\u2019s team to reanalyze their older data with lower limits on angular motion, then painstakingly sort through previously excluded images by eye.\n\n\u201cWhen we found Sedna in 2003 at close to 90 AU and just barely at the limit of our software, we wondered whether we might have missed something even further away,\u201d Brown remembers. \u201cIt took months of additional work and processing, until suddenly Eris pops out of the data! In the end, it was the only extra object we found from all of the reprocessing \u2014 but worth it!\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s reanalysis finally pinpointed Eris on Jan. 5, 2005. At that time, it was simply called 2003 UB 313 . Brown excitedly called his wife, Diane, with the news: \u201cI found a planet!\u201d\n\nBut his words were ominously propitious, as unfolding circumstances on Earth quickly overtook the discovery.\n\nMore planets?\n\nEarly observations hinted that Eris might be bigger than Pluto, whose own size remained uncertain until the New Horizons spacecraft flew past in July 2015.\n\nBut whether larger or smaller than Pluto, hopes that Eris might also be granted planetary status were quickly dashed. For years, astronomers had hotly debated Pluto\u2019s planethood. Our then-ninth planet was smaller than any other planet, yet carried profound cultural connotations, endearing itself to generations who had grown up reciting the same solar system mnemonic in the classroom and universally accepted it as the ninth planet.\n\nThat long-held popular belief was turned on its head with the discoveries of Haumea, Sedna, Eris, and \u2014 a few months after Eris \u2014 Makemake in March 2005, forcing the astronomical community\u2019s hand. In August 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally defined a \u201cplanet\u201d as an object circling the Sun, sufficiently large and gravitationally massive to attain a spherical shape, and has cleared its region of space.\n\nUnder that definition, the new discoveries fell short on this third point, for none had cleared their respective celestial neighborhoods. But neither had Pluto. On Sept. 6, 2006, Pluto and the others were formally recategorized not as planets but as \u201cdwarf planets\u201d \u2014 objects orbiting the Sun that could achieve sphericity but were gravitationally incapable of dominating their environs.\n\n\u201cWe knew that second that we found it [Eris] that our concept of the solar system was going to have to change,\u201d says Brown. \u201cWe were either going to have to add new planets or subtract one. I would have predicted the former, but even though it means I lost my chance to be called the discoverer of a few new planets, I am delighted that astronomers had the nerve to make the right choice and realize that Pluto should never have been called a planet in the first place.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s in a name?\n\nOn Sept. 13, 2006, 2003 UB 313 was formally named Eris. But this had not been the original choice. One unofficial name used by Brown\u2019s team was Xena, honoring the titular character in the television show Xena: Warrior Princess \u2014 which coincidentally also began with an X, for what might have been the tenth planet.\n\n\u201cWe called it Xena right away, just as one of our internal code names,\u201d says Brown. \u201cBut when the final IAU decision came out, we decided to search for something in the Greek or Roman mythology to honor the fact that Xena had been something like a real planet for a good year. Not surprisingly, almost everything had been taken by various nondescript asteroids over the years.\u201d\n\nPopular suggestions rounded up in a survey by New Scientist ranged from Persephone to Pax, Galileo to Xena, Rupert to Nibiru, and Cerberus to Loki. The survey results even included the comically floated \u201cBob\u201d as an option, its originator quipping that it was easily pronounceable, non-offensive, and \u201cI think Uranus needs a break, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut everyone seemed to have avoided the goddess of discord and strife,\u201d whose Greek name was Eris, recalls Brown. \u201cAs soon as we saw it, we realized [it] was perfect.\u201d Just like the strife-inciting goddess of ancient Greece, the celestial Eris had prodded its own hornet\u2019s nest of debate both in the astronomical community and among the wider public.\n\nIt turns out that Eris is slightly smaller than Pluto, with an equatorial diameter 1,445 miles (2,326 km) and a surface area roughly equivalent to South America. But Eris is some 27 percent more massive than Pluto, likely due to a denser, rocky interior.\n\nA tiny moon, named Dysnomia after the mythological Eris\u2019 daughter and the goddess of lawlessness, was discovered in September 2005 by Brown\u2019s team at Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Dark as coal, one-third the size of Eris, and icy in nature, Dysnomia orbits every 16 days at a distance of 23,200 miles (37,300 km).\n\nEris\u2019 plain white fa\u00e7ade reflects some 96 percent of the Sun\u2019s light, making it one of the solar system\u2019s brightest surfaces. Its highly eccentric orbit carries it around the Sun every 559 years, bringing it as close as 37.9 AU (3.5 billion miles [5.6 billion km]) and carrying it as far as 97.5 AU (9.1 billion miles [15 billion km]). Surface temperatures hover around 42 kelvins \u2014 about \u2013384 degrees Fahrenheit (\u2013231 degrees Celsius).\n\nIts ubiquitous brightness is matched only by Saturn\u2019s icy moon Enceladus, but Brown does not believe cryovolcanism or geysers are necessarily responsible. \u201cEris is sufficiently cold that its atmosphere will be condensed onto the surface and I think that is really all that is going on,\u201d he says. \u201cPresumably as Eris gets closer to the Sun, the frosts will sublime and the surface will darken.\u201d\n\nHaving passed its most recent aphelion in 1977, Eris will reach perihelion in 2257. Plans for a flyby mission are being considered, with the most ideal launch opportunities in 2032 and 2044. Should such a mission take place, the spacecraft could reach Eris roughly 25 years after launch.\n\nAnd new discoveries would surely follow.\n\nRelated: Does Planet Nine exist?"

            "article_content": "With the new year underway, it\u2019s time to celebrate a remarkable 2024 full of citizen science with the Unistellar Network! Thousands of professional and amateur astronomers came together once again to observe, document, and contribute valuable data to the scientific community. From catching supernovae in the act to tracking exoplanet transits and unraveling asteroid mysteries, our network has been busier than ever. In fact, Unistellar observers broke a record this past year by making over 10,000 citizen science observations in 2024 alone. Let\u2019s take a journey through more of the year\u2019s highlights!\n\nComets: A Year of Bright Surprises and Fading Legends\n\n2024 was a spectacular year for comet observations, with 1,563 observations made by 246 observers around the world. Unistellar members continued to track the decline of Comet 103P/Hartley 2, documented multiple outbursts of 12P/Pons-Brooks, and, most excitingly, observed C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS)\u2014the brightest comet of the decade!\n\nComet 12P/Pons-Brooks during outburst, when it looked akin to the Millennium Falcon! Image by Aad Verveen.\n\nComet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) imaged by Unistellar Citizen Astronomer Karen Fischer.\n\nCosmic Cataclysms: An Explosive Universe\n\nOur network played a pivotal role in capturing some of the most energetic events in the cosmos. Two hundred Citizen Astronomers recorded 5,656 observations across 90 different targets, including 47 supernova candidates, 24 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and 11 variable stars. This data amounted to a staggering 1.3 million images of transient events taken in 2024.\n\nExoplanets: Unlocking the Secrets of Distant Worlds\n\nExoplanet hunters in the Unistellar Network had a busy year, observing over 130 unique exoplanets. With 133 telescopes over 6 continents, the network captured exoplanets transiting in front of their stars and even contributed to confirming two new exoplanets\u2014TIC 393818343 b and TIC 24129530 b! All of the participating Citizen Astronomers are listed as co-authors on these scientific papers, cementing their contributions to science.\n\nAsteroid Occultations: Timing the Shadows of Space Rocks\n\nIn 2024, Unistellar members recorded 408 occultation events, with 54 confirmed positive detections (meaning the asteroid\u2019s shadow was successfully captured). Some of the year\u2019s highlights include the longest recorded occultation event in Unistellar history when the asteroid 120 Lachesis blocked a star\u2019s light for nearly 38 seconds!\n\nThe occultation of a distant star by asteroid 120 Lachesis, captured by Steven Adkinson.\n\nPlanetary Defense & Satellite Tracking: Keeping an Eye on the Sky\n\nWhile planetary defense observations help track the orbits of near-Earth asteroids, man-made satellites are important to track as well. The Defense & Satellite division kept a close watch on these objects near or in Earth\u2019s orbit, making 1,263 planetary defense observations and 797 satellite observations.\n\nShape models of the asteroid 198 Ampella from different angles. Unistellar citizen science data contributed to determining the final shape.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next for 2025?\n\nWith another year of discoveries behind us, the Unistellar Network is gearing up for an even more exciting 2025. What new exoplanets will we help confirm? Will another bright comet steal the show? How many more asteroid shadows will we capture? One thing\u2019s for sure\u2014our citizen astronomers will be there, eyes (and telescopes) turned skyward, ready to unlock the next cosmic mystery.\n\nHere\u2019s to another incredible year of scientific collaboration, curiosity, and exploration. See you in 2025!"

            "article_content": "These types of models are most effective at solving complex problems, so if you have any PhD-level math problems you\u2019re cracking away at, you can try them out. Alternatively, if you\u2019ve had issues with getting previous models to respond properly to your most advanced prompts, you may want to try out this new reasoning model on them. To try out o3-mini, simply select \u201cReason\u201d when you start a new prompt on ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough reasoning models possess new capabilities, they come at a cost. OpenAI\u2019s o1-mini is 20 times more expensive to run than its equivalent non-reasoning model, GPT-4o mini. The company says its new model, o3-mini, costs 63% less than o1-mini per input token However, at $1.10 per million input tokens, it is still about seven times more expensive to run than GPT-4o mini.\n\nThis new model is coming right after the DeepSeek release that shook the AI world less than two weeks ago. DeepSeek\u2019s new model performs just as well as top OpenAI models, but the Chinese company claims it cost roughly $6 million to train, as opposed to the estimated cost of over $100 million for training OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4. (It\u2019s worth noting that a lot of people are interrogating this claim.)\n\nAdditionally, DeepSeek\u2019s reasoning model costs $0.55 per million input tokens, half the price of o3-mini, so OpenAI still has a way to go to bring down its costs. It\u2019s estimated that reasoning models also have much higher energy costs than other types, given the larger number of computations they require to produce an answer.\n\nThis new wave of reasoning models present new safety challenges as well. OpenAI used a technique called deliberative alignment to train its o-series models, basically having them reference OpenAI\u2019s internal policies at each step of its reasoning to make sure they weren\u2019t ignoring any rules.\n\nBut the company has found that o3-mini, like the o1 model, is significantly better than non-reasoning models at jailbreaking and \u201cchallenging safety evaluations\u201d\u2014essentially, it\u2019s much harder to control a reasoning model given its advanced capabilities. o3-mini is the first model to score as \u201cmedium risk\u201d on model autonomy, a rating given because it\u2019s better than previous models at specific coding tasks\u2014indicating \u201cgreater potential for self-improvement and AI research acceleration,\u201d according to OpenAI. That said, the model is still bad at real-world research. If it were better at that, it would be rated as high risk, and OpenAI would restrict the model\u2019s release."

            "article_content": "It\u2019s been just over a week since DeepSeek upended the AI world. The introduction of its open-weight model\u2014apparently trained on a fraction of the specialized computing chips that power industry leaders\u2014set off shock waves inside OpenAI. Not only did employees claim to see hints that DeepSeek had \u201cinappropriately distilled\u201d OpenAI\u2019s models to create its own, but the startup's success had Wall Street questioning whether companies like OpenAI were wildly overspending on compute.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek R1 is AI's Sputnik moment,\u201d wrote Marc Andreessen, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most influential and provocative inventors, on X.\n\nIn response, OpenAI is preparing to launch a new model today, ahead of its originally planned schedule. The model, o3-mini, will debut in both API and chat. Sources say it has o1 level reasoning with 4o-level speed. In other words, it\u2019s fast, cheap, smart, and designed to crush DeepSeek. (OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix says work on o3-mini began long before DeepSeek's debut and the goal was to launch by the end of January).\n\nThe moment has galvanized OpenAI staff. Inside the company, there\u2019s a feeling that\u2014particularly as DeepSeek dominates the conversation\u2014OpenAI must become more efficient or risk falling behind its newest competitor.\n\nPart of the issue stems from OpenAI\u2019s origins as a nonprofit research organization before becoming a profit-seeking powerhouse. An ongoing power struggle between the research and product groups, employees claim, has resulted in a rift between the teams working on advanced reasoning and those working on chat. (OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix says this is \u201cincorrect\u201d and notes that the leaders of these teams, chief product officer Kevin Weil and chief research officer Mark Chen, \u201cmeet every week and work closely to align on product and research priorities.\u201d)\n\nSome inside OpenAI want the company to build a unified chat product, one model that can tell whether a question requires advanced reasoning. So far, that hasn\u2019t happened. Instead, a drop-down menu in ChatGPT prompts users to decide whether they want to use GPT-4o (\u201cgreat for most questions\u201d) or o1 (\u201cuses advanced reasoning\u201d).\n\nSome staffers claim that while chat brings in the lion\u2019s share of OpenAI\u2019s revenue, o1 gets more attention\u2014and computing resources\u2014from leadership. \u201cLeadership doesn\u2019t care about chat,\u201d says a former employee who worked on (you guessed it) chat. \u201cEveryone wants to work on o1 because it\u2019s sexy, but the code base wasn\u2019t built for experimentation, so there\u2019s no momentum.\u201d The former employee asked to remain anonymous, citing a nondisclosure agreement.\n\nOpenAI spent years experimenting with reinforcement learning to fine-tune the model that eventually became the advanced reasoning system called o1. (Reinforcement learning is a process that trains AI models with a system of penalties and rewards.) DeepSeek built off the reinforcement learning work that OpenAI had pioneered in order to create its advanced reasoning system, called R1. \u201cThey benefited from knowing that reinforcement learning, applied to language models, works,\u201d says a former OpenAI researcher who is not authorized to speak publicly about the company.\n\n\u201cThe reinforcement learning [DeepSeek] did is similar to what we did at OpenAI,\u201d says another former OpenAI researcher, \u201cbut they did it with better data and cleaner stack.\u201d\n\nOpenAI employees say research that went into o1 was done in a code base, called the \u201cberry\u201d stack, built for speed. \u201cThere were trade-offs\u2014experimental rigor for throughput,\u201d says a former employee with direct knowledge of the situation.\n\nThose trade-offs made sense for o1, which was essentially an enormous experiment, code base limitations notwithstanding. They did not make as much sense for chat, a product used by millions of users that was built on a different, more reliable stack. When o1 launched and became a product, cracks started to emerge in OpenAI\u2019s internal processes. \u201cIt was like, \u2018why are we doing this in the experimental codebase, shouldn\u2019t we do this in the main product research codebase?\u2019\u201d the employee explains. \u201cThere was major pushback to that internally.\u201d"

And so, to coincide with our Predictions event on thedrum.com, throughout this week our journalists have been making some predictions of their own by spotlighting the agencies they believe will dominate the headlines this year.\n\nThey have done so armed with some important information, as all the agencies featured across this series have earned The Drum Recommends status on the strength of their recent performance and quality of work.\n\nAMV BBDO, Hearts & Science and Code and Theory were among those recognized in part one. It was the turn of FCB, Mower and Whalar in part two. Then Area 23, David Madrid, Zulu Alpha Kilo enjoyed their moment in part three. And, in part four, Ogilvy UK, Monks and DDB Colombia all featured. Today, we have more heavy hitters to recognize from across the globe.\n\nSo scroll on to hear from our latest Agencies to Watch honorees about how they\u2019re preparing themselves for the major trends upon us in 2025.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nThe Accenture Song-owned ad agency featured prominently at The Drum Awards for Advertising, winning Golds in the Finance, Sports and Sound Design categories, while its S\u00e3o Paulo office partnered with Dove to celebrate 20 years of its \u2018Campaign for Real Beauty.\u2019\n\nWhat key trends do you foresee defining the industry in 2025?\n\nMark Green, global chief executive officer: Fighting evil in the algorithm. As content becomes increasingly polarized, brands will have to fight the urge to settle in the middle and play it safe. Growth for brands will be in unifying, not dividing.\n\nThe creative differentiator. Creativity will increasingly be the differentiation in business as new ideas are copied and replicated as quickly as DeepSeek, for example. Therefore, the power of brand becomes more crucial.\n\nHigher-order creativity. While robots and AI will transform jobs, industries and indeed advertising, human empathy and higher-order creativity will be the saviors. They were, are and will be the answer to growth.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nGreen: A truly global Droga5 \u2013 fueled by borderless creativity and a renewed creative ambition \u2013 will be an even more powerful weapon as we continue pushing our creative boundaries further and beyond advertising. We firmly believe our best work is ahead of us. We have an exciting group of leaders that have the ambition to take creativity much further than advertising and we have a unique relationship with Accenture that brings the best of creativity, technology and consulting together. We have also learned a lot from successes and failures in equal measure and will now put this to work in the best way possible. New offices, new leaders and exciting new work will be the result.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nGreen: Dove\u2019s \u2018The Code\u2019: To celebrate 20 years of its pioneering \u2018Campaign for Real Beauty,\u2019 Dove partnered with Droga5 S\u00e3o Paulo to reinforce its commitment to real beauty. Vowing never to use AI to create or distort women\u2019s images, \u2018The Code\u2019 demonstrated how adding the phrase \u2018According to Dove Real Beauty campaign\u2019 to AI-generated prompts resulted in dramatically more diverse, inclusive, and authentic images. This sets a new standard for brands navigating evolving technology.\n\nSolament\u2019s \u2018The Down-Less Down Jacket\u2019: In Japan, Droga5 Tokyo applied a new technology and called it Solament, a unique material that absorbs near-infrared sunlight to generate heat and protect people from the cold. We then created the brand and developed a prototype for a transparent puffer jacket. This is a product and innovation going beyond advertising.\n\nSydney Opera House\u2019s \u2018Play It Safe\u2019: Celebrating 50 years, Droga5 Australia created a musical tribute to one of the world\u2019s most celebrated cultural landmarks, the Sydney Opera House. The musical created in collaboration with Tim Minchin reminded us of the power of creativity and its endless possibilities when you don\u2019t \u2018Play It Safe.\u2019 This is the power of entertainment for brands.\n\nBosch\u2019s \u2018#LikeABosch\u2019: Last summer, Bosch named Droga5 its US Agency of Record, tasked with ambitiously expanding Bosch\u2019s presence in the US market. Those ambitious plans with Droga5 include leading the German engineering and tech company to make its Super Bowl debut with an extension of Bosch\u2019s 2024 #LikeABosch platform.\n\nNRMA\u2019s \u2018A Help Company\u2019: Celebrating 100 years NRMA wanted to transform from an insurance company that helps people to a help company that does insurance. We created a new brand platform to deliver this message while also taking creativity further across digital channels, product design and service delivery. This is more than a marketing transformation but rather a wholesale customer transformation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe media agency had another award-laden year, the best yet in its 34-year history, picking up gongs at shows including The Drum Awards for Media and The Drum Awards for Marketing, including Gold in the Travel and Tourism category for its \u2018If You\u2019re Into It\u2019 campaign for The V&A.\n\nWhat key trends do you foresee defining the industry in 2025?\n\nPaul Knight, incoming CEO, PHD UK: In a market that is experiencing media fragmentation, asset fragmentation and capability fragmentation, marketers need 2025 to be the year where consumer experiences are better connected.\n\nThe agencies that will thrive in 2025 will be the ones that can best connect their talent, technology, and data to accelerate and elevate new solutions for clients and deliver better brand experiences for consumers.\n\nKey to this will be agencies\u2019 abilities to harness AI to improve efficiency in areas such as data distillation, audience pattern recognition and lateral thinking. We will also start to see the emergence of agentic AI, which acts autonomously on a user\u2019s behalf, completing complex tasks without prompting.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one thing that will continue to define the industry but isn\u2019t a new trend. When we get to the end of 2025, we will yet again be celebrating ingenious, creative thinking that creates real competitive advantage for clients. And long may that continue.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nSarah Nugent, managing director, PHD London: Following a year where we successfully retained \u00a3250m+ in incumbent pitches and added almost \u00a3150m of net new wins to our client list, we\u2019ve entered 2025 with significant business momentum and with Knighty\u2019s imminent arrival as CEO in February we are full of energy to bring PHD\u2019s new \u2018Intelligence. Connected\u2019 positioning to life in the work we do.\n\nWe exist to help clients Outthink, Outpace and Outgrow the competition so we will be continuing to prioritize the power of thinking to develop and grow new products and services that are designed to offer clients new solutions to new challenges, building on our recent successes in areas such as data consultancy and gaming.\n\nWe\u2019re already underway with this, having already launched a new UK cultural insight platform called Culture Currents, which unveiled new research into the importance of brands embracing optimism in a challenging macro-economic and political climate. There will be much more of that to come this year and as an agency, we\u2019re also massively optimistic about what 2025 will bring.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nEuan Hudghton, chief brand and experience officer, PHD UK: 2024 was a standout year for work at PHD UK, becoming the most awarded year in the agency\u2019s 34-year history, including winning five Grand Prix awards.\n\nAs importantly, our winning campaigns also reflected the breadth of work a modern media agency now needs to deliver for its clients. Work that was effective, creative, and inclusive.\n\nPHD clients won six IPA Effectiveness awards, including the Grand Prix for McCain.\n\nOur \u2018Streams of (un)consciousness\u2019 campaign for the British Heart Foundation flatlined the Twitch streams of 14 prominent gaming influencers to promote CPR training, directly leading to a life being saved.\n\nAward-winning campaigns for Andrex ranged from driving sales in new retail media spaces to partnering with ITV to redesign the Big Brother diary room chair made from toilet rolls.\n\nWe were also delighted to do our bit to make media more inclusive, brokering audio description and British Sign Language partnerships with ITV and Channel 4 for Guinness and Virgin Atlantic.\n\nAnd there\u2019ll be more of that kind of work to come in 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNils Leonard\u2019s hot shop continued to impress in 2024, its British Airways \u2018Windows\u2019 work picking up gongs at Cannes Lions and The Drum Awards for Advertising.\n\nUncommon\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nAI won\u2019t define 2025 \u2013 our reaction to it will. As AI mass-produces mediocrity, rare ideas, taste and beauty become more valuable. The industry\u2019s fear is misplaced; automation pushes creativity further.\n\nPolarization will shift from risk to strategy. Brands must take bold stands, leaving some behind while fostering loyal communities. Forget playing it safe \u2013 conviction and agitation will drive sharper, more meaningful work.\n\n2025 will be a landmark year for design. No longer just a backdrop, design itself will spark conversations, provoke reactions and shape brand narratives. Smart brands will harness its power for fame, engagement and cultural relevance.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWe\u2019re taking our design practice to the next level with more projects \u2013 off the back of the biggest rebrand in entertainment history for EA Sports FC and our disruptive graphic design system for Vimeo. As well as exploring new avenues including retail design \u2013 as we\u2019re set to redesign The Ordinary\u2019s store experience globally.\n\nArchitecture continues to be another area of growth in our founding partnership with Thomas Heatherwick\u2019s \u2018Humanise\u2019 movement. Last year, we launched UnLandmarks, a campaign using AI to reimagine iconic British buildings through the lens of monotonous architectural trends. The project is set to expand to the US in 2025.\n\nUnrest is an accelerator developing impact-led consumer brands. Based in our London studio since its inception, we can\u2019t wait to continue to cultivate this year\u2019s cohort as the program\u2019s continued brand partner.\n\nThis year also sees the launch of our third film feature, The Thing with Feathers, which premiered at Sundance 2025 with rave reviews, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and directed by Dylan Southern.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe redefined Christmas with JD Sports\u2019 #1 YouTube ad; launched Monzo\u2019s first brand campaign and ATMmm stunt, making it Marketing Society\u2019s Brand of the Year; crafted British Airways\u2019 Cannes-winning \u2018Windows\u2019 and viral safety video; made reference point B2B work with Hiscox helping the insurer reach record profits; designed the first-ever brand identity with resolution at its core for Vimeo; challenged beauty industry standards with provocative outdoor for The Ordinary speaking to the brand\u2019s philosophy of science over celebrity and celebrated Erling Haaland\u2019s quirks, challenging the serious nature of sports marketing with Beats \u2013 all combining creativity and effectiveness to pick up four Effies and continue to build brands the world wished existed.\n\nAn award-winning 2024 for the global media agency saw it pick up 10 trophies at The Drum Awards for Media, including the Chair\u2019s Award for its work with Transport for London.\n\nWavemaker\n\nWhat key trends do you foresee defining the industry in 2025?\n\nHow long is a piece of string? In such a fast-paced, constantly changing industry like ours, there\u2019s always something influencing or impacting it in any given year.\n\nRather than trends, I like to focus on what\u2019s keeping our clients awake at night or the things they are trying to navigate to deliver sustainable business growth \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s going to define the industry and what we need to do to adapt. I believe this year, there\u2019ll be three things frequenting our agenda.\n\nThe first is HFSS \u2013 in October this year we\u2019ll see the HFSS advertising legislation come into place. This isn\u2019t just going to impact HFSS brands; it\u2019s going to impact everyone \u2013 we\u2019ll see increased competition for premium inventory and in turn, an impact cost that\u2019s going to take some careful navigation to minimize the impact on ROI. The second is the \u2018messy middle\u2019; it\u2019s a topic that\u2019s never really gone away and one that clients and agencies have been navigating together, but I believe this year we\u2019ll see a renewed focus on working hard to maximize the power of the messy middle. And last but certainly not least is the intelligent use of AI (yes, it\u2019s being mentioned again!) in transforming creativity and problem-solving. It\u2019s definitely transforming how we operate as an agency, freeing up more space to focus on the client challenges that really need that human brain power.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nIt\u2019s an exciting time to be part of WPP and GroupM. With lots of new leadership in place and a whole new way of operating, our platform advances, product innovation and collaborative spirit are serving us well, making us all stronger. The power of the group and the broader network is really enabling all of us at Wavemaker to live and breathe positive provocation, so I think you\u2019ll see a renewed energy from us this year in really provoking the industry and demonstrating what sets us apart as an agency. It\u2019s that positively provocative spirit that really gives us the focus on creating unrivaled work; I\u2019m confident that you\u2019re going to be seeing it in spades from Wavemaker UK in 2025.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nOh, blimey, this is a bit like having to pick a favorite child! I\u2019m incredibly proud of all our client work in 2024 - we really did see a step change in the volume of unrivaled work we were creating, powered by some great agency-wide initiatives that galvanized everyone behind the work. Some of the standout campaigns include \u2018Bonjour, Hello, Ciao, Ola, Konichiwa!\u2019 for TfL, where we combined real-time train and flight data into a globally recognized DOOH campaign for the Elizabeth Line; our groundbreaking activation for Paramount that transformed Piccadilly Lights into an ancient stone mosaic for Gladiator II; and our UnXpected FM campaign for the UK Government which tackled road safety in an authentic and impactful way.\n\nI\u2019m also really proud of our partnership with Morrisons, which shines a light on what makes Morrisons unique, as well as our work in the data space with Merlin and William Hill that leveraged our proprietary technology \u2018Geograph\u2019 to deliver business impact for both businesses.\n\nIt\u2019s always great to look back, but I\u2019m super excited for what\u2019s in store for 2025 when it comes to the work\u2026 watch this space!\n\nThe B2B specialist won in the Media and Technology-Led Innovation categories at The Drum Awards for B2B 2024, with its work for Juniper Networks and Ecologi.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nCreativity as a strategic brand/business asset: Creativity in B2B has made giant strides in recent years. The momentum for higher-order creativity \u2013 creativity that serves as a strategic asset to move a business forward into the future \u2013 is now unstoppable.\n\nThe essential role of buying groups. Every B2B purchase of consequence involves a buying group. Functional \u201cpoint\u201d buyers. Anonymous buyers, Hidden buyers. Building brand availability and preference at \u2018day one\u2019 of the purchase process is the only way to create and cultivate demand. The understanding that buying groups are not monoliths \u2013 with advocates, antagonists and neutrals all present within the same buying group \u2013 will influence brand strategy and activation going forward.\n\nThe 95/5 rule will become more nuanced. Within the 95% of buyers who are not in-market at any given time, there is a cohort of 25%-30% that is edging closer to market. B2B marketers will develop specific strategies to engage these \u2018in-betweens\u2019 and follow them as they progress into and through the funnel.\n\nBDX as B2B\u2019s default go-to-market model: Truly unified brand-to-demand marketing will become the rule rather than the exception. Brands will gain maturity by applying the Brand-to-Demand Experience (BDX) model. From organizational structures to omnichannel creative platforms to orchestration platforms, BDX will move to underpin effective B2B marketing.\n\nThe re-definition of the role of brand in B2B. In-market, out-of-market and in between. Top, middle and bottom of funnel. Brand\u2019s multiplier effect on performance marketing. The magnitude and expansiveness of brand\u2019s role in driving demand and growth is becoming a mainstream B2B belief. Brand investment will grow in turn because it must.\n\nAI will move from hype to focused, strategic reality. While experimentation will continue for years, as will the AI arms race, marketers and agencies will focus on a core set of use cases that go beyond tactical enhancements to play a strategic role in all areas of value delivery.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWith new global CEO Kate MacNevin now at the helm, Stein IAS is continuing its growth journey and increasing its growth trajectory. Stein\u2019s positioning \u2013 Building the World\u2019s Most Demanded B2B Brands \u2013 connects the agency to the most consequential brands globally. Our Brand-to-Demand Experience (BDX) framework released at Cannes addresses the most critical challenge faced by B2B marketers \u2013 building brand strength in order drive demand strength and sustainable growth. As we scale BDX, we anticipate senior hires across the agency, particularly in creative, strategy and business leadership.\n\nIn 2025 and beyond, Stein IAS will continue to lead the industry BDX agenda by: launching the first B2B brand-to-demand maturity study, including industry perspectives on media allocation; partnering with LinkedIn, IAA, ANA and the ANA Lions CMO Growth Council to develop a Future of B2B Buying model; partnering with Brand Finance on the 2025 Most Valuable B2B Brands Index, focusing on the imperative for B2B enterprises to invest in brand to accelerate growth and build enterprise value; partnering strategically with ecosystem leaders, including LinkedIn and 6sense, to unify brand and demand and up-level effectiveness and efficiency for the world\u2019s B2B brands; and launching v2 of our proprietary Origin data platform that leverages AI and direct feeds from LinkedIn\u2019s APIs to develop more relevant and actionable personas, audiences, messaging and content, richer segmentation, and more effective media planning and activation.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nThe Mack Trucks \u2018By America\u2019s Side\u2019 campaign reconnected the soul of the iconic Mack Trucks brand with truck/fleet owners and operators. While the audience\u2019s affinity with Mack is considerable going back many years, it had lessened over time and needed to be strengthened anew in a highly competitive market. To accomplish this, we brought Mack back \u2013 the famous bulldog mascot that adorns the hood of every Mack truck \u2013 and made him the centerpiece of the campaign focused on Mack\u2019s role in helping to build America for 125 years.\n\nWe worked with Juniper Networks to progress its brand-to-demand marketing, driving performance and efficiency. \u2018The Now Way To Network\u2019 campaign positioned Juniper\u2019s first-mover, AI-native enterprise networking solutions, driving brand salience and connecting top-of-funnel to pipeline through highly orchestrated customer journeys across lines of business. Along the way, Juniper and Stein won an ANA B2 Awards Gold for Multi-Year Impact and our first-ever ARF David Ogilvy Award.\n\nIn introducing the new Elimini carbon removals brand (launched by global biomass leader Drax), Stein IAS and MSQ partner agencies The Gate and MMT needed to build category awareness, brand awareness and brand credibility, all while driving immediate demand. Our \u2018Removing Carbon for Good\u2019 brand-to-demand campaign added urgency and immediacy to the carbon removal conversation, establishing Elimini as a market leader and initiating a pipeline of enterprise customers ready to act."

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nWeb Client Runtime Security (WCRS) refers to the security or behavior of the code executed in users' internet browsers during their web interactions.\n\nThe first part of this series discussed why WCRS as a security discipline warrants specific attention in addition to traditional web application security solutions. The second article covered the limitations of traditional security solutions in addressing WCRS risk and proposed implementation options in terms of newer security mechanisms or solutions. This third and final article includes seven suggested steps or activities that organizations may find useful in operationalizing their WCRS programs or capabilities. These steps should provide a potential roadmap for organizations to obtain meaningful outcomes from WCRS solution implementation efforts.\n\nStep 1: Discovery\n\nThe first step in implementing WCRS solutions is to conduct a thorough discovery phase including all web applications and their associated third-party scripts. This involves creating an inventory of web assets and mapping out all dependencies, including those introduced by third-party services. By understanding the full scope of the application environment, organizations can identify key web applications that need to be protected and prioritize security efforts accordingly. The discovery phase is critical as it sets the foundation for subsequent steps and ensures that no critical assets are overlooked and left unprotected. The main objective of this step is to identify all web applications and monitoring requirements.\n\nThis effort could leverage configuration management databases (CMDB) as a starting point. However, it may be the case that some CMDB systems may not always yield accurate and up-to-date information. Implementation teams may therefore need to perform domain name system (DNS) and IP-based discovery against internet and intranet networks as such actions can uncover additional undocumented applications that may require protection.\n\nBy understanding the full scope of the application environment, organizations can identify key web applications that need to be protected and prioritize security efforts accordingly.\n\nStep 2: Prioritization of Web Applications\n\nWhen the discovery phase is complete, organizations should prioritize web applications for WCRS monitoring based on their risk profile. Factors such as the sensitivity of data handled, the volume of user traffic, and the criticality of the application to business operations should be considered. High-risk applications should receive immediate attention, while lower-risk applications can be addressed in a phased manner. This prioritization ensures that resources are allocated effectively, initially focusing on the most critical areas to maximize security impact.\n\nStep 3: Justification and Minimization of Third-Party Scripts\n\nOrganizations should assess the necessity of each third-party script and remove or replace those that are non-essential or pose significant risk. In other words, organizations should prioritize minimizing their attack surface, as reducing the attack surface is a key aspect of WCRS. This involves evaluating the functionality provided by third-party scripts against their security implications and seeking alternative solutions where possible. By minimizing the use of third-party scripts, organizations can reduce the likelihood of vulnerabilities being introduced and improve overall security.\n\nStep 4: Policy Development\n\nOrganizations should establish policies designed to block unwanted scripts and behaviors by implementing automated technical controls, such as WCRS vendor solution policies, content security policies,1 sub-resource integrity checks,2 and other security measures. Vendor solutions that enable behavior-based policies should be leveraged to reduce high-risk behaviors, such as keystroke logging and limiting access to sensitive data fields to a specific group of trusted scripts. These policies should be designed to balance security with operational needs, ensuring that legitimate business activities are not disrupted. Regular reviews and updates to these policies are necessary to adapt to evolving threats and changes in the web application environment.\n\nStep 5: Alerts and Response to Changes\n\nTimely detection and response to security incidents are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture. Organizations should implement mechanisms for real-time alerting and monitoring of changes to client-side scripts and behaviors. This involves adapting security policies to reduce false positives and ensuring that the volume of alerts received by security operations staff is commensurate with the size of their team. Clear response protocols and escalation paths should also be established, enabling security teams to quickly address incidents and mitigate potential risk. Last, it is important to ensure continuous monitoring and adaptation of these processes in order to maintain an effective security response over time.\n\nStep 6: Third-Party Risk Management\n\nManaging risk associated with third-party scripts requires close collaboration with vendors and adherence to regulatory guidelines. Organizations with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance obligations should follow the latest PCI requirements3 and guidance on engaging third parties for script integrity checking and ensure that vendors are aware of their impact on security. On 1 August 2019, the PCI Security Standards Council issued a bulletin4 addressing the threat of online skimming to payment security. This bulletin underscores the critical need for third parties to understand their role in securing payment pages, a message that remains highly relevant for organizations today. Additionally, organizations should refer to guidance from the US Office for Civil Rights (OCR) regarding the protection of protected health information (PHI).5 By maintaining robust third-party risk management practices, organizations can ensure that their security measures extend beyond their infrastructure.\n\nStep 7: Governance and Accountability\n\nEstablishing a governance framework and regular reporting mechanisms is essential for maintaining oversight and accountability for WCRS efforts. This involves defining roles and responsibilities, setting security objectives, and tracking progress against these goals. Regular reporting to stakeholders provides visibility into the effectiveness of security measures and highlights areas for improvement. Continuous improvement processes should be implemented to allow security practices to evolve in response to emerging threats and changes in the regulatory landscape. By maintaining strong governance and reporting structures, organizations can ensure that WCRS remains a priority and is effectively managed over time.\n\nOrganizations should consider implementing governance dashboards, such as the one shown in figure 1. These dashboards may include click-through functionality, allowing stakeholders such as line of business (LOB) and technology (LOT) owners and information security, compliance, and internal audit teams to readily review the underlying information or data for their respective needs.\n\nFigure 1\u2014Example WCRS Dashboard\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWCRS is crucial for any website utilizing third-party code. Given the increasing complexity and functionality of modern websites, it is nearly impossible for commercial sites to avoid the use of third-party code during client interactions. As a result, ensuring robust WCRS measures is essential for maintaining website security.\n\nThe authors hope that the solutions covered in the second article of this series, along with the operationalization strategies outlined in this final installment, offer readers comprehensive guidance regarding the next steps for implementation within their respective organizations.\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Mozilla Foundation, \u201cContent Security Policy (CSP),\u201d 10 January 2017\n\n2 Mozilla Foundation, \u201cSubresource Integrity,\u201d 21 September 2015\n\n3 PCI Security Standards Council, PCI DSS: v4.0.1\n\n4 PCI Security Standards Council, \u201cThe Threat of Online Skimming to Payment Security,\u201d 1 August 2019\n\n5 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cUse of Online Tracking Technologies by HIPAA Covered Entities and Business Associates,\u201d USA, 1 December 2022\n\nSergei Vasilevsky, CISSP\n\nIs the founder and president of ILIAM Consulting.

            "article_content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nLike most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface \u2014 even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.\n\nThe mantle, a zone between our planet\u2019s thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended. But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.\n\nAmong the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous \u201csupercontinents\u201d buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates. One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean. Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet\u2019s mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn\u2019t as well-stirred by Earth\u2019s internal churning as once believed. And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature.\n\n\u201cThese findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,\u201d said Claire Richardson, a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.\n\n\u201cResolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,\u201d Richardson told CNN in an email. \u201cOpen questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what\u2019s really going on down there.\u201d\n\nClues revealed by waves\n\nResearchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet. When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth\u2019s deep interior.\n\nOver the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary. Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall. However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza, lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\n\n\u201cTheir origin and whether they are long-lived structures \u2014 it\u2019s widely debated,\u201d Talavera-Soza said.\n\nEarth maps in the top row show the positions of two buried supercontinents \u2014 also called large low shear velocity provinces or LLSVPs \u2014 and how they affect speed and attenuation, or damping, of seismic waves. The bottom row shows the same LLSVPs in a cross-section view of Earth. Utrecht University\n\nEarlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents. This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.\n\nVelocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said. But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions. Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were \u201ckind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss, a professor of structure and composition of Earth\u2019s deep interior at Utrecht University.\n\n\u201cThere was no information about that,\u201d Deuss said. \u201cWe only knew that seismic waves slowed down.\u201d\n\nIn the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones\u2019 composition and activity. They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.\n\nIn music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said. Examining the attenuation of the waves \u2014 along with changes in wave speed \u2014 could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs\u2019 makeup. The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.\n\nWave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics. Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave\u2019s energy.\n\nOlder than \u2018slab graveyards\u2019\n\nThe researchers' findings could transform the understanding of plate tectonics. Here, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake leaves devastation in the Noto region of Japan's Ishikawa prefecture in January 2024. Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOther studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle. Around them were \u201cslab graveyards\u201d of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said. They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.\n\nHowever, the new model showed that while seismic waves\u2019 velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn\u2019t lose much energy. By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.\n\nResearchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures. Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time. Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study. Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.\n\n\u201cOur study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. \u201cThis implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.\u201d\n\nThis discovery follows another recent revelation about even more \u201csunken worlds\u201d that contradict the notion of a blended mantle. Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth\u2019s subduction zones \u2014 regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other. But earlier this year, another team of scientists identified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents\u2019 interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.\n\n\u201cApparently, such zones in the Earth\u2019s mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,\u201d said Thomas Schouten, lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in a statement.\n\nThe model in the new study \u2014 the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle \u2014 will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth\u2019s surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.\n\n\u201cIt maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth\u2019s interior,\u201d she said.\n\nThe findings could transform researchers\u2019 understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth\u2019s core, Deuss said. Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.\n\n\u201cThese LLSVPs have been there for a long time \u2014 if they\u2019ve been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years. They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located. We can\u2019t prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,\u201d Deuss said.\n\n\u201cFrom this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.\u201d\n\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine."

The same can be said even at the microscopic level of a \u201cnanoflower,\u201d compound combinations in chemistry that grow to form plantlike shapes. With this in mind, a research team based at Italy\u2019s University of Genoa have designed a novel nanostructure that relies on carnation-like nanoflowers containing enough surface area to host numerous wound-healing drug molecules.\n\nThe medical innovation is detailed in a study published in the journal ACS Applied Bio Materials. According to its creators, the bandage prototype uses two polyphenol-based materials\u2013copper phosphate and tannic acid. These reagents possess well-documented anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. Once mixed and placed in a saline solution, the copper phosphate-tannic acid compounds begin to self-assemble and grow into recognizable, flower-like structures. From there, researchers then carefully attached these nanoflowers on small strips of electrospun nanofabric.\n\n\u201cPolyphenols, natural compounds abundant in phenolic structures, have received widespread attention due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anticancer properties, making them valuable for biomedical applications,\u201d the team wrote in their study. \u201cHowever, the green synthesis of polyphenol-based materials with economical and environmentally friendly strategies is of great significance.\u201d\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

The possible benefits from nanoflowers aren\u2019t limited to medicine, either. Another study, published in October 2024 in Advanced Materials, points to uses across real-time imaging, wastewater purification, and even microrobotics."

            "article_content": "Experts believe they have finally found the last Anglo-Saxon king's residence\n\nArchaeologists have made a stunning breakthrough after discovering an 11th Centry medieval toilet that has helped to unravel a 2,000-year-old mystery. Researchers from the University of Exeter and the University of Newcastle believe they have uncovered Harold Godwinson, the last Saxon king of England\u2019s long-lost residence. Experts had until now been unable to pinpoint the exact location of King Harold\u2019s residence in Bosham. Illustrations of the grand hall in his residence appear twice in an 11th-century embroidered work known as the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts events leading up to the 1066 Norman Conquest of England. The tapestry shows Harold feasting in a grand hall before sailing to France. While the church in Bosham still stands today, experts have been left baffled by the hall's exact location.\n\nA The tapestry shows Harold seen feasting in a grand hall before sailing to France.\n\nHowever, researchers' re-examining evidence found in 2006 by West Sussex Archaeology led to a stunning revelation. The initial 2006 investigation located two previously unidentified medieval structures at the site. One structure is built into a modern-day private residence, and the other was found in the property's garden. Dr. Duncan Wright, Senior Lecturer in Medieval Archaeology at Newcastle University and project leader, said a toilet from the period found in the building offered a vital clue. While having a toilet in your home is practically a given in every household today, they were typically only found in high-status and elite residences in England during the 10th and 11th centuries.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Camera specification Main camera Wide-angle camera Telephoto Night mode Photo editing and AI The Galaxy S25 Ultra beats the iPhone\n\nWould it be right if we didn\u2019t put the latest Samsung Galaxy S series against the latest iPhone in a camera test? We don\u2019t think so, which is why we\u2019ve been out taking photos with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max to see which one has the best camera.\n\nCamera specification\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s camera has the same 200-megapixel main camera, 50MP telephoto for 5x optical zoom, and 10MP telephoto for 3x optical zoom as the Galaxy S24 Ultra. What\u2019s new, outside of the processor and software driving it, is a new 50MP wide-angle camera. Samsung has collaborated with Qualcomm on a special Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor and uses plenty of AI in the camera for improved results.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nA 48MP main camera heads the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s camera setup, and it\u2019s joined by a 12MP telephoto for a 5x optical zoom, and a 48MP wide-angle camera. Apple\u2019s own A18 Pro processor powers it, and both phones make use of optical image stabilization across the main and telephoto cameras. While it was the 16 Pro Max tested here, the camera is the same as the smaller iPhone 16 Pro, so the results should apply to it too.\n\nMain camera\n\nThe main camera is the one you\u2019re going to use the most, and throughout my time taking photos with both, there has been one overriding quality difference between them \u2014 sharpness. It comes down in the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s favor, as there\u2019s a continued hint of blur and fuzz in the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s photos.\n\nIt\u2019s most noticeable when you crop an image, but as it\u2019s there, the keen-eyed may spot it without getting up close and personal. The photo of the church is a good example, as the stone walls and tiled roof aren\u2019t as pin sharp in the S5 Ultra\u2019s photo, and although I prefer the way it has exposed the shot, the iPhone\u2019s colors are more vibrant and natural.\n\nThe iPhone\u2019s main camera also always generates a more pleasing depth of field around its subject, while the Galaxy S25 Ultra keeps more of the scene in focus. I tapped to focus on the hot water bottle sign in this photo, and the iPhone makes it clear this was my intention, while the S25 Ultra does not. I prefer being able to frame a shot like this, and find the S25 Ultra\u2019s photos can be quite \u201cflat.\u201d However, some may prefer the S25 Ultra\u2019s wider focal point.\n\nIn a photo taken in a flower shop, you can see the two treat colors in a similar way without oversaturating the scene, but the iPhone\u2019s generally sharper photo with its warmer tone is more pleasing. The two cameras never seem to quite get the white balance right, and both lack consistency here. However, in general, while I\u2019ve liked photos taken with both phones, the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s sharper images are my preference.\n\nWinner: Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nWide-angle camera\n\nThis is where the Galaxy S25 Ultra needs to shine, as the wide-angle camera is the only hardware difference between it and the S24 Ultra. Compared to the iPhone 16 Pro Max, it\u2019s definitely an improvement, with richer colors and more accurate exposure, but it\u2019s not perfect and there\u2019s still work to be done.\n\nThe wide view of a vineyard shows Samsung has amped up the colors but sensibly used the exposure to not make the scene too unrealistic. The iPhone\u2019s exposure washes the foreground out too much, despite showing a little more detail in the shadows. The Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s photo is quite heavy-handed with its smoothing though, but the detail in the far distance is less hazy than the iPhone.\n\nThere\u2019s a massive difference in tone too, as you can see in this photo of a bridge over a lake. I don\u2019t hate the iPhone\u2019s treatment of the scene, but it\u2019s far from realistic, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra captures it really well. The S25 Ultra\u2019s smoothing works in its favor, avoiding the harsh pixelation found in the iPhone\u2019s photo when you crop it down, but I\u2019d like to see it toned down in future software updates.\n\nOur final wide-angle photo, taken on the same day as the one above, shows the S25 Ultra\u2019s realism and accurate colors, and the amount of additional detail its photos contain. The trees in the background are in sharp focus, while the iPhone\u2019s background are blurred. It\u2019s the same situation with the water. The Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s wide-angle camera easily takes the win here.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\n\nTelephoto\n\nThe telephoto camera was always the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s thing, but this has slowly changed as other brands have caught up, and Samsung itself abandoned the S-series\u2019 defining 10x optical in favor of a hybrid 10x. The camera provides an array of shortcuts \u2014 2x, 3x, 5x, and 10x \u2014 but only 3x and 5x are optical. The iPhone\u2019s camera app shows a 2x, and 5x shortcut, and both are optical zooms.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the 5x zoom first, as this is where both cameras technically match. Straight away the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s white balance is more accurate, and along with the punchier reds and greens, the photo pops more than the iPhone\u2019s image. Crop it down and there\u2019s more detail and less noise from the S25 Ultra too.\n\nHow about 10x? The Galaxy S25 Ultra has the iPhone beaten here too, with less noise (but more smoothing, which may upset some) and sharper focus in its 10x photos, but it\u2019s quite a close thing. You really notice the differences when you examine the photos closely or crop them down. At first glance, the iPhone 16 Pro Max does a very good job at a zoom range it\u2019s not supposed to provide, and it\u2019s still surprisingly usable.\n\nUse the 2x on the iPhone and the 3x on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and not much changes. This lowlight shot shows both handle exposure and tone in a similar way, but there\u2019s a lot more grain in the iPhone\u2019s photo, and the S25 Ultra takes the sharper photo, opposite to how the main cameras performed. The iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s telephoto ability is decent, but it can\u2019t match the Samsung phone.\n\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\n\nNight mode\n\nBefore getting started with the photos, it\u2019s worth mentioning the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s incredibly dark on-screen preview for lowlight images, which makes you think the photo isn\u2019t going to come out. Luckily, it is not representative of the end result. The iPhone\u2019s previews are exactly like the final photo and generally, the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s lowlight photos are warmer than the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s photos, which border on harsh sometimes, as you can see in the first photo.\n\nBoth can struggle with noise, which the S25 Ultra compensates for with more smoothing than the iPhone. Neither is preferable, but it can make Samsung\u2019s photos look more polished at a glance. However, when you crop the images down both photos have the same level of detail.\n\nThe final photo shows the slight differences between the two cameras in low light, and neither is really better than the other, revealing similar levels of detail, and maintaining basically the same colors and tone. Only marginal exposure changes are visible, which don\u2019t affect the overall look of the photo. Both are very good in low light.\n\nWinner: draw\n\nPhoto editing and AI\n\nBoth smartphones feature extensive photo editing capabilities. The iPhone\u2019s Photographic Styles are available \u201clive\u201d and can be changed after you\u2019ve taken the photo, but only if you\u2019re saving images in the HEIF format. Samsung\u2019s interpretation is more flexible. A range of filters are available in the editing app, more can be downloaded from the Galaxy Store, and I like the way it has added granular editing using sliders. It\u2019s more intuitive than Apple\u2019s system, and can really change the way a photo looks.\n\nBoth use AI to change photos. Apple has its Playground app, while Samsung adds its AI into the Gallery app, and its Sketch to Image feature is a fun addition, where the AI adds an element to a photo based on your own basic sketch. Lightroom is also available for both operating systems, and there aren\u2019t obvious differences in the way they operate, and a subscription is needed to access in-depth features.\n\nBoth editing suites are feature-packed and relatively easy to use. It\u2019s simple to change the look of your photos, but the AI features are gimmicks used solely for fun, and I doubt many people will consistently use them.\n\nWinner: draw\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra beats the iPhone\n\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra has beaten the iPhone 16 Pro Max in our camera comparison, despite losing in the critical main camera category. This causes some problems, as the main camera is likely the one everyone will use the most, and therefore the quality here will be most important. I\u2019m not taking anything away from the Galaxy S25 Ultra, as it\u2019s obvious it has the superior wide-angle and telephoto cameras, but if you rarely use either of them, the iPhone 16 Pro Max may be the better choice.\n\nHowever, taken as an overall camera system \u2014 which is what this test is about \u2014 the Galaxy S25 Ultra is more versatile, and goes on to equal the iPhone 16 Pro Max in every other category. It\u2019s a worthy winner."

            "article_content": "As financial crime risks evolve, including those risks posed by the use of AI and other emerging technologies, so too must firms\u2019 financial crime compliance response. It is unsurprising, therefore, that AI forms part of both the problem and the solution. Accompanied by a governance model that has a \u201chuman in the loop\u201d component, AI-enabled solutions can support more efficient and effective systems and controls for the prevention of financial crime risks. In this article we explore the current use of AI to combat financial crime and what lies ahead for firms using third parties to comply with their obligations in this area.\n\nAI-enabled financial crime compliance\n\nAI continues to dominate both professional and private conversation.The financial services sector have been early adopters to the technology, using AI widely, including within their risk and compliance functions.AI\u2019s role in fraud detection and prevention has developed rapidly: the Bank of England and FCA\u2019s third survey of AI and machine learning in UK financial services revealed that it is the third highest use case in financial services and is expected to increase in the next 3 years. Additionally, customer due diligence and transaction monitoring are two areas where AI can deliver significant operational efficiencies.\n\nWhat is driving this trend? Financial crime plainly remains one of the most significant risks facing financial services firms and remains firmly within the regulator\u2019s focus \u2013 tackling financial crime is one of the main objectives in the FCA\u2019s new 5-year strategy 2025-2030. Firms are significantly motivated to adopt more sophisticated and dynamic ways to protect against financial crime risks, which AI-enabled tools offer.\n\nRecent examples of the use of AI in this area are real success stories. AI-enabled tools have been used to:\n\nHowever, these AI-enabled tools are inherently complex, requiring considerable resource and extensive market data to develop and maintain. Third-party providers of AI enabled tools designed to detect and combat financial crime have emerged, raising important questions of governance, accountability, expertise and, ultimately, regulatory compliance.\n\nThe Reliance on Third Parties A third of all current AI use cases deployed by respondents to the regulators\u2019 AI survey are third-party implementations, up from 17% in the regulators\u2019 equivalent 2022 survey. Risk and compliance was the business area with the second highest percentage of third-party implementations (64%), narrowly behind usage in HR (65%). The regulators anticipate that the use of third-party implementations will increase as AI models become more complex and outsourcing costs decrease. Coupled with the likely increased reliance on third party providers in AI use, evidence suggests that firms have an inadequate understanding of how outsourced systems operate and are trained. For example, almost 50% of respondents in the Bank of England\u2019s survey reported having only a partial understanding of the AI technologies they use, admitting \u201ca lack of complete understanding\u201d where these technologies are developed by third parties rather than internally. This is problematic given the regulatory requirements governing the oversight of outsourced functions, which includes use of third party AI tools. Such oversight cannot be properly exercised where the host firm does not understand the system. Firms will need to consider how the fundamental differences in AI, compared with algorithmic models before it, impact the discharge of their responsibilities. Whist the typical safeguards contained in an outsourcing agreement, i.e. provisions that stipulate audit rights and business continuity arrangements, may mitigate emergent risks in the area, a new suite of protective solutions and governance arrangements will be required. This need is particularly apparent in respect of data. AI-enabled tools that rely on poor quality or incomplete data will, necessarily, produce poor quality outcomes. Data governance and standards have never been more important and will be a fast-developing field in the context of AI models. Similarly, firms will need to implement measures to protect against third party models generating biased results, a likely focus of regulatory concern. The FCA has cautioned that firms using AI-enabled tools should consider whether they may lead to worse outcomes for some groups of consumers, in breach of the Consumer Duty, due to these technologies embedding or amplifying bias. Bias can occur at any point from the creation of the algorithm to its deployment. Incorrect problem-framing or reliance on datasets that are not representative of the firms\u2019 customer demographic will result in an inherently biased learning process and discriminatory outputs. Use of third-party models that rely on market-wide transfer learning in risk detection (i.e. leveraging pre-existing models trained on large financial datasets) may exacerbate this problem. The use of third-party AI models may also present an accountability challenge, if not deficit, especially where the developers and providers are outside of the regulatory perimeter. Failures connected with the operation of financial crime systems and controls have already been a significant focus of regulatory enforcement action. The FCA\u2019s issuance of Final Notices to Metro Bank Plc and Starling Bank Ltd in late 2024 are stark examples. However, there have not been any related actions taken against Senior Managers, which may speak to the evidential challenges presented by such cases. Whilst, establishing individual accountability may become more difficult in respect of AI systems which have a significant third party component, regulators may closely scrutinise firms\u2019 standards of governance and oversight. Firms will need to have staff with the requisite expertise and training, to ensure that auditing and oversight of the models, and their development, can be monitored effectively. They will also need to assess the appropriate extent to which \u201chumans in the loop\u201d should be incorporated into the operation of the model, i.e. where does the appropriate balance between efficiency and protection lie? Should failings emerge, unravelling what went wrong and who was ultimately responsible will be challenging due to the complexity of the models and number of parties feeding into the systems. Firms will need to be able to explain, in a meaningful way, the machine learning model and any resulting decisions, especially if they lead to consumer harm. Firms need also to design and implement feedback mechanisms to detect and prevent model drift, and enable prompt reaction to bias or new threats. These are significant questions, which will require input at a Board level. Where an unacceptable accountability deficit emerges, the Regulator may shift its focus on the governance arrangements in firms, instead casting its perimeter wider, to include third party providers of AI financial crime systems within the regulatory fold. This has already been done in respect of critical third party providers, who supply material services to financial sector. That approach may be rolled out in other areas in which the industry\u2019s dependence on third party providers for complex AI systems becomes entrenched."

            "article_content": "In this Pharmaceutical Executive video interview, Dr. Shakthi Kumar, Chief Strategy and Business Officer, EDETEK, Inc. further explores the company's launch of R&D Cloud, emphasizing the platform's open API access, extensive library of pre-built connectors for various data sources, and real-time data and workflow capabilities.\n\nHe highlights key differentiators including the breadth and depth of integrated capabilities (covering the entire clinical trial lifecycle), robust workflow and event management, multi-SSO integration, and a state-of-the-art cloud architecture.\n\nFuture development plans include incorporating AI, expanding connectors, and specializing in additional therapeutic areas. Ultimately, the R&D Cloud aims to provide cost reduction, improved business outcomes (faster trials, real-time insights), and enhanced data quality and compliance for clients.\n\nA transcription of the conversation is available below.\n\nThe press release emphasizes the R&D Cloud's flexibility and ability to be customized. Can you elaborate on how clients can tailor their R&D Cloud environment to their specific needs and the level of control they have over the selection and integration of third-party software?\n\nIn today's rapidly evolving pharmaceutical landscape, the shift from one size fits all products and restrictive platforms to more collaborative ecosystems is truly transmitted, and many of our clients also emphasize the need for best-in-class collaboration and synergistic integration of different capabilities. At EDETEK, we've recognized this through our R&D Cloud, and it's built on two of our flagship platforms. It's eClinical for clinical trial design, execution and management and CONFORM\u2122, which is our clinical data management, aggregation, standardization and regulatory submission.\n\nClients have full flexibility in terms of selecting the capabilities they desire with either of our two platforms or with third-party software and edit tag provides the data integration and the plumbing, if you may, across the entire ecosystem, and that combined with our multi SSO integration and events driven system orchestration truly provides a very seamless collaboration and workflow, both data and human, across both internal external stakeholders, which we believe is the flexibility that the industry desires right now, and we're very excited about it.\n\nHow does the R&D Cloud address potential integration challenges and ensure seamless data flow and interoperability between different software components, both within the EDETEK ecosystem and with third-party solutions?\n\nOur R&D Cloud ecosystem is actually designed on four principles, and this is all keeping in mind the seamless data flow, the interoperability and the seamless orchestration that's desired. The first one is we make it easy for life sciences companies to integrate with various clinical sources. So how do we do this? We do this by providing an extensive library of ready to use connectors. In fact, we have over 80 different data sources that our entire R&D Cloud ecosystem right now is prebuilt, and this includes major EDC systems, central labs, imaging, PV, safety systems and various other clinical sources. All of this is facilitated through our data integration gateway, right so this makes integration much easier. It's prebuilt, and it's also very extensible.\n\nThe second one is the data and the human workflow. All of this is in real time. One is the challenges of getting data, but then the question becomes, what do you do with the data? So that has to do with collaboration and workflow, and we provide that in near real time. Our event and Collaboration Hub facilitates that particular functionality.\n\nThe third one is we provide public open API access. This is for integration and extension of our capabilities. Because, you know, when life sciences companies want to build their R&D environments, they want to build they want to tailor it, but they can also expand it, you know, working with other different partners, right? And so, the public open API access is a very important component.\n\nThe fourth one is extremely important. We call it any data, any source, any format. Our R&D Cloud provides a semantic level standardization of data, and the clients get the flexibility to customize that data models. They customize their structures with zero programming. It's all driven by metadata. And we believe that these design principles, along with a whole bunch of others, actually provides that flexibility for seamless data integration, for seamless, you know, workflow orchestration and truly building an ecosystem for our clients.\n\nWhat are the key differentiators of the EDETEK R&D Cloud compared to existing cloud-based clinical trial solutions offered by other companies in the market?\n\nWe have many key differentiators, but I'll highlight a few. The first is the breadth and depth of our capabilities I talked earlier about our two flagship platforms. Our R&D Cloud comes prebuilt with the entire suite of products for clinic, clinical trial design, execution and management, so systems like CTMS, ETMF, electronic patient reported outcomes, randomization and trial supply management, eConsent and so on. Our R&D Cloud comes prebuilt with these capabilities for clinical trial design and execution.\n\nOnce you collect the data, you also need the clinical data management and analytics capabilities that's still delivered through conform. We provide pretty much near time data collection, comprehensive data cleansing, standardization, automated, regulatory, data set generation and sophisticated visualization. And these are kind of like provides the execution part of it, and then what you really do with the data, right and the third level, which we're really excited about is because, you know, it's not just the technology our clients are looking for. They're also looking for domain specialization.\n\nWe have launched therapeutic area accelerators. For instance, a couple of months ago, we released ONCO+, which is a clinical trial accelerator just for oncology trials. And so, if you really look at it, it's not only the breadth, but also the depth and the specialization. So that's the first differentiator of the platform.\n\nThe second one, which we truly believe provides a very robust set of workflow and collaboration, is that the R&D Cloud. When you actually start building the ecosystems, you have different systems. You have different integration requirements. You have both workflow management and so on. We have an extensive set of capabilities for managing the event and the workflow within the R&D so what happens when a patient is enrolled in a particular site, you know, does it need to trigger off other events in the ecosystem, or when you collect the data, what kind of events does the R&D Cloud need to drive? And so, the event and collaboration workflow is a true differentiator and how it is actually built, because it can not only orchestrate events within our own product suite, but it can also do so for other third-party ones, right? The multi SSO integration extremely important security. Most major pharmaceutical companies, the clinical trials are running globally, and so you need to have the ability to provide that multi SSO integration across different regions, different types of user classes and groups and so on. So that actually comes, you know, pretty prebuilt within the R&D Cloud. So that is the second differentiator.\n\nThe third one is the R&D cloud is built on a state-of-the-art cloud architecture, and so there is no tying down the client to a specific environment. It's all there in cloud. I provide scalability, it provides security, reliability, speed of innovation and as well as compliance. So that's we believe makes it easier to incrementally layer our R&D Cloud into existing operating environments. And the fourth one is we provide a very intuitive, interactive visual platform. And the rule that we use is, you know, a user should be able to perform a particular function within two clicks within the entire system. We have taken care through human interface engineering that you know it is easy to use across both you know, specialized users as well as people that you know are using it for review and so on and so forth. So, we do believe that all these differentiators, along with some of the other ones will truly differentiate R&D Cloud today."

            "article_content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nLike most of us, Earth has a lot going on under the surface \u2014 even in what may have once seemed to be its most unassuming layer.\n\nThe mantle, a zone between our planet\u2019s thin crust and the molten core, features 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) of mostly solid rock, with a consistency like thickened caramel that scientists long hypothesized was uniformly blended. But massive unmixed regions have been found lingering in the mantle, like lumps of chocolate in a cookie, and new findings are just beginning to reveal their secrets.\n\nAmong the enigmatic mantle lumps are two enormous \u201csupercontinents\u201d buried thousands of kilometers below the crust amid the remains of ancient tectonic plates. One supercontinent lies under Africa, and the other resides deep under the Pacific Ocean. Using a new method to analyze data from earthquakes, researchers recently uncovered previously unknown details about these vast island regions, revealing that they may serve as anchors in our planet\u2019s mantle and that they could be much older than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the rocky mantle isn\u2019t as well-stirred by Earth\u2019s internal churning as once believed. And hidden structures or pockets of unblended material, such as these supercontinents, may shape mantle activity, including plate movement, in ways that are yet to be understood, scientists reported January 22 in the journal Nature.\n\n\u201cThese findings will contribute to a better understanding of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and, therefore, phenomena we experience at the surface like earthquakes and volcanism,\u201d said Claire Richardson, a doctoral candidate in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the new research.\n\n\u201cResolving the physical, thermal, and chemical properties of rocks ~3000 km (1,864 miles) below our feet, at extreme temperatures and pressures, is a challenging problem to say the least,\u201d Richardson told CNN in an email. \u201cOpen questions abound, and each new study gets us closer to understanding what\u2019s really going on down there.\u201d\n\nClues revealed by waves\n\nResearchers first spotted the subterranean supercontinents about 50 years ago when they popped up as anomalies in seismic data generated by earthquakes powerful enough to send reverberations through the planet. When seismic waves encounter unusual structures in the mantle, changes in wave speed provide seismologists with clues about Earth\u2019s deep interior.\n\nOver the decades, seismic data revealed that these supercontinents make up about 20% of the mantle-core boundary. Each of the buried islands covers hundreds of thousands of miles, and in some spots they tower nearly 600 miles (965 kilometers) tall. However, little was known about what they were made of, when they sank and what role they might play in mantle flow, known as convection, said Dr. Sujania Talavera-Soza, lead author of the new study and a geosciences and seismology researcher at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.\n\n\u201cTheir origin and whether they are long-lived structures \u2014 it\u2019s widely debated,\u201d Talavera-Soza said.\n\nEarth maps in the top row show the positions of two buried supercontinents \u2014 also called large low shear velocity provinces or LLSVPs \u2014 and how they affect speed and attenuation, or damping, of seismic waves. The bottom row shows the same LLSVPs in a cross-section view of Earth. Utrecht University\n\nEarlier research focused on the velocity of seismic waves, showing that wave speed slowed by about 2% upon arriving at the supercontinents. This slowing of seismic waves led geologists to name the regions large low shear velocity provinces, or LLSVPs.\n\nVelocity loss in seismic waves suggested that these mantle zones were hotter than the rocks around them, Talavera-Soza said. But it was unknown whether the LLSVPs differed structurally from nearby regions. Scientists were also uncertain whether the supercontinents were actively involved in convection, or if they were \u201ckind of dense piles that would just be sitting there,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Arwen Deuss, a professor of structure and composition of Earth\u2019s deep interior at Utrecht University.\n\n\u201cThere was no information about that,\u201d Deuss said. \u201cWe only knew that seismic waves slowed down.\u201d\n\nIn the new study, the authors used a different approach for studying the LLSVPs to see if they could tease out details about the zones\u2019 composition and activity. They looked at the attenuation, or intensity, of seismic signals as they traveled through the mantle to see how much energy the vibrations from quakes lost.\n\nIn music, attenuation is comparable to damping a tone, which produces a lower volume, Deuss said. Examining the attenuation of the waves \u2014 along with changes in wave speed \u2014 could provide previously unseen clues about LLSVPs\u2019 makeup. The best data for this is from waves produced by earthquakes that are magnitude 7.8 or higher, Talavera-Soza added.\n\nWave speed and energy loss were known to be affected by mineral grain size as well as temperature, so the authors used a physics model that linked seismology and mineral physics. Waves are damped more when they encounter material made of smaller grains; if lots of grains are packed together, there are more boundaries between the grains that can sap a wave\u2019s energy.\n\nOlder than \u2018slab graveyards\u2019\n\nThe researchers' findings could transform the understanding of plate tectonics. Here, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake leaves devastation in the Noto region of Japan's Ishikawa prefecture in January 2024. Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOther studies revealed that the supercontinents had company in the deep mantle. Around them were \u201cslab graveyards\u201d of sunken tectonic plates, Deuss said. They were cooler than the LLSVPs, so seismic waves moved through them more quickly.\n\nHowever, the new model showed that while seismic waves\u2019 velocity dipped when they reached LLSVPs, the waves didn\u2019t lose much energy. By comparison, there was significant damping among the cooler graveyards around the LLSVPs.\n\nResearchers believe those differences come down to the comparative ages of the structures. Over millions of years, as rocky material descends through the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, mineral crystals are compressed and reformed into tinier grains that then regrow over time. Younger regions therefore have smaller crystals, which suck more energy from seismic waves, so the amount of damping in a region hints at how old it is.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the LLSVPs show very little damping, means that they must consist of much larger grains than their surroundings,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. Larger mineral grains suggested that the supercontinents were significantly older than the tectonic graveyards around them, as their grains must have had more time to grow, according to the study. Larger building blocks would also make the supercontinents more rigid, keeping them separate from mantle convection, or movement of materials in that layer due to heat transfer.\n\n\u201cOur study points to the LLSVPs being long-lived features, at least half a billion years old, perhaps even older,\u201d Talavera-Soza said. \u201cThis implies they act as anchors at the base of the core-mantle boundary and have survived mantle convection, meaning that the mantle is not well-mixed.\u201d\n\nThis discovery follows another recent revelation about even more \u201csunken worlds\u201d that contradict the notion of a blended mantle. Buried plates in tectonic graveyards tend to accumulate in alignment with Earth\u2019s subduction zones \u2014 regions where the edges of two plates meet, and where one slides beneath the other. But earlier this year, another team of scientists identified sunken tectonic slabs far from these boundaries in locations under continents\u2019 interiors and beneath oceans, where sunken plates had never been found before.\n\n\u201cApparently, such zones in the Earth\u2019s mantle are much more widespread than previously thought,\u201d said Thomas Schouten, lead author of that investigation and a researcher at the Geological Institute of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in a statement.\n\nThe model in the new study \u2014 the first 3D attenuation model for the entire mantle \u2014 will help seismologists to better understand what lies thousands of kilometers below Earth\u2019s surface, said Richardson, the doctoral candidate.\n\n\u201cIt maps regions of the Earth that weaken seismic energy, ultimately affecting the measurements many seismologists use to understand other physical and chemical properties of Earth\u2019s interior,\u201d she said.\n\nThe findings could transform researchers\u2019 understanding of plate tectonics and how plate movement might be shaped by these ancient, fixed anchors near Earth\u2019s core, Deuss said. Further analysis of the supercontinents could also reveal if they are the source of geochemical elements nearly as old as Earth itself that are found in lava from certain types of volcanoes, she added.\n\n\u201cThese LLSVPs have been there for a long time \u2014 if they\u2019ve been there for a billion years, they might have also been there for 4 billion years. They might well be that hidden reservoir where these chemical primordial elements might be located. We can\u2019t prove that now, but geochemists can investigate this,\u201d Deuss said.\n\n\u201cFrom this study, I think there will be a lot of extra research that might answer a lot of outstanding questions that have been confusing scientists for ages.\u201d\n\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine."

            "article_content": "Confidential patient data, bank details and highly sensitive government and military information must be increasingly protected against eavesdropping and hacking. The necessary basis for this is provided by quantum physics, which goes far beyond conventional mathematical techniques for encryption.\n\nThis is because the unimaginably tiny world of quanta has its own rules: For example, the state of a particle often changes as soon as it is observed. This is ideal for quantum cryptography.\n\nLight-conducting core thinner than a hair\n\nThe Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) wants to advance the research and development of quantum networks. To this end, the university has had a 20-kilometre-long fiber optic test track laid between specially equipped laboratories on the South and North Campus.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson, it has a diameter of 125 micrometers, i.e. just over 0.01 centimeters. The light-conducting core is only around 9 micrometers thick. By comparison, a human hair is around 60 micrometers thick, according to the data.\n\nAccording to the KIT, so-called quantum keys, which are crucial for tap-proof communication, can be transmitted via the test track. And this, in turn, is of central importance for a networked society.\n\nThreat from quantum computers underestimated\n\n\u201cQuantum communication is a key technology for future security in data transmission,\u201d says the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. \u201cIt can protect against attacks using both modern computers and powerful quantum computers.\u201d\n\nThe background to this is that quantum computers work very differently to traditional computers \u2013 namely with so-called qubits. Like a bit in a classical computer, a qubit can be in the state 1 or 0 \u2013 but also simultaneously in the state 1 and 0 or in a theoretically infinite number of states in between.\n\nQuantum computers are therefore good at solving problems that are extremely difficult for classical computers. For example, they can better simulate complex chemical systems or calculate optimal routes more quickly.\n\nAgain, this makes it relatively easy to break previous encryptions that are based on mathematical assumptions. According to the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), the threat to information security posed by quantum computers is widely underestimated.\n\nResearch for the future quantum internet\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) emphasized the importance of such technologies in the autumn in Ehningen near Stuttgart at the opening of the first quantum computing center of the US technology group IBM in Europe. In such areas, he said, we should not be dependent on other countries.\n\nOver time, KIT would like to expand the new test track into a quantum network. With this help, scientists will be able to research elements of the future quantum internet.\n\nThe project is a central infrastructure of the \u201cChem4Quant\u201d Cluster of Excellence initiative. Researchers from KIT and the universities of Ulm and Stuttgart want to develop novel qubit materials and initial components for the quantum internet. \u201cWith chemically precisely definable quantum architectures, atomically precise material structures and their quantum properties can be specifically planned,\u201d they say. For example, qubits could be positioned in electrical components with a precision below the nanometer range.\n\nImportant breakthroughs achieved\n\nThe system is also important for research into so-called quantum repeaters. These are intended to enable the secure transmission of information over long distances \u2013 similar to WLAN repeaters.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Education and Research is funding a project launched at the beginning of January with a total of 20 million euros over three years. According to Saarland University, 42 research institutions and companies are working together to develop the basic building blocks of a quantum network structure based on quantum repeaters.\n\nAccording to the BSI, the main challenge with quantum computers is their susceptibility to errors: \u201cQuantum systems are very sensitive to interference and therefore require complex error correction, which is known as quantum error correction.\u201d Recently, there have been a wealth of developments in this area that could make a cryptanalytically relevant quantum computer possible in just under ten years.\n\ndpa"
