        "article_content": "There are eight endings to unlock in the remake of Silent Hill 2, with six classic endings returning and two new endings to experience.\n\nThe classic endings (Leave, In Water, and Maria) have the same basic triggers required to unlock them, with the biggest change being the item locations for the Dog, UFO, and Rebirth endings. The two new endings (Bliss and Stillness) have completely new items that you need to find and use in the correct places in order to unlock them.\n\nOur Silent Hill 2 endings guide details how to unlock all endings below, but do keep in mind that you need to have unlocked New Game Plus by completing the game once before you can get the majority of the endings in the Silent Hill 2 remake.\n\nPlease note that, as in the original, the Leave, In Water, and Maria endings seem to be primarily worked out through a point based system. This means that even if you follow our advice below, you could still get a different ending.\n\nOn this page:\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nHow to get Leave ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nLeave is the most common ending people get in Silent Hill 2 because it has the easiest triggers to activate. It's considered the 'good' ending because it gives a little hope for James' future. In short, to get this ending, you need to play like James actually wants to live. So healing quickly after being injured is the best way you can consistently work towards it.\n\nHere's how to get the Leave ending in Silent Hill 2:\n\nHeal right after James gets injured.\n\nPick the Snake Coin at the end of the Coin Cabinet puzzle.\n\nListen to Mary's entire sickbed speech in the long corridor near the very end of the game.\n\nDon't check on Maria at the hospital, or Labyrinth cell.\n\ncheck on Maria at the hospital, or Labyrinth cell. Don't investigate Angela's knife.\n\ninvestigate Angela's knife. Don't examine Mary's letter, photo, or Handkerchief more than once.\n\nIn our experience, healing right after James gets injured is almost a surefire way to get the Leave ending, if it's your first playthrough. We examined Mary's items, Angela's Knife, and checked on Maria - and we still got Leave.\n\nIt's also possible that the coin choice at the end of the Coin Cabinet puzzle in Wood Side Apartments doesn't affect the ending, but as you can pick from any of the three, it's best to pick a coin that might help you get the Leave ending, just in case.\n\nImage credit: Konami\n\nHow to get In Water ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nIn Water is another common ending, as its main trigger is also linked to James' health. You essentially need to play like James does not value his own life. So waiting a long time to heal - preferably when the screen has been red for a while - is the best way you can consistently work towards this ending.\n\nHere's how to get the In Water ending in Silent Hill 2:\n\nWait as long as possible before healing.\n\nPick the Man Coin at the end of the Coin Cabinet puzzle.\n\nExamine Angela's Knife at least twice.\n\nListen to Mary's entire sickbed speech in the long corridor near the very end of the game.\n\nDon't check on Maria at the hospital, or Labyrinth cell.\n\nAs we've said, it's possible that the coin choice at the end of the Coin Cabinet puzzle in Wood Side Apartments doesn't affect the ending, but as you can pick from any of the three, it's best to pick a coin that might help you get the In Water ending, just in case.\n\nImage credit: Konami / Bloober Team\n\nHow to get Maria ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nIn our experience, Maria is the most difficult ending to get in the Silent Hill 2 remake, unless you've already got the Leave and In Water endings. This is because it's not linked to health, so even if you give Maria all of the attention you need to help get her ending, your healing tactics are likely to give you Leave or In Water instead. Due to this, we recommend you unlock these regular endings first before attempting to get the Maria ending.\n\nWith this in mind, here's how to get the Maria ending in Silent Hill 2:\n\nPick the Woman Coin at the end of the Coin Cabinet puzzle.\n\nIf separated from Maria, unlock a door to reunite with her as soon as possible.\n\nFollow Maria to Jack's Inn immediately after leaving Rosewood Park with her (stick to the critical path until you enter Brookhaven Hospital).\n\nCheck on Maria multiple times at the hospital (at least after finding the Marked Bracelet, to trigger a cutscene).\n\nCheck on Maria multiple times while she's in the Labyrinth cell, and try to enter her cell again after she dies.\n\nDon't let Maria take damage.\n\nlet Maria take damage. Don't smash any glass around Maria, unless necessary.\n\nsmash any glass around Maria, unless necessary. Don't bump into Maria too much.\n\nbump into Maria too much. Don't examine Mary's letter, photo, or handkerchief.\n\nexamine Mary's letter, photo, or handkerchief. Don't examine Angela's Knife.\n\nexamine Angela's Knife. Don't bring your personal items into the Employee Elevator at Lakeview Hotel.\n\nbring your personal items into the Employee Elevator at Lakeview Hotel. Don't listen to Mary's entire sickbed speech in the long corridor near the very end of the game.\n\nOnce again, it's possible that the coin choice at the end of the Coin Cabinet puzzle in Wood Side Apartments doesn't affect the ending, but as you can pick from any of the three, it's best to pick a coin that might help you get the Maria ending, just in case.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nHow to get the Dog ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nYou need to play on New Game Plus to get the Dog ending in Silent Hill 2. If you are, then you need to get the Dog Key and use it on the Observation Room door in Lakeview Hotel to go and see Silent Hill's real mastermind. However, this time, the Dog Key is split into two Broken Key Parts in the remake, so you have to find and combine them first.\n\nBroken Key Part location 1\n\nThe first Broken Key Part that you need to get for the Dog ending is located inside the Pet Center store in East South Vale, which is found just left of the Big Jay's building, close to the Groovy Music store you need to visit to complete the Jukebox puzzle. The part is on top of a desk inside the small room at the back.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nBroken Key Part location 2\n\nThe second Broken Key Part that you need to get for the Dog ending is located inside a dog house in the garden of a house on the east side of Katz St. It's only accessible when you're exploring the West Side of South Vale after going through the gate at Jack's Inn with Maria.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nOnce you have both Broken Key Parts, combine them to make the Dog Key, then use the Dog Key to unlock the Observation Room on 3F of Lakeview Hotel, near room 312, to finally unlock the Dog ending. We recommend you save before unlocking the Observation Room door if you'd like to try and get another ending.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nHow to get the UFO ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nYou need to play on New Game Plus to get the UFO ending in Silent Hill 2. If you are, then you need to pick up the Blue Gem and use it at four unique locations to see the very unique alien-themed short film to unlock the UFO ending.\n\nBlue Gem location\n\nWhen playing on New Game Plus, the Blue Gem is located in the window of the Jewellers store in East South Vale, just north of the Big Jay's building, and Pet Center where you can find the first Broken Key Part.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nOnce you have the Blue Gem, 'Investigate' it from the main menu at these four locations to get the UFO ending:\n\nThe Rooftop of Saul Street Apartments in East South Vale, while standing beside the eye symbol printed on the vent. The western pier of Rosewood Park where you meet Maria, while standing beside the sign with the eye symbol printed behind it. Image credit: Eurogamer/Konami The docks of Lakeview Hotel while standing where you got off the boat after crossing Toluca Lake. In Room 312 of Lakeview Hotel, the same room where you watch the videotape.\n\nAs long as you investigated the Blue Gem at the previous three locations, you will automatically unlock the UFO ending when you investigate it in Room 312 at the end of Lakeview Hotel. So we recommend you make a save right beforehand if you'd like to get another ending after.\n\nHow to get Rebirth ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nYou need to play on New Game Plus to get the Rebirth ending in Silent Hill 2. If you are, then you need to pick up four new items and have them in your inventory at the end of the game to automatically unlock Rebirth. As long as you have these four items at the end, you will always unlock the Rebirth ending, no matter what choices you made before.\n\nThe four items you need to get the Rebirth ending are: Crimson Ceremony, White Chrism, Obsidian Goblet, and Lost Memories.\n\nCrimson Ceremony location\n\nCrimson Ceremony is located beside the grave near the water in the Graveyard, where you meet Angela for the first time right at the beginning of the game.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nWhite Chrism location\n\nWhite Chrism is located on the table outside of Baldwin Mansion in West Side South Vale, which you can access after going through the gate at Jack's Inn with Maria.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nObsidian Goblet location\n\nThe Obsidian Goblet is located inside a nook at the Historical Society in West Side South Vale, which you get access to after finding the Historical Society Key at Rosewood Park after completing the Brookhaven Hospital area.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nLost Memories location\n\nLost Memories is found on a shelf in the Lost and Found room in Lakeview Hotel on 1F. You can get into here by breaking the wall in Cafe Toluca.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nIf you've found all four of these items, you will get the Rebirth ending once you reach the end of the game, unless you trigger the Dog, UFO, Bliss, or Stillness endings beforehand.\n\nHow to get Bliss ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nBliss is one of the new endings in the Silent Hill 2 remake, but you can only get it if playing on New Game Plus. If you are, then you need to combine the new Rusted Key and Small Chest items to get the White Claudia, and then drink the White Claudia before watching the tape inside Room 312 of Lakeview Hotel to trigger the ending.\n\nSmall Chest location\n\nThe Small Chest is located inside the tiny enclosed seating area found in the northwestern side of the Garden in Brookhaven Hospital, which you get access to after finding the 1F Inner Ward Key on your way to solving the Hand puzzle. Crawl through a gap at the back to get into the small seating area.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nRusted Key location\n\nThe Rusted Key is located inside the safe at Pete's Bowl-O-Rama. The code is 1887, which you can find for yourself by picking up the Bloody Note by a body at the northwestern edge of town, near the Historical Society.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nHow to get Stillness ending in Silent Hill 2\n\nStillness is one of the new endings in Silent Hill 2 Remake, but you can only get it if playing on New Game Plus after getting the In Water ending. If you've done this, you need to find the Key of Sorrow to get the Toluca Postcard, which triggers the Stillness ending after you investigate the postcard from your inventory.\n\nKey of Sorrow location\n\nThe Key of Sorrow is located inside a green car on the northside of Wiltse Rd. near the beginning of the game, right after you leave the Ranch area. Use the Chainsaw you find near the Ranch in New Game Plus and break the car's windows to pick up the key.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nToluca Postcard location\n\nThe Toluca Postcard is inside the safe in the Manager's Office of the Otherworld Lakeview Hotel area. You need to use the Key of Sorrow and 314 code to open the safe and get the postcard.\n\nImage credit: Eurogamer/Konami\n\nOnce you have the Toluca Postcard, investigate it in your inventory to automatically get the Stillness ending.\n\nNow that you know how to get every ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake, it's time to go and get the only ending that makes sense. Say hello to the dog for me!"

Chief among them is Adobe, whose Terms of Service debacle in the summer led to a fierce backlash from creatives. But the brand's latest move might just help ingratiate the company with AI-sceptics.\n\nThe company has announced a new Content Authenticity Web App designed to \"champion creator protection and attribution\". An extension of the Content Authenticity Initiative we've already seen Adobe develop over the last couple of years, the new web app offers a free way for creators to apply content credentials to their work.\n\nAdobe\n\nAs well as adding credentials, the web app lets creators set AI training and usage preferences, essentially letting artists opt-out of being trained by models. Of course, this relies on other models recognising this, but Adobe is \"actively working to drive industry-wide adoption of this preference.\"\n\nA free, public beta of the Adobe Content Authenticity web app will be available in Q1 2025, and users can sign up for more information here. As well as the web app, there'll also be a handy Chrome extension for inspecting credentials.\n\nAdobe Content Credentials web app\n\n\"Adobe\u2019s new tool for signing artwork is a game-changer,\" gushes illustrator Pepita Sandwich via the Adobe website. \"It makes adding Content Credentials to digital pieces easy and professional. The interface is intuitive and ensures seamless integration, while the security features give me peace of mind. I also love that it offers the option to opt-out of AI training\u2014perfect for protecting my creative rights.\"\n\nIt's certainly a timely move for a company that has endured its fair share of criticism from artists this year, as well as facing the small matter of getting sued by the US government over its convoluted cancellation processes. But with the brand having previously committed to \"doing the right thing\" when it comes to AI, focussing its efforts on the Content Authenticity Initiative seems like a wise move."

        "article_content": "The ability to build your first Apple iOS app is now even easier, thanks to the power of artificial intelligence (AI). The process of creating a simple yet effective habit-tracking app using AI tools, specifically Cursor AI, requires no prior programming skills. As the AI-generated code and natural language processing, enables you to develop a fully functional app with ease, opening up a world of possibilities for aspiring app developers. In the video below Alex Finn takes you through the process step-by-step in just 7 minutes.\n\nGetting Started\n\nTo begin your app development journey, the first step is to download and install Xcode from the App Store. Xcode is Apple\u2019s official integrated development environment (IDE) and is essential for building iOS applications. Once you have successfully installed Xcode, create a new iOS project and give it a meaningful name, such as \u201cHabit Tracker.\u201d This initial setup forms the foundation of your app, allowing you to focus on designing an intuitive user interface and implementing key features rather than getting bogged down in complex coding tasks.\n\nSimplifying App Development with AI\n\nThe next step is to download and open Cursor AI, a powerful tool that simplifies the app creation process through AI-powered code generation. By opening your project folder in Cursor AI, you can start building your app without writing a single line of code.

Calendar View: Integrate a calendar view that displays habit completion over time, allowing users to track their progress and identify patterns.\n\nTesting and Iterating: Ensuring a Seamless User Experience\n\nTesting is a crucial step in the app development process, and Xcode provides a powerful tool called the iOS simulator to help you ensure your app\u2019s functionality. The simulator allows you to test your app on various virtual devices, simulating different screen sizes, resolutions, and hardware configurations. This enables you to identify and address any potential issues or bugs before releasing your app to the public.\n\nBased on the insights gained from testing, you can iterate on your app\u2019s features by adding new prompts in Cursor AI. This iterative approach ensures that your app meets user needs, functions smoothly, and provides an optimal user experience. By continuously refining and improving your app, you can create a polished and professional-grade application that stands out in the competitive iOS app market.\n\nExploring Potential and Future Steps\n\nThe ease and accessibility of app development using AI tools like Cursor AI highlight the immense potential for anyone, regardless of their technical background, to create powerful and engaging mobile applications. Once you have completed your habit-tracking app, consider taking the next step by uploading it to the App Store. This process involves following Apple\u2019s submission guidelines, ensuring your app meets their quality standards, and potentially monetizing your app through in-app purchases or advertisements.\n\nBy using the power of AI in app development, you can focus on creativity, innovation, and delivering a seamless user experience, making app development an achievable goal for beginners and experts alike. As you continue to explore the possibilities of AI-assisted app development, you may discover new opportunities to create more complex and feature-rich applications, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the world of mobile app development.\n\nApp Store Submission: Follow Apple\u2019s guidelines and submit your app to the App Store, making it available to a wide audience of iOS users.\n\nFollow Apple\u2019s guidelines and submit your app to the App Store, making it available to a wide audience of iOS users.

        "article_content": "The bomb that was \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\u201d loomed large over this past weekend, but further down the box office tally lies a success story: the limited-release documentary \u201cSam and Colby: The Legends of the Paranormal\u201d finished sixth despite playing to just 350 screens nationwide.\n\nThis feat is just the latest example of YouTubers finding mainstream traction through horror \u2014 a genre that has been one of the most eclectic and innovative corners of YouTube \u2014 though the platform has made it increasingly difficult for some of these creators to reach audiences.\n\nOriginally launching a general vlogging channel in 2014, Sam and Colby gained most of their 13 million subscribers after going all in on paranormal investigation videos. The pair\u2019s most popular videos are one-to-two-hour explorations of such iconic haunts as the Stanley Hotel (43 million views), the Queen Mary (22 million views) and the house that inspired \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d (39 million views).\n\nA staple of Sam and Colby\u2019s channel is Hell Week, an annual tradition where the pair release their biggest and scariest project of the year each October. Last year\u2019s limited 168-theater run with Cinemark for their \u201cConjuring\u201d house series sold out at every location, and so the duo upped the distribution to 350 screens for \u201cLegends.\u201d\n\nBox Office Mojo estimates \u201cLegends\u201d grossed around $1.76 million over the weekend, even with the movie playing to the fewest number of theaters in the top 10. The high fan turnout generated an average of nearly $6,000 per theater.\n\nSam and Colby\u2019s box office win speaks to the unassuming power of niche yet large online communities and the ability of online content to compete with mainstream entertainment \u2014 something on which Michael Bay is banking as he preps \u201cSkibidi Toilet\u201d for the big leagues.\n\nBut it\u2019s also just the latest instance of horror-focused creators jumping from YouTube to the mainstream. Last year saw the release of A24\u2019s \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d the acclaimed debut film written and directed by Danny and Michael Philippou, better known as RackaRacka to their 6.86 million YouTube subscribers.\n\nPremiering the week after \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d weekend, \u201dTalk to Me\u201d not only went on to earn over $92 million globally but it\u2019s A24\u2019s third-highest-grossing film behind Best Picture winner \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d and summer blockbuster \u201cCivil War.\u201d\n\nThe success of \u201cTalk to Me\u201d has seemingly opened the floodgates for scare-inclined creators to reach audiences beyond YouTube. A24 is looking to YouTube again for its next horror hit, this time striking a deal with 18-year-old Ken Parsons for a film based on his \u201climinal space\u201d-inspired \u201cBackrooms\u201d series.\n\nCurry Barker, who has made online waves with his award-winning short horror films (most recently the unsettling \u201cMilk & Serial,\u201d inspired by YouTube prank channels), is currently working on a full-length feature with \u201c47 Meters Down\u201d producer James Harris. In the meantime, YouTube film critic Chris Stuckmann\u2019s debut supernatural feature \u201cShelby Oaks,\u201d which raised over $1 million on Kickstarter, will be released by Neon next year.\n\nIt should be noted that this new era of online-bred scares hardly came out of nowhere. Horror is one of YouTube\u2019s most prolific genres, and its presence on the platform spans as far back as YouTube itself.\n\nAs a film genre, horror is often associated with low budgets, scrappy filmmaking and craftiness in the face of technical limitations \u2014 qualities that can also be applied to YouTubers, especially in the early \u201cBroadcast Yourself\u201d days. Some of the site\u2019s first viral scripted series, such as \u201cLonelygirl15\u201d and \"Marble Hornets,\u201d adapted \u201cfound footage\u201d-style horror for the vlogging era, sparking fierce online debates over whether these shows were real.\n\nDuring the 2010s, BuzzFeed\u2019s \u201cUnsolved\u201d series adapted the supernatural reality show format \u2014 a well-performing, if famously embellished, staple of cable \u2014 for online audiences, becoming one of the content studio\u2019s most beloved titles. The show\u2019s creator, Ryan Bergara, and co-host Shane Madej even leveraged the popularity of \u201cUnsolved\u201d to launch their own production company, Watcher Entertainment, alongside fellow BuzzFeed creator Steven Lim.\n\nToday, unscripted paranormal investigations are a fixture on YouTube. Offerings like Sam and Colby\u2019s or Watcher\u2019s \u201cGhost/Mystery Files,\u201d the spiritual successor to \u201cBuzzFeed Unsolved,\u201d regularly thrill millions with ghost hunts and paranormal encounters. Even non-horror YouTubers will occasionally embark on a ghost hunt for easy views.\n\nBut the biggest innovations for the horror genre are still coming from ambitious filmmakers including RackaRacka and Barker, despite YouTube\u2019s algorithm and monetization policy becoming more restrictive over the years. As part of its bid to keep advertisers happy and shed its amateurish reputation, YouTube is far from the wild West, anything-goes video platform that allowed creators to get gory in the 2000s and early 2010s.\n\nAs a result, creators of all genres are subject to the same monetization rules, which generally favor family-friendly content. The guys behind RackaRacka have even said they make little to no money on their videos \u2014 breakneck, bloody and stunt-fueled horror comedies \u2014 despite the millions of views on each.\n\nOn top of potentially being demonetized, more provocative creators also must contend with age-restriction warnings, which require users to sign into their YouTube account to confirm their age before watching the video. The issue is less about forcing users to sign in, and more that the ability for the video to be picked up by YouTube\u2019s algorithm and reach new audiences is drastically reduced. Creators can manually mark their videos as 18+, but that still impacts each one\u2019s standing in the algorithm and access to ad placement.\n\nYouTube\u2019s automation is also known to automatically age-restrict generally inoffensive videos \u2014 ones containing too many swear words, for instance \u2014 putting creators\u2019 livelihoods at risk. YouTube did loosen some of its monetization rules following creator backlash last year, but the constantly changing policies are still something creators need to tiptoe around.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, YouTube offers horror creators a platform to experiment, build a following and potentially break through. YouTube has also introduced additional income streams for creators outside of ads, including revenue from YouTube Premium and paid channel memberships in the vein of Patreon.\n\n\u201cWe welcome a variety of content and expression on YouTube, but not all videos are a fit for all advertisers, such as content that is age-restricted,\u201d said a spokesperson for the company. \u201cIn recent years, we have taken steps to increase transparency around our advertiser-friendly guidelines and have opened up new monetization opportunities, like channel memberships for creators whose content may not suit all advertisers. We\u2019ll continue to listen to the creator community about how we can support their success.\u201d\n\nAs YouTube takes on major streaming platforms, transforms its TV app into a full-on streaming platform and advocates for major awards recognition on behalf of its creators, it would be remiss to leave its horror-leaning creators out of the conversation.\n\nEven the most non-advertiser-friendly corners of the genre still generate passionate fandoms, and films like \u201cTalk to Me\u201d \u2014 and even \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s,\u201d the indie horror game turned major franchise thanks to a fervent YouTube fanbase \u2014 prove that wider audiences are interested.\n\nAnd when it comes to the content itself, the quality is there. Barker\u2019s short films wouldn\u2019t look out of place next to Netflix\u2019s horror offerings. All YouTube has to do now is give these creators greater license to scare the hell out of more people."

        "article_content": "A University of Texas at Dallas chemist and his colleagues have developed a new chemical reaction that will allow researchers to synthesize selectively the left-handed or right-handed versions of \"mirror molecules\" found in nature and assess them for potential use against cancer, infection, depression, inflammation and a host of other conditions.\n\nThe results are important because, while the left- and right-handed versions, or enantiomers, of chemical compounds have identical chemical properties, they differ in how they react in the human body. Developing cost-effective ways to synthesize only the version with a desired biological effect is critical to medicinal chemistry.\n\nIn a study published in the Oct. 11 issue of the journal Science, the researchers describe how their chemical synthesis method can quickly, efficiently and in a scalable manner produce a sample that is purely one enantiomer of a mirror-image pair of molecules, as opposed to a mixture of the two. The new method involves adding prenyl groups -; molecules made of five carbon atoms -; to enones by means of a newly developed catalyst in one step in the synthesis process.\n\nAdding a prenyl group is the way nature assembles these molecules, but it has been challenging for scientists to replicate this successfully.\" Dr. Filippo Romiti, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics at UT Dallas and corresponding author of the study\n\n\"Nature is the best synthetic chemist of all; she's way ahead of us. This research represents a paradigm shift in the way we can now synthesize large quantities of biologically active molecules and test them for therapeutic activity,\" said Romiti, who is also a Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT) Scholar.\n\nNaturally occurring compounds are a significant source of potential new medicines, but because they often occur only in minute quantities, scientists and pharmaceutical companies must develop methods to synthesize larger amounts to test in the lab or to manufacture into drugs.\n\nIn their study, the researchers demonstrated how incorporating their new chemical reaction resulted in a synthesis process that reached completion in about 15 minutes at room temperature, which is more energy-efficient than having to heat or cool substances significantly during a reaction.\n\nRomiti collaborated with researchers at Boston College, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Strasbourg in France to develop the new chemical reaction. Romiti's role involved creating the synthesis process.\n\nThe researchers developed their method as part of an effort to synthesize polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs), which are a class of more than 400 natural products with a broad spectrum of bioactivity, including combatting cancer, HIV, Alzheimer's disease, depression, epilepsy and obesity.\n\nRomiti and his colleagues demonstrated a proof of concept by synthesizing enantiomers of eight PPAPs, including nemorosonol, a chemical derived from a Brazilian tree that has been shown by other researchers to have antibiotic activity.\n\n\"For 20 years, we've known that nemorosonol is antimicrobial, but which enantiomer is responsible? Is it one or both?\" Romiti said. \"It could be that one version has this property, but the other does not.\"\n\nRomiti and his colleagues tested their nemorosonol enantiomer against lung and breast cancer cell lines provided by Dr. John Minna, director of the Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research at UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\n\"Our entantiomer of nemorosonol had pretty decent effects against cancer cell lines,\" Romiti said. \"This was very interesting and could only have been discovered if we had access to large quantities of a pure entantiomeric sample to test.\"\n\nRomiti said more research will be needed to confirm whether one nemorosonol enantiomer is specifically antimicrobial and the other anticancer.\n\nThe study results could impact drug discovery and translational medicine in several ways. In addition to informing scalable and more efficient drug-manufacturing processes, the findings will enable researchers to make more efficiently natural product analogs, which are optimized versions of the natural product that are more potent or selective in how they work in the body.\n\n\"We developed this process to be as pharma-friendly as possible,\" Romiti said. \"This is a new tool for chemists and biologists to study 400 new drug leads that we can make, plus their analogs, and test their biological activity. We now have access to potent natural products that we previously could not synthesize in the lab.\"\n\nRomiti said the next step will be to apply the new reaction to the synthesis of other classes of natural products, in addition to PPAPs. In August he received a five-year, $1.95 million Maximizing Investigators' Research Award for Early Stage Investigators from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to continue his work in this area.\n\nIn addition to CPRIT, the research was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation and from the NIH (2R35GM130395, 2R35GM128779) to co-corresponding authors and chemistry professors Dr. Peng Liu at the University of Pittsburgh and Dr. Amir Hoveyda at Boston College."

        "article_content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution continues to tout developing drugs faster and at lower cost, but are we there yet?\n\nOn October 2nd, the FDA cleared an investigational new drug (IND) application for a Phase I/II clinical trial of REC-1245, a new chemical entity for the treatment of biomarker-enriched solid tumors and lymphoma, developed by Recursion, the long-standing AI in drug discovery company founded in 2013.\n\nRecursion states that REC-1245 is the first program using the company\u2019s end-to-end AI platform, spanning discovery, biology, chemistry, and the clinic. According to Chris Gibson, CEO of Recursion, the potential therapeutic progressed from novel target biology to preclinical drug candidate in under 18 months, \u201cnearly twice the speed of the industry average.\u201d\n\nREC-1245 is a selective degrader of RBM39, a new target, identified by Recursion\u2019s AI-enabled Maps of Biology platform, with a similar biological function to the well-known but hard-to-drug target, CDK12. Preclinical data showed that RBM39 degradation induces splicing defects which downregulate DNA damage response (DDR) networks and cell cycle checkpoints, functional changes prevalent in cancer.\n\nMany investigational drugs designed to target CDK12 also inhibit the structurally similar CDK13, resulting in toxicity. In contrast, targeting RBM39 showed similar effects to the loss of CDK12 without affecting CDK13.\n\nIn an interview with GEN Edge, Simon Barnett, research director at Dimension, stated that drug discovery timeline compression can be a leading indicator of machine learning\u2019s (ML) capabilities. At the same time, proof points are just starting to come in, and \u201cit\u2019s still virtually impossible to say how ML-heavy discovery and development efforts are meaningfully warping phase transition likelihood.\u201d\n\nThat said, the industry will first hear about faster timelines before seeing drugs enter Phase II, Phase III, and achieve approval from these platforms.\n\n\u201cIn biotech, time is money, so it means something,\u201d said Barnett. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be one-off examples until we can corral many examples. We\u2019ll then have some real firepower behind these statements of what data-driven methods can do in life sciences.\u201d\n\nREC-1245 joins the Salt Lake City-based company\u2019s existing clinical pipeline, whose therapeutic areas span from precision oncology to rare disease. The Phase I/II clinical trial for REC-1245 is expected to initiate in Q4 2024. Recursion estimates that the initially addressable population for this potential therapeutic will be over 100,000 patients in the United States and EU5.\n\n\u201cRBM39 degraders may offer a promising therapeutic approach for patients with solid tumors, particularly those with limited treatment options,\u201d said Najat Khan, PhD, chief R&D officer and chief commercial officer at Recursion. \u201cThis mechanism provides new opportunities for targeting tumors, which are often resistant to conventional treatments.\u201d\n\nPrior to joining Recursion in April, Khan played an integral role in building leading therapeutic pipelines as chief data science officer and global head of strategy and portfolio organization R&D at Johnson & Johnson. GEN Edge caught up with Khan to reflect on REC-1245\u2019s IND approval, the evolution of Recursion\u2019s AI-based drug discovery platform, and what\u2019s next for the field.\n\nInterconnectedness like a highway\n\nWhile traditional drug discovery builds upon the literature of established targets, Recursion was founded on the mission to discover novel therapeutics by looking at the entirety of biological systems.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s critical to understand is not just whether one gene is driving a disease, but all the interconnectedness like a highway. There\u2019s beauty in understanding how perturbing one thing impacts the rest of the system,\u201d said Khan.\n\nAt the core of Recursion\u2019s technology is the Recursion Operating System (OS), a platform powered by the company\u2019s large proprietary phenomic datasets, spanning\n\ntranscriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and more. The platform leverages Maps of Biology, which create millions of biological relationships by perturbing human cell lines to instill a disease state and testing compounds to reverse the cells to healthy function. Machine learning algorithms then evaluate gene-gene and gene-compound associations of interest to identify novel drug targets, such as RBM39.\n\nKhan emphasized that starting with human cell lines in phenomics \u201cmakes a massive difference that doesn\u2019t get talked about enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cTranslation gap is one of the biggest issues we have in the industry because we don\u2019t have good models to predict human response,\u201d Khan told GEN Edge. \u201cHow can we start with human-centric models that are cost-effective and standardized? That\u2019s what phenomics allows us to do so that we\u2019re able to anticipate and optimize before we go into the clinic.\u201d\n\nEnd-to-end platform\n\nOver the past 18 months, Recursion has made strides in growing its end-to-end AI drug discovery platform.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that to truly bring value in many cases to the industry, you can\u2019t just optimize one of the hundred steps to discovering and developing a medicine. You have to optimize entire pathways of discovery and development,\u201d said Gibson in an interview with GEN Edge.\n\nIn 2023, Recursion acquired Cyclica and Valence, whose technologies enhanced proteome-wide prediction of small molecule-target interactions and low-data learning in drug design respectively.\n\nIn one of the largest M&A events in the AI drug discovery field in August, Recursion entered a definitive agreement to combine with U.K.-based Exscientia. According to Recursion, the agreement combined Recursion\u2019s scaled biology exploration for target identification with Exscientia\u2019s precision chemistry for lead optimization for a complementary pipeline. The company expects approximately 10 clinical readouts over the next 18 months and is leveraging four large partnerships with Roche-Genetech, Bayer, Sanofi, and Merck KGaA. These growing industrialized workflows also promote speed in automation, thereby contributing to lower costs.\n\nWhile these end-to-end platforms continue to build, the probability of success through the clinic in the drug discovery industry remains at approximately 10%. According to Gibson, the reason for this low statistic is \u201cnot because people aren\u2019t good at science but because biology is really, really, really complex.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole reason why we founded Recursion: To leverage sophisticated computational tools to disentangle these thousands of parameters of biology that no human can hold in their head,\u201d Gibson told GEN Edge. \u201cOur belief is that this approach is sound and that it will just take us time to be able to kind of get the flywheel moving and really start to show people.\u201d\n\nKhan concurs and highlights that \u201cquality is more important than quantity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have done enough in science and development to know not everything works, but we\u2019re going to focus on showing pivotal examples where we can make molecules, get them to the clinic, and benefit patients differently than anybody else can,\u201d said Khan.\n\nSo are we there yet? We\u2019re mapping out a fast-track road. While one-off drug candidates are not overturning the industry, they\u2019re one step forward toward a new drug discovery paradigm.\n\n*Najat Khan, PhD, will be the opening keynote speaker at GEN\u2019s inaugural virtual event, The State of AI in Drug Discovery, streaming on October 30th."

This blend allows startups to explore various niches and collaborate across industries.\n\nFor instance, companies like CrowdSource focus on AI and data analytics, while startups like Sana Health are redefining healthcare solutions. This diversity leads to a dynamic environment where entrepreneurs can leverage cross-industry insights to drive innovation.\n\nMoreover, the presence of established tech giants, such as Dell and IBM, contributes to a rich ecosystem. These companies often collaborate with startups, providing them with mentorship and access to resources, which further enhances the startup landscape.\n\nThe Role of Government and Policy Support\n\nGovernment support plays a significant role in fostering Austin\u2019s startup culture. Local policies often favor entrepreneurship, with initiatives designed to reduce regulatory burdens and encourage innovation. Programs aimed at supporting small businesses create a conducive environment for startups to flourish.\n\nFurthermore, the Texas state government has taken steps to promote economic growth. With no personal income tax, Texas attracts entrepreneurs looking to maximize their profits. This favorable tax environment has contributed to the migration of businesses from high-tax states to Texas, including Austin.\n\nNetworking Events: Building Connections\n\nAustin\u2019s calendar is filled with networking events that cater to entrepreneurs. Meetups, pitch nights, and hackathons offer opportunities for startups to showcase their ideas and connect with potential investors.\n\nEvents like Austin Startup Week and Startup Grind bring together founders, investors, and industry experts. These gatherings foster collaboration, allowing entrepreneurs to gain insights and forge relationships that can lead to future partnerships.\n\nChallenges in the Startup Terrain\n\nWhile Austin boasts a thriving startup culture, it is not without its challenges. The rapid growth of the tech scene has led to increased competition for talent and funding. Startups must continuously innovate to stay ahead in this dynamic environment.\n\nMoreover, the cost of living in Austin has risen, making it challenging for some startups to attract talent without offering competitive salaries. As a result, companies must find creative ways to foster a positive work culture and retain their employees.\n\nFuture Prospects: Sustainability and Growth\n\nLooking ahead, Austin\u2019s startup culture is poised for continued growth. As more entrepreneurs flock to the city, the ecosystem will become increasingly diverse and innovative.\n\nHowever, sustainability will be a critical focus. As the city grows, maintaining the collaborative spirit and sense of community that define Austin\u2019s startup culture will be essential. Initiatives aimed at preserving affordable housing and supporting local businesses will play a crucial role in shaping the future of Austin\u2019s startup landscape.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe unique startup culture in Austin is a product of its creative vibe, supportive community, access to funding, diverse talent pool, and commitment to inclusion. As the city continues to change, its startup ecosystem will remain a vibrant force in the national and global tech terrain. With its blend of innovation, collaboration, and diversity, Austin stands out as a prime destination for entrepreneurs seeking to launch their startups. As more visionaries settle in this thriving city, the future of Austin\u2019s startup culture looks promising, ensuring that it remains a key player in the ever-evolving tech terrain."

        "article_content": "The 10th anniversary cohort for the 43North startup accelerator and incubator is set.\n\nThe five winners of a $1 million investment from the 43North finals competition are FoodNerd, one of the competition\u2019s three semifinalists from Buffalo; HeronAI of Cambridge, Mass.; CoverRight of Brooklyn; Rarebird of San Francisco; and Spiky.ai of Brookline, Mass.\n\nAdditionally, Food Nerd earned the $25,000 People\u2019s Choice Award, sponsored by Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, during Thursday night\u2019s competition at Shea\u2019s Buffalo.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul was in attendance to help announce the winners.\n\n\"What we are creating tonight is the next generation of entrepreneurs who are going to make us proud,\" she said.\n\nThe prize winners are required to base their operations in Buffalo for at least one year, and 43North receives a 5% equity stake in their businesses. 43North hopes to persuade the startups to remain in Buffalo beyond the one-year minimum, creating jobs and making investments in the region.\n\n\u201cWe want to be a longtime successful partner in this ecosystem,\u201d said Spiky.ai founder Burak Aksar, who\u2019s already working with a past 43North finalist, Guidesly, to assist its sales and support teams.\n\nSpiky.ai\u2019s employees have worked mostly remotely since the startup was founded in 2020 \u2013 a year dominated by the Covid-19 pandemic, but Aksar believes this is the right time to create a headquarters in Buffalo, which would include hiring teams to work in artificial intelligence and sales.\n\n\u201cWe want to build our AI hub in Buffalo,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ecosystem is already strong here; let\u2019s make it even better.\u201d\n\nThe finalists included companies across a range of other industries, showcasing innovation in artificial intelligence, ed tech, fintech, food tech and health tech.\n\nThese companies emerged from nearly 1,000 applications coming from businesses worldwide.\n\n43North celebrated its 10th anniversary with video montages of its decade-long impact on Buffalo and the local startup ecosystem as an introduction to and during the show and by naming a leader for the 43North Foundation\u2019s new Venture Studio, which will invest even further into startups in the region. That\u2019s ACV co-founder Dan Magnuszewski.\n\nLeaders of the startup ecosystem and 43North startup founders from prior years joined Colleen Heidinger, executive director of 43North, on the stage before the pitches.\n\n\"For 10 years, we have made dreams come true on this stage,\" Heidinger said. \"We have helped shift this city into one of possibility and promise.\"\n\nHere's a look at the five winners:\n\nFoodNerd\n\nBuffalo health food maker FoodNerd is a food technology platform redefining the way shelf-stable foods are processed with patent-pending technology that creates nutraceutical-grade food.\n\nIt is working with three partnerships in the supplement, pet and adult spaces, but the products are chiefly made at this point for children from eight months to 3 years old, selling mostly direct to consumer. It also has a state government contract.\n\nThe company is planning a move in the next few months from an 8,000-square-foot manufacturing facility to one that is 30,000 square feet. There, it expects to nearly double its production and phase into more retail.\n\nFoodNerd is also closing a $4 million funding round, said founder Sharon Cryanr, a native of Buffalo and attorney by trade.\n\nCoverRight\n\nCoverRight is a guide for older adults through health, finance and lifestyle options, operating at the intersection of digital health and finance.\n\nAbout 11,000 Americans are retiring every day and they have less retirement funds to live on and rising health care costs to contend with, said founder Kevin Chan.\n\nThe startup\u2019s platform provides education and saves clients hours of confusion and research, guiding them through key decisions using a digital platform.\n\nCoverRight\u2019s revenue comes from commissions from Medicare plans, and it works with over 20 health insurers. It has partnered with service providers like credit unions, pharmacies and grocers. Chan said, once in Buffalo he is looking to connect with Highmark, Independent Health and M&T Bank.\n\nHeronAI\n\nHeronAI uses AI to help midsized accounting firms through an automated platform that aims to save them about seven hours per account per week.\n\nThat time can now be used to spend with current clients in different ways and acquire new ones, said founder Daphne Pariser. The AI the startup integrated into its systems even answers questions in 56 languages.\n\nThe startup founded last year has grown significantly over the past six months \u2013 and by 540% since its launch \u2013 and now has a waitlist of around 1,600 potential clients looking to use the tool, which allows accounting firms to streamline month-end advisory reporting, leading to the reduction in reporting time.\n\nIts goal is to help firms deal with the expectation that approximately 75% of accountants in the field will retire over the next decade and there likely will not be enough people to replace them and the work they perform.\n\nRareBird\n\nRareBird is a coffee maker using paraxanthine to make the world\u2019s first patented coffee with a caffeine replacement.\n\nFounder Jeffrey Dietrich says that according to studies 75% of Americans drink coffee on a weekly basis but 50% of them do not like how coffee makes them feel \u2013 jittery and restless.\n\nMost of the subscription-based company\u2019s sales are direct to consumer but it would like to be in retail shops, like Tim Hortons, Dietrich said. It is planning to lease space at the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and run a roastery in Buffalo by next year, aided by a $1.7 million National Science Foundation grant.\n\nRarebird, which has raised $7 million to this point, would like to hire about a half dozen people in Buffalo, including a head roaster, Dietrich said.\n\nSpiky.ai\n\nSpiky.ai provides real-time, AI-driven customer insights and tips for revenue teams to help enhance their selling effectiveness.\n\nThe company learns from customer data, closes the feedback loop, generates follow-ups and ultimately, saves time. It is already working with go-to-market entities like Google and Sales Force helping to build its platform.\n\nSpiky.ai is analyzing 6,000 meetings every week, working with 1,400 companies and there are 3,000 additional companies in the pipeline, according to Aksar, a native of Turkey. The company has seen 15% month-over-month growth.\n\n\u201cEven the best revenue teams struggle with this problem,\u201d Aksar said. \u201cThis is not a sales or marketing problem anymore; it is an engineering problem, and it requires real engineers to solve it.\u201d\n\nBuffalo companies fall short\n\nThe two additional companies from Buffalo that competed in the semifinals \u2013 but didn't make it to the finals on Thursday \u2013 were BosonQ Psi and Offerwell. A total of 70 tech startups applied for this year's 43North competition.\n\nBosonQ Psi, a Buffalo transplant company originally from India, works with aerospace, design defense partners and heavy-industry manufacturers to provide a faster and more accurate simulation platform powered by quantum algorithms.\n\nOfferwell works exclusively with real estate agents to make transactions easier through an AI-driven platform that streamlines offer management and showings and provides real-time data and analytics."

        "article_content": "HP is in the process of redoing its product lines, with the OmniBook lineup taking over all of its consumer machines including budget, midrange, premium, and gaming laptops. The EliteBook remains as its business laptop line, and the new EliteBook X G1a is the latest machine that leverages AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI series of chipsets in the \u201cNext Gen AI PC\u201d initiative.\n\nThe EliteBook X G1a introduces several new features aimed at those tasks that businesspeople want the most, and I received a preproduction unit to take a look at. I can\u2019t provide benchmarks or test some of the more advanced features that aren\u2019t available yet. But the EliteBook X G1a is a tantalizing vision.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDesign\n\nHP makes some good-looking and high-quality laptops. The EliteBook X G1a is a prime example. It\u2019s solid as a rock all around, with no bending, flexing, or twisting in the lid, keyboard deck, or chassis. And it all seems crafted from chunks of aluminum in a way that\u2019s reminiscent of of Apple\u2019s MacBooks. The silver color scheme is elegant and refined, with a chrome HP logo that stands out without being mere bling.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nThe hinge is smooth when opening the lid with one hand, and it stays firmly in place. It might be a pre-production unit, but it doesn\u2019t need much adjusting. I like the look and feel quite a bit, and I\u2019m sure HP\u2019s business market will agree.\n\nI don\u2019t have full specs for the laptop. But, it\u2019s not the thinnest or lightest 14-inch laptop. In fact, it\u2019s a little chunky compared to something like the incredibly thin MacBook Air M3 that\u2019s closer to a 14-inch than a 13-inch laptop. I don\u2019t mind it, but it\u2019s not going to lead its class. The display bezels are small enough to keep its width and depth in check, but the Dell XPS 14 remains the best in that department.\n\nI also liked the slightly rounded edges on the palm rest. That made it comfortable for longer typing sessions, like writing up this first look. Overall, I found the same kind of fastidious design that I\u2019ve always perceived in Apple products.\n\nKeyboard and touchpad\n\nHP also makes good keyboards. Its Spectre keyboards have always been among my favorites on Windows laptops, coming very close to my overall favorite, Apple\u2019s Magic Keyboard. And they put a great keyboard in the EliteBook X G1a.\n\nFirst, the keycap size and key spacing is perfect, and HP put high-contrast lettering that stands out against the dark gray keys. That makes the lettering easier to see even without the backlighting turned on, and it\u2019s an accessibility feature for those with poor vision. Then, the switches are deep enough at 1.5mm, and they\u2019re precise and snappy. They\u2019re also consistent across the entire keyboard, including the space bar that can be too loose on some keyboards.\n\nThe touchpad is mechanical, which is a bit of a disappointment. Haptic touchpads are becoming more common on premium laptops, and HP has a great one on the Spectre x360 14. I wish it were available here. The touchpad is plenty large and its buttons have quiet, confident clicks. So it\u2019s a good mechanical touchpad.\n\nThe display is touch-enabled, which I like. Overall, input options are excellent even if I wish the touchpad were a haptic version.\n\nConnectivity and webcam\n\nThe EliteBook X G1a has plenty of connectivity, with a couple of Thunderbolt 4 ports, USB-C and USB-A, and an HDMI port. Again, I don\u2019t know all the specs, including wireless connectivity, but I have no doubt it\u2019s up-to-date and that cellular connectivity will be an option. Note that the inclusion of Thunderbolt 4 is a little surprising given the AMD chipset. That\u2019s usually not a thing.\n\nThe webcam is a 5MP version, but it\u2019s not just a high-res webcam. It includes on-chip AI processing that enables enhanced user presence detection that, for example, blurs the screen automatically when two people are in view. There\u2019s also the usual AI-enhanced functionality we expect with Microsoft\u2019s various Copilot+ features, and Poly Camera Pro that further enhances video quality and performance using the neural processing unit (NPU).\n\nPerformance\n\nHP uses a custom version of AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 9, specifically the R9-12c PRO that\u2019s based on the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 PRO. It enables the kind of security and manageability that enterprises demand, along with the sheer power of the Ryzen AI 9 chipset. I don\u2019t have details on the chipset and I can\u2019t publish any benchmarks.\n\nThe custom aspect is that the HP-specific chipset has faster on-device AI thanks to an NPU that runs at up to 55 tera operations per second (TOPS). That\u2019s faster than any other chipset available today, and that means faster AI processing with the efficiency of the NPU compared to using the GPU.\n\nThere\u2019s also custom RAM that runs at up to 8,000 MT/s, faster than you\u2019ll see from other AMD chipsets. That, too, helps speed up AI processing. And HP will be introducing its AI Companion software that will enable a variety of AI features above and beyond what Copilot+ provides. AI Companion includes Analyze that lets you dig into files, along with other features that have yet to be fully explained. All of the features will run on-device, though, keeping things theoretically safer and more private and using the NPU to maintain efficiency.\n\nHP also updated its SmartSense feature to use AI to better manage performance and fan speed. Now, there are just two options available \u2014 SmartSense and Best Performance \u2014 meaning that users won\u2019t need to spend as much time managing the EliteBook X G1a\u2019s performance, heat, and noise. We\u2019ll have to wait until we can run benchmarks to determine how effective the new software is in managing things.\n\nFinally, as a member of HP\u2019s business lineup, the EliteBook X G1a has Wolf Security for enhanced security and privacy.\n\nBattery life\n\nThe battery here is reasonably hefty at 74.5 watt-hours. That should be plenty to power the laptop for a reasonably long time regardless of the display choice. But, once again, it\u2019s not something I can test and report on.\n\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 9 chipset hasn\u2019t been as efficient as some others, though, such as Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake that we saw in the Asus Zenbook S 14.\n\nDisplay and audio\n\nThere will be two display options with the EliteBook X G1a. There\u2019s a 14.0-inch WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS panel and a 2.8K (2880 x 1800) OLED touch display. The latter runs at up to 120Hz, and it\u2019s the one on my pre-production unit.\n\nI can\u2019t test the display, but it seems to offer the same bright, dynamic colors and inky blacks that I expect out of a typical OLED display. The IPS panel will offer better battery life but much worse image quality.\n\nAudio is provided by a four-speaker setup \u2014 two downward-firing and two upward-firing. Dual microphones use AI Noise Reduction to improve quality.\n\nAn intriguing laptop for business users\n\nAt this point, the most I can say about the EliteBook X G1a is that it\u2019s an incredibly intriguing laptop with a host of features and functionality that could make for an elite (no pun intended) laptop for business users. It\u2019s drop-dead gorgeous and solidly built, even for a pre-production machine. And it promises great performance and AI integration.\n\nOf course, the devil will be in the details, including pricing, and those will have to wait until it\u2019s formally introduced. In the meantime, businesses should be looking into the EliteBook X G1a for its 2025 procurements."
