            "article_content": "The internet has been left divided over an 'egg-shaped craft' recorded during a UAP retrieval operation after the video was aired on TV for the first time.\n\nNewsNation aired the footage that 'clearly showed' the object dangling in a sling from a helicopter on Saturday night.\n\nThe alleged craft was about 20ft long and resembled the UAP encountered by the Navy off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects, NewsNation reported.\n\nIt was pointed out in the video that the object had no markings, being 'perfectly smooth', and no 'visible' means of propulsion or way to look inside.\n\nAfter the segment aired, Redditors had mixed opinions on the footage's veracity, although many were impressed by what they saw.\n\n'This is pretty cool. I don\u2019t know what you guys were expecting of a nighttime retrieval. This is actually more clear than I thought it would be. It helps to lower expectations,' one wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'I had a feeling that the video would be somewhat ambiguous. I'm not sure this is gonna move the needle without more substantiating evidence. I think it's great, personally, but this isn't gonna convince Joe Taxpayer.'\n\n'Probably is real. But you aren\u2019t going to convince people with this. To claim this is any different from any other sketchy video already seen (outside the gimbal & go fast) is a stretch & hardly going to make anybody new sit up & take notice. Too bad,' another wrote.\n\nNewsNation aired the footage which 'clearly showed' the object dangling in a sling from a helicopter\n\nThe outlet was told the craft was about 20ft long. It's said to resemble the UAP encountered by the Navy off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects\n\nHowever, other users were much less convinced.\n\n'Well, the video quality is better than I expected, I'll give them that. The object itself? With no frame of reference to judge size, it could be an actual chicken egg as far as I can tell,' one Redditor wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'This video could not have been cheap to make with the cost of eggs these days!'\n\n'No reference to size, this could literally be a chicken egg on a string, with helicopter noises edited in,' a third added.\n\n'This shows nothing. This is not earth shattering, redefining man kind evidence they were promising,' another wrote.\n\nA fifth commented: 'I knew the footage was not going to be good. But what exactly am I looking at here? An egg on the end of a fishing rod?'\n\nOther users pointed out some potential issues with the credibility of the footage.\n\n'What kind of terrain is this supposed to be on? Something about the scaling and shadow feels off,' one questioned.\n\n'Well, the video quality is better than I expected, I'll give them that. The object itself? With no frame of reference to judge size, it could be an actual chicken egg as far as I can tell,' one user wrote\n\nAnother eagle-eyed user said: 'If this was in the desert how is the helicopter not blowing up dust and sand like crazy.'\n\n'So, like, wouldn't they drop off the egg thing on a truck or something or a base? Why are they dropping it off on the ground of what appears an empty desert field?' another wrote.\n\n'No prop wash? I could fake this in my house right now in an hour,' a Redditor added.\n\nAnother user replied by pointing out the lack of sway in the rope.\n\n'So, they retrieved and filmed just an egg-shaped thing. It wasn't flying, it wasn't doing anything. What a load of utter nonsense this is,' one user said.\n\nThe video, which was kept in the dark until its bombshell release, is the latest video footage that has made the rounds online in recent weeks seemingly depicting a UFO.\n\nWidespread interest and coverage of the subject surged after drones were seen flying across New Jersey last month.\n\nOffering a solution to the mystery, Tucker Carlson made a shocking claim that the mysterious drones were controlled by a Chinese mothership satellite.\n\nTucker Carlson discussed the mysterious drones on his show this week, saying he was told the objects were controlled by China\n\nThe White House repeatedly stated that the drone sightings are not a foreign adversary, pose no threat and are not part of a US military operation\n\nThe first sightings appeared over the Picatinny Arsenal in Rockaway and President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster in November, followed by thousands more in the skies.\n\nWhile the US government was quick to dismiss claims they were foreign adversaries, Carlson claimed he was told otherwise.\n\nHe said, 'an intel person' told him that the drones 'were in fact Chinese,' explaining the US government took down a Chinese satellite 'that was a command and control satellite for these drones.'\n\nCarlson appeared to be hinting at a Beijing-operated satellite known as GaoJing 1-02 which fell from space on December 21.\n\nAstronomers tracking such devices confirmed the Chinese satellite re-entered Earth's atmosphere above New Orleans and headed north towards Mississippi, Arkansas and Missouri before burning up in the atmosphere.\n\nBut Carlson claimed it was 'taken down by the US government.'\n\nHe made the claims while speaking with independent journalist Michael Shellenberger, who heard a similar explanation for the drones.\n\n'Somebody told me that that the military got one of the orbs, opened it up and it was Chinese,' Shellenberger said.\n\nThe White House repeatedly stated that the drone sightings - which coincidentally began on November 18 - are not a foreign adversary, pose no threat and are not part of a US military operation.\n\nBut Carlson said his inside source told him that 'the belief was the Chinese government was sending the following message, 'We're moving on Taiwan.''"

According to a new report with NewsNation, U.S. Air Force veteran and whistleblower Jake Barber claims he was contracted as a helicopter pilot to retrieve downed craft.\n\nIn the report, he\u2019s sharing a video and claiming that he has retrieved nonhuman vehicles that seem to go against all physics. That or it\u2019s Mork from Mork and Mindy in his giant egg rolling on the ground under a tarp. You be the judge.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\n\u201cI saw an egg, a white egg,\u201d Barber said to the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s inconsistent with anything I\u2019d ever seen before. I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.\n\nPlay video\n\n\u201cOver the last couple years, it\u2019s been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP task force that what we were working with that night was, in fact, NHI (nonhuman intelligence) and it was not a unique experience,\u201d they added.\n\nThe report was touted by musician, filmmaker and all-around talented guy Flying Lotus on Twitter. Setting the tone for how people might be absorbing these new revelations.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s the big day huh? Lets see,\u201d he wrote alongside an alien and UFO emoji. \u201cI hear we will see \u2018paradigm shifting\u2019 evidence of a UFO crash retrieval today for the first time from a first hand witness.\u201d\n\nThis is only the latest revelation out of the disclosure we\u2019ve seen in recent years. The end of 2024 into the new year saw plenty of questions about drones across multiple areas on the East Coast. We\u2019ve also heard about the \u201cnonhuman\u201d intelligence during the Congressional testimony from the likes of Lue Elizondo and David Grusch.\n\nIf this turns out to be a Robin Williams clone gone awry, I might just have to hang it up. Life will have officially drifted into being a Family Guy gag."

            "article_content": "Ready to have a close encounter of the Steven Spielberg kind?\n\nThe acclaimed director is filming his upcoming UFO movie in New Jersey.\n\nThe film, starring Oscar nominee Emily Blunt (\u201dOppenheimer\u201d), is in need of Jersey people for background actors.\n\nNew York\u2019s Grant Wilfley Casting tells NJ Advance Media that the production is holding an open casting call for Cape May locals to play train passengers and car drivers (see more below).\n\nThe filming will take place in March \u2014 not long off from Jersey\u2019s brush with drone and/or plane-related, supposedly \u201cunidentified\u201d flying objects at the end of 2024.\n\nThe movie, which is as yet untitled \u2014 but reportedly (tentatively) titled \u201cThe Dish\u201d \u2014 also stars Emmy winner Josh O\u2019Connor (\u201dThe Crown,\u201d \u201cChallengers,\u201d \u201cLa Chimera\u201d), Oscar nominee Colman Domingo (\u201dRustin,\u201d \u201cSing Sing\u201d), Oscar winner Colin Firth (\u201dThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d \u201cBridget Jones\u2019s Diary\u201d) and Eve Hewson (\u201dBad Sisters\u201d).\n\nUniversal Pictures and Spielberg\u2019s Amblin are producing the film, penned by \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d and \u201cIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\u201d screenwriter David Koepp.\n\nThe movie has been pegged to a May 15, 2026 release date.\n\nJosh O'Connor, Colman Domingo, Eve Hewson and Colin Firth will also star in the upcoming Spielberg movie, due out May 2026.Theo Wargo | Getty Images; Gilbert Flores | GG2025 | Penske Media via Getty Images; Stefanie Keenan | WireImage; Michael Tran | AFP via Getty Images\n\nOf course, aliens and UFOs are some of Spielberg\u2019s most prominent material. The Oscar-winning director famously helmed \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d (1977), \u201cE.T.\u201d (1982) and \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d (2005), which also filmed in New Jersey.\n\nSpielberg, 78, spent some of his youngest years as a child living in New Jersey with his family, as depicted in his film \u201cThe Fabelmans\u201d (2022). He most recently filmed in Jersey, largely in Paterson, for his take on \u201cWest Side Story\u201d (2021) starring Clifton\u2019s Rachel Zegler.\n\nThe Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet-Bob Dylan movie \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d directed by James Mangold, also filmed in Cape May this past spring.\n\nHere are the details for the casting call:\n\nThe Spielberg production, code name \u201cNon-View,\u201d needs extras to play car drivers and train station passengers. Applicants must be at least 18, no previous acting experience necessary.\n\nFilming will tentatively take place Monday, March 10 through Friday, March 14 in Cape May. The base pay rate is $216 per day (eight hours) and the car allowance is $37.50.\n\nTo be considered for the film, send Grant Wilfley Casting an email \u2014 address nj@gwcnyc.com. Use the subject line \u201cNon-View Cape May Locals\u201d and include this information:\n\nYour name, pronouns, phone number, whether or not you are a SAG-AFTRA member, what dates you are available during the filming window, whether or not you have visible tattoos and whether or not you are local to Cape May. Include current non-professional photos of yourself, both close-up and full-body. If you own a car that you can use in the film, also send the color, year, make and model and a photo of the car."

So yeah, it is a bit odd. We're hearing opera.\"\n\nHe added: \"So yeah, I just don't know, I really don't.\n\n\"I mean I'm a bit sceptical about the whole thing, the different types of experts, but it does creep me out though, because I think I've creeped myself out.\n\n\"I don't know how much of my creepiness now is self-induced or whether it is actually Agnes.\n\n\"She doesn't strike me as, I can't believe I'm even talking about her like she exists, but she doesn't strike me as an evil presence.\"\n\n6 The prankster had a ghost of a famous opera singer named Agnes residing in his basement Credit: Getty\n\n6 Paul Chuckle is amongst the stars to feature on a previous edition Credit: Discovery+"

            "article_content": "Sam Altman Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nOpenAI, as you likely know, is one of tech\u2019s biggest unicorns.\n\nA group of entrepreneurs and researchers, including Elon Musk and the company\u2019s current CEO Sam Altman, founded the artificial intelligence company in 2015. Today, OpenAI is valued at a whopping $157 billion \u2014 putting it on par with the market capitalizations of public companies like AT&T, Goldman Sachs and Uber, per The Wall Street Journal. Its flagship offering, ChatGPT, launched in 2022, and today reportedly has 250 million weekly users and 11 million paid subscribers.\n\nAmong OpenAI\u2019s investors are Microsoft, which invested $13 billion in the company, Nvidia, which invested $100 million and SoftBank, to the tune of $1.5 billion. In October, OpenAI received a $4 billion credit line \u2014 with the option to extend it another $2 billion \u2014 from JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, UBS and other institutional investors.\n\nBut OpenAI hasn\u2019t turned a profit. The company projected $5 billion in losses on $3.7 billion in revenue for 2024. It announced at the end of the year it would change its corporate structure, essentially going from a nonprofit to a company with investors and the potential for stock shares. \"We once again need to raise more capital than we\u2019d imagined,\" OpenAI\u2019s board wrote in a statement.\n\nAltman has since said the company is losing money on its $200-per-month Pro subscriptions, which offer limitless access to its most recent model, OpenAI o1, and to its video generator, Sora AI. \"People use it much more than we expected,\" he wrote in a post on X. The company\u2019s biggest cost, according to The New York Times, is powering the supercomputers that run its AI.\n\nIn a 6,000-word Q&A with Altman, Bloomberg inquired how the company prices \"technology that\u2019s never existed before.\" \"Is it market research?\" the publication asked. \"A finger in the wind?\"\n\n\"We launched ChatGPT for free, and then people started using it a lot, and we had to have some way to pay for it,\" Altman said. He said the company tested two prices for its most popular product, ChatGPT Plus: $20 and $42. Users didn\u2019t like the $42 price point, Altman said, so the company picked $20.\n\n\"It was not a rigorous \u2018hire someone and do a pricing study\u2019 thing,\" Altman said.\n\nIf history tells us much, the vast dollars-and-cents discrepancy between what investors think OpenAI is worth and the company\u2019s profits, or lack thereof, doesn\u2019t spell doom. OpenAI is far from the first tech brand to score a sky-high valuation from financial institutions despite not generating any financial returns. In 2017, roughly 76% of the companies that went public were unprofitable the year before, CNBC reported.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "By Chloe Mari A. Hufana, Reporter\n\nA STRICTER monitoring and enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with labor standards is needed amid a \u201cdim\u201d employment outlook, particularly in the country\u2019s service and agriculture sectors, a labor leader said.\n\nA recent International Labour Organization (ILO) report on insufficient global employment growth mirrors the situation in the Philippines, where persistent decent work deficits in the service and agriculture sectors are attributed by the Federation of Free Workers (FFW) to rampant contractualization, low wages, and unsafe working conditions.\n\n\u201cThe outlook remains dim, particularly when considered alongside the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) recent report. It estimates that 14% of the workforce \u2014 around 5 million Filipino workers \u2014 are at risk of displacement this year due to artificial intelligence (AI) and climate change,\u201d FFW President Jose Sonny G. Matula told BusinessWorld in a Viber message over the weekend.\n\nThe ILO\u2019s World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2025, released last week, found employment growth globally remained \u201ctoo weak\u201d to significantly impact lingering decent work deficits.\n\nWhile employment growth remains steady, various factors are testing the resilience of labor markets worldwide, it added.\n\n\u201cThe lack of faster global productivity growth is partly linked to the failure of structural change to move people out of agriculture into manufacturing and services,\u201d it noted.\n\n\u201cGiven the poor working conditions in much of farming outside advanced economies, this also means that working poverty and informality have not benefited from people moving out of agriculture to better-paying jobs in industry and services,\u201d it added.\n\nIndividuals in informal employment, particularly in agriculture and other sectors like wholesale and retail trade, often face irregular income and lack access to social protection, it added.\n\n\u201cIn this context, the vigorous exercise of the Department of Labor and Employment\u2019s (DoLE) inspection and visitorial powers under the Labor Code is essential,\u201d Mr. Matula said.\n\n\u201cStrengthened monitoring and enforcement mechanisms will ensure that employers comply with labor standards, while the Employment Plan should adapt to rapidly changing labor market dynamics, including those influenced by technology and climate change,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 2024, global employment grew alongside the expanding labor force, maintaining the global unemployment rate at a steady 5%, consistent with the level recorded in 2023, the ILO noted.\n\nHowever, this growth remains insufficient to address persistent decent work deficits as young workers continue to face high unemployment rates, around 12.6%, with little sign of improvement, it added.\n\nLabor Secretary Bienvenido E. Laguesma said the department conducted \u201cextensive national consultations,\u201d culminating in the upcoming 10-year Trabaho Para sa Bayan (TPB) Plan to address weak job growth.\n\n\u201cThrough these initiatives, we have identified several key areas of intervention that align with the goals of the TPB Plan and aim to address the challenges of regional employment disparities, particularly in rural areas,\u201d he told BusinessWorld in a Viber message over the weekend.\n\n\u201cAgriculture remains a cornerstone of rural employment, and we are committed to transforming this sector to boost productivity and job creation,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted the Labor department aims to introduce technology-enabled farming practices, climate-resilient methods and value-added processes into agribusiness through the Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives will not only create more jobs but also enhance the sustainability and profitability of rural livelihoods,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Agency\u2019s (PSA) November 2024 Labor Force Survey, the agriculture sector experienced the highest year on year job loss, with 1.99 Filipinos leaving the sector.\n\nThe agency attributed the loss to typhoons.\n\nRURAL WORKFORCE\n\nAccording to Mr. Laguesma, DoLE is empowering local government units (LGUs) to spearhead rural development by supporting them with investment strategies, microfinance for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and infrastructure projects under the Build Better More program.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives will ensure that rural areas become hubs for inclusive economic activity,\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition, DoLE is collaborating with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and local institutions, prioritizing tailored skills training.\n\nPrograms will focus on green skills development, digital upskilling and vocational training to prepare rural workers for opportunities in sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, and renewable energy, he noted.\n\n\u201cOur Public Employment Service Offices (PESOs) are key to facilitating job placement and matching in rural areas,\u201d he added, noting that digitalization and enhancing labor market intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe aim to make employment services more accessible and effective, enabling rural job seekers to connect with opportunities tailored to their skills and aspirations,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe labor chief also added the department is committed to fostering sustainable job opportunities in agriculture, eco-tourism and clean energy. These green initiatives will ensure long-term job creation while protecting environmental resources.\n\nSocial safety nets for rural workers are critical, he noted, adding the ILO has been helping DoLE in achieving these initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe will broaden coverage of social protection programs to include informal workers, addressing vulnerabilities and providing stability during economic transitions,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBy prioritizing rural job creation and addressing regional disparities, we aim to build a resilient and equitable labor market where every Filipino has access to quality employment.\u201d"

The incident, which involved an upgraded Starship carrying a test payload, prompted airlines to reroute flights over the Gulf of Mexico as debris scattered, marking a setback for Elon Musk's rocket program. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, in coordination with Turks and Caicos officials, is investigating the fallout, though no injuries have been reported.\n\nIn Belgium, scientist Clement Martin is collaborating with federal police to create a groundbreaking scent mimicking the smell of dried bones, helping sniffer dogs locate long-missing remains. This innovation follows Martin's earlier work isolating the scent of decomposing flesh, now essential in training cadaver dogs across Belgium.\n\nMeanwhile, archaeological explorations in Pompeii have uncovered an opulent private bath complex, providing insights into the affluent lifestyle of the Romans before the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The newly unearthed site features hot, warm, and cold baths that could accommodate up to 30 guests, adorned with Greek mythological themes, showcasing the luxury of that era.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "Seven-year-old electric vehicle startup Canoo has filed for bankruptcy and will \u201ccease operations immediately.\u201d The company is liquidating its assets in a Chapter 7 proceeding in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court.\n\nThe company said in a press release published late Friday that it was \u201cin discussions with foreign sources of capital\u201d that proved unsuccessful, and also singled out an inability to secure funding from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Loan Program Office, which has been on a lending spree in the waning days of the Biden administration.\n\nCanoo said in its bankruptcy filing (and the filings for its subsidiaries) that it owes money to hundreds of creditors, and that it has more than $164 million in total liabilities. It claimed around $126 million in assets.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing comes just a few weeks after Canoo furloughed the remainder of its workers and idled its factory in Oklahoma. The company struggled throughout 2024 to get more than a few of its electric vans into the hands of prospective customers, and suffered numerous executive departures. It had just $700,000 in the bank in mid-November.\n\nCanoo is the latest EV startup to go bankrupt after merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) as a shortcut to going public. Electric Last Mile Solutions was the first in June 2022. But since then, Fisker, Lordstown Motors, Proterra, Lion Electric, and Arrival all filed for different levels of bankruptcy protection in their various home countries. (Canoo bought Arrival\u2019s assets out of insolvency in 2024, though it\u2019s unclear if it ever put any of it to use.)\n\nCanoo announced plans to merge with SPAC Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. in August 2020, and went public that following December, raising around $600 million. In the years since it went public, the company made a small number of its bubbly electric vans and handed them over to partners \u2014 some paying \u2014 willing to trial the vehicles. The United States Postal Service, Department of Defense, and NASA all have or had Canoo vehicles.\n\nAt one point, the company even courted Walmart, which agreed to purchase as many as 10,000 EVs from Canoo in 2022. But the deal was essentially non-binding and bore little risk for the retail giant.\n\nCanoo was founded in late 2017 by a splinter group of executives that were fed up with the drama surrounding the other EV startup where they worked at the time, Faraday Future. Originally called Evelozcity, those executives developed a modular electric vehicle platform that could power cabins in multiple shapes and sizes, and utilized advanced technology like a steer-by-wire system.\n\nThe ideas inside Canoo were attractive enough that the startup at one point was in talks with Apple, which was interested in a potential investment or even acquisition as a way to boost the tech giant\u2019s own secretive electric car project. Former CTO and at one point CEO of Canoo, Ulrich Kranz, went on to help run Apple\u2019s car project before it was disbanded in 2024.\n\nBut Canoo underwent numerous pivots after it went public and gained a new chairman and CEO in Tony Aquila, who had invested in the company prior to the merger.\n\nA serial entrepreneur, Aquila immediately refocused Canoo away from selling to consumers and prioritized commercial fleets. On his watch, Canoo repeatedly changed plans on whether it would build its own electric vehicles or outsource the work. At one point Canoo, announced it was moving its headquarters to Bentonville, Arkansas \u2014 the home of Walmart \u2014 but then never really followed through. Instead, the company spent years trying to stand up multiple manufacturing facilities in Oklahoma.\n\nAquila\u2019s own financial firm appeared to benefit from his post atop the company. In 2023, Canoo spent double its meager revenue to Aquila\u2019s firm to pay for the use of its corporate jet. Canoo also rented office space from Aquila\u2019s firm, according to regulatory filings.\n\nIt was also Aquila\u2019s firm that kept Canoo alive in recent months. The firm loaned Canoo a few million dollars to keep the lights on dating back to October. Those loans were secured by a \u201cfirst priority lien and security interest\u201d on the equipment located at the Canoo\u2019s Oklahoma City facility.\n\nSigns of a bankruptcy were bubbling up all week. Reddit users noticed that the company\u2019s billboard outside its office in Justin, Texas had been taken down. Multiple employees who were on furlough told TechCrunch that they received official termination notices. Some people who had placed $100 deposits when the company was still planning on selling to regular customers had started to get refunds.\n\nThis story has been updated with new information about Canoo\u2019s total creditors, assets, and liabilities."

Originally hailing from Jharkhand, Mr Jha left a stable banking career in Singapore to pursue his passion for deep space and communications technology by launching his own company.\n\nA native of Jamshedpur, India, Mr Jha pursued electrical and electronic engineering at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore on scholarship after completing high school. He began his career in high-frequency trading at the Royal Bank of Canada in 2011, where he encountered a significant challenge.\n\n\"It was in banking that I finally realised why the internet sucked,\" Jha told CNBC Make It.\n\nMr Jha explained that companies providing internet connectivity primarily target regions with high returns on investment, prioritizing tier-one cities while neglecting or offering limited access to less developed or remote villages.\n\nIt was also around this time that he realized the banking sector wasn't the right fit for him.\n\n\"I was lucky, because it was the hand-picked team in the entire company, and some of the best people I've ever worked with in my life - very impressive people - but ... there were many times that I felt like a cog in the whole organisation,\" Mr Jha told CNBC Make It. \"You have one life, and [I'd] rather work on things where [I'm] sitting at the edge of the unknown.\"\n\nIn 2015, Mr Jha left his job, spent a year travelling, and then founded Transcelestial. The startup aims to improve internet accessibility by creating a laser-based network that connects cell towers, street-level poles, and other infrastructure, offering a fiber-like communication system.\n\nTranscelestial's ambitions extend beyond Earth as well. The company plans to build a \"constellation of small satellites in low Earth orbit,\" enabling its laser network to not only span cities but also connect continents on a global scale, according to a company statement."

Moscow called the attack retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory, which in recent weeks appear to have intensified.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said that four ballistic missiles and 39 attack drones had been launched in the assault and that two of the ballistic missiles had been shot down in the Kyiv region. Although the city comes under drone attack almost nightly, ballistic missile launches targeting the capital are less frequent.\n\nThe pre-dawn attack ruptured a water main near the city center, sending water cascading through the streets around the battered facade of the Lukianivska subway station. Nearby, smoke was rising from a charred van with at least two burned bodies inside."

            "article_content": "A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip came into effect on Sunday, following a delay of nearly three hours. The truce halts a devastating 15-month-long conflict that has caused widespread destruction and loss of life. After months of intricate and tense negotiations, the agreement aims to provide a reprieve from the violence that has gripped the region, while addressing the political and humanitarian crises exacerbated by the ongoing war.\n\nDespite the delayed start, residents and medical workers in Gaza reported no new fighting or military strikes after about 30 minutes before the ceasefire was implemented. However, Israeli airstrikes and artillery attacks killed 13 Palestinians in Gaza between 06:30 GMT, when the ceasefire was originally set to begin, and 09:15 GMT, when it was finally enacted, according to Palestinian medics.\n\n#WATCH | Delhi | Reuven Azar, Israeli Ambassador to India, says, \"The ceasefire Israel signed off to is the first phase of a gradual deal which has the potential of bringing back our hostages and also making sure Hamas won't be ever able to massacre Israelis like it did on\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fBZwWi7jNP \u2014 ANI (@ANI) January 19, 2025\n\nReasons for the Delay\n\nIsrael\u2019s military blamed Hamas for the delay, citing the Palestinian militant group\u2019s failure to provide a list of hostages to be released as part of the agreement. Hamas attributed the delay to \u201ctechnical\u201d reasons, though it did not elaborate further. A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated that the delay was due to mediators requesting 48 hours of \u201ccalm\u201d before the ceasefire, but Israeli strikes had made it difficult to send the list of names.\n\nAlso Read Israeli PM Netanyahu delays Gaza ceasefire until Hamas releases hostage list\n\nTwo hours after the deadline, Hamas announced that it had sent the names of the hostages to be released, with Israeli officials confirming the receipt. The three hostages named for release on Sunday were Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher, and Emily Damari, although Israel did not immediately confirm their identities.\n\nDetails of the Ceasefire Agreement\n\nThe ceasefire deal follows months of on-again, off-again negotiations, involving mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and the United States. The deal, which is seen as a potential step toward ending the Gaza war, is structured in three stages. The first stage will last six weeks and will involve the release of 33 of the remaining 98 hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe first hostages to be released will include women, children, and the elderly, and they are expected to be transferred through the Red Cross. In return for each of the hostages released, Israel will free 30 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas will coordinate with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to determine the meeting points inside Gaza for the handover.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement, though a step forward, does not yet guarantee a full resolution to the conflict. The ongoing war, which erupted after Hamas launched attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, has claimed thousands of lives, with nearly 47,000 Palestinians killed in the conflict. The war has also exacerbated tensions throughout the Middle East, drawing in Iranian-backed militant groups and causing diplomatic isolation for Israel.\n\n(With Reuters Inputs)"

            "article_content": "What silently pulls the levers and gives liquidity to markets? Automation and complex algorithms trade securities at a blistering speed, shaping financial exchanges \u2013 and investors can use this algorithmic trading to their advantage.\n\nHere, Telegraph Money explains what algorithmic trading is and how it works in live markets.\n\nSimply, algorithmic trading is the use of computer functions to automatically make trades in financial markets.\n\nThe algorithms are pre-programmed to execute buy and sell orders based on certain variables, or a set of variables, taking place without human intervention.\n\nIn forex markets, roughly 90pc of trades are done using algorithms. In equities, roughly 60-75pc of trades in American, European and Asian capital markets are done through pre-programmed functions.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAn individual or, as is predominantly the case, an institutional investor will use automated algorithmic strategies to execute trades.\n\nInstitutional investors dominate the space through sheer position size, placing large trades to reduce transaction costs.\n\nGiven that size, one large trade from a hedge fund or investment bank has the ability to disrupt the market. Algorithmic trading can break up that trade into smaller increments to be deployed at coordinated times.\n\nFor instance, an order of 1 million shares would send a strong signal to the market, whereas an algorithm trading instruction of 1,000 shares every 15 seconds is more palatable and, in some cases, less noticeable.\n\nInitially, algorithmic trading can appear daunting. Indeed historically, trading platforms required a knowledge of coding to build the algorithms.\n\nNow, platforms cater for those with minimal coding experience and a degree in computer programming isn\u2019t necessary.\n\nTo use it, the first step is to gain an understanding of common algorithmic strategies, such as trend-following, mean reversion, high-frequency trading and arbitrage (more on these later).\n\nThen develop a strategy based on data and knowledge of the market. Consider: how will the algorithm react to certain trading signals? What has to happen for it to place orders according to those signals?\n\nBacktesting the algorithm \u2013 that is testing it using historical data \u2013 may not be necessary for a pre-existing algorithm. That said, thorough testing of how the algorithm works and its suitability for live markets is key.\n\nLike all trading strategies, implementing good risk management, like stop-losses, position sizing and diversification, is essential."

(Photo Credits: Israel Antiquitis Authority/Atiqot)\n\nA religious shrine, believed to have been sealed by the ancestors of Jesus and preserved for nearly 3,000 years, has been uncovered in Jerusalem, according to a report by the New York Post. The shrine, carved into the rock near Temple Mount, features eight rooms including an altar, a sacred standing stone and presses for making olive oil and wine.\n\nExperts believe the destruction of this shrine could be linked to the biblical figure Hezekiah, an ancestor of Jesus. Though excavations began in 2010, the northern part of the site was first discovered in 1909 by British explorer Montague Parker.\n\nrelated stories\n\nEli Shukron, the excavation director at the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), published findings in the IAA\u2019s scientific journal Atiqot. Shukron explained that the shrine dates back to Hezekiah\u2019s reign when other ritual sites existed outside the main temple during the First Temple period.\n\n\u201cThe structure ceased to function during the 8th century BC, possibly as part of King Hezekiah\u2019s religious reform,\" Shukron told the outlet.\n\nAccording to the Bible, Hezekiah\u2019s reforms aimed to centralise worship at the temple in Jerusalem and abolish scattered ritual sites across the kingdom. Both Hezekiah and his successor, Josiah, are mentioned as paternal grandfathers of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew.\n\nHezekiah\u2019s actions are described as a campaign to destroy pagan worship locations including sacred stones. The standing stone at this site survived Hezekiah\u2019s abolition.\n\nShukron referred to the discovery as \u201cthe most dramatic and important find in the excavation.\"\n\n\u201cIt is what makes this place a cultic site. When we uncovered it, we found it standing in its place, with stones around it. The standing stone was covered with earth; it was preserved \u2013 no one destroyed it,\" Shukron said.\n\n\u201cWhen we found it, it was exactly as it was here 2,800 years ago,\" he added.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nThe excavation team also discovered the remnants of an altar, identifiable by a drainage channel that still runs from one of its corners. In another area of the site, obscure v-shaped carvings were found on the floor. These carvings are thought to have supported a ritual tripod.\n\nDuring the excavation, archaeologists uncovered several 8th-century BC artefacts hidden behind a stone wall in a cave. These items included cooking vessels, jars marked with ancient Hebrew inscriptions, and items used for daily life such as loom weights and grinding stones. They also found scarabs and seals with decorative designs.\n\nLocation : Delhi, India\n\nFirst Published: January 19, 2025, 15:00 IST"

            "article_content": "Recent UFO Cloud Sightings Over the UK: A Growing Phenomenon\n\nIn recent years, the United Kingdom has become a hotspot for unusual atmospheric phenomena, including sightings of UFO clouds. While UFO sightings themselves are not new, there has been a notable increase in reports of strange cloud formations that appear to be connected to UFO activity. These incidents have fuelled speculation that the skies above the UK might be hiding more than just ordinary weather patterns. From rural areas in Scotland to urban centres in England, observers have documented several UFO-related cloud events, prompting fresh debates about the connection between these clouds and extraterrestrial craft.\n\nWhen people think of UFOs, they often envision saucer-shaped craft zooming through the sky, or strange lights darting across the night. However, there is another intriguing phenomenon that has become linked with UFO sightings\u2014UFO clouds. These mysterious cloud formations, which often appear anomalous or out of place, have sparked numerous theories and debates over the years. Are these clouds simply rare meteorological events, or could they be related to extraterrestrial activity? In this article, we explore the fascinating world of UFO clouds, the possible causes behind them, and how they tie into UFO lore.\n\nWhat Are UFO Clouds?\n\nThe term \"UFO cloud\" refers to a type of cloud formation that appears unusual or particularly striking in appearance, often leading observers to associate them with unidentified flying objects or extraterrestrial phenomena. These clouds are typically characterised by their strange shape, colour, or movement, and they often appear in areas where UFO sightings have been reported. While some of these clouds are nothing more than unusual atmospheric phenomena, others appear to defy typical meteorological explanations, sparking theories of alien involvement.\n\nOne of the most common characteristics of UFO clouds is their circular or disc-like shape. They often appear as smooth, flat clouds with defined edges, resembling the classic depictions of UFOs in popular culture. These formations can be strikingly similar to the saucer-shaped objects that UFO enthusiasts believe extraterrestrials use for travel. As a result, many UFO sightings involve reports of a UFO cloud in the vicinity, further fueling speculation about their connection.\n\nThe 2021 \"Saucer Cloud\" Incident Over London\n\nOne of the most widely reported UFO cloud sightings in recent UK history occurred in London in 2021. Witnesses described seeing a disc-shaped cloud hovering over the skyline, with its smooth, circular edges resembling the classic depiction of a UFO. The cloud was observed in broad daylight, and although it did not move in a manner that suggested it was a flying object, the perfectly symmetrical shape led many onlookers to wonder if it was an optical illusion caused by a UFO. Eyewitnesses also noted that the cloud appeared to glow faintly in the light, further enhancing its surreal and otherworldly presence.\n\nSeveral UFO researchers quickly jumped on the case, suggesting that the cloud could be linked to some form of atmospheric disturbance created by a UFO. Meteorologists, however, suggested that the cloud could have been a rare lenticular cloud, which can form in circular shapes under specific atmospheric conditions, especially near mountain ranges or strong wind currents. Still, the resemblance to the saucer-shaped craft often seen in UFO sightings was too uncanny to ignore, and the event gained significant attention on social media.\n\nUFO Cloud Sightings in Scotland\u2019s Highlands\n\nIn Scotland, particularly in the remote Highlands, there have been increasing reports of mysterious cloud formations that coincide with UFO sightings. In 2020, a group of hikers in the Cairngorms National Park described seeing unusual cloud structures in the sky, which they believed were connected to a UFO. The clouds were described as massive, elongated formations that appeared to \"move\" in strange patterns, with some observers even reporting that the clouds seemed to change shape rapidly, as if they were being manipulated by a force beyond the natural elements.\n\nSome locals in rural parts of Scotland have long been proponents of the idea that the area\u2019s isolation and its connection to ancient folklore might attract UFOs or otherworldly visitors. These recent cloud sightings, coupled with ongoing UFO reports, have only strengthened these theories. The belief that UFOs use the clouds as a form of camouflage or as a by-product of their energy emissions has found fertile ground in these remote communities.\n\nStrange Clouds Over Manchester\n\nIn late 2022, Manchester, a bustling urban centre in the north of England, became the site of another mysterious cloud sighting. Several witnesses reported seeing a dark, swirling cloud that appeared to hover for an unusually long period above the city. The cloud was said to take on an amorphous, disc-like form before dissipating into the sky without any clear explanation.\n\nWhat made this sighting particularly intriguing was the concurrent UFO sighting reported by a resident just hours before. According to the witness, they saw a series of bright lights darting across the sky, followed by the sudden appearance of the swirling cloud. Some speculated that the cloud might have been a side effect of the UFO\u2019s propulsion system, or that the lights and cloud were linked in some way. A few local news outlets picked up the story, with experts offering both mundane meteorological explanations and more speculative theories involving extraterrestrial phenomena.\n\nThe Connection Between UFOs and Clouds in the UK\n\nThe recent spate of UFO cloud sightings over the UK has led some to wonder whether there is a pattern connecting these unusual formations to extraterrestrial activity. The country has seen a notable uptick in UFO reports over the past decade, with several credible witnesses\u2014ranging from military personnel to ordinary citizens\u2014describing sightings of strange lights or unidentified craft in the sky.\n\nSome UFO enthusiasts and researchers argue that the unusual clouds could be camouflage for UFOs, a way for extraterrestrial craft to hide their presence in plain sight. According to this theory, UFOs might create or manipulate cloud formations in such a way as to remain undetected by conventional observation, blending in with the natural weather patterns.\n\nOthers speculate that these clouds may be linked to atmospheric anomalies created by UFO propulsion systems. Some UFOs, especially those described as \"saucer-shaped\", are often associated with electromagnetic or plasma-based propulsion methods. According to proponents of this theory, the interaction between the craft\u2019s energy field and the surrounding atmosphere could lead to the formation of oddly shaped clouds, which could be mistaken for a natural weather phenomenon.\n\nAdditionally, it's possible that the rise in sightings of UFO clouds is simply a result of heightened public awareness and media coverage of UFO phenomena. As UFOs and related sightings become a more widely discussed topic\u2014thanks in part to government disclosures and the release of previously classified reports\u2014more people may be looking at the sky with a more discerning eye, noticing unusual cloud formations that they might have otherwise overlooked.\n\nScientific and Meteorological Explanations\n\nOf course, there are scientific explanations for most of these strange cloud sightings. As mentioned earlier, lenticular clouds and roll clouds are two of the most commonly misidentified formations. Both types of clouds have a characteristic shape that can resemble UFOs or discs, particularly when seen from certain angles or under specific lighting conditions.\n\nMeteorologists also point out that some weather systems\u2014such as cold fronts or warm air surges\u2014can produce clouds that appear to behave in unusual ways, such as hanging low in the sky or shifting shape rapidly. Such phenomena could be responsible for some of the recent reports in the UK, especially those involving swirling, elongated clouds.\n\nTypes of UFO Clouds\n\nThough no official meteorological classification exists for UFO clouds, several specific types of cloud formations have become associated with UFO phenomena. These clouds share certain characteristics, which make them seem out of place or highly unusual. Here are some of the most common types:\n\n1. Lenticular Clouds\n\nLenticular clouds are large, lens-shaped clouds that often form over mountains or other elevated terrain. These clouds are typically stationary and can take on a disc-like appearance, which has led many to speculate that they are associated with UFOs. Lenticular clouds are formed when air flows over a mountain range, creating a standing wave of air. As the air moves upward and cools, it condenses into a cloud, and its shape can appear very similar to a saucer or disc.\n\nLenticular clouds are commonly mistaken for UFOs because of their smooth, distinct shape, and they often appear to hover in the sky. While these clouds are completely natural and can be explained by atmospheric science, their resemblance to UFOs has contributed to numerous sightings and theories about extraterrestrial activity.\n\n2. Roll Clouds\n\nA roll cloud is a type of low, horizontal cloud that can appear to \"roll\" across the sky, giving it a cylindrical appearance. These clouds are usually associated with storm fronts and can stretch for hundreds of miles. Although roll clouds are a well-known meteorological phenomenon, their long, uniform shape and movement can create an eerie or otherworldly effect. In some cases, roll clouds have been reported in conjunction with UFO sightings, and their unusual, rolling motion has led to speculation that they may be linked to alien technology or atmospheric anomalies caused by UFOs.\n\n3. Mammatus Clouds\n\nMammatus clouds are puffy, balloon-like formations that typically appear beneath the base of a thunderstorm cloud. They often create a striking and somewhat ominous visual effect, with their bulbous, sagging appearance giving them a surreal, otherworldly quality. While mammatus clouds are associated with intense thunderstorms, their strange shape and eerie nature have caused some to connect them with UFOs or extraterrestrial activity. The clouds' unusual appearance, particularly when seen in isolation or during an otherwise calm period, can evoke images of hovering ships or alien craft, leading to UFO-related speculation.\n\n4. Noctilucent Clouds\n\nNoctilucent clouds are high-altitude clouds that are most visible during the summer months, especially at latitudes between 50 and 70 degrees north and south. These clouds form in the mesosphere, far higher than typical clouds, and they glow with an eerie, blue or silver light after sunset. While the phenomenon can be explained by the reflection of sunlight on ice crystals in the clouds, the unusual, glowing nature of noctilucent clouds has led to various UFO-related theories. Their ethereal glow and unusual location in the atmosphere have given rise to questions about whether they might be linked to extraterrestrial activity or even serve as a cover for UFOs.\n\nUFO Clouds and the UFO Phenomenon\n\nThe connection between UFO clouds and UFO sightings is a subject of intense fascination for both UFO enthusiasts and meteorologists. Some individuals claim that certain UFO clouds are associated with UFO activity, suggesting that the clouds might be a type of camouflage or atmospheric distortion created by alien spacecraft. Others believe that UFOs themselves may be responsible for the formation of these clouds, either as a result of the energy they emit or the atmospheric disturbances they cause.\n\nOne of the most notable cases linking UFOs to clouds occurred in 1957, when several people reported seeing a UFO hovering above a strange cloud formation over the Pacific Northwest in the United States. The object was described as disc-shaped, and the cloud that formed underneath it appeared to be perfectly round, prompting some to believe that the cloud was the result of the UFO\u2019s activity. Since then, similar reports of UFO sightings coinciding with unusual cloud formations have been documented, further cementing the idea that there may be a connection.\n\nScientific Explanations vs. Extraterrestrial Theories\n\nWhile UFO clouds are often seen as evidence of alien involvement in atmospheric phenomena, there are more grounded scientific explanations for these unusual cloud formations. Meteorologists argue that many of the clouds associated with UFO sightings are simply natural occurrences. Lenticular clouds, roll clouds, and mammatus clouds are all well-documented and have clear meteorological explanations that do not require the involvement of extraterrestrial beings.\n\nHowever, the mystique of UFOs and the possibility of alien life continues to captivate the human imagination. For many, the idea that UFOs might be responsible for certain cloud formations provides a compelling narrative that fits within the broader framework of UFO lore. The persistent sightings of these clouds, combined with the belief in extraterrestrial visitation, means that UFO clouds will likely continue to fuel theories and debates for years to come.\n\nConclusion: A Continued Mystery\n\nThe recent sightings of UFO clouds in the UK serve to deepen the mystery surrounding both unidentified flying objects and the enigmatic nature of cloud formations. While scientific explanations are readily available, the persistent association of these unusual clouds with UFO sightings continues to fuel the debate about extraterrestrial involvement.\n\nAs UFO sightings remain a popular subject of fascination for many, it seems likely that these strange, disc-shaped clouds and anomalous weather phenomena will continue to spark curiosity. Whether they are merely natural atmospheric events or signs of something more profound remains a question that has yet to be definitively answered. For now, the skies above the UK\u2014and the mysterious clouds within them\u2014remain a captivating enigma."

            "article_content": "Chief Adviser's Press Secretary Shafiqul Alam on Saturday, January 18, said ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina must be returned to the country through legal process and brought her to justice.\n\n\"The way Sheikh Hasina brought back her father's murderers, we will bring back the murderers of the movement and try them in court,\" he said.\n\nShafiqul made the remarks while speaking as the main discussant at a seminar titled 'July Revolution Aspirations and the Media' in Kushtia.\n\nThe Islamic University, IU, authorities and the Islamic University Journalists Association, IUJA, jointly organised the seminar at Bir Shrestha Hamidur Rahman Auditorium on the campus in the district.\n\nAlam said the interim government is working on state reforms to build Bangladesh as per the aspirations of the July Revolution and implementing the aspirations of the people.\n\nHe also said half of the IU students are female ones, which is a very good image.\n\n\"I saw in the documentary that girls were leading the July movement. This university played an important role in the movement,\" the press secretary said.\n\nNoting that this image should be conveyed to the world as the future of the students is related to the image, he said, \"We have to work to preserve the history of the movement of this university.\"\n\nHe said the names of the halls that still remain in the name of the dictator need to be changed to the martyrs' names.\n\nThe press secretary said the aspirations of people are being fulfilled through reform commissions to build a new Bangladesh.\n\nThe reports of commissions are the outcomes of the July Uprising, he said, urging all students to read these reports and join debate on those on the campus.\n\nChaired by Chairman of IU Communication and Multimedia Journalism Department Professor Dr Rashiduzzaman, the seminar was addressed, among others, by IU Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Nakib Muhammad Nasrullah, Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Yeaqub Ali, treasurer Professor Dr Jahangir Alam and treasurer of Jashore University of Science and Technology Professor Dr Hossain Al Mamun.\n\nSM Rashidul Islam, special correspondent of Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS), also spoke at the seminar as a discussant.\n\nSource: BSS"
