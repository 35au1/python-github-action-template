Here's how experts say you can and should, report UFO or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) in Canada.\n\nTransport Canada collects aviation occurrence information and enters it into the Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Reporting System, known as CADORS.\n\nIn CADORS reports, Transport Canada said the term \u201cUFO\u201d can include sightings of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs or drones), balloons, meteors, weather phenomena and birds.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\u201cIt should not be interpreted to mean something of extraterrestrial origin. The information in CADORS should be treated as preliminary, unsubstantiated and subject to change,\u201d said Flavio Nienow, Transport Canada spokesperson, in a statement.\n\nTransport Canada said they don't have any additional information to provide beyond what can be found in CADORS.\n\nHow does Transport Canada followup on reports?\n\nWhen reports like these are generated, Nienow explained the next steps depend on the type of the incident reported.\n\n\u201cFurther follow up may be undertaken by various organizations including Transport Canada, Nav Canada, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada and the North American Aerospace Defense Command,\u201d he said. \u201cTransport Canada will use every tool at its disposal in an attempt to find an aircraft found to be operating in an unsafe and unlawful manner.\u201d\n\nNienow said anyone who witnesses unsafe aviation activity should contact Transport Canada or local law enforcement. Witnesses are encouraged to record and provide as much information as possible to help Transport Canada review incidents more effectively. For example, send clear photos or videos, record the date, time and any other identifying marks.\n\nOther aviation incidents may be reported at Incident reporting: Report an aviation incident. Drone-related incidents can also be reported.\n\nHow else can you report?\n\nThe U.S.-based National UFO Reporting Center collects all sorts of reports \u2014 including UFO and UAP reports from Canada, the U.S., and around the world. They encourage people to use their website to report occurrences.\n\nThroughout its history, the organization has processed more than 180,000 reports.\n\n\u201cWe look at every single report. We make an assessment,\u201d said Christian Stepien, the organization's chief technology officer, and follow up on reports that require a more in-depth look.\n\nReports are placed in the organization's databank, where you can review past reports categorized by date and location.\n\nThis publication reached out to the Ontario Provincial Police about UFO or UAP reports and asked how they advise citizens both generally and specifically to report them. We have not yet received a response."

Perhaps that\u2019s a cheap shot at the Garden State on my part: A YouGov poll this year found that some 18 percent of Americans nationwide report having seen a U.F.O.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. issued a joint statement last week assuring the public that they \u201ctake seriously the threat that can be posed by unmanned aircraft systems.\u201d And this week the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned drones from flying over nearly two dozen communities in the state.\n\nIn some cases, people in New Jersey have been sending their own commercially available drones aloft to investigate reports of \u2026 all the flying drones.

            "article_content": "Surprising reason why 'aliens are more likely to be seen at Christmas'\n\nFor some, Christmas isn't just about festive cheer; it's also prime time for spotting extraterrestrial visitors, reports suggest. December has become notorious for an increase in reported UFO sightings, and experts believe there's a valid explanation.\n\nChristian Stepien, technical director at the UFO Reporting Centre, notes that fireworks and light shows are often mistaken for otherworldly phenomena. The centre typically observes a \"slight uptick\" in such reports twice annually, with the holiday season being a peak time for these supposed cosmic encounters.\n\nRon James from the Mutual UFO Network told The Daily Beast: \"We do have a slight uptick twice a year in the summer and around the holidays. There are a few reasons why people might be paying more attention: they might be off work, they're doing family activities and things they don't normally do, so there are more possibilities for people to encounter things. Then, of course, there's always Santa Claus and the reindeer.\"\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\n\"If there is an uptick, I can understand that because there's a lot of people out during Christmas time shopping and doing things. They might be looking up in the air so I can understand it if there is.\"\n\nUfology research has pointed towards a \"significant\" surge in UFO sightings on Christmas Day, clocking in 75 reported cases for 2021. Chris Rutkowski from Ufology revealed: \"Most were simply lights in the sky, and yes, some were of a single red light flying overhead followed by a string of others.\", reports the Mirror.\n\nThere have indeed been historical reports of unidentified flying objects during the festive season dating back to Christmas 1965, with pioneering astronaut Wally Schirra Jr.\n\nAboard Gemini 6 observing an unusual \"object,\" he described at the time: \"We have an object, looks like a satellite going from north to south, probably in polar orbit. Looks like he might be going to re-enter soon [...] You just might let me pick up that thing.\"\n\nComplementing his account, fellow space savant Thomas Stafford observed: \"I see a command module and eight smaller modules in front. The pilot of the command module is wearing a red suit.\"\n\nWally and Thomas sent the control room into a spin with their claims of spotting something otherworldly during their space mission, but it turned out to be a festive prank. Wally whipped out his harmonica to play Jingle Bells, revealing the joke.\n\nMr Stafford recalled: \"Wally came up with the idea. He could play the harmonica, and we practised two or three times before we took off, but of course, we didn't tell the guys on the ground.\"\n\nDiscussing whether Christmas brings more UFO sightings, Ron James chimed in: \"My feeling is that there's not an actual increase in phenomenon occurring. It's more that there's more people in a position to see and experience things that might already be there pretty much consistently.\""

            "article_content": "While we wait for OpenAI\u2019s next big thing \u2014 presumably ChatGPT\u2019s GPT-5 model (or whatever it\u2019s called) \u2014 we might get to see and use another big upgrade for genAI products. AI agents are programs that let you manage and control Mac or Windows apps using written ChatGPT prompts and voice.\n\nThat\u2019s the future of AI computing I want from ChatGPT and similar AI products. I want to tell AI to look at my screen and do whatever I ask it to. I also want it to perform internet searches on my behalf, whether in the ChatGPT app or a browser. More importantly, I want to do most of it by voice, with the help of Advanced Voice Mode and future versions of it.\n\nOpenAI isn\u2019t quite there, but the demos the company showed during its penultimate \u201c12 Days\u201d announcement tell me we\u2019re heading in that direction.\n\nThe ChatGPT app for Mac now works with even more coding apps. OpenAI also added support for note-taking apps, including the Apple Notes app that comes on all Apple devices. The best part about it is that Advanced Voice Mode can be used to talk to ChatGPT about the contents on your screen.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nWe\u2019re still not getting full agentic functionality from ChatGPT. It\u2019s an iterative upgrade over what OpenAI announced about a month ago for the Mac app. At the time, the company gave ChatGPT the ability to look at the contents on the screen in certain coding apps on the Mac. The feature wasn\u2019t as much an agentic control of the computer as OpenAI leveraged a built-in accessibility API in macOS to read text.\n\nBut OpenAI has built on that, adding support for more coding apps, including Warp, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and others. As you can see in the short clips below, you can use the Mac app to instruct ChatGPT to look at the screen in a specific app. You\u2019ll be able to choose which app you\u2019re giving the AI access to, and that\u2019s the only thing it\u2019ll see.\n\nIn addition to expanding support to more apps, OpenAI is also bringing o1 and o1 pro mode to the mix of models that can be used to code for you. Advanced Voice Mode wasn\u2019t a part of these demos, as the OpenAI engineers still used text-based prompts to demo the new functionality.\n\nNow you can code with the power of o1 and o1 pro mode. pic.twitter.com/qdj9RuLRKQ \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 19, 2024\n\nThese updates aren\u2019t exciting if you don\u2019t code for a living. But you can already write all sorts of text. That\u2019s where ChatGPT might come in handy if you use a Mac. Here\u2019s where the Advanced Voice Mode feature shines.\n\nOpenAI showed a demo of ChatGPT\u2019s agentic behavior for note-taking apps. The list of supported apps includes Apple Notes, Notion, and Quip. The demo below shows ChatGPT looking at a Notion note to understand the context and answer a prompt. The AI then performs a search for factual information about a historic event and generates text trying to mimic the voice of the note\u2019s author.\n\nInstead of typing the prompts, you might want to talk to ChatGPT with Advanced Voice Mode rather than type your prompts. This might boost your productivity, assuming everything works as intended. As you\u2019ll see in the second demo, the AI quickly understands your needs, but it might fail here and there.\n\nAnd you can use Advanced Voice when you work with these apps. pic.twitter.com/drZoRc7xvC \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 19, 2024\n\nThen again, we\u2019re still in the early days here. What OpenAI has shown only scratches the surface of what ChatGPT might do one day on Mac and PC.\n\nUntil then, you can try these new ChatGPT capabilities in the Mac app as long as you have access to a premium tier (Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu). OpenAI will bring these features to the Windows app in the future. ChatGPT Free users will also get them next year."

Users in the US who previously downloaded Talkie from Apple's store can still access the app.\n\nTalkie's official TikTok account, which has 29,800 followers, has not published any updates this week after previously posting daily. In response to a series of user inquiries regarding its removal from the App Store, Talkie attributed the situation to \"technical reasons\".\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Shanghai-based MiniMax declined to comment on Friday.\n\nLaunched in June 2023, Talkie allows users to create and converse with personalised virtual characters through generative AI technology. It was the fourth-most downloaded app in the US in the first half of 2024, surpassing Google-backed rival Character.ai, which ranked 10th, according to data research firm Sensor Tower.\n\nGlobally, Talkie recorded 17 million downloads in the first eight months of the year, trailing Character.ai with nearly 19 million downloads, according to a Sensor Tower report in September. Talkie's monthly active users reached 11 million in July, with over half living in the US.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLinky AI, another AI companion app developed by Chinese tech firm Kunlun Tech, has also disappeared from the US App Store. The Shenzhen-listed company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\n\nFounded in 2021 by Yan Junjie, former vice-president of Chinese AI pioneer SenseTime, MiniMax secured US$600 million in a funding round in March led by Alibaba Group Holding, alongside prominent investors including HongShan, Hillhouse Investment and Matrix Partners, according to Itjuzi, a start-up database service. The unicorn was valued at US$2.5 billion at the time, according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\nOther big-name backers in previous financing rounds included Tencent Holdings, miHoYo and IDG Capital. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nMiniMax's revenue is expected to reach US$70 million this year, driven mainly by Talkie's advertising sales and in-app purchases, the Financial Times reported.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompanion AI apps are particularly popular among younger users, with those aged 18 to 35 accounting for more than 70 per cent of the user base for top apps that also include Linky AI and HiWaifu, according to Sensor Tower.\n\nTalkie's domestic twin Xingye garnered 5.25 million monthly active users as of November, ranking seventh among AI apps in China, according to data from AIcpb.com.\n\nIn an interview in August with Chinese media, MiniMax CEO Yan said Xingye \"is not like ChatGPT or Character.AI; it's a community where users can interact with each other based on AI-generated content\".\n\nIn August, MiniMax also ventured into the text-to-video generation space with the Video-01 AI model, which has since been made available on both the mainland and international web versions of the company's consumer-facing Hailuo AI platform. Earlier this month, MiniMax released an image-to-video model that produces animations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November, the overseas and domestic versions of Hailuo AI drew 16.35 million and 2.58 million visits, respectively, according to AIcpb.com.\n\nAmid an intensifying US-China tech war, in which AI has emerged as one of the key battlegrounds, many mainland-originated companies have sought to mask their origin over concerns of geopolitical risks.\n\nTalkie lists Singapore-registered company Subsup as its developer.

(\"5 ways Gemini can help during the Holidays\" is currently showing for me.) Search results on Google can also contain an \"AI Overview,\" which launched with some \"use glue for pizza sauce\" notoriety. People averse to AI answers can avoid them with URL parameters and proxy sites (or sticking to the \"web\" tab). Gemini has also been prominently added to other Google products, like Pixel phones, Gmail, and Drive/Workspace. And the search giant has also been testing the ability to attach files to a web search for analysis."

            "article_content": "Louise Stokes said there was paranormal acitvity in her council house and that objects flew out of a cupboard while she made food for her children. Photograph: iStock\n\nA woman has told the High Court she fears for the safety of her five young children due to \u201cparanormal activity\u201d that has caused tables and chairs to move at her newly provided council home.\n\nLouise and Thomas Stokes took a High Court case alleging they could not stay at their previous home in Mount Temple, Carrick-on-Shannon, Co Leitrim because of concerns for their children\u2019s health arising from a mould problem. The case was struck out on Friday.\n\nHowever, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Garrett Simons that a new property the family has been moved into by Leitrim County Council has caused her to be fearful for her children due to \u201cparanormal activity\u201d.\n\nThe family\u2019s original complaint to the High Court was that the local authority did not classify them as homeless even though it was alleged that mould in the first property was so bad had led to hospital visits and forced the entire family to sleep downstairs rather than in their bedrooms.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe claim against the council alleged that works were carried out to alleviate the situation by improving ventilation and removing the mould but the problem returned. Those works were insufficient, the family claimed, in arguing that the property was not fit for human habitation and emergency accommodation was needed.\n\nThe family alleged that in the five-year period they lived in the property, the problem with mould became so bad that they were forced to leave and live temporarily with relatives before returning. The court heard that the council placed the family on a transfer list and they accepted the offer of a new property in October.\n\nHowever, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Simons that since she has moved there \u201cnumerous objects\u201d in the new house have been \u201cflown from side to side\u201d, while doors and a table and chairs \u201cwere moving in front of our eyes\u201d. She said that while making food for her children, objects flew out of the cupboard she opened.\n\nMs Stokes said she contacted the previous occupant of the house, who wrote them a letter which the applicant described as \u201cbeyond traumatic\u201d. Ms Stokes claims she brought the letter to the attention of the council but was \u201claughed at\u201d during a meeting.\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves a home. I never asked for a mansion, I asked for a safe home for my kids. I just want somewhere safe for my kids five days before Christmas,\u201d she said.\n\nMr Justice Simons struck out the family\u2019s claim against the council, which he said only related to the first property. He said the only case before him was in relation to the first house and that \u201cthe case has come and gone, as it were\u201d due to the family\u2019s move.\n\nHe told Ms Stokes he understood her concern about the second house experiencing \u201cparanormal activity\u201d and her fears for the safety of her children, but that a third house would mean a new application to the local authority."

            "article_content": "You've almost certainly put lettuce on a burger, but what if a type of seaweed called sea lettuce was the burger.\n\nResearchers at the Chalmers University of Technology have high hopes for just that after unveiling a method to extract three times more protein from sea lettuce than a conventional burger. They published their findings in the Food Chemistry journal, via Science Direct, and pointed to a number of potential uses for the flavorful seaweed, as VegNews detailed.\n\nThe overall problem the researchers were looking to address was creating alternatives to land-based protein sources, whether that be meat, dairy, or plant-based. Seaweed provides a promising solution. It can grow well in a variety of conditions without fertilizers, watering, or insecticides.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Humanity will need to find and combine the intake of many more diversified protein sources than we have available in our diet today to meet sustainability and nutritional requirements,\" said Ingrid Undeland, a professor of food science at Chalmers, in a news release.\n\nThe research team said that its new method of extracting protein makes it more affordable and comparable to the process for pea and soy proteins. Sea lettuce is also rich in vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids. As far as the taste, the scientists were bullish that there were tons of applications for it.\n\n\"It tastes like umami with a certain salty flavor, despite not containing such high levels of salt,\" said researcher Jo\u00e3o Trigo of a concentrate of the sea lettuce proteins. Trigo said the powder would be a \"great flavor enhancer for seafood dishes and products\" but dreamed bigger down the road.\n\n\"Why not protein smoothies or 'blue burgers' from the sea?\" Trigo asked.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that were to come to fruition, it would provide another alternative to animal-based protein sources. That could be important for the health of humans and the health of the planet, as research has clearly shown the benefits of plant-based diets.\n\nOn the human health side, a recent study said reducing red-meat consumption by 30% could save over 45,000 lives in a 10-year span. Those sorts of health benefits were also seen in a study featuring identical twins when the twins on the vegan diet saw major improvements in key health metrics.\n\nWhy do you eat plant-based foods?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nAs far as the planet's health, another study revealed switching away from red meat and dairy-based diets to plant-based ones could reduce greenhouse gases by 17%. The Guardian also explored a study that showed how much climate damage and resource usage could be cut down with plant-based diets.\n\nThe Chalmers University team said it is also working to boost the protein content in the seaweed by growing it in processed water used by the seafood industry. It also hopes to use the nonprotein parts of the sea lettuce for food, medical, and material applications.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, when it comes to food sources, Undeland noted that \"sea-based possibilities\" or \"blue proteins\" have so far been \"overlooked.\"\n\n\"Algae is a good addition to many of the products already on the market,\" Undeland concluded.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "OpenAI saved its biggest announcement for the last day of its 12-day \u201cshipmas\u201d event.\n\nOn Friday, the company unveiled o3, the successor to the o1 \u201creasoning\u201d model it released earlier in the year. o3 is a model family, to be more precise \u2014 as was the case with o1. There\u2019s o3 and o3-mini, a smaller, distilled model fine-tuned for particular tasks.\n\nOpenAI makes the remarkable claim that o3, at least in certain conditions, approaches AGI \u2014 with significant caveats. More on that below.\n\nWhy call the new model o3, not o2? Well, trademarks may be to blame. According to The Information, OpenAI skipped o2 to avoid a potential conflict with British telecom provider O2. CEO Sam Altman somewhat confirmed this during a livestream this morning. Strange world we live in, isn\u2019t it?\n\nNeither o3 nor o3-mini are widely available yet, but safety researchers can sign up for a preview for o3-mini starting today. An o3 preview will arrive sometime after; OpenAI didn\u2019t specify when. Altman said that the plan is to launch o3-mini toward the end of January and follow with o3.\n\nThat conflicts a bit with his recent statements. In an interview this week, Altman said that, before OpenAI releases new reasoning models, he\u2019d prefer a federal testing framework to guide monitoring and mitigating the risks of such models.\n\nAnd there are risks. AI safety testers have found that o1\u2019s reasoning abilities make it try to deceive human users at a higher rate than conventional, \u201cnon-reasoning\u201d models \u2014 or, for that matter, leading AI models from Meta, Anthropic, and Google. It\u2019s possible that o3 attempts to deceive at an even higher rate than its predecessor; we\u2019ll find out once OpenAI\u2019s red-team partners release their testing results.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, OpenAI says that it\u2019s using a new technique, \u201cdeliberative alignment,\u201d to align models like o3 with its safety principles. (o1 was aligned the same way.) The company has detailed its work in a new study.\n\nReasoning steps\n\nUnlike most AI, reasoning models such as o3 effectively fact-check themselves, which helps them to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models.\n\nThis fact-checking process incurs some latency. o3, like o1 before it, takes a little longer \u2014 usually seconds to minutes longer \u2014 to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside? It tends to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and mathematics.\n\no3 was trained via reinforcement learning to \u201cthink\u201d before responding via what OpenAI describes as a \u201cprivate chain of thought.\u201d The model can reason through a task and plan ahead, performing a series of actions over an extended period that help it figure out a solution.\n\nWe announced @OpenAI o1 just 3 months ago. Today, we announced o3. We have every reason to believe this trajectory will continue. pic.twitter.com/Ia0b63RXIk \u2014 Noam Brown (@polynoamial) December 20, 2024\n\nIn practice, given a prompt, o3 pauses before responding, considering a number of related prompts and \u201cexplaining\u201d its reasoning along the way. After a while, the model summarizes what it considers to be the most accurate response.\n\nNew with o3 versus o1 is the ability to \u201cadjust\u201d the reasoning time. The models can be set to low, medium, or high compute (i.e. thinking time). The higher the compute, the better o3 performs on a task.\n\nNo matter how much compute they have at their disposals, reasoning models such as o3 aren\u2019t flawless, however. While the reasoning component can reduce hallucinations and errors, it doesn\u2019t eliminate them. o1 trips up on games of tic-tac-toe, for instance.\n\nBenchmarks and AGI\n\nOne big question leading up to today was whether OpenAI might claim that its newest models are approaching AGI.\n\nAGI, short for \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d broadly refers to AI that can perform any task a human can. OpenAI has its own definition: \u201chighly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d\n\nAchieving AGI would be a bold declaration. And it carries contractual weight for OpenAI, as well. According to the terms of its deal with close partner and investor Microsoft, once OpenAI reaches AGI, it\u2019s no longer obligated to give Microsoft access to its most advanced technologies (those that meet OpenAI\u2019s AGI definition, that is).\n\nGoing by one benchmark, OpenAI is slowly inching closer to AGI. On ARC-AGI, a test designed to evaluate whether an AI system can efficiently acquire new skills outside the data it was trained on, o3 achieved an 87.5% score on the high compute setting. At its worst (on the low compute setting), the model tripled the performance of o1.\n\nGranted, the high compute setting was exceedingly expensive \u2014 in the order of thousands of dollars per challenge, according to ARC-AGI co-creator Fran\u00e7ois Chollet.\n\nChollet also pointed out that o3 fails on \u201cvery easy tasks\u201d in ARC-AGI, indicating \u2014 in his opinion \u2014 that the model exhibits \u201cfundamental differences\u201d from human intelligence. He has previously noted the evaluation\u2019s limitations, and cautioned against using it as a measure of AI superintelligence.\n\n\u201c[E]arly data points suggest that the upcoming [successor to the ARC-AGI] benchmark will still pose a significant challenge to o3, potentially reducing its score to under 30% even at high compute (while a smart human would still be able to score over 95% with no training),\u201d Chollet continued in a statement. \u201cYou\u2019ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible.\u201d\n\nIncidentally, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll partner with the foundation behind ARC-AGI to help it build the next generation of its AI benchmark, ARC-AGI 2.\n\nOn other tests, o3 blows away the competition.\n\nThe model outperforms o1 by 22.8 percentage points on SWE-Bench Verified, a benchmark focused on programming tasks, and achieves a Codeforces rating \u2014 another measure of coding skills \u2014 of 2727. (A rating of 2400 places an engineer at the 99.2nd percentile.) o3 scores 96.7% on the 2024 American Invitational Mathematics Exam, missing just one question, and achieves 87.7% on GPQA Diamond, a set of graduate-level biology, physics, and chemistry questions. Finally, o3 sets a new record on EpochAI\u2019s Frontier Math benchmark, solving 25.2% of problems; no other model exceeds 2%.\n\nThese claims have to be taken with a grain of salt, of course. They\u2019re from OpenAI\u2019s internal evaluations. We\u2019ll need to wait to see how the model holds up to benchmarking from outside customers and organizations in the future.\n\nA trend\n\nIn the wake of the release of OpenAI\u2019s first series of reasoning models, there\u2019s been an explosion of reasoning models from rival AI companies \u2014 including Google. In early November, DeepSeek, an AI research firm funded by quant traders, launched a preview of its first reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1. That same month, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen team unveiled what it claimed was the first \u201copen\u201d challenger to o1 (in the sense that it could be downloaded, fine-tuned, and run locally).\n\nWhat opened the reasoning model floodgates? Well, for one, the search for novel approaches to refine generative AI. As TechCrunch recently reported, \u201cbrute force\u201d techniques to scale up models are no longer yielding the improvements they once did.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s convinced that reasoning models are the best path forward. They tend to be expensive, for one, thanks to the large amount of computing power required to run them. And while they\u2019ve performed well on benchmarks so far, it\u2019s not clear whether reasoning models can maintain this rate of progress.\n\nInterestingly, the release of o3 comes as one of OpenAI\u2019s most accomplished scientists departs. Alec Radford, the lead author of the academic paper that kicked off OpenAI\u2019s \u201cGPT series\u201d of generative AI models (that is, GPT-3, GPT-4, and so on), announced this week that he\u2019s leaving to pursue independent research.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

            "article_content": "OpenAI today announced an improved version of its most capable artificial intelligence model to date\u2014one that takes even more time to deliberate over questions\u2014just a day after Google announced its first model of this type.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s new model, called o3, replaces o1, which the company introduced in September. Like o1, the new model spends time ruminating over a problem in order to deliver better answers to questions that require step-by-step logical reasoning. (OpenAI chose to skip the \u201co2\u201d moniker because it's already the name of a mobile carrier in the UK.)\n\n\u201cWe view this as the beginning of the next phase of AI,\u201d said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on a livestream Friday. \u201cWhere you can use these models to do increasingly complex tasks that require a lot of reasoning.\u201d\n\nThe o3 model scores much higher on several measures than its predecessor, OpenAI says, including ones that measure complex coding-related skills and advanced math and science competency. It is three times better than o1 at answering questions posed by ARC-AGI, a benchmark designed to test an AI models\u2019 ability to reason over extremely difficult mathematical and logic problems they\u2019re encountering for the first time.\n\nGoogle is pursuing a similar line of research. Noam Shazeer, a Google researcher, yesterday revealed in a post on X that the company has developed its own reasoning model, called Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. Google\u2019s CEO, Sundar Pichai, called it \u201cour most thoughtful model yet\u201d in his own post. Google\u2019s new model achieved a high score on SWE-Bench, a test that measures a models\u2019 agentic abilities.\n\nHowever, OpenAI\u2019s new o3 model is 20 percent better than o1. \u201co3 blew it out of the water,\u201d says Ofir Press, a post-doctoral researcher at Princeton University who helped develop SWE-Bench. \u201cVery surprising increase, not sure how they did it.\u201d\n\nThe two dueling models show competition between OpenAI and Google to be fiercer than ever. It is crucial for OpenAI to demonstrate that it can keep making advances as it seeks to attract more investment and build a profitable business. Google is meanwhile desperate to show that it remains at the forefront of AI research.\n\nThe new models also show how AI companies are increasingly looking beyond simply scaling up AI models in order to wring greater intelligence out of them."

            "article_content": "NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nWith the holiday season upon us, many companies are finding ways to take advantage through deals, promotions, or other campaigns. OpenAI has found a way to participate with its \"12 days of OpenAI\" event series.\n\nOpenAI announced via an X post that starting on Dec. 5, the company would host 12 days of live streams and release \"a bunch of new things, big and small,\" according to the post. The company saved the best for last, sharing its biggest annoouncemnt on Friday, Dec. 20, the last day of the series.\n\nAlso: I'm a ChatGPT power user - here's why Canvas is its best productivity feature\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the campaign, as well as a round-up of every day's drops.\n\nWhat are the '12 days of OpenAI'?\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared more details about the event, which kicked off at 10 a.m. PT on Dec. 5 and occurred daily for 12 weekdays with a live stream featuring a launch or demo. The launches included both \"big ones\" or \"stocking stuffers,\" according to Altman.\n\nWhat's dropped?\n\nFriday, December 20\n\nOn the last day of OpenAI, OpenAI unveiled its latest models, o3, which encompass o3 and o3 mini.\n\nAs previously reported, the reason for the name that skips \"o2\" is the existence of Telefonica's O2 telecommunications brand, which could cause confusion and copyright issues.\n\nOpenAI said that the technology will not be available to the general public yet.\n\no3 can outperform o1 in a variety of benchmarks, including math and science, as seen in its performance on the AIME 2024, a competition math benchmark, and the GPQA, a Ph.D. level science benchmark with biology, physics, and chemistry questions.\n\no3 also scored a new state-of-the-art score on the ARC-AGI benchmark, which is significant because it shows the model is nearing AGI, although, to be clear, it is not there yet.\n\no3 mini is a new model in the o3 family that will support three reasoning options: low, medium, and high. The thinking time determines the performance. At a low level, it performs the same as o1-mini on the Codeforces Competition Code benchmark, but at medium and high, it can perform comparable to o1, if not better. This performance remained consistent across other evals.\n\nIn addition to internal safety testing, OpenAI is, for the first time, opening up the o3 models to external safety testing. Safety researchers can get early access to the model by filling out a form on the OpenAI website, which will be open until January 10.\n\nSam Altman concluded the live stream by sharing that the o3 model is planned to launch at the end of January, and the full o3 model will be launched after that.\n\nThe company also introduced deliberative alignment, \"a training paradigm that directly teaches reasoning LLMs the text of human-written and interpretable safety specifications, and trains them to reason explicitly about these specifications before answering,\" according to OpenAI.\n\nThursday, December 19\n\nOn the second to last day of '12 days of OpenAI,' the company focused on releases regarding its MacOS desktop app and its interoperability with other apps.\n\nUsers can now use the desktop app on MacOS to see and automate their work with ChatGPT. There will be more releases of this nature in 2025, but until then, OpenAI has been introducing the three features below.\n\nUsing the \"Work with Apps\" button, users can now work with many more coding apps. The list includes: BBEdit, MatLab, Nova, Script Editor, TextMate, Android Studio, AppCode, CLion, DataGrip, GoLand, IntelliJ IDEA, PHPStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, RustRover, WebStorm, Prompt, and Warp.\n\nFor users who use ChatGPT for writing, the desktop app now supports Apple Notes, Quip, and Notion.\n\nLastly, the desktop app for MacOS now supports Advanced Voice Mode while working with other apps.\n\nFeatures have already been shipped. All you have to do is have the latest version of the MacOS app and a Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu subscription.\n\nTo ease privacy concerns, OpenAI says ChatGPT will only work with apps when manually prompted. When the feature is active, users know what will be attached to the message.\n\n\"Day 12, we have something super special, so don't miss it,\" teased OpenAI about its upcoming Friday release.\n\nWednesday, December 18\n\nHave you ever wanted to use ChatGPT without a Wi-Fi connection? Now, all you have to do is place a phone call. Here's what OpenAI released on the 10th day:\n\nBy dialing 1-800-ChatGPT, you can now access the chatbot via a toll-free number. OpenAI encourages users to save ChatGPT in their contacts for easy access.\n\nUsers can call anywhere in the US; in other countries, users can message ChatGPT on WhatsApp. Users get 15 minutes of free ChatGPT calls per month.\n\nIn WhatsApp, users can enter a prompt via a text as they would with any other person in their contacts. In this experience, it is just a text message.\n\nThe phone call feature works on any phone, from a smartphone to a flip phone -- even a rotary phone.\n\nThe presenters said it is meant to make ChatGPT more accessible to more users.\n\nTuesday, December 17\n\nThe releases on the ninth day all focus on developer features and updates, dubbed \"Mini Dev Day.\" These launches include:\n\nThe o1 model is finally out of preview in the API with support for function calling, structured outputs, developer messages, vision capabilities, and lower latency, according to the company.\n\no1 in the API also features a new parameter: \"reasoning effort.\" This parameter allows developers to tell the model how much effort is put into formulating an answer, which helps with cost efficiency.\n\nOpenAI also introduced WebRTC support for the Realtime API, which makes it easier for developers \"to build and scale real-time voice products across platforms.\"\n\nThe Realtime API also got a 60% audio token price drop, support for GPT-4o mini, and more control over responses.\n\nThe fine-tuning API now supports Preference Fine-Tuning, which allows users to \"Optimize the model to favor desired behavior by reinforcing preferred responses and reducing the likelihood of unpreferred ones,\" according to OpenAI.\n\n\n\nOpenAI also introduced new Go and Java SDKs in beta.\n\nAn \"AMA\" (ask me anything) session will be held for an hour after the live stream on the OpenAI GitHub platform with the presenters.\n\nMonday, December 16\n\nThe drops for the second Monday in the 12 days of OpenAI series all focused on Search in ChatGPT.\n\nThe AI search engine is available to all users starting today, including all free users who are signed in anywhere they can access ChatGPT. The feature was previously only available to ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nThe search experience, which allows users to browse the web from ChatGPT, got faster and better on mobile and now has an enriched map experience. The upgrades include image-rich visual results.\n\nSearch is integrated into Advance Voice mode, meaning you can now search as you talk to ChatGPT. To activate this feature, just activate Advance Voice the same way you regularly would and ask it your query verbally. It will then answer your query verbally by pulling from the web.\n\nOpenAI also teased developers, saying, \"Tomorrow is for you,\" and calling the upcoming livestream a \"mini Dev Day.\"\n\nFriday, December 13\n\nOne of OpenAI's most highly requested features has been an organizational feature to better keep track of your conversations. On Friday, OpenAI delivered a new feature called \"Projects.\"\n\nProjects is a new way to organize and customize your chats in ChatGPT, meant to be a part of continuing to optimize the core experience of ChatGPT.\n\nWhen creating a Project, you can include a title, a customized folder color, relevant project files, instructions for ChatGPT on how it can best help you with the project, and more in one place.\n\nIn the Project, you can start a chat and add previous chats from the sidebar to your Project. It can also answer questions using your context in a regular chat format. The chats can be saved in the Project, making it easier to pick up your conversations later and know exactly what to look for where.\n\nIt will be rolled out to Plus, Pro, and Teams users starting today. OpenAI says it's coming to free users as soon as possible. Enterprise and Edu users will see it rolled out early next year.\n\nThursday, December 12\n\nWhen the live stream started, OpenAI addressed the elephant in the room -- the fact that the company's live stream went down the day before. OpenAI apologized for the inconvenience and said its team is working on a post-mortem to be posted later.\n\nThen it got straight into the news -- another highly-anticipated announcement:\n\nAdvanced Voice Mode now has screen-sharing and visual capabilities, meaning it can assist with the context of what it is viewing, whether that be from your phone camera or what's on your screen.\n\nThese capabilities build on what Advanced Voice could already do very well -- engaging in casual conversation as a human would. The natural-like conversations can be interrupted, have multi-turns, and understand non-linear trains of thought.\n\nIn the demo, the user gets directions from ChatGPT's Advanced Voice on how to make a cup of coffee. As the demoer goes through the steps, ChatGPT is verbally offering insights and directions.\n\nThere's another bonus for the Christmas season: Users can access a new Santa voice. To activate it, all users have to do is click on the snowflake icon. Santa is rolling out throughout today everywhere that users can access ChatGPT voice mode. The first time you talk to Santa, your usage limits reset, even if you have reached the limit already, so you can have a conversation with him.\n\nVideo and screen sharing are rolling out in the latest mobile apps starting today and throughout next week to all Team users and most Pro and Plus subscribers. Pro and Plus subscribers in Europe will get access \"as soon as we can,\" and Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next year.\n\nWednesday, December 11\n\nApple released iOS 18.2 on Wednesday. The release includes integrations with ChatGPT across Siri, Writing Tools, and Visual Intelligence. As a result, the live stream focused on walking through the integration.\n\nSiri can now recognize when you ask questions outside its scope that could benefit from being answered by ChatGPT instead. In those instances, it will ask if you'd like to process the query using ChatGPT. Before any request is sent to ChatGPT, a message notifying the user and asking for permission will always appear, placing control in the user's hands as much as possible.\n\n\n\nVisual Intelligence refers to a new feature for the iPhone 16 lineup that users can access by tapping the Camera Control button. Once the camera is open, users can point it at something and search the web with Google, or use ChatGPT to learn more about what they are viewing or perform other tasks such as translating or summarizing text.\n\nWriting Tools now features a new \"Compose\" tool, which allows users to create text from scratch by leveraging ChatGPT. With the feature, users can even generate images using DALL-E.\n\nAll of the above features are subject to ChatGPT's daily usage limits, the same way that users would reach limits while using the free version of the model on ChatGPT. Users can choose whether or not to enable the ChatGPT integration in Settings.\n\nRead more about it here: iOS 18.2 rolls out to iPhones: Try these 6 new AI features today\n\nTuesday, December 10\n\nCanvas is coming to all web users, regardless of plan, in GPT-4o, meaning it is no longer just available in beta for ChatGPT Plus users.\n\nCanvas has been built into GPT-4o natively, meaning you can just call on Canvas instead of having to go to the toggle on the model selector.\n\nThe Canvas interface is the same as what users saw in beta in ChatGPT Plus, with a table on the left hand side that shows the Q+A exchange and a right-hand tab that shows your project, displaying all of the edits as they go, as well as shortcuts.\n\nCanvas can also be used with custom GPTs. It is turned on by default when creating a new one, and there is an option to add Canvas to existing GPTs.\n\nCanvas also has the ability to run Python code directly in Canvas, allowing ChatGPT to execute coding tasks such as fixing bugs.\n\nRead more about it here: I'm a ChatGPT power user - and Canvas is still my favorite productivity feature a month later\n\nMonday, December 9\n\nOpenAI teased the third-day announcement as \"something you've been waiting for,\" followed by the much-anticipated drop of its video model -- Sora. Here's what you need to know:\n\nKnown as Sora Turbo, the video model is smarter than the February model that was previewed.\n\nAccess is coming in the US later today; users need only ChatGPT Plus and Pro.\n\nSora can generate video-to-video, text-to-video, and more.\n\nChatGPT Plus users can generate up to 50 videos per month at 480p resolution or fewer videos at 720p. The Pro Plan offers 10x more usage.\n\nThe new model is smarter and cheaper than the previewed February model.\n\nSora features an explore page where users can view each other's creations. Users can click on any video to see how it was created.\n\nA live demo showed the model in use. The demo-ers entered a prompt and picked aspect ratio, duration, and even presets. I found the live demo video results to be realistic and stunning.\n\nOpenAI also unveiled Storyboard, a tool that lets users generate inputs for every frame in a sequence.\n\nFriday, December 6:\n\nOn the second day of \"shipmas,\" OpenAI expanded access to its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research Program:\n\nThe Reinforcement Fine-Tuning program allows developers and machine learning engineers to fine-tune OpenAI models to \"excel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks,\" according to OpenAI.\n\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning refers to a customization technique in which developers can define a model's behavior by inputting tasks and grading the output. The model then uses this feedback as a guide to improve, becoming better at reasoning through similar problems, and enhancing overall accuracy.\n\nOpenAI encourages research institutes, universities, and enterprises to apply to the program, particularly those that perform narrow sets of complex tasks, could benefit from the assistance of AI, and perform tasks that have an objectively correct answer.\n\nSpots are limited; interested applicants can apply by filling out this form.\n\nOpenAI aims to make Reinforcement Fine-Tuning publicly available in early 2025.\n\nThursday, December 5:\n\nOpenAI started with a bang, unveiling two major upgrades to its chatbot: a new tier of ChatGPT subscription, ChatGPT Pro, and the full version of the company's o1 model.\n\nThe full version of o1:\n\nWill be better for all kinds of prompts, beyond math and science\n\nWill make major mistakes about 34% less often than o1-preview, while thinking about 50% faster\n\nRolls out today, replacing o1-preview to all ChatGPT Plus and now Pro users\n\nLets users input images, as seen in the demo, to provide multi-modal reasoning (reasoning on both text and images)\n\nChatGPT Pro:\n\nIs meant for ChatGPT Plus superusers, granting them unlimited access to the best OpenAI has to offer, including unlimited access to OpenAI o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Mode\n\nFeatures o1 pro mode, which uses more computing to reason through the hardest science and math problems\n\nCosts $200 per month\n\nWhere can you access the live stream?\n\nThe live streams were held on the OpenAI website, and posted to its YouTube channel immediately after. So if you missed the 12 days of OpenAI and want to rewatch, you can access them all on the company's YouTube channel."

First, the company revealed the full-function version of its new o1 family of reasoning models and announced that they would be immediately available, albeit in limited amounts, to its $20/month Plus tier subscribers. In order to get full use of the new model (as well as every other model that OpenAI offers, plus unlimited access to Advanced Voice Mode), users will need to spring for OpenAI\u2019s newest, and highest, subscription package: the $200/month Pro tier.\n\nDay 2: OpenAI expands its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research program\n\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning\u201412 Days of OpenAI: Day 2\n\nOn the event\u2019s second day, the OpenAI development team announced that it is expanding its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research program, which allows developers to train the company\u2019s models as subject matter experts that \u201cexcel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks,\u201d according to the program\u2019s website. Though it is geared more toward institutes, universities, and enterprises than individual users, the company plans to make the program\u2019s API available to the public early next year.\n\nDay 3: OpenAI\u2019s Sora video generator has finally arrived. Huzzah?\n\nSora\u201312 Days of OpenAI: Day 3\n\nOn the third day of OpenAI, Sam Altman gave to me: Sora video generation. Yeah, OK, so the cadence for that doesn\u2019t quite work but hey, neither does Sora. OpenAI\u2019s long-awaited and highly touted video generation model, which has been heavily hyped since February, made its official debut on December 9 to middling reviews. Turns out that two years into the AI boom, being the leading company in the space and only rolling out 20-second clips at 1080p doesn\u2019t really move the needle, especially when many of its competitors already offer similar performance without requiring a $20- or $200-per-month subscription.\n\nDay 4: OpenAI expands its Canvas\n\nCanvas\u201412 Days of OpenAI: Day 4\n\nOpenAI followed up its Sora revelations with a set of improvements to its recently released Canvas feature, the company\u2019s answer to Anthropic\u2019s Artifacts. During its Day 4 live stream, the OpenAI development team revealed that Canvas will now be integrated directly into the GPT-4o model, making it natively available to users at all price tiers, including free. You can now run Python code directly within the Canvas space, enabling the chatbot to analyze it directly and offer suggestions for improvement, as well as use the feature to construct custom GPTs.\n\nDay 5: ChatGPT teams up with Apple Intelligence\n\nChatGPT x Apple Intelligence\u201412 Days of OpenAI: Day 5\n\nOn day five, OpenAI announced that it is working with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence, specifically Siri, allowing users to invoke the chatbot directly through iOS. Apple had announced that this would be a thing back when it first unveiled Apple Intelligence but, with the release of iOS 18.2, that functionality is now a reality. If only Apple\u2019s users actually wanted to use Apple\u2019s AI.\n\nDay 6: Advanced Voice Mode now has the power of sight and can speak Santa\n\nSanta Mode & Video in Advanced Voice\u201412 Days of OpenAI: Day 6\n\n2024 was the year that Advanced Voice Mode got its eyes. OpenAI announced on Day 6 of its live-stream event that its conversational chatbot model can now view the world around it through a mobile device\u2019s video camera or via screen sharing. This will enable users to ask the AI questions about their surroundings without having to describe the scene or upload a photo of what they\u2019re looking at. The company also released a seasonal voice for AVM which mimics Jolly Old St. Nick, just in case you don\u2019t have time to drive your kids to the mall and meet the real one in person.\n\nDay 7: OpenAI introduces Projects for ChatGPT\n\nProjects\u201412 Days of OpenAI: Day 7\n\nOpenAI closed out the first week of announcements with one that is sure to bring a smile to the face of every boy and girl: folders! Specifically, the company revealed its new smart folder system, dubbed \u201cProjects,\u201d which allows users to better organize their chat histories and uploaded documents by subject.\n\nDay 8: ChatGPT Search is now available to everybody\n\nSearch\u201412 Days of OpenAI: Day 8\n\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Search function, which debuted in October, is now available to all logged-in users, regardless of their subscription tier. The feature works by searching the internet for information about the user\u2019s query, scraping the info it finds from relevant websites, and then synthesize that data into a conversational answer. It essentially eliminates the need to click through a search results page and is functionally identical to what Perplexity AI offers, allowing ChatGPT to compete with the increasingly popular app. Be warned, however: a recent study has shown the feature to be \u201cconfidently wrong\u201d in many of its answers.\n\nDay 9: the full o1 model comes to OpenAI\u2019s API\n\nDev Day Holiday Edition\u201412 Days of OpenAI: Day 9\n\nLike being gifted a sweater from not one but two aunts, OpenAI revealed on day nine that it is allowing select developers to access the full version of its o1 reasoning model through the API. The company is also rolling out real-time API updates, a new model customization technique called Preference Fine-Tuning, and new SDKs for Go and Java.\n\nDay 10: 1-800-ChatGPT\n\n1-800-CHAT-GPT\u201412 Days of OpenAI: Day 10\n\nIn an effort to capture that final market segment that it couldn\u2019t already reach \u2014 specifically, people without internet access \u2014 OpenAI has released the 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478) chatline. Dial in from any land or mobile number within the U.S. to speak with the AI\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode for up to 15 minutes for free.\n\nDay 11: ChatGPT now works with even more coding apps\n\nWork with Apps\u201412 Days of OpenAI: Day 11\n\nLast month, OpenAI granted the Mac-based desktop version of ChatGPT the ability to interface directly with a number of popular coding applications, allowing its AI to pull snippets directly from them rather than require users to copy and paste the code into its chatbot\u2019s prompt window. On Thursday, the company announced that it is drastically expanding the number of apps and IDEs that ChatGPT can collaborate with. And it\u2019s not just coding apps; ChatGPT now also works with conventional text programs like Apple Notes, Notion, and Quip. You can even launch Advanced Voice Mode in a separate window as you work, asking questions and getting suggestions from the AI about your current project.\n\nDay 12: OpenAI teases its upcoming o3 and o3-mini reasoning models\n\nOpenAI o3 and o3-mini\u201412 Days of OpenAI: Day 12\n\nFor the 12th day of OpenAI\u2019s live-stream event, CEO Sam Altman made a final appearance to discuss what the company has in store for the new year \u2014 specifically, its next-generation reasoning models, o3 and o3-mini. The naming scheme is a bit odd (and done to avoid copyright issues with U.K. telecom, O2) but the upcoming models reportedly offer superior performance on some of the industry\u2019s most challenging math, science, and coding benchmark tests \u2014 even compared to o1, the full version of which was formally released less than a fortnight ago. The company is currently offering o3-mini as a preview to researchers for safety testing and red teaming trials, though there\u2019s no word yet on when everyday users will be able to try the models for themselves."

            "article_content": "When looking to build or renovate your home or office, looking at emerging trends can inspire a project with long-term utility and timeless style. Trends in the New Hampshire construction industry include efforts toward greener designs and increased energy efficiency, which keep the overall maintenance costs and energy use down. Our panel shares their insights into the specifics they are seeing in their work.\n\nPanelists:\n\nDylan R. Cruess, Chief Operating Officer, TF Moran Inc., tfmoran.com\n\nJeremy Baldwin, AIA and Multifamily Studio Lead, Maugel DeStefano Architects, maugel.com\n\nDylan R. Cruess, Chief Operating Officer, TF Moran Inc.\n\nWhat are the emerging trends shaping the construction industry? How can businesses align their strategies with these developments for a competitive edge?\n\nAs with many industries, technology is pushing and shaping the construction industry from the design to the actual construction. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is becoming much more common and accepted in design and construction projects. With BIM, you can create a 3D computer model of the entire project including the parking areas, utility connections and building construction, which allows owners, engineers and contractors to visualize the final development and detect any conflicts before construction. To gain a competitive edge, businesses should always be looking at how technology is affecting their industry and should aim to be ahead of their competitors in adopting new technology.\n\nAmid evolving environmental concerns, how are sustainability practices influencing construction projects, and what are the key considerations for businesses looking to adopt eco-conscious approaches?\n\nSustainability practices have long been a focus in civil engineering design and construction. In the early to mid-2000s, there was a big push for LEED Certification which was a way to demonstrate that a development went above and beyond the construction requirements for sustainability. Since the 2000s, municipal regulations and building codes have been revised to incorporate many of LEED Certification\u2019s sustainability requirements, so it is now common practice in the construction industry to minimize environmental impacts and focus on sustainability.\n\nIn the context of urbanization and infrastructure growth, what role does innovative project management play in ensuring the successful execution of complex construction endeavors, and how can businesses excel in this area?\n\nFor urbanization and infrastructure growth, project management and future development planning are absolutely critical. My firm is involved in several large mixed-use developments that require substantial expansion of existing sewer, water, stormwater and electrical systems. When considering expansion of existing infrastructure, the existing systems\u2019 total capacity and connection points need to be considered as well as what additional demands a new development will place on existing systems.\n\nWith a focus on safety and regulatory compliance, what steps should businesses take to mitigate risks and ensure the well-being of workers and stakeholders in construction projects?\n\nSafety and regulatory compliance start with a company culture that prioritizes safety. My firm tells our field personnel that they can always say \u201cno\u201d to any task in the field if they have any safety concerns. Additionally, focusing on safety equipment is paramount in promoting a safe work environment. The cost of safety equipment and gear is negligible compared to the lost time and medical expenses of a workplace injury or safety incident.\n\nJeremy Baldwin, AIA and Multifamily Studio Lead Maugel DeStefano Architects\n\nAs the construction industry looks ahead to new mechanical code changes, refrigerant requirements have become a hot topic of conversation. These regulations could significantly impact mechanical designs for future projects, and staying ahead of the curve is critical. Here\u2019s a quick look at what\u2019s driving these changes, why they matter, and how you can prepare.\n\nWhy are refrigerants being phased down?\n\nThe phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) under the 2020 AIM Act is the centerpiece of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. HFCs are commonly found in refrigerants like R-410A, and they have a high global warming potential. The goal is to reduce HFC usage by 85% by 2036, requiring a shift toward more sustainable refrigerant options such as A2L refrigerants.\n\nHow will the new regulations impact mechanical design?\n\nThis phasedown represents a significant shift in how mechanical systems are designed. While A2L refrigerants offer environmental benefits and improved efficiency, they also introduce unique challenges:\n\nR-410A is being phased out. The current refrigerant standard for HVAC systems, R-410A, will be replaced by A2L refrigerants with lower HFC\u2019s.\n\nA2L refrigerants will be the new standard. These refrigerants have lower global warming potential, greater energy efficiency, making them a more sustainable choice. However, A2L is mildly flammable (Class 2), which requires updated safety measures.\n\nNew safety requirements for HVAC designs. Refrigerant lines that penetrate more than one floor or ceiling assembly will need ventilated shafts, either natural or mechanical. Exceptions may apply for smaller systems serving single units.\n\nWhat are the new requirements?\n\nA2L refrigerants will be the standard for new HVAC, refrigeration and heat pump systems.\n\nRated shafts will be required for refrigerant lines passing through multiple floors to address flammability concerns.\n\nExisting systems using R-410A will be allowed to remain in use until January 1, 2026, but manufacturers are already phasing out the production of R-410A systems. Replacement parts and repair options for older systems will become increasingly scarce.\n\nWhy do these new changes matter?\n\nTransitioning to A2L refrigerants will help the construction industry achieve environmental goals without compromising performance. However, the shift introduces complexities in design, safety and installation that developers, engineers and contractors must navigate. Additionally, some states have already implemented requirements for mechanical ventilation and emergency backup power for these rated shafts.\n\nHow is Maugel DeStefano Architects preparing?\n\nAs architects, we are committed to guiding our clients through this transition. Our approach includes:\n\nClose collaboration with suppliers. We\u2019re coordinating with vendors to ensure a smooth switch to A2L systems, establishing timelines and evaluating integration with existing designs.\n\nProject-by-project assessments. Each project is analyzed to incorporate energy codes, compliance requirements, and HVAC system options for maximum efficiency and safety.\n\nClient education. We\u2019re keeping clients informed about these changes, advising on long-term costs and addressing compatibility issues between older and newer systems.\n\nOur priority is to ensure that developers, contractors, engineers and policymakers understand how these new regulations will shape future projects. By proactively addressing these changes, we aim to deliver compliant, efficient and cost-effective designs while supporting environmental sustainability.\n\nIf you have questions about how these changes might affect your projects, please reach out to us. We\u2019re here to help you navigate the evolving landscape of refrigerant requirements."

            "article_content": "You've almost certainly put lettuce on a burger, but what if a type of seaweed called sea lettuce was the burger.\n\nResearchers at the Chalmers University of Technology have high hopes for just that after unveiling a method to extract three times more protein from sea lettuce than a conventional burger. They published their findings in the Food Chemistry journal, via Science Direct, and pointed to a number of potential uses for the flavorful seaweed, as VegNews detailed.\n\nThe overall problem the researchers were looking to address was creating alternatives to land-based protein sources, whether that be meat, dairy, or plant-based. Seaweed provides a promising solution. It can grow well in a variety of conditions without fertilizers, watering, or insecticides.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Humanity will need to find and combine the intake of many more diversified protein sources than we have available in our diet today to meet sustainability and nutritional requirements,\" said Ingrid Undeland, a professor of food science at Chalmers, in a news release.\n\nThe research team said that its new method of extracting protein makes it more affordable and comparable to the process for pea and soy proteins. Sea lettuce is also rich in vitamin B12 and omega-3 fatty acids. As far as the taste, the scientists were bullish that there were tons of applications for it.\n\n\"It tastes like umami with a certain salty flavor, despite not containing such high levels of salt,\" said researcher Jo\u00e3o Trigo of a concentrate of the sea lettuce proteins. Trigo said the powder would be a \"great flavor enhancer for seafood dishes and products\" but dreamed bigger down the road.\n\n\"Why not protein smoothies or 'blue burgers' from the sea?\" Trigo asked.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf that were to come to fruition, it would provide another alternative to animal-based protein sources. That could be important for the health of humans and the health of the planet, as research has clearly shown the benefits of plant-based diets.\n\nOn the human health side, a recent study said reducing red-meat consumption by 30% could save over 45,000 lives in a 10-year span. Those sorts of health benefits were also seen in a study featuring identical twins when the twins on the vegan diet saw major improvements in key health metrics.\n\nWhy do you eat plant-based foods?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nAs far as the planet's health, another study revealed switching away from red meat and dairy-based diets to plant-based ones could reduce greenhouse gases by 17%. The Guardian also explored a study that showed how much climate damage and resource usage could be cut down with plant-based diets.\n\nThe Chalmers University team said it is also working to boost the protein content in the seaweed by growing it in processed water used by the seafood industry. It also hopes to use the nonprotein parts of the sea lettuce for food, medical, and material applications.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, when it comes to food sources, Undeland noted that \"sea-based possibilities\" or \"blue proteins\" have so far been \"overlooked.\"\n\n\"Algae is a good addition to many of the products already on the market,\" Undeland concluded.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

Javon Marks, a popular crypto analyst, tweeted that BNB could be on the verge of a significant surge, potentially tripling its current value to the $2,000 level.\n\nMarks underlined that historical trends of BNB point to a possible bullish push, thereby maybe guiding the token to a new all-time high (ATH).\n\nBNB Shows Signs of Recovery Amid Bullish Momentum\n\nMeanwhile, BNB is swapped hands at about $689.58 at the time of writing, a 3.46% increase over the last 24 hours. Following the token\u2019s multi-day correction, which let market analysts conjecture on its next movement, this increasing momentum results. The present price recovery points to a starting point of a bullish sentiment.\n\n[mcrypto id=\u201d435407\u2033]\n\nApart from market trends, the BNB ecosystem gains from important developments and cooperative efforts as well. Leading DeFi platform PancakeSwap on BNB Chain has unveiled SpringBoard, a no-code tool meant to streamline token production and usage on the chain, as we previously reported.\n\nThis innovative ability instantly provides liquidity for recently introduced tokens, therefore removing the need for coding knowledge. The project is supposed to greatly improve user accessibility and propel further BNB Chain ecosystem adoption.\n\nFurthermore, showing increasing interest in BNB is the traditional financial industry. A few days ago, according to CNF, Osprey Funds debuted the first publicly traded fund in the United States based on Binance Coin, hence further combining blockchain technologies with traditional financial processes.\n\nOffering regulated access to the BNB ecosystem, the Osprey BNB Chain Trust lets traditional investors participate in the growing DeFi sector."

            "article_content": "Researchers from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Jackson State University have explored the severity of police-involved traffic collisions by harnessing advanced machine learning techniques. Analyzing data from 1,022 police-related accidents in Mississippi between 2010 and 2018, the study uncovers critical factors influencing collision outcomes. Using machine learning models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, the researchers pinpointed key variables and developed actionable recommendations for improving traffic safety and mitigating the risks faced by law enforcement officers during such incidents.\n\nThe Role of Seatbelt Usage in Reducing Collision Severity\n\nThe study identified seatbelt usage as one of the most significant factors influencing the severity of police-involved collisions. Data showed that the absence of seatbelt use substantially increased the likelihood of severe injuries or fatalities. This underscores the urgent need for stricter enforcement of seatbelt compliance among police officers. While the general public is often reminded of seatbelt regulations, this study emphasizes that officers themselves must adhere to safety measures, especially during high-risk scenarios like emergency responses. Promoting seatbelt usage could save lives and reduce the impact of severe accidents.\n\nHow Location and Weather Conditions Contribute to Risk\n\nEnvironmental and situational factors also emerged as significant contributors to collision severity. Accidents occurring on interstate highways were far more likely to result in severe outcomes compared to those on local roads. Higher vehicle speeds and the complexity of traffic patterns on highways amplify the risks. Similarly, adverse weather conditions such as rain or snow were found to significantly increase the probability of severe accidents. These findings highlight the importance of understanding and preparing for the unique risks posed by specific environments and weather patterns, particularly for officers who spend much of their time on the road.\n\nElevated Risks During Emergency Responses\n\nThe study provided critical insights into the heightened risks officers face during emergency responses. When responding to calls or emergencies, officers encounter significantly higher chances of severe collisions. Factors such as high-speed driving, heightened stress levels, and potential distractions were identified as key contributors to these outcomes. The interplay of these elements makes emergency responses one of the most hazardous situations for law enforcement personnel. This research sheds light on the occupational dangers faced by police officers and emphasizes the need for focused training and policy interventions to mitigate these risks.\n\nRecommendations for a Safer Future\n\nBased on the findings, the researchers put forth several recommendations aimed at reducing the severity of police-involved collisions. Strengthening seatbelt compliance among officers is a critical step. Agencies must ensure that officers prioritize their safety by consistently wearing seatbelts, especially in high-risk scenarios. Additionally, specialized training programs for officers should focus on high-speed driving and emergency response skills. Such training could help officers manage stress, maintain situational awareness, and minimize distractions. The study also highlights the potential of advanced vehicle safety technologies, such as collision avoidance systems and speed limiters, to enhance safety during high-speed pursuits or emergency responses. Implementing these technologies in police vehicles could significantly reduce the risks faced by officers.\n\nFurthermore, the research underscores the value of predictive, data-driven approaches in addressing traffic safety challenges. By leveraging machine learning tools, law enforcement agencies can gain deeper insights into risk factors and develop targeted strategies to prevent accidents. Predictive models could help identify high-risk locations or scenarios, enabling agencies to allocate resources more effectively. The insights gained from this study are not limited to police-involved collisions; they also offer valuable lessons for broader traffic safety initiatives. The interplay of factors such as seatbelt usage, environmental conditions, and high-speed driving is relevant to various traffic safety challenges and can guide efforts to reduce accident severity across different contexts.\n\nToward Proactive Traffic Safety Measures\n\nThis study highlights the intricate interplay of factors influencing the severity of police-involved traffic collisions and underscores the potential of machine learning in uncovering these patterns. By integrating advanced technologies, policy changes, and behavioral interventions, law enforcement agencies can take proactive steps to address the identified risks. Ensuring seatbelt compliance, providing specialized training, and adopting vehicle safety technologies are vital components of a comprehensive strategy to enhance officer and public safety. The findings from this research pave the way for meaningful action, empowering agencies to reduce the frequency and severity of collisions, safeguard officers, and improve community safety."

            "article_content": "US stocks soared Friday after tame inflation data and dovish comments from the Fed's Austan Goolsbee.\n\nGoolsbee said he expects interest rates to continue to decline over the next 12-18 months.\n\nInvestors are closely monitoring a potential government shutdown and a big triple-witching day for the options market.\n\nUS stocks surged on Friday, recovering some of the week's losses sparked by a hawkish Federal Reserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 500 points, giving back some of its intraday gains after being up over 800 points. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 were up over 1%.\n\nThe market opened lower, though it reversed course later in the morning. The gains accelerated after Fed president Austan Goolsbee told CNBC that he expects interest rates to decline \"a fair bit\" over the next 12-18 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoolsbee, along with the broader market, was encouraged by recent inflation data, which came in below economist estimates.\n\nA slide in bond yields also helped stocks through the day, with the 10-year Treasury yield down four basis points to 4.528%.\n\nThe PCE index, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, rose 0.1% month-over-month in November, compared to economist estimates of 0.2%. On an annual basis, the gauge rose 2.4% versus expectations of 2.5%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're still on path to get to 2% and at least for this new month you don't want to make too much out of any one month, but I'm hopeful that this suggests that the couple of months of firming were more of a bump than a change in path,\" Goolsbee said of the recent inflation data.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood at the 4:oo p.m. closing bell on Friday:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConcerns of an imminent government shutdown have also driven recent market volatility. Congress has until midnight on Friday to pass a deal to avert a shutdown.\n\nWhile Congress had a stopgap funding bill in place a few days ago, President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk torpedoed it, complaining about unnecessary spending measures within the bill.\n\nA second attempt to pass a government funding bill endorsed by Trump failed in the House of Representatives late Thursday evening, with a final vote of 174 for and 235 against.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has since proposed a new plan that would temporarily keep the government open and fund disaster aid. The bill reportedly has support from Republicans, and is set for a vote later on Friday.\n\nFor his part, President Trump has said that he wants to see an elimination of the debt ceiling, or at least extend a pause of the debt ceiling to 2029 when his second term ends.\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson's new bill does not include the elimination of the debt ceiling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraders are also on watch at the close amid the quarterly \"triple-witching,\" with about $6.5 trillion worth of options tied to stocks and ETFs set to expire.\n\nHere's what else happened today:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn commodities, bonds, and crypto:"

            "article_content": "Apparently believing that the more you repeat a lie the truer it becomes, President Biden recently quoted a Time article claiming that \u201cPresident Trump is receiving the strongest economy in modern history.\u201d\n\nThe Time article was little more than a setup designed to position Democrats to take credit for the inevitable Trump economic boom\u2014as I noted on these pages just four days before Biden repeated this audacious claim. Expect similar efforts from the Left as they attempt to rewrite economic history in hopes that our memories are weak enough\u2014and our gullibility strong enough\u2014to overcome economic reality.\n\nThe fact is, Biden is handing Trump an economy on the precipice of disaster. Thanks in large part to Biden\u2019s four-year deficit spending spree, the economy is shackled by an incomprehensibly huge $36 trillion in debt and $1 trillion less in Treasury cash on hand. That debt is growing exponentially, with interest alone now consuming over $1.1 trillion annually.\n\nPresident Biden speaks about the future of the American economy at the Brookings Institution in Washington, Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2024. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nAnd while Biden has been touting jobs numbers, those estimates keep getting revised down after wildly overoptimistic initial reports. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia just estimated that net job growth in the second quarter of this year was likely negative, meaning employment was falling.\n\n>>> Why Are Americans Still Feeling the Economic Squeeze?\n\nAdd in inflation that is once again accelerating by every measure, and you have some understanding of the debt-ridden, inflationary, dumpster-fire economy Trump is actually inheriting.\n\nSo, what is Biden talking about?\n\nOf course, much of Biden\u2019s speech was laced with false and misleading data woven into generalities about Bidenomics \u201cgrowing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up\u201d (which means absolutely nothing) and the evils of \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d (which exists only in the minds of the economically illiterate). Biden actually blamed nonexistent trickle-down economics for creating \u201cbigger deficits.\u201d I guess he had to blame something.\n\nBut, seriously, bigger than what?\n\nThere has never been a bigger federal deficit than the one Biden is handing off\u2014other than in times of severe national crises. But we are not facing a severe national crisis. The pandemic is long over and we are not at war. Nonetheless, the federal debt is 121% of our gross national product\u2014the level at which it peaked during World War II!\n\nFor a more recent comparison, our annual federal deficit was just under $1 trillion in 2019 heading into the pandemic. In 2022, following the pandemic, it was about $1.4 trillion. For the most recent fiscal year (ending Sept. 30), Biden\u2019s runaway-train spending deficit hit a stunning $1.8 trillion, an 80% increase from pre-pandemic levels. Now that\u2019s big.\n\nFor some perspective, at over $1.1 trillion annually, interest alone on our federal debt now exceeds our entire pre-pandemic annual federal deficit.\n\nWhy? A feedback loop of excessive government spending. First, Biden\u2019s reckless spending regime set off inflation (as even the Democrats\u2019 economist emeritus Larry Summers warned it would). That inflation then induced the Fed to raise interest rates. Now Biden has the economy in a death spiral of higher debt levels and higher interest rates driving each other\u2014and his deficit spending spree continues.\n\nHow quickly are things spiraling out of control? Very quickly!\n\nIn October and November 2023, the federal deficit was $380 billion. For the same months this year, it's already $624 billion, a shocking 64% increase over last year with no plan in place to constrain it. None.\n\nThis is the actual economy \u201cTrump is receiving.\u201d Rather than the \u201cstrongest economy in modern history,\u201d it\u2019s a house of cards built on federal debt, creating what is one of\u2014if not the\u2014most dangerous economies in modern history.\n\nSo, what is Biden\u2019s proposed solution? Piling the ridiculous atop the absurd, Biden stated that it is his \u201cprofound hope that the new administration will preserve and build on [his] progress.\u201d He actually said this.\n\nWhy? Well, according to Biden, things are getting better as inflation has declined \u201cto pre-pandemic levels\u201d while \u201cwages have increased.\u201d Of course, as most Americans know, neither statement is true.\n\n>>> National Debt Is a Burden on Every American\n\nIn Trump\u2019s first term, the average year-over-year inflation rate was 1.9%. When Biden took office in January 2021, annual inflation was 1.4%. Following its June 2021 peak at 9%, the inflation rate under Biden never declined to the Fed\u2019s 2% target\u2014let alone \u201cpre-pandemic levels\u201d\u2014and is currently increasing by literally every measure, with inflation around 3% or higher becoming the new normal.\n\nAs for wages going up, keep in mind that inflation is a tax. So, while the average American\u2019s weekly paycheck was a record high $1,221.42 in November, that paycheck could purchase $176.86 less than nominally smaller average paychecks when Biden took office. This is because real weekly wages (the number on your paycheck minus inflation) are down 3% since Biden took the economic reins. That is not what most people consider an increase.\n\nReal wages were up 6.8% under Trump. Now that was an increase.\n\nSo, with crocodile tears, Biden bemoans the possibility that we could \u201cbackslide to an economy that benefited those at the top, while working people and the middle-class struggle\u201d to get \u201ca fair share of growth.\u201d Does anyone honestly believe that inflation-strapped working- and middle-class Americans are getting a fair share under Bidenomics? The people benefiting in today\u2019s economy are those who own stocks, interest-bearing securities or real estate. In other words, \u201cthose at the top.\u201d That is what Bidenomics produced.\n\nAs a reminder for the outgoing president, in 2019 under Trump, the unemployment rate declined to historic lows for every race and both sexes, family incomes hit historic highs, the poverty rate hit an historic low, and income inequality declined\u2014all with inflation below 2%.\n\nHonestly, the misery of \u201cthe strongest economy in modern history\u201d cannot end soon enough."

            "article_content": "\n\nAs Valve appears to be ready to bring back third-party Steam machines, the next edition of CES could be quite interesting for PC gaming handheld enthusiasts. Indeed, Lenovo may be one of the first manufacturers to launch a new model running Valve\u2019s SteamOS instead of Windows 11.\n\nLast week, Evan Blass leaked some pictures of what could be the Legion Go S, an upcoming gaming handheld from Lenovo. Some of these pictures showed what looks like a Steam button on the left side of the screen, suggesting that the device could run SteamOS instead of Windows 11. However, another picture showing the same device in white had a different logo near that same button, so maybe a Windows version is in the cards as well.\n\nAnyway, Lenovo seems to have confirmed that something related to Valve and gaming handhelds will happen at CES: Yesterday, the company sent email invites to journalists for a CES event where it\u2019s planning to discuss \u201cwhat lies ahead in the gaming handheld space and showcasing our latest Lenovo Legion Go innovations advanced by AMD.\u201d As reported by The Verge, the invite mentioned the presence of Valve\u2019s \u201cChief Design Architect\u201d Pierre-Loup Griffais.\n\nWindows Intelligence In Your Inbox Sign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday \u2014 and get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field Guides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift! \"*\" indicates required fields Email * Name This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. \u0394\n\nLenovo\u2019s CES event will also feature Jason Ronald, Microsoft VP of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem who also has a new \u201cVP of Next Generation\u201d title. Microsoft is very much interested in gaming handhelds, and the company is still working hard to optimize its Xbox app for PC for smaller screens. Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming also recently confirmed that the company was working on gaming handheld prototypes. However, the exec added that the first Xbox handheld was still a few years out.\n\nWhile both Xbox and PlayStation are working on their own gaming handhelds, Valve has a real shot a growing the SteamOS ecosystem with the help of PC manufacturers. The company also told The Verge earlier this year that it was working to support SteamOS on the Asus ROG Ally, another popular Windows-based gaming handheld."

After fully embracing the potential of public cloud services, many companies are reevaluating their strategies and shifting workloads back to on-premises infrastructures.\n\nThis trend, known as cloud repatriation, is driven by rising costs and increasing complexities in public cloud environments. More and more repatriation projects are underway as enterprises continue to receive exorbitant cloud bills. Many enterprises now realize that the unexpectedly high costs of cloud services are unsustainable in the long term.\n\nGEICO has made headlines for its decision to repatriate numerous workloads back to on-premises solutions. In a recent interview, Rebecca Weekly, the vice president of platform and infrastructure engineering, said the initial goal of moving to the cloud was to reduce costs and complexity, but it ultimately had the opposite effect."

            "article_content": "From a Mediterranean shipwreck to a mosaic on display in Washington, DC, these are the discoveries that made scholars of the biblical world say \u201cwow\u201d this year.\n\nEmil Aladjem/Israel Antiquities Authority via AP\n\nThe continued fighting in Israel limited biblical archaeology this year. But a few excavations made it into the field in 2024, and some of their discoveries are remarkable. Israel also sent some of its most treasured discoveries aboard\u2014a boon for many in the US who would like to see them.\n\nWhile the most important discoveries of this past year will not be known for years to come, these are the top stories about archaeological developments related to the land of the Bible, the biblical period, and the early history of Christianity that caught our attention in 2024.\n\n10. A new center in Jerusalem\n\nThe Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) opened its new center in Jerusalem after 14 years of construction. The Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel hasn\u2019t had a grand opening yet\u2014that may still be a year or two away. But the $106 million structure just down the hill from the Israel Museum began inviting the public to see the new archaeological discoveries.\n\nSign up for The Daily Briefing Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nArchitect and urban planner Moshe Safdie designed the building to resemble an excavation site. The entrance is covered by a canopy resembling those found at excavations all over Israel. As visitors descend, they see galleries, laboratories, films, and exhibits that display a small portion of the archaeological richness of the Holy Land.\n\n9. The Siege of Jerusalem\n\nThe Assyrian king Sennacherib \u201ccame down\u201d on Jerusalem in 701 BC \u201clike the wolf on the fold,\u201d with his armies \u201cgleaming in purple and gold,\u201d as famously described by the poet Byron. The king, for his part, ordered an inscription memorializing the feat, saying how he\u2019d shut up Hezekiah \u201clike a caged bird in his royal city.\u201d Sennacherib conveniently omitted the fact that he failed to actually take Jerusalem.\n\nThe site of that siege has been identified by archaeologist Stephen Compton using modern mapping techniques.\n\nCompton took a depiction of Sennacherib\u2019s camp from detailed relief panels excavated from Sennacherib\u2019s palace in Ninevah back in 1840, which are now on display at the British Museum. He superimposed that picture on aerial photos of a siege camp at Lachish, Judah\u2019s second largest city, which was conquered in 701 BC.\n\nCompton then looked around Jerusalem and found a similar layout at Ammunition Hill, now remembered as the site of fierce fighting in Israel\u2019s 1967 Six-Day War. It\u2019s a mile and a half north of Jerusalem\u2019s Damascus Gate. Perhaps someday an excavation will search for siege evidence from 701 BC.\n\nAlthough Jerusalem was not conquered by Sennacherib, the Assyrians exacted heavy tribute. Archaeologists also reported the excavation of an administrative center, near the new US Embassy in southern Jerusalem, that may have been used by the Assyrians to collect tribute. Researchers believe it was built on top of an older administrative center, built by King Hezekiah or his father Ahaz and razed by the invaders to demonstrate their authority. Excavation uncovered an array of personalized, stamped handles from storage jars.\n\n8. Skills of the ancient mariners\n\nThe IAA announced the discovery of the deepest and earliest shipwreck ever found in the Eastern Mediterranean. Previously, historians knew of only two Bronze Age shipwrecks in the region, both near the coast of Turkey. This discovery, 56 miles offshore, suggests ancient mariners were venturing far from shore, which would only be possible with well-developed celestial navigation skills.\n\n\u201cThis is a world-class, history-changing discovery,\u201d said Jacob Sharvit, head of the IAA\u2019s marine unit. \u201cThis reveals the ancient mariners\u2019 navigation skills\u2014capable of traversing the Mediterranean Sea without a line of sight to any coast.\u201d\n\nA natural gas company was surveying the sea floor with a submersible robot and came upon a huge pile of jugs a mile below the surface. A few of the jugs were raised to the surface and identified as Late Bronze Age Canaanite storage vessels from the 14th\u201313th century BC. The Canaanites later became known as seafaring Phoenicians and developed a trading network that ranged across the Mediterranean Sea during the Iron Age.\n\n7. A libation token\n\nClay seal impressions with images and letters on one flat side and perhaps the impression on the other are common in biblical archaeology. It\u2019s quite rare to find a blob of ancient clay that is pinched on one side with writing and an image on the reverse, but that\u2019s what a team at the Temple Mount Sifting Project found.\n\nThe discovery, made in 2011, was identified in 2024 as a pilgrim\u2019s token, which could be exchanged for an offering at the temple. The wine jar depicted on the token may indicate it was payment for wine to be poured out on the temple altar. The use of such tokens is described in the Mishna, the oral Jewish law compiled in the second century.\n\n6. Canaanite complex conundrums\n\nSome of the excavations that took place in 2024 explored Canaanite cult complexes dating to the Early Bronze Age, 1,000 years before Abraham, and to the Late Bronze Age, around the time of the Exodus.\n\nSalvage archaeologists preparing the way for urban expansion excavated a site near Beit Shemesh this year and found a building that had been used for ritual activity before being suddenly abandoned. Tiny cultic vessels, which probably had a symbolic purpose, were still intact.\n\nFew similar public buildings from the period have been found in Israel, and this site is helping archaeologists develop their understanding of early urbanization.\n\nAbout six miles south, another Canaanite cult complex has been uncovered at Tel Azekah. Archaeologists say it began as an open-air sanctuary with a spectacular view and was later enclosed. It was dubbed \u201cthe Temple of the Rising Sun.\u201d\n\nTen miles further south, the 14th season of excavation at Tel Burna ended after just three weeks because of the war, with some significant mysteries still unsolved. Archaeologists believe they discovered the part of the cultic complex where the priests lived, but they still don\u2019t know why the religious site appears to have strong cultural connections with Cyprus, which is located 300 miles away in the Mediterranean. And they don\u2019t know why such a large site\u2014perhaps the largest Canaanite cult complex of the Late Bronze Age\u2014was located so far from the coastal trade routes.\n\n\u201cHow did these hillbilly Canaanites build this cult complex?\u201d said Lipscomb University archaeologist Steven Ortiz, who joined the project in 2018, in an interview with CT.\n\nOngoing research at a mysterious mud-brick arch atop Tel Shimron in northern Israel uncovered a great quantity of Canaanite cultic objects. Next to the arch, in a depression that\u2019s called a favissa\u2014a place where sacrificial objects are discarded\u2014researchers found two bronze bull figurines, which are typically connected to the worship of El, the head of the Canaanite pantheon, or the storm god Baal. They also found 40,000 animal bones and 57,000 pottery shards, including remnants of a rare Minoan jug from Crete.\n\n\u201cIn terms of religion, we don\u2019t have anything like this,\u201d archaeologist Daniel Master said. \u201cThis is on a scale that we don\u2019t have anywhere else in this region.\u201d\n\n5. The gate of Shiloh\n\nWhen the Israelites lost the ark of the covenant to the Philistines, the priest Eli fell off his chair and broke his neck at the gate of Shiloh (1 Sam. 4:18). In 2024, the excavation by the Associates for Biblical Research at Tel Shiloh finished uncovering that gate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a niche in the fortification wall. We put a beam into that niche, and it goes right across the top of the pillars,\u201d excavation director Scott Stripling told Christianity Today.\n\nNear the pillars, archaeologists also found geometric paving stones forming a plaza, which is unexpected for that time.\n\nIn another area of the tel, or mound, excavators are uncovering the walls of a building the size of the biblical tabernacle, where the ark of the covenant was kept. They have also discovered a favissa with bones from sacrifices, pottery, and gold objects, which were apparently pendants.\n\n4. Redating a Jerusalem wall\n\nA wall once attributed to King Hezekiah is now thought to have been built earlier by King Uzziah. This indicates that Jerusalem was expanding even before a flood of refugees arrived after the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel in 732 BC.\n\nWhile that reassessment adds valuable insight into the history of the city, it\u2019s also a powerful example of what can be done with a creative combination of complementary technology to establish \u201cabsolute chronology.\u201d\n\nRadiocarbon dating, normally a boon to archaeology, doesn\u2019t work very well for objects made during the Iron Age, due to a cosmic phenomenon known as the Hallstatt Plateau. This has limited the precise dating of archaeological discoveries in Jerusalem during its time as capital of the united Kingdom of Israel and then Judah. For a decade, archaeologists have worked to combine radiocarbon results in four different excavation areas with a precise single-year timeline derived from dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.\n\nThis has led to several redatings, including the wall now attributed to King Uzziah.\n\n3. The start of the alphabet\n\nThe earliest use of alphabetic writing has been pushed back 500 years through the discovery of four small fingers of clay in a tomb at Umm el-Marra in northern Syria. The tomb, which contained burials in gold and silver, was discovered in 2004 and carbon-dated to 2400 BC, the Early Bronze Age, when Umm el-Marra was a crossroad of trade routes between Aleppo and the Euphrates River.\n\nJohns Hopkins University archaeologist Glenn Schwartz was positive about the dating but came slowly to the conclusion that he had found actual alphabetical writing. He went public with his conclusion at November\u2019s annual meeting of the American Society of Overseas Research.\n\n\u201cPreviously, scholars thought the alphabet was invented in or around Egypt sometime after 1900 BCE,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cBut our artifacts are older and from a different area on the map, suggesting the alphabet may have an entirely different origin story than we thought.\u201d\n\nNumerous references to writing in the Old Testament seem to indicate a level of literacy that archaeology has been slow to support. But recent developments, including the discovery that topped CT\u2019s 2022 archaeology list, are providing a fuller picture of early literacy.\n\n2. Jesus recognized in Germany\n\nA silver amulet was found in an 1,800-year-old burial outside Frankfurt in 2018. In 2024, researchers were able to scan the item, virtually unrolling the thin amulet to read the Latin inscription inside, which says the amulet will \u201cprotect the man who surrenders himself to the will of the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, since before Jesus Christ every knee bows: those in heaven, those on earth and those under the earth, and every tongue confesses.\u201d\n\nThis discovery, announced in December, provides the earliest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps, indicating that Christianity spread to Northern Europe more quickly than had been thought. The person who wore it was buried between the year 230 and 270 AD.\n\n1. A mosaic free from prison\n\nThe Megiddo Mosaic was discovered 20 years ago, but the amazing artifact, built for a small group of Christians who worshiped together about 200 years after the time of Jesus, was inaccessible behind prison walls. In 2024, it was loaned to the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC, and is now widely available for public viewing.\n\nThe mosaic floor includes three well-preserved inscriptions, and one, in Greek, mentions \u201cGod Jesus Christ,\u201d clearly testifying to the recognition of Jesus as more than a good teacher. The design shows the space was intentionally built for Christian worship. Centered on a Communion table, it more closely resembles a Jewish synagogue than the Roman basilica, and depicts two fish, the most popular Christian imagery before Constantine.\n\nThis is only the third church building that archaeologists have discovered that dates to the time before Constantine made Christianity legal in the Roman Empire. There is one at Dura-Europus in Syria and another at the location traditionally believed to be the apostle Peter\u2019s house in Capernaum. Those were both houses converted for worship.\n\nThis mosaic floor was not discovered at Tel Megiddo, a famous archaeological site, but a few miles down the road during the renovation of a prison. The mosaic will be on display at the Museum of the Bible until July. It will eventually return to Israel.\n\nThis is an unusually good time to see biblical archaeology in US museums. In addition to the Megiddo Mosaic, the IAA has a permanent display at the Museum of the Bible called People of the Land, and the IAA also has a traveling exhibit on the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is currently at the Reagan library in California.\n\nThe Tel Dan Stele, which includes the first known reference to the house of David, is on display at the Jewish Museum in New York City through January 5. And Discovering the World of Jesus, which includes the controversial James Ossuary with the inscription \u201cJames, the son of Joseph, the brother of Jesus,\u201d is on display in Atlanta.\n\nGordon Govier writes about biblical archaeology for Christianity Today, hosts the archaeology radio program The Book and The Spade, and is the editor of Artifax."

Here's how experts say you can and should, report UFO or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) in Canada.\n\nTransport Canada collects aviation occurrence information and enters it into the Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Reporting System, known as CADORS.\n\nIn CADORS reports, Transport Canada said the term \u201cUFO\u201d can include sightings of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs or drones), balloons, meteors, weather phenomena and birds.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\u201cIt should not be interpreted to mean something of extraterrestrial origin. The information in CADORS should be treated as preliminary, unsubstantiated and subject to change,\u201d said Flavio Nienow, Transport Canada spokesperson, in a statement.\n\nTransport Canada said they don't have any additional information to provide beyond what can be found in CADORS.\n\nHow does Transport Canada followup on reports?\n\nWhen reports like these are generated, Nienow explained the next steps depend on the type of the incident reported.\n\n\u201cFurther follow up may be undertaken by various organizations including Transport Canada, Nav Canada, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada and the North American Aerospace Defense Command,\u201d he said. \u201cTransport Canada will use every tool at its disposal in an attempt to find an aircraft found to be operating in an unsafe and unlawful manner.\u201d\n\nNienow said anyone who witnesses unsafe aviation activity should contact Transport Canada or local law enforcement. Witnesses are encouraged to record and provide as much information as possible to help Transport Canada review incidents more effectively. For example, send clear photos or videos, record the date, time and any other identifying marks.\n\nOther aviation incidents may be reported at Incident reporting: Report an aviation incident. Drone-related incidents can also be reported.\n\nHow else can you report?\n\nThe U.S.-based National UFO Reporting Center collects all sorts of reports \u2014 including UFO and UAP reports from Canada, the U.S., and around the world. They encourage people to use their website to report occurrences.\n\nThroughout its history, the organization has processed more than 180,000 reports.\n\n\u201cWe look at every single report. We make an assessment,\u201d said Christian Stepien, the organization's chief technology officer, and follow up on reports that require a more in-depth look.\n\nReports are placed in the organization's databank, where you can review past reports categorized by date and location.\n\nThis publication reached out to the Ontario Provincial Police about UFO or UAP reports and asked how they advise citizens both generally and specifically to report them. We have not yet received a response."

            "article_content": "The relationship with our babies can often be seen as a dance\u2014a give-and-take of eye contact, touch, gestures, and emotions between parent and child. This metaphorical dance finds its scientific grounding in the concept of biobehavioral synchrony. Defined as the dynamic and reciprocal adaptation of behaviors and biology between two people, synchrony plays a foundational role in a child\u2019s development. It shapes emotional, cognitive, and social outcomes, setting the stage for healthy development.\n\nBut what does this mean for one of the most challenging aspects of parenting: infant sleep?\n\nMy intention in this month\u2019s blog post is to explore the findings from Lecl\u00e8re et al.'s review (1) on synchrony and connect them to the art of nurturing infant sleep, offering insights for parents and professionals alike.\n\nBiobehavioral Synchrony: A Foundation for Development\n\nLecl\u00e8re et al.\u2019s review spans decades of research, analyzing studies that illuminate how mother-child synchrony influences developmental trajectories. Synchrony is not just about physical proximity or shared time; it\u2019s a dynamic, moment-to-moment alignment of emotions, gestures, and rhythms. Whether it\u2019s a shared gaze, vocalizations, or synchronized gestures, these micro-interactions lay the groundwork for critical developmental processes.\n\nFor example, Ruth Feldman\u2019s longitudinal studies, highlighted in the review, demonstrate that early synchrony predicts long-term outcomes like empathy, school readiness, and emotional regulation. Similarly, the well-known \u201cstill-face\u201d paradigm by Cohn and Tronick shows how even brief disruptions in synchrony can distress infants, underscoring its role in fostering emotional security.\n\nThe implications are profound: synchrony is not merely a passive byproduct of healthy interactions but an active process that molds a child\u2019s brain and behavior. This insight becomes especially relevant when considering infant sleep, an area where synchrony\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014 plays a central role.\n\nThe Role of Synchrony in Infant Sleep\n\nInfant sleep is not just a biological necessity; it\u2019s also a social process deeply intertwined with emotional regulation and attachment. The findings from Lecl\u00e8re et al.\u2019s review highlight several ways that synchrony may influence sleep:\n\n1. Nervous System Regulation\n\nSynchrony serves as a co-regulatory mechanism for infants, providing the external support needed to settle into sleep. Through attuned interactions, caregivers help align an infant\u2019s physiological rhythms to states conducive to rest. For example, a parent\u2019s gentle rocking or soothing voice can create a calming effect, guiding the infant toward relaxation and eventual sleep.\n\nResearch on oxytocin underscores this connection. Oxytocin, often called the \u201clove hormone,\u201d plays a fundamental role in biobehavioral synchrony. Elevated oxytocin levels during synchronized mother-infant interactions have been linked to enhanced emotional regulation in infants, which is critical for making the transition from wakefulness to sleep smoother and less stressful.\n\n2. Stress Reduction\n\nInfants are highly sensitive to disruptions in synchrony, as shown in the \u201cstill-face\u201d paradigm. These disruptions can increase cortisol levels, a stress hormone that interferes with sleep. By maintaining synchrony, caregivers can buffer against stress, creating a calm and secure environment that promotes restorative sleep.\n\n3. Attachment Security\n\nAttachment theory emphasizes the importance of secure attachment, and synchrony is a vital ingredient in its formation. Attachment can be understood as the balance between two fundamental needs: the secure base from which to explore and the safe haven to return to in times of distress. For infants, falling asleep alone often activates the attachment system, triggering a need for reassurance and safety. When caregivers fulfill their \u201csafe haven\u201d role\u2014through physical presence, soothing interactions, or attuned responses\u2014they provide infants with a \u201cfelt sense\u201d of safety in their bodies. This sense of safety enables infants to relax and transition into sleep, confident that they are protected and cared for.\n\n4. Routine and Predictability\n\nSynchrony naturally incorporates elements of routine, as caregivers intuitively adapt to their infant\u2019s needs and cues. Predictable, synchronized interactions during bedtime can signal to the infant that it\u2019s time to sleep. This alignment between caregiver actions and infant expectations fosters a smoother transition to sleep.\n\nPractical Strategies for Nurturing Infant Sleep through Synchrony\n\nThe science of biobehavioral synchrony provides valuable insights for supporting infant sleep. Here are some practical strategies:\n\n1. Follow the Infant\u2019s Cues\n\nInfants communicate their needs through subtle cues, such as eye contact, vocalizations, and body movements. By responding promptly and appropriately, caregivers can establish synchrony, fostering a sense of safety that promotes sleep.\n\n2. Create a Synchronized Bedtime Routine\n\nA bedtime routine aligned with the infant\u2019s natural rhythms helps signal that it\u2019s time to wind down. Activities like bathing, singing lullabies, massage, rocking, or feeding can be synchronized with the infant\u2019s cues to create a calming sleep environment.\n\n3. Use Gentle Touch and Movement\n\nRocking, swaying, or rhythmic patting can synchronize with an infant\u2019s physiological rhythms, promoting relaxation. Skin-to-skin contact or gentle massages also enhance oxytocin release, further supporting sleep.\n\n4. Maintain Emotional Availability\n\nA caregiver\u2019s emotional state profoundly impacts synchrony. Staying regulated and present during bedtime routines provides the co-regulation infants need to settle into sleep. Emotional availability allows the caregiver to respond attuned to the infant\u2019s cues, fostering calm and security. Practicing daily nervous system regulation\u2014such as mindfulness, deep breathing, or brief moments of self-care\u2014can strengthen the caregiver\u2019s capacity to remain grounded, which in turn helps co-regulate the infant more effectively.\n\n5. Address Sleep Disruptors\n\nRecognizing and mitigating sleep disruptors\u2014for both the infant and the parent\u2014can help sustain synchrony. Environmental factors like noise, room temperature, and light exposure can be adjusted to create an optimal sleep environment. Equally important is adult sleep hygiene. Small changes, such as maintaining a consistent time to go to bed, incorporating calming pre-sleep rituals, and avoiding phone scrolling at night can make a significant difference in the adult\u2019s capacity for synchrony and consequently protect infant sleep needs.\n\nSynchrony as the Heartbeat of Nurturing Sleep\n\nSynchrony can be seen as the heartbeat of nurturing infant sleep interactions. By fostering synchrony through attuned interactions, caregivers can create a nurturing environment that supports both the immediate goal of restful sleep and the long-term goal of healthy development.\n\nFor parents and professionals, understanding the science of biobehavioral synchrony offers a powerful framework for addressing sleep challenges. In the dance of caregiving, synchrony is the rhythm that guides each step, ensuring that both parent and child move together toward rest, connection, and growth."

            "article_content": "At 48, Noam Shazeer stands as an iconic figure in the world of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nKnown as a brilliant yet defiant trailblazer, Shazeer\u2019s journey through the tech landscape is nothing short of dramatic.\n\nHe lives in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, arguably the beating heart of the global tech revolution.\n\nCoder\n\nHis coding brilliance has often placed him at the frontier of technological innovation \u2014 and rebellion.\n\nShazeer took up Computer Science and Mathematics at Duke. This rigorous combination laid the foundation for his deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, and mathematical modeling.\n\nIn the early 2000s, after completing his degree, Shazeer joined Google, ready to leave his mark on the nascent tech giant.\n\nDad of spelling corrector\n\nOne of his earliest triumphs?\n\nElevating Google\u2019s \"spelling corrector\" to unprecedented accuracy. It was a quiet, but profound, revolution for the search engine millions would come to rely on. It turns out spelling snafus could be solved by mathematics, thanks to geniuses like Shazeer.\n\nShazeer\u2019s brilliance thrived on boldness. He had invented much of the current revolution in large language models (LLMs).\n\nSome of his inventions include:\n\nSparsely-gated mixture of experts (2016): It utilises a number of \"experts\", each a simple feed-forward neural network, and a trainable gating network which selects a sparse combination of the experts to process each input (\n\nTransformer (2017): He personally designed the multi-head attention, the residual architecture, and coded up the first better-than-state-of-the-art working implementation.\n\nMesh-Tensorflow (2018): The first practical system for training giant Transformers on supercomputers.\n\nT5 (2019): Major contributor to Google\u2019s LaMDA dialog system (a project led by Daniel De Freitas, Shazeer\u2019s co-founder at Character AI).\n\nFast-forward\n\nFast forward two decades to 2021.\n\nShazeer walked away from Google, with Daniel De Freitas, a skilled AI researcher. This tandem with De Freitas was united by a shared vision \u2014 and frustration.\n\nShazeer was raised in a household with a strong academic background: His dad, a multilingual math-teacher-turned engineer, and his mother, a dedicated homemaker, who fostered an environment that valued education and curiosity.\n\nDe Freitas, for his part, spent his early years traveling with his mother. They lived in various countries including Venezuela and the UK and eventually settled in Florida with his adoptive father. His multicultural upbringing exposed De Freitas to diverse cultures and languages, giving him a strong background in natural language processing (NLP).\n\nNLP involves teaching computers to understand and generate human-like text.\n\nWhile working at Google, De Freitas and Shazeer developed \"Meena\", an advanced chatbot praised for its conversational capabilities.\n\nBloomberg reported in August that Character.AI co-founders Noam Shazeer (right) and Daniel De Freitas were \u201chired\u201d by Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent firm), along with some members of its research team, in a \u201clicensing deal\u201d. Image Credit: Character AI\n\nTogether, they had developed Meena, an advanced AI chatbot destined to reshape conversational AI. Yet, Google hesitated, shelving the project. The reason was unclear.\n\nDisillusioned, the pair left to chart their own course, founding Character.AI, a platform that would become synonymous with cutting-edge generative AI.\n\nWhy did he leave Google?\n\n\u201cI have always been excited about AI,\" Shazeer said in an interview on a16z.com. \"I just wanted to move, push technology forward.\u201d\n\nLarge Language Models Large Language Models (LLMs) are computer programs that can understand and generate text, much like a human.\n\n\n\nThey work by studying huge amounts of text from the internet, books, and other sources, learning patterns, meanings, and how words fit together.\n\n\n\nSo, when you ask them a question or give them a task (like writing an email), they use what they've learned to predict and create a response that makes sense.\n\n\n\nThink of them as super-smart text predictors that can chat, write, and answer questions!\n\nCharacter.AI\n\nAfter Character.ai was launched, it soared, raising over $150 million in funding. But the story didn\u2019t end there.\n\nCharacter.ai is new kind of conversational AI. Unlike typical chatbots, Character.ai enables users to interact with AI personas that simulate human conversation on a deep level. Users can engage with historical figures, fictional characters, or entirely customised personas.\n\nSome kids (including my 11-year-old son Toffee) describe it as the \"app for weirdos\".\n\nCharacter.AI has faced criticism.\n\nFor one, the app allows users to create and interact with AI personas, including fictional characters, celebrities, and historical figures. It's a deliberate choice on the part of its creators, with niche use-cases, unconventional user behaviour, and a unique way of engaging users with AI-generated personalities.\n\nMany users engage in role-playing or fantasy-based conversations, which can range from innocent fun to deeply personal or unconventional scenarios.\n\nCases against Character.ai The AI chatbot platform has faced serious allegations linking its services to user self-harm and suicide. Notably:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Florida Lawsuit (October 2024): Megan Garcia filed a lawsuit against Character.AI and Google, alleging that the platform contributed to her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III's suicide. The lawsuit claims that Sewell developed an emotional relationship with a chatbot impersonating Daenerys Targaryen from \"Game of Thrones,\" which led to his tragic death.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Texas Lawsuit (December 2024): Two families in Texas sued Character.AI, alleging that the platform encouraged self-harm and provided inappropriate content to their children. One case involved a 17-year-old who began self-harming after a chatbot introduced the topic, while another involved exposure to inappropriate content, New York Post reported.\n\n\n\nIn response to these incidents, Character.AI has implemented new safety measures, including separate language models for adult and teenage users, stricter content restrictions, and parental controls to monitor usage.\n\nYet the high level of customisation that Character.AI brings to the realm of chatbots cannot be denied. Moreover, the imaginative interaction appeals to niche communities, though it may seem eccentric or \u201cweird\u201d to outsiders.\n\nThe platform's other key strength: natural-language understanding and adaptability, thus creating immersive and life-like interactions.\n\n$ 2.7 b amount reportedly paid by Google to take back Noam Shazeer\n\nNow, in a twist worthy of a Hollywood script, reports surfaced in August 2024 that Shazeer and DeFreitas were returning to their roots \u2014 Google.\n\nThe tech giant, perhaps eager to reclaim its prodigal sons, reportedly paid a staggering $2.7 million to bring Shazeer back into the fold.\n\nCHARACTER.AI FEATURES One of Character.ai\u2019s standout features is its customisation. Users can craft their own unique AI characters by setting their personalities, backstories, and responses.\n\n\n\nThis flexibility has attracted creators, educators, and enthusiasts who enjoy building characters tailored to specific needs, whether for entertainment, role-playing, or learning.\n\n\n\nDiverse Use Cases\n\nCharacter.ai is not just for casual conversation\u2014it caters to diverse applications. Students use it to \"talk\" with historical figures for educational purposes.\n\n\n\nWriters use it as a tool for brainstorming ideas with fictional characters, and fans use it to interact with avatars of their favorite icons. It\u2019s a fusion of learning, creativity, and entertainment.\n\n\n\nCharacter.ai is built with privacy in mind, as interactions on the platform are not stored for long-term use, prioritizing user trust. It\u2019s also designed to be intuitive, requiring no technical skills to create or interact with characters, making it accessible for both casual users and professionals.\n\n\u201cI am super excited to return to Google and work as part of the Google DeepMind team,\u201d Shazeer told TechCrunch. \u201cSo proud of everything we\u2019ve built at Character.AI over the last three years.\u201d\n\nDeepMind\n\nGoogle, too, made no attempt to hide its enthusiasm. In a statement dripping with admiration, the company said: \"We\u2019re particularly thrilled to welcome back Noam, a preeminent researcher in machine learning, who is joining Google\u2019s DeepMind research team, along with a small number of his colleagues.\"\n\nDeFreitas, equally integral to this saga, is also set to rejoin the search titan, solidifying their return as a monumental homecoming for Google.\n\nSpecific figures for Daniel De Freitas's return have not been publicly disclosed. Since both played key roles in the creation of Character.AI and are valuable AI researchers, it is likely that De Freitas's compensation was similarly significant, though details remain speculative.\n\nHigh-stake AI\n\nAs part of the agreement, Character.AI will reportedly benefit from increased funding, ensuring that the legacy of their groundbreaking work lives on.\n\nFrom maverick departures to celebrated returns, Shazeer\u2019s story (and, by extension, De Freitas's too) is a testament to the unrelenting push-and-pull of innovation in the high-stakes world of AI."
