        "article_content": "An office in the Pentagon investigated UFOs\u2014and the paranormal\u2014over a decade ago, segueing into a long saga leading to Congressional hearings and breathless news stories today. But the real story looks more like former defense officials pushing their personal mythology, rather than any cover-up of aliens\n\nAfter a long hiatus of systematic U.S. government\u2013affiliated investigations into UFOs, a Pentagon office quietly resumed such efforts in 2008. Called the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (AAWSAP), it was funded to the tune of $22 million in total. The life\u2014and cancellation four years later\u2014of this Defense Intelligence Agency program has featured in congressional hearings, UFO \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claims and renewed public uproar about aliens. But the real story is more sordid than sensational.\n\nIn 2022 the U.S. Department of Defense established the brand-new and separate All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to investigate military reports of UFOs, now called unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAP. Currently AARO offers a unique chance for the government to get this UFO thing right once and for all\u2014but not in quite the way that more hard-line alien believers might wish.\n\nThe new office has its hands full. Last year congressional hearings heard claims of alien technology recoveries and a supposed decades-long cover-up of ET\u2019s presence on Earth. Such assertions fill the new book Imminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt for UFOs, by former military counterintelligence officer Luis Elizondo, attracting renewed notice among podcasters and serious news outlets alike.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nInvestigating these unverifiable fables about aliens should be scrapped as a fool\u2019s errand for AARO, which earlier this year released a historical review demolishing this long-running conspiracy theory. The office\u2019s real value, from a technical standpoint, lies in resolving UFO sighting reports with the very latest technology and tools, supplementing time-honored fact-checking and investigation, and showing how UFOs can be tracked and resolved in real time using high-tech sensors, rather than relying on the suboptimal witness testimonials that fill bookshelves and cable-news specials.\n\nGovernment-themed conspiracy theories have been part of the UFO milieu for decades, but recent testimonies by \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d to congressional committees have given these accounts a hitherto unparalleled air of authenticity. Far from being a scientific sea change, however, as longtime scholars of UFO claims we regard them as having elements closer to religion, with the same core group of advocates\u2014including some former AAWSAP insiders\u2014pushing the \u201cnonhuman intelligence\u201d narrative of hidden aliens or interdimensional beings.\n\nAAWSAP was officially meant to research future aerospace threats but was a de facto UFO/paranormal investigation effort, a fact affirmed in the AARO historical report. Controversy has surrounded the office since the publication of a credulous 2017 New York Times article identified it by the moniker \u201cAdvanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program\u201d (AATIP). The acronym soup confusion regarding the name has been exacerbated by Elizondo, who co-opted the AATIP label for his own, informal follow-on effort at the Pentagon after AAWSAP\u2019s termination in 2012.\n\nAAWSAP\u2019s output included 38 \u201cDefense Intelligence Reference Documents\u201d produced by scientists contracted by mogul and UFO enthusiast Robert Bigelow, along with other reports described in two books. The latter reports reference as-yet unreleased databases of international UFO cases, investigations and findings from the \u201cspooky\u201d Skinwalker Ranch in Utah once owned by Bigelow, and monthly reports supposedly delivered to the DIA, along with a 494-page \u201c10 Month Report\u201d replete with charts, graphs and findings. There are good reasons to harbor doubts about these reports\u2019 quality and objectivity.\n\nElizondo\u2019s effort, despite his countless mass media and podcast appearances, has yielded no publicly accessed findings or deliverables proving any claims about a UFO cover-up. These may come to light, but \u201cAARO assesses that the inaccurate claim that the USG [U.S. government] is reverse-engineering extraterrestrial technology and is hiding it from Congress is, in large part, the result of circular reporting from a group of individuals who believe this to be the case, despite a lack of evidence,\u201d that office concluded in its recent report.\n\nThis entire saga shows how pseudoscientific thinking can metastasize in a positive feedback loop, ensnaring not only scientists with paranormal inclinations but also government officials. This was bemoaned by the former head of AARO, Sean Kirkpatrick, who remarked that these officials are tasked with matters of national urgency\u2014a responsibility necessitating a mindset committed to objective investigation and analysis. Some of these officials are on the record casting AARO as part of the \u201ccover-up.\u201d Indeed, the UFO belief system has long ago morphed into a type of faith requiring no evidence.\n\nThe fact that officials harboring evidence-deficient beliefs regarding extraterrestrials and \u201chigh strangeness\u201d (a term first popularized in the early 1970s by ufologists to describe certain bizarre and seemingly absurd elements of some UFO and \u201calien\u201d encounters) are entrusted with national security matters should give one pause. America\u2019s adversaries, to the extent that they are paying attention to the UFO mess, might well regard it as yet another avenue to undermine American institutions\u2014somewhat reflecting a CIA panel\u2019s 1953 warning about potential Soviet exploitation of the genre.\n\nOn a more positive note, ufology is now in vogue among historians keen to understand the mythical nature of the problem and how it relates to historical waves of aerial phenomena reports. Because of how modern media, and especially now digital media, magnify the voices of breathless advocates, sundry frauds and scientists with a penchant for the paranormal, the UFO phenomenon from 1947 onward has acquired much greater gravitas than prior scares and waves, some of which predate it by centuries.\n\nMany serious people dismiss UFOs as a fringe interest or a pop culture distraction. Yes, they are. Yet we maintain, along with an increasing number of scholars, that there is much to be learned from studying UFO sightings, flaps and waves. While our own view is that UFOs, or UAP, emphatically do not represent any truly anomalous physical phenomena such as an extraterrestrial presence, this nevertheless does not consign ufology to insignificance. We should explore its meaning rather than ceding it to sensationalistic advocates employing shoddy methodologies and pushing quasi-religious, otherworldly stories. AARO and academia are thus tasked with an important responsibility that could yield original and fascinating developments into how and why people interpret and react to things they see in the sky.\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

Explore the details of this fascinating extraterrestrial event.\n\nThe trend of information about UFO discoveries making their way from classified government documents to the general public continues.\n\nAccording to a report published by Fox News, the very first image of a mysterious UFO shot down over Canadian airspace last year has finally surfaced. The grainy, almost ghostly photo, which seems to be a photocopy of an email printout, shows a cylindrical object hovering menacingly in the sky just days before a U.S. fighter jet was ordered to take it down. This extraterrestrial drama unfolded in February 2023, as the unidentified craft drifted from Alaska into Canadian skies, sending military forces scrambling.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8BREAKING: FIRST IMAGE OF UFO SHOT DOWN OVER ALASKA RELEASED\n\n\n\nCanada has unveiled the first-ever image of the UFO downed during a joint US-Canada mission in February 2023. The grainy photo shows a circular, white object shot by a US Air Force F-22 fighter jet.\n\n\n\nMilitary\u2026 pic.twitter.com/9ZxmC7QBI5 \u2014 Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) September 24, 2024\n\nThe high-altitude object, detected by NORAD at around 40,000 feet, sent shockwaves through the defense forces on both sides of the border. Canadian authorities were tight-lipped at first, but thanks to an information request from CTVNews to Canada\u2019s Department of National Defence, the photo was finally released to the public. The official description for the UFO is as follows, \u201csmall, metallic balloon with a tethered payload.\u201d\n\nApparently the same object, and/or additional UFOs similar to the one that was shot down, was spotted at least three times between February 10 and February 12 last year. And while many recall the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over South Carolina on February 4, 2023, reports state that the UFO taken down in Canada was much smaller that the aforementioned spy technology.\n\nThe timing of this revelation is uncanny, given the string of UFO encounters that have been making headlines this year. From strange metallic orbs spotted over California to mysterious lights dancing across European skies, and strange flying objects darting across the horizons in Brazil. Overall, it seems 2024 has been a year filled with unexplained aerial activity.\n\nCheck out the images of the UFO above."

        "article_content": "DENVER (KDVR) \u2014 When people think about UFO sightings, it is often imagined as someone alone in a large field of corn with flashing green lights and crop circles. Although rare, UFO sitings are reported in hundreds of places across the U.S., including major cities.\n\nSome of these cities are in proximity to notorious UFO areas like Roswell, New Mexico or Area 51, but most of them are in major cities scattered across the U.S. With millions of eyes in these places, it\u2019s no wonder the sighting rate is higher.\n\nMoose swims alongside paddleboarders at Chatfield Reservoir\n\nBetUS gathered data from the National UFO Reporting Center and composited it based on sightings per city, state and date tracking back from 2013.\n\nThe top 20 visited cities include:\n\nPhoenix, Arizona \u2013 323 UFO sightings New York, New York \u2013 313 UFO sightings Las Vegas, Nevada \u2013 309 UFO sightings Portland, Oregon \u2013 279 UFO sightings Tucson, Arizona \u2013 244 UFO sightings Boise, Idaho \u2013 236 UFO sightings Los Angeles, California \u2013 222 UFO sightings San Diego, California \u2013 220 UFO sightings Albuquerque, New Mexico \u2013 216 UFO sightings Seattle, Washington \u2013 209 UFO sightings Orlando, Florida \u2013 210 UFO sightings Denver, Colorado \u2013 177 UFO sightings Myrtle Beach, South Carolina \u2013 171 UFO sightings Chicago, Illinois \u2013 167 UFO sightings Austin, Texas \u2013 164 UFO sightings Colorado Springs, Colorado \u2013 160 UFO sightings Jacksonville, Florida \u2013150 UFO sightings Spokane, Washington \u2013 146 UFO sightings Columbus, Ohio \u2013 141 UFO sightings Indianapolis, Indiana \u2013 139 UFO sightings\n\nOut of the 20 cities listed, two Colorado cities made the cut. Colorado Springs is one of the smaller, if not smallest cities, on this list, but it still held a high amount of sightings possibly due to the amount of air traffic with the military bases there. Denver, not notorious for its UFO encounters, ranked 12th on the list. Maybe those tunnels under the Denver International Airport aren\u2019t so empty after all.\n\nDenver\u2019s biggest September snowstorm on record: A look back\n\nAnother notable inclusion was Arizona, which was featured in the top five twice. Nevada\u2019s featuring in the top three comes as no surprise due to it containing Area 51, making it possibly the most famous UFO-encountering state in the country.\n\n\u201dThe possibility of extraterrestrial life forms existing out there lives rent-free in the minds of many as they gaze at the night sky and ponder, \u2018Are we alone in this universe?\u2019 This eternal question fuels not just scientific curiosity but also our sense of wonder and imagination. Our rankings have identified when and where in the U.S. you are most likely to see a UFO and find answers to such a profound question,\u201d said Andres Vargas, head content editor at BetUS.\n\nThey also offered a bit of advice for those trying to spot UFOs in Colorado. Head to the quieter outskirts of the city around 10 p.m. and find a high point. The elevation and clear skies of Colorado create the perfect scenario for spotting extraterrestrial visitors.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

        "article_content": "Did a US F-22 shoot down a UFO? Photo of aerial object adds to mystery\n\nRemember February 2023? It was a wild time. There were cocaine-addled bears, mushroom zombies and Air Force fighters shooting sketchy, inflatable objects out of the sky left and right.\n\nThat month began with a Chinese balloon \u2014 the U.S. said it was loaded with spy equipment; Beijing claimed it was just a weather balloon blown off course \u2014 drifting across much of the contiguous United States and igniting a furor. That was before it was blowed up real good \u2014 the technical terminology \u2014 by an F-22 off the coast of South Carolina.\n\nBut February\u2019s bizarre occurrences didn\u2019t stop there. U.S. pilots soon shot down three more mystery objects over Alaska, Canada\u2019s Yukon territory and Lake Huron in as many days.\n\nNone of those subsequent objects were ever recovered, with the official line indicating they were probably hobbyist or research balloons.\n\nBut one grainy image \u2014 it\u2019s always a grainy image, isn\u2019t it? \u2014 of the object shot down over the Yukon has now emerged, and it\u2019s giving significant \u201cI want to believe\u201d vibes.\n\nAn image of the unidentified object shot down over Canada's Yukon territory in Feb. 2023 has been released through a freedom of information request. Thanks to researcher @Steve_uap2020 for sharing this! See \"UAP 23\" & read my latest @CTVNews \ud83d\udc49https://t.co/lx7G5AYceB #FOIA \ud83c\udf41\u2753\ud83d\udd0d \u2014 Daniel Otis (@dsotis) September 24, 2024\n\nCanada\u2019s CTV News obtained a report from their nation\u2019s Department of National Defence on the Feb. 11, 2023 Yukon incident, the contents of which include a brigadier general\u2019s description of the unknown object as \u201ccylindrical,\u201d with a metallic top quarter and the rest of it white. It also mentions a package attached to the object by a 20-foot wire.\n\nThe report contains an unclassified image of the object, which CTV says \u201cappears to be a photocopy of an email printout.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s military originally planned to release the image, but a public affairs official nixed the idea to avoid stirring up more questions. But now that the image has (belatedly) arrived in the public sphere, it\u2019s got aviation \u2014 and UFO \u2014 enthusiasts chattering.\n\nDue to the poor resolution, it remains difficult to tell exactly what the object is. CTV noted that they\u2019ve requested a higher resolution version. Still, the object\u2019s circular shape, containing a gap on the left side, has sparked speculation.\n\nIn the interest of indulging outlandish hypotheses, here are a few of our in-house theories about the true identity of the Yukon object, accompanied by a validity rating system of one spy balloon (least likely) to five spy balloons (most likely).\n\nIt\u2019s the droid control ship from \u2018Star Wars: The Phantom Menace\u2019\n\nThe Yukon object might be too small for this to be the case, but the shape looks identical to something Anakin Skywalker would love to blow up from the inside.\n\nRemember, NORAD: Try spinning, that\u2019s a good trick.\n\n4/5 spy balloons\n\nIt\u2019s the Millennium Falcon\n\nOK, this one is a stretch, but we needed to include something from a non-Jar Jar \u201cStar Wars\u201d film.\n\nThe image obviously doesn\u2019t have the side-mounted cockpit Han and Chewie used to barnstorm around the galaxy, but one can detect hints of the forward mandibles that gave their YT-1300 light freighter its iconic silhouette. If you squint hard, maybe you can see it?\n\n1/5 spy balloons\n\nIt\u2019s a UFO\n\nUFO researcher and government transparency activist John Greenewald, who runs the Black Vault database, noted the similarities between the shape of the Yukon object and the subject of a video purportedly taken in Busan, South Korea, in 2012.\n\n\u201cThe object in the [Busan] UFO video has a striking resemblance to the official photo release of the unknown object (\u201dballoon\u201d?) shot down over the Yukon in 2023,\u201d Greenewald tweeted. \u201cCoincidence? Connection? \u2026 I\u2019m posting without endorsement, but rather, for discussion.\u201d\n\n3/5 spy balloons\n\nIt\u2019s a frakking Cylon Raider!\n\nJust look at that thing. It\u2019s the spitting image of a Cylon Raider fighter \u2014 with its swept-forward wings \u2014 from the reimagined \u201cBattlestar Galactica.\u201d\n\nWe never knew fighting toasters was one of NORAD\u2019s missions, but after seeing how they handled this one, we feel a lot better. So say we all!\n\n5/5 spy balloons\n\nIt\u2019s Peloton, the Roman goddess of wealthy stationary cyclists (not really)\n\nJust look at Peloton\u2019s logo and compare it to the unidentified object in the photo.\n\nIs it really out of the realm of possibility that amid the mass hysteria that was 2020\u2032s pandemic-prompted Peloton-palooza that the interconnected exercise network took tangible, sentient form and bicycled its way out of the hearts of millionaire cardio enthusiasts and into the celestial domain?\n\n\u201cPeloton did not wake up to be mediocre,\u201d Peloton reportedly said.\n\n7/5 spy balloons\n\nIt\u2019s Pac-Man\n\nIf this is the case, with Pac-Man\u2019s insatiable hunger and apparent new flight capabilities, God help us all.\n\n5/5 spy balloons"

        "article_content": "Presented by AMD\n\nThis article is part of a VB Special Issue called \u201cFit for Purpose: Tailoring AI Infrastructure.\u201d Catch all the other stories here.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of any enterprise technology having a greater impact on business today than artificial intelligence (AI), with use cases including automating processes, customizing user experiences, and gaining insights from massive amounts of data.\n\nAs a result, there is a realization that AI has become a core differentiator that needs to be built into every organization\u2019s strategy. Some were surprised when Google announced in 2016 that they would be a mobile-first company, recognizing that mobile devices had become the dominant user platform. Today, some companies call themselves \u2018AI first,\u2019 acknowledging that their networking and infrastructure must be engineered to support AI above all else.\n\nFailing to address the challenges of supporting AI workloads has become a significant business risk, with laggards set to be left trailing AI-first competitors who are using AI to drive growth and speed towards a leadership position in the marketplace.\n\nHowever, adopting AI has pros and cons. AI-based applications create a platform for businesses to drive revenue and market share, for example by enabling efficiency and productivity improvements through automation. But the transformation can be difficult to achieve. AI workloads require massive processing power and significant storage capacity, putting strain on already complex and stretched enterprise computing infrastructures.\n\n>>Don\u2019t miss our special issue: Fit for Purpose: Tailoring AI Infrastructure.<<\n\nIn addition to centralized data center resources, most AI deployments have multiple touchpoints across user devices including desktops, laptops, phones and tablets. AI is increasingly being used on edge and endpoint devices, enabling data to be collected and analyzed close to the source, for greater processing speed and reliability. For IT teams, a large part of the AI discussion is about infrastructure cost and location. Do they have enough processing power and data storage? Are their AI solutions located where they run best \u2014 at on-premises data centers or, increasingly, in the cloud or at the edge?\n\nHow enterprises can succeed at AI\n\nIf you want to become an AI-first organization, then one of the biggest challenges is building the specialized infrastructure that this requires. Few organizations have the time or money to build massive new data centers to support power-hungry AI applications.\n\nThe reality for most businesses is that they will have to determine a way to adapt and modernize their data centers to support an AI-first mentality.\n\nBut where do you start? In the early days of cloud computing, cloud service providers (CSPs) offered simple, scalable compute and storage \u2014 CSPs were considered a simple deployment path for undifferentiated business workloads. Today, the landscape is dramatically different, with new AI-centric CSPs offering cloud solutions specifically designed for AI workloads and, increasingly, hybrid AI setups that span on-premises IT and cloud services.\n\nAI is a complex proposition and there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution. It can be difficult to know what to do. For many organizations, help comes from their strategic technology partners who understand AI and can advise them on how to create and deliver AI applications that meet their specific objectives \u2014 and will help them grow their businesses.\n\nWith data centers, often a significant part of an AI application, a key element of any strategic partner\u2019s role is enabling data center modernization. One example is the rise in servers and processors specifically designed for AI. By adopting specific AI-focused data center technologies, it\u2019s possible to deliver significantly more compute power through fewer processors, servers, and racks, enabling you to reduce the data center footprint required by your AI applications. This can increase energy efficiency and also reduce the total cost of investment (TCO) for your AI projects.\n\nA strategic partner can also advise you on graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms. GPU efficiency is key to AI success, particularly for training AI models, real-time processing or decision-making. Simply adding GPUs won\u2019t overcome processing bottlenecks. With a well implemented, AI-specific GPU platform, you can optimize for the specific AI projects you need to run and spend only on the resources this requires. This improves your return on investment (ROI), as well as the cost-effectiveness (and energy efficiency) of your data center resources.\n\nSimilarly, a good partner can help you identify which AI workloads truly require GPU-acceleration, and which have greater cost effectiveness when running on CPU-only infrastructure. For example, AI Inference workloads are best deployed on CPUs when model sizes are smaller or when AI is a smaller percentage of the overall server workload mix. This is an important consideration when planning an AI strategy because GPU accelerators, while often critical for training and large model deployment, can be costly to obtain and operate.\n\nData center networking is also critical for delivering the scale of processing that AI applications require. An experienced technology partner can give you advice about networking options at all levels (including rack, pod and campus) as well as helping you to understand the balance and trade-off between different proprietary and industry-standard technologies.\n\nWhat to look for in your partnerships\n\nYour strategic partner for your journey to an AI-first infrastructure must combine expertise with an advanced portfolio of AI solutions designed for the cloud and on-premises data centers, user devices, edge and endpoints.\n\nAMD, for example, is helping organizations to leverage AI in their existing data centers. AMD EPYC(TM) processors can drive rack-level consolidation, enabling enterprises to run the same workloads on fewer servers, CPU AI performance for small and mixed AI workloads, and improved GPU performance, supporting advanced GPU accelerators and minimize computing bottlenecks. Through consolidation with AMD EPYC\u2122 processors data center space and power can be freed to enable deployment of AI-specialized servers.\n\nThe increase in demand for AI application support across the business is putting pressure on aging infrastructure.

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nThis article is part of a VB Special Issue called \u201cFit for Purpose: Tailoring AI Infrastructure.\u201d Catch all the other stories here.\n\nWith more enterprises looking to build more AI applications or even AI agents, it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that organizations should use different language models and databases to get the best results.\n\nHowever, switching an application from Llama 3 to Mistral in a flash may take a bit of technology infrastructure finesse. This is where the context and orchestration layer comes in; the so-called middle layer that connects foundation models to applications will ideally control the traffic of API calls to models to execute tasks.\n\nThe middle layer mainly consists of software like LangChain or LlamaIndex that help bridge databases, but the question is, will the middle layer solely consist of software, or is there a role hardware can still play here beyond powering much of the models that power AI applications in the first place.\n\nThe answer is that hardware\u2019s role is to support frameworks like LangChain and the databases that bring applications to life. Enterprises need to have hardware stacks that can handle massive data flows and even look at devices that can do a lot of data center work on device.\n\n>>Don\u2019t miss our special issue: Fit for Purpose: Tailoring AI Infrastructure.<<\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s true that the AI middle layer is primarily a software concern, hardware providers can significantly impact its performance and efficiency,\u201d said Scott Gnau, head of data platforms at data management company InterSystems.\n\nMany AI infrastructure experts told VentureBeat that while software underpins AI orchestration, none would work if the servers and GPUs could not handle massive data movement.\n\nIn other words, for the software AI orchestration layer to work, the hardware layer needs to be smart and efficient, focusing on high-bandwidth, low-latency connections to data and models to handle heavy workloads.\n\n\u201cThis model orchestration layer needs to be backed with fast chips,\u201d said Matt Candy, managing partner of generative AI at IBM Consulting, in an interview. \u201cI could see a world where the silicon/chips/servers are able to optimize based on the type and size of the model being used for different tasks as the orchestration layer is switching between them.\u201d\n\nCurrent GPUs, if you have access, will already work\n\nJohn Roese, global CTO and chief AI officer at Dell, told VentureBeat that hardware like the ones Dell makes still has a role in this middle layer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s both a hardware and software issue because the thing people forget about AI is that it appears as software,\u201d Roese said. \u201cSoftware always runs on hardware, and AI software is the most demanding we\u2019ve ever built, so you have to understand the performance layer of where are the MIPs, where is the compute to make these things work properly.\u201d\n\nThis AI middle layer may need fast, powerful hardware, but there is no need for new specialized hardware beyond the GPUs and other chips currently available.\n\n\u201cCertainly, hardware is a key enabler, but I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s specialized hardware that would really move it forward, other than the GPUs that make the models run faster, Gnau said. \u201cI think software and architecture are where you can optimize in a kind fabric-y way the ability to minimize data movement.\u201d\n\nAI agents make AI orchestration even more important\n\nThe rise of AI agents has made strengthening the middle layer even more critical. When AI agents start talking to other agents and doing multiple API calls, the orchestration layer directs that traffic and fast servers are crucial.\n\n\u201cThis layer also provides seamless API access to all of the different types of AI models and technology and a seamless user experience layer that wraps around them all,\u201d said IBM\u2019s Candy. \u201cI call it an AI controller in this middleware stack.\u201d\n\nAI agents are the current hot topic for the industry, and they will likely influence how enterprises build a lot of their AI infrastructure going forward.\n\nRoese added another thing enterprises need to consider: on-device AI, another hot topic in the space. He said companies will want to imagine when their AI agents will need to run locally because the old internet may go down.\n\n\u201cThe second thing to consider is where do you run?\u201d Roese said. \u201cThat\u2019s where things like the AI PC comes into play because the minute I have a collection of agents working on my behalf and they can talk to each other, do they all have to be in the same place.\u201d\n\nHe added Dell explored the possibility of adding \u201cconcierge\u201d agents on device \u201cso if you\u2019re ever disconnected from the internet, you can continue doing your job.\u201d\n\nExplosion of the tech stack now, but not always\n\nGenerative AI has allowed the expansion of the tech stack, as more tasks became more abstracted, bringing new service providers offering GPU space, new databases or AIOps services. This won\u2019t be the case forever, said Uniphore CEO Umesh Sachdev, and enterprises must remember that.\n\n\u201cThe tech stack has exploded, but I do think we\u2019re going to see it normalize,\u201d said Sachdev. \u201cEventually, people will bring things in-house and the capacity demand in GPUs will ease out. The layer and vendor explosion always happens with new technologies and we\u2019re going to see the same with AI.\u201d\n\nFor enterprises, it\u2019s clear that thinking about the entire AI ecosystem, from software to hardware, is the best practice for AI workflows that make sense."

        "article_content": "15 years ago, this movie took the world by surprise \u2026 and scared everyone who saw it\n\nFifteen years ago, on September 25, 2009, Paranormal Activity was released in theaters and scared the pants out of audiences everywhere. Even before the movie\u2019s premiere, it had already become legendary. Instead of debuting via a massive theatrical release rollout, the micro-budgeted movie was screened in college towns across the country to drum up word of mouth.\n\nIt worked. Thanks to the (somewhat still new) popularity of Facebook and the prominence of texting on phones, Paranormal Activity didn\u2019t need a marketing campaign. Frightened audiences told everyone they knew about the scary movie they just watched. Soon, the internet was ablaze with word of this new movie that didn\u2019t have stars anyone had heard of before.\n\nThe birth of a new horror franchise\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nFilmed in the found-footage style, the movie centers around a young couple, Micah and Katie, who are determined to capture the paranormal activity happening in their house. But it\u2019s not just a ghost that\u2019s haunting them, it\u2019s a demon. Even worse, the more attention they give to it, the stronger and more active it becomes.\n\nParamount realized Paranormal Activity was destined to become a hit and picked it up for wide distribution. When the movie finally premiered in theaters across the country, audiences were terrified. When speaking to Empire, Jordan Peele recounted his experience seeing the movie in theaters. \u201cWhen the s*** hit the fan, Katie is dragged out of the room screaming. The audience absolutely lost it,\u201d the horror icon said.\n\nSince then, Paranormal Activity has received six sequels and has become one of the most prominent examples of found-footage movies ever. It\u2019s also just as scary as it was in 2009, and aside from the dated use of the camcorder, it still looks and feels terrifying.\n\nParanormal Activity was genuinely scary to a desensitized audience\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nPeele isn\u2019t the only one who was horrified by Paranormal Activity. In 2009 Roger Ebert even gave the movie 3.5 out of 4 stars, saying, \u201cIt illustrates one of my favorite points, that silence and waiting can be more entertaining than frantic fast-cutting and berserk f/x.\u201d\n\nThe movie was so scary that its trailers even used audience footage from its screenings to show how horrified moviegoers were. By the end of its box office run, Paranormal Activity had raked in over $193 million.\n\nSimilarly to The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity gets a lot of its horror from what audiences don\u2019t see. Strange sounds and small movements captured by the camera seem trivial, but when the movie\u2019s pacing is flawless, each small instance can feel monumental and the anticipation that builds between them is undeniable.\n\nAs the movie continues, the stakes get higher and the hauntings more intense. But the film never uses special effects or has some haggard-looking ghost running around. Even its \u201cbig moments\u201d are subtle compared to other horror movies. For example, at one point Micah scatters baby powder around the floor to see if something really is walking through their house at night. When he turns the lights on, the prints left behind look like some kind of lizard or bird.\n\nEven as someone who doesn\u2019t believe in the paranormal, this movie still gets to me. It utilizes our natural fears, like being in a big, empty, dark house at night \u2014 and then hearing a strange sound in the hallway.\n\nBut the movie definitely requires some patience. If you like being scared by CGI-generated monsters and loud musical cues, then this probably isn\u2019t the movie for you. But if you turn off all the lights in a quiet room late at night and watch Paranormal Activity, you will discover just how horrifying it is.\n\nParanormal Activity ushered in the paranormal horror era\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nThe success of Paranormal Activity was so massive it created a sea change in the horror genre. When the film premiered initially in 2007 and then had its full release in 2009, horror was in its full-blown \u201ctorture porn\u201d phase, where filmmakers were doing everything they could to have the goriest and grossest torture movie possible. The Saw franchise, Hostel, and The Hills Have Eyes reboots were proving to be box office hits, and The Human Centipede had just made its debut at FrightFest.\n\nBut after Paranormal Activity outgrossed all those movies (Saw II for example was the highest-grossing Saw film, making just under $148 million, which was $40 million less than Paranormal Activity), Hollywood realized a new horror trend may have just emerged. The torture porn trend ended almost immediately after Paranormal Activity, and by the following year, the paranormal era was hitting high gear and gore was gone.\n\nAfter Paranormal Activity, more paranormal horror films followed, including numerous Paranormal Activity sequels, as well as Insidious and The Conjuring, both of which would spawn their own massive franchises. There was also a wave of other low-budget found-footage paranormal movies that, while never making a huge splash, became notable hits within the horror community, like Hell House LLC, Grave Encounters, and The Taking of Deborah Logan.\n\nNow could be the perfect time for a new Paranormal Activity\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nParanormal Activity was made and released during a period of massive change. Social media had just become a widely used tool by society, and smartphones had just started rolling out to the general public.\n\nNew technology that wasn\u2019t around at the time of its release could be used to make a really fun modern Paranormal Activity sequel or reboot. Between Nest cams, doorbell cameras, smartphones, drones, and even dashcams, there are so many new tools that could be used to reinvent the found-footage genre and add new touches.\n\nThe streaming era could also be helpful, since studios don\u2019t need to invest as much money into theatrical releases and instead can release low-budget movies on their streaming platforms for much less investment. With how cheap the Paranormal Activity movies are to make, they could be perfect for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Shudder, or even Tubi.\n\nAnother reason why now could be the perfect time for a new Paranormal Activity movie is that belief in the paranormal has actually risen in recent years. There\u2019s a lot of really touchy topics that have probably caused this \u2014 largely America\u2019s regression into fanaticism and conspiratorial thinking \u2014 but modern studies have shown some shocking results. In 2021, it was reported that 57% of Americans believe in ghosts, and in 2023 another study revealed that over half of Americans think they\u2019ve actually been visited by a ghost.\n\nThese findings might make some of us question our fellow Americans and their belief systems, but for Hollywood and anyone wanting to make a paranormal movie to scare the crap out of people\u2026now seems to be the perfect time.\n\nYou can watch Paranormal Activity on Max."

        "article_content": "Church attendance has sharply declined, and the number of people who express interest in religion is decreasing. Vermont, New Hampshire, Washington, Oregon, and Maine reported the lowest percentage of adults who say they attend church or religious services. The biggest drop in attendance in the past 20 years has been amongst U.S. Catholics.\n\nAt the same time, belief in the paranormal is becoming more common. Seventy-five percent of us believe in the paranormal and about 20 percent of Americans claim that they have actually seen a ghost. Research suggests that both belief in the paranormal and religiosity are characterized by similar brain states that also underlie anxiety, proneness to suggestion and fantasy, and limited critical thinking.\n\nWhy are atheism and belief in the paranormal becoming increasingly popular? Is the human brain evolving away from one form of fantasy beliefs while embracing another? Possibly, but it is impossible to ignore the fact that religious beliefs and acceptance of the paranormal have been a durable feature of the world\u2019s cultures for many millennia. Anthropologists estimate that at least 18,000 different gods, goddesses, and various animals or objects have been worshiped by humans since our species first appeared. Evolution has clearly selected for a brain that has the ability to accept a logically absurd world of supernatural causes and beings.\n\nRecent studies have investigated which resting state brain circuits and which frequency states are utilized by skeptical nonbelievers as compared to believers. Previous studies have demonstrated that a resting state analysis is objective, stable, and capable of revealing individual differences in how the brain functions. Essentially, the analysis provides a kind of \"neural fingerprint\" of which brain regions are involved in the processing of emotions, memories, and thoughts. The believers studied were Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, or other.\n\nNot believing in a god is due to the activation of distinct higher-order brain networks.\n\nThe results demonstrated that religious believers are more likely to use more intuitive and heuristic reasoning and that religious nonbelievers are more likely to use more deliberative and analytic reasoning. For example, nonbelievers are more likely to process sensory information, such as something they see, in a more deliberative manner that involves higher cortical areas, called top-down processing, involved in reasoning. In contrast, religious believers are more likely to interpret visual information in a more emotional or intuitive manner, called bottom-up processing, that involves more ancient brain systems. Religious believers share this bottom-up processing bias with people who believe in the supernatural or paranormal activity, such as telekinesis or clairvoyance. Recent evidence suggests that religious fundamentalists have a network of brain regions located in the right hemisphere that may be damaged by injury or simply inherited.\n\nParanormal believers' thinking is frequently biased by intuitive beliefs. An analysis of brain states showed that paranormal belief is related to the reduced power of the alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands, all indicative of a reduced level of inhibitory control and critical analysis of incoming sensory information. (To learn more about alpha and beta waves, go here.)\n\nThe increase in the number of religious nonbelievers and paranormal believers may be in response to shifts in our culture as well as more accurate scientific explanations for natural phenomena that once depended on the intervention of mythical beings. The shift may indicate that our brain requires some form of fantasy belief and that gods are simply being replaced by ghosts."

        "article_content": "The most likely way we will discover life on a distant exoplanet is by discovering a biosignature. This can be done by looking at the atmospheric spectra of a world to discover the spectral pattern of a molecule that can only be created through biological processes.\n\nWhile it sounds straightforward, it isn't. The presence of simple molecules such as water and oxygen don't prove life exists on a planet. It's true that Earth's atmosphere is oxygen rich thanks to life, but geological activity can also produce large quantities of oxygen.\n\nAnd as a new study shows, some molecules we've long thought to be biological in origin may not be.\n\nIdeally astronomers would love to find evidence of a really complex molecule such as chlorophyll. But there isn't likely to be tons of chlorophyll in an atmosphere, so the spectral pattern would be faint, and even if it were clear the pattern is complex and hard to distinguish.\n\nSo astronomers generally focus on simpler but unique molecules. One of these molecules is dimethyl sulfide, (CH 3 ) 2 S or DMS for short. It is only produced by phytoplankton on Earth, so it would be a strong indicator of life. Or so we thought.\n\nIn this new work the team was able to synthesize DMS and other sulfur-based molecules in the lab abiotically. While that doesn't prove the same process can happen in the wild, the team went on to show how DMS could be formed on a world with a thick organic haze.\n\nWe know such planets exist because Saturn's moon Titan is just such a world. If, for example, Titan happened to be closer to the Sun, the ultraviolet radiation would be significant enough to trigger the chemical reactions necessary to create DMS.\n\nIf Titan were in Earth's orbit, a distant alien race would detect DMS in the atmosphere of a planet in the Sun's habitable zone. It would look like a slam dunk, but Titan would still be toxic to life as we know it.\n\nBut Titan might have some presence of exotic life, which is another conclusion to this study. While the authors show that the presence of DMS or similar molecules wouldn't prove life exists on a world, they argue that it would indicate a strong potential for life.\n\nBasically, a warm planet with the kind of rich organic haze in its atmosphere would necessarily have the kind of complex organic molecules life needs to evolve. If DMS exists on a world, then the potential for life exists at the very least.\n\nWhile this study shows we will need to be careful about treating particular molecules as biosignatures, it also supports what exo-biologists have known for some time.\n\nThe discovery of life on another world isn't likely going to happen as a single great eureka moment. What is more likely is that a handful of planets will have chemical markers that support the possibility of life.\n\nOver time as we find more candidate biomarkers in their atmospheres we will be ever more confident that life exists.\n\nThis article was originally published by Universe Today.

        "article_content": "For uncovering how a cell population helps ensure food, liquid and acid reflux are kept out of our airway \u2013 and instead sent to our GI tract \u2013 Laura Seeholzer is the winner of the 2024 Eppendorf & Science Prize for Neurobiology. Her findings, detailed in April in Science, have motivated her to study what\u2019s happening with these cells in diseases where this critical protective reflex is compromised.\n\n\u201cThese findings are crucial for understanding potentially life-saving reflexes that are activated in the airway, in response to noxious stimuli,\u201d said Peter Stern, Senior Editor at Science, who oversaw the prize.\n\nFor most every breath we take and most every morsel or sip we consume, the lungs are protected. Air enters the lungs, but food, liquid and stomach acid are sent to the GI tract.\n\nIn a flash, however, this process can go wrong \u2013 a foreign agent can get into our airway. This can cause discomfort, at minimum. And at worst it can lead to airway blockage, acid-induced lung damage, or aspiration pneumonia \u2013 outcomes that occur frequently in people with neurological or esophageal disorders and which are a leading cause of aspiration pneumonia and mortality in older people.\n\nScientists already know that sensory systems in the upper airway, namely the larynx and trachea, rapidly detect the things that we need to exclude from our lungs. Innervated with sensory nerve fibers, the larynx and trachea respond to foreign agents \u2013 and clear them.\n\nBut scientists don\u2019t know if the nerve fibers in the larynx and trachea act alone.\n\nSeeholzer\u2019s work uncovered another entity \u2013 neuroendocrine cells \u2013 that operate in the larynx and trachea, to play a protective role. In her prize essay, \u201c(Don\u2019t) take my breath away,\u201d Seeholzer \u2013 a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California San Francisco \u2013 writes, \u201cyou should thank your neuroendocrine cells the next time you clear water or acid reflux out of your airway.\u201d\n\nNeuroendocrine (NE) cells are a rare group of epithelial cells throughout the larynx and trachea. They have been understood for their important role in repairing the airway epithelium after injury.\n\nThey had not been thought to be involved in airway protection.\n\nHowever, because these cells are near sensory nerve fibers, Seeholzer and her colleagues speculated that they could be specialized sensory cells that play a role in protecting our lungs.\n\nSeeholzer said she wasn\u2019t even sure there were NE cells in the trachea and larynx when she started her work. \u201cI started from the ground up, learning how these cells operate. I then used that to generate a hypothesis about their importance in the airway.\u201d\n\nHer efforts involved work in cells and in mice \u2013 and methods including calcium imaging, electrophysiology, and optogenetics.\n\nThe road wasn\u2019t always easy.\n\n\u201cI had been studying NE cells for a year or two to figure out what they detect, which could inform what they do,\u201d said Seeholzer. \u201cI performed a sequencing experiment to see what the cells expressed. When I looked at the data, not many receptors were expressed that supported my hypothesis that these were sensory cells that could detect stimuli that could get into the airway. The sequencing led to all dead ends.\u201d\n\nSeeholzer did not give up, however. She spoke with David Julius, her mentor, and professor and chair of physiology at UCSF. She explained her sequencing work was not revealing what NE cells detected. \u201cHe encouraged me to step back and think about what they could be detecting, and to use that to nominate substances the NE cells could be frequently exposed to.\u201d\n\nThat led to an \u201cah-hah!\u201d moment she describes in her essay, where she changed how she set up her experiments. As a result, she discovered that water and strong acid solutions (like stomach acid) very consistently activated the NE cells.\n\nShe then sought to understand what the water and acid did to the cells. Using optogenetic techniques, she could specifically activate NE cells in mice. \u201cWhen I did that, the mice started swallowing very quickly.\u201d Seeholzer attached a device to the mice to study related changes in breathing. \u201cI very consistently saw that activating NE cells led to swallows and to cough-like reflexes.\u201d That supported her hypothesis that NE cells were detecting water and acid to elicit protective responses in the airway, to keep foreign substances out.\n\nShe says NE cells add another layer \u2013 on top of sensory neurons researchers have previously studied \u2013 giving full protection in the airway. This was further evidenced by experiments in mice in which the NE cells were knocked out; this led to the airway not being fully protected against foreign threats.\n\nNow having done work in mice, Seeholzer wants to understand how these cells operate in healthy and diseased humans. Her findings suggest these cells are not functioning properly in people with dysphagia, which is the inability to swallow well \u2013 a major cause of mortality. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in looking at patients who aspirate frequently to see if there\u2019s something going on with cells there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m interested in looking at what happens with these cells in people who smoke, where dysphagia is also more prevalent.\u201d\n\nThere are also implications for people with refractory chronic cough, where the NE cells may be hyperactivated.\n\n\u201cEppendorf and the journal Science have been awarding this prestigious prize since 2002,\u201d said Axel Jahns, Vice President of Corporate Citizenship & Governmental Affairs at Eppendorf SE. \u201cSince its initiation, the prize has acknowledged over 70 winners and finalists, who have gone on to become leading scientists in their field. Congratulations to Dr. Seeholzer on her amazing achievement in winning this year.\u201d\n\nSeeholzer expressed how her supportive lab environment made it possible to achieve the findings she did, even after significant obstacles. \u201cThe lab I\u2019m in really made all the work fun and enjoyable,\u201d she said.\n\nFinalists\n\nRosemary J. Cater is a finalist for the prize, for her essay, \u201cFood for thought.\u201d Cater received her undergraduate degree and PhD from The University of Sydney. After completing her postdoctoral fellowship at Columbia University, she started her laboratory at the University of Queensland\u2019s Institute for Molecular Bioscience in 2024. Her research uses an integrated structural biology approach to understand how nutrients obtained through the diet are transported across the blood-brain barrier.\n\nClaudia Kathe is also a finalist for the prize, for her essay, \u201cRewiring movements.\u201d Kathe received an undergraduate degree and PhD from King\u2019s College London. After completing her postdoctoral fellowship at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), she started her laboratory in the Department of Fundamental Neuroscience at the University of Lausanne in 2024. Her research investigates the reorganization of neuronal networks in the spinal cord in neurological disorders and its impact on sensorimotor function."

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nJust as enterprises continue to adopt large language model-powered text-to-SQL as a way to \u2018talk\u2019 to their data assets, a new shift in the ecosystem has started emerging: AI agents. Today, New York-based Redbird announced a new chat platform that uses \u201cspecialist agents\u201d to help enterprises handle most analytics value chain tasks, from data collection and engineering to data science and producing actual insights (reporting).\n\nThis means an enterprise user can give a natural language prompt to get insights from data in almost real-time and execute analytical efforts that pave the way for those insights. According to Erin Tavgac, the co-founder and CEO of the company, this represents more than 90% of an enterprise\u2019s business intelligence efforts.\n\n\u201cFor the past several decades the promise of truly self-serve analytics has fallen short for organizations, with the reality instead being complex data pipelines, dashboards, and shadow analytics that require technical skills. We have invested significant R&D into fusing the power of LLMs with Redbird\u2019s robust end-to-end analytical toolkit in the form of AI agents that enable users to finally achieve self-serve, conversational BI that runs on their organization\u2019s data,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nMoving into the age of AI agents\n\nWhile the age of AI agents is new, Redbird itself has been a long-standing player in the analytics domain. The company started in 2018 as Cube Analytics and provided enterprises with a no-code, drag-and-drop toolkit that enabled their users to create workflows aimed at automating and unifying all analytical tasks leading to dashboarding and insights. Earlier this year, the company expanded this work with the launch of a conversational interface, allowing users to ask business questions in natural language and receive insights and reporting outputs in real-time.\n\nNow, as the next step, Redbird has added an ecosystem of specialized agents that operate on top of this end-to-end toolkit to orchestrate as well as execute multi-step analytical tasks to answer business-related questions.\n\nAs Tavgac explained, admins setting up the chat platform have to choose a base LLM (like GPT, Llama etc) and load up their organization\u2019s proprietary data ontologies, business logic and reporting blueprints (like business definitions, PowerPoint report templates, etc.) to customize it with relevant business context. Once the data is inputted, the AI agents using the LLM begin to use all the context and generate metadata from the information to do their work \u2014 in response to user questions.\n\n\u201cUser prompts are sent to Redbird routing agents, which identify the best specialist agents to execute the tasks for that prompt (like PowerPoint Reporting agent, Data Engineering agent, etc.) and figure out how to orchestrate the execution order of those agents. Each specialist agent then manages its own part of the overall task by identifying relevant datasets/ontologies and executing the needed task using the Redbird toolkit, which includes applications and functions to handle the mechanical steps of the pipeline,\u201d Tavgac noted.\n\nDetailing the tasks, he noted Redbird agents can pull unstructured or structured data from over 100 data sources, including Snowflake, Databricks and Hubspot. It can run advanced processing on top of the collected data by performing data wrangling, AI-driven tagging and data science modeling. It can also generate robust reporting outputs (like presentations, Excel reports and email/Slack updates) while taking necessary actions based on those reports (like executing an ad buy/modifying a campaign).\n\n\u201cOnce the task is executed, the chat platform responds to the user with not just a text answer but also any deliverables needed, like a PowerPoint report the agents built or the data that they collected from a SaaS system,\u201d he said.\n\nRedbird Platform Screenshot \u2013 AI Chat (Marketing Analytics)\n\nNo-code workflow orchestration remains available\n\nAs enterprises double down on their data efforts, going beyond text-to-SQL \u2014 adopted by Dremio, Snowflake and many others \u2013 and streamlining the analytics pipeline end-to-end with AI agents could be a great way to save time and resources.\n\nHowever, as many may still have concerns over the reliability of AI agents, Redbird is not doing away with its original drag-and-drop interface for automating business intelligence workflows. Instead, the company has made no-code the secondary option for users. The agents will orchestrate the tasks while also creating a no-code version of the workflow, allowing users to audit and inspect everything in detail if required.\n\n\u201cSo far, existing AI solutions have primarily tackled the automation of a very small fraction of BI and analytics efforts (SQL querying). While Redbird values and solves for that use case (text-to-SQL), it is also applying the power of its AI agents to automate the other more difficult and more sizable parts of enterprise BI workflows\u2026 Our approach to solving this challenge has enabled us to onboard eight of the Fortune 50 brands and over 30 mid-to-large-sized enterprise customers in the last few months,\u201d Tavgac added. This includes brands like Mondelez International, USA Today, Bobcat Company and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nCurrently, he said the company is offering its technology on a SaaS model with usage-based licensing fees and generating seven-figure revenue. However, he did not share the exact specifics.\n\nAs the next step, Redbird will continue its AI agent-driven work and take its new Chat platform to more enterprises. It also plans to add more advanced agents in the analytics value chain to enable even deeper AI-powered business intelligence coverage for non-technical users.\n\n\u201cWe also aim to expand beyond our primary focus on analytics / BI use cases and into a deeper \u2018Large Action Model\u2019 approach that leverages AI agents that can take more nuanced action based on the analytical results (i.e. purchase supplies, send invoices)."

        "article_content": "Understanding that the development of Caleb Williams is at or near the top of Shane Waldron\u2019s job description, the Chicago Bears can share optimism in the fact the rookie quarterback has improved each of the last two weeks.\n\nWilliams\u2019 completion percentage, yards and yards per attempt have increased in the two losses since the season-opening victory against the Tennessee Titans, and he\u2019s coming off a 363-yard effort against the Colts on Sunday in Indianapolis that included two touchdown passes.\n\nWilliams looks to be improving incrementally, and while it\u2019s never going to be a linear progression, he already looks more comfortable than any Bears rookie quarterback has in a long time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of new as we all know,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWide receivers, running backs, quarterback, the offensive linemen and all these different parts. Us constantly having the encouragement mindset, but also the positivity that we see on the actual film \u2014 if you actually watch it and not get into all the emotions of the game.\n\n\u201cYes, we do need to get it going a little bit more efficiently than we are. But the growth and positivity that we have within the film that we\u2019ve seen and things like that over these past couple of weeks (is encouraging).\u201d\n\nThe overall picture for the offense, though, has been murky \u2014 to put it nicely. Waldron\u2019s unit has struggled to form any kind of identity. The offense has been particularly bad in a handful of areas and hasn\u2019t scored enough. It\u2019s a familiar movie and without improvements will offer a familiar ending.\n\nThe Bears have three offensive touchdowns, tying them for last in the NFL with the Denver Broncos, Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers. The Philadelphia Eagles have yet to score in the first quarter this season. The Bears and Sunday\u2019s opponent at Soldier Field, the Los Angeles Rams, are next worst with three points each.\n\nAsked if he uses a play script to begin games, Waldron labeled that \u201cscheme\u201d related during a fast-talking, 15-minute news conference Thursday morning. It\u2019s worth noting the Bears are No. 2 in the league in fourth-quarter scoring with 30 points.\n\nComing off a rough showing in the 21-16 loss to the Colts, Waldron opened with a statement complimenting the team\u2019s leadership group for being solution-oriented. Interestingly, one player said Waldron was more engaged seeking player input this week. If you heard a coach or player mention communication since Monday, you\u2019ve heard it 100 times.\n\nVeteran Marcedes Lewis is one of the players Waldron credited, along with fellow tight end Cole Kmet, Williams and wide receiver DJ Moore.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel like he can\u2019t point guys out,\u201d Lewis, 40, recalled saying to Waldron. \u201cFrom the oldest guy in the room \u2014 being me \u2014 to the youngest guy. Don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t coach us. I want to be coached. I want to be great. This is not for play. This is our job. We understand that. It\u2019s a highly stressful, production-based business, and we\u2019ve all got to be doing the same things or everybody gets fired. Ego is supposed to be left at the door.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very receptive to that. I think, obviously, coming in, we\u2019ve got a bunch of dudes. Not just guys on the team or on this offense. We have dudes \u2014 dudes who have done it at a high level. Sometimes as the coach coming in, you might be walking on eggshells. I just kind of put that to bed. Nobody\u2019s sensitive in here. We want to win games just as bad as you do. It\u2019s a collaborative effort. This is not Pop Warner.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, Williams probably needed to look like a two-time Pro Bowl selection from the jump to meet some of the audacious expectations put on this offense. Folks dared to dream \u2014 and dream big \u2014 when the Bears chose him with the No. 1 pick in the draft, the most decorated quarterback to join the franchise in decades and the greatest signal of hope to enter Halas Hall perhaps ever.\n\nPredictably, Williams has encountered challenges that make the position difficult to navigate for rookie starters, including myriad pressures and a mixing of coverages with the intent to fool him or cause a delay in his reaction.\n\nAll of that was expected, but the cast of players surrounding Williams, perhaps as good or better than almost any rookie starter has discovered in the last decade or two, was supposed to ease the transition. The Bears invested heavily on offense in the offseason, trading for wide receiver Keenan Allen, who has missed the last two games with plantar fasciitis, drafting receiver Rome Odunze with the No. 9 pick and signing running back D\u2019Andre Swift and tight end Gerald Everett in free agency to join a cast that already included Moore, Kmet and a functional collection of running backs.\n\nEarly results \u2014 and a lot of football remains \u2014 have been discouraging.\n\nPass protection remains an issue. Williams has been sacked 13 times, the same number Justin Fields took through three games a year ago. Only the Cleveland Browns (16) and Tennessee Titans (15) have surrendered more. The line was supposed to look better with a quarterback that could play within the structure of the system a greater percentage of the time. Simply put, it has not.\n\nThe run game has been a mess. The failed goal-line sequence in the second quarter Sunday \u2014 when the Bears started with first-and-goal from the 4-yard line \u2014 is the symbol of what has gone wrong. Poor execution. Poor design \u2014 there\u2019s no other way to describe a play in which wide receiver DeAndre Carter is asked to block a defensive end. Waldron owned that when asked specifically about it. Poor decisions both in the speed option on fourth-and-1 and the failure to check out of the play.\n\nThe Bears are 31st in rushing offense, averaging 72.7 yards per game, and 31st in yards per attempt at a meager 3.03. The Las Vegas Raiders are the only team worse in both categories. The ground attack was expected to take a hit with the departure of Fields, whose ability to threaten defenses inflated rushing production the last two seasons, but it wasn\u2019t expected to be this bad.\n\nFirst down hasn\u2019t been profitable. The offense ranks 29th in the league, averaging 4.26 yards on first-and-10. So, they\u2019re not in desirable second-and-short situations with a lot of regularity, and when they\u2019re playing behind the sticks, it\u2019s tough sledding. According to @SharpFootball, 64% of Bears\u2019 first downs reach third down, the highest percentage in the league. The NFL average is 47%, and only three teams are over 57%. All of that makes it easier for opposing defensive coordinators to make calls on second and third downs.\n\nExplosive plays have been scarce. The Bears have five runs of 10 yards or more. Three are the result of Williams\u2019 scrambles, and Moore had a 14-yard gain on a jet sweep. The lone explosive rush by a running back was Swift\u2019s 20-yard carry in the Week 1 win against the Titans. The Bears have had only four pass plays of 20 yards or more \u2014 three to Odunze and the 44-yard Hail Mary to Moore last week that came 1 yard short of the goal line before halftime.\n\nFormer Bears defensive coordinator Ron Rivera used to say, \u201cfigures lie and liars figure,\u201d but you really need to spend time crunching numbers to paint a pretty picture of the offense overall. Again, it has been only three games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to live in the past but I\u2019m going to learn from it,\u201d Waldron said. \u201cI\u2019m going to move forward. And I believe in that. I\u2019m not going to flinch or blink on any of those things. I\u2019m looking forward for a solution to everything that we\u2019ve been through and can\u2019t wait for the next game.\u201d\n\nThe offensive coordinator taking heat even at this early juncture isn\u2019t surprising. The play caller can become the target of ire faster than you can say \u201cthree Mississippi.\u201d Waldron is the franchise\u2019s 13th coordinator in 26 seasons, and things turned so quickly for predecessor Luke Getsy that in about two months he went from being a guy fans feared was so hot he would be leaving quickly to become a head coach after the Bears averaged 29.6 points in a five-game stretch to the guy who was to blame for the offense\u2019s incompetence.\n\nWaldron is standing up in front of players expressing where he needs to be better. He\u2019s being accountable to his players and listening to them. It was a tough outing overall against a Colts defense that otherwise hasn\u2019t played well.\n\nIt would appear there are spots for improvement \u2014 although that was a good storyline at this time a week ago. The next four opponents have been as bad on defense as some of the areas the Bears have struggled offensively.\n\nSunday: Rams 32nd in yards allowed, 31st in scoring\n\nOct. 6: Panthers 24th, 32nd\n\nOct. 13: Jaguars 26th, 28th\n\nOct. 27, Commanders 29th, 29th\n\nSomething has to give, right?\n\n\u201cHe stands up there and lists the plays that he could have called better,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cPuts it up on the board. We all see it. And I think that\u2019s the best way to do it. I mean, we\u2019re not kids, right? We respect that. Because everything is evaluated, especially from a player\u2019s standpoint.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019re getting evaluated with whatever we\u2019re doing out there. So when a coach throws himself in that pot of gumbo, then we\u2019re all vested, we all have some skin in the game. He\u2019s been doing that and highly appreciate it.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see if all the communication is a means to improvement \u2014 or just more talk."

As educators seek to close learning gaps and address diverse student needs, adaptive technologies have become indispensable. The shift towards remote and blended learning models has also accelerated the adoption of these tools in the K-12 segment. This trend is expected to continue as more schools recognize the benefits of personalized education through adaptive learning platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe higher education sector is another key driver of the adaptive learning software market, particularly as colleges and universities embrace technology-driven learning environments. Adaptive learning platforms help students in higher education by providing personalized content that aligns with their academic goals and learning styles. These tools offer colleges the ability to enhance student engagement, improve retention rates, and support personalized feedback. In addition, the growing need for scalable solutions in large academic institutions has increased the demand for adaptive learning software, which can cater to diverse student populations.

Students and educators alike are seeking more tailored educational experiences that address individual learning needs and preferences. Adaptive learning software uses data-driven insights to adjust content delivery based on each learner's progress, strengths, and weaknesses. This personalized approach improves learning outcomes and engagement, making it a preferred choice in both academic and corporate training environments. As more institutions and organizations focus on student-centric learning models, the demand for adaptive learning platforms is expected to rise, fueling market growth.\n\nAdaptive learning software is gaining traction in the corporate training sector as businesses recognize the value of personalized employee development programs.
