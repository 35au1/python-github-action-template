Even though the scientific community is yet to face any conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life, conspiracy theorists strongly believe that living beings from the distant nooks of the world have already visited planet earth.\n\nAmid all these speculations, the world is currently witnessing a new wave of unidentified flying object sightings in recent days.\n\nSocial Media Platforms Flooded with UFO Videos\n\nSocial media platforms like X and Facebook are currently being flooded with UFO sightings from countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Syria, and Australia.\n\nMost of these UFO sightings feature flying objects that are triangular in shape, which move across the skies without making any sound.\n\nAs UFO sightings rise across various nooks of the globe, conspiracy theorists strongly believe that an alien invasion is imminent.\n\nA few days back, a YouTuber had sensationally claimed that UFOs will start invading the earth on December 3, and conspiracy theorists argue that this prediction has turned true.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon and NASA have also started considering these UFO sightings very seriously, as they believe that the presence of these flying objects could threaten national security.\n\nHowever, authorities are refraining from using the word UFO, and instead they are calling these objects unidentified aerial phenomena.\n\nAre Aliens Time Travelers?\n\nAmid all these debates, Netflix, on December 8, released a documentary named Investigation Aliens.\n\nThe documentary which features George Knapp in the lead role tries to answer several questions including why aliens are visiting earth.\n\nAt the end of the documentary, which has an open-ended nature, makers suggest that UFOs and aliens which people see in the skies could be most probably time traveling humans from the future."

The upgrade included a revamped Siri, AI writing tools, smart replies, an updated Photos app, and a new focus mode called Reduce Interruptions.\n\nIt was a fraction of the flashy AI features Apple showed off at its Worldwide Developer Conference earlier this year, as the company decided to do a staggered rollout. This second wave of features will be followed by more launching next year.\n\nSo what can you expect when you update to iOS 18.2 later this week?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnticipated features in the December update include tools like Genmojis and Image Playground, among others. Like the earlier Apple Intelligence features, the newest AI features will be available for all iPhone 16 models and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.\n\nChatGPT integration\n\nApple's iOS 18.2 introduces ChatGPT integration. Apple\n\nSiri received some enhancements in the iOS 18.1 update, but the iOS 18.2 update will further improve the voice assistant and allow integrated access to ChatGPT. With iOS 18.2, users will have access to the popular OpenAI chatbot through Siri and they'll be able to access the tool by talking to the voice assistant or typing to it.\n\nVisual Intelligence\n\nApple's visual intelligence feature is expected in iOS 18.2 Apple\n\nThe new update will also allow iPhone 16 users to gather information by pointing their device at an object.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tool is similar to Google Lens, which does reverse image searches and helps identify landmarks, plants, and other objects or places.\n\nGenmojis\n\nCreate a personalized \"Genmoji.\" Apple\n\nFor those who prefer to communicate with emojis over the written word, Genmojis could be a game changer.\n\nThe new update allows users to be more playful and interactive in their messages, creating custom emojis right from the keyboard and animated Genmojis of themselves, similar to Bitmoji.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage Playground\n\nImage Playground was introduced at Apple's WWDC 2024. Apple\n\nApple's Image Playground is its answer to popular AI image generators like OpenAI's Dall-E or Midjourney. The tool was first demonstrated at Apple's WWDC conference earlier this year.\n\nRelated stories\n\nImage Playground users can create images based on a specific description or concept and will be able to select different formats like animation. The tool will be available as its own app and will also be accessible through third-party apps.\n\nPhoto updates\n\niOS 18.2 is expected to introduce several photo updates, including video enhancements like improvements for navigating Collections and the ability to view a video more finely, which can be helpful with editing. Users also have the option to clear their Recently Viewed and Recently Shared album history, and Favorites will appear in the Utility and Pinned Collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther updates\n\nApple's Mail app is getting an AI makeover that will categorize emails based on their priority level. The update will give access to the \"digest\" view, which organizes all emails from a sender in one place.\n\nApple's internet browser Safari should also receive some changes, including new customizable background images for the start page.\n\nApple is also expected to introduce Image Wand, a new tool for the iPad that turns sketches and written notes into images in the Notes app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple is also releasing some bug fixes and improvements with iOS 18.2, including a Podcast update that allows users to choose their favorite categories and get relevant recommendations in their library."

During various parts of the investigation it is claimed a disembodied figured told them to eat s**t while another seemed to direct them to a grave.\n\nGloucester Paranormal Investigation Services is run by lead investigators Paul Cowmeadow, 48, and Ed Francis, 51, who are both from Gloucester. They are the best of friends and share an interest in the paranormal and held their first investigation at the Rose Garden in Matson in 2018, and have continued on a quest to find conclusive proof of other worldly beings in different locations across the county.\n\nPaul and Ed had previously tried to investigate the former mental health facility and 'abandoned graveyard' in Horton Road, Gloucester, yet due to poor weather they had to abandon their plans. They have said an entity at the investigation recognised the pair from the previous stake-out, and said 'nice to see you'.\n\nREAD MORE: Mystery as crocheter's Christmas creation turns up a year after it was stolen\n\nREAD MORE: 'Shock' for carers and families as 'lifeline' service to end\n\nThe investigation took place mid October and was recorded during a Facebook live stream and paranormal fans were able to join and watch the spooky goings on for themselves.\n\nPaul said: \"The most recent investigation we carried out took place at an abandoned graveyard on Horton Road opposite where the former Horton Road Hospital was, which was Gloucestershire\u2019s first mental asylum which was open from 1823-1988. This graveyard is said to be part of the hospital and patients from the asylum are believed to be buried there.\n\n\"We briefly tried to investigate it a few years ago but unfortunately the weather wasn\u2019t on our side and we had to leave just when we were starting to make a connection with the spirits there.\"\n\nThe pair arrived to the area around 9.30pm ready to start the live stream at 10pm. The stream drew in fans of the team to watch on as the night's events developed.\n\nStay up to date with the latest on this story and more by signing up to our daily newsletter, delivering our top stories straight to your inbox\n\nEd said: \"This investigation was a bit different from some of our previous investigations as it felt like the spirits there really wanted us to return and communicate with them which makes sense as it is an abandoned graveyard and we were probably the only visitors they had that gave them some attention.\"\n\nPaul said: \"After our first visit there back in 2021 where we had to leave because of bad weather, we felt like we had only just scratched the surface of what spirits were there and definitely felt like the spirits really wanted to communicate with us.\n\n\"This year we were again held back a bit by the weather but as soon as a clear evening was forecast, we seized the opportunity and went back to Horton Road Graveyard to see if we could pick up from where we left off last time.\"\n\nPaul and Ed felt they were going to get responses from other worldly beings from the off. They have documented the highlights of the live video and feel responses they had many intelligent responses from paranormal entities\n\nThe tools of the paranormal investigator in action\n\nFor example, Paul takes a small box out from his bag and the spirits produced the words 'what's that box'. Then Ed explains to the spirits what to do with his digital recorder during a burst EVP session and the spirits produced the words \u201cexplain that device\u201d.\n\nPaul said: \"We use a ball which is a cat toy that lights up when it moves, and while we were talking away the name Thomas comes through on the Alice box, which is a voice generated word device, and the spirits pick and choose what they would like to say. When the name Thomas came through and a cat-eye ball went off, the cat ball actually moved onto a grave with the name Thomas on it which was amazing.\"\n\nEd said: \"This ones quite funny. While moving around the graveyard a spirit asked a question through the Spirit Talker app asking \u201cAm I dead?\u201d We responded by telling them 'yes, you are, sorry' and then the spirit generated two more words for us, 'eat s**t'. We came to the conclusion that it must be a spirit in denial, doesn\u2019t want to believe they are actually dead.\"\n\nThe engagement rom the entities did not stop there. The word 'abandoned came through on the word box and the pair believe this was in reference to the abandoned graveyard where they were investigating.\n\nGloucester Paranormal Investigation Services (G.P.I.S) is run by lead investigators Paul Cowmeadow, 48, and Ed Francis, 51, who are both from Gloucester -Credit:Gloucester Paranormal Investigation Services\n\nPaul said: \"The spirits produced the word 'abandoned' which made us think about how the graveyard is abandoned and nobody takes care of the graves any more causing them to become overgrown and almost invisible in places. Ed started removing some of the ivy and leaves away from a nearby grave making it more visible and the spirits produced the words 'thank you so much' and also said that it was 'nice to see us again'.\"\n\nPaul and Ed have been busy in the paranormal investigation work in recent months and it has taken them into a new realm of television.\n\nEd said: \"It\u2019s been a busy couple of years for us. Last year we were in the Forest of Dean at Littledean Jail filming for a new series called Weird Britain which was featured on Blaze earlier this year and is now being shown on Sky History.\n\n\"We are also involved with three film festivals. The Fortean Film Festival, the Magaflix Movie Awards and the International Celebration of Cinema that are run throughout the year. We\u2019ve appeared as extras in a horror movie and are involved in filming for other documentaries which we cant say too much about at the moment which is always an adventure and a lot of fun.\"\n\nPaul aid: \"Our hopes for the future are to continue on our paranormal journey with the spirits and travel further afield to continue to take their stories to a wider audience through documentaries and media.\""

            "article_content": "Haunting\u2014it's not just for houses any more! We do a quick survey of haunted spots around the world.\n\nWe explore some of Wikipedia\u2019s oddities in our 6,922,857-part monthly series, Wiki Wormhole.\n\nThis week\u2019s entry: List of Reportedly Haunted Locations\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: G-g-g-ghosts! Spooks and specters have been found hanging out everywhere from theme parks to beaches and mountains, as well as your classic cemeteries and abandoned insane asylums. Wikipedia lists haunted places in no less than 45 different countries. (Several countries, including the good ol\u2019 U.S. of Apparitions, have so many haunted locations they have a separate page. For our purposes, we\u2019re going to stick to the main page.)\n\nBiggest controversy: Every supernatural claim is by nature controversial (it should go without saying that the word \u201creportedly\u201d goes before every haunting mentioned here.) But the longest controversy on the list is that of the Chase Vault in Barbados. A sealed burial vault in the cemetery of Christ Church Parish Church, it was opened in the early 19th century for a burial, and the heavy lead coffins had switched positions. While the tale is called \u201chistorically dubious,\u201d it made it into James Edward Alexander\u2019s 1833 book Transatlantic Sketches and the story persists to this day.\n\nStrangest fact: No amount of power or status can keep one\u2019s soul from roaming the night in ghostly torment. Former Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley reportedly haunts the Hotel Kurrajong, where he died in 1951. People have seen him pointing towards Old Parliament House, which is also haunted (although the building\u2019s own Wikipedia page makes no mention.) And the Pharaoh himself haunts the Pyramids of Giza (although which pharaoh isn\u2019t specified).\n\nSeveral former seats of power make the list, including Egypt\u2019s Baron Empain Palace, Myanmar\u2019s Keng Tung palace (now a hotel), Pakistan\u2019s Mohatta Palace, Lisbon\u2019s Beau-S\u00e9jour Palace, Madrid\u2019s Palace Of Linares, and the Jakarta History Museum (formerly the capitol building under Dutch colonial rule).\n\nThing we were happiest to learn: There are a lot of haunted castles. Malahide Castle in north County Dublin (the surrounding town is the shooting location for most of Bad Sisters), has no less than five ghosts: a knight killed on his wedding day, a noblewoman who was married in the castle; a jester who was in love with a woman imprisoned in the castle (who was himself murdered), a painting of a lady in white who occasionally comes to life, and the man who was (temporarily) given the castle by Cromwell, and was hanged during the Restoration.\n\nIreland also accounts for Castles Charleville, Leap, and Ross, each with their own gruesome deaths and subsequent hauntings. Most gruesomely, Zvikov Castle in the Czech Republic is supposedly so haunted that anyone who sleeps in the main tower dies within a year, and spectral dogs with burning eyes guard a tunnel under the castle.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to top Germany which, alongside Lichtenegg, Schloss Nordkirchen, and Wolfsegg, boasts Frankenstein Castle, whose imposing towers allegedly inspired Mary Shelley\u2019s novel (and no less than Ghost Hunters International determined it had \u201csignificant paranormal activity.\u201d\n\nEuropeans even exported the haunted castle overseas. A Scottish businessman built Kellie\u2019s Castle in Malaysia for his wife, who died before building was completed. It\u2019s haunted not by her, but by the workers who died during construction. New Zealand also has Larnach Castle, haunted by the wife and daughter of the original owner.\n\nThing we were unhappiest to learn: Colonialism casts a long shadow. A lot of the haunted sites are the sites of past atrocities by colonial powers: Vietnam\u2019s Ma Thi\u00ean L\u00e3nh Bridge was built by 300 prisoners, forced into labor under French rule, and a number of ghosts haunt the site. Besides the Jakarta History Museum, Indonesia is home to Toko Merah, a Dutch colonial building that was the site of a massacre, as well as torture and killings by the regime, and screaming at night can still be heard there. The Japanese (allegedly) tortured and executed Malaysian locals at what eventually became the Shih Chung Branch School, and the now-abandoned building is haunted by their ghosts.\n\nBest link to elsewhere on Wikipedia: We honestly thought parapsychology was a term made-up for the original Ghostbusters, but it\u2019s been an active discipline since philosopher Max Dessoir coined the phrase in 1889. It\u2019s the study of \u201calleged psychic phenomena,\u201d a list that includes \u201cextrasensory perception, telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, and psychometry,\u201d as well as near-death experiences, synchronicity, and apparitional experiences, and again, it\u2019s hard not to hear that list being read off in Annie Potts\u2019 most jaded tone of voice.\n\nFurther down the Wormhole: These stories are all relatively recent, compared to the folklore surrounding ghosts, which has existed as long as people have been dying and telling stories. Children have long had an entirely separate world of folklore, concerning the consequences of stepping on a crack, and whether or not Batman smells. Their mysterious culture also includes children\u2019s games, which recent generations of adults seem loath to let go of. One such game, pencil fighting, is an unlikely candidate to spawn an adult league, but here we are. There isn\u2019t quite enough in the world of extreme pencil fighting to justify a full-length column, so we\u2019ll wrap up the year with a bunch of short topics before resuming our regular format in 2025."

This compound, N-(2-iodophenyl) methane sulfonamide, has potential pharmacological applications, boosting makhana's value beyond a snack. This discovery could revolutionize the makhana industry, benefiting farmers and potentially impacting global snacking habits.\n\nFunds pending for restoration of school compound walls\n\nMonsoon rains wreaked havoc on 297 government schools in Mangaluru, damaging buildings and boundary walls. While the district administration disbursed Rs 4.6 crore to 244 schools for critical repairs, 53 schools with damaged walls were left without funding. These schools are now tasked with finding alternative resources like MGNREGA to address the remaining repairs, estimated to cost significantly more.\n\nGSFC Universitys lab gets NABL accreditation\n\nGSFC University's chemical instrumentation laboratory in Vadodara has received accreditation from the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) for drinking water quality testing. This prestigious recognition, based on ISO/IEC 17025:2017 standards, covers 19 parameters. The lab's accreditation will significantly boost student learning, research, and the university's mission to produce highly skilled graduates.\n\nBhagalpur: As makhana (fox nut) gains popularity as a healthy snack, scientists at Bihar Agricultural University (BAU), Sabour, have achieved a major breakthrough. They have identified a unique compound, N-(2-iodophenyl) methane sulfonamide, in makhana, which has vital medicinal property.\u201cThis is the first time the bioactive compound has been identified as a naturally occurring component in makhana,\u201d said vice-chancellor (VC) D R Singh. He added that the compound, a sulfonamide derivative of iodobenzene, is known for its pharmacological potential. \u201cThis finding proves the therapeutic potential of makhana and promises to boost its global recognition and market value. It could revolutionise both the makhana industry and global snacking habits,\u201d he said.Singh added the research reflects BAU\u2019s commitment to innovation, uplifting farmers\u2019 economic conditions and positioning Bihar as a hub for cutting-edge agricultural advancements. \u201cThis finding will inspire farmers to combine traditional farming with modern science.\u201dDr Anil Kumar Singh, director of research at BAU, filed a patent for the discovery. He said makhana, traditionally valued as a nutritious food, is now recognised as a bioactive resource with medicinal value. \u201cThis positions makhana as more than just a snack \u2014 it becomes a key player in the nutraceutical industry, attracting interest from pharmaceutical companies and boosting its economic potential,\u201d he said.The research team revealed that makhana is not only rich in nutrients but also has antioxidant and therapeutic properties.Conducted in the university\u2019s NABL-accredited laboratory, the study was led by a team of scientists and faculty members, including V Shajeeda Banu (plant biotechnology), Pritam Ganguly (soil science and agricultural chemistry), Anil Kumar (horticulture) and Dr Anil Kumar Singh (director of research)."

While OpenAI uses user interactions to improve its models, some users may prefer not to have their data contribute to this process. For such users, OpenAI offers an option to opt out of data sharing, allowing them to maintain greater control over their information.\n\nHere's how you can update your settings to stop ChatGPT from using your data for training purposes.\n\nOn the web version\n\nLog in to chatgpt.com Click on your account name or profile icon in the top-right corner of the screen. Select Settings from the dropdown menu. Navigate to Data Controls. Toggle off the option labelled 'Improve the model for everyone'.\n\nThis action ensures that OpenAI no longer uses your conversations with ChatGPT to train or refine its AI models.\n\nOn the ChatGPT mobile app\n\nOpen the ChatGPT app on your device.\n\nFrom the home screen, tap the two-line menu icon at the top-left corner of the screen.\n\nLook at the bottom-left corner, where your account name is displayed, and tap the three dots next to it.\n\nOn the new screen, select Data Controls .\n\n. Toggle off the option 'Improve the model for everyone'.\n\nFrom the same Data Controls menu, you can also manage other aspects of your data.

            "article_content": "India's renowned automotive giant, Mahindra & Mahindra, has found itself in a legal dispute with the country's largest airline, IndiGo, over the name of Mahindra's latest electric SUV, the BE 6e.\n\nWhat Is The Ruckus All About?\n\nMahindra & Mahindra unveiled its latest electric SUVs, the BE 6e and XEV 9e, on November 26, 2024, as part of its \"Born Electric\" portfolio. After the launch, the name of the car caught attention and sparked a dispute with InterGlobe Aviation. Indigo's parent company, Interglobe, raised an objection regarding the name of the new EV car segments, claiming the '6e' in the SUV's name coincides with its trademarked flight code, 6E. The controversy erupted after Interglobe filed a legal appeal against Mahindra's use of the \"BE6e\" as the name of their new automobile, claiming it could affect IndiGo's branding.\n\nMahindra's Response to Indigo's Legal Suit\n\nIn response to that, Mahindra & Mahindra announced on Saturday that it will remove the 'e' from the name of its new electric SUV, the 'BE6e.\n\nIn its media release dated December 7, the company has stated its intention to contest Interglobe's objection in court. The hearing will be conducted in the Delhi High Court, as India Today reported. The auto giant believes there is no conflict between the two brands and intends to seek rights to the \"BE6e\" trademark as part of its electric vehicle portfolio.\n\nThe automaker applied for trademark registration under Class 12 (vehicles) for the BE6e, aligning it with its \"Born Electric\" platform that emphasizes a sustainable future for the automotive industry.\n\nMahindra said,\" We also find it unseemly that two large Indian multinationals should engage in a distracting and unnecessary conflict when in fact we should be championing each other's growth and expansion. We are hence taking the decision to brand our product the \"BE 6.\"\n\nMahindra pointed out a past instance where Tata Motors had raised concerns over InterGlobe using the name \"IndiGo,\" as it closely resembled Tata's \"Indigo\" car brand. Despite Tata Motors' objection, InterGlobe continued to use the name \"IndiGo\" because it was in a completely different industry, i.e., aviation, as compared to Tata's automobile business.\n\nMahindra finds it surprising and inconsistent that InterGlobe is now objecting to the use of \"BE6e\" for their electric SUV, even though the two brands operate in entirely separate industries. Mahindra believes that just as InterGlobe was allowed to retain the \"IndiGo\" name without issue in the past, their use of \"BE6e\" should also be accepted, as it does not create any confusion between the two sectors."

            "article_content": "This article contains predictions for an old game!\n\nPhoto By - Imagn Images. Pictured: Josh Allen looks to throw the football.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills ride a seven-game winning streak into SoFi Stadium to face the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday, December 8 at 4:25 p.m. ET on FOX.\n\nMy Bills vs. Rams predictions and NFL picks are bullish on Buffalo continuing its quest for the No. 1 seed in the AFC and handing Los Angeles a third straight loss.\n\nBills vs Rams predictions\n\nBills vs Rams spread prediction\n\nWhile Buffalo is ripe for a letdown showing and traveling west to SoFi Stadium following consecutive statement home wins over last year\u2019s two Super Bowl finalists, I expect the Bills to continue building momentum and taking down the Rams to push closer toward the No. 1 seed in the AFC on Sunday. Simply put, this will be too much of an uptick in class for a middling Los Angeles roster and quarterback Matthew Stafford.\n\nBills vs Rams moneyline prediction\n\nOne of the biggest reasons the Bills will cover the number is because the Rams lack a legitimate home-field advantage at SoFi Stadium. Expect Buffalo moneylines to be one of the most popular bets and parlay legs of Week 14.\n\nBills vs Rams Over/Under prediction\n\nThis is tied for the highest total of the season for the Bills, and they went Under 49.5 in Week 2. So, even with the Bills sporting an active 5-1-1 run to the Over, I still like the Under on Sunday. After all, Los Angeles failed to go Over the number in all four games with a total of 49 or higher, and Buffalo is in the noted letdown spot.\n\nBills vs Rams best bet\n\nBills -3.5 (-115 at BetMGM)\n\nThe 6-6 Los Angeles Rams are exactly who their record says they are. A middling club on both sides of the ball that\u2019s bouncing on the playoff bubble, and the Rams are receiving too much credit for recent road wins over the New England Patriots and New Orleans Saints.\n\nLos Angeles lacks a real home-field advantage at SoFi Stadium, and the travel shouldn\u2019t have a huge impact on the Buffalo Bills with just a single game since their Week 12 bye.\n\nThe Bills are better on both sides of the ball, and in particular, I value Buffalo scoring on 49.2% (second) of drives and turning 66.7% (fourth) of red-zone trips into touchdowns. Los Angeles respective sports a 20th-ranked 35.5% and 53.5% marks.\n\nOn the flip side, the Rams allow 45.5% (fifth-highest) of drives to result in points, while the Bills allow the eighth-fewest (33.1%).\n\nThe gap in quarterback play is also significant, with Bills quarterback Josh Allen throwing for higher yards per attempt and adjusted completion percentage than Rams QB Matthew Stafford. Of course, Allen also paces the NFL in adjusted EPA per play, while Stafford ranks a middling 19th.\n\nAgain, Buffalo is just too large a step up in class for Los Angeles, and the Bills have covered the number in 14 of their past 22 games.\n\nBills vs Rams same-game parlay\n\nBills -4.5\n\n\n\nUnder 49.5\n\n\n\nTyler Bass Over 1.5 made field goals +400 at BetMGM\n\nAs noted, this is tied for the highest total of the season for the Bills, and they went Under that 49.5 number in Week 2. Additionally, the Rams haven\u2019t gone Over a total of 49 or higher all season.\n\nThis checks out as a traditional tough schedule spot for Buffalo, too. The Bills played the Sunday Night Football game in Week 13, and they\u2019re now hitting the highway to play a game on the West Coast on Sunday.\n\nSo, even with Buffalo cruising along a 5-1-1 run to the Over, I\u2019m anticipating this number proving to be too high.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nNew Users\n\nUp to $1,500 in bonus bet insurance at BetMGM Make your football plays at BetMGM, which is offering new users up to $1,500 in bonus bets (if your first bet doesn't win)!

            "article_content": "At the heart of this cosmic mystery lies the Higgs field, a fundamental component of our universe that gives particles their mass. However, this field isn\u2019t as stable as we once thought. Scientists have discovered that the Higgs field could potentially \u201cbubble,\u201d creating pockets of altered reality where nothing could exist.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher, Lucien Heurtier, explains : \u201cThe Higgs field isn\u2019t likely to be in the lowest possible energy state it could be in. That means it could theoretically change its state, dropping to a lower energy state in a certain location.\u201d\n\nThis revelation has profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos. If the Higgs field were to shift to a lower energy state, it would dramatically alter the laws of physics within these \u201cbubbles.\u201d In such an environment :\n\nElectron masses would suddenly change\n\nParticle interactions would be altered\n\nProtons and neutrons would disintegrate\n\nLife as we know it would cease to exist\n\nThe paradox deepens when we consider the early universe and the hypothetical existence of primordial black holes. These minuscule black holes, potentially as small as a gram, are believed to have formed during the universe\u2019s inflationary period, mere moments after the Big Bang.\n\nPrimordial black holes : the universe\u2019s self-destruct button ?\n\nThe research team argues that if primordial black holes existed as current models suggest, they should have triggered widespread \u201cbubbling\u201d of the Higgs field. This cosmic chain reaction would have prevented the formation of any stable matter in the universe. Yet, here we are, contemplating our own existence.\n\nThis paradox presents scientists with two possible explanations :\n\nOur current models of primordial black holes are incorrect and need to be discarded There are fundamental aspects of the Higgs field\u2019s behavior that we don\u2019t yet understand\n\nThe implications of this study extend far beyond theoretical physics. It challenges our understanding of the universe\u2019s origins and stability, forcing us to reconsider established theories. This paradox is reminiscent of other unexpected discoveries that have baffled astronomers, pushing the boundaries of our cosmic knowledge.\n\nUnraveling the cosmic tapestry : new frontiers in physics\n\nAs scientists grapple with this existential paradox, new avenues of research are emerging. The quest to understand the universe\u2019s existence has led to innovative experiments and theoretical frameworks. One such breakthrough is the quantum cat experiment that set a record by surviving 1,400 seconds, pushing the boundaries of quantum superposition.\n\nThese advancements in quantum physics may hold the key to unraveling the Higgs field mystery. By exploring the behavior of particles at the quantum level, scientists hope to gain insights into the stability of the Higgs field and its interactions with other cosmic phenomena.\n\nThe study of cosmic paradoxes extends beyond the realm of physics. Recent research has even challenged our understanding of what happens in the brain after death, defying all logic. These discoveries highlight the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines and the need for a holistic approach to understanding our universe.\n\nRedefining reality : the impact on scientific thought\n\nThe revelation that the universe shouldn\u2019t exist according to current models has profound implications for scientific thought. It challenges researchers to question established theories and explore new paradigms. This shift in thinking could lead to revolutionary discoveries across various fields, from astrophysics to quantum mechanics.\n\nTo illustrate the potential impact of this paradigm shift, consider the following table :\n\nScientific Field Current Understanding Potential Paradigm Shift Cosmology Big Bang Theory Multi-dimensional universe models Particle Physics Standard Model Unified field theories Quantum Mechanics Copenhagen Interpretation Many-worlds interpretation Astrophysics Dark Matter/Energy Modified gravity theories\n\nAs scientists continue to probe the mysteries of the universe, unexpected discoveries are reshaping our understanding of reality. From new types of materials that could change our lives to fundamental questions about existence itself, the frontiers of science are expanding rapidly.\n\nThe paradox of the universe\u2019s existence serves as a humbling reminder of how much we have yet to learn. It invites us to embrace uncertainty, question our assumptions, and continue exploring the cosmic tapestry that surrounds us. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the Higgs field and primordial black holes, we may uncover truths that reshape our understanding of reality itself."

The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a New Yorker and a staunch believer in public transportation. For most of my life, I never owned a car.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, all the forms of public transportation I used daily were unsafe.\n\nI had to think about how I could transport my then-five-year-old and how I would reach family members if something terrible happened.\n\nI considered getting a car for the first time. I made this list: It was written in Sharpie on a piece of grid paper, and it said, \"New?\" \"Used?\" \"EV???\" However, I had to immediately eliminate electric vehicles from my potential options because, in 2020, there was no accessible place to charge them in Brooklyn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI realized there was a lack of infrastructure to transition to EV cars and that was the seed idea for my company.\n\nAlthough my career was in design, I pivoted and cofounded a climate tech startup called It's Electric in 2022. We're focused on scaling electric vehicle charging in densely populated cities.\n\nWe're now a company of 10 people and we've received $11.8 million in funding and grants. Uber invested in our seed round. My best advice is to find simple solutions to big pain points and prove your work with receipts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe found a simple solution for electric charging\n\nWhen we started building It's Electric in 2021, my cofounder and I conducted research to determine what was preventing EV chargers from being deployed quickly and at scale in US cities.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIn a city like London, there are a lot of lampposts that have been retrofitted into curbside chargers because they can handle 220 to 240 volts of electricity. In the US, the power feeds in our lamposts are typically much lower, at 110 volts.\n\nIf we wanted to have lamppost chargers, we'd need to upgrade the utility main and corresponding interconnection agreement, load analysis, transformer, submeter, and customer connection box.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe discovered that one asset in cities, that has plenty of power ready to go, is buildings, which we can use to power public chargers.\n\nIf a library, home, or commercial building agrees to power a public charger, we share revenue with that building to give them passive income as an incentive. It's a very simple idea. We say it's not deep tech, it's shallow tech.\n\nRunning a pilot helped get investors on board\n\nOur business started with just us two founders, but after we raised a $2.2 million pre-seed round in May 2023, we hired our first two employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring our pre-seed stage, multiple investors told me that our idea was so simple that it must not work, or surely someone else was already doing it. We had to prove that a simple solution could be effective.\n\nOne way we did that was by getting our pilot off the ground in 2023.\n\nWe secured our partnership with Hyundai after winning their EV Open Innovation Challenge. Winners were selected based on their potential to expand market access to electric vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe knew we needed to test in the real world and in a notoriously hard-to-open city. So we approached the New York City Economic Development Corporation to ask if we could pilot our technology on their buildings in the Brooklyn Army Terminal. After much work, this became our first pilot and was crucial to landing investment.\n\nOur work on this pilot was so successful that EDC launched a brand new program based on our pilot.\n\nHave receipts and discuss your wins\n\nOur pilot demonstrated that our solution offsets emissions, and we could collect data from the demo to show it was scalable, low-cost, and quick to install.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pilot meant I could provide investors with proven results. We'd gone beyond what investors expected of us, which placated their queries and also attracted investors we hadn't yet spoken to.\n\nHaving a small-scale demonstration of your solution is more helpful in pitching to a large corporation than trying to sell a concept. It meant we were able to demonstrate a Series A level of progress at a pre-seed level.\n\nSo many investors said, \"If it is so simple and such a good idea, then why aren't others already doing it?\" My answer was, \"Because no one else is doing it, we are the first.\" My advice to founders is to be tenacious but make sure you have the receipts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe talked about our wins, such as prize nominations and media acknowledgments, to show investors that, by the jury of peers, our solution is winning.\n\nUber invested in our seed round\n\nIn July 2024, we closed our $6.5 million seed round, which was co-led by a Nordic fund, Failup Ventures, and Uber. Now, we're a team of 10.\n\nOur involvement with Uber began when we met representatives from the company at a conference. Everyone thinks of companies like Uber as big corporate giants, but we started our partnership with them by chance. It wasn't a sales or business meeting; it was just two optimistic people working in transportation who had a great conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA big challenge to Uber's zero-emissions goal is that Uber drivers live in cities and don't have garages, so it's really hard to charge electric vehicles. We provided a cheap, fast solution for urban drivers to charge electric cars. Uber needed more drivers to adopt electric cars to reach its goals, and we pitched ourselves as that stepping stone. A series of productive conversations helped us build this partnership.\n\nHaving Uber support our solution has been a great validation for our startup. It's also meant we've had access to smart people on their team to understand different policies and how we can help meet city goals.\n\nMy advice for founders who want to develop relationships with established companies is to try to solve problems for other people. Don't say you want a partnership because of what it can do for your startup, but put yourself out there as the problem-solver for a larger corporation. You want to find their pain point and point out that there isn't a solution that's already in the market."

In the past five years, inconsistency has unfortunately been the only consistent trend \u2014 ranging from the removal of promised tax breaks to issues like internet firewalls and virtual private network (VPN) blockage.\n\nThese actions have undermined the confidence of both the local industry and international business leaders who depend on Pakistan for their back-end operations.\n\nVPN restrictions are hindering freelancers and businesses, jeopardising Pakistan\u2019s digital export growth and global competitiveness\n\nIn the business and corporate world, VPNs are used to access corporate networks due to security issues, as these networks cannot be accessed from outside. Many companies give their employees access to their network via VPN as corporate data cannot be shared outside the network due to confidentiality, privacy laws, and data security.\n\nSimilarly, Pakistani visitors are completely blocked and restricted from many international websites, banks, and payment gateways, which see traffic from Pakistan and Pakistani users as a risk. Freelancers and remote workers use VPNs to access these websites and corporate networks.\n\nInternet speed and latency are critical for many business applications. Online meetings are key to customer interaction and sales. Many businesses call customers to sell their products and services and to provide customer support. Many of these customers are earned after multiple calls, meetings, and the development of trust, as it is much more difficult to sell remotely.\n\nLocal businesses have products, services, and e-commerce websites where, instead of providing services to others, they create their own brands and sell globally and locally. In the digital era, brand building is about utilising social media to reach your customers.\n\nThis is also an opportunity for Pakistanis to reach global audiences, which was previously impossible when using traditional media abroad. These brands are critical to building our economy as we have to move from a services country to a product country in the long run.\n\nDisruption to social media is causing issues for these businesses as their customers are facing issues using social media. Many companies which only sell abroad to customers using social media are also facing problems as they are getting blocked. Local e-commerce businesses are also getting affected.\n\nThe only way to access VPN is now limited to getting whitelisted, where the process is extremely slow, difficult, and impossible for many small businesses as they are not registered with the Pakistan Software Export Board, which is a key requirement for registration.\n\nWith over 0.6m tech workers in Pakistan, our authorities are approving around 200 applications per day. This is concerning for the industry where work is extremely fast. VPNs are blocked anytime without notice, and the internet slows down unannounced.\n\nOur policymakers and implementers need to understand that we cannot go on like this as a nation. With a current growth rate of 25pc per year in information technology exports, we are targeted to grow our exports to more than $9 billion, and that\u2019s without any intervention from the government. We should consider increasing the growth rate to 30pc or even 40pc.\n\nWe need to understand that this pillar of the economy is critical to our future. These digital workers are becoming pessimistic because of the approach and how things are being implemented. This young tech talent is highly sought after by countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Japan, where recruiters from these countries are poaching our talent to fuel their digital economy plans.\n\nTo ensure Pakistan\u2019s continued growth, immediate and decisive actions and leadership are needed. Policymakers must prioritise a stable regulatory environment, and implementers should be very careful in ensuring ease of business, uninterrupted internet connectivity, and digital infrastructure growth with our increasing needs. Collaboration and private sector involvement in preparing these plans are key to driving growth for our technology sector.\n\nThe writer is a former chairman of the Pakistan Software Houses Association for IT and ITeS\n\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, December 9th, 2024"

This not only reduces the risk of defects but also enhances overall production efficiency, making it ideal for high-volume manufacturing.\n\nAI\u2019s impact extends beyond the welding process itself. Predictive maintenance powered by machine learning helps anticipate equipment failures, reducing downtime and improving the longevity of welding machines. By continually learning from historical data, AI ensures that welding operations run smoothly and cost-effectively, particularly in high-stakes automotive applications.\n\n2. Digital Twins\n\nA digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical system or process. In welding, digital twins are used to simulate and optimize welding techniques before they are implemented in production. Manufacturers can test different parameters, materials, and welding methods virtually, ensuring that the final product meets quality standards without the risk of trial and error on the production floor. This leads to better resource utilization, faster development cycles, and reduced waste.\n\nDigital twins also enable manufacturers to monitor the performance of welding machines in real time, allowing for continuous improvements and adjustments to maintain high-quality standards. This innovation is particularly valuable in the automotive industry, where precision and consistency are crucial.\n\n3. Augmented Reality (AR) for Training and Assistance\n\nWelding requires high levels of skill, and training new welders can be both time-consuming and costly. Augmented reality (AR) has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance training programs by providing immersive, hands-on learning experiences. AR tools can overlay digital instructions on the physical workspace, guiding trainees step by step through the welding process. This can improve safety, reduce errors, and accelerate the learning curve for novice welders.\n\nIn addition to training, AR is used in the automotive industry for real-time assistance during the welding process. Workers equipped with AR headsets can receive on-the-job guidance, improving accuracy and reducing mistakes. AR can also be used for remote support, allowing experts to provide assistance from a distance, which is especially beneficial in complex or hazardous tasks.\n\n4. Sustainability Innovations\n\nAs environmental concerns grow, sustainability has become a key focus in the automotive industry, and welding technology is no exception. New welding techniques, such as cold metal transfer (CMT) and other low-energy processes, are helping to reduce energy consumption while still delivering high-quality welds. These processes minimize heat input, which not only reduces energy use but also prevents material distortion, leading to higher quality and less waste.\n\nAdditionally, innovations in welding materials and processes are helping to reduce the environmental impact of automotive manufacturing. For instance, more sustainable welding wires, eco-friendly shielding gases, and recyclable welding consumables are being developed to minimize the carbon footprint of the welding process. As the industry moves toward electric vehicles (EVs) and greener manufacturing practices, sustainable welding technologies will play a key role in achieving these goals.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe integration of AI, machine learning, digital twins, augmented reality, and sustainable welding practices marks a new era for the automotive industry. These advanced technologies not only enhance the quality and efficiency of welding but also contribute to the overall evolution of the manufacturing process.

After taking much of Aleppo, its fighters moved on to the next front line, leaving the city to technocrats who came to preserve government institutions, Mr. al-Jolani said. His group said that public institutions would remain under the oversight of the country\u2019s prime minister until there was a transition.\n\nAn enduring conflict\n\nThe Syrian war began in 2011 with a peaceful uprising against the government and spiraled into a complex conflict involving armed rebels, extremists and others.\n\nThe origins: The conflict started when Syrians rose up peacefully against the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The protests were met with a violent crackdown, while communities took up arms to defend themselves. Civil war ensued.\n\nOther groups became involved. Amid the chaos, Syria\u2019s ethnic Kurdish minority took up arms and gradually took territory it saw as its own. The Islamic State seized parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014 and declared that territory its \u201ccaliphate,\u201d further destabilizing the region."

Some analysts say that predicting what comes next is made more challenging because the government\u2019s sudden demise took many people who have watched the region for years by surprise.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to bring process and a smooth transition to a fast-moving situation,\u201d said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, a research institute in London. \u201cThe speed and uncertainty poses many risks for what comes next pertaining to accountability and good governance to protect the interests of the Syrian people.\u201d\n\nMr. al-Assad ruled Syria for nearly a quarter of a century, presiding over the suppression of an uprising by civilians and a rebellion that began in 2011. In the ensuing war, more than half a million Syrians died, including 200,000 civilians, according to human rights groups. Millions of people fled the country."

            "article_content": "As Hemingway once wrote of bankruptcy, the collapse of autocratic regimes tends to happen gradually and then suddenly\u2014slowly, and then all at once. This is not just a literary metaphor. A tyrant\u2019s followers remain loyal to him only as long as he can offer them protection from their compatriots\u2019 wrath. In Syria, doubts about President Bashar al-Assad surely grew slowly, after his Russian backers began to transfer men and equipment to Ukraine, starting in 2022. The more recent Israeli attack on Hezbollah\u2019s leadership hampered Iran, Assad\u2019s other ally, from helping him as well.\n\nThen, after a well-organized, highly motivated set of armed opponents took the city of Aleppo on November 29, many of the regime\u2019s defenders abruptly stopped fighting. Assad vanished. The scenes that followed today in Damascus\u2014the toppling of statues, the people taking selfies at the dictator\u2019s palace\u2014are the same ones that will unfold in Caracas, Tehran, or Moscow on the day the soldiers of those regimes lose their faith in the leadership, and the public loses their fear of those soldiers too.\n\nThe similarities among these places are real, because Russia, Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, and, until now, Syria all belong to an informal network of autocracies. Russian troops and mercenaries have spent the past decade fighting in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Africa. Russian political and information operations actively seek to undermine, dominate, or overthrow democratic governments in Moldova, Georgia, and most recently Romania. Starting in 2015, Russian troops propped up Assad in partnership with Iran and Iran\u2019s proxy Hezbollah. In Ukraine, Russia\u2019s war is made possible by drones from Iran, soldiers and ammunition from North Korea, and covert help from China. Russia, Iran, Cuba, and China collaborate to keep in power a regime in Venezuela that has catastrophically failed its people too.\n\nRead: The folly of ignoring Syria this long\n\nMany of these are military conflicts, but Russian President Vladimir Putin also believes that he is fighting a war of ideas, and he has persuaded others to follow him. In both Syria and occupied Ukraine, Russia has deliberately backed or created regimes that have not merely sought to repress opponents but have also gone out of their way to demonstrate flagrant disregard for human rights and the rule of law, ideas that Putin claims belong to the past. When Putin talks about a new world order or a \u201cmultipolar world,\u201d as he did again last month, this is what he means: He wants to build a world in which his cruelty cannot be limited, in which he and his fellow dictators enjoy impunity, and in which no universal values exist, not even as aspirations.\n\nThe results are stark. Since 2011, the Syrian Network for Human Rights has documented more than 112,000 disappearances\u2014men, women, and children arbitrarily arrested and imprisoned with no formal or legal justification. The regime has tortured tens of thousands of people in brutal prisons, keeping them in the dark, forbidding them any contact with the outside world. Infamously, Assad used poison gas against his own people and then lied about it. Joint Russian and Syrian-government air strikes deliberately targeted hospitals and practiced \u201cdouble tap\u201d strikes, bombing a civilian target and then hitting the same location soon afterward to kill rescue workers.\n\nThe Russian war against Ukraine has been equally cruel and equally lawless, in many instances copying tactics used in Syria. In occupied Ukraine, thousands of mayors, local leaders, teachers, and cultural figures have also disappeared into invisible custody. The former mayor of Kherson, abducted in June 2022, is reportedly being held in an illegal prison in Crimea; the mayor of Dniprorudne recently died in custody. In the rest of Ukraine, Russia deliberately targets hospitals and other civilian infrastructure, just as Russian and Syrian government planes did in Syria. Double-tap strikes are common in Ukraine too.\n\nRead: Syria\u2019s new Assad statues send a sinister message: \u2018We are back\u2019\n\nThis kind of cold, deliberate, well-planned cruelty has a logic to it: Brutality is meant to inspire hopelessness. Ludicrous lies and cynical propaganda campaigns are meant to create apathy and nihilism. Random arrests have driven millions of Syrians, Ukrainians, and Venezuelans abroad, creating large, destabilizing waves of refugees and leaving those who remain in despair. The despair, again, is part of the plan. These regimes want to rob people of any ability to plan for a different future, to convince people that their dictatorships are eternal. \u201cOur leader forever\u201d was the Assad dynasty\u2019s slogan.\n\nBut all such \u201ceternal\u201d regimes have one fatal flaw: Soldiers and police officers are members of the public too. They have relatives who suffer, cousins and friends who experience political repression and the effects of economic collapse. They, too, have doubts, and they, too, can become insecure. In Syria, we have just seen the result.\n\nRead: When justice is out of reach\n\nI don\u2019t know whether today\u2019s events will bring peace and stability to Syria, let alone freedom and democracy. A group calling itself the National Transitional Government has reportedly issued a statement asking Syrians to \u201cunite and stand together,\u201d to \u201crebuild the state and its institutions,\u201d and to begin a \u201ccomprehensive national reconciliation,\u201d including the return of all refugees. The leaders of the rebel armies include Islamic extremists; in an interview with CNN, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the leader of the largest group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, described his past affiliation with al-Qaeda as a kind of youthful mistake. This might be tactical language, or propaganda, or unimportant. As I am writing, Syrians in Damascus are looting the presidential palace.\n\nNevertheless, the end of the Assad regime creates something new, and not only in Syria. There is nothing worse than hopelessness, nothing more soul-destroying than pessimism, grief, and despair. The fall of a Russian- and Iranian-backed regime offers, suddenly, the possibility of change. The future might be different. And that possibility will inspire hope all around the world."

            "article_content": "Bryn Davies, CEO of InfoBluePrint.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and cloud are top trends impacting master data management (MDM) now and into the year ahead, as organisations turn their attention to data quality and management to support areas such as digital transformation and analytics.\n\nWhile AI and cloud are certainly noteworthy trends in MDM, my advice \u2212 as always \u2212 is to ensure there's a solid business case for MDM as a first priority.\n\nMore South African organisations have turned their attention to getting data management right as a foundation for analytics and data science.\n\nReliable analytics is a solid business objective, but MDM is not just about analytics, it's also about operational efficiencies: helping you \u2018make more money, spend less money, or stay out of jail\u2019. It's about raising revenues, cutting costs and compliance.\n\nAI may not yet have transformed MDM, but there\u2019s a great deal of interest and a lot of progress being made in deploying AI to improve data governance, metadata management and MDM.\n\nThe application of AI to MDM is a natural progression that will accelerate rapidly in the short-term, and significantly enhance the value and efficiencies of MDM in organisations.\n\nReliable analytics is a solid business objective, but MDM is not just about analytics, it's also about operational efficiencies\n\nAs data volumes continue to grow and data sources become more and more diverse, organisations will find that traditional and manually configured MDM approaches are no longer sufficient to meet their rapidly-evolving data management needs.\n\nThis will require the evolution of MDM to include augmentation through AI and ML, and there are many aspects of MDM that can benefit from this.\n\nAs an example, automated identification of data elements based on actual content, and then instant application of pre-configured data quality validation and remediation rules pertaining to that data, without human developers first having to profile data and then manually map rules.\n\nIn addition to this, such AI algorithms continuously learn and improve, thus automatically reducing errors and enhancing overall data quality on a continuous improvement basis.\n\nAnother example of AI application to MDM would be the replacement of static and rigid data governance processes with adaptive governance frameworks that automatically evolve with changing needs. Overall, AI-driven MDM promises to be a powerful solution to modern data management challenges.\n\nCloud-based MDM has all the benefits of cloud models for other applications, such as rapid deployment, improved scalability, lower costs associated with on-premises IT infrastructure and operations, and improved disaster recovery, to name a few.\n\nOther benefits provided specifically by cloud-based MDM could be the enablement of easier and greater collaboration across larger audiences (human or machine) spread over multiple divisions, organisations, geographic regions, industries or a combination thereof, together with the required seamless scalability that such complexity would demand.\n\nAdditionally, data governance for global organisations could be significantly enhanced by cloud-based MDM, as well as reference data management for such organisations, provided, for example, by a hierarchical MDM architecture supporting global, regional and local master and reference data management schemes.\n\nOf course, whether it is practical to have a cloud-based MDM solution with data provider or consumer applications on-premises, in the cloud or a combination of both, would require well-considered architectural frameworks and thorough piloting, in particular around the inherent data integration requirements of MDM.\n\nAnother trend highlighted by some international industry stakeholders is data fabric architecture to provide a unified view of data across different systems and sources. This has been spoken about for some years, but is only now really starting to be considered seriously by some South African companies.\n\nAs organisations continue to explore the application of data fabric to their analytics, reporting and associated data integration needs, the question that arises is where MDM fits into a data fabric strategy, or vice versa.\n\nIt must be noted that, while there is some overlap between data fabric and MDM, they are different, sometimes subtly, in many regards. Both share a common theme of the need to share data, but the scope of data fabric is all data, while that of MDM is generally master data, and often also reference data.\n\nData fabric has a strong data integration focus, while integration for MDM is more a means to an end, with MDM having a stronger focus on data quality and a persisted, standardised best of breed system-of-record, than what data fabric has.\n\nUltimately, data fabric benefits from MDM being a supplier of harmonised, quality, master (and reference) data, enabling fabric to deliver improved reliability and much greater value when combined with other data, such as transactional data, from multiple sources. Therefore, a move to data fabric may turn more of a spotlight on MDM in future."

            "article_content": "We have only one example of biology forming in the universe \u2013 life on Earth. But what if life can form in other ways? How do you look for alien life when you don\u2019t know what alien life might look like?\n\nThese questions are preoccupying astrobiologists, who are scientists who look for life beyond Earth. Astrobiologists have attempted to come up with universal rules that govern the emergence of complex physical and biological systems both on Earth and beyond.\n\nI\u2019m an astronomer who has written extensively about astrobiology. Through my research, I\u2019ve learned that the most abundant form of extraterrestrial life is likely to be microbial since single cells can form more readily than large organisms. But just in case there\u2019s advanced alien life out there, I\u2019m on the international advisory council for the group designing messages to send to those civilizations.\n\nDetecting life beyond Earth\n\nSince the first discovery of an exoplanet in 1995, over 5,000 exoplanets, or planets orbiting other stars, have been found.\n\nMany of these exoplanets are small and rocky, like Earth, and in the habitable zones of their stars. The habitable zone is the range of distances between the surface of a planet and the star it orbits that would allow the planet to have liquid water, and thus support life as we on Earth know it.\n\nThe sample of exoplanets detected so far projects 300 million potential biological experiments in our galaxy \u2013 or 300 million places, including exoplanets and other bodies such as moons, with suitable conditions for biology to arise.\n\nThe uncertainty for researchers starts with the definition of life. It feels like defining life should be easy, since we know life when we see it, whether it\u2019s a flying bird or a microbe moving in a drop of water. But scientists don\u2019t agree on a definition, and some think a comprehensive definition might not be possible.\n\nNASA defines life as a \u201cself-sustaining chemical reaction capable of Darwinian evolution.\u201d That means organisms with a complex chemical system that evolve by adapting to their environment. Darwinian evolution says that the survival of an organism depends on its fitness in its environment.\n\nThe evolution of life on Earth has progressed over billions of years from single-celled organisms to large animals and other species, including humans.\n\nExoplanets are remote and hundreds of millions of times fainter than their parent stars, so studying them is challenging. Astronomers can inspect the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets using a method called spectroscopy to look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nSpectroscopy might detect signatures of oxygen in a planet\u2019s atmosphere, which microbes called blue-green algae created by photosynthesis on Earth several billion years ago, or chlorophyll signatures, which indicate plant life.\n\nNASA\u2019s definition of life leads to some important but unanswered questions. Is Darwinian evolution universal? What chemical reactions can lead to biology off Earth?\n\nEvolution and complexity\n\nAll life on Earth, from a fungal spore to a blue whale, evolved from a microbial last common ancestor about 4 billion years ago.\n\nThe same chemical processes are seen in all living organisms on Earth, and those processes might be universal. They also may be radically different elsewhere.\n\nIn October 2024, a diverse group of scientists gathered to think outside the box on evolution. They wanted to step back and explore what sort of processes created order in the universe \u2013 biological or not \u2013 to figure out how to study the emergence of life totally unlike life on Earth.\n\nTwo researchers present argued that complex systems of chemicals or minerals, when in environments that allow some configurations to persist better than others, evolve to store larger amounts of information. As time goes by, the system will grow more diverse and complex, gaining the functions needed for survival, through a kind of natural selection.\n\nThey speculated that there might be a law to describe the evolution of a wide variety of physical systems. Biological evolution through natural selection would be just one example of this broader law.\n\nIn biology, information refers to the instructions stored in the sequence of nucleotides on a DNA molecule, which collectively make up an organism\u2019s genome and dictate what the organism looks like and how it functions.\n\nIf you define complexity in terms of information theory, natural selection will cause a genome to grow more complex as it stores more information about its environment.\n\nComplexity might be useful in measuring the boundary between life and nonlife.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s wrong to conclude that animals are more complex than microbes. Biological information increases with genome size, but evolutionary information density drops. Evolutionary information density is the fraction of functional genes within the genome, or the fraction of the total genetic material that expresses fitness for the environment.\n\nOrganisms that people think of as primitive, such as bacteria, have genomes with high information density and so appear better designed than the genomes of plants or animals.\n\nA universal theory of life is still elusive. Such a theory would include the concepts of complexity and information storage, but it would not be tied to DNA or the particular kinds of cells we find in terrestrial biology.\n\nImplications for the search for extraterrestrial life\n\nResearchers have explored alternatives to terrestrial biochemistry. All known living organisms, from bacteria to humans, contain water, and it is a solvent that is essential for life on Earth. A solvent is a liquid medium that facilitates chemical reactions from which life could emerge. But life could potentially emerge from other solvents, too.\n\nAstrobiologists Willam Bains and Sara Seager have explored thousands of molecules that might be associated with life. Plausible solvents include sulfuric acid, ammonia, liquid carbon dioxide and even liquid sulfur.\n\nAlien life might not be based on carbon, which forms the backbone of all life\u2019s essential molecules \u2013 at least here on Earth. It might not even need a planet to survive.\n\nAdvanced forms of life on alien planets could be so strange that they\u2019re unrecognizable. As astrobiologists try to detect life off Earth, they\u2019ll need to be creative.\n\nOne strategy is to measure mineral signatures on the rocky surfaces of exoplanets, since mineral diversity tracks terrestrial biological evolution. As life evolved on Earth, it used and created minerals for exoskeletons and habitats. The hundred minerals present when life first formed have grown to about 5,000 today.\n\nRead More: NASA report finds no evidence that UFOs are extraterrestrial\n\nFor example, zircons are simple silicate crystals that date back to the time before life started. A zircon found in Australia is the oldest known piece of Earth\u2019s crust. But other minerals, such as apatite, a complex calcium phosphate mineral, are created by biology. Apatite is a primary ingredient in bones, teeth and fish scales.\n\nAnother strategy to finding life unlike that on Earth is to detect evidence of a civilization, such as artificial lights, or the industrial pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. These are examples of tracers of intelligent life called technosignatures.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how and when a first detection of life beyond Earth will happen. It might be within the solar system, or by sniffing exoplanet atmospheres, or by detecting artificial radio signals from a distant civilization.\n\nThe search is a twisting road, not a straightforward path. And that\u2019s for life as we know it \u2013 for life as we don\u2019t know it, all bets are off."

            "article_content": "At the heart of this cosmic mystery lies the Higgs field, a fundamental component of our universe that gives particles their mass. However, this field isn\u2019t as stable as we once thought. Scientists have discovered that the Higgs field could potentially \u201cbubble,\u201d creating pockets of altered reality where nothing could exist.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher, Lucien Heurtier, explains : \u201cThe Higgs field isn\u2019t likely to be in the lowest possible energy state it could be in. That means it could theoretically change its state, dropping to a lower energy state in a certain location.\u201d\n\nThis revelation has profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos. If the Higgs field were to shift to a lower energy state, it would dramatically alter the laws of physics within these \u201cbubbles.\u201d In such an environment :\n\nElectron masses would suddenly change\n\nParticle interactions would be altered\n\nProtons and neutrons would disintegrate\n\nLife as we know it would cease to exist\n\nThe paradox deepens when we consider the early universe and the hypothetical existence of primordial black holes. These minuscule black holes, potentially as small as a gram, are believed to have formed during the universe\u2019s inflationary period, mere moments after the Big Bang.\n\nPrimordial black holes : the universe\u2019s self-destruct button ?\n\nThe research team argues that if primordial black holes existed as current models suggest, they should have triggered widespread \u201cbubbling\u201d of the Higgs field. This cosmic chain reaction would have prevented the formation of any stable matter in the universe. Yet, here we are, contemplating our own existence.\n\nThis paradox presents scientists with two possible explanations :\n\nOur current models of primordial black holes are incorrect and need to be discarded There are fundamental aspects of the Higgs field\u2019s behavior that we don\u2019t yet understand\n\nThe implications of this study extend far beyond theoretical physics. It challenges our understanding of the universe\u2019s origins and stability, forcing us to reconsider established theories. This paradox is reminiscent of other unexpected discoveries that have baffled astronomers, pushing the boundaries of our cosmic knowledge.\n\nUnraveling the cosmic tapestry : new frontiers in physics\n\nAs scientists grapple with this existential paradox, new avenues of research are emerging. The quest to understand the universe\u2019s existence has led to innovative experiments and theoretical frameworks. One such breakthrough is the quantum cat experiment that set a record by surviving 1,400 seconds, pushing the boundaries of quantum superposition.\n\nThese advancements in quantum physics may hold the key to unraveling the Higgs field mystery. By exploring the behavior of particles at the quantum level, scientists hope to gain insights into the stability of the Higgs field and its interactions with other cosmic phenomena.\n\nThe study of cosmic paradoxes extends beyond the realm of physics. Recent research has even challenged our understanding of what happens in the brain after death, defying all logic.

            "article_content": "At the heart of this cosmic mystery lies the Higgs field, a fundamental component of our universe that gives particles their mass. However, this field isn\u2019t as stable as we once thought. Scientists have discovered that the Higgs field could potentially \u201cbubble,\u201d creating pockets of altered reality where nothing could exist.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead researcher, Lucien Heurtier, explains : \u201cThe Higgs field isn\u2019t likely to be in the lowest possible energy state it could be in. That means it could theoretically change its state, dropping to a lower energy state in a certain location.\u201d\n\nThis revelation has profound implications for our understanding of the cosmos. If the Higgs field were to shift to a lower energy state, it would dramatically alter the laws of physics within these \u201cbubbles.\u201d In such an environment :\n\nElectron masses would suddenly change\n\nParticle interactions would be altered\n\nProtons and neutrons would disintegrate\n\nLife as we know it would cease to exist\n\nThe paradox deepens when we consider the early universe and the hypothetical existence of primordial black holes. These minuscule black holes, potentially as small as a gram, are believed to have formed during the universe\u2019s inflationary period, mere moments after the Big Bang.\n\nPrimordial black holes : the universe\u2019s self-destruct button ?\n\nThe research team argues that if primordial black holes existed as current models suggest, they should have triggered widespread \u201cbubbling\u201d of the Higgs field. This cosmic chain reaction would have prevented the formation of any stable matter in the universe. Yet, here we are, contemplating our own existence.\n\nThis paradox presents scientists with two possible explanations :\n\nOur current models of primordial black holes are incorrect and need to be discarded There are fundamental aspects of the Higgs field\u2019s behavior that we don\u2019t yet understand\n\nThe implications of this study extend far beyond theoretical physics. It challenges our understanding of the universe\u2019s origins and stability, forcing us to reconsider established theories. This paradox is reminiscent of other unexpected discoveries that have baffled astronomers, pushing the boundaries of our cosmic knowledge.\n\nUnraveling the cosmic tapestry : new frontiers in physics\n\nAs scientists grapple with this existential paradox, new avenues of research are emerging. The quest to understand the universe\u2019s existence has led to innovative experiments and theoretical frameworks. One such breakthrough is the quantum cat experiment that set a record by surviving 1,400 seconds, pushing the boundaries of quantum superposition.\n\nThese advancements in quantum physics may hold the key to unraveling the Higgs field mystery. By exploring the behavior of particles at the quantum level, scientists hope to gain insights into the stability of the Higgs field and its interactions with other cosmic phenomena.\n\nThe study of cosmic paradoxes extends beyond the realm of physics. Recent research has even challenged our understanding of what happens in the brain after death, defying all logic. These discoveries highlight the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines and the need for a holistic approach to understanding our universe.\n\nRedefining reality : the impact on scientific thought\n\nThe revelation that the universe shouldn\u2019t exist according to current models has profound implications for scientific thought.

            "article_content": "1\n\n2\n\nBhubaneswar: Chicago-based IT entrepreneur Nihar Rout has tied up with six schools in Balasore's Soro block to include them in Young Tinker projects in order to inculcate interest in children for STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).\"It's my way of giving back to my native place,\" said Nihar, a mechanical engineer from University College of Engineering, Burla (now VSSUT).Under the Young Tinker Foundation, two vehicles called \u2018 Tinker on Wheels ' (ToW) are visiting the schools since Nov 25, in which models help children understand advanced topics like AI and robotics apart from basic STEM concepts. ToW, which is a part of the foundation set up by Anil Pradhan, a civil engineer, currently operates in Odisha and Telangana.\"Once children are exposed to advanced topics, only then will they be able to think big,\" feels Nihar, who said there were no such facilities in his childhood.Among the practical projects exposing rural children to science are satellite launch, 3D printing and town planning, among others. At least 1,200 students from Satyananda High School, Radhanath Bidyapith, Radhanath ME School, all in Soro, Maudamani High School and Banka Bihari Nodal ME School in Barahapur, and Gopinath High School, Kudei. \"The project was easy to implement as we got a cluster of schools within a 5-km radius,\" said Nihar.For the children, the vehicles are a big attraction as they are being taught in stages. \"First, we had an introductory class and teachers in the vehicle explained about electricity and cleared our doubts,\" said Archana Jena, a Class IX student of Gopinath Govt High School.In-charge headmistress, Laxmi Kumari Agarwal, said children don't have to memorise science concepts as the teachers on the vehicles are explaining it to them. \"Also, the school does not have to spend on such infrastructure. Children are happy that they are getting practical knowledge, and many want to participate,\" said Agarwal.A finale will be held later this month in which children will demonstrate a science project made by them. \"After coming to know about the tinker vehicles, more schools in the locality want to participate. I am planning to expand the initiative before the finale,\" said Nihar."

But in one respect, Tuesday\u2019s iconic celebration of intellectual achievement will be different from previous years.\n\nFor the first time, four Nobel laureates, including Canada\u2019s Geoffrey Hinton, are being honoured for work directly related to artificial intelligence.\n\nIf anyone still needed a sign that AI has arrived, here it is. The technology that is transforming how we work, learn and communicate has ascended to the highest level of scientific acclaim.\n\nAnd the world is celebrating \u2013 albeit with worried glances.\n\nThe ambivalence was evident on Saturday when Dr. Hinton, who is a co-winner of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize in physics, spoke with reporters alongside winners of the chemistry and economics prizes.\n\nThe first question \u2013 put solely to Dr. Hinton \u2013 was whether he regretted his achievement.\n\nDr. Hinton, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto who has been called \u201cthe godfather of AI\u201d explained that he has no sense of having done anything wrong in helping to lay the foundations of today\u2019s AI revolution more than 40 years ago because the consequences of his research were unknown, and would be for decades.\n\nHowever, he added, AI is now developing so much faster than anticipated that some of those consequences have become a serious concern. At this rate, he said, we may be within five to 20 years of witnessing the birth of a \u201csuperintelligence,\u201d an AI that can out-think humans.\n\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d thought about safety earlier,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Hinton is well known for voicing his reservations about AI, which caused him to depart a position with Google in 2023. When his Nobel was announced in October, he told The Globe and Mail that he hoped the award would give him a bigger platform for talking about the risks of AI.\n\nThat has certainly come to pass.\n\nThis week, Dr. Hinton is commanding more than the usual amount of attention for a Nobel laureate in a city that is filled with them. In addition to being the focus of news conferences and panels, his every step is followed by a film crew shooting a documentary about his life. The irony is that Dr. Hinton is associated with a technical leap so profound it has been compared at various times to fire or the Industrial Revolution, but its use could ultimately threaten social stability and perhaps humanity itself.\n\nCanada has had Nobel laureates before, but never quite like this.\n\nFor Dr. Hinton, it\u2019s a world away from the 1980s, when he first began working on neural networks \u2013 the interconnected programming structures that are the heart of today\u2019s learning algorithm. At the time, he was drawing on earlier research at the intersection of physics, computer science and neuroscience, most notably by fellow physics prize winner, John Hopfield of Princeton University. But he could barely have imagined then how far neural networks would come, or what they would achieve in his own lifetime.\n\nTo put things in perspective, Dr. Hinton added that the advances he was part of would certainly have been made by others in his absence. \u201cI think that if I had not done that research, maybe it would delay what\u2019s happening now by a few weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nThat may be true. But in this universe, it is Dr. Hinton who finds himself in the role of prophet and guide, explaining why society must work to ensure that AI is developed for \u201cthe greatest benefit to humankind,\u201d as Alfred Nobel put in the directions for his prize.\n\nExactly how that is to be achieved is not so clear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated question,\u201d said Demis Hassabis, chief of DeepMind Technologies, and co-winner of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Chemistry. \u201dI think it\u2019s not just a technology question, but it\u2019s something the international community needs to come together on.\u201d\n\nThe challenge is that AI is a \u201cdual purpose technology,\u201d he said. It causes harm as easily as it can improve human life.\n\nIt is the former possibility that brought this year\u2019s economics laureates into the discussion, including Daron Acemoglu, an MIT professor whose Nobel-winning work is focused on how societal institutions can lead to drastically different outcomes for economies and for people. A key feature of societies that do better is inclusiveness, something that AI may undermine because its benefits are uneven.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery: From left to right, Secretary General of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Hans Ellegren, laureates of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences 2024 in Memory of Alfred Nobel Turkish-American Daron Acemoglu, British-Americans Simon Johnson and James Robinson, laureates of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry David Baker, Demis Hassabis and John M Jumper and laureate of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics Canadian-British computer scientist and cognitive psychologist Geoffrey E Hinton.JONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cAI promises to be a disruptive change for good and bad, so there is a danger that it will actually widen a lot of gaps,\u201d Dr. Acemoglu said.\n\nIn the good column, scientists have conveyed genuine excitement about the use of AI in research.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re on the cusp of a new golden era of discovery that\u2019s helped by and powered by some of these tools,\u201d Dr. Hassabis said.\n\nHis own Nobel offers such an example. Together with colleague Jonathan Jumper he is receiving a share of the chemistry prize for developing AlphaFold2, an algorithm based on the same kinds of neural networks developed by Dr. Hinton that can predict the structure of a protein based on its genetic sequence. It is a key step toward developing therapies that act on proteins to prevent disease.\n\nIn particular, Dr. Jumper, who is collecting his Nobel before turning 40 next year, exemplifies a generation of researchers who are now looking to use AI to best effect.\n\nAlthough they will share the same stage this week, more than half a century separates him from Dr. Hopfield, who on Sunday called the mystery of how the mind emerges from the brain \u201cthe deepest question posed by our humanity.\u201d\n\nBetween them stands Dr. Hinton, both a participant and witness to the dizzying acceleration that AI has undergone.\n\nThis week may end with tuxedos back in their closets. But if Canada\u2019s latest Nobel laureate is right, a nascent presence that could be a future boon or antagonist to humanity\u2019s best interests isn\u2019t going anywhere."
