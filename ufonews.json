            "article_content": "Former President Jimmy Carter lived 100 years, and accomplished a lot around the world and locally in Georgia. While many will remember what he did professionally as a president or personally as a humanitarian, there are several fun facts and funny stories that some people may not know about.\n\nHere are 5 of the most interesting and bizarre ones:\n\nFILE - Former President Jimmy Carter works on a corbel at the start of the Habitat for Humanity build on Monday, Oct. 7, 2019. His work with the organization was a plot point on an episode of \"Home Improvement\" in which he had a cameo.\n\nJimmy Carter was on \"Home Improvement\"\n\nOne of the most popular sitcoms of the 1990's was \"Home Improvement,\" Tim Allen's first leading project. Carter had a brief cameo in season 3, episode 18. In the episode, Tim Allen's character Tim Taylor and his wife compete to see who can build a house faster as part of Habitat for Humanity, an organization Carter has been a longtime supporter of. Carter appears at the end of the episode in a televised message to the Taylors.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Tim...what can I say?\" Carter said. \"Crews are working around the clock to repair what you built.\"\n\nWant to watch the episode? It's available on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nCarter condolences: Donations to Carter Center encouraged in lieu of flowers. How you can honor Jimmy Carter\n\nFILE - A bouquet of flowers rests at the base of the Smiling Peanut on Monday February 20, 2023 in Plains, Georgia after former President Jimmy Carter went into hospice care. The 13-foot tall roadside attraction is a remnant of Jimmy Carter's 1976 Presidential campaign. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nSmiling Peanut\n\nA 13-foot tall \"Smiling Peanut\" statue was debuted in 1976 by the Indiana Democratic Party as a part of Carter's presidential campaign. It draws a connection between Georgia's iconic crop while bearing a smile reminiscent of Carter's. The peanut is made of solid foam sprayed over a series of metal hoops covered with chicken wire.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has moved around over the years, but today stands in Plains and currently stands at 120 Buena Vista Rd. What's even more interesting about this roadside attraction is a certain local legend: There's a hole in the back which was carved by the Secret Service to ensure there were no assassins or bombs hiding in the peanut.\n\nJimmy Carter saw a UFO\n\nOne of the longest-running, strange stories to surround Carter was the time he saw a UFO. While the exact dates of the sighting is unclear, the story goes that after a dinner more than 50 years ago, Carter said he and several other people saw something in the sky:\n\n\"A kind of green light appeared in the western sky. This was right after sundown. It got brighter and brighter. And then it eventually disappeared. It didn\u2019t have any solid substance to it, it was just a very peculiar looking light. None of us could understand what it was.\u201d\n\nCarter clarified in another interview years later that, while it was an unidentified flying object, he didn't necessarily mean a flying saucer or something similar.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It was unidentified as far as we were concerned, but I think it's impossible, in my opinion, some people may disagree, to have space people from other planets or other stars to come,\" he said.\n\nFILE - Jimmy Carter and Willie Nelson backstage at the Merriwether Post Pavilion in Maryland in 1980. Nelson and other musicians helped put Carter into the White House in 1976. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nJimmy Carter: \"Rock & Roll President\"\n\nAs Variety put it, Carter was remembered as the ultimate music-loving president. He was not only a huge fan of big names like the Allman Brothers and Bob Dylan, but they were also fans of his. The close relationship Carter had with music and musicians was the focus of a documentary called \"Jimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President\" (which you can watch on Max). In the documentary, Carter laughed as he revealed that when Willie Nelson came to stay at the White House, he smoked marijuana with one of his sons.\n\nCarter's awards: When did Jimmy Carter win the Nobel Peace Prize? Here\u2019s a look at 5 of his honors\n\nJimmy Carter missed out on being valedictorian\n\nWhen Carter was graduating from Plains High School in 1941, he was slated to be valedictorian but missed the chance because he skipped a day of classes. He reportedly went to see a movie on April Fool's Day in Americus with some other senior boys. Carter received zeroes for that day and became the salutatorian instead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiguel Legoas is a Deep South Connect Team Reporter for Gannett/USA Today.

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nAt some point, the truth about all of these UFO and drone sightings has to start being revealed. There are just too many eyewitness reports and videos being shared online for governments to just keep pretending like nothing is happening.\n\nIt\u2019s not just in the United States either (though that is where a majority of the reports are originating). They have also been happening in places like the United Kingdom, Germany, and now, in Brazil.\n\nWhile orb-shaped UFOs are perhaps the most common type of UFO that has been seen over the years, triangular-shaped crafts have also been reported being seen quite often.\n\nThe latest triangular-shaped UFO to be reported, and in this case filmed, occurred recently in the Barigui Park, in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.\n\n\u201cI came across the video yesterday while browsing reels on Instagram,\u201d a report written for Ovniologia in Brazil read. \u201cThe account published the footage, called Paranadrone , is a page dedicated to aerial images to with drones and has no connection to the UFO theme.\n\n\u201cI contacted you and requested the original footage, which was sent to me. The video was forwarded them by a follower who requested anonymity. The images were recorded around 8 pm, while the witness was in a trade in the park region.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the video, it is possible to see that the person filming was apparently close to a wall, inside a residence or business, the Paranadro told me. Then, we see a large, luminous point coming from the left, reveals its which triangular shape when the witness zooms in,\u201d the report continued.\n\n\u201cThe object crosses the sky at a considerable and constant speed until it disappears from the author\u2019s field of vision behind the trees. See below.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere we have what appears to be beautiful footage of a triangular UFO. The fixed, unwavering lights at the bottom seem to match reports of these craft. One worth thing noting is the number of lights. As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, three to four lights are usually reported on these objects. However, in the footage, in addition to the three lights at the ends, we can see two more luminous points near the larger central light.\n\n\u201cThis led me to question if it was actually a solid object or just a formation of orbs. While the footage is quite clear, it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe report goes on to say that another witness to the same UFO claimed it had \u201ctwo lights at a considerably low altitude that same day. One of them was in front of her house, with a green and red coloration, while the other, located behind the house, was orange in color and considerably larger.\u201d\n\nHer neighbor also saw the UFO and also filmed it.\n\nThe report by Ovniologia went on to explain, \u201cI spoke to other people who reported strange activity in the skies over Curitiba this month. The reports describe some anomalous sightings and experiences. It is possible that that some incidence of the phenomenon is occurring in the region.\n\n\u201cWhen I watched the video of the triangular UFO, the first thing thing that came to mind was the wave of drones on American soil. Could there be any possible connection? Could it be starting to spread to other regions of the Americas? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSo far, no definitive explanation has been revealed."

            "article_content": "Smaller artificial intelligence stocks have seemingly gone parabolic at the close of 2024, especially those that have been backed by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the form of an investment. Although Nvidia invested a mere $3.7 million in voice-AI start-up SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) about a year ago, that investment put SoundHound squarely on the map as a potential AI winner.\n\nAfter making several accretive acquisitions and racking up an impressive customer list, SoundHound's stock has soared in recent weeks.\n\nIs this price increase a signal that SoundHound could be the next \"killer app\" AI platform? Or is it a sign of a bubble waiting to burst?\n\nWhy SoundHound has made a big noise lately\n\nSoundHound appears to have achieved escape velocity as the go-to voice-enabled AI system outside big tech, especially within the automotive and quick-serve restaurant (QSR) verticals. SoundHound has landed seven of the top 20 QSR brands, including heavyweight Chipotle, for things like phone and drive-through ordering. In automotive, SoundHound's voice AI is now embedded in many leading auto brands such as those owned by car giant Stellantis, as well as four major electric vehicle manufacturers as of last quarter.\n\nIn addition to those two big verticals, this past summer's acquisition of Amelia, another voice-based start-up for enterprises, has boosted SoundHound's enterprise platforms both for customer service applications and employee-facing IT AI applications.\n\nWhy SoundHound has an early lead in voice AI\n\nWhile the generative AI craze has only been happening for two years, SoundHound has actually been around since 2005, and first released its Houndify voice AI platform 10 years later in 2015. So, the company has been developing this technology for a long time.\n\nWhile SoundHound does incorporate other third-party large language models into its products when necessary, it has distinguished itself by building its own proprietary model called Polaris. Polaris is built on its two decades of experience spanning billions of conversations and millions of hours of audio in dozens of languages.\n\nSoundHound has only been building Polaris since LLM training was available, but the platform is already in use for one-third of the company's restaurant ordering transactions, while management aims to eventually use Polaris in all of SoundHound's interactions across its platform.\n\nIn the age of AI, having proprietary data to build one's own model or augment a general-purpose LLM -- in this case, SoundHound's billions of voice transaction data going back decades -- should be a competitive advantage.\n\nStory Continues"

An employee made that comparison in a question that was asked. That\u2019s a big difference between Pichai making that observation (he did not) and an employee suggesting that in a question.\n\nThe context of the phrase about ChatGPT becoming synonymous with AI was that it was asked in a question that Pichai answered.\n\nHere is how CNBC reported a comment submitted by an employee (emphasis mine):\n\n\u201cOne COMMENT read aloud by Pichai suggested that ChatGPT \u2018is becoming synonymous to AI the same way Google is to search,\u2019 with the QUESTIONER asking, \u2018What\u2019s our plan to combat this in the upcoming year? Or are we not focusing as much on consumer facing LLM?'\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s Future Hinges On AI\n\nGoogle CEO, Sundar Pichai, outlined a vision for 2025 that emphasizes an urgency to go back to its roots as a company that innovates quickly, what Pichai referred to as being \u201cscrappy\u201d which means being tough and resourceful, able to accomplish a lot in a quick amount of time (and fewer resources). Most importantly he emphasized solving real-world problems.\n\nHe also prioritizes \u201cbuilding big, new business\u201d which could mean creating new business opportunities with AI, reflecting a strong focus on AI as the engine for innovation in 2025.\n\nGemini App\n\nPichai also cited Gemini App as a central focus for 2025, commenting that they\u2019re experiencing growth with Gemini and that scaling broader adoption of Gemini will be a focus in 2025. This aligns with the observation that Google is increasingly focusing on a Search-adjacent approach to consumer focused AI products and services.\n\nWhat this means for SEO is that we really need to start thinking in terms of a bigger picture of what Search means. Perhaps 2025 will be, after over 15 years of Google\u2019s departure from the ten blue links paradigm, that the SEO community thinks deeper about what search means when it\u2019s multimodal.\n\nPichai was quoted as saying:\n\n\u201cWith the Gemini app, there is strong momentum, particularly over the last few months\u2026 But we have some work to do in 2025 to close the gap and establish a leadership position there as well. \u2026Scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus next year.\u201d\n\nAI Products Will \u201cEvolve Massively\u201d\n\nThe co-founder of Google Deep Mind was quoted as saying that Google was going to \u201cturbo charge\u201d the Gemini app, saying that:\n\n\u201c\u2026the products themselves are going to evolve massively over the next year or two.\u201d\n\nThat means that the Gemini app is going to gain more functionalities in a bid to make it more ubiquitous as the interface between potential website visitors and Google Search, a significant departure from interfacing with the search box.\n\nThis is something that publishers and SEOs need to think really hard about as we enter 2025. Google is focusing on increasing user adoption of the Gemini app. If that happens then that will mean more people interfacing with that instead of the Google Search box.\n\nUniversal Assistant (Project Astra)\n\nAnother thing that the SEO industry seriously needs to consider is Google\u2019s universal assistant that\u2019s code-named Project Astra. The Deep Mind co-founder is reported to have discussed their Universal Assistant, which what Project Astra is referred as.\n\nHe\u2019s quoted as saying that it can:\n\n\u201c\u2026seamlessly operate over any domain, any modality or any device.\u201d\n\nWhat that word \u201cdomain\u201d means is that it can function across any subject, like answering questions about healthcare, directions, entertainment, over any topic. The part about modality is a reference to text, voice, images, and video.\n\nThis is a serious situation for SEO. Google\u2019s new Deep Research agentic search is an example of a disruptive technology that may have a negative impact on the web ecosystem.\n\nOne of the Google Deep Mind researchers cited as working on Project Astra is also listed as a co-inventor on a patent about controlling interactive AI agents through multi-modal inputs.\n\nThe patent is titled, Controlling Interactive Agents Using Multi-Modal Inputs. The description of the invention is:\n\n\u201cMethods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for controlling agents. In particular, an interactive agent can be controlled based on multi-modal inputs that include both an observation image and a natural language text sequence.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just one of dozens of researchers cited as having worked on Project Astra. Astra is another one of the projects that Google is working on that replaces the traditional search box as people\u2019s point of contact for interacting with web data.\n\nTakeaway About Google\u2019s Plans For 2025\n\nThe takeaway from all this is that publishers and SEOs need to take a break from focusing solely on the search box and give some time to considering what\u2019s going on in multimodal AI. In 2025, AI is not just AI Overviews. AI is Gemini, it\u2019s new features coming to Gemini and possibly the release of features developed from Project Astra, a multimodal universal agent. Agentic Search is already here in the form of Gemini Deep Research. All of these are a departure from the traditional search box as the point of contact between users, Google and websites.\n\nRead the report on CNBC\n\nGoogle CEO Pichai tells employees to gear up for big 2025: \u2018The stakes are high\u2019\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/Rokas Tenys"

            "article_content": "A woman vanishes into thin air with a man who does not exist, a dreary village visited by a police party disappears the next day, a burly man suspected of murdering his wife dies mysteriously, and the police officer who witnesses this all is transported 30 years back to his class of 1986 as he steps inside the old building of his alma mater.\n\n\n\nThese are some of the stories in retired IPS officer and ex-chief of the National Security Guard (NSG) M.A. Ganapathy\u2019s debut book Whispers in the Shadows: Paranormal Encounters of a Policeman. The book is unusual in more ways than one. Unlike most ex-cops who would write of tales of bravery, achievements, administrative ills, or insider info, Ganapathy detours towards a path less taken and fictionalises a policeman\u2019s life and gives it a paranormal twist, as if to make sense of many puzzling events he must have witnessed in his long and illustrious career.\n\nThis is an interesting choice given his writing about his work at the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Ministry of Home Affairs, Central Industrial Security Force, and as the DGP of Uttarakhand before hanging his boots as the chief of the NSG earlier this year, could have made for a juicy read.\n\nHowever, the ex-cop takes the Ruskin Bond route of paranormal tales, who also serves as an inspiration. \u201cRuskin Bond\u2019s stories in this genre became my staple at one point, which I read several times over,\u201d Ganapathy writes about the much-loved writer, who, in turn, reviews the book as \u201ccompelling, intriguing and genuine\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy interest in the paranormal was fuelled in no small measure by the stories of certain odd events narrated by my grandfather, a retired forester, who had served in remote corners of South India,\u201d the author writes in the introduction, and it shows. While every short story in this quick-to-read book spanning just over 100 pages is engrossing, the tales where he absolutely shines are those set against forests with spirits and wildlife appearing periodically to seek redemption for the victims through a paranormal route.\n\nThe stories are told through the eyes of Avinash, a diligent and low-profile cop. The first book of any writer is an autobiography of sorts, they say, and it\u2019s evident in Ganapathy\u2019s work as he takes the readers through India\u2019s varied landscapes where he grew up and worked, from his native home in the Western Ghats and alma mater in Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and the Naxal-hit regions of central India.\n\nUnlike how policemen are generally showcased in popular culture as either god-sent or pure evil, Ganapathy doesn\u2019t portray them as either but rather shines the light on the victims. And in the process, he also humanises his lot by focusing on what they experience on the field and their relationship with their work, colleagues, families, teachers, alma mater, and even the victims and the offenders. \u201cWhy do human beings inflict such unspeakable atrocities on other human beings, that too for an outdated ideology, he (Avinash) wondered,\u201d he writes, giving a peak into a policeman\u2019s psyche.\n\nWhispers in the Shadow isn\u2019t your typical horror read. In fact, it doesn\u2019t even use horror to spook the reader but to make sense of the difficult-to-comprehend events and offer closure where none exists. From spooky forest spirits to post-death experiences and time travel, Ganapathy employs just enough elements to make his debut book an interesting and captivating read.\n\nWhispers in the Shadows: Paranormal Encounters of a Policeman\n\nAuthor: M.A. Ganapathy\n\nPublisher: Srishti Publishers and Distributors\n\nPages: 120\n\nPrice: Rs 299"

The next 12 months won\u2019t just bring audiences terrifying sequels like M3GAN 2.0 and 28 Years Later. Audiences will also witness new IPs being brought to life in films like The Monkey and Companion.\n\nNext year should present a healthy balance of familiar and original stories to cinemas and streaming, and these seven movies currently stand out as the most highly-anticipated horror movies of 2025.\n\n7. The Black Phone 2 \u2014 October 17, 2025\n\nUniversal Pictures / Universal Pictures\n\nThe Black Phone, the hit supernatural horror film from director Scott Derrickson, continues its chilling story with this long-awaited sequel. The Black Phone 2 will see the return of stars Mason Thames, Madeline Graw, and Ethan Hawke, the latter of whom played the terrifying serial killer, the Grabber.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering the Grabber\u2019s death at the end of the first film and the ending its young protagonists had, it seemed like the franchise couldn\u2019t go any further. However, since ghosts are an important part of the story, the sequel seems prime to bring the Grabber back to unleash another haunting on Finney and Gwen.\n\n6. Companion \u2014 January 31, 2025\n\nNew Line Cinema / New Line Cinema\n\nProduced by Zach Cregger, writer/director of the horror film Barbarian, Companion features a romance that goes straight to hell when a group of friends get together at a lavish lakeside estate. The film\u2019s darkly humorous trailer shares very little about the plot but does suggest plenty of blood and scares.\n\nIt also hints at a tense and disturbing look into the toxic relationship shared by its two leads, igniting a powder keg of death and terror that must be seen to be believed. The film also features a lead performance from rising Scream Queen Sophie Thatcher, which should attract horror fans\u2019 attention after her riveting performance in 2024\u2019s Heretic.\n\n5. The Monkey \u2014 February 21, 2025\n\nNeon\n\nFresh off the viral success of his chilling horror film Longlegs, director Osgood Perkins will release his adaptation of author Stephen King\u2019s short story The Monkey. This Neon and James Wan-produced film revolves around the titular cursed toy, which unleashes a series of bizarre and gruesome deaths, forcing two brothers to try and destroy it once and for all.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trailers for this film tease a wild but terrifying blend of Annabelle and Final Destination, making for one of the most unique and over-the-top King adaptations in recent memory.\n\n4. The Conjuring: Last Rites \u2014 September 5, 2025\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures / Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs one of the most popular horror movie franchises in modern cinema, The Conjuring Universe will have all eyes on it as it closes the book on its fictionalized accounts of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The story surrounding this frightening fourth film is still unknown \u2014 however, the Warren family\u2019s several real-life cases exploring the supernatural allow for multiple creative possibilities.\n\nIn previous films, the Warrens have faced all sorts of possessions brought on by ghosts, demons, witches, and cursed dolls. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what The Conjuring franchise will unleash next with Last Rites, but it will surely be a fright fest for the ages.\n\n3. M3GAN 2.o \u2014 June 27, 2025\n\nUniversal Pictures / Universal Pictures\n\n2025 will be another big year for killer dolls, particularly due to the upcoming release of M3GAN 2.0 and the return of its titular dancing, slashing robot. It\u2019s unknown what this sci-fi horror sequel will present after the hit original film, which ended with Gemma and Cady destroying M3GAN\u2019s body and the evil AI transferring her consciousness to another machine.\n\nNevertheless, M3GAN seems geared toward exacting bloody vengeance on her former caretakers, making for another gruesome and satirical horror blockbuster for fans to enjoy.\n\n2. Frankenstein \u2014 2025\n\nUniversal Pictures / Universal Pictures\n\nLegendary filmmaker Guillermo del Toro returns to the director\u2019s chair with his adaptation of one of the horror genre\u2019s most popular stories ever. Considering del Toro\u2019s reverence of both Mary Shelley\u2019s source novel and the many films it spawned, 2025\u2019s Frankenstein will likely breathe new life into this iconic tale, adding to the resurgence of classic horror movies brought on by The Invisible Man, Nosferatu, and The Wolf Man.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, with an all-star cast including Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, Mia Goth, and Christoph Waltz, this Netflix-exclusive film will surely electrify the internet once it premieres on streaming.\n\n1. 28 Years Later \u2014 June 20, 2025\n\nSony Pictures Entertainment / Sony Pictures Entertainment\n\nAfter over 20 years of waiting, director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland have returned with their threequel to their iconic zombie movie 28 Days Later. Shot entirely on iPhones, 28 Years Later built up tremendous hype with its haunting teaser trailer, featuring glimpses of evolved zombies and a huge, post-apocalyptic war breaking out decades after the franchise\u2019s film.\n\nThis third movie won\u2019t just include new stars like Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ralph Fiennes. It will also feature the return of actor Cillian Murphy, fresh off his Oscar-winning performance in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer. 28 Years Later even sets up a fourth movie set to premiere in 2026, reinvigorating this groundbreaking zombie franchise for modern audiences as one of the most hotly-anticipated horror blockbusters of 2025."

            "article_content": "An American man living in the UK has shared four observations about Tesco supermarkets - admitting one modern aspect of British superstores has left him baffled.\n\nKalani Smith, who goes by @kalanismith on TikTok, is an influencer and YouTuber who regularly creates content about paranormal activity, but he's recently been documenting quintessentially British experiences during his stay in the UK.\n\nSince being in the UK, he's also captured the interest of millions by filming himself trying a variety of different British cuisines - from fish and chips in St. Andrews to a Sunday roast in London.\n\nBut his recent video captured the interest of both Brits and Americans after he shared his thoughts about British superstores whilst out shopping with his partner at a Tesco Extra.\n\nCapturing their visit in a three-minute clip, Kalani was left in awe as he approached the entrance of the large supermarket, adding: 'Look at the size of this store. I thought you guys said you didn't have big stores over here.'\n\nThe first observation the content creator noted was the opening hours of the superstore, going on to explain how Tesco Extra stays open until midnight while Walmart in the States closes at 11pm.\n\nAs he entered the store, Kalani stumbled across a section of handheld scanners - and the content creator didn't hold back from expressing his confusion over the device.\n\nHe said: 'It's kinda weird. You can scan your stuff and pay for it with these little handheld devices. We don't really have these in the U.S.'\n\nKalani Smith, an American man living in the UK has shared four observations about Tesco supermarkets - including one aspect he reported to have found 'weird'\n\nNext, Kalani entered the refrigerated meat aisle, where he observed shelves filled with bacon, pork, lamb and sausages.\n\nHowever, he was left dumbfounded, noting that there are 'so many sausages in the UK' and that he's 'never seen so much meat in one spot.'\n\nLastly, the content creator highlighted the difference between the frozen aisles in the UK and U.S.\n\nAs he explored the area, he explained: 'I think what's really weird compared to America is there's only three rows for frozen meals, whereas I feel like we have more of these in America.'\n\nThe content creator concluded the video by announcing his need to use the bathroom, but as he approached the toilets, he was left scratching his head after finding it locked with a padlock.\n\nIn the comments, dozens of viewers shared their thoughts, with one Brit advising: 'There\u2019s Iceland and farm foods they are shops of just frozen foods.'\n\nAs he entered the store, Kalani stumbled across a section of handheld scanners - and the content creator didn't hold back from expressing his confusion over the device\n\nAnother Briton remarked: 'Tesco used to have a lot of stores open 24 hours but they started closing them.'\n\nAn American, meanwhile, was left impressed by what Tesco had to offer, as they wrote: 'Oh my gosh that looks [like an] amazing store.'\n\nIt comes as an American man living in the UK has shared his shock at five stark differences between grocery shopping in Britain and back home.\n\nKobie Jordan, a TikTok content creator known as @kjordyyy, often explores cultural contrasts between the two countries, both through street interviews with Brits and sharing his own experiences online.\n\nIn a video uploaded in August, titled 'Grocery shopping in London as an American,' Jordan shared his observations whilst shopping for necessities in his local Sainsbury's supermarket.\n\nFilming his visit, the content creator singled out specific items while weighing up the pros and cons of varieties available in supermarkets in both nations."

            "article_content": "An increasingly diverse coalition is forming in opposition to OpenAI\u2019s plan to restructure itself into a fully for-profit company.\n\nOn Monday, Encode, a youth-led advocacy organization representing young people in dozens of countries, filed an amicus brief in support of Elon Musk\u2019s ongoing lawsuit to stop OpenAI\u2019s corporate metamorphosis. The filing came with support from one of the biggest names in the field, Nobel and Turing prizes award-winner Geoffrey Hinton, who is often called the godfather of AI.\n\n\u201cOpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused non-profit and made a variety of safety-related promises in its charter,\u201d Hinton said in a statement released by Encode along with its brief. \u201cIt received numerous tax and other benefits from its non-profit status. Allowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nHinton recently told the BBC he believes there is a \u201c10 percent to 20 percent\u201d chance that AI will lead to human extinction within the next 30 years. Previously, Hinton\u2019s been more modest, putting the odds at just 10 percent.\n\nOpenAI is currently structured as a for-profit company controlled by a non-profit board, which places some restrictions on its mission and ability to raise money and compensate investors. The company formally announced its intention to restructure itself as a more traditional for-profit corporation last week, although the change had been anticipated for some time and Musk, who was a cofounder of OpenAI, filed his federal lawsuit seeking a preliminary injunction to stop it in November.\n\nEncode argues that OpenAI\u2019s planned shift from a nonprofit to a Delaware public benefit corporation would \u201cundermine specific safety-focused commitments the nonprofit has made to the public.\u201d In particular, the brief questions whether a for-profit corporation could ever fulfill OpenAI\u2019s promise that it will \u201cstop competing with and start assisting\u201d any value-aligned organization that appears close to building artificial general intelligence before it does.\n\n\u201cToday, a handful of companies are racing to develop and deploy transformative AI, internalizing the profits but externalizing the consequences to all of humanity,\u201d Sneha Revanur, the president and founder of Encode, said in a statement. \u201cThe courts must intervene to ensure AI development serves the public interest.\u201d\n\nFor its part, OpenAI has urged the court to reject Musk\u2019s lawsuit, arguing that he lacks standing and is seeking to gain an unfair competitive advantage for his own AI startup, xAI. OpenAI also released a trove of emails and other messages from Musk, including several that the company said showed Musk advocated for converting the organization to a for-profit as early as 2017."

But many programmers still find that they don\u2019t need much more than a trustworthy ledger for many tasks. The relative costs of the two systems are a rough indicator of general demand. While this is always clouded by the hype and foolish dreams, it still can be a gauge for just what the people need from the systems.\n\nHot: GraphQL\n\nNot: REST\n\nIt\u2019s not as if REST is dead. It\u2019s just that we want to do more with the API, and GraphQL is a way to do it. GraphQL returns the data in JSON, just like REST. GraphQL starts off with an HTTP POST, just like many REST calls. It\u2019s just that the GraphQL syntax allows you to specify very complex queries with only a few keystrokes. This makes it simpler for programmers to ask for just what they want, and it reduces the amount of server-side work that must be done when someone wants a slightly different API.\n\nHot: Static site generators\n\nNot: Single-page apps\n\nRemember when URLs pointed to web pages filled with static text and images? Then the single-page web apps came along and replaced them all with some clever JavaScript that would fetch the content dynamically, without refreshing the entire page. Guess what? The pendulum is swinging back and all of the cool kids are building static site generators. There are dozens of them. It\u2019s like a hybrid. You put all of the data in one pile and then you write some code that sticks the data into some templates. You end up with one HTML file for each static URL, which corresponds to each row in your table of data."

            "article_content": "\"The cloud\" refers to the smooth delivery of computer services via the Internet. Businesses and individuals can use cloud computing to access computer resources, including databases, software, and storage, through the Internet and only pay for the services they use. The word \"cloud computing\" refers to a broad category of services that are constantly growing, such as software (SaaS), development platforms (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS). Instead of investing millions of dollars in on-premise infrastructure and IT staff to maintain it, businesses can concentrate on their core competencies thanks to the rapid and reasonably priced access to these services. Nowadays, it's challenging to think of a company that doesn't use cloud computing in some capacity. To stay competitive, foster collaboration, and accelerate time to market, the top performers in every industry are increasingly investing in the cloud. Given the increasing severity of cybercrimes, we predict that more and more businesses will use DevSecOps in 2025 to create highly safe software. Let's read further about Cloud Computing Trends for 2025.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat does cloud computing look like in 2025?\n\nTo improve resilience and flexibility, businesses will move increasingly to multi-cloud systems by 2025, eschewing reliance on a single vendor. Distributing workloads among several cloud providers helps enterprises maximize both cost and performance.\n\nWill AI replace cloud computing?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlthough AI is changing technology, cloud computing is unlikely to be entirely replaced by it. Instead, these technologies work in tandem to improve one another's capabilities.\n\nCloud Computing Trends for 2025\n\nGrowing Adoption of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nTo improve operational flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, businesses are shifting to hybrid and multi-cloud strategies. Thanks to this development, Businesses may now use the advantages of several cloud providers. The increased use and adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud models is the second trend on our list of the most critical cloud trends. When a company divides its data between a private cloud or on-premise data center and a public cloud, this is known as a hybrid cloud setup. Using a hybrid cloud strategy, you can choose which workload or process to move to the cloud and which data and apps to run in an internal data center.\n\nA multi-cloud environment is another computer configuration where businesses disperse their infrastructure across two or more cloud environments. Numerous advantages result from this strategy, including greater flexibility, access to particular cloud environment features, and the absence of vendor lock-in concerns. Businesses are already investing in hybrid and multi-cloud architectures to support their operations, guarantee higher customer happiness, and reduce development costs. Cloud service companies will keep improving their products over the next ten years. However, many companies will realize that implementing a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy is more beneficial.\n\nAI Integration:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAI will play a crucial role in cloud operations by automating resource allocation, scaling, and security protocols. Businesses will become more cost-effective and efficient as a result of this integration. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are essential elements of the contemporary IT environment. These technologies automate processes, decrease human error, increase operational efficiency, and produce rapid, data-driven insights.\n\nTheir applications in various industries are expanding. For instance, businesses like Netflix and Amazon employ AI to understand consumers' preferences and dislikes better and provide more tailored recommendations. However, to create and run customized models, spot trends, and forecast the future, AI and machine learning need enormous volumes of clean data\u2014a handy and crucial skill for someone in the manufacturing industry. The need for nearly limitless cloud computing resources was further accelerated by generating, storing, and processing such vast volumes of data.\n\nLeading cloud service providers now provide built-in AI and ML solutions to support their clients' innovation and AI/ML capabilities integration into their software products. Prominent companies and brands believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future and that it will likely transform how we use applications and services and do business in less than ten years. The market for cloud computing is expected to develop significantly due to the sharp increase in demand for AI and ML-driven apps and solutions, which will also fuel demand for more affordable and integrated cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEdge Computing:\n\nEdge computing will become more popular as the need for real-time data processing increases. This technology lowers latency and boosts efficiency by processing data closer to its source. Our list of the leading trends in the cloud sector also includes edge computing. The phrase \"edge computing\" is self-explanatory: it moves processing and storage closer to the gadgets that generate information and the people who utilize it. Software programs are typically made to send and receive data from remote storage sites, like cloud infrastructure or on-premises servers. For increasing use cases, this type of computing and processing configuration may not be the ideal choice.\n\nReduced latency, enhanced productivity, remote data collecting, enhanced data security and compliance, and dependable performance are just a few advantages that edge computing can help you access. Top cloud service providers like Amazon AWS also offer edge computing services to assist clients in reacting to information more quickly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nServerless Computing:\n\nAs serverless architectures become more popular, developers can concentrate on writing code rather than maintaining infrastructure, speeding up deployment times. Development teams may create and execute apps at the speed of business with serverless computing, a cloud computing execution methodology.\n\nThe computing model abstracts the intricacies of server administration from the app development process. Provisioning and administering the cloud infrastructure by the particular requirements of the software application or development team is the duty of cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. Since serverless computing is still in its infancy, not all possible applications can benefit. However, there will be significant advancements in cloud computing over the next ten years or more. These advancements will undoubtedly make cloud computing a far more thrilling, cost-effective, and speed-driven experience for businesses and individuals everywhere.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms:\n\nBy enabling individuals with little to no coding knowledge to create applications, these platforms will democratize app creation and lessen reliance on IT departments. AI-powered low-code and no-code cloud solutions are the newest talking points among tech and business leaders and the development community.\n\nLow-code and no-code development has seen significant investments from many start-ups and well-established IT giants in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world. Because of this, LCNC platforms are included in our list of important cloud technology developments for 2025 and beyond. These cloud-based solutions, which appear to be magical, abstract away the complexity of coding and make it more accessible to all types of enterprises. The development and uptake of low-code and no-code technology are still in their infancy."

            "article_content": "You have to buy me one fat frog every time you text your ex next year\n\n6 seconds ago\n\nIs a new year, new you right around the corner as we all pop to the shops to buy our green grapes and red underwear in preparation for the big night? Even if you haven\u2019t fallen victim to the TikTok trends going into 2025, no doubt you\u2019ve promised yourself that you\u2019ll sign up for the uni gym and stop forgetting your cash on a Monday night at The Raz.\n\nAll students in Liverpool have their vices \u2013 the Elf Bars can only get you through a few days of seasonal depression and withdrawals from your mum\u2019s Christmas dinner before you\u2019re up at 3am making a vision board and completely reinventing yourself. So whether you\u2019re looking to give up fat frogs, find the love of your life skating by the Pier Head, or just want to attend more than two lectures a week, you\u2019re in the right place.\n\nHopefully these resolutions for 2025 will fill you with hope and ambition rather than the all-consuming feeling of guilt and paranoia we\u2019ve all experienced at some point. No doubt you won\u2019t follow any of them and still end up being that one third year who\u2019s blackout drunk at AU night. Happy New Year!\n\nStop trying to find your lost parcel on the Smithdown Matters Facebook page\n\nLet\u2019s face it, a middle aged scouser is probably trying on your Oh Polly parcel as we speak. You can only pray that you\u2019ve not lost the envelope that has your missing ID in it, or any birthday money from your grandparents. There\u2019s only so many times you can ask for the neighbours\u2019 names from the house opposite you, and sometimes you just have to come to terms with the fact that yor Vinted parcel has become part of a student house\u2019s secret santa for the year.\n\nCut down the amount of cash you bring out on a Monday at The Raz\n\nRealistically speaking, telling a medical professional that you consumed 34 raz-bombs the night before a 9am lecture should genuinely be a criminal offence. Adding in the fact that that only cost you \u00a337 in total with entry, they\u2019ll probably give you a pat on the back, but your housemates certainly won\u2019t be celebrating your achievements when you\u2019re throwing up against a lamppost whilst simultaneously crying at the transaction notifications from your bank. Getting a grip is a commendable feat, we promise.\n\nStart wearing multiple layers to the Grove Wing of the Sydney Jones\n\nAlternatively, start protesting against the energy saving in all the libraries and make them turn the heating on. Why is it so cold and why do I never learn to pack a jumper?\n\nStop regretting which modules you picked last year (and complaining about it)\n\nIt\u2019s literally your fault that you picked that one really niche module about Northern Irish art history or coding obscure maths data in Spanish, sorry. Maybe your goal for 2025 is to fulfil the academic weapon role you thought you\u2019d adopt after your first year at uni.\n\nStop getting blackout drunk at pres\u2026\n\nI wish I took a mental note of my alcohol tolerance every time I got caught throwing up outside The Lime Kiln but you win some, you lose some I suppose. Sometimes necking an entire bottle of cheap wine from Wag 1 Offy isn\u2019t the move, and you definitely don\u2019t need that concoction of leftover gin, out of date fruit juice and off brand lemonade to take with you as \u201cjourney juice\u201d. Maybe Dry January would be a good idea for you x\n\nBut start ACTUALLY going to pres\n\nNo doubt you\u2019re getting paralytic before every night out because you\u2019re only doing one every three months \u2013 stop saying no to social plans just because you\u2019ve got assignments to do or CVs to write. The time will make itself for your uni work, but never stops when it comes to piling in an Uber at 3am with no plans, just a few weird props you acquired from the living room floor. It\u2019s all well and good entering your intelligent era next year, but you deserve to let your hair down too. You\u2019ll regret it otherwise, trust me.\n\nStart washing up everything in the sink of your uni kitchen\n\nSink does not equal dumping ground for crusty pasta bowls.\n\nStop making friends with the bossmen on Leece Street\n\nAs hilarious as it was to be a fresher behind the counter in Hot n Tender, there\u2019s nothing more embarrassing than seeing videos of drunk you taking orders from a confused bunch of third years just popping in for a kebab. Save yourself the shame of initiating a love story with the chicken shop man.\n\nStop adding to the bin mountain\n\nSelf-explanatory.\n\nStart walking from Smithdown to uni even when your mates don\u2019t go\n\nThe feeling of betrayal you experience when you wake up in time for a 10am, get yourself ready with the expectation that all of your coursemates are meeting you on the way to walk to campus, and then seeing that they haven\u2019t been active for 14 hours, is incomparable to anything else. The brand new 2025 you should be brave enough to trek from Smithdown to South Campus Teaching Hub solo, even on a chilly morning. Use it as your hot girl walk and opportunity to listen to a weirdly niche podcast, or stomp along to your \u201cmisty mountain solo self reflection main character moment jams\u201d daylist on Spotify.\n\nStart giving yourself a break from uni assignments\n\nAlong the same lines of actually having a night off to head out on the town with your flatmates, having a relaxing evening tucked up on the sofa with a friend or two can do you wonders mid-semester. There\u2019s only so many late night study sessions you can pull off before you\u2019re burnt out and start to convince yourself that your housemates have forgotten that you exist and you\u2019ll never find a graduate job with an arts degree. So not true! Have a break, have a self care night, have a cheeky takeaway. You deserve it.\n\nStop spending half your student loan on sweet treats\n\nHowever, when you do manage to get that 4000 word assignment started, spending \u00a33 on a pastry after every 150 words is actually quite bad for your bank account \u2013 or so I\u2019ve heard.\n\nStart saying no to Concert Square for a night out\n\nWe\u2019ve all got that one friend that wants to start the night in SOHO or MODO for the \u201cvibes\u201d but you always end up feeling sober, freezing cold and no longer excited to go out. There are so many venues and clubs in Liverpool to test out once or twice, so make a list with your friends of your ideal places to visit and branch out a little! The nightlife scene in town defo stretches further than Concert Square and Quick Burger, you just have to look for it.\n\nStop texting your ex\n\nTHEY ARE NOT THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.\n\nIf they\u2019re an avid Skint goer, on any of the snowsports society boards at John Moores, or genuinely disagree that pineapple doesn\u2019t belong on pizza, then they\u2019re not for you I\u2019m afraid. Get those grapes down you on New Years babe.\n\nStop avoiding walking up Brownlow Hill\n\nWhat happened to those 75 hard plans you made, eh? Taking the long way through campus to avoid clambering up Brownlow Hill is not part of the hot girl gym aesthetic you put on your vision board for 2025. Get those legs moving and squint through your tears, it\u2019s not that bad. Joking. LOL.\n\nStart making time to visit your friends or invite them to visit you\n\nA little bit of home never does anyone any harm. Dragging your home friends up to Liverpool to give them a tour around the Docks and Baltic Market will help you take your mind off things when you\u2019re fighting those winter blues. Sometimes you just need that comfort of getting wine drunk with your best friends in a different city \u2013 making time for this in the new year can do wonders for you.\n\nStop being scared of the teenagers on Lawrence Road\n\nSeriously though, why are they so scary?\n\nStart making moves on your library crush\n\nOur Library Crush feature on Instagram hears, sees and knows everything you\u2019d be dying to know about everyone\u2019s love lives on campus, believe me. There\u2019s nothing more exhilarating than noticing the love of your uni life sitting across from you in the Hogwarts room in the Harold Cohen, or brushing past them on the stairs in the Sydney Jones. I expect to see you all flirting in the Starbucks in time for Valentine\u2019s Day this year.\n\nStop putting the attendance code in for seminars after 11am\n\nIf it\u2019s past 11am just get a grip and go onto campus, surely? The only exception MIGHT be the Thursday after AU night, but you\u2019re admitting your weaknesses if you\u2019re asking the course group chat for the attendance code for the 2pm seminar.\n\nStop being afraid to do things solo\n\nLiverpool is an incredible city with so many activities and places to visit \u2013 if none of them take the fancy of your friends or housemates, don\u2019t be afraid to go and explore things on your own! Incorporating solo dates into your resolutions for 2025 is so cute and VERY mindful.\n\nStart applying to jobs to fuel your Gourmet Grill/Nabzy\u2019s/Harper\u2019s addiction\n\nThere\u2019s only so far a trust fund will stretch when it comes to cheesy chips and gyros unfortunately.\n\nTake our advice and run with it \u2013 we know you won\u2019t stick to any of these resolutions and can\u2019t wait to hear how miserable we all feel by the Easter break. If you manage to find a way to romanticise January and the dreaded exam season, please let us know."

File Photo by Tannen Maury/UPI | License Photo\n\nNASA's upcoming Artemis II mission is slated to return astronauts to the moon no sooner than April 2026. Astronauts were last on the moon in 1972 during the Apollo 17 mission. Artemis II will utilize NASA's Space Launch System, which is an extremely powerful rocket that will enable human space exploration beyond Earth's atmosphere. The crew of four will travel in an Orion spacecraft, which the agency launched around the moon and successfully returned during the Artemis I mission. Advertisement\n\nBut before Artemis II, NASA will send two missions to scout the surface of the lunar south pole for resources that could sustain human space travel and enable new scientific discoveries.\n\nPlanetary geologists like me are interested in data from Lunar Trailblazer, one of these two scouting missions. The data from this mission will help us understand how water forms and behaves on rocky planets and moons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStarting with scientific exploration\n\nPRIME-1, or the Polar Resources Ice Mining Experiment, will be mounted on a lunar lander. It's scheduled for launch in January 2025.\n\nAboard the lander are two instruments: The Regolith and Ice Drill for Exploring New Terrain, TRIDENT, and the Mass Spectrometer for Observing Lunar Operations, MSOLO. TRIDENT will dig down up to 3 feet (1 meter) and extract samples of lunar soil, and MSOLO will evaluate the soil's chemical composition and water content.\n\nJoining the lunar mining experiment is Lunar Trailblazer, a satellite launching on the same Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nThink of this setup as a multimillion-dollar satellite Uber pool, or a rideshare where multiple missions share a rocket and minimize fuel usage while escaping Earth's gravitational pull.\n\nBethany Ehlmann, a planetary scientist, is the principal investigator of Lunar Trailblazer and is leading an operating team of scientists and students from Caltech's campus. Trailblazer is a NASA Small, Innovative Mission for PLanetary Exploration, or SIMPLEx.\n\nThese missions intend to provide practical operations experience at a lower cost. Each SIMPLEx mission is capped at a budget of $55 million -- Trailblazer is slightly over budget at $80 million. Even over budget, this mission will cost around a quarter of a typical robotic mission from NASA's Discovery Program. Discovery Program missions typically cost around $300 million, with a maximum budget of $500 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuilding small but mighty satellites\n\nDecades of research and development into small satellites, or SmallSats, opened the possibility for Trailblazer. SmallSats take highly specific measurements and complement data sourced from other instruments.\n\nMultiple SmallSats working together in a constellation can take various measurements simultaneously for a high-resolution view of the Earth's or moon's surface.\n\nSIMPLEx missions can use these SmallSats. Because they're small and more affordable, they allow researchers to study questions that come with a higher technical risk. Lunar Trailblazer, for example, uses commercial off-the-shelf parts to keep the cost down.\n\nThese low-cost, high-risk experimental missions may help geologists further understand the origin of the solar system, as well as what it's made of and how it has changed over time. Lunar Trailblazer will focus specifically on mapping the moon.\n\nA brief timeline of water discoveries on the Moon\n\nScientists have long been fascinated by the surface of our closest celestial neighbor, the Moon. As early as the mid-17th century, astronomers mischaracterized ancient volcanic eruptions as lunar mare, derived from the Latin word for \"seas.\"\n\nNearly two centuries later, astronomer William Pickering's calculations suggested that the Moon had no atmosphere. This led him to conclude the moon could not have water on its surface, as that water would vaporize.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, in the 1990s, NASA's Clementine mission detected water on the moon. Clementine was the first mission to completely map the surface of the moon, including the lunar poles. This data detected the presence of ice within permanently shadowed regions on the moon in low resolution.\n\nScientists' first water detection prompted further exploration. NASA launched the Lunar Prospector in 1998 and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2009. The India Space Research Organization launched its Chandrayaan-1 mission with the Moon Mineralogy Mapper, M3, instrument in 2008. M3, although not designed to detected liquid water, unexpectedly did find it in sunlit areas on the moon.\n\nThese missions collectively provided maps showing how hydrous minerals -- minerals containing water molecules in their chemical makeup -- and ice water are distributed on the lunar surface, particularly in the cold, dark, permanently shadowed regions.\n\nNovel mission, novel science\n\nBut how does the temperature and physical state of water on the moon change from variations in sunlight and crater shadows?\n\nLunar Trailblazer will host two instruments, the Lunar Thermal Mapper, LTM, and an evolution of the M3 instrument, the High-resolution Volatiles and Minerals Moon Mapper, HVM3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe LTM instrument will map surface temperature, while the HVM3 will measure how lunar rocks absorb light. These measurements will allow it to detect and distinguish between water in liquid and ice forms.\n\nIn tandem, these instruments will provide thermal and chemical measurements of hydrous lunar rock. They'll measure water during various times of the lunar day, which is about 29.5 Earth days, to try to show how the chemical composition of water varies depending on the time of day and where it is on the moon.\n\nThese results will tell researchers what phase -- solid or liquid -- the water is found in.\n\nScientific significance and what's next\n\nThere are three leading theories for where lunar water came from. It could be water that's been stored inside the moon since its formation, in its mantle layer. Some geologic processes may have allowed it to slowly escape to the surface over time.\n\nOr, the water may have arrived on asteroids and comets that collided with the lunar surface. It may even have been created by interactions with the solar wind, which is a stream of particles that comes from the sun.\n\nLunar Trailblazer may shed light on these theories and help researchers make progress on several other big science questions, including how water behaves on rocky bodies like the moon and whether future astronauts will be able to use it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nC\u00e9sar Le\u00f3n Jr. is a Ph.D. student of planetary geology at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

            "article_content": "\"The cloud\" refers to the smooth delivery of computer services via the Internet. Businesses and individuals can use cloud computing to access computer resources, including databases, software, and storage, through the Internet and only pay for the services they use. The word \"cloud computing\" refers to a broad category of services that are constantly growing, such as software (SaaS), development platforms (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS). Instead of investing millions of dollars in on-premise infrastructure and IT staff to maintain it, businesses can concentrate on their core competencies thanks to the rapid and reasonably priced access to these services. Nowadays, it's challenging to think of a company that doesn't use cloud computing in some capacity. To stay competitive, foster collaboration, and accelerate time to market, the top performers in every industry are increasingly investing in the cloud. Given the increasing severity of cybercrimes, we predict that more and more businesses will use DevSecOps in 2025 to create highly safe software. Let's read further about Cloud Computing Trends for 2025.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat does cloud computing look like in 2025?\n\nTo improve resilience and flexibility, businesses will move increasingly to multi-cloud systems by 2025, eschewing reliance on a single vendor. Distributing workloads among several cloud providers helps enterprises maximize both cost and performance.\n\nWill AI replace cloud computing?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlthough AI is changing technology, cloud computing is unlikely to be entirely replaced by it. Instead, these technologies work in tandem to improve one another's capabilities.\n\nCloud Computing Trends for 2025\n\nGrowing Adoption of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nTo improve operational flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, businesses are shifting to hybrid and multi-cloud strategies. Thanks to this development, Businesses may now use the advantages of several cloud providers. The increased use and adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud models is the second trend on our list of the most critical cloud trends. When a company divides its data between a private cloud or on-premise data center and a public cloud, this is known as a hybrid cloud setup. Using a hybrid cloud strategy, you can choose which workload or process to move to the cloud and which data and apps to run in an internal data center.\n\nA multi-cloud environment is another computer configuration where businesses disperse their infrastructure across two or more cloud environments. Numerous advantages result from this strategy, including greater flexibility, access to particular cloud environment features, and the absence of vendor lock-in concerns. Businesses are already investing in hybrid and multi-cloud architectures to support their operations, guarantee higher customer happiness, and reduce development costs. Cloud service companies will keep improving their products over the next ten years. However, many companies will realize that implementing a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy is more beneficial.\n\nAI Integration:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAI will play a crucial role in cloud operations by automating resource allocation, scaling, and security protocols. Businesses will become more cost-effective and efficient as a result of this integration. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are essential elements of the contemporary IT environment. These technologies automate processes, decrease human error, increase operational efficiency, and produce rapid, data-driven insights.\n\nTheir applications in various industries are expanding. For instance, businesses like Netflix and Amazon employ AI to understand consumers' preferences and dislikes better and provide more tailored recommendations. However, to create and run customized models, spot trends, and forecast the future, AI and machine learning need enormous volumes of clean data\u2014a handy and crucial skill for someone in the manufacturing industry. The need for nearly limitless cloud computing resources was further accelerated by generating, storing, and processing such vast volumes of data.\n\nLeading cloud service providers now provide built-in AI and ML solutions to support their clients' innovation and AI/ML capabilities integration into their software products. Prominent companies and brands believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future and that it will likely transform how we use applications and services and do business in less than ten years. The market for cloud computing is expected to develop significantly due to the sharp increase in demand for AI and ML-driven apps and solutions, which will also fuel demand for more affordable and integrated cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEdge Computing:\n\nEdge computing will become more popular as the need for real-time data processing increases. This technology lowers latency and boosts efficiency by processing data closer to its source. Our list of the leading trends in the cloud sector also includes edge computing. The phrase \"edge computing\" is self-explanatory: it moves processing and storage closer to the gadgets that generate information and the people who utilize it. Software programs are typically made to send and receive data from remote storage sites, like cloud infrastructure or on-premises servers. For increasing use cases, this type of computing and processing configuration may not be the ideal choice.\n\nReduced latency, enhanced productivity, remote data collecting, enhanced data security and compliance, and dependable performance are just a few advantages that edge computing can help you access. Top cloud service providers like Amazon AWS also offer edge computing services to assist clients in reacting to information more quickly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nServerless Computing:\n\nAs serverless architectures become more popular, developers can concentrate on writing code rather than maintaining infrastructure, speeding up deployment times. Development teams may create and execute apps at the speed of business with serverless computing, a cloud computing execution methodology.\n\nThe computing model abstracts the intricacies of server administration from the app development process. Provisioning and administering the cloud infrastructure by the particular requirements of the software application or development team is the duty of cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. Since serverless computing is still in its infancy, not all possible applications can benefit. However, there will be significant advancements in cloud computing over the next ten years or more. These advancements will undoubtedly make cloud computing a far more thrilling, cost-effective, and speed-driven experience for businesses and individuals everywhere.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms:\n\nBy enabling individuals with little to no coding knowledge to create applications, these platforms will democratize app creation and lessen reliance on IT departments. AI-powered low-code and no-code cloud solutions are the newest talking points among tech and business leaders and the development community.\n\nLow-code and no-code development has seen significant investments from many start-ups and well-established IT giants in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world. Because of this, LCNC platforms are included in our list of important cloud technology developments for 2025 and beyond. These cloud-based solutions, which appear to be magical, abstract away the complexity of coding and make it more accessible to all types of enterprises. The development and uptake of low-code and no-code technology are still in their infancy."

Prominent companies and brands believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future and that it will likely transform how we use applications and services and do business in less than ten years. The market for cloud computing is expected to develop significantly due to the sharp increase in demand for AI and ML-driven apps and solutions, which will also fuel demand for more affordable and integrated cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEdge Computing:\n\nEdge computing will become more popular as the need for real-time data processing increases. This technology lowers latency and boosts efficiency by processing data closer to its source. Our list of the leading trends in the cloud sector also includes edge computing. The phrase \"edge computing\" is self-explanatory: it moves processing and storage closer to the gadgets that generate information and the people who utilize it. Software programs are typically made to send and receive data from remote storage sites, like cloud infrastructure or on-premises servers. For increasing use cases, this type of computing and processing configuration may not be the ideal choice.\n\nReduced latency, enhanced productivity, remote data collecting, enhanced data security and compliance, and dependable performance are just a few advantages that edge computing can help you access. Top cloud service providers like Amazon AWS also offer edge computing services to assist clients in reacting to information more quickly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nServerless Computing:\n\nAs serverless architectures become more popular, developers can concentrate on writing code rather than maintaining infrastructure, speeding up deployment times. Development teams may create and execute apps at the speed of business with serverless computing, a cloud computing execution methodology.\n\nThe computing model abstracts the intricacies of server administration from the app development process. Provisioning and administering the cloud infrastructure by the particular requirements of the software application or development team is the duty of cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. Since serverless computing is still in its infancy, not all possible applications can benefit. However, there will be significant advancements in cloud computing over the next ten years or more. These advancements will undoubtedly make cloud computing a far more thrilling, cost-effective, and speed-driven experience for businesses and individuals everywhere.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms:\n\nBy enabling individuals with little to no coding knowledge to create applications, these platforms will democratize app creation and lessen reliance on IT departments. AI-powered low-code and no-code cloud solutions are the newest talking points among tech and business leaders and the development community.\n\nLow-code and no-code development has seen significant investments from many start-ups and well-established IT giants in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world. Because of this, LCNC platforms are included in our list of important cloud technology developments for 2025 and beyond. These cloud-based solutions, which appear to be magical, abstract away the complexity of coding and make it more accessible to all types of enterprises. The development and uptake of low-code and no-code technology are still in their infancy."

            "article_content": "There are workarounds. There are now dozens of chains running Ethereum or Ethereum-like protocols and their gas costs can be much lower. But many programmers still find that they don\u2019t need much more than a trustworthy ledger for many tasks. The relative costs of the two systems are a rough indicator of general demand. While this is always clouded by the hype and foolish dreams, it still can be a gauge for just what the people need from the systems.\n\nHot: GraphQL\n\nNot: REST\n\nIt\u2019s not as if REST is dead. It\u2019s just that we want to do more with the API, and GraphQL is a way to do it. GraphQL returns the data in JSON, just like REST. GraphQL starts off with an HTTP POST, just like many REST calls. It\u2019s just that the GraphQL syntax allows you to specify very complex queries with only a few keystrokes. This makes it simpler for programmers to ask for just what they want, and it reduces the amount of server-side work that must be done when someone wants a slightly different API.\n\nHot: Static site generators\n\nNot: Single-page apps\n\nRemember when URLs pointed to web pages filled with static text and images? Then the single-page web apps came along and replaced them all with some clever JavaScript that would fetch the content dynamically, without refreshing the entire page. Guess what? The pendulum is swinging back and all of the cool kids are building static site generators. There are dozens of them. It\u2019s like a hybrid. You put all of the data in one pile and then you write some code that sticks the data into some templates. You end up with one HTML file for each static URL, which corresponds to each row in your table of data."

            "article_content": "Introduction\n\nTime and again, Data Science has made its mark on human society. It is repeatedly making headlines in newspapers and magazines. It mainly involves getting insights from huge datasets and making decisions based on the analysed data.\n\nData Science is significant as it helps companies to optimise their process. Companies can also predict trends and find answers to difficult questions with the help of it. Machine Learning plays an important part in this whole process.\n\nMachine Learning transforms Data Science processes by automating repetitive and boring tasks. It also helps in identifying patterns in data and improving the accuracy of prediction. The aim of this article is to explore how Machine Learning enhances each stage of the Data Science process.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Machine Learning, then you need to enrol in free Data Science courses and learn Data Science free. Hence, you can focus on your learning without worrying about financial limitations.\n\nCore Components of Data Science Processes\n\nNow, we\u2019ll look at the core components of Data Science processes. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, Data Science focuses on getting insights from raw data. It follows a systematic approach in this process. There are several steps involved, and each step plays an important role. Let\u2019s explore these steps in detail.\n\nData Collection and Preprocessing\n\nData collection and preprocessing is the first step in the Data Science process. Data collection involves getting relevant and appropriate data. The data can come from various sources like databases, APIs and manual inputs. It is important to collect data appropriately as it lays down the foundation for correct analysis.\n\nWhen raw data is collected, it has inconsistencies like missing values, duplicates, or outliers. Here comes the role of data preprocessing. It involves cleaning and structuring the data for analysis.\n\nSeveral techniques like imputation, normalisation, and feature engineering are also used in this step. These techniques make the data ready for later stages of the Data Science process. It is important to invest time in preprocessing as it reduces errors and improves the accuracy of the model.\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the second step in the Data Science process. It helps in discovering patterns in the data. It also helps in uncovering the trends and relationships within the data. In this step, statistical methods and visualisation tools are used. These help in better understanding the characteristics of data.\n\nEDA gives you the roadmap for modelling by plotting distributions and identifying correlations. It\u2019ll also help you with detecting anomalies in the data. With the help of EDA analysts can make crucial decisions like selecting appropriate features. It also helps in handling uneven data.\n\nMany tools are used in this process like Pandas and Matplotlib library of Python. Other than this, Tableau and PowerBI are also used to make this process effective.\n\nModelling, Evaluation, and Deployment\n\nModelling, evaluation and deployment is the third step in the Data Science process. Let\u2019s look at them briefly one by one.\n\nModelling is like the heart of Data Science. It uses Machine Learning algorithms to transform data into actionable insights. In this step, Data Scientists will select and train models. These models will then be tuned to achieve optimal performance.\n\nNow, let me tell you about the next step i.e. the evaluation process. It ensures that the model is performing well on both trained and untrained data. You might not know this, but various metrics are also used in this step.\n\nFor example, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score are used to measure the effectiveness of a model.\n\nFinally comes the deployment process. In this process, the model is integrated into real-world systems. It enables automated predictions and decision-making. It ensures that the project gives value and enables ongoing improvements.\n\nHow Machine Learning Optimises Each Step\n\nNow, in this section, I\u2019m going to tell you how Machine Learning is revolutionising each step of the Data Science process. I\u2019m going to tell you how ML improves efficiency and accuracy at every stage. Without further ado, let\u2019s get started.\n\nAutomating Data Preprocessing and Cleaning\n\nAlthough data preprocessing is a crucial step in Data Science, it\u2019s also a time-consuming process. Machine Learning algorithms play the magic here by simplifying this process. ML algorithms automate tasks like missing value imputation and outlier detection. Not only this, but data normalisation is also automated by these algorithms.\n\nFor instance, Machine Learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) estimate missing values based on patterns in the data. On the other hand, clustering algorithms identify and handle outliers in the data.\n\nMoreover, advanced tools like AutoML streamline feature scaling and encoding. It makes sure that your data is ready for analysis. Thus, all this automation helps in reducing manual work and improving the quality of input data. Thus, it directly impacts the reliability of downstream models.\n\nEnhancing EDA with ML-Driven Insights\n\nAs I\u2019ve previously mentioned, EDA helps in uncovering trends and correlations in data sets. It also helps you with finding anomalies in the data. The traditional EDA process uses visualisation and basic statistics. But here, Machine Learning takes it one step further.\n\nIf used, unsupervised Machine Learning techniques will be very fruitful. For instance, techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) find dominant patterns. On the other hand, clustering algorithms will reveal natural groupings in the data.\n\nDo you know that ML-powered tools can also generate automated insights? These tools will highlight relationships in the data that might not be immediately noticed. Thus, ML enhances the EDA process and allows Data Scientists to focus on strategic problem-solving instead of manual exploration.\n\nImproving Prediction Accuracy and Model Selection\n\nYou might be surprised to know how Machine Learning improves prediction accuracy. To make this work, it uses advanced algorithms like ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and neural networks.\n\nAutoML frameworks are used to analyse multiple models. It also evaluates the model\u2019s performance and recommends the best one for the task. Besides this, hyperparameter tuning using ML techniques is used to ensure more optimal performance. Thus, Machine Learning maximises the model\u2019s predictive power with minimal manual intervention by streamlining model selection and optimisation.\n\nWrapping up\n\nData Science is making innovations daily, and Machine Learning plays an important role in this process. Machine Learning algorithms and techniques are used in every stage of the Data Science process. It automates repetitive tasks, enhances the EDA process and improves the prediction accuracy of the model.\n\nIn fact, the Data Science field is booming as of now and generating many career opportunities for individuals. Salaries are also lucrative for those who have the right knowledge and skills. It is high time for you to learn Data Science now. You will be surprised to know that you can also learn Data Science for free.\n\nI highly recommend you to join Pickl.AI as it offers one of the best free Data Science courses for beginners and professionals.

            "article_content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Apple\u2019s new Enhanced Visual Search in Photos uses machine learning to recognize things like landmarks.\n\nThe service works by sharing encrypted data from your pictures with Apple, and includes privacy safeguards.\n\nSome users are still concerned that Enhanced Visual Search is enabled by default, rather than having you opt in.\n\nThere are a million different ways to think about privacy, evaluating the balance between how much of it we want to cede, and what benefits we get for doing so. With our devices, and our increasing reliance on AI tools like machine learning, a convenient line to draw when making such evaluations is that between processes that occur fully locally, and those that require working on data remotely in the cloud. Right now, Apple users are raising the alarm about the privacy implications of the new Enhanced Visual Search in Photos, and the data it shares with Apple by default.\n\nOver the weekend, software engineer Jeff Johnson got this ball rolling by sharing his concerns about the presence of a new Enhanced Visual Search option that appears in both iOS 18 and on macOS 15 (via 91mobiles). The tool attempts to add value to your photos by identifying stuff like landmarks, matching elements of their construction with a database Apple\u2019s compiled. Apple describes the feature and outlines its privacy practices as such: Enhanced Visual Search in Photos allows you to search for photos using landmarks or points of interest. Your device privately matches places in your photos to a global index Apple maintains on our servers. We apply homomorphic encryption and differential privacy, and use an OHTTP relay that hides IP address. This prevents Apple from learning about the information in your photos. While the company goes on to provide instructions for turning Enhanced Visual Search off, Johnson is quick to point out that this service comes enabled by default on both iOS and macOS. That means that unless you take positive steps to the contrary, information from the pictures you shoot will end up being sent to Apple.\n\nNow, before we start getting too paranoid here, it\u2019s clear that Apple is taking some legitimate steps to mitigate the possible privacy impact. The homomorphic encryption the company mentions, for instance, means that this is a system that allows Apple\u2019s cloud servers to work on your data while it\u2019s still encrypted, rather than having to decrypt it (and potentially expose private location details) first.\n\nEven if we\u2019re to assume that system works flawlessly, some users are just not going to be comfortable having a tool like this involve sending their data to the cloud. But what feels like the greater offense may be the way it\u2019s been enabled for everyone by default, rather than asking user to opt in.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure about Enhanced Visual Search and would rather just turn it off, you can find the toggle under Photos settings on your iPhone or in General settings on Macs.\n\nGot a tip?

Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 189 Ukrainian prisoners, including military personnel, border guards and national guards \u2014 along with two civilians \u2014 were freed. He thanked the UAE for helping negotiate the exchange.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that 150 Russian soldiers were freed from captivity as part of the exchange in which each side released 150 people.\n\nThe reason for the discrepancy in numbers wasn\u2019t immediately clear.\n\n\u201cWe are working to free everyone from Russian captivity,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a statement. \u201cWe do not forget anyone.\u201d He posted pictures of Ukrainian soldiers sitting on a bus, some holding the country\u2019s blue-and-yellow flags.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZelenskyy said that those freed from Russian captivity included defenders of the Snake Island off the Black Sea port of Odesa, which was seized by Russia in the opening days of its invasion, as well as troops who defended the city of Mariupol, that was captured by Moscow\u2019s forces early in the war after a nearly three-month siege.\n\n\u201cThe return of our people from Russian captivity is always very good news for each of us,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cAnd today is one of those days: our team managed to return 189 Ukrainians home.\u201d\n\nIn Moscow, the Defense Ministry said that Russian servicemen were first taken to the territory of Russia\u2019s neighbor and ally Belarus, where they received \u201cpsychological and medical assistance\u201d before moving to Russia.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have conducted dozens of such prisoner exchanges during the nearly three-year war."

            "article_content": "In the ferocious civil war between ethnic rebel groups and the junta (military) in Myanmar, the Arakan Army, the biggest of all the rebel groups, is now in control of large parts of the Rakhine province. The security dynamics along Myanmar's border with Bangladesh have considerably altered in the second week of December as the junta lost control over the area.\n\nThis uncertainty is bound to have a spillover effect along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, raising concerns of a fresh wave of Rohingya refugees attempting to escape the region. Myanmar has been consumed by civil war after the military coup in 2021, which ousted the democratically-run government.\n\nFor the world grappling with wars in Europe and West Asia, Myanmar's strife is forgotten. Except as the looming reality for its neighbours, the world doesn't seem to remember the disastrous events unfolding within Myanmar and the volatile politics consuming it. India is closely watching the developments as there may be implications.\n\nWhy the continuing strife?\n\nDeprived of fair play, various ethnic armed organisations like the Arakan Army have been battling the military since independence for autonomy and control of beneficial resources.\n\nThe Arakan Army is part of the anti-junta group called Three Brotherhood Alliance (the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army are the other two). The same alliance had initiated an assault in October 2023, gaining several considerable wins along Myanmar's border with China.\n\nIn August this year, the alliance gained command of the north-eastern town of Lashio, indicating the first capture of a regional military command in Myanmar's history.\n\nThere are even reports that the Arakan Army now commands areas inside Bangladesh along the Myanmar-Bangladesh border and that may lead to a fight between Bangladesh Army and the Arakan Army and exacerbate the security crisis in the region.\n\nExperts say the Arakan Army operates as the military wing of the ULA (United League of Arakan), the political organisation of the Buddhist people in Myanmar's western Rakhine state.\n\nIn the last 15 months, the Arakan Army has gained ground, capturing dozens of townships and military outposts. The group's continuous capture of regions in its fold have raised questions about its motive.\n\nMyanmar has never recognised the Rohingya community residing in the Rakhine province as its citizens. In 2017, after a brutal crackdown on Rohingya villages by Myanmar's military, hundreds of thousands Rohingya fled across the border into neighbouring Bangladesh to escape the atrocities. India has faced an influx of Rohingya refugees since then.\n\nAs of now, keeping a larger picture of Rakhine province's autonomy, the Arakan Army wants to project the Rohingya as their own, but in the past, the organisation is known to have committed deadly atrocities against the community.\n\nHighlighting the events of the region, Sripathi Narayanan, foreign and security policy analyst, said, \"The Rohingya have been used as cannon fodder by both the junta and the rebels. Much of the supplies of the AA (Arakan Army) come from across the western border of Myanmar. The communities across the border also share fraternal ties with one another.\"\n\nIndia's interests\n\nIndia's attitude towards Myanmar has been mixed as it has been facing its own problems in the northeast, particularly in Manipur, for the past 20 months, and the arrival of Christian and Buddhist refugees from Myanmar have further complicated the issues.\n\nThere are fears about advanced weaponry in the hands of Myanmar's rebel groups reaching terrorist groups operating in India's northeastern states. Also, there are reports of Myanmar's rebel groups increasing drug trafficking activities to raise funds, which is another major concern for India.\n\nSensing the risks, the Centre recently tightened the rules for the movement of people from either side of the border in India and Myanmar. The new rules further restrict the movement of people from 16 km under the free movement regime (FMR) to 10 km now, on either side.\n\nA common trait of the ever-altering political scenario of India's neighbourhood - be it Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or Myanmar - is their growing reliance on China. This offers Beijing with chances to further contain India's influence in the Global South as a part of its known strategy.\n\nThe political turmoil in Myanmar and Bangladesh can be used by China to its advantage to foment further internal troubles in the northeastern border states of India.\n\nChina has been engaging with the junta and the rebel groups to derive the maximum protection of its own interests in Myanmar. Beijing has invested billions into the country's oil and gas sector, as well as other physical infrastructure. The Myanmar military controls Kyaukphyu, a major town in Rakhine state that is the terminus of a $1.5 billion oil pipeline and a parallel natural gas pipeline running to Kunming, the capital of the Yunnan province in southwestern China.\n\nThe pipelines are a major part of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, which is an important part of Beijing's ambitious BRI (Belt and Road Initiative).\n\nWith the help of the Arakan Army, China also wants to keep an eye on India's Kaladan project in Rakhine, which is meant to connect the Bay of Bengal with India's northeast. However, the Kaladan project, which entails building new port facilities at Sittwe (Rakhine province capital), a river transit system and a road to India's Mizoram state, seems to be delayed. It would have also reduced India's dependence on Bangladesh for its transit routes. Now, India may have to engage with the Arakan Army, a non-state actor, for starting the delayed project work.\n\nIndia is engaging both with the rebel group and the military government, and has initiated other diplomatic channels.\n\n\"In the past few months, India has started benign engagement with the rebel groups/EAOs (also called Ethnic Armed Organisations) in the regions bordering India because we want to keep our strategic interests of protecting the northeast region at priority,\" says Cchavi Vasisht, senior research associate, Chintan Research Foundation.\n\n\"We need to make further efforts to increase our engagements with AA. To protect our bordering areas as well as the Kaladan project which crosses through the Rakhine state,\" she adds.\n\nAs a way out, there is a need to facilitate dialogue between the rebel groups and junta for initiating an inclusive democratic process where all communities have a say. \"India has been vocalising its concerns with respect to Myanmar, it wants a smooth transition of the country into a federal and democratic setup,\" says Ms Vasisht."

            "article_content": "The big picture: A combination of buyer strategies and market conditions are expected to drive DRAM prices down across the board in the first quarter of 2025. As outlined in TrendForce's latest market report, PC OEMs accelerated inventory reduction efforts in Q4 2024. The strategy is expected to persist into the first quarter of next year, further suppressing bit procurement volumes.\n\nDDR4 price declines, in particular, are expected to accelerate due in part to sluggish consumer demand, increased production from Chinese suppliers, and low-priced chips flooding the market. As a result, PC DRAM prices are expected to drop by eight to 13 percent.\n\nServer DRAM pricing \u2013 both DDR4 and DDR5 \u2013 is expected to weaken in part because of slow seasonal demand. Manufacturers have also started shifting DDR4 capacity to DDR5 production, while others are moving HBM production to focus on DDR5. As a result, server DRAM prices as a whole could fall by five to 10 percent in Q1 as DDR4 price declines accelerate.\n\nMemory for mobile solutions and graphics products will also be impacted. Smartphone manufacturers have spent the past two quarters adjusting DRAM stockpiles, which will allow them to maintain a passive procurement strategy in Q1 2025 in hopes of attaining more favorable contract pricing. As such, TrendForce expects contract pricing for LPDDR4X and LPDDR5X to fall by eight to 13 percent and three to eight percent, respectively, in Q1 2025.\n\nGDDR7 stockpiling for next-gen GPUs will help graphics DRAM pricing but even still, broader DRAM market weakness and heightened inventories will impact the market. TrendForce expects to see graphics DRAM market prices decline by an average of five to 10 percent in Q1.\n\nRelated reading: Cheap vs. Premium DDR5: Stock vs. EXPO/XMP Memory\n\nFor the average consumer looking to pick up a new kit of DDR4 or DDR5 memory for a new build or an existing rig, now is a great time to do so. Prices are low and with post-holiday sales, you can save even more. This 32GB kit of G.Skill DDR4, for example, is under $50 over on Newegg."

Leading the way in implementing robust AWS auto-scaling strategies is Kiran Kumar Kakkireni, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Equinox IT Solutions LLC, and a seasoned DevOps and cloud engineer with over 12 years of experience.\n\n\u201cAuto-scaling is not just about adding or removing resources\u2014it\u2019s about aligning infrastructure with real-time demand to optimize cost and performance,\u201d Kiran explains. With expertise in AWS architecture and automation, Kiran has helped organizations worldwide build scalable, resilient, and efficient applications.\n\nWhat is AWS Auto-Scaling?\n\nAWS Auto-Scaling is a feature that dynamically adjusts compute capacity to match the current demand. It ensures that applications maintain high performance while optimizing costs by automatically scaling resources up or down based on pre-defined conditions.\n\nAccording to Kiran, \u201cAuto-scaling provides the flexibility businesses need to respond to unpredictable workloads without overprovisioning resources.\u201d\n\nKiran\u2019s Auto-Scaling Strategies for High Performance\n\nKiran\u2019s approach to AWS auto-scaling focuses on designing systems that are scalable, cost-efficient, and resilient. Here are his key strategies:\n\n1. Implementing Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)\n\nAuto Scaling Groups (ASGs) are the foundation of any auto-scaling strategy. They manage EC2 instances to ensure that the right amount of capacity is always available.\n\nBest Practice:\n\nConfigure ASGs with proper minimum, maximum, and desired instance counts.\n\nUse multiple availability zones for redundancy and high availability.\n\n2. Leveraging Scaling Policies\n\nScaling policies determine when and how the auto-scaling feature adjusts resources. Kiran emphasizes the importance of choosing the right policies:\n\nDynamic Scaling: Adjusts resources based on real-time demand metrics like CPU utilization or request count.\n\nPredictive Scaling: Uses machine learning to forecast demand and scale resources in advance.\n\n\u201cDynamic scaling is great for immediate needs, but predictive scaling offers a proactive approach to handle traffic spikes,\u201d Kiran advises.\n\n3. Combining Load Balancers with Auto-Scaling\n\nLoad balancers distribute incoming traffic across instances, ensuring that no single resource is overwhelmed. Kiran pairs auto-scaling with Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) to achieve optimal performance.\n\nBest Practice:\n\nUse Application Load Balancers (ALBs) for HTTP/HTTPS traffic.\n\nConfigure target groups to ensure that scaling actions are aligned with application health.\n\n4. Monitoring and Fine-Tuning Metrics\n\nAWS CloudWatch plays a pivotal role in monitoring application performance and identifying scaling triggers. \u201cThe key is to monitor the right metrics,\u201d Kiran notes.\n\nRecommended Metrics:\n\nCPU utilization\n\nMemory usage (using custom metrics)\n\nNetwork in/out\n\nApplication latency\n\n\u201cFine-tune scaling policies based on historical data to ensure they are neither too aggressive nor too conservative,\u201d he adds.\n\n5. Using Spot and Reserved Instances for Cost Efficiency\n\nKiran recommends combining auto-scaling with a mix of instance types to optimize costs:\n\nSpot Instances: Cost-effective for non-critical workloads.\n\nReserved Instances: Ideal for predictable, long-term workloads.\n\n\u201cThis hybrid approach ensures that businesses maximize cost savings without compromising performance,\u201d Kiran explains.\n\n6. Testing and Simulation\n\nBefore deploying auto-scaling in production, Kiran emphasizes the importance of testing strategies in staging environments.\n\nBest Practice:\n\nSimulate traffic spikes using load testing tools like Apache JMeter or AWS\u2019s Distributed Load Testing tool.\n\nValidate that scaling actions meet performance expectations.\n\nBenefits of Auto-Scaling\n\nBy implementing these strategies, Kiran has helped organizations achieve significant benefits, including:\n\nImproved Performance: Applications remain responsive under heavy traffic.\n\nCost Savings: Resources scale down during low-demand periods, reducing expenses.\n\nHigh Availability: Redundant instances in multiple availability zones ensure uptime.\n\n\u201cA well-designed auto-scaling strategy gives businesses the confidence to handle any workload, anytime,\u201d Kiran states.\n\nReal-World Success\n\nKiran recalls a notable success story: \u201cA global e-commerce client experienced a 300% increase in traffic during their annual sale. With predictive scaling and load balancing in place, their platform handled the surge seamlessly, with zero downtime and optimized costs.\u201d\n\nAs AWS continues to innovate, Kiran predicts that auto-scaling will become even more intelligent and customizable. \u201cAI-driven scaling decisions and tighter integrations with serverless architectures are the next big things,\u201d he says. \u201cThe future is about making scaling smarter and more efficient.\u201d\n\nFor businesses looking to harness the power of AWS auto-scaling, Kiran\u2019s expertise offers a roadmap to success. His strategies ensure that applications remain high-performing, cost-effective, and resilient in an ever-changing digital world.\n\nKiran Kumar Kakkireni is the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Equinox IT Solutions LLC, based in Dallas, Texas. With over 12 years of experience in DevOps, AWS architecture, and automation, Kiran specializes in helping businesses build scalable, secure, and cost-efficient cloud solutions. He is recognized as a thought leader in the cloud computing industry and a trusted advisor for digital transformation."

            "article_content": "Former President Jimmy Carter lived 100 years, and accomplished a lot around the world and locally in Georgia. While many will remember what he did professionally as a president or personally as a humanitarian, there are several fun facts and funny stories that some people may not know about.\n\nHere are 5 of the most interesting and bizarre ones:\n\nFILE - Former President Jimmy Carter works on a corbel at the start of the Habitat for Humanity build on Monday, Oct. 7, 2019. His work with the organization was a plot point on an episode of \"Home Improvement\" in which he had a cameo.\n\nJimmy Carter was on \"Home Improvement\"\n\nOne of the most popular sitcoms of the 1990's was \"Home Improvement,\" Tim Allen's first leading project. Carter had a brief cameo in season 3, episode 18. In the episode, Tim Allen's character Tim Taylor and his wife compete to see who can build a house faster as part of Habitat for Humanity, an organization Carter has been a longtime supporter of. Carter appears at the end of the episode in a televised message to the Taylors.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Tim...what can I say?\" Carter said. \"Crews are working around the clock to repair what you built.\"\n\nWant to watch the episode? It's available on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nCarter condolences: Donations to Carter Center encouraged in lieu of flowers. How you can honor Jimmy Carter\n\nFILE - A bouquet of flowers rests at the base of the Smiling Peanut on Monday February 20, 2023 in Plains, Georgia after former President Jimmy Carter went into hospice care. The 13-foot tall roadside attraction is a remnant of Jimmy Carter's 1976 Presidential campaign. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nSmiling Peanut\n\nA 13-foot tall \"Smiling Peanut\" statue was debuted in 1976 by the Indiana Democratic Party as a part of Carter's presidential campaign. It draws a connection between Georgia's iconic crop while bearing a smile reminiscent of Carter's. The peanut is made of solid foam sprayed over a series of metal hoops covered with chicken wire.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has moved around over the years, but today stands in Plains and currently stands at 120 Buena Vista Rd. What's even more interesting about this roadside attraction is a certain local legend: There's a hole in the back which was carved by the Secret Service to ensure there were no assassins or bombs hiding in the peanut.\n\nJimmy Carter saw a UFO\n\nOne of the longest-running, strange stories to surround Carter was the time he saw a UFO. While the exact dates of the sighting is unclear, the story goes that after a dinner more than 50 years ago, Carter said he and several other people saw something in the sky:\n\n\"A kind of green light appeared in the western sky. This was right after sundown. It got brighter and brighter. And then it eventually disappeared. It didn\u2019t have any solid substance to it, it was just a very peculiar looking light. None of us could understand what it was.\u201d\n\nCarter clarified in another interview years later that, while it was an unidentified flying object, he didn't necessarily mean a flying saucer or something similar.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It was unidentified as far as we were concerned, but I think it's impossible, in my opinion, some people may disagree, to have space people from other planets or other stars to come,\" he said.\n\nFILE - Jimmy Carter and Willie Nelson backstage at the Merriwether Post Pavilion in Maryland in 1980. Nelson and other musicians helped put Carter into the White House in 1976. Carter died on Sunday.\n\nJimmy Carter: \"Rock & Roll President\"\n\nAs Variety put it, Carter was remembered as the ultimate music-loving president. He was not only a huge fan of big names like the Allman Brothers and Bob Dylan, but they were also fans of his. The close relationship Carter had with music and musicians was the focus of a documentary called \"Jimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President\" (which you can watch on Max). In the documentary, Carter laughed as he revealed that when Willie Nelson came to stay at the White House, he smoked marijuana with one of his sons.\n\nCarter's awards: When did Jimmy Carter win the Nobel Peace Prize? Here\u2019s a look at 5 of his honors\n\nJimmy Carter missed out on being valedictorian\n\nWhen Carter was graduating from Plains High School in 1941, he was slated to be valedictorian but missed the chance because he skipped a day of classes. He reportedly went to see a movie on April Fool's Day in Americus with some other senior boys. Carter received zeroes for that day and became the salutatorian instead.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiguel Legoas is a Deep South Connect Team Reporter for Gannett/USA Today.

More info\n\nAn orange ball of light in the skies over a Scots town has been recorded on a database of potential UFO sightings.\n\nOne user took to the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) \u2013 a US-based non-profit organization composed of civilian volunteers who study reported UFO sightings \u2013 to share the details of the alleged sighting over Alva, Clackmannanshire, just days before Christmas.\n\nAccording to the report filed with the MUFON database, the person witnessed a \u201chuge bright object\u201d that moved slowly, from north to south.\n\nThe report on the database reads: \u201cOrange colour, regular ball. No sounds. No position lights \u2013 like red and green in a plane. Maybe 200-300-feet above ground level.\n\n\u201cVisible for minute or two at 11.23pm. Disappeared in a second. My son took a photo, but the camera was on 1 second exposure and you can\u2019t see a ball but a direction of movement.\u201d\n\nHowever no photo was published along with the report.\n\nThe sighting took place shortly before 11.30pm on Sunday, December 22, and was reported to MUFON two days later, on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe Forth Valley area has become a hotbed for UFO activity in recent years.\n\nIn June 2017, a Bannockburn woman claimed that she spotted a UFO that had left her unable to sleep at night. The then 42-year-old, who did not wish to be named, detail her jaw-dropping sighting in Hillpark, Bannockburn. She said: \u201cThe size of it was unreal. It was about 20ft away from and I\u2019d say it was about 100ft in diameter.\n\n\u201cEven if it was a military thing, why was it coming down a quiet street?\n\n\u201cI know it sounds crazy, but I would say it was a spaceship.\n\n\u201cI could see writing on the top of it as well, like Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\n\u201cIt has been a few sleepless nights for me since it.\u201d\n\nClick here for more news and sport from the Stirling area.\n\nIn September 2018, a video surfaced online apparently showing an unidentified aircraft on fire and in distress in the skies above Kippen. The video was posted by a Youtube channel titled UFO Today and was submitted by an anonymous female subscriber who lives near the village.\n\nThe video was captured on Saturday, September 1, 2018, after the woman heard a loud bang outside. She rushed to her balcony with her camera and she noticed what she described as \u201ca UFO flying erratically near a hill\u201d.\n\nIn the video, the object can be seen to be seemingly on fire, with flames and sparks emitting from it. The object was rapidly changing altitude and direction before tailing off and seemingly disappearing.\n\nIn October 2019, an eagle-eyed UFO hunter claimed to have seen the strange phenomenon over Stirling. The anonymous spotter noted that there had been fireworks being set off in the area around the time but said that the glowing object appeared in the sky for several minutes.\n\nIn the incident report of the sighting, they said: \u201cThere was also fireworks on at the time but the white kind of circle shapes (were) moving fast and diagonal, left and right, moving away fast and coming back to the spot in sky that was visible to this. (It) lasted about five minutes.\u201d\n\nJust days later, another man claimed to have seen mysterious lights in the sky just days after report The stargazer claims to have been on Tak Ma Doon Road, near to the Carron Valley Reservoir, when he and a friend spotted \u201cvery strange\u201d, quick moving white oval lights flying over head. He told how the lights moved without making a sound and said that they were \u201cmost definitely not any sort of thing that has been man-made\u201d.\n\nIn September 2020, a Dunblane man claimed to have come into close contact with a UFO in the town in a late-night encounter. The man, who did not wish to be identified, said that he was awoken in the dead of night by a bright, glowing light shining in his bedroom window. He had been fast asleep when he was roused at around 2am.\n\nHe said: \u201cI walked over to the window and looked out. I saw a bright white ball of light, which measured about 15 feet across. It couldn\u2019t have been any more than 15 feet from me. It made a low humming noise, but oddly there was absolutely no heat coming from it, which I thought was strange for something shining so bright.\u201d\n\nThe man, who has a background in engineering, says that the ball of light was soon joined by two others and they then set off, moving slowly, estimated to be around 5mph, over his house off in the direction of Doune.\n\nOn the bizarre encounter the man said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t particularly frightened, I was more interested in what I was seeing. I don\u2019t know exactly what it was, but it certainly seemed to have been being controlled.\u201d"

            "article_content": "People often wonder why bad things happen to good people. Or, why bad things happen at all, really.\n\nSome use this as part of their basis for atheism, saying that they don\u2019t understand why God would allow bad things to happen. Others have not let this deter them from seeking out and finding religion.\n\nBut, if these questions could be answered, wouldn\u2019t everyone feel at least a bit more satisfied?\n\nOne pastor thinks he knows why God doesn\u2019t stop bad things from happening.\n\nA man named Jeremy, who identified himself as \u201ca deep skeptic [and] also a pastor,\u201d believes that quantum physics holds the age-old answer to why God doesn\u2019t stop bad things from happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe shared his theory on TikTok.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pastor began by explaining the basics of quantum physics.\n\n\u201cSo we exist in four dimensions, which is really interesting \u2018cause most people think we exist in three dimensions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, uh, it\u2019s actually four, and Einstein may have been the first person to actually label it this way.\u201d\n\nJeremy said that those four dimensions consist of length, width, height, and time.\n\n\u201cBut Einstein said that our experience of time is interesting because we don\u2019t experience all of time; we just experience time as duration,\u201d he continued. \u201cAs, like, this progression from where we are to wherever we are next. So, he actually said that we exist in three and a half dimensions.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jeremy, each dimension builds on the previous one, which gives us the three-dimensional world that we know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJeremy admitted that this was \u201ca little nerdy\u201d and difficult to understand. After all, the average person did not take a quantum physics class in high school. But he promised that if you stuck with him, he would prove his point.\n\nThe pastor explained that the concept of time in quantum physics explains his theory.\n\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s just say that God occupies all of the four dimensions that we occupy and occupies them fully,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat means that God experiences all of time, as what one philosopher called an \u2018eternal now.\u2019 That everything in time is now to God. And so when God acts within those four dimensions, it actually is not acting in duration, but in all of them at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d Jeremy said, \u201cthat you can\u2019t use terms like before or after with God. Terms like before or after don\u2019t make sense because God doesn\u2019t experience time as duration in this sort of philosophical framework.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJESHOOTS.com | Pexels\n\nBasically, what Jeremy meant was that we experience time as \u201cduration\u201d or how we get from point A to point B. God does not. Instead, he experiences it all at once. It is all \u201cnow\u201d to him.\n\n\u201cSo when you think about that question, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t God stop bad things from happening?\u2019 it\u2019s very much related to time, right?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, why did God not act before this thing happened? But when you talk about God existing in all the dimensions, there is no before, there is no after with God. God is experiencing the eternal now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is, quite frankly, all really confusing.\n\nCould this be an answer to why God doesn\u2019t stop bad things from happening? It\u2019s possible. Then again, it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s just the ramblings of someone who\u2019s a little too geeky for their own good.\n\nAs for the Biblical perspective, Pastor William L. Kynes, the Senior Fellow for Pastoral Theology at the C.S. Lewis Institute, wrote, \u201cThough we can never give a full explanation of evil in this world, we do have God\u2019s response to it.\u201d\n\n@ashleyhetherington to the girl who may be wondering why God is allowing this to happen\u2728\ud83d\udc97#christiantiktok #relatable #christiangirl #jesus #christian #bibleverse #bibleverse #gospel #trending #motivation #viral #God #dailybible #fyp #Godisgood #testimony \u266c original sound- ashley hetherington\n\nKynes cited the scripture Revelation 21:4, which says in part, \u201cHe will wipe every tear from their eyes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s quite possible that there are some things we will simply never understand, although we try to make sense of it.\n\nMary-Faith Martinez is a writer with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English and Journalism who covers news, psychology, lifestyle, and human interest topics."

            "article_content": "Photo: VCG\n\nThroughout the year of 2024, there has been no shortage of posts and videos on social media platforms by bloggers from home or abroad, sharing how they were captivated by China's surging scientific revolution tide, ranging from real-time food delivery by hotel room service robots, driverless artificial intelligent (AI) robots delivering parcels to spherical robots patrolling the street side by side with police officers.In a recent milestone, a group of four-legged \"Made in China\" robotic dogs, designed for tunnel inspections and maintenance tasks, have been put on duty and are now operating in a 6-kilometer underground power tunnel inspection project in Singapore - the first overseas deployment of a Chinese robotic solution in such an application scenario.These unique creatures have wooed thousands of netizens after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian shared a video of them on social media in mid-December, calling them \"cool.\"The \"cool\" wave of the tech revolution has been unlocking more exciting possibilities across multiple Chinese industries in 2024, a year that is deemed critical for the rapid advancement of China's robotics technology. It, in a broader picture, underscored the explosive progress of new quality productive forces -an emerging key term in China's economic and social axis that is playing an expanding role in driving the country's high-quality development.A walk-in into manufacturing bases across various Chinese localities also provides insights into how the development of new quality productive forces has been transforming traditional industries while injecting new impetus into driving the country's industrial upgrade.To date, a flurry of auto-makers and logistics providers including Geely, BAIC New Energy, and SF Express have been integrating humanoid robots, considered at the forefront of the development of new quality productive forces, into their facilities, the Global Times learned from Hong Kong-listed UBTech Robotics. These robots are being trialed on factory floors to perform tasks like assembly, transportation, testing, and maintenance, making remarkable progress in automation and industrial efficiency improvement in the world's second-largest economy.In December, the just-concluded Central Work Economic Conference set priorities for economic work in 2025, including ensuring that scientific and technological innovation drives the development of new quality productive forces and builds a modernized industrial system.As China is steadily marching toward the 15th Five-Year Plan period (2026-30), industry insiders expect that the development of new quality productive forces will serve as a cornerstone of China's long-term strategic vision in the face of a more complicated geopolitical landscape, rising protectionism and global tech supply chain \"decoupling.\" Meanwhile, China's build-up of a host of emerging industries like AI and 5G would also create a new type of global supply and value chains that injects strong momentum and brings more development opportunities to the Global South, analysts stressed.During this year's national two sessions in March, the phrase new quality productive forces has become a buzzword among Chinese officials, national lawmakers, and political advisors, with \"developing new quality productive forces at a faster pace\" listed among the major tasks for 2024 in the Government Work Report for the first time.More elaborations on the concept, as well as detailed plans and coordinating measures, were released in follow-ups, further highlighting its profound ramifications in the country's economic policymaking and future development course.In early December, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee held a meeting to analyze and study the economic work of 2025, during which it was noted that new quality productive forces have developed steadily this year.According to industry insiders, scientific and technological innovation is the core of the new quality productive forces. In this regard, China has achieved numerous monumental milestones in sci-tech innovation this year in a variety of sectors, such as semiconductor, quantum computing, telecom technology, AI, low-altitude economy, biomedicine, new energy, and large aircraft manufacturing.It is important to sustain this homegrown technological climb-up momentum, according to analysts, and they expect the 15th Five-year Plan (2026-2030) to continue prioritizing the development of new quality productive forces, listing it as both an urgent task and a long-term vision.Pan Helin, a member of the Expert Committee for the Information and Communication Economy under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, told the Global Times that the accumulation of these technological edges is crucial to fueling China's ongoing industrial transformation and upgrading. It is also conducive to the formation of new economic drivers and new business models, which are all decisive elements in buttressing China's high-quality development course in the years to come.The accelerated efforts in the development of new quality productive forces also come as Western countries show no sign of retreating from technological suppression against China.Against the backdrop, industry insiders called for more inputs in independent innovation and a strong spirit of self-reliance in core technologies, so that the country will be less vulnerable to any malicious attempts to curb its development and will have a greater say in international technological standard-setting.In terms of humanoid robots which integrate a wide range of cutting-edge full-stack AI technologies, Chinese players may start late as the technology and products were initially developed in countries like the US and Japan a decade ago. But this year, Chinese humanoid robot companies have achieved remarkable innovations, establishing themselves as global leaders in both robot products and applications, UBTech Robotics told the Global Times.The Government Work Report delivered in March 2024 stressed that China will pool the country's strategic scientific and technological strength and non-governmental innovation resources to make breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields and step up research on disruptive and frontier technologies.Highlighting the country's institutional advantage, Hua Rongqi, a Beijing-based AI entrepreneur, told the Global Times that China is perhaps the most efficient in mobilizing resources nationwide to enhance its capacity for innovation across the board. He said that this advantage is particularly palpable in the generative AI industry which is in a white-hot global race.At the same time, China excels in applying these technologies to real-world scenarios, and also is home to the world's most efficient and cost-effective supply chain alongside a deep pool of talent, which will all propel the development of new quality productive forces, Hua added.Zhou Hongyi, founder and chairman of 360 Security Technology, told the Global Times that China's stepped-up efforts are poised to make greater contributions to global technological progress and economic development, with its innovation-driven development model offering valuable experience for other countries to draw upon.\"On the one hand, industrial digitalization will create more new business models and growth dynamics, thereby generating great opportunities for global investors to tap into the country's expanding market. On the other hand, more and more countries will show great interest in engaging with technological cooperation taking account of China's growing technological prowess,\" Zhou explained.Chinese industries related to the development of new quality productive forces have increasingly risen to become a magnet to foreign investors this year.In the first 11 months, foreign direct investment in the country's high-tech manufacturing reached 82.53 billion yuan, accounting for 11 percent of the national total, data released by the Ministry of Commerce showed.According to UBTech Robotics, China's fast-lane development of new quality productive forces has also elevated the global standing and influence of Chinese enterprises and rendered them with more business opportunities in the global market. The company to date has collaborated with local partners to apply robotics solutions in countries such as Thailand, Dubai, South Korea, Japan, and Germany.Huang Lingxiao, overseas marketing manager of DEEP Robotics, the Chinese company that provides robotic dogs for tunnel maintenance tasks in Singapore, told the Global Times on Thursday that as developed nations like Singapore upgrade their industrial infrastructure through automation and digitization, this creates enormous opportunities for innovative solutions from Chinese robotics companies."
