        "article_content": "Amid the political spectacle of the election, former President Donald Trump appeared on Joe Rogan\u2019s popular podcast and spoke about UFOs. According to Trump, Air Force pilots told him how mysterious spherical objects outperformed one of the most advanced fighter jets America has.\n\nSimilar accounts date back to at least the 1940s. More recently, military encounters with spherical objects and other unknown craft that exhibit seemingly extraordinary capabilities generated a series of eyebrow-raising headlines.\n\nBut a host of other, ostensibly credible UFO-related allegations is even more remarkable.\n\nLast month, Kirk McConnell, a recently retired 37-year veteran professional staff member on the congressional armed services and intelligence committees, confirmed publicly that whistleblowers provided firsthand testimony to Congress alleging the existence of ultra-secret programs that retrieve and seek to reverse engineer advanced craft of unknown or non-human origin.\n\nMcConnell is not alone. He joins Sen Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence; former House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wisc.); and ex-intelligence official David Grusch, who have all stated publicly that individuals with firsthand knowledge have confirmed the existence of such efforts to Congress or to the internal watchdog that oversees America\u2019s spy agencies.\n\nSuch remarkable statements provide important context for what is arguably the most extraordinary legislation ever proposed in Congress.\n\nIntroduced by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Disclosure Act defines \u201cnon-human intelligence,\u201d \u201ctechnologies of unknown origin\u201d and \u201clegacy program.\u201d\n\nAs characterized in the bipartisan Disclosure Act, \u201clegacy program\u201d refers to any \u201cendeavors to collect, exploit, or reverse engineer technologies of unknown origin or examine biological evidence of living or deceased non-human intelligence.\u201d The term \u201cnon-human intelligence\u201d appears two dozen times throughout the 64-page legislation.\n\nThe Disclosure Act would also require the U.S. government to take possession of \u201cany and all\u201d recovered UFOs and \u201cbiological evidence of non-human intelligence\u201d transferred to private defense contractors.\n\nIn an extraordinary exchange with Rounds on the Senate floor, Schumer stated that \u201cmultiple credible sources\u201d have alleged that elements of the U.S. government have illegally withheld information on UFOs from Congress.\n\nOf equal importance, key members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, in tandem with other seemingly credible sources, have indicated that some of America\u2019s rivals may also have retrieved technologies of unknown origin.\n\nIf, for example, China and Russia have recovered such highly advanced technology, the profound geopolitical implications \u2014 including enormous risks to global security and stability \u2014 must be addressed proactively and without delay.\n\nAt the same time, according to investigative reporter Michael Shellenberger, a new, unnamed whistleblower provided a detailed report to Congress describing a secret government program to \u201cdetect, quarantine, and transfer\u201d observations of UFOs by the military\u2019s most advanced sensors to a secret database.\n\nDubbed \u201cImmaculate Constellation,\u201d the alleged program serves simultaneously as a master repository of radar, infrared, satellite and other UFO observations from sensitive sensor platforms, as well as an internal security process for keeping such data outside of normal military and intelligence communications channels.\n\nIf ultra-sensitive UFO data is indeed isolated and sequestered in such a secret database, it may, for example, explain how the Pentagon\u2019s UFO analysis office can plausibly claim that it has received very little truly anomalous data.\n\nAt the same time, virtually every former living president, along with a bipartisan cohort of former CIA chiefs, ex-directors of national intelligence and top military officials, has made astounding statements about UFOs in recent years.\n\nFormer CIA Director John Brennan, for example, stated in late 2020 that a \u201cdifferent form of life\u201d may be behind recent military UFO incidents. Six months later, former director of national intelligence John Ratcliffe said that UFOs exhibit technologies \u201cthat we don\u2019t have and, frankly, that we are not capable of defending against.\u201d\n\nMoreover, a series of brazen incursions around sensitive military facilities \u2014 including nuclear missile silos \u2014 by objects exhibiting seemingly advanced capabilities has left the U.S. government thoroughly baffled.\n\nNotably, by displaying bright flashing lights and flying in various formations, these objects are operating with seemingly brazen impunity around key military assets. Regardless of the nature of these incursions \u2014 be they bizarrely theatrical foreign intelligence gathering operations or otherwise \u2014 Congress must demand answers from the military and intelligence community.\n\nWith the House and Senate both slated to conduct UFO-related hearings in November, Congress has its work cut out for it. At a bare minimum, the sweeping government transparency and disclosure measures mandated by the Disclosure Act make it must-pass legislation.\n\nMarik von Rennenkampff served as an analyst with the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, as well as an Obama administration appointee at the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

By the way, the U.S Embassy,' as Elizondo told attendees at the paid event, gesturing to the photo: 'That.'\n\n\"'There's a whole lot more here folks.\n\n\"We're having pilots, military pilots and civilian pilots in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East, report what unimaginably seems impossible\n\n\"I just want to give you kind of a small taste of what's going on \"behind the scenes.\"\"\n\nThe startling claim directly links the U.S government to a deliberate alien cover-up, that he was exposing at the bizarre presentation.\n\nLUIS' CLAIMS HAVE DRAWN STRONG BACKLASH\n\nThese claims have drawn intense speculation from critics.\n\nVeteran US Air Force Staff Sergeant, Jeremy McGowan, witnessed a sensational UFO encounter in the Middle East decades ago.\n\nDespite this, he has cast strong doubt on Luis' credibility.\n\nJeremy said: \"This unfortunate situation with Lue follows my experiences with him nearly exactly.\n\n\"I witnessed him exaggerate or outright fabricate information that simply wasn't true.\n\n\"I've been on the receiving end where Lue has pulled out his cell phone and shown me what he described as highly classified video.\n\n\"For him to think I would believe he would simply carry classified info on an unsecure civilian cell phone is just insulting.\n\n\"And it wasn't just me, multiple podcast hosts were shown video Lue attributed to things they were not.\"\n\nIn the mid-90s, while serving as a member of the JSOC J2 Security Team for \"Ellipse Foxtrot,\" Jeremy says he was a witness to unusual aerial lights.\n\nAccording to reports, tickets to Luis' revelatory event at The City Winery, a Pennsylvania wine bar, cost between $30-$50 (\u00a323-38).\n\nCRITICS THINK THEY HAVE FOUND THE TRUTH\n\nIt did not take long for other internet sleuths to poke holes in Luis' outlandish statements.\n\nJohn Greenewald Jr, a government transparency advocate, tracked the photo back to September 2023, in a Facebook group called \"Mysterious Ancient Discoveries\".\n\nThis pic appears more likely to have originated as the reflection of an indoor chandelier reflected in window glass.\n\nThe Facebook picture has over 180,000 likes and 23,000 comments, suggesting the public were aware of the snap.\n\nFurther examination of the pic allegedly showed that it was not actually linked to the U.S Embassy, as Luis claimed.\n\nThe photo background appeared to show the Arad Power Station, a coal-fired plant.\n\nAmerica's Embassy is roughly 400 miles to the southeast of Arad, and is actually placed in the capital city Bucharest.\n\nLUIS HAS MORE EVENTS SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER\n\nOn October 30, two days after his paid event, Luis clarified that any misinformation involved in his presentation was the fault of his \"friend in the government\" who reportedly supplied the image.\n\nLuis has been criticised by the UFO community, who have accused him of using them as pawns in a money-making scheme.\n\nOne Reddit on the forum e/UFOs, one user remarked, \u201cLue is 100% using us as pawns to line his pockets.\n\n\"His most recent book was no.1 seller in the nation.\"\n\nAccording to Luis' X account, he has five more speaking engagements lined up for November.\n\nThe tagline on the promotional poster reads \"WE ARE NOT ALONE\".\n\n4 The Facebook group \"Mysterious Ancient Discoveries\" where critics think the pic was actually taken from Credit: Facebook"

        "article_content": "Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET\n\nAnthropic is expanding its Claude AI beyond the web. On Thursday, the company unveiled new desktop applications for its popular chatbot. Designed for Windows and MacOS, the new apps work similarly to the website and are available for free users and paid subscribers.\n\nTo grab the apps, head to the Claude for Desktop site, where you'll find versions for Windows, Windows on ARM, and MacOS. For now, the apps are tagged with a beta label, which may indicate that Anthropic is still tweaking them. After downloading one of the apps, you'll be prompted to sign in using a Google account or an email link. From there, use Claude just as you would use the website.\n\nAlso: How Claude's new AI data analysis tool compares to ChatGPT's version (hint: it doesn't)\n\nAsk a question. Submit a request. Start a conversation. You can ask Claude to analyze or summarize different types of files that you upload, including images, Microsoft Office files, PDFs, text files, HTML files, and code files.\n\nYou're able to access your chat history to view and resume a previous conversation. The Windows and Mac apps sync with the website and mobile apps, so you'll find the same conversation history across the board. Plus, you can view your profile settings and account and billing details.\n\nClaude is also sporting a new dictation mode. Accessible only from the Claude AI mobile apps for iOS/iPadOS and Android, the dictation feature lets you speak your request instead of typing it. This is always a handy option, especially if you don't like having to tap out lengthy prompts on a mobile device. Using dictation mode, you can carry on a real-time conversation with Claude and even respond to questions from the AI.\n\nTo try dictation, just tap the microphone icon, speak, and then tap the X button to stop. Claude displays its response on the screen. To continue the conversation, just tap the microphone icon again and dictate another question or request.\n\nLooking to challenge other AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini, Anthropic has been on a tear trying to fine-tune and expand Claude.\n\nAlso: I tested this viral AI image generator, and it does text well - finally! Try it for free\n\nThe company recently released a new model of Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Currently in beta mode for developers to use via an API, the new version can interact with a computer by looking at the screen, moving the cursor, clicking buttons, and entering text via a virtual keyboard.\n\nIn August, Anthropic kicked off a feature known as Artifacts. Available to free and paid users on the website, the mobile apps, and the new desktop apps, Artifacts can help you create a website, a page of code, a visual presentation, or another project by displaying the results in real time right next to your conversation."

The app offers \"Nowcasting\" precipitation guesses, like \"Rain continuing for 2 hours\" or \"Light rain in 10 minutes.\"\n\nCredit: Kevin Purdy\n\nThe best feature, one seen on the version of Weather that shipped to the Pixel Tablet and Fold, is that you can rearrange the order of data shown on your weather screen. I moved the UV index, humidity, sunrise/sunset, and wind conditions as high as they could go on my setup. It's a trade-off, because the Weather app's data widgets are so big as to require scrolling to get the full picture of a day, and you can't move the AI summary or 10-day forecast off the top. But if you only need a few numbers and like a verbal summary, it's handy.\n\nSadly, if you're an allergy sufferer and you're not in the UK, Germany, France, or Italy, Google can't offer you any pollen data or forecasts. There is also, I am sad to say, no frog.\n\nGoogle's Weather app isn't faring so well with Play Store reviewers. Users are miffed that they can't see a location's weather without adding it to their saved locations list; that other Google apps, including the \"At a Glance\" app on every Pixel's default launcher, send you to the Google app's summary instead of this app; the look of the weather map; and, most of all, that it does not show up in some phones' app list, but only as a widget."

        "article_content": "OSHKOSH (NBC 26) \u2014 The Oshkosh Paranormal Society is a group of lifelong ghost enthusiasts who want to use their passion to help people. They\u2019ve carried out dozens of ghost investigations in the Oshkosh area.\n\n\n\nThose in the Oshkosh Paranormal Society have had a lifelong passion for ghosts\n\nThe group measures electricity and energy to communicate with spirits.\n\nThe Oshkosh Paranormal Society hopes to help people find peace of mind with death.\n\nIngrid Lemke says her first encounter with a spirit was early in her childhood.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a preteen, I had seen a shadow figure, and it just really terrified me,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like it was hovering over me.\u201d\n\nSince the incident, Lemke says she has had a sort of \u201csixth sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in my day, they thought you were insane, so I only told my friends,\u201d she says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until her adulthood that Lemke would find a large group of like-minded people and create what is now the Oshkosh Paranormal Society.\n\nLemke says it was validating finding others with a similar connection to ghosts and spirits.\n\n\u201cIt feels wonderful, it feels freeing,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Oshkosh Paranormal Society started as a group of Lemke and her coworkers, but now is a large Facebook group.\n\nMany in the group also had paranormal experiences as children.\n\n\u201cI think I was about eight,\u201d Emily Kampmann, a member of the group, says. \u201cI kind of woke up on the floor one day in my bedroom, and I was staring at my closet\u2026. and the door was wide open and there was glowing lights, like eyeballs staring at me. I know it sounds silly.\u201d\n\nThe group gets together to do paranormal investigations in haunted areas around Oshkosh. They\u2019ve investigated the local cemetery, The Grand Oshkosh, the Algoma Club and multiple personal homes.\n\nLemke says the downtown area near the Algoma Club and the Grand Oshkosh seem to be particularly haunted, which she believes is due to Oshkosh\u2019s two 19th century fires.\n\n\u201cOur investigations are generally scientific,\u201d Lemke says.\n\nThe group relies on different types of instruments and tools to pick up on energy shifts in the air. Some of the tools are used by electricians to track electricity.\n\n\u201cSo the theory is that spirits are energy, so when they get close to that, it triggers it,\u201d Jason Tiffany, a member of the group, says.\n\nThey also use recording devices to pick up on voices they wouldn\u2019t normally hear.\n\nLemke says they find a lot of evidence after the investigation ends and they\u2019re able to rewatch the footage.\n\n\u201cIt takes many hours,\u201d Lemke says.\n\nThe Algoma Club in Oshkosh was a speakeasy during prohibition, and Lemke says they\u2019ve found lots of evidence of prohibition-era spirits roaming the space.\n\n\"It's definitely a heavy presence,\" Lilly Heft, another member of the group says of the Algoma Club. \"I feel spooky in here.\"\n\nDespite the many hours that go into each investigation, the group says they are always fun.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s an adrenaline rush, but it kind of is,\u201d Heft says.\n\nHeft says she\u2019s a \u201chardcore believer\u201d in ghosts, but that\u2019s not true for everyone in the group.\n\n\u201cIf you hear a voice, you know, understanding that, is that your brain just trying to figure out what\u2019s going on?\" Stephanie Whittaker, another member of the group says. \u201cYou can\u2019t just, well for me anyways, you can\u2019t just let your imagination run away with you.\u201d\n\nWhittaker says she\u2019s a \u201cskeptic,\u201d and often questions the evidence the group collects. Still, there are some findings that she says are hard to deny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve, with the group, had enough experiences that I can\u2019t explain,\u201d she says.\n\nMore than the thrill of finding ghosts, the Oshkosh Paranormal Society hopes to use its passion to help people.\n\n\u201cMy favorite aspect of our group is when we help people in their personal houses,\u201d Lemke says. \u201cBecause they\u2019ve felt like I did when I was a kid\u2014 who do I reach out to? Who do I trust with this? I know how that feels not having any validation.\u201d\n\nLemke says she\u2019s helped expel angry spirits from homes, as well as give people the confirmation that they\u2019re not imagining things.\n\nFor Kampmann, she thinks the group can help on a deeper level\u2014 giving comfort around death.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really neat to experiment with that and show people that there is life after death in some form, to not be like somewhat scared of death even,\u201d she says.\n\nMore information on the group can be found on their Facebook page.\n\n"

We could all hear it, a creepy deep voice - it was totally inappropriate.\"\n\nSarah gave more details about what this inappropriate ghost apparently did, describing the whole interaction as 'weird'.\n\n\"Lee had forewarned me that entities can be aggressive towards women - I was just asking him normal questions when it happened,\" she explained.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"He said a lot of seedy things, and I felt really uncomfortable.\n\n\"We\u2019ve got this camera with sensors, and it picked up that there was a figure there, bending down and miming sexual actions toward me.\"\n\nTogether they run a museum of haunted objects, and Lee reckons that paranormal activity has increased because of all the spooky stuff they've put together (PA Real Life)\n\nThe couple say that in their haunted museum objects go flying mysteriously and the CCTV cameras move by themselves, with Lee getting new cameras just to watch the old ones moving.\n\nAdvert\n\nSarah said one of the first things she witnessed at Lee's place was a microwave meal flipping over when there was 'no one else around'.\n\nShe said: \"There\u2019s a very dark, horrible energy, and things have started happening all over the house.\n\n\"One evening, the door was locked and it sounded like someone was trying to open it, but no one was outside.\n\n\"It was terrifying. Things like this still make me jump, but Lee is more inquisitive and wants to investigate it.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThe couple reckons that all the haunted stuff they've bought might have something to do with it, with Lee saying that since they acquired the conjuring lamp of Aleister Crowley the paranormal activity has definitely increased."

Listen to this article using the player above. \u2716\n\nRead time: 1 minute\n\nMost patients may continue to safely take glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists as prescribed before undergoing elective surgery and gastrointestinal endoscopies, according to new clinical guidance released today by five surgical and medical societies including the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), International Society of Perioperative Care of Patients with Obesity (ISPCOP), and Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe guidance, published online in Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (SOARD), Surgical Endoscopy, and Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, however cautioned that patients at high risk for significant gastrointestinal side effects should follow a liquid diet for 24 hours before a procedure and the anesthesia plan be adjusted accordingly. In rare cases, the procedure should be delayed.\n\nWant more breaking news? Subscribe to Technology Networks\u2019 daily newsletter, delivering breaking science news straight to your inbox every day.

On the other hand, withholding medication so patients can have surgery may be even riskier, prompting the new guidance. It is also important to note that the risk of delayed gastric emptying decreases over time for most patients on these medications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur goal is to heighten awareness of a potential safety issue to prevent it,\u201d said Ann M. Rogers, MD, President, ASMBS, the largest society for metabolic and bariatric surgeons in the United States. \u201cIn most cases, patients can continue to take the drugs, however, individual risk factors for complications should be assessed prior to surgery before moving forward.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe authors wrote, \u201cthe purpose of this clinical practice guide is to offer unified, multi-society guidance for safely managing patients needing GLP-1RA therapy regardless of indication, which currently includes type 2 diabetes, overweight and obesity, and heart failure, during the periprocedural period.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Kindel TL, Wang AY, Wadhwa A, et al.

        "article_content": "As India continues its rapid development and is set to become a USD 7 trillion economy by 2030, businesses face immense pressure to innovate quickly and operate more efficiently than ever before. Due to the current demand to outpace competitors and respond quickly to customers, businesses today operate in a hyper-evolving environment with the need for rapid innovation, increased agility, and real-time customer care.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhen it comes to the application development process, for many years, only two options were available to organizations: purchasing ready-made solutions off the shelf or employing skilled programmers to create solutions from scratch. This has changed with the introduction of low-code/no-code (LCNC) development platforms that have revolutionized how businesses develop applications by making the process easy and more available to a wider section of the workforce These platforms can lead to cost reductions of up to 70% compared to traditional application development methods. In fact, a recent survey from Gartner indicates that by 2025, 87% of new applications developed by enterprises will use low-code or no-code technologies.\n\nLCNC platforms have changed the traditional development approach that could only be implemented by technical users. Now, both technical and non-technical users are able to make applications without additional coding knowledge. So, these platforms allow citizen developers to rise and become leaders in their business processes and workflows. These platforms empower \"citizen developers\" not only to adopt new techniques and strategies but also to get involved in the whole process of application development.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nUnderstanding Low-Code/No-Code Platforms\n\nFirst of all, both low-code and no-code platforms are programming customization techniques for a high level of expertise in IT, and these two differ in the extent of expertise in information technology required. Low-code development platforms offer a more user-friendly coding experience, which means that a partial amount of programming skill will be required. Thus, the developers are free to do their part of coding as well as to create applications in a personalized manner that meets the unique requirements of the user's business. On the flip side, no-code platforms are completely free from coding as they support those with no technical skills to design applications. Beyond this, businesses can also develop applications using the drag-and-drop method without employing any programmers.\n\nLCNC platforms are designed to make application development faster and more efficient. Whether automating workflows, streamlining processes, or improving customer experiences, LCNC platforms provide the flexibility and speed businesses need to stay competitive. The growing adoption of LCNC platforms has led to impressive market growth. According to Forrester, the combined low-code and digital process automation (DPA) market reached $13.2 billion by the end of 2023, with a projected growth rate of 21% since 2019. This surge is driven largely by the institutionalization of low-code in IT, with 87% of enterprise developers now using low-code platforms for some development work. Furthermore, Forrester predicts this growth to continue, with the market potentially reaching $30 billion by 2028, driven by the increasing adoption of citizen development strategies.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nFuture Growth Potential\n\nWith the rise of generative AI market growth at an annual rate of 36% according to Forrester, LCNC platforms, being inherently flexible and AI-compatible, are poised to benefit from this trend. A similar AI-driven explosion in citizen development could push the LCNC and DPA market to $50 billion by 2028. However, a shift toward high-code methods due to AI-infused development platforms might slow LCNC growth, aligning it with the broader software market's 11% annual growth rate.\n\nThe Rise of Citizen Developers\n\nAdvertisment\n\nOne of the most significant impact of LCNC platforms is the rise of citizen developers\u2014non-technical users who now actively participate in application development. These individuals, often business process owners, possess deep knowledge of their domain but lack formal coding expertise. With LCNC tools, they can develop applications that address their unique challenges, driving innovation within their departments.\n\nThousands of companies are using low-code platforms to develop business-critical solutions. As businesses mature, however, some may encounter nonstandard practices that basic low-code platforms can't address. Borrowing development practices from core development, such as unit testing or build quality control, can help improve a solution\u2019s quality and reduce team effort.\n\nApplications Across Industries\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe versatility of LCNC platforms has led to their adoption across a wide range of industries. For instance, in supply chain management, businesses can develop applications to enhance visibility, traceability, and efficiency. In manufacturing, LCNC tools are powering smart factories by integrating IoT networks and automating workflows.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nIn finance and accounting, LCNC platforms enable businesses to automate complex tasks such as loan approvals and risk assessments. Human resources teams are using them to streamline hiring processes and develop training programs, while even IT departments benefit from faster application development and increased agility.\n\nLCNC platforms play a significant role in business process automation (BPA), complementing robotic process automation (RPA) solutions. RPA bots can follow rules set by citizen developers, reducing bottlenecks and increasing efficiency.\n\nLow-code visual software development is a powerful solution for modernizing legacy systems at reduced cost and with minimal risk. Low-code platforms provide developers with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface through which they find it easier to accelerate their software development and minimize inefficiencies accompanied by security vulnerabilities typical for traditional systems. In general, legacy applications, including ERP systems, happen to be quite cumbersome to update and not cost-effective.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHowever, low-code platforms enable organizations to modernize such systems by integrating cloud-based innovations and extending them with modern web and mobile interfaces without the need to undertake costly customized development. It also helps in the gradual phasing out of existing obsolete applications without causing a jolt.\n\nAn important feature of low-code platforms is the democratization of software development, wherein the complexity of coding work is abstracted into more user-friendly and visual interfaces. This enables the possibility of collaboration among developers with varying skill levels, accelerates time-to-market, and reduces the risk of error. In addition, the built-in security and compliance features ensure that applications are better designed and show adherence to specific industry standards, which enhances the resilience of digital infrastructure.\n\nSuch low-code platforms offer pre-built connectors and APIs that connect easily to legacy systems for easy access to data and, thus, even modernization becomes a simplified exercise. Organizations can unlock actual new opportunities for innovation by embracing low-code development, thus propelling business growth in this fast-paced digital landscape."

That trend likely continues with the Texans' 27 sacks on the year (3rd in NFL).\n\nTyron Smith has let up the most sacks this season for the Jets, with 5 per PFF. He\u2019ll be matched against Will Anderson Jr., one of the league\u2019s most exciting pass-rushers, totaling 7.5 this season.\n\nI like his chances to notch another sack on Thursday (-110 on Fanatics). Anderson\u2018s athleticism and the Texans\u2019 aggressive pass rush should put pressure on Rodgers and create opportunities for the star defensive end to make a big play."

These 20 companies were selected as the best of the Startup Battlefield 200 and competed for a chance to take home the Startup Battlefield Cup and $100,000. After three days of intense pitching, we have a winner.\n\nThe startups taking part in the Startup Battlefield had all been hand-picked to participate in our startup competition. All the companies presented a live demo in front of multiple groups of VCs and tech leaders serving as judges for a chance to win $100,000 and the coveted Disrupt Cup.\n\nAfter hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges\u2019 notes and narrowed the list down to five finalists: Gecko Materials, Luna, MabLab, Salva Health, and Stitch3D.\n\nThese startups made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included Navin Chaddha (Mayfield), Chris Farmer (SignalFire), Dayna Grayson (Construct Capital), Ann Miura-Ko (Floodgate), and Hans Tung (Notable Capital).\n\nWe\u2019re now ready to announce that the winner of TechCrunch Startup Battlefield 2024 is . . .\n\nWinner: Salva Health\n\nSix years ago, while researching for a college entrepreneurship competition, Valentina Agudelo identified a troubling gap in breast cancer survival rates between Latin America and the developed world, with women in her native Colombia and the rest of the continent dying at higher rates due to late detection. She realized that breast cancer is highly treatable when diagnosed early, yet many Latin American countries have large rural populations lacking access to mammograms and other diagnostic tools. So Agudelo and her two best friends decided to create Salva Health, a theoretical portable device that would detect breast cancer early.\n\nRead more about Salva Health in our separate post.\n\nRunner-up: Gecko Materials\n\nIt looks fake, or at least like a good illusion: There\u2019s Gecko Materials founder Capella Kerst dangling a full wine bottle from her pinky finger, the only thing keeping it from smashing to pieces being the super-strong dry-adhesive her startup has brought to market. But it\u2019s no trick. It\u2019s the result of years of academic research that Kerst built on by inventing a method to mass-manufacture the adhesive. Inspired by the way real-life geckos\u2019 feet grip surfaces, the adhesive is like a new Velcro \u2014 except it only needs one side, leaves no residue, and can detach as quickly as it attaches. It can do this at least 120,000 times and, as Kerst noted in a recent interview with TechCrunch, can stay attached for seconds, minutes, or even years.\n\nRead more about Gecko Materials in our separate post.\n\nThese two companies follow in the footsteps of Startup Battlefield legends like Dropbox, Discord, Cloudflare, and Mint on the Disrupt stage. With more than 1,500 alumni having participated in the program, Startup Battlefield Alumni have collectively raised over $29 billion in funding with more than 200 successful exits."

        "article_content": "This feature was taken from our Fleet Leadership special report\n\nIn recent years, fleet decision-makers have been hit with massive levels of hype around new technologies which are predicted to transform the way they move people and goods.\n\nBut much-talked about concepts such as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) and self-driving vehicles have \u2013 as of yet \u2013 struggled to make any meaningful impact as either the technology, legislation or other factors have stymied their introduction.\n\nDevelopment work on them continues, however, and they are still expected to have a major impact in the future, but for now vehicle manufacturers are talking more about another concept: the software-defined vehicle (SDV).\n\n\u201cBetween about 2016 and 2021, those in OEM circles were talking about CASE \u2013 connected, automated, shared, electric \u2013 but that phrase is pretty much dead now,\u201d says Jack Palmer, principal consultant at analysts Frost and Sullivan.\n\n\u201cNo one talks about that any more. If you go through OEMs\u2019 annual statements or reports, they talk about the SDV, which brings together all of those concepts.\u201d\n\nJonathan Davenport, senior director analyst at Gartner, agrees. \u201cThe biggest trend for sure at the moment is the SDV,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the past, autonomous vehicle technology was the number one topic people were enquiring about.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s definitely about SDVs and the impact they will have on the market.\u201d\n\nEach year, Gartner assesses new mobility technologies in its hype cycle series of reports and in its Hype Cycle for Connected Electric and Autonomous Vehicles 2024 document it has described the benefit of SDVs as \u201ctransformational\u201d.\n\nUnder its ranking system, it puts them as being at the peak of inflated expectations \u2013 a period of overenthusiasm and unrealistic projections, where a flurry of well-publicised activity by technology leaders results in some successes, but more failures, as the innovation is pushed to its limits \u2013 and five-to-10 years away from entering the mainstream.\n\nWhat is an SDV?\n\nIt is already possible to make over-the-air (OTA) software updates to the on-board system of some vehicles, as well as applying software patches to improve safety or functionality.\n\nSome manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Tesla, also offer a limited number of software-based services that drivers can subscribe to, such as parking and safety assistance functions.\n\n\u201cThe consumer demand hasn\u2019t been fantastic for these, but it\u2019s certainly there,\u201d says Palmer.\n\nHowever, the SDV concept takes this idea much further and is seen as a significant evolution by the automotive industry, helping to pave the way for further technological advancements such as autonomous vehicles.\n\nKey to this is the architecture of the vehicle. Modern vehicles use an increasing number of on-board computers to make them work: a typical connected car has between 60 and 80 electronic control units (ECUs), all dedicated to a single function such as vehicle lighting, driving aids and power steering.\n\nThe idea with the SDV is to have a streamlined infrastructure using just one or two ECUs, which are much more powerful, more robust and more flexible than the vehicle needs when it is built.\n\nAs well as controlling the car\u2019s functions and process the huge amount of data collected by its various sensors, they will have the capacity to accommodate new functions without slowing the system down.\n\nThis will change the historic link between hardware and software development life-cycles.\n\n\u201cAn analogy I use is what happened in consumer electronics about 20 years ago,\u201d says Davenport.\n\n\u201cYou had all your separate electronic items; your video camera, your digital camera, your calculator, your mobile phone, etc.\n\n\u201cThe companies would encourage you to buy the new model after a couple of years so you could go from a 20MP camera to a 25MP camera, for example.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s almost where we are with automotive today as if you want to get the new functionality you need to buy another car in a few years\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cThe change we are going to see with SDV is that we will get this continuous improvement driven by the software.\u201d\n\nManufacturers will be able to offer OTA updates beyond what is currently possible, allowing them to make money from subscription sales of digital content and software-based features.\n\nIn addition, indirect monetisation benefits will be achieved through OTA updates that fix warranty or recall issues.\n\nThis will change the business model for OEMs, as they will want to drive revenue by selling software-enabled services during the vehicle\u2019s life than just the one-time sale or lease of it. These services promise to deliver much higher gross margins.\n\nStellantis, for example, forecasts around \u20ac20 billion in incremental annual revenue, with a 40% gross margin by 2030, fuelled by software-enabled vehicles.\n\nFleet benefits\n\nThe focus on software \u2013 and with it data \u2013 could have major benefits for fleets.\n\nDavenport says although some major manufacturers are developing their own operating systems, many others \u2013 including General Motors, Volvo, Ford, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and Renault Nissan Mitsubishi \u2013 are using Google\u2019s Android Automotive.\n\nThis should not be confused with Android Auto, which is a mobile app developed by Google to mirror features of a smartphone on a vehicle\u2019s infotainment system.\n\nOne potential effect is that multiple OEMs using the same operating system in their vehicles could change the way fleets use telematics.\n\nCurrently there is no way of getting consistent data collection from different brands of vehicles on a fleet unless fleet decision-makers use aftermarket devices, says Davenport.\n\n\u201cWe always see two counter-trends in the vehicle telematics space,\u201d he adds. \u201cOne is we see organisations trying to dig out the cost of their traditional telematics services so we\u2019ve seen a movement from the black box to an OBD2 dongle, potentially even going to a smartphone application or maybe sourcing data direct from the automotive manufacturer.\n\n\u201cThe counter-trend is that the video telematics space is putting higher-performance computers in an aftermarket box into the vehicle.\n\n\u201cBut what I think could happen with Android Automotive is that an application could be deployed into the different vehicles\u2019 infotainment systems to request things like access to the forward-facing camera, access to the driver monitoring system etc., and so you could have a fleet management package that runs in the vehicle.\n\n\u201cThe automotive manufacturers are still acting as gatekeepers to their application marketplaces, so that may impede this vision, but certainly in the longer term I think that\u2019s what will happen as Android Automotive provides the common data platform that we\u2019ve never really had in the past.\u201d\n\nPalmer identifies a further area where SDVs could benefit fleets \u2013 rental vehicles.\n\n\u201cOne area I really see big potential for, but don\u2019t see any conversation about, is on the rental side,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cThe concept of features on demand \u2013 the idea of flexibly buying or accessing features for a short amount of time \u2013 surely makes sense for the rental sector.\n\n\u201cA customer could get a vehicle, upload their profile and then have all the features they want to use: this sounds like a fantastic use case.\u201d\n\nGartner says the introduction of SDVs will also eventually lead to a new market for car hardware upgrades as eventually \u2013 and as with smartphones and computers \u2013 there will come a point when an SDV\u2019s factory-installed computing hardware will not be able to cope with in-life software advancements.\n\nOn average, a passenger car\u2019s useful life is around 12 years in the US and Europe, it says, and this will increase given the greater longevity of electric vehicles.\n\nThis means the widespread adoption of the zero-emission technology will bring a major long-term drop in the revenue from new car sales and aftersales for OEMs.\n\nHowever, easy and price-competitive vehicle hardware updates will allow OEMs to keep selling new digital features/services to the owner to replace this lost revenue, as well as extending an SDV\u2019s useful life.\n\nIn today's rapidly changing world, fleet managers aren't just managing vehicles\u2014they're leading critical conversations about strategy, sustainability, and efficiency. And whether you realise it or not, you are at the centre of key decisions that shape your business.\n\nYou play a pivotal role where finance, HR, operations, and procurement meet, ensuring cost efficiency, legal compliance, and CSR efforts are realised. Fleet managers are at the heart of driving business success.\n\nOur latest special report on \u201cFleet Leadership\u201d is packed with insights and strategies to help you become a standout leader in your organisation. Dive into critical topics like mentoring future fleet leaders, aligning fleet policies with business goals, and building sustainable mobility frameworks."
