            "article_content": "BALTIMORE- Maryland is now among the states reporting sightings of mysterious drones, as thousands of calls have poured into the FBI about large drones flying over the northeastern United States.\n\nFormer Governor Larry Hogan said he spotted drones flying over his home in Davidsonville, Anne Arundel County this week.\n\nNina Shea recorded a video on Wednesday of what she believes is a drone\u2014or some sort of unidentified object\u2014flying near the Calvert Cliffs nuclear power plant in Prince Frederick.\n\nAnd she's seen more since then.\n\n\"First, I started seeing what looked like the drones that they are seeing in New Jersey, just steady lights that looked like they could be an airplane, but not exactly the same and not the shape of an airplane\u2014and then shortly after that I started seeing orbs, which is what I got on video,\" Shea said. \"I'm still not sure what I saw there because it was so bizarre.\"\n\nNina Shea\n\nShe slowed down the mysterious object and zoomed in with her phone. Shea told WJZ she did report the sighting to local police at their non-emergency phone number.\n\n\"When I see it in person it is very scary because I have no idea what it is,\" she said. \"I'm honestly very concerned because the idea they are military vehicles or possibly something from a foreign government, even though I don't really think that's the case, that is just a terrifying idea. I'm just trying not to think about it too much.\"\n\nNina Shea\n\nArmy-Navy game no drone zone\n\nMaryland's U.S. Attorney announced drones would be prohibited at the Army-Navy game in Maryland on Saturday with several high-profile leaders in attendance.\n\n\"Drone operators need to know that we take seriously any incursion in the restricted airspace around the Army-Navy Game. Such incursions threaten the safety of those involved. We will investigate and prosecute anyone who violates the no drone zone,\" said U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron.\n\nFormer Governor Hogan records drones\n\nFormer Governor Hogan recorded video of what he believes were multiple drones outside his Anne Arundel County home Thursday.\n\n\"We are being told that neither the White House, the military, the FBI, or Homeland Security have any idea what they are, where they came from, or who has launched or is controlling them\u2013and that they pose no threat. That response is entirely unacceptable,\" Hogan posted. \"I join with the growing bipartisan chorus of leaders demanding that the federal government immediately address this issue. The American people deserve answers and action now.\"\n\nFederal response\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday that \"we have not been able to corroborate any of the reported visual sightings\" and that many of the drones are manned aircraft being operated lawfully.\n\nThe FBI has received more than 3,000 tips according to CBS News.\n\nThe FAA said Thursday that at the request of federal partners, it had published two temporary flight restrictions prohibiting drone flights over Picatinny Arsenal Military Base and Trump National Golf Club Bedminster.\n\nCBS Philadelphia reports drones flew into the airspace over Naval Weapons Station Earle, in Colts Neck, New Jersey.\n\n\"Our initial assessment is that this is not the work of a foreign adversary or a foreign entity,\" Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said on Wednesday.\n\nAfter assessing that the drones are not a threat to military installations, the Pentagon is leaving it up to local law enforcement and the FBI to investigate the origins and type of drones.\n\nSingh said the drones were not U.S. military drones, and she refuted an idea presented by Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey that there was an Iranian \"mothership\" off the East Coast of the United States launching the drones.\n\nPushing for answers\n\nMaryland Republican Congressman Andy Harris said he has received many reports of drones in his district, which includes Maryland's Eastern Shore.\n\n\"We need transparency now from the White House to find out if these drones are a threat to our national security, and if they are, we need to take proper corrective action immediately,\" Representative Harris tweeted.\n\nHe told Fox Business that the government should shoot down unauthorized drones that fly over military installations.\n\n\"There shouldn't be hesitation,\" Harris told the network.\n\nNina Shea, the Marylander who recorded drone images, is frustrated with the lack of clear answers.\n\n\"I don't like how I've heard some public officials downplaying it or saying people aren't seeing what they're seeing because I've seen it every night for the past few nights and it's very real. I think we need some answers soon,\" she told WJZ.\n\nShooting them down?\n\nSingh, the Pentagon deputy press secretary, said base commanders have the authority to shoot them down if they pose a threat to military installations, but so far, there hasn't been a threat.\n\nU.S. Northern Command, which oversees protecting the territory of the United States, said in a statement that it has not received requests from local law enforcement to assist.\n\n\"We are aware and monitoring the reports of unauthorized drone flights in the vicinity of military installations in New Jersey to include Picatinny Arsenal and Naval Weapons Station Earle, and we refer you to those installations for information on any efforts they are may be conducting to ensure the safety and security of their personnel and operations,\" the statement said."

Learn More.\n\nGoogle is set to unleash the power of Gemini with upgraded capabilities when it launches Android 16 for the consumer market next year. In this version, the AI assistant becomes an agent that does things for the human user. A new API introduced to Google\u2019s Developers page allows the AI assistant to perform actions inside the phone\u2019s apps on behalf of the users, a huge improvement that can automate hundreds of daily phone activities.\n\nThe AI assistant will play a bigger role as it transitions to its next generation of becoming agentic, which uses reasoning and planning to solve complex problems on its own. When put in a smartphone, it could potentially revolutionize user experience.\n\nHeavy Speculation About Agentic AI\n\nGoogle released Android 16 for developers in November, sparking an air of mystery and speculation about the new feature for its AI assistant. The \u201capp function\u201d feature likely provides Gemini capabilities to automate daily phone activities with little to no human intervention.\n\nGoogle explains the \u201capp function\u201d as \u201ca specific piece of functionality that an app offers to the system,\u201d adding that \u201cthese functionalities can be integrated into various system features.\u201d It will let \u201capplications \u2026 execute functions they define.\u201d\n\nThis means Gemini can execute a specific function of an application when triggered or called upon by the system, as long as such a function is \u201cregistered and made available.\u201d In other words, Gemini can shop online using the phone\u2019s app with very little or no intervention from the user. For example, an \u201corderFood\u201d function lets the AI assistant do the job without the need for the user to open a food delivery service app to order pizza.\n\nGemini is currently the default AI assistant for most Android phones and devices. However, the upgraded Gemini would be more than just an AI assistant that interacts with phone apps and external services\u2014giving it the capacity to control the functions inside the applications on behalf of the phone\u2019s user adds a hefty measure of utility and power to smartphones."

US-based companies attracted the lion\u2019s share, raising $2.9 billion across 127 deals and this does not include OpenAI\u2019s notable $6.6 billion round.\n\nSome standout funding rounds include Magic, a coding assistant startup that secured $320 million in August, and Glean, an enterprise search company, which raised $260 million in September.\n\nMeanwhile, Hebbia, a business analytics firm, drew $130 million in July. Furthermore, investments extended beyond the U.S., with China\u2019s Moonshot AI raising $300 million and Japan\u2019s Sakana AI closing a $214 million round focused on scientific discovery.\n\nUnfortunately, the rapid expansion of generative AI also brings challenges, particularly regarding energy consumption. According to Bain & Company, companies deploying AI at scale will require gigawatt-scale data centers, which consume up to 20 times the power of typical data centers today. This demand risks straining global electricity and labour markets.\n\nAre you a pro?

Microsoft, for instance, announced plans to source power from the controversial Three Mile Island nuclear facility, though such projects could take years to become operational.\n\nDespite these environmental and technical hurdles, investor interest in generative AI remains high. ElevenLabs, known for its viral voice-cloning tool, is reportedly seeking to raise funds at a $3 billion valuation. Black Forest Labs, the company behind a controversial image generator on the X platform, is also in talks for a $100 million funding round.\n\nVia TechCrunch"

But the historical roots of this time of year have always had a darker, spookier side. Long before Charles Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol \u2014 an era when families of Victorian England gathered to share ghost stories by the fire on Christmas Eve \u2014 pre-Christian folklore told of a thin veil between worlds, where spirits (and goblins, beasts, and gods) lingered during the winter solstice.\n\nThose ancient beliefs blend with modern natural introspection of the holidays. Along with the (sometimes saccharine) jubilations, Christmas and the winter festivities encourage people to reflect on the past, lost loved ones, and the lingering \u201cghosts\u201d of memory. Add to that how this month is populated by magical home invaders, and a creepy surveillance imp on the shelf, and December is a rather fitting time for mystery, the macabre, and paranormal tales.\n\nCelebrating the scarier side of the holidays is not only a sort of subversive counter-programming by pairing cheer with fear, it allows us to acknowledge the dichotomy of light and dark, contrasting cozy, nostalgic evenings with long, eerily silent nights.\n\nAll of this is a very drawn out way of saying I love getting creepy, spooky, and downright scary gifts for the holidays, and I love shopping for loved ones who also appreciate a little splash of blood red with their Christmases so white. And so, we return with a Talking Strange Show \u201cSeason\u2019s Screamings Gift Guide\u201d for 2024. After the success of last year\u2019s guide, we are going bigger and bloodier with gift suggestions for the horror and paranormal fans in your life. Comic books, action figures, statues, graphic novels, swanky shirts and hats, paranormal investigation equipment, and even some vodka and cologne are all included, and all part of the theme."

            "article_content": "MA Ganapathy (File photo)\n\nNEW DELHI: When laying hands on a book penned by a recently retired IPS officer, you would normally expect tales of gallantry, security strategy insights and, even better, some inside and juicy details of investigations into high-profile cases that can possibly generate enough media interest to get the memoirs flying off the shelves.But M A Ganapathy \u2014 who hung up his boots earlier this year after discharging key roles as DG, NSG and Uttarakhand DGP as well as earlier stints in the CBI, Union home ministry and Central police organisations \u2014 in his debut novel \u2018 Whispers in the Shadows \u2019, a collection of short stories , has chosen to go with the paranormal rather than normal. With the government of India having tightened rules to rein in bureaucrats\u2019 post-retirement \u201ckiss and tell\u201d memoirs, Ganapathy has steered clear of making his literary foray with a first-person account in James Bond-style and dabbled instead in Ruskin Bond \u2019s much-loved art of narrating \u2018spooky events and paranormal encounters \u2019 set in the woods and quaint Indian towns.Taking a cue from the Uttarakhand-based celebrity author, Ganapathy in \u2018Whispers in the Shadows\u2019 (mind you, not \u2018Whispers in the Corridors\u2019, which would anyday be a more awaited offering from an ex-bureaucrat), puts together hair-raising and captivating tales set in UP/Uttarakhand, Ganapathy a.k.a. Avinash\u2019s cadre state; his native home in the coffee haven of Coorg set in the Western Ghats; his alma mater JNU (not named in the book) and even his Central postings in CISF and as head of Bureau of Civil Aviation and Security (BCAS).It could thus not be more apt that \u2018the\u2019 Ruskin Bond himself introduces \u2018Whispers in the Shadows\u2019 on the cover as \u201ccompelling, intriguing and genuine\u201d.Ganpathy stars in and as Avinash, a protagonist he has cleverly created to narrate his rather frequent brushes with the supernatural. There are enough giveaways: Avinash, like Ganapathy, is a native of Coorg, or Kodagu. The stories \u2018Shriek in the Woods\u2019 and \u2018Babu\u2019s Hurricane Lamp\u2019 may remind you or your own childhood \u2014 the fear of Maths, walks from the school through the haunted woods and spooky stories fed to wide-eyed children by the househelps \u2014 and have a flash of R K Narayan\u2019s \u2018Swami\u2019 from Malgudi Days.Each of the tales has Avinash narrating his weird, ghostly, time-travel and post-death experiences in a lucid but captivating, edge-of-the-seat style. The book is a window to the life of a senior police officer who is trained to be fearless and rely on scientific evidence but who is also human enough to marvel at and embrace the unexplained, supernatural experiences along the way. So much so, Ganapathy made it a point to chronicle these chilling life incidents and produce a novel soon after he retired.The stories may be intriguing, sometimes rather incredible (particularly The Curious Case of Class of 1986, which sees Avinash travel through different realms of time), but they also carry a message. The ghosts and supernatural entities, including dead dogs, seem to help in solving knotty murder cases (The Uncanny Experience in Behta Village and Little Khairi Still Roams the Wilds), save lives (Do Miracles Really Happen Anymore and The Small Boy Who Loved Airports) and ensure that the forests and wildlife are protected (Bote Aiyappa of the Sacred Grove)."

            "article_content": "It may not have won \u201cWord of the Year,\u201d but romantasy is still the reigning champion of many readers' hearts.\n\nAlex Belanger shares her romantasy recommendations with more than 16,000 followers on TikTok. Because the 31-year-old Kentuckian grew up in a sheltered religious sect, she's always been drawn to \u201cRapunzel\u201d stories. Fairytales about broadening worldviews and unexplored places were a childhood comfort. During the pandemic, she stumbled into romantasy books on TikTok, and found they both reminded her of her youth and reflected her interests as an adult.\n\nBelanger is just one of the many readers steering one of publishing's prized horses \u2013 the genre's sales increased 42% from 2022 to 2023, according to Circana.\n\nWhat is romantasy?\n\nA portmanteau of the words \u201cromance\u201d and \u201cfantasy,\u201d romantasy blends two beloved genres. Readers get all the best parts of swoony love story tropes, magical world-building and high-stakes adventure.\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\nMany romantasy books include fae or fairies, dragons, elves and other mythical creatures. Popular series \u201cA Court of Thorns and Roses\u201d by Sarah J. Maas is a \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d retelling set in a divided realm of humans and faeries. \u201cFourth Wing\u201d by Rebecca Yarros, another romantasy favorite, follows a young girl training to become a dragon rider.\n\nThe world-building is more expansive than many other romance subgenres. In paranormal romance, for example, magical characters often appear in normal society rather than in an entirely new, imagined land.\n\nBut the two genres often overlap, especially with their readership. Ali Hazelwood\u2019s \u201cBride,\u201d which features a romance between a vampire and werewolf, was a recent hit with romantasy fans.\n\n\u201cThe blurring of these lines is just exciting and expansive and allows authors and publishers to have a greater diversification of contents, of character,\u201d says Ashley Doliber, the senior director of marketing strategy at Entangled Publishing, which houses such series as Rebecca Yarros' \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Obsidian\" by Jennifer L. Armentrout. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to color within certain lines, you have the opportunity to really push those boundaries.\u201d\n\nIs romantasy the right genre for you?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a fantasy fanatic to get in on the fun. Many readers credit romantasy series like \u201cACOTAR\u201d as the reason they got back into reading, even if they were initially hesitant to try the genre. And despite their length, they tend to be fast-paced, immersive reads.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to choose from, which keeps the genre fresh, says Belanger. She recommends switching up the tropes and types of mythical beings in your books. Worlds inhabited by fairies or dragons are among the most popular, but she's recently seen an uptick in \u201cshifter\u201d protagonists, who, as the name suggests, can morph between human and animal forms.\n\nRomantasy is also the perfect genre for those who grew up reading fan fiction.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to find a lot of the people that write romantasy are the people that wrote fan fiction in the past,\u201d Belanger says.\n\nJulie Soto, author of \u201cRose in Chains,\u201d used to write \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fan fiction. Hazelwood\u2019s \u201cThe Love Hypothesis\u201d was originally published online as \u201cReylo\u201d fan fiction (yes \u2013 as in Rey and Kylo Ren from \u201cStar Wars\u201d).\n\nMore than just \u2018spicy\u2019: Readers find romantasy empowering\n\nThere\u2019s something so unputdownable about stepping into a magical world and finding your OTP (one true pairing).\n\nSteamy romance novels are sometimes seen as the fluff of the literary world. Society has long been quick to invalidate female sexuality and empowerment as \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d reads.\n\n\u201cThat escapism aspect is certainly key,\u201d Doliber says. \u201cBut I think what a lot of genre fiction allows is the opportunity to simultaneously have that fun, joyful, thought-provoking escapism (and) at the same time, you\u2019re tackling real-world themes\u201d like female empowerment and agency.\n\nIt\u2019s also one corner of the internet where readers have been able to embrace their sexuality and center female pleasure. Some readers told HuffPost that romance books and erotica have helped improve their sex lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really great way to help your mind become open and break away from purity culture,\u201d Belanger says. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in a woman\u2019s pleasure and knowing what you want.\u201d\n\nBest romantasy books\n\nRomantasy may be buzzy, but it\u2019s not a new genre. Belanger cites \"foundational\" romantasy reads (which, in the 2010s, were more medieval than fae) like Mary E. Pearson\u2019s \u201cThe Remnant Chronicles\u201d and Marissa Meyer\u2019s fairytale retellings in \u201cThe Lunar Chronicles.\u201d\n\nModern classics include Sarah J. Maas' three bestselling romantasy series \"A Court of Thorns and Roses,\" \"Throne of Glass\" and \"Crescent City.\" Rebecca Yarros is another big name in romantasy with \"Fourth Wing,\" \"Iron Flame\" and her upcoming \"Onyx Storm,\" which releases in January.\n\nIf you want to dive into the romantasy genre, here are the titles Belanger suggests starting with:\n\n\u201cA River Enchanted\u201d by Rebecca Ross\n\n\u201cHouse of Dragons\u201d by K.A. Linde\n\n\u201cSong of the Forever Rains\u201d by E.J. Mellow\n\n\u201cA Court this Cruel and Lovely\u201d by Stacia Stark\n\n\u201cFor the Wolf\u201d by Hannah Whitten\n\n\u201cThe Bridge Kingdom\u201d by Danielle L.

Armentrout\n\n\u201cThese Hollow Vows\u201d Lexi Ryan\n\n\u201cHouse of Beating Wings\u201d Olivia Wildenstein\n\n\u201cThe Serpent and the Wings of Night\u201d Carissa Broadbent\n\n\u201cDivine Rivals\u201d Rebecca Ross\n\n\u201cSpark of the Everflame\u201d Penn Cole\n\nNot the right fit for you?

These locations are usually fascinating places full of wonder, but sometimes they can hide something far more sinister.\n\nEvery now and then, a game can feature an eerie-looking place that hides an even more disturbing secret. Coming across a location like this can be pretty creepy on its own, but if you dare to delve deeper into its mysteries, the degree of fear can reach critical levels.\n\nAlthough a game you play may appear nice and innocent, it can also contain an unresolved murder mystery, a secret monster, or a terrifying story of cosmic proportions in its darkest and scariest corners.\n\nThe discovery of such a place can send you down a deep rabbit hole that will change your perspective on the world of the game and make you wonder if it really is what it claims to be.\n\nIf you're not afraid to poke around creepy places and uncover their dark secrets, the following list will pique your curiosity. Otherwise, you might want to steer clear of the locales and the mysteries we're about to unravel."

This state of matter also has properties that mimic how light and particles interact in the universe.\n\nHowever, proving the theory has, until now, proved very challenging. To this end, the international team developed advanced experiments (like neutron-scattering) and theoretical models to attempt to observe this state of matter for the first time.\n\nAnd, by all accounts, they appear to have been successful.\n\nA major breakthrough\n\n\u201cFractional matter quasiparticles, long theorized in quantum spin liquids, required significant advancements in experimental resolution to be convincingly tested in this type of material,\u201d said Romain Sibille, the experimental team leader at Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland."

            "article_content": "We have discovered thousands of exoplanets in the last few decades, while the number of planets in the Solar System has remained at eight \u2013 but our discovery of more might not yet be over.\n\nA team of researchers say they have found the \"strongest statistical evidence yet that Planet 9 is really out there\", after studying a population of distant, unstable objects that cross Neptune's orbit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn 2015, two astronomers from Caltech presented evidence that six objects past the orbit of Neptune were bunched together in a way that suggested they were being \"herded\" by something with a large gravitational pull.\n\nDespite suggestions the planet could be due to a statistical anomaly and selection bias, the team believes the objects could be moving due to the influence of a large object beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\nIn a recent paper, the team looked at long-period objects that crossed the path of Neptune's orbit, finding that their closest point of orbit to the sun was around 15-30 astronomical units (AU), with one AU being the distance between the sun and the Earth.\n\n\u24d8 IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCarrying out simulations to try and discover what best explains the orbits of these objects, the team found that a model that includes a massive planet beyond the region of Neptune explained the steady state of these objects much better than in simulations where planet 9 was not included.\n\n\u24d8 IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.\n\nThough this is intriguing, the analysis does not narrow down where to look for such a planet.\n\nIt is also not the only possible explanation for the unusual orbits of trans-Neptunian objects. Another team believes it could be down to a close encounter, where a star passed by our own Sun several billion years ago in our history.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe team ran 3,000 simulations of scenarios where stars of various masses passed by our own at different distances. Though we have only discovered an estimated 1-10 percent of TNOs, making further observations and study of their orbits necessary for a full explanation, the researchers found that a close flyby of a slightly smaller star than our own could produce a Solar System that looks remarkably similar to how it looks today.\n\n\"The best match for today's outer Solar System that we found with our simulations is a star that was slightly lighter than our Sun \u2013 about 0.8 solar masses,\u201d Amith Govind, co-author of the \u201cclose encounter\u201d hypothesis paper, explained in a statement. \"This star flew past our sun at a distance of around 16.5 billion kilometres [10.3 billion miles]. That's about 110 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, a little less than four times the distance of the outermost planet Neptune.\u201d\n\nThankfully, we might not have too long to wait for either hypothesis to be further tested.\n\n\"Excitingly, the dynamics described here, along with all other lines of evidence for Planet 9, will soon face a rigorous test with the operational commencement of the Vera Rubin Observatory,\" the authors of the Planet Nine paper concluded. \"This upcoming phase of exploration promises to provide critical insights into the mysteries of our solar system\u2019s outer reaches.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe \u201cPlanet Nine\u201d study is published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and the \u201cclose encounter\u201d study in Nature Astronomy.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in April 2024."

            "article_content": "YouTube has had quite a monumental year in terms of user engagement, logging in over a billion hours of content streamed daily on TV sets alone. However, the platform is also home to a sea of content that isn\u2019t safe for children, which is why a dedicated kids\u2019 experience has been there for a while.\n\nNow, YouTube is adding a password protocol that will keep young users from accessing any other profile apart from their designated kid\u2019s profile on a TV. In a community update, the company introduced the new Parent Code feature that will block kids from accessing user profiles for adults in their household.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIt is an opt-in feature that needs to be enabled manually. Once activated, this code will be required if kids want to access a profile meant for other members of their family. Moreover, they will also be prompted to enter the code if they want to access the video platform without any Google account signed in.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nGoing a step further, the team will also require the parent code if an individual attempts to remove an account from the shared TV. YouTube has also clarified that enabling the new feature won\u2019t affect other devices on which the same account is being used.\n\nIn order to enable the Parent code feature, follow this path:\n\nIn the YouTube app installed on your TV, navigate to the Settings page. You will see a dedicated Parent Code tab in the Settings dashboard. Go through the on-screen prompts and set up the four-digit Parent Code. In order to disable the safety feature, you need to enter the same code in the future.\n\nDo keep in mind that once you remove the parent code, anyone can enjoy YouTube sans any age restrictions for content and without having to sign up with a Google account. Moreover, all user profiles belonging to adult members will be openly accessible.\n\nThe latest safety-focused feature update from YouTube is actually a corrective measure on the company\u2019s end. Earlier this year, Google pulled away the separate YouTube Kids app icon in the YouTube experience for TVs and smart devices.\n\nInstead, the profiles for kids and adults were all clubbed together under the \u201cWho\u2019s watching\u201d launch banner. \u201cNow, you can easily select your child\u2019s profile from within the YouTube app, and you\u2019ll be brought right into the new YouTube Kids experience on TV,\u201d the company reasoned back then.\n\nHowever, it seems that not all parents and guardians were happy with the move, apparently because it makes it far easier for kids to access other user profiles that show content without any age restrictions. Locking non-kids profiles behind a passcode is a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Parent Code feature on YouTube is now rolling out and will start appearing for all users within the next few days."

            "article_content": "We have discovered thousands of exoplanets in the last few decades, while the number of planets in the Solar System has remained at eight \u2013 but our discovery of more might not yet be over.\n\nA team of researchers say they have found the \"strongest statistical evidence yet that Planet 9 is really out there\", after studying a population of distant, unstable objects that cross Neptune's orbit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn 2015, two astronomers from Caltech presented evidence that six objects past the orbit of Neptune were bunched together in a way that suggested they were being \"herded\" by something with a large gravitational pull.\n\nDespite suggestions the planet could be due to a statistical anomaly and selection bias, the team believes the objects could be moving due to the influence of a large object beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\nIn a recent paper, the team looked at long-period objects that crossed the path of Neptune's orbit, finding that their closest point of orbit to the sun was around 15-30 astronomical units (AU), with one AU being the distance between the sun and the Earth.\n\n\u24d8 IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCarrying out simulations to try and discover what best explains the orbits of these objects, the team found that a model that includes a massive planet beyond the region of Neptune explained the steady state of these objects much better than in simulations where planet 9 was not included.\n\n\u24d8 IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.\n\nThough this is intriguing, the analysis does not narrow down where to look for such a planet.\n\nIt is also not the only possible explanation for the unusual orbits of trans-Neptunian objects. Another team believes it could be down to a close encounter, where a star passed by our own Sun several billion years ago in our history.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe team ran 3,000 simulations of scenarios where stars of various masses passed by our own at different distances. Though we have only discovered an estimated 1-10 percent of TNOs, making further observations and study of their orbits necessary for a full explanation, the researchers found that a close flyby of a slightly smaller star than our own could produce a Solar System that looks remarkably similar to how it looks today.\n\n\"The best match for today's outer Solar System that we found with our simulations is a star that was slightly lighter than our Sun \u2013 about 0.8 solar masses,\u201d Amith Govind, co-author of the \u201cclose encounter\u201d hypothesis paper, explained in a statement. \"This star flew past our sun at a distance of around 16.5 billion kilometres [10.3 billion miles]. That's about 110 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, a little less than four times the distance of the outermost planet Neptune.\u201d\n\nThankfully, we might not have too long to wait for either hypothesis to be further tested.\n\n\"Excitingly, the dynamics described here, along with all other lines of evidence for Planet 9, will soon face a rigorous test with the operational commencement of the Vera Rubin Observatory,\" the authors of the Planet Nine paper concluded. \"This upcoming phase of exploration promises to provide critical insights into the mysteries of our solar system\u2019s outer reaches.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe \u201cPlanet Nine\u201d study is published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and the \u201cclose encounter\u201d study in Nature Astronomy.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in April 2024."

Such gains might even make investors forget that its current price is still 35% below the stock's peak in November 2021.\n\nNonetheless, a greater focus on its software business and the continuing growth of e-commerce have got the company back on track. Hence, the stock could continue to benefit investors amid its recovery.\n\nThe state of Shopify's stock\n\nThroughout its history, Shopify has stood out among e-commerce platforms. Its ability for no-code site development and the flexibility to customize websites drew entrepreneurs to Shopify, and the company's emphasis on website speeds reduced the possibility that website issues would hamper sales for its customers.\n\nMoreover, Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate of 19% for the e-commerce industry through 2030. This should mean more merchants turn to Shopify as more retail sales businesses move online.\n\nShopify has further emphasized its competitive advantage with ancillary services such as managing payments, monitoring inventory, or supporting email marketing campaigns. This part of the business, called merchant services, accounts for the majority of Shopify's revenue.\n\nHowever, an effort to expand merchant services into logistics brought about high expenses and ongoing losses, which contributed to a massive stock price decline in 2022. That led to Shopify reversing course and selling that business. After selling the logistics enterprise and suffering through some impairment charges, Shopify has again become profitable and stock price growth has returned.\n\nShopify's financials\n\nAdmittedly, Shopify has not grown as fast as it did before or during the pandemic when revenue growth either closely matched or, at times, exceeded the 50% level. Furthermore, Shopify increased the prices for its services in 2023, so its not clear how that affected customer churn.\n\nNonetheless, the company's revenue for the first nine months of 2024 of $6.1 billion increased 23% yearly. This closely matches the 25% growth forecast for this year and the 22% predicted in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, Shopify has reduced its operating expenses slightly in 2024. Investors might also remember that the $1.3 billion impairment from the sale of the logistics business in 2023 led to losses in that year despite a $1 billion gain from its equity investments. Amid those developments, its $726 million net income for the first three quarters of 2024 represents a vast improvement from the $525 million loss in the same year-ago period.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "I know what you want \u2014 Week 15 fantasy football rankings. The playoffs are here, or start next week, so no fluff for you. Let\u2019s get to the ranks, sleepers, game notes and everything else.\n\nReminder! I always have some fun ranks! This can be anything from cartoons to players from the 80s to things not to do when you\u2019re over 30 \u2014 feel free to suggest yours. And, I try to answer as many comments as humanly possible\u2026 however\u2026 if it\u2019s a simple WDIS within a position or \u201cWho should I trade for?\u201d type question, those are 99% covered with the ranks and link to the trade charts. Let\u2019s duckin\u2019 go!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#CheckTheLink-age\n\nPRO TIP to get to the ranks quickly once you\u2019ve read the piece: Click the little comment box at the top right, and it drops all the way to the comments, just below a small scroll up to the rankings\n\nWEEK 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL PREVIEWS\n\nRams at 49ers, Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Rams and 49ers defenses are Top 6 in allowing TD/Drive (Rams 27.6%; 49ers 26.9%).\n\n\u25ba If the 49ers play Isaac Guerendo, you have to take the chance they believe he\u2019s okay and treat him as a high-end RB2 (with risk, admittedly). If Guerendo is out, Patrick Taylor is a high-upside/high-risk RB2/3 given the potential involvement of other backfield options.\n\n\u25ba If you take the four games after Brandon Aiyuk\u2019s injury, and when Brock Purdy wasn\u2019t hurt going in (Week 13), Jauan Jennings is WR4 in FPPG (19.1) with a league-high 34.1 TmTGT% \u2014 Deebo Samuel is WR64 (6.2) and WR40 (18.2%).\n\nChiefs at Browns, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Since his second game with the Chiefs, DeAndre Hopkins has never run more than 68.0% of the routes, has bounced around from 12.5-25.0 TmTGT% and has posted fantasy tallies of 34.6, 7.6, 4.4, 12.0, 11.0 and 11.2 points. Hopkins is more of a floor option, but his ceiling makes him the one Chiefs wideout to start.\n\n\u25ba In Isiah Pacheco\u2019s second game back, Kareem Hunt fell to 25.0 RBTouch%, dropping him out of Flex consideration, especially with Samaje Perine also mixed in. And Nick Chubb has topped 62.5% of the Browns rushes just twice, both in wins.\n\n\u25ba Jerry Jeudy and Elijah Moore haven\u2019t seen much of a usage difference without Cedric Tillman on the field outside of increased red zone and touchdown opportunities. Obviously, that\u2019s significant, but I wouldn\u2019t downgrade Jeudy if Tillman plays, and Moore would remain a boom/bust WR4.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBengals at Titans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Week 14 was Tee Higgins\u2019 first non-double-digit fantasy score since Week 4 and the lowest TmTGT% of the year (11.6).\n\n\u25ba Week 14 was also just the second time Nick Westbrook-Ikhine didn\u2019t score a touchdown or have at least two receptions since Week 4. The good news is that according to FTN Data, the Bengals allow the third-highest wide-open rate to outside receivers (10.3%) \u2014 you saw this first-hand on MNF \u2014 and the second-most FPPG (21.4). I\u2019m not calling him a must-start after last week, but if you need NWI\u2019s ceiling, it\u2019s still in play.\n\nCommanders at Saints, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Jeremy McNichols is a decent deep-league option. The Saints have allowed the most YPC (5.0) and a nice 7.8 YPR to running backs this year, and they have the third-best APA for opposing RBs.\n\n\u25ba With Derek Carr behind center, Marquez Valdes-Scantling was worth the ceiling as a WR4, but now, Alvin Kamara and Juwan Johnson (maybe) are the only Saints worth starting.\n\nRavens at Giants, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Ravens are still a favorable matchup for the passing game, but they have been better in their past three games, and Malik Nabers is an injury risk. There is a near-zero floor here.\n\n\u25ba The Ravens are a nightmare for opposing running backs, which means Tyrone Tracy Jr. is just an RB3 given the matchup and the Giants\u2019 woes (also lost another offensive lineman, Jon Runyan, this week).\n\n\u25ba Gambling on Rashod Bateman is a matchup decision \u2014 games with 9+ points: TB, CIN (x2), LAC, DAL, WSH \u2014 games with 6 or fewer points: KC, LV, DEN, PIT, CLE, BUF, PHI. Only LAC and LV are a bit unordinary, and the Giants haven\u2019t been beaten much in the passing game\u2026 though, teams haven\u2019t needed to pass much to beat them.\n\nCowboys at Panthers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba Rico Dowdle has nearly 20 touches in each of his past three games and is RB12 in FPPG (13.4). In his five games with at least 16+ touches, Dowdle is averaging 16.3 FPPG, which would be RB8 on the year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u25ba Adam Thielen\u2019s past two games: 28.4 TmTGT%, 17.3 FPPG, 100.5 YPG and 2.72 YPR. It\u2019s a small sample, but if you want the year-long pace applied to where he\u2019d rate: third, second, third and fifth, respectively.\n\nJets at Jaguars, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba If Breece Hall plays, consider him an RB2 given the risk, but his Top 10 upside would still be in play. Braelon Allen would be an RB3, and Isaiah Davis wouldn\u2019t be far behind. If Hall is out, Allen would be an RB2 and Davis an RB3. Despite his ability and upside, the Jets should be in control, allowing them to lean on Allen a tad more.\n\n\u25ba The Jaguars go 3-and-Out the most (41.8%), and the Jets defense has the fourth-highest forced 3&O% (36.6). It\u2019s not a great week to need either running back.\n\nDolphins at Texans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba This year\u2019s Dolphins offense doesn\u2019t operate the same as last year\u2019s \u2014 I discussed this on my podcast a few weeks ago \u2014 and Jaylen Waddle is better against man-heavy defenses than zone (due to how defenses are playing them and adjustments made to counteract). Unfortunately for Waddle, the Texans are the fifth-heaviest zone team (76.8%).\n\n\u25ba C.J. Stroud has actually been more accurate when blitzed this year, with similar Comp%, Time to Throw and Sack% marks, but the big differences are lower YD/Comp (13.3 to 11.5) and TD/Att% (6.9 to 4.8). Stroud was without Nico Collins for much of the year, but defenses taking away Tank Dell with/without Collins on the field has also hurt.\n\nColts at Broncos, Sunday, 4 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Broncos blitz the second most (25.5%), and Anthony Richardson hasn\u2019t been great throwing the ball in those situations, but he\u2019s evaded it quite a bit \u2014 low 4.3 Sack% (sixth-lowest) and fifth-most rushing yards (72).\n\n\u25ba The last time Courtland Sutton didn\u2019t have double-digit fantasy points in a game? Week 7, when he had zero targets against the Saints \u2014 he also had double-digit tallies in three of four games before that. While Sutton has topped 20 points just once, he\u2019s as stable of a WR2 as you can find.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBills at Lions, Sunday, 4 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba If Keon Coleman returns, he\u2019s in play as a Hail Mary option. Coleman is WR13 in YPRR against man coverage (2.81), and the Lions are the man-heaviest team (41.3%).\n\n\u25ba Week 14 was James Cook\u2019s worst fantasy outing of the season, but the Bills were pass-happy \u2014 and then some \u2014 and Cook still had 100% of the RB rushes (Josh Allen and Curtis Samuel had the other rushing attempts). The risk with this matchup is the Bills deploy a similar strategy, making Cook a riskier RB2 than usual.\n\nSteelers at Eagles, Sunday, 4 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Eagles have the fourth-highest QBPressure% (38.7) with only four rushers, and the Steelers allow the fourth-highest QBPressure% with just four rushers (37.3). Further, Russell Wilson is completing just 30.0% of his passes when under pressure (22nd).\n\n\u25ba George Pickens sounds unlikely to play. If he\u2019s out there, he\u2019s worth the gamble in a WR3 way, similar to Malik Nabers last week. If out, Pat Freiermuth gets a modest bump, but you should avoid anyone else not named Jaylen Warren. Yes, I\u2019d find a way to sit Najee Harris if possible.\n\nPatriots at Cardinals, Sunday, 4 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Cardinals have given up decent numbers in the passing game to running backs, giving Rhamondre Stevenson a decent floor.\n\n\u25ba Marvin Harrison Jr. has been more involved against man coverage (31.4 TmTGT%), plus he has a higher TD/TGT% (9.4) compared to 19.1 and 5.8, respectively, against zone coverage. This is all very good news for the rookie. The Patriots run the third-most man at 40.9%.\n\nBuccaneers at Chargers, Sunday, 4 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba With the 11th-best YPRR against Cover-3 (2.98), Quentin Johnston could be worth the risk again this week \u2014 the Buccaneers use Cover-3 fifth-most at 43.4%.\n\n\u25ba If Bucky Irving plays, he\u2019s a must-start. If he\u2019s out, Rachaad White is a must-start, and Sean Tucker would be a Flex upside gamble (given the stingy Chargers defense, you\u2019d mostly be hoping for a touchdown).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u25ba If Ladd McConkey returns, you don\u2019t sit him. His return would push Joshua Palmer and Quentin Johnston into WR4/5 territory with the hope of a touchdown. If McConkey is out, you can boost both into the WR3/4 range with that same ceiling/risk but slightly higher floors.\n\nPackers at Seahawks, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba If Romeo Doubs returns, Jayden Reed would be the top Packers wideout, followed by Doubs and Christian Watson, though all three would be closely ranked\u2026\n\n\u25ba The Seahawks defense has turned a corner since midseason, and you can see it in the APA numbers. They are -2.9 for QBs and -3.0 for WRs compared to the league average.\n\n\u25ba If Kenneth Walker is out, Zach Charbonnet is in the RB1 conversation, and if Walker returns, I\u2019d consider Walker and Charbonnet as we do Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren. Walker may be safer, but Charbonnet has the upside, and he could even lead the way given his recent performance.\n\nBears at Vikings, Monday, 8 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The Vikings blitz a league-high 26.9%. Caleb Williams is just 28th in TD+1D/ATT when blitzed (15.6%), with the second-highest Sack% (13.7).\n\n\u25ba As you saw previously, Williams handled the Vikings well \u2014 zero sacks when blitzed. DJ Moore and Keenan Allen had big games, and while I would go back to Moore and Allen this week, I wouldn\u2019t lock Williams into a repeat given the likely adjustments by DC Brian Flores and the Vikings defense.\n\nFalcons at Raiders, Monday, 8:30 p.m. ET\n\n\u25ba The interceptions were drive-killers, but Kirk Cousins looked better than he has in weeks, especially given it was a tough matchup. Now he gets the Raiders, and they run zone just 59.9% of the time \u2014 fourth lowest (also, Giants next week, and they\u2019re seventh lowest). It\u2019s not without risk, but Cousins has some streamability this week.\n\n\u25ba If Alexander Mattison returns, stay away from the backfield. If he remains sidelined, Sincere McCormick is a volume-reliant RB2/3.\n\nWEEK 15 SLEEPERS\n\nQUARTERBACK\n\nKirk Cousins, ATL \u2014 We\u2019ve seen the floor, but that\u2019s why Cousins is a sleeper (per above).\n\nRUNNING BACK\n\nRico Dowdle, DAL \u2014 Also, see above.\n\n\u2014 Also, see above. Justice Hill, BAL \u2014 Giants can\u2019t stop running backs, plus hope for garbage-time touchdown.\n\nWIDE RECEIVER\n\nKeenan Allen, CHI \u2014 If the Bears plan to rebound, Allen will be needed.\n\n\u2014 If the Bears plan to rebound, Allen will be needed. Adam Thielen, CAR \u2014 Not a sleeper \u2014 or, well, he shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 Thielen is a must-start.\n\n\u2014 Not a sleeper \u2014 or, well, he shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 Thielen is a must-start. Marvin Harrison Jr., ARI \u2014 Another one from the above notes, he\u2019s been inconsistent, but the matchup is promising.\n\nTIGHT END\n\nJake Ferguson, DAL \u2014 Good matchup. He saw six targets against the Bengals, even though he only caught half.\n\nFUN WITH RANKS\n\nWhat\u2019s this? No \u201creal\u201d list this week? Nope. I want to put the onus on all of you this week. Nicole and I had never watched Schitt\u2019s Creek, and we just burned through it in a month. With the offseason coming, I want some good\u2026 no, great!\u2026 shows to watch, and if it\u2019s a comedy, bonus points! I\u2019ll give you a list of shows we have on our \u201cto-watch\u201d list so you know what\u2019s already planned. Try to keep it to the past five years, maybe 10 \u2014 we have seen a lot before that.\n\nWatching when we can: Shrinking (S2), Penguin and Silo (S2)\n\nAlso on the list: Special Ops (S2), Day of the Jackal (maybe? Tell us if it\u2019s not worth it), Cross (same as Jackal), Skeleton Crew, Dexter: Original Sin, LOTR (S2), Squid Game (S2)\n\nWEEK 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL PROJECTIONS\n\n\ud83d\udea8 HEADS UP \ud83d\udea8 These can differ from my rankings, and MY RANKS are the order I\u2019d start players outside of added context, such as, \u201cNeed highest upside, even if risky.\u201d Also, based on 4-point TDs for QB, 6-point rest, and Half-PPR\n\nWEEK 15 FANTASY FOOTBALL RANKINGS\n\n\ud83d\udea8 HEADS UP \ud83d\udea8\n\nThere is no perfect widget out there, sadly, still. I know many view this on your phone, but 1) use the rankings widget on a PC/laptop/etc. if possible or 2) open in your phone\u2019s browser, especially for Android users, to get the scrolling to work (or Android people can try a two-finger scroll).\n\nECR = \u201cExpert\u201d Consensus Ranking (which isn\u2019t updated by everyone consistently, so take with a grain of salt).\n\nUpdated regularly, so check up to lineups locking.\n\n(Top photo of Rico Dowdle: Tim Heitman-Imagn Images)"

            "article_content": "2024 was a year of mixed successes for the top smartphone industry players, but the devices we got were some of the best we\u2019ve ever seen. There were notable comebacks, a continued and welcome trend of maturation in the foldable space, a distinctly less welcome trend of promises of future AI features that didn\u2019t really live up to the hype, and a certain August launch that threw the Android Authority\u2018s usual content plans for a loop (thanks for that, Google!).\n\nThrough it all, we delivered more exclusive reports and deep dives than we\u2019ve ever shared in any calendar year, and we\u2019re not stopping any time soon. But now isn\u2019t the time to look forward, it\u2019s time to cast an eye back as we crown our Editor\u2019s Choice smartphone of the year 2024. Read on for our top five!\n\nBest foldable? Best camera phone? Best tablet? All this and more in our best tech of 2024 awards.\n\nCheck out the result of our Reader's Choice phone of the year award!\n\nHow we chose our winner\n\nRobert Triggs / Android Authority\n\nBefore we get to our top five, here\u2019s how we chose them. Our Editor\u2019s Choice award for smartphone of the year isn\u2019t a mantle we bestow lightly. The overall winner and the runners-up are all phones that go beyond success on a spec sheet.\n\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve reviewed over 40 phones. That process included extensive testing in performance, battery, and charging benchmarks, as well as subjective analysis of photography, hardware design, software smarts, update policies, and much much more. Our expert product testers spend countless hours digging into what makes these devices tick, and while everyone has their own favorites and preferences, when it comes to picking the year\u2019s best, we bring all of our senior editors and product testers together and reflect on our highest-reviewed phones as a collective of experts.\n\nIn 2024, we reviewed over 40 phones. Our expert product testers spend countless hours digging into what makes these devices tick.\n\nThe class of 2024 was made up of 20 phones from 12 brands from all over the globe. From there, each member of the jury assigned votes to their top five picks, ranked from fifth to first. Fifth place earned a single point, fourth took two points, and so on, up to a maximum of five points for the top pick. The phone that received the most points took home the grand prize.\n\nWith all the votes tallied, our winner took our most prestigious annual award in an absolute landslide\u2026\n\nAndroid Authority\u2018s Editor\u2019s Choice phone of the year 2024 Ryan Haines / Android Authority Four years at the top for a Pixel, but we\u2019ve never seen such a dominant win as this. With just shy of double the amount of votes as our runner-up, the Google Pixel 9 Pro takes the crown. With the Pro-tier Pixel winning in 2022 and 2023, this isn\u2019t a huge surprise \u2014 we\u2019re obviously big Pixel fans here. However, what really stands out this year is the fact the Pixel 9 Pro managed such a massive points gap despite the vote being split for the first time ever not between two Pixel flagships, but three. Yet, as much as we still loved the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL (mild spoiler for later in this list), the newly shrunken Pixel 9 Pro was the one that left the biggest impression. While it wasn\u2019t exactly a return to the Pixel 5-style small phone form factor, Google learned all the best lessons from the iPhone Pro range and delivered a reasonably-sized flagship (with a hint of iPhone inspiration to the overall design), while still managing to squeeze in all the best of the series \u2014 Gemini, Tensor, the photography chops, the most extensive software support guarantee in the business, and more. So, congrats to Google and the Pixel 9 Pro, our Editor\u2019s Choice smartphone of the year winner for 2024, and a phone that we told you was coming, but still managed to surprise us when it did. Google Pixel 9 Pro Google Pixel 9 Pro Impressive AI-powered features \u2022 Excellent build quality \u2022 Flexible, capable cameras \u2022 Reliable update commitment MSRP: $999.00 All Pro, in a compact package. The Google Pixel 9 Pro is the Pixel device many have been begging for for a long time: Google's very best smartphone hardware and software features, in a more compact form factor. With identical dimensions to the regular Pixel 9, it retains the same great specs as the much larger XL model, plus 16GB of RAM, up to 1TB of internal storage, and the Tensor G4 chipset.

Long gone are the days when we see anything particularly new from Android\u2019s de facto ultra-flagship, but you can\u2019t knock it for consistency. The Galaxy S24 Ultra may have dropped half a star from its perfect-scoring predecessor in our review as a result of a $100 price hike that didn\u2019t quite feel earned, and some persistent camera motion woes, but the sheer brilliance across the board was undeniable. Additions like the then-bleeding-edge Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chipset and the brand-new titanium frame joined the usual hallmarks of excellence we expect from Samsung\u2019s top dog. There was also the debut of Galaxy AI, which, while not quite as mature as Google\u2019s AI offerings, has grown over time to add real value to the Galaxy experience. It didn\u2019t come close to snatching the top spot, but it did comfortably secure the runner-up position. With Samsung\u2019s iron grip on the smartphone industry starting to slip a little, can the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra do one better in 2025? We\u2019ll have to wait and see. Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra Powerful, flexible cameras \u2022 Excellent update commitment \u2022 Brilliant flat display MSRP: $1,299.99 The best of the best in the S24 series Samsung's true flagship device, the Galaxy S24 Ultra offers the very best specs and features from any Galaxy phone to date. Ai and camera functions are the name of the game, with a 200MP primary camera, 50MP 5x telephoto, 10MP 3x telephoto, and 12MP ultrawide shooters. Smaller display bezels, 2,600 nit display, 5,000 mAh battery, an advanced cooling vapor chamber, up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage, and 12GB of RAM make for a powerful mobile computing system. The new ProVisual Engine offers AI-powered camera tools for photo and video capture.

Yes, we\u2019re Android Authority, but you can\u2019t talk with any actual authority about the devices and platform we dedicate ourselves to without testing out and intimately knowing what the competition is up to. And yep, it turns out that the iPhone 16 Pro is a pretty excellent phone. While some of its shine was dampened by the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence (and its fairly underwhelming current state), the iPhone 16 Pro nevertheless stood out, much like the Pixel 9 Pro, as another regular-sized flagship phone that refused to compromise. iOS 18 is better (and more Android-y!) than ever, the Action Button and overall design blueprint are being copied by Android brands for a reason, and the reduced real estate didn\u2019t lead to a loss of power under the hood. It didn\u2019t do enough to convince many of us on the team that a permanent switch would be worth it (myself included \u2014 no thank you), but the iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s bronze medal is a reminder of how capable Android\u2019s biggest rival continues to be. Apple iPhone 16 Pro Apple iPhone 16 Pro Excellent hardware \u2022 Flexible cameras \u2022 Solid software support MSRP: $999.00 The best of the iPhone 16 series, in a compact form factor. The iPhone 16 Pro offers a sleek 6.3-inch display with ultra-slim bezels for a refined, modern design. It features an upgraded 48MP ultrawide camera, 5x optical zoom on the telephoto lens, and a new touch-sensitive shutter button for a DSLR-like photography experience. Powered by a faster chip optimized for AI, the iPhone 16 Pro delivers top-tier performance in striking colors like gold titanium.

The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL was the pinnacle of that promise \u2014 the Pixel series\u2019 best specs in the biggest possible package. As a lover of super-sized phones, this was my personal top pick, and while the Pixel 9 Pro romped home with the overall victory, the XL-ent larger model can be proud of its fourth place finish. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Google Pixel 9 Pro XL The best specs in the Pixel 9 series \u2022 Gorgeous display \u2022 Seven years of software updates MSRP: $1,099.00 Pure XL-ence. Google reserves its best hardware for the largest device in the line. The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL offers a 6.8-inch display, the biggest battery we've ever seen in a Pixel phone, and 37W wired charging. Otherwise, the Pixel 9 Pro and the Pixel 9 Pro XL share almost all other hardware and software features, giving users the option between display sizes with top hardware.

The OnePlus Open deservedly took the runner-up spot in 2023, but there was no OnePlus foldable challenger in 2024 (side note: our top-ranked foldable was the Motorola Razr (2024), which came in joint sixth alongside the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE). But the OnePlus 12 becomes the first slab-style phone from the Android stalwart to crack the top five in our end-of-year Editor\u2019s Choice list since the OnePlus 7T way back in 2019. A Pro-grade phone without Pro in the name, the OnePlus 12 summoned some of that old-school flagship killer spirit, offering ridiculous power and rapid charging while undercutting many of its contemporaries on price. OnePlus 12 OnePlus 12 Bright, sharp display \u2022 Blistering-fast charging \u2022 Approachable price MSRP: $799.00 The flagship killer returns. The OnePlus 12 is an important update for the brand that never settles. The phone offers the latest and best technology, including a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, 50W wireless and 80W wired charging, next-gen Hasselblad cameras, and more.

            "article_content": "Altman called the change in the relationship \u201ctremendously sad.\u201d He continued:\n\nI grew up with Elon as like a mega hero. I thought what Elon was doing was absolutely incredible for the world, and I\u2019m still, of course, I mean, I have different feelings about him now, but I\u2019m still glad he exists. I mean that genuinely. Not just because I think his companies are awesome, which I do think, but because I think at a time when most of the world was not thinking very ambitiously, he pushed a lot of people, me included, to think much more ambitiously. And grateful is the wrong kind of word. But I\u2019m like thankful. You know, we started OpenAI together, and then at some point he totally lost faith in OpenAI and decided to go his own way. And that\u2019s fine, too. But I think of Elon as a builder and someone who \u2014 a known thing about Elon is that he really cares about being \u2018the guy.\u2019 But I think of him as someone who, if he\u2019s not, that just competes in the market and in the technology, and whatever else. And doesn\u2019t resort to lawfare. And, you know, whatever the stated complaint is, what I believe is he\u2019s a competitor and we\u2019re doing well. And that\u2019s sad to see.\n\nAltman said of Musk\u2019s close relationship with Trump:\n\nI may turn out to be wrong, but I believe pretty strongly that Elon will do the right thing and that it would be profoundly un-American to use political power to the degree that Elon has it to hurt your competitors and advantage your own businesses. And I don\u2019t think people would tolerate that. I don\u2019t think Elon would do it.\n\nOn OpenAI\u2019s relationship with Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI\u2019s largest investor, has put more than $13 billion into the company and has an exclusive license to its raw technologies. Altman once called the relationship \u201cthe best bromance in tech,\u201d but The Times and others have reported that the partnership has become strained as OpenAI seeks more and cheaper access to computing power and Microsoft has made moves to diversify its access to A.I. technology. OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion this year because of the steep costs of developing A.I.\n\nAt the DealBook Summit, Altman said of the relationship with Microsoft, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re disentangling. I will not pretend that there are no misalignments or challenges.\u201d He added:\n\nWe need lots of compute, more than we projected. And that has just been an unusual thing in the history of business, to scale that quickly. And there\u2019s been tension on that.\n\nSome of OpenAI\u2019s own products compete with those of partners that depend on its technologies. On whether that presents a conflict of interest, Altman said:\n\nWe have a big platform business. We have a big first party business. Many other companies manage both of those things. And we have things that we\u2019re really good at. Microsoft has things they\u2019re really good at. Again, there\u2019s not no tension, but on the whole, our incentives are pretty aligned.\n\nOn whether making progress in A.I. development was becoming more expensive and slower, as some experts have suggested, he doubled down on a message he\u2019d previously posted on social media: \u201cThere is no wall.\u201d Andrew asked the same question of Sundar Pichai, the Google C.E.O., which we\u2019ll recap in tomorrow\u2019s newsletter.\n\nOn A.G.I. and A.I. safety\n\nAltman has a business interest in suggesting that A.G.I. is near: When OpenAI decides that it has reached the milestone, Microsoft\u2019s exclusive license to use OpenAI\u2019s raw A.I. technologies ends. That would be a big bargaining chip in its negotiations with Microsoft. At the DealBook Summit, Altman suggested that A.G.I. was closer than most people expect, but he downplayed safety concerns, some of which he has raised himself or have come from his own former employees:\n\nA lot of the safety concerns that we and others expressed actually don\u2019t come at the A.G.I. moment. It\u2019s like, A.G.I. can get built, the world goes on mostly the same way. The economy moves faster, things grow faster.\n\nAltman said that he did expect there would be quick disruption of jobs in the relatively near term, but that the major upheaval would come with what he called \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Despite the fact that the population has been reeling from heightened inflationary pressures over the past two years, public food distribution under various social protection schemes fell by about 6 percent year-on-year in the first half of the current fiscal year.\n\nPublic agencies, including the Directorate General of Food and the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, only distributed about 13.78 lakh tonnes of rice and wheat through food distribution programmes until December 5, according to data from the food ministry.\n\nThis was a marked decrease from the 14.63 lakh tonnes distributed by state agencies between July 1 and December 14 of the previous fiscal year.\n\nThe Awami League government, which was ousted by a mass uprising on August 5, had cut food distribution plans this fiscal year, lowering its target from 33.56 lakh tonnes in FY24 to 30.3 lakh tonnes in FY25. Economists said it was an illogical decision, especially in light of soaring food inflation.\n\nInflation hit a four-month-high of 11.38 percent in November, while food inflation soared to 13.80 percent from 12.66 percent in October, according to data from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics.\n\nGiven the cost-of-living crisis, scaling up public food distribution programmes for the poor and the vulnerable is the need of the hour. But the government appears to be shying away from this task, according to experts.\n\n\"Low distribution is not logical as this year's economic situation is more dire than that last year,\" said M Asaduzzaman, former research director at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS).\n\n\"Inflation is severely hurting low-income people,\" he said, urging the government to increase the target.\n\nAsaduzzaman also raised questions about government data on food distribution.\n\n\"How can we believe the food distribution data when everything else was based on falsehoods?\" he asked, referring to the recent white paper on the state of the economy, which revealed that the immediate past government had been fudging the numbers to prop up a false narrative of economic growth.\n\n\"It is clear that the prices of food grains have increased. People from all walks of life are suffering now,\" he said.\n\nData shows that the decline in food distribution was mostly linked to reduced grain transfers under the Food for Work (FFW) programme.\n\nThe relief and disaster management ministry distributed 52,742 tonnes under the FFW programme last year. This year, it has managed to provide only 68 tonnes.\n\n\"The government is probably facing a stock crisis,\" Asaduzzaman said.\n\nEchoing those sentiments, Mohammad Yunus, a research director at the BIDS, said there is a close relationship between food procurement and distribution in Bangladesh.\n\n\"The government needs to emphasise the procurement process as well as timely imports,\" he said.\n\nUsually, the authorities concerned cannot procure food grain timely, leading to low stocks.\n\n\"It seems officials cannot get the prices that they decide upon in procurement meetings,\" Yunus said.\n\nHe added that changing market dynamics also had an impact. \"The market pattern has changed now. Earlier, farmers used to sell their grains immediately. Now they take time.\"\n\nThe government should take accurate and timely decisions to avoid any untoward situation, he added.\n\n\"To boost stocks, the government should focus on importing food grains when global prices are supposed to reduce,\" he said.\n\nClaiming that the data was incomplete, Md Abdus Salam, director of Supply, Distribution and Marketing Department (Current Charge) at the Directorate of Food, said overall food distribution may increase when data is completely updated.\n\nFollowing the mass uprising in July, many dealers of the Open Market Sales (OMS) programme went into hiding, hampering the initiative, he said.\n\nAbout the FFW programme, Salam said it may have been hindered due to the disruption of local government protocols.\n\nHowever, he claimed they had increased distribution programmes while focusing on flood-affected districts. \"No channels were left out of operation. The distribution will increase this year,\" he said."

            "article_content": "Cloud transformation is reshaping industries, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation, efficiency, and cost optimization. The luxury goods, government, and corporate sectors are leveraging cloud technologies to modernize operations and enhance customer experiences. Strategic cloud adoption enables these industries to navigate the complexities of multi-cloud environments, safeguard against cybersecurity threats, and drive sustainability. The projects led by Pravin Pandey, a seasoned cloud architect, illustrate how comprehensive cloud strategies can transform organizational infrastructures and establish frameworks for long-term success.\n\nElevating Luxury Retail with Cloud Modernization\n\nIn the luxury goods and high-end jewellery industry, cloud architecture plays a pivotal role in modernizing IT infrastructures to support operational agility, enhance customer experiences, and maintain a competitive edge. Pravin has been instrumental in leading transformative initiatives to drive enterprise-wide cloud adoption, tailored specifically to the unique demands of this sector. His efforts enabled a successful transition from Capex to Opex financial models, granting the organization greater budget flexibility while achieving significant cost savings.\n\nPravin also implemented a cutting-edge microservices architecture for critical business applications, significantly enhancing scalability and operational efficiency. His expertise reflects a deep understanding of how technology can align with the goals of a luxury-focused enterprise, fostering innovation while maintaining the precision and reliability essential in this highly competitive market.\n\nIn addition to technical advancements, his efforts have fostered innovation by implementing AI-driven solutions that optimize operational workflows and enhance customer personalization. The establishment of an Architecture Review Board under his leadership ensures that all cloud solutions align with organizational objectives, setting a strong foundation for future growth.\n\nTransforming Government Operations\n\nIn one of the state government\u2019s projects, Pravin directed large-scale cloud migrations, automating processes to reduce provisioning times from months to minutes. He designed and deployed hybrid cloud infrastructure for over 14 state agencies as part of a $219 million digital transformation initiative. By establishing AWS Landing Zones and implementing disaster recovery solutions, he ensured that critical state operations were secure, efficient, and compliant with regulatory standards.\n\nAutomation played a vital role, reducing server provisioning time from months to minutes. This streamlined approach enhanced inter-agency connectivity, facilitated better resource utilization, and delivered millions in cost savings. The initiative stands as a benchmark for government IT modernization, showcasing how cloud infrastructure can enhance public service delivery.\n\nModernizing Corporate Ecosystems\n\n\n\nHighly reputed corporate entities have greatly benefited from Pravin\u2019s strategic leadership. By migrating over 2,700 servers across EMEA and US regions, he achieved a 30% reduction in CAPEX while transitioning critical business applications to a cloud-based microservices architecture. His emphasis on FinOps optimization led to a 15% reduction in overall cloud expenses, and automating 95% of post-provisioning tasks significantly reduced operational overhead.\n\nThese transformations underscore the growing importance of integrating multi-cloud strategies into corporate IT frameworks. Businesses adopting such approaches gain agility, enhance scalability, and reduce costs, positioning themselves to remain competitive in rapidly evolving markets.\n\nEstablishing Security and Sustainability Standards\n\nAcross projects, cybersecurity has been a central focus. Pravin implemented comprehensive security frameworks, ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR and PIPL. These measures not only protected sensitive data but also enhanced organizational trust in cloud adoption.\n\nAdditionally, his work reflects a commitment to sustainability. By consolidating data centers and adopting edge computing technologies, he reduced energy consumption and minimized environmental impact. The shift to AI-driven resource management further optimizes utilization, aligning with global sustainability goals.\n\nDriving Industry-Wide Impact\n\nThe broader implications of Pravin\u2019s initiatives underscore the transformative power of cloud adoption. In luxury retail, modernization enhances the customer journey through personalized experiences and efficient operations.

            "article_content": "If you've ever wondered what the world looks like from a polar bear's perspective, this incredible footage can give you a good insight.\n\nScientists said they were left 'amazed' after examining the 115 hours of video they captured while strapping cameras to the animals as they roamed around Canada.\n\nAs well as giving us a deeper understanding of what it's like to move around on all fours, the clips also highlighted how clever these creatures really are.\n\nThe thing is, this species have been hit hard by the effects of climate change over the last few years and are now considered as 'vulnerable' by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group.\n\nAdvert\n\nVast amounts of sea ice are melting due to global warming, which poses quite the problem to polar bears, as they use the frozen sheets as stepping stones to score some lunch.\n\nDue to the fact the animals' primary food source is seals, the lack of sea ice really throws a spanner in the works when it comes to their survival.\n\nAccording to the WWF, polar bears also use sea ice to 'rest, breed, and store energy for the summer and autumn, when food can be scarce'.\n\nIt's now melting earlier in the spring and forming later in the autumn in the bears' southern range, the organisation warned, in spots such as Hudson Bay and James Bay in Canada.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd the impact of this is worrying, to say the least.\n\nThe incredible footage gave us an insight into the life of a polar bear from their perspective (USGS/Washington State University)\n\n\"For every week earlier that the ice breaks up in Hudson Bay, bears come ashore roughly 22 pounds lighter and in poorer condition,\" the WWF said.\n\nPolar bears are being forced to spend more time on land as a result of the melting sea ice, but food high in calories is hard to come by for the animals - hence their dramatic weight loss.\n\nAdvert\n\nSo, to get to the bottom of how the polar bears were dealing with this life-and-death dilemma, scientists strapped cameras to 20 of them who were wandering around Hudson Bay.\n\nThe team scoured through more than 100 hours of footage captured over a three-year period, which showed the creatures eating, sleeping, hunting and having fun.\n\nThey were seen feeding on bird carcasses, chowing down on berries and grass, feasting on marine animals, as well as play-fighting with each other in the water and chewing on antlers.\n\nAnthony Pagano, wildlife biologist at the US Geological Survey (USGS) and leader of the study, previously told Vox about the findings: \"We were amazed by the video footage.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"The video footage really highlighted how intelligent these animals are by using different behaviour strategies to survive their time on land while without access to their primary prey.\"\n\nBefore the study, scientists presumed that polar bears might be coping with prolonged periods on land by resting to save energy, or filling up on other prey such as plants and seabirds.\n\nThe animals are being forced to forage for food on land due to the melting sea ice (OLIVIER MORIN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe footage and other data collected by boffins - such as the amount of energy burned and measurements of movement - suggests that the predators actually did both, with some heading out in search for food and others opting to have a little lie down instead.\n\nAdvert\n\nDespite the split in approaches among the polar bears, sadly neither was successful - and all but one of the 20 subjects lost weight.\n\nAlarmingly, one even lost nearly 80 pounds.\n\nScientists also found that polar bears were taking longer swims in search of food, which is 'unexpected for this time of year', according to polar expert at the University of Alberta Andrew Derocher.\n\nDerocher further explained: \"These are possibly acts of desperation. Hungry and skinny bears take more risks than fat bears.\"\n\nEssentially, eating berries and smaller prey isn't enough to tide a polar bear over.\n\n\"This study really brings home the message that there\u2019s no salvation from terrestrial feeding to help polar bears through the ice-free period,\" Derocher added.\n\nThe polar bear population in this area is estimated to have fallen 30 percent since 1987, and this study appears to prove that global warming will continue to make it even harder for the species to survive."

            "article_content": "\n\n/\n\n\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Friday called upon recently returned teachers from Finland to spearhead an educational revolution in the state, transforming government schools into vibrant hubs of quality learning. Addressing the teachers at his official residence, Mann lauded their successful training in Finland and emphasized the critical role they play in building a strong foundation for the nation\u2019s future.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historic day for Punjab as our teachers return equipped with world-class expertise,\u201d said the Chief Minister, urging the teachers to serve as role models, imparting skills and knowledge that would allow students to compete with their peers from private schools. The Chief Minister highlighted that the state\u2019s initiative to send 72 primary teachers for advanced training in Finland was not just a trip but a mission to overhaul the education system.\n\n\n\nMann elaborated on why Finland was chosen for this program, citing its globally acclaimed education system. \u201cThe training has provided our teachers with innovative techniques and best practices that will not only enhance their teaching abilities but also bring a much-needed boost to our education sector,\u201d he stated.\n\n\n\nThe program is aimed at broadening the professional skills of teachers, fostering leadership qualities, and equipping them with advanced pedagogical tools.\n\n\n\nThe Chief Minister emphasized that the enriched expertise of these educators would empower government school students to excel academically and socially. \u201cThis initiative will enable the creation of an education system that nurtures every child's potential,\u201d Mann asserted.\n\n\n\nMann called the Finland training program a \u201cred-letter day\u201d in Punjab\u2019s history. He expressed confidence that such initiatives would help Punjab become a frontrunner in education. \u201cThis training will act as a seed, growing into a tree of knowledge that benefits not just individuals but entire communities,\u201d he envisioned.\n\n\n\nTo further support these efforts, Mann announced plans for creating platforms where Finland-trained teachers could share their experiences and expertise with colleagues, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. He encouraged teachers to take pride in their transformative role, adding, \u201cEducation is the most powerful tool for progress, and you hold the keys to unlocking our state\u2019s potential.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Chief Minister also underscored the importance of aligning students\u2019 academic paths with their interests rather than societal pressures. He urged parents and teachers to nurture children\u2019s individual strengths, allowing them to achieve their aspirations.\n\n\n\nAdding an exciting dimension to the occasion, Education Minister Harjot Singh Bains announced upcoming student visits to premier institutions like the Indian Institute of Science and Google\u2019s headquarters. \u201cThis will provide students with valuable exposure to cutting-edge technologies and inspire them to dream big,\u201d he stated.\n\n\n\nTeachers Laud Initiative, Share Experiences\n\nEquipped with innovative methodologies, the delegation of 72 educators \u2014 including BPEOs, CHTs, HTs, and primary teachers \u2014 shared their transformative experiences.\n\n\n\nManmeet Singh, a teacher from Ludhiana, reflected on how Finland\u2019s playful learning techniques replaced their reliance on traditional methods. \u201cWe\u2019ve started sharing these techniques with fellow educators, and the results are promising,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBathinda\u2019s Daljit Singh recalled praise from Finnish trainer Cristina, who applauded Punjab\u2019s initiative. \u201cHer encouragement inspired us to share our experiences with local communities, bringing renewed energy to our teaching,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Talwara\u2019s Amrinderpal Singh Dhillon emphasized how the training instilled a profound sense of responsibility among the participants. \u201cThis visionary program will drive grassroots change in education,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBaljit Kaur Parmar, a primary teacher from Fatehgarh Sahib, expressed how the experience boosted her confidence. \u201cI feel equipped to contribute more effectively, both inside and outside the classroom,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nEducators were especially impressed by Finland\u2019s emphasis on practical education. Anoop Singh Maini from Tarn Taran highlighted, \u201cThe Finnish system focuses on practical learning alongside academics, a model we aspire to replicate in Punjab.\u201d\n\n\n\nSCERT director Amaninder Kaur Brar emphasized the need for integrating practical tools into classrooms, such as carpentry workshops, to provide hands-on learning experiences. \u201cThis approach will ensure students apply theoretical knowledge effectively,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\nSeveral teachers acknowledged the psychological benefits of the training. Hoshiarpur\u2019s Vandana Heen said: \u201cIt was a joyful learning experience that encouraged us to rethink our teaching practices.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers, like Nirmaljeet Kaur of Tarn Taran, highlighted Finland\u2019s unique approach to time management and moral education. \u201cThese lessons will prove invaluable as we apply them in our schools,\u201d she shared.\n\n"
