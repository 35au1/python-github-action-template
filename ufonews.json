            "article_content": "With global interest in UFOs at an all-time high, particularly in the United States where mysterious drone sightings have been driving everyone crazy, two Israeli researchers have uncovered fascinating patterns in who reports these mysterious sightings \u2014 and when.\n\nTheir study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, reveals that UFO reports might tell us less about what\u2019s in the sky and more about what\u2019s happening on the ground, particularly in our bank accounts.\n\nOhad Raveh from Hebrew University and Nathan Goldstein from Bar-Ilan University were trying to solve an interesting puzzle: How can we measure what the public is paying attention to in different places and at different times? This is important for understanding the economy, but it\u2019s difficult to measure.\n\nThey looked at years of data cataloguing recorded sightings of UFOs \u2014 or as they refer to them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena).\n\nTheir assumption was that when people report seeing something strange in the sky, they\u2019re clearly paying attention to their surroundings. The researchers thought this could be a useful way to measure public attention.\n\n\u201c We set out to understand what the association is between attention given to the sky and attention given to the economy,\u201d explains Raveh.\n\nTwo contradictory findings?\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of reports from the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States and discovered that more wealthy areas consistently report more UFO sightings than less wealthy regions.\n\nRaveh and Goldstein initially believed that this phenomenon could be explained by understanding attention as a hierarchical system: you give attention to the most pressing issues before you worry about other things.\n\n\u201cOnce you give attention to the fundamental things, then you may give attention to things that are more luxurious,\u201d Raveh elaborates. \u201cAttention to the economy is a fundamental thing, because in the end that\u2019s what brings food to your table. But once you attend to that, then you have more time on your hands to start looking at the sky.\u201d\n\nSo, because people who are more financially secure can let their minds (and eyes) wander from their budgets, they\u2019re more likely to see UAPs, right?\n\nHowever, that theory runs into some turbulence when considering the second pattern they uncovered during their research: Across the board, both poor and wealthy areas saw an increase in UFO sightings during economic downturns \u2013 a pattern that caught the researchers by surprise.\n\n\u201c We thought that the two types of attention would be substitutable. Because attention is a limited resource, and if you give attention to, say, the sky, that would be at the expense of other types of attention that you can give to other factors like the economy,\u201d says Raveh. \u201cBut apparently it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: Wealthy areas generally report more UFOs than poor areas, but when any area hits hard economic times, UFO reports increase.\n\nTurns out rich people get to spend more time looking for aliens. Photo by Jonas Von Werne via Pexels\n\nIt\u2019s all about attention\n\nThis apparent contradiction makes sense when you realize UFO reports are really measuring how much attention people are paying to their surroundings.\n\nWealthy people generally have more free time and mental space to notice unusual things in the sky. But during economic downturns, people everywhere have more time on their hands (often due to job losses or reduced work hours) and thus spot more UFOs.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by what the researchers saw during Covid lockdowns: When people were forcibly given more free time (even if they weren\u2019t necessarily experiencing economic hardship), UFO sightings increased.\n\nOverall, the research findings serve as strong evidence that UFO/UAP sightings serve as a reliable indicator of public attention patterns, which opens new possibilities for understanding how public attention influences economic outcomes.\n\nOnly one question remains, though \u2014 have the researchers seen any UFOs themselves?\n\n\u201c I wish!\u201d jokes Raveh. \u201cActually, since we started to work, I\u2019ve tried to give more attention to the skies. But I haven\u2019t seen anything, unfortunately. I hope they visit Israel sometime.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

Free software for creating images and videos has led to a surge in slop, driven by scammers, spammers and the occasional genuine user seeking to go viral.\n\nFacebook\u2019s most recent report from its Transparency Center reveals that two of the top five most widely viewed images on the network in the three months to September were AI-generated \u2013 viewed 38.6m and 35.8m times respectively.\n\nMatt Navara, a social media consultant, says the novelty of these posts has quickly worn thin for many of Facebook\u2019s billions of users.\n\n\u201cThe proliferation of low-quality or spammy AI content risks cluttering feeds and diminishing overall user satisfaction,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing little evidence yet that users are actively demanding such content in their feeds.\u201d\n\nIn March, Facebook users began to notice a flood of images featuring Jesus Christ mixed with a crustacean rising from the sea. These \u201cShrimp Jesus\u201d posts garnered hundreds of thousands of interactions and tens of millions of views.\n\nOther weird AI trends soon emerged, including African women building fruit sculptures and young children showing off elaborate birthday cakes with the caption: \u201cThis is my first cake\u201d."

For context, always refer to the full article.\n\nThe gaming app promoted in the misleading video is not on Pagcor\u2019s list of licensed electronic and offshore gaming platforms\n\nClaim: The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) launched an online gaming platform in partnership with a global software developer company.\n\nRating: FALSE\n\nWhy we fact-checked this: The Facebook ad was posted by a page with over 1,100 followers and has already gained 24,300 likes, 3,200 comments, and 352 shares as of this writing.\n\nThe video begins with a supposed news report by ABS-CBN newscaster Karen Davila about the launch of a new online gaming platform, PH888.COM, by Pagcor. The platform is purportedly developed in partnership with a global software company called \u201cProblematic Play.\u201d\n\nThe advertisement promotes the platform as a safe gaming app, assuring players they will win the jackpot prize within a week.\n\nThe facts: Pagcor has not announced its supposed launch of the gaming app on any of its official channels.\n\nBased on Pagcor\u2019s List of Service Providers and Registered Domains/URLs as of December 18, 2024, PH888.com is not on the list of licensed electronic and offshore gaming platforms.\n\nIn a report last July 2024 during a Senate committee hearing, the government-owned and -controlled corporation revealed that it had identified and blocked a total of 5,793 illegal online gaming websites. These included platforms falsely claiming accreditation from the agency and using its logo in their promotional materials.\n\nThe agency has also previously said that it is eyeing the launch of its own online gaming platform, casinofilipino.com, in 2024, but there have been no updates as of writing.\n\nAI-manipulated: The supposed news report by Davila is fake. Deepfake detector tool TrueMedia.org labeled the video ad as AI manipulated with a 100% confidence rate in its analyses for detecting deepfake and AI-generated audio.\n\nSimilarly, Render.Ai flagged the video\u2019s audio as fake. This assessment is supported by noticeable mismatch between the lip movements of Davila and other individuals featured in the video and the accompanying narration.\n\nPragmatic, not Problematic: The company logo featured in the latter part of the video belongs to global iGaming provider \u201cPragmatic Play,\u201d not Problematic Play.\n\nOne clip in the ad features an interview with Pragmatic Play\u2019s Irina Cornides where she responds in English, contrary to the Tagalog or Filipino dialogue implied in the video. The original interview was conducted by EGR Global during the International Casino Exhibition 2023 in London.\n\nA search on its website shows that PH888.com is not on the list of games recognized by Pragmatic Play.\n\nDebunked: Rappler has previously fact-checked several AI-manipulated content. In 2024, AI-driven disinformation has become a prominent challenge in the information landscape.

            "article_content": "Tongyi Qianwen, Alibaba's large language model, on display during an expo in Shanghai last year. LONG WEI/FOR CHINA DAILY\n\nChinese startup DeepSeek has made a significant mark in the generative AI landscape with the groundbreaking release of its latest large-scale language model (LLM), which is comparable to leading models from heavyweights like OpenAI.\n\nDeepSeek's V3 model, trained for just two months using significantly fewer computing resources, delivers performance on par with the world's top proprietary model, GPT-4o, at a much lower cost than its rivals, according to the Hangzhou-based firm.\n\nDeepSeek-V3 makes it \"look easy today with an open weights release of a frontier-grade LLM trained on a joke of a budget (2,048 GPUs for 2 months, $6M)\", posted Andrej Karpathy, a founding member of OpenAI, on social media platform X.\n\n\"This is such clean engineering under resource constraints\u2026all of this looks so elegant,\" said Tim Dettmers, a research scientist at Allen AI, on X.\n\nDeepSeek's new open-source tool exemplifies a shift in China's AI ambitions, signaling that merely catching up to ChatGPT is no longer the goal. Instead, Chinese tech firms are now focused on delivering more affordable and versatile AI services.\n\nAccording to a 2024 report by the China Internet Network Information Center, 230 million users in China had registered for using generative AI-powered products as of June 2024.\n\nIn November, the Beijing-based AI startup Shengshu Technology unveiled its image-to-video tool called Vidu-1.5, capable of generating a video from as few as three input images within 30 seconds while establishing logical relationships among those objects in a scene.\n\nIts impressive performance has quickly garnered widespread admiration in both the AI community and the film industry.\n\nSony's Venom: The Last Dance, screened in China in October, was accompanied by an elegant Chinese ink-style promotional video crafted by Vidu. In the clip, ink blossoms across the screen as Venom morphs into a war horse, fish and crane, before playfully turning into a Kongming Lantern.\n\nUsing traditional film methods to produce a 30-second trailer typically takes about 30 days, but with Vidu, it only takes 10 working days and saves nearly 90 percent on post-production costs, said Zhang Xudong, product director of Shengshu Technology.\n\nAI design can also inspire artists, offering new creative ideas beyond expectations, Zhang added.\n\nIn March, Wang Feng and his team at East China Normal University unveiled a million-word AI-generated fantasy novel, Heavenly Mandate Apostle, crafted with a homegrown large language model. \"This novel was completed in just a month and a half, a feat that would take a dedicated human author a full year to match,\" Wang said.\n\nThe team later launched their second AI-generated novel, The Awakening at the Machine Epoch, which features a more gripping narrative, averaging 1.5 conflicts per chapter compared to the 1.2 in their first work.\n\nThe Xingye chatbot, developed by Shanghai-based startup MiniMax, uses AI to enable users to interact with a virtual romantic partner. However, its youthful user base has fostered a unique \"community vibe,\" as the app combines an AI chatbot with a collectible card system, creating a dynamic platform for user-generated content.\n\nThe chatbot is drawing in a variety of internet culture enthusiasts, ranging from anime and comic fans to cosplayers and gamers, who use AI virtual characters to collaboratively create unique narratives deeply resonant with their respective communities.\n\nXingye's international version, Talkie, along with another Chinese AI companion app, Poly.ai, ranked among the top 10 most downloaded AI apps in the United States during the first half of 2024.\n\nAlibaba's Tongyi LLM, specializing in digital avatar tech, has recently gained internet fame with its \"All-People's Stage\" feature. This innovative feature transforms static photos into dynamic singing or dancing videos, setting a new trend in entertainment.\n\nIn June, during a gala on China Central Television, Tongyi's AI-generated technology enabled Terracotta Warriors to perform the traditional Chinese art form of Huayin old tune.\n\nHowever, the misuse of talking head technology has led to a surge in fake content, such as rewriting the classic Dream of the Red Chamber as a martial arts story.\n\nLast month, China's broadcasting watchdog issued new rules to strengthen oversight, highlighting the country's commitment to closely monitoring the rapid growth of AI.\n\nXinhua"

But a recent viral video of clouds shows something unfamiliar, and has left social media confused on what it actually is.\n\n\u201cA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?\u201d stated a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, Myra Moor, while posting the video on her X account. She also added several hashtags such as #paranormal, #aliens to her video post.\n\nThe video was purportedly filmed by a plane passenger on a commercial airline. A close look at the video shows what looks like two human beings standing on cloud cover. The camera then pans to show several other such figures in the sky.\n\n\u2018Are those angels\u2026\u2019 The viral video has garnered nearly 5 million views on X. While many claimed those could either be angels, or sky scrapers poking into the sky, several others gave logical explanations stating that it could be smoke stacks.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s wild. Are those angels? Something big is coming. 2025 is going to be a crazy year. Buckle up,\u201d commented one user.\n\nSome other users refused to believe the video was real.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. If a normal human was recording this we would be zoomed in staring straight at the things until the plane was out of sight,\u201d added another user.\n\n\u2018Steam rising from exhaust stacks\u2026\u2019 \u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks,\u201d an X user explained.\n\nAlso Read | Squid Game 2 comes to Mumbai: Indian influencers fight for survival\n\nAnother person shared a similar response: \u201cI got an answer from a highly experienced pilot, \u2018Probably smoke stacks or cooling towers below the cloud layer. Looks like a very low fog layer. And this isn't the tower itself but the actual steam coming out of them rising above the fog.\u2019\u201d"

(Photo Credits: X)\n\nA mysterious video making rounds on social media has sparked curiosity and confusion. The footage, captured by a passenger from a commercial flight, shows multiple human-like figures standing on top of clouds. While the location and timing of the video remain unclear, it has caught the attention of many after the clip shared by Myra Moore, a self claimed paranormal expert. In her post, Moore was herself fascinated with the strange sight and asked others to share their opinion on the unusual scene above the Earth. The video has led to various conspiracy theories, as some humorously suggested the figures are just people on a snowy landscape, while others speculate it could be steam from industrial gases rising through a fog.\n\nTaking to X(Formerly Twitter), the paranormal expert asked, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there.

It aims to inspire the next generation of Saudi thinkers, innovators, and problem-solvers by encouraging critical thinking, creativity, and lifelong learning. The community in Saudi Arabia will have access to a wide range of educational videos designed to spark curiosity and foster deeper engagement in STEM fields, TikTok said.\n\n\n\nTikTok\u2019s STEM feed provides a unique viewing experience, providing a platform for co-learning and collaboration. It also supports TikTok\u2019s broader goal of content discovery and community building, ensuring the community can easily access enriching and inspiring content.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the STEM feed will be regionally optimised in collaboration with local partners such as Majarra, a leading provider of high-quality, useful, and credible Arabic content online, to ensure it meets the highest standards of scientific accuracy and relevance to Saudi Arabia\u2019s developmental goals. As part of its long-term vision, TikTok plans to cultivate additional partnerships with top educational platforms, expanding the feed\u2019s offerings and further enhancing its impact on STEM education in the region.\n\n\n\nA key part of the STEM feed\u2019s success will come from its vibrant creator community. A diverse range of creators, educators, and STEM enthusiasts will share content that sparks curiosity and promotes hands-on learning. By showcasing these creators from Saudi Arabia and beyond, the STEM feed will become a dynamic resource for youth to explore STEM careers and ignite their passion for discovery.\n\n\n\nGlobally, STEM-related communities on TikTok have already proven to be a massive success, with almost 10 million STEM-related videos published globally in the last three years. From hands-on experiments to tutorials on coding and engineering principles, the platform offers endless opportunities for creators and the community to share their knowledge and passion."

            "article_content": "Microsoft suggests that OpenAI\u2019s o1 Mini and GPT 4o Mini consist of 100 billion and 8 billion parameters, respectively.\n\nA new research by Microsoft estimates the size of some of the most powerful AI models that exist today \u2013 a feature that is otherwise kept a secret. Microsoft suggests that Claude 3.5 Sonnet consists of 175 billion parameters, and the o1 Preview has 300 billion parameters.\n\nThe tech company also suggests that OpenAI\u2019s small models, the o1 Mini and the GPT 4o Mini, consist of 100 billion and 8 billion parameters, respectively.\n\nThis has got people excited. GPT-4o Mini is a powerful model from OpenAI that ranks higher than the larger GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, and is comparable to the latest Llama 3.3 70B, according to a quality index from Artificial Analysis.\n\nAn 8B parameter model has the potential to be embedded into portable devices for local use. In a post on X, Yuchen Jin, CTO of Hyperbolic Labs, asked OpenAI chief Sam Altman, \u201cWould you consider open-sourcing GPT-4o-mini? It could run on our local devices.\u201d\n\nHowever, some speculate that the GPT-4o mini, like the GPT-4o, is a \u2018mixture of experts (MoE) model\u2019 that uses a small and specialised model within itself to solve different parts of a problem.\n\nOscar Le, CEO of SnapEdit, one of the most popular AI photo editing apps, said, \u201cMy bet is 4o-mini is an MoE with a total of around 40B params (parameters) and probably 8B active.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw that it holds significantly more knowledge (when asking about facts) than an 8B model while being quite fast. Besides, GPT-4o is MoE, so they likely use the same architecture for mini,\u201d he added in a post on X.\n\nMicrosoft experimented with the above models in their research to develop a benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes. However, this isn\u2019t an exact number of the parameter count.\n\n\u201cThe exact numbers of parameters of several LLMs have not been publicly disclosed yet. Most numbers of parameters are estimate reported to provide more context for understanding the models\u2019 performance,\u201d Microsoft said in the research.\n\nOpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have not released a detailed technical report outlining the architectural details and techniques used to build their latest models. This is likely due to concerns about revealing proprietary technology. For context, GPT-4, released in 2023, was the last model from OpenAI to carry a technical report.\n\nHowever, companies like Microsoft and Chinese AI giants Alibaba\u2019s Qwen and DeepSeek have released detailed technical documentation of their models. Recently, Microsoft\u2019s Phi-4 models released all the details of the model.\n\nIn an interview with AIM, Harkirat Behl, one of the creators of Microsoft\u2019s Phi-4 models, said that the company is taking a different approach from OpenAI\u2019s or Google\u2019s. \u201cWe have actually even given all the secret recipes [of the model] and techniques which are very complicated, and nobody in the world has implemented these techniques.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the paper, we have released all those details. That\u2019s how much we love open source here at Microsoft,\u201d Behl added.\n\n\u2018Bigger Models are Not All You Need\u2019\n\nOver the last few years, the parameter count of AI models has been trending downward, and the latest revelation substantiates this trend. Last year, EpochAI unveiled the parameters of multiple frontier models, like GPT 4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\nAfter Microsoft, EpochAI also revealed that GPT-4o has 200 billion parameters. EpochAI said that 3.5 Sonnet has around 400 billion parameters, a stark contrast to Microsoft\u2019s estimate of 175 billion parameters. Irrespective, this suggests that AI models are done prioritising the parameter count.\n\nBetween GPT-1 and GPT-3, parameter counts were multiplied by 1,000 times, and another 10 times from 175 billion to 1.8 trillion parameters between GPT-3 and GPT-4. The multiplication factor, however, is being reversed.\n\n\u201cLet alone reaching the 10 trillion parameter mark, current frontier models such as the original GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet are probably an order of magnitude smaller than GPT-4,\u201d said Ege Erdil, a researcher at EpochAI in December last year.\n\nInitially, increasing the parameter size improved the model\u2019s performance. However, with time, increasing computation and parameter size did not scale the model further. The lack of availability of newer datasets also contributes to these diminishing returns.\n\n\u201cA model with more parameters is not necessarily better. It\u2019s generally more expensive to run and requires more RAM than a single GPU card can have,\u201d said Yann LeCun in a post on X.\n\nOwing to this, engineers have explored efficient techniques on an architecture level to scale models. One such technique is the MoE, which the GPT-4o and the 4o Mini reportedly operate with.\n\n\u201c[MoE is a] neural net consisting of multiple specialised modules, only one of which is run on any particular prompt. So the effective number of parameters used at any one time is smaller than the total number,\u201d LeCun further said.\n\nAs 2024 came to an end, the ecosystem witnessed models with innovative techniques that outperformed frontier models. Released in December, Microsoft\u2019s Phi-4 uses small and curated high-quality datasets to train the Phi-4 model. These outperform many leading models, including GPT-4o.\n\nJust a fortnight ago, DeepSeek released an open-source MoE model, the V3. Not only does it outperform GPT-4o in most tests, but it was also trained for just $5.576 million. For instance, GPT-4 was trained for $40 million, and Gemini Ultra took $30 million.\n\nSo, in 2025, we are likely to see more optimisation and scaling techniques that boost models to higher levels at significantly lower costs.\n\n\u201cModel size is stagnating or even decreasing, while researchers are now looking at the right problems \u2013 either test-time training or neurosymbolic approaches like test-time search, program synthesis, and symbolic tool use,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, creator of Keras and the ARC AGI benchmark, wrote on X.\n\n\u201cBigger models are not all you need. You need better ideas. Now the better ideas are finally coming into play,\u201d he added."

Illustration: Desk\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, widely regarded as the 'godfather of AI', has voiced strong opposition to OpenAI's move to transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit company, as per a recent report by Business Insider. In a statement shared by Encode, an organisation advocating for ethical AI, Hinton criticised the shift as a betrayal of the company's founding principles.\n\n\"OpenAI was established as a safety-focused nonprofit and made commitments to that mission in its charter,\" said Hinton, who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work in neural networks. \"It received significant tax and other benefits under that structure. Abandoning those commitments now sets a troubling precedent for others in the AI field.\"\n\nAs per Business Insider, Hinton's remarks align with legal efforts by Elon Musk, who cofounded OpenAI in 2015 but left its board in 2018. Musk has filed an injunction to block OpenAI's transition, arguing that the company is prioritising profits over its original goal of ensuring AI safety and public accountability.\n\nEncode has also lent its support to Musk's case. \"OpenAI's pivot to a profit-driven model shows why public oversight is crucial in shaping the future of transformative technologies,\" said Adam Billen, Encode's vice president of public policy, as per the Business Insider report.\n\nHinton, who left Google in 2023 to focus on ethical concerns in AI, has previously criticised OpenAI. At an October press conference, he described CEO Sam Altman as \"more focused on profits than safety,\" calling the situation \"unfortunate\".\n\nThe debate now comes as OpenAI, now valued at $157 billion after a recent $6.6 billion funding round, faces increasing scrutiny over its commercial ambitions, further states the report."

You should be a little bit pessimistic with yield predictions as well.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be in a situation where you have sold grain, but don\u2019t have that grain. At Tillage Day, Donal Moloney of Tirl\u00e1n explained that farmers can sell as little as 20t at a time when forward selling grain.\n\nIf you think about that, you could be selling small amounts of grain every week or every two weeks or even once a month to get an average price from the season.\n\nThis would be spreading risk - something similar to the Boortmalt pricing system where an average price is taken every week from the middle of April to the middle of September.\n\n2025 prices\n\nLooking ahead to prices and it is very hard to know where they will end up this season. There was a lift in prices in December.\n\nTeagasc economist Fiona Thorne estimated that prices could rise by 5% in 2025 at their recent Outlook Conference.\n\nThis prediction was based on the difference between historic predicted values of French wheat prices and the actual outcomes.\n\nTeagasc estimated an increase in EU cereal production and an increase in Irish cereal yields. Looking at costs and Teagasc placed fertiliser prices down 5%, but fertiliser use up on a whole-farm basis."

Some 10 to 20 women also worked at the observatory, but they were the \u201ccomputers\u201d\u2014a term used for lab assistants who performed calculations. In this case, the women looked for patterns in the starlight and recorded changes to the visible stars. Payne, under a graduate fellowship, had a different role from the other women.\n\nHer mentor Harlow Shapley initially urged Payne to continue the work of a computer, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, who had realized that variations in some stars\u2019 light could be used to measure distances. But Payne wasn\u2019t interested in Leavitt\u2019s project. \u201cInstead, she wanted to focus on the decades of mostly untouched spectroscopy plates,\u201d says Burns.\n\nNo institution had more of those emulsion plates preserving star signatures than Harvard. Another computer, Annie Jump Cannon, had started to classify stars based on their signatures. Payne wanted to build on this work, combining what she learned about the inner workings of atoms at Newnham with the recent scientific theories of physics and chemistry, to understand stars.\n\nThe physics of the stars\n\nPhysics research was accelerating at the time, and the discoveries and scientific theories were traveling across the globe.\n\nResearchers had figured out the source of the patterns on spectroscopy plates\u2014electrons shifting energy levels as they zipped around an atom\u2019s nucleus, an action that emits or absorbs light. The color of that light was specific to a particular atom, meaning an electron in a carbon atom would always absorb or emit the same amount of light to reach a zippier state or drop back to a relaxed state. Within a few years, experiments determined most of energies that kick electrons to different levels for many of the atomic elements."

            "article_content": "Every year brings the accounting industry new tools, tech buzzwords and promises of transformation. How do firms separate the noise from what truly delivers value?\n\nSilverfin\n\nTechnology certainly has the potential to change the way accountants work for the better, but it can be difficult to know which trends are worth the investment of time, effort and budget, and which will fade away.\n\nIn this wrap-up of 2024 and look ahead to 2025, we explore what\u2019s exciting accountants, what concerns them, and how they\u2019re using capabilities like AI to drive their next chapter of growth. Most importantly, we\u2019ll also touch on what your firm should consider to stay competitive in the year ahead.\n\nOver 75% of firms have invested more in technology this year\n\nAccording to the UK Accountancy Sector Outlook Report by HSBC UK and Accountancy Age, over 75% of firms have increased their technology spending year-on-year, reflecting the industry\u2019s growing willingness to invest in digital tools.\n\nHowever, 15% of firms acknowledge difficulties in adapting to technological advancements, suggesting that while most are keen to innovate, some still face challenges in keeping up.\n\nFirms are actively exploring AI, with over 30% already integrating it into their operations and a further 23% planning to adopt it in 2025. This growing interest in AI reflects its potential to improve processes and support growth.\n\nTechnology adoption is not a one-size-fits-all journey\n\nThe report highlights an important point: technology adoption looks different for every firm. While the entire industry recognises the importance of digital transformation, it seems as if priorities and strategies differ significantly based on firm size and resources.\n\nLarge firms are scaling and optimising\n\nBigger firms are leading the charge in technology adoption, with 37.5% significantly increasing their tech investments. Their focus has shifted from adopting new tools to optimising existing systems to maximise value and efficiency.\n\nMid-sized firms are focused on balanced growth\n\nAmong mid-sized firms, 58.3% report somewhat increased spending on technology, reflecting a steady and measured approach. These firms often aim to scale their operations without overextending resources, focusing on incremental improvements to existing systems.\n\nSmaller firms are in a catch-up phase\n\nThese firms seem to be focusing on foundational investments like cloud computing and process automation. While they may lack the budgets of larger firms, their investments are driven by the need to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market. These firms often prioritise solutions that deliver immediate efficiency gains without significant risk.\n\n39% of firms are using full-suite solutions\n\nThe results of a recent LinkedIn survey run by Phil Hobden, Silverfin\u2019s Head of Sales, provide valuable insights into the technologies currently being used by accounting practices.\n\nThe findings show that the majority (39%) of respondents are using full-suite software solutions such as Iris, CCH and Digita. These tools, known for their comprehensive features, enable firms to handle multiple aspects of accounting efficiently within a single platform.\n\nInterestingly, 21% of participants reported using specialist software like Caseware and Alphatax, suggesting that many firms are seeking tailored tools to meet specific needs.\n\nSimilarly,18% have transitioned to 100% cloud-based platforms, like Silverfin, highlighting the ongoing shift towards cloud technology for its flexibility and real-time collaboration capabilities.\n\nThe power of cloud computing is evolving\n\nCloud-based accounting software is playing an increasingly important role, making financial data accessible from anywhere and enabling teams to collaborate in real time. This flexibility helps firms manage tasks more efficiently and reduces the risk of errors by automating manual processes.\n\nBeyond these practical benefits, cloud-based software can connect with other tools to create systems that simplify workflows and improve accuracy. For instance, firms can link cloud accounting platforms with tools for analytics, payroll or client management.\n\nRecent investments, such as KPMG\u2019s $100 million partnership with Google Cloud, demonstrate the rising demand for cloud infrastructure. Over the past two years, bookings for KPMG's services related to Google Cloud have increased tenfold.\n\n\"We believe that professional services is going through the largest transformation that it will likely ever go through.\" \u2013 Steve Chase, vice chair of AI and innovation for KPMG\n\nCloud technology and AI are closely linked, as cloud platforms provide the scalable computing power and data storage required to run AI applications effectively. By hosting AI tools on the cloud, firms can process large volumes of data quickly, access advanced analytics, and deploy solutions that adapt to changing needs without investing heavily in on-premises hardware. For instance, AI-driven applications often rely on the cloud to handle complex calculations and store real-time data securely.\n\nAI is being harnessed for the next chapter of growth\n\nIn recent years, AI has rapidly gained traction, evolving from a niche technology into a mainstream trend. Its impact on every industry is undeniable and it has the potential to significantly boost the global economy. PwC estimates AI could add $15.7 trillion by 2030, with $6.6 trillion coming from productivity improvements as businesses automate tasks and enhance efficiency.\n\nIn the UK, AI is expected to contribute \u00a32 billion to GDP, with firms adopting it likely to see revenue grow three times faster than those that don\u2019t. In accounting, AI is improving accuracy, streamlining processes, and helping firms adapt to new challenges, with 61% of accountants seeing it as more of an opportunity than a risk. However, not everyone is fully convinced.\n\nSome accountants are voicing concerns about AI\n\nWhile AI offers exciting possibilities for the accounting profession, it\u2019s not without its challenges. According to a Karbon\u2019s State of AI in Accounting study, many accountants worry about the potential downsides of automation. For instance, 56% are concerned that AI could undermine the \"human touch\" in client relationships, making interactions feel less personal and more transactional.\n\nData security also looms large as a concern, with 76% of respondents identifying it as a key issue. Ethical considerations, such as bias in AI systems and the transparency of AI-driven decisions, trouble nearly half (49%) of accountants surveyed. These worries reflect broader anxieties about how AI will be integrated into professional settings without compromising fairness and accountability.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that AI is far from a replacement for the expertise that accountants bring to their work. Strategic thinking, client understanding and ethical judgment remain areas where human professionals excel. Instead, AI serves as a tool to handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for accountants to strengthen client relationships and add greater value to their firms.\n\nThe road ahead will involve finding a balance \u2013 harnessing AI to drive innovation while preserving the trust, personal connections and ethical foundations that define the profession.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nThe future of AI in accounting looks bright, with advancements expected to help firms navigate new regulations and deliver more specialised tools for tasks like tax calculations and financial reporting. Emerging technologies such as quantum computing could amplify these benefits, making processes even faster and more efficient. By adopting AI responsibly and addressing its ethical considerations, firms can remain competitive while supporting their teams and clients.\n\nBlockchain technology is another field to watch, with its potential to transform auditing and assurance by automating processes with smart contracts and enhancing transparency. Its decentralised design could be used to reduce the risk of fraud and build trust in financial transactions. This is certainly a new frontier for accounting firms to explore in the years to come!\n\nAs we look ahead to 2025 and beyond, Silverfin is here to help you discover and embrace new possibilities in accounting.

            "article_content": "Tech mogul Elon Musk intensified his legal battle with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in the days after Christmas. Court filings show two prominent tech investors lending support to the billionaire\u2019s allegations that the company unfairly blocked potential backers from investing in its rivals. The dispute between the world\u2019s richest person and one of the world\u2019s most valuable start-ups sets up a potential court battle over OpenAI\u2019s future. The artificial intelligence developer is trying to restructure itself to remove the oversight of its nonprofit board, freeing it to pursue profits more like a conventional tech company.\n\nMusk is asking a federal court in Northern California to block OpenAI from changing its structure, arguing that a nonprofit can\u2019t walk away from its original mandate backed by donors like himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk helped found OpenAI in 2015 and was a major funder of the project before splitting with his co-founders in 2018 after attempting to take control of the project.\n\nThe billionaire also wants OpenAI to be prohibited from forcing its investors to decline to support competing AI companies, such as his own AI start-up, xAI.\n\nMusk\u2019s company, which offers the chatbot Grok, announced $6 billion of new funding last week from investors including Morgan Stanley and an investment fund associated with the Saudi royal family.\n\nAlso last week, progressive tech advocacy organization Encode filed a friend-of-the-court brief expressing support for Musk\u2019s claims against OpenAI. Encode\u2019s filing was backed by several AI researchers, including Geoffrey Hinton, a former Google researcher who shared a Nobel Prize last year for his work on AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused non-profit and made a variety of safety related promises in its charter,\u201d Hinton said in a statement released by Encode. \u201cAllowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kathy Jennings, the attorney general for Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, filed a brief in the case saying she was talking with the company about its plans and would step in if she believed it was breaking the law.\n\nMusk added new support from prominent tech investors to his legal assault on OpenAI in sworn declarations filed late last week by the entrepreneur and three allies.\n\nThey alleged that OpenAI told potential investors last year that they could back the company only if they committed not to invest in rival AI developers, including Musk\u2019s AI start-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAntonio Gracias, CEO of investment firm Valor Equity Partners, which has invested in xAI, said in a filing that it was widely known among investors that OpenAI had made withholding from investments in competitors a provision of its latest funding round.\n\nGavin Baker, managing partner of hedge fund Atreides Management, which has invested in Musk ventures including electric automaker Tesla, said in his own declaration that the competitor investment ban was common knowledge among top tech investors.\n\nGracias and Baker did not claim in the filings to have heard directly from OpenAI\u2019s leaders about the alleged condition placed on prospective investors in the company.\n\nJared Birchall, chief financial officer of Musk\u2019s xAI and a longtime lieutenant to the billionaire, said in his own declaration filed with the court that an unspecified \u201creputable venture capital investor\u201d told him of the restriction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Deutrom, a spokesperson for OpenAI, referred to a Dec. 13 court filing in which the company said that it did not bar its investors from also backing competitors. Investors were told that they would not receive competitively sensitive information from OpenAI if they chose to also invest in rivals to the company, the filing said.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a December interview with the Free Press that Musk was \u201cclearly a bully.\u201d\n\nThe battle between Musk and Altman, two of the tech world\u2019s most powerful men, erupted into public view last February.\n\nMusk sued OpenAI and Altman that month in state court in San Francisco. He alleged the company\u2019s leaders tricked him and others into supporting a company pledged to bettering humanity, but pivoted it into a for-profit enterprise. He later dropped the suit but filed a similar one in August in federal court in California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI announced in October that it had raised $6.6 billion in new investment funding, valuing the company at $157 billion. The following month, Musk widened his suit to also allege that OpenAI worked with its main backer, Microsoft, to unfairly squash competition in AI. Microsoft has denied the allegations in court filings."

Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs cases\n\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs \u2014 founder of Bad Boy Records and the Sean John brand \u2014 is due to stand trial in federal court in Manhattan on May 5 on a sex-trafficking indictment that could send him to prison for life. Prosecutors have also warned that a second indictment is imminent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven what's already in the record, trial testimony and evidence will be graphic, and the courtroom jousting will be heated. Combs' defense is that he never forced anyone to have sex, and that his accusers have financial motive to implicate him. The trial will likely focus on consent and credibility.\n\nCombs' mother and his six oldest children \u2014 who range from teenagers to early 30s \u2014 have attended pretrial hearings, waving and smiling at him from the audience. The trial may prove less family-friendly. The evidence includes hundreds of hours of videotape from the rap mogul's sex parties \u2014 especially from his so-called freak-off performances, along with testimony by male sex workers who attended the parties. The trial will not be televised.\n\nSeparately, Combs faces more than 30 civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual abuse. \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted, or sex trafficked anyone,\" his attorneys recently said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuigi Mangione, the suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is awaiting trials on murder charges. Pamela Smith/AP\n\nLuigi Mangione court case\n\nLuigi Mangione, a 26-year-old software developer from a Maryland real estate family, will face state and federal murder charges in Manhattan this year in the December ambush shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. He risks a maximum sentence of life in prison and, in the federal case, the death penalty \u2014 though it has been more than 60 years since a Manhattan jury has sent anyone to death row.\n\nBoth the state and federal prosecutions are in their early days. While Mangione has pleaded not guilty in his state case, he is not set to enter a plea to his federal indictment until later this month.\n\nIt's possible Mangione will go to trial in 2025, though it's unlikely. His attorney suggested prior to taking the case that he could pursue some kind of psychiatric defense, which could delay the trial into 2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump continues to fight for a clean rap sheet and to zero out his civil judgments. AP Photo/Evan Vucci\n\nDonald Trump's court cases\n\nThe president-elect's criminal indictments have sputtered to a halt, thanks in large part to the US Supreme Court's July presidential immunity decision. Loose ends remain in the Manhattan hush-money case, as Trump works to clear his rap sheet of its sole conviction before his January 20 inauguration.\n\nThere is still no sentencing date, and New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan has yet to rule on Trump's demand that the case be tossed in the interest of justice, given the election. Also pending is Trump's Second Circuit appellate efforts to move the hush-money case to federal court.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump begins 2025 with a half-billion-dollars in civil court judgments hanging over his head, all of which he's in the midst of aggressively appealing, including his two E. Jean Carroll defamation cases. A midlevel New York appellate court could keep, trim, or overturn the biggest of Trump's judgments at any time \u2014 his massive civil fraud penalty, a debt to New York state that remains frozen on appeal, which has now ballooned to $490 million with interest. He remains a defendant in eight civil cases brought by injured Capitol Police officers and members of Congress involving his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Supreme Court could strike down the law banning TikTok from app stores. Gearstd/iStock, Tyler Le/BI\n\nTikTok ban\n\nIn the spring, Congress passed a law that would ban TikTok from app stores in the United States unless Bytedance, the platform's Chinese owner, divested itself from the app.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe deadline is January 19. Bytedance still owns TikTok. A Washington, DC-based appeals court was unpersuaded by TikTok's arguments that its users' First Amendment rights outweigh the national security-based reasoning of Congress's law.\n\nAll eyes are on the US Supreme Court to see whether it will strike down the law before the deadline. The court agreed to hear oral arguments in the case on January 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia faces a DOJ probe. Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nNvidia\n\nThe Justice Department has reportedly been ramping up an antitrust investigation into the chipmaker throughout 2024. Competitors have said Nvidia uses unfair marketing tactics to gain a stranglehold on the market for chips used in AI development, while the company says it simply offers a best-in-class product. If the DOJ brings a lawsuit or comes to a settlement with Nvidia, it'll likely come in 2025.\n\nMeta faces an antitrust lawsuit. Fabrice COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMeta antitrust lawsuit\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission sued Meta during the first Trump administration, alleging it had an illegal monopoly on the social media market through its ownership of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The Biden administration has kept up the lawsuit, which scored a major victory in November when a federal judge allowed most of the case to go to trial.\n\nMeta says the company's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram have been good for consumers. If it loses the trial \u2014 scheduled for April \u2014 the FTC will seek to force the company to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle has two ongoing antitrust battles. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nGoogle antitrust lawsuit\n\nGoogle search case\n\nAlphabet was dealt a major blow in 2024 when a federal judge concluded Google formed an illegal monopoly in the search market. Now the company is tussling with the Justice Department over how it should be punished. Google suggested it could pull back some of its partnerships with other companies. The DOJ has asked the judge to force Google to divest from its Chrome browser, a more dramatic move. The decision \u2014 and the many appeals to come \u2014 will continue to play out in 2025.\n\nGoogle advertising case\n\nAnother major Google antitrust case is over its role in online advertising. In September, a federal court held a bench trial to determine whether the company formed another illegal monopoly, in the adtech market.\n\nGoogle claims the Justice Department has overstated its role in the market, where it competes fiercely with the likes of Meta and Amazon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA decision is expected to come sometime in 2025, with appeals to follow.\n\nAmazon's antitrust trial is expected in 2026. Amazon\n\nAmazon antitrust lawsuit\n\nIn 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and a group of states sued Amazon, alleging it abused its dominance in the online retail space to inflate prices, squeeze third-party sellers with onerous fees, and push its in-house products at the expense of others. Amazon has said it does everything for the benefit of consumers, to whom it provides better products and better prices.\n\nIn September, a federal judge knocked down some of the states' claims but allowed the bulk of the lawsuit to proceed to trial. The trial date is scheduled for 2026, with more litigation and appeals expected to take place before then.\n\nOpenAI faces a lawsuit by The New York Times. NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nNew York Times vs OpenAI\n\nAll sorts of content creators \u2014 journalists, novelists, filmmakers, photographers \u2014 have filed a slew of copyright lawsuits against AI companies, accusing them of illegally siphoning their creations to train their AI models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI companies have generally argued that the use of the material is sufficiently \"transformative\" to be considered \"fair use\" under copyright law.\n\nOne of the major cases to watch is The New York Times's lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, which has progressed further than many of the other cases. In January, a federal judge is scheduled to oversee a marathon day of oral arguments over whether the case is on firm enough legal ground to proceed to trial.\n\nElon Musk vs Sam Altman and OpenAI\n\nIn the past few years, OpenAI has become a tech behemoth, setting the pace for generative artificial intelligence technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company is technically structured as a nonprofit that seeks to build artificial intelligence in a way that benefits all of humanity. However, under its leader Sam Altman, OpenAI has signed a lucrative deal with Microsoft, which hopes to harness the tech to drive its own growth.\n\nNow OpenAI is trying to formally convert itself into a for-profit company, shedding the nonprofit label. Musk \u2014 who was involved in OpenAI's early stages and who runs a competitor, xAI \u2014 is trying to stop that from happening.\n\nThe case has been moving at a fast clip, with lawyers for Musk and OpenAI dropping legal filings that reveal internal emails and other records about the other. It's set to continue heating up in 2025 as OpenAI tries to become a corporation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams' administration was in turmoil before he was indicted. New York Daily News/Getty Images\n\nEric Adams indictment\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan accused New York City Mayor Eric Adams of taking bribes from Turkey to fuel his political career \u2014 charges that he has strenuously denied. Adams hired Alex Spiro, a hard-charging lawyer best known for representing Musk, to fight the cases. The case is on the fast track and is expected to go to trial in April, before the city's Democratic primary.\n\nAn initial pretrial conference in the antitrust lawsuit against Apple is scheduled in February. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nDOJ's Apple antitrust lawsuit\n\nThe Justice Department sued Apple in March, accusing it of violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a smartphone monopoly. More than a dozen states have since joined the lawsuit against the tech giant, and the initial conference in the case will be held on February 27 in federal court in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nThe DOJ accuses Apple of making its rivals' products worse by selectively imposing contractual restrictions on developers and by withholding critical access points from them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple does this, according to the Justice Department, by suppressing the development of cloud-streaming apps and services, worsening the quality of cross-platform messaging with rivals like Android, limiting the functionality of third-party smartwatches unless the owners keep buying iPhones, blocking the development of \"super apps,\" and limiting functions on non-Apple wallet tap-to-pay.\n\nApple previously told Business Insider that if the lawsuit was successful, it could set a dangerous precedent by \"empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people's technology.\"\n\n\"This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,\" Apple said in a March 2024 statement to BI. \"If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple \u2014 where hardware, software, and services intersect.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe DOJ accuses Live Nation, Ticketmaster's parent company, of unlawfully dominating the live music market. Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nLive Nation Ticketmaster lawsuit\n\nA little over a year after the historic Ticketmaster crash, which prevented Taylor Swift fans from purchasing Eras tour tickets, the Justice Department in May sued Live Nation, the website's parent company.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe DOJ accuses Live Nation of unlawfully dominating the live music market, stifling innovation, and exerting control over how fans can purchase tickets and where artists can perform. It seeks to break up the company.\n\nA final pretrial conference is scheduled for February 12 in federal court in Manhattan, but the case isn't expected to go to trial until early 2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLive Nation previously told BI in a statement that the lawsuit would fail in court.\n\n\"The DOJ's lawsuit won't solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows,\" the company said in May.\n\nAn antitrust lawsuit brought by the DOJ says Visa handled more than 60% of US debit transactions, earning the company more than $7 billion in fees a year. Visa\n\nVisa antitrust lawsuit\n\nThe Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa in September, accusing the company of engaging in anticompetitive behavior with its US debit transactions. Initial hearings in the case are expected in January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the payment-processing giant of entering into contracts with potential competitors that prevent them from becoming actual competitors. By doing so, Visa is able to collect fees that it wouldn't be able to in a competitive market, the Justice Department alleges.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York, said Visa handled more than 60% of US debit transactions, earning the company more than $7 billion in fees a year.\n\nIn September, a lawyer for Visa told BI the lawsuit was \"meritless.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Today's lawsuit ignores the reality that Visa is just one of many competitors in a debit space that is growing, with entrants who are thriving,\" Julie Rottenberg said in a statement at the time.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is scheduled for a January 3 contempt hearing. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nRudy Giuliani defamation case\n\nThis will be the fourth year for the court battle between Rudy Giuliani and Georgia election workers Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss and Ruby Freeman.\n\nThe former Trump attorney and New York City mayor has owed Moss and Freeman $148 million since December 2023, after a DC judge found his repeated false accusations of election fraud subjected the mother-daughter pair to a barrage of racist death threats. The pair's lawyer complained in court recently that Giuliani has yet to turn over any assets beyond a handful of luxury watches, a Mercedes without a title, and a New York apartment without a current lease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiuliani now faces contempt of court for allegedly continuing to defame the pair on his nightly podcast and for what defense lawyers complain has been his heel-dragging in turning over assets and complying with subpoenas.\n\nHe is scheduled for a January 3 contempt hearing and a January 16 bench trial, both in federal court in Manhattan. The trial will determine if Giuliani must surrender his Palm Beach condo and three World Series rings."

            "article_content": "Advanced machine learning techniques, especially deep learning methods have greatly enhanced the capabilities of single and multi-modal information processing. Techniques like transfer learning and fine-tuning have allowed CNNs to be pre-trained on large datasets and then fine-tuned for specific tasks, improving performance and reducing the need for extensive labeled data. Attention mechanisms, such as those used in Transformer models, have further enhanced the performance of sequence models by allowing them to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. RNNs can process sequences by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous steps. LSTMs improve upon RNNs by addressing the vanishing gradient problem, enabling them to learn long-term dependencies. Multi-modal learning transfers knowledge between different modalities, such as text, speech, image, and video.\n\n\n\nThere are broader challenges that are faced by multi-modal machine learning, such as in representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. It is a multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Therefore, it is important to explore both single and multi-modal learning with advanced machine learning techniques.\n\n\n\nThis Research Topic will focus on advanced machine learning methods for single or multi-modal information processing. Topics include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Improvements to conventional machine learning\n\n- Ensemble Learning;\n\n- Reinforcement learning;\n\n- Deep neural networks;\n\n- Graph neural networks;\n\n- Multi-modal fusion;\n\n- Cross-modal learning;\n\n- Multi-modal Transformers;\n\n- Multi-modal representation learning;\n\n- Self-Supervised and Unsupervised Learning;\n\n- Efficient Models and Compression;\n\n- Interpretability and Robustness.\n\nArticle types and fees This Research Topic accepts the following article types, unless otherwise specified in the Research Topic description: Brief Research Report\n\nClinical Trial\n\nCommunity Case Study\n\nConceptual Analysis\n\nData Report\n\nEditorial\n\nGeneral Commentary\n\nHypothesis and Theory\n\nMethods\n\n...

            "article_content": "Centralized data networks, ones that are owned and/or managed by a single entity, have been structurally broken for years. Why? Single points of failure. If one entity (or even a few) has access to a database, then there is only one \u201cpoint\u201d to compromise in order to gain full access. This is a serious problem for networks holding sensitive data like customer information, government files, and financial records, and those with control of infrastructure like power grids.\n\nBillions of digital records were stolen in 2024 alone, causing an estimated $10 trillion in damages! Notable breaches include nearly all of AT&T\u2019s customer information and call logs, half of America\u2019s personal health information, 700 million end-user records from companies using Snowflake, 10 billion unique passwords stored on RockYou24, and Social Security records for 300 million Americans.\n\nSource: Statista, 2024\n\nThis is not just a private sector issue \u2014 governments and crucial national infrastructure also rely on centralized networks. Notable recent breaches include records on 22 million Americans stolen from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, sensitive government communications from multiple U.S. federal agencies, personal biometric data on 1.1 billion Indian citizens, and the ongoing Chinese infiltration of several U.S. internet service providers.\n\nAlthough hundreds of billions of dollars are spent each year on cyber security, data breaches are getting larger and happening more frequently. It\u2019s become clear that incremental products cannot fix these network vulnerabilities \u2014 the infrastructure must be completely rearchitected.\n\nSource: market.us, 2024\n\nAI magnifies the issue\n\nRecent advancements in generative AI have made it easier to automate everyday tasks and enhance work productivity. But the most useful and valuable AI applications require context, i.e. access to sensitive user health, financial, and personal information. Because these AI models also require massive computing power, they largely can\u2019t run on consumer devices (computer, mobile), and instead must access public cloud networks, like AWS, to process more complex inference requests. Given the serious limitations inherent in centralized networks illustrated earlier, the inability to securely connect sensitive user data with cloud AI has become a significant hurdle for adoption.\n\nEven Apple pointed this out during their announcement for Apple Intelligence earlier this year, stating the need to be able to enlist help from larger, more complex models in the cloud and how the traditional cloud model isn\u2019t viable anymore.\n\nThey name three specific reasons:\n\nPrivacy and security verification: Providers' claims, like not logging user data, often lack transparency and enforcement. Service updates or infrastructure troubleshooting can inadvertently log sensitive data. Runtime lacks transparency: Providers rarely disclose software details, and users cannot verify if the service runs unmodified or detect changes, even with open-source tools. Single point of failure: Administrators require high-level access for maintenance, risking accidental data exposure or abuse by attackers targeting these privileged interfaces.\n\nFortunately, Web3 cloud platforms offer the perfect solution.\n\nBlockchain-Orchestrated Confidential Cloud (BOCC)\n\nBOCC networks are like AWS \u2014 except built completely on confidential hardware and governed by smart contracts. Though still early days, this infrastructure has been in development for years and is finally starting to onboard Web3 projects and Web2 enterprise customers. The best example of this architecture is Super Protocol, an off-chain enterprise-grade cloud platform managed completely by on-chain smart contracts and built on trustless execution environments (TEEs). These are secure hardware enclaves that keep code and data verifiably confidential and secure.\n\nSource: Super Protocol\n\nThe implications of this technology address all of Apple\u2019s concerns noted earlier:\n\nPrivacy and security verification: With public smart contracts orchestrating the network, users can verify whether user data was transported and used as promised. Workload and program transparency: The network also verifies the work done within the confidential TEEs, cryptographically proving the correct hardware, data, and software were used, and that the output wasn\u2019t tampered with. This information is also submitted on-chain for all to audit. Single point of failure: Network resources (data, software, hardware) are only accessible by the owner\u2019s private key. Therefore, even if one user is compromised, only that user\u2019s resources are at risk.\n\nWhile cloud AI represents an enormous opportunity for Web3 to disrupt, BOCCs can be applied to any type of centralized data network (power grid, digital voting infrastructure, military IT, etc.), to provide superior and verifiable privacy and security, without sacrificing performance or latency. Our digital infrastructure has never been more vulnerable, but blockchain-orchestration can fix it."

            "article_content": "When many people hear the word \u201ccamp,\u201d images of summer excursions full of hiking, canoeing, craft making and new friends leap to mind. And, while Camp Susque certainly offers those things, the organization also functions as a beacon of community goodwill.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we struggle with is, there\u2019s that impression. Some people ask, \u2018what do you do the rest of the year?\u2019 We are a year round camp. There is always something going on at Susque,\u201d said Peter Swift, executive director for the camp for the past 10 years.\n\nSwift\u2019s family has a long history with the camp, dating back to 1947, when his grandfather, Bob Dittmar, founded the camp. In the 1990\u2019s, Swift\u2019s parents filled the very role he holds today, and his younger brother is the current operations director.\n\n\u201cWe have a deep and inviting love for the ministry, so my family just keeps coming back,\u201d Swift said.\n\nSome of the more traditional camp-oriented offerings Susque is known for include overnight residential and family summer camps, wilderness trips during the summer and short term \u201ctry it out\u201d camps for younger kids.\n\n\u201cWe like to be a resource to the community anytime there\u2019s any kind of crisis, especially locally in Trout Run, whether it\u2019s weather related, like the hurricane this summer, or whether it\u2019s an extended power outage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe camp was instrumental in helping area residents stay connected in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, as schoolwork turned remote.\n\n\u201cWe are blessed with exceptionally good internet, so we set up antennas in our parking lot and offered drive-in WiFi, where students that needed to do remote work, or have a Zoom meeting, but didn\u2019t have the internet, could just come to our parking lot and do it there,\u201d Swift said.\n\nAdditionally, the camp opened its facilities to healthcare professionals and first responders that may need to self isolate.\n\nDuring the 2020-21 school year, as hybrid learning took hold, working with local school districts and county commissioners, the camp would rent out eight churches throughout the city, during the weekdays, when they are largely empty, and hire 80 staff, starting what they called \u201cschool learning sites,\u201d Swift explained.\n\n\u201cWe ended up serving more kids that fall than we would have through our summer camps,\u201d he said.\n\nThe initiative was a win-win for the camp.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a Christian organization, and for us, that was an opportunity to do gospel ministry, to connect with these kids. We included Bible studies as an optional part of it. We gave kids the option to opt out. We didn\u2019t want to force our beliefs on anyone,\u201d Swift said.\n\n\u201cOur mission is Biblical evangelism and growth of Christian character for youth, young adults and families, and finding a way to do that in the midst of the pandemic was really cool. And we put it together in two weeks,\u201d Swift said, proudly.\n\nMore recently, the camp was heavily involved in recovery efforts following the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene.\n\n\u201cThis summer, when there was the hurricane and Trout Run was flooding, we hosted families that were displaced and we provided laundry and shower facilities,\u201d Swift explained.\n\n\u201cWe have good backup generators and internet and things like that, so it\u2019s a good and safe place to come, if you, for some reason, can\u2019t be in your home,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the firehall not yet fully operational, the camp has taken on several of its normal services, including hosting Red Cross blood drives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been involved with disaster relief. The fire company knows that if there\u2019s a family that\u2019s displaced, they can come to Susque,\u201d Swift said.\n\nCamp Susque\u2019s reach extends far beyond the bounds of home, as they partnered with Heather Newhart, of Compassion Campers, and others to purchase and send 29 RVs to Tennessee and North Carolina to house families displaced by Helene\u2019s affects.\n\n\u201cA number of our staff have driven the RVs down there, and they\u2019re doing that on their own dime,\u201d Swift said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking time off from work. They\u2019re paying for gas. It\u2019s been a pretty amazing thing to see,\u201d he said.\n\nA big part of fulfilling the camp\u2019s mission and community outreach has been securing a way for each prospective camper to meet the sometimes hefty cost of enrollment.\n\n\u201cWe are about 1/5 of the national average when it comes to cost for residential camps, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re cheap,\u201d Swift said, explaining that the average cost per camper is around $600, while the national average is closer to $3,000.\n\n\u201cWe only collect around $350 to $400 after discounts, financial aid and scholarships, and that gap is primarily made up for by our community and our alumni making donations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe never want someone to avoid coming to camp because of the price. We do not turn people down for financial aid,\u201d Swift stressed.\n\n\u201cWe want everybody to have that opportunity. We want to encourage people, don\u2019t be daunted by the sticker price,\u201d he said.\n\nThose opportunities continue to grow as Swift and co. continue to pursue new ways to serve the community, as they wrap up a capital campaign for the construction of a new handicap accessible pool.\n\nA gap year program for recent high school graduates to take the time to decide their next path in life before entering college or the workforce is also under development by Camp Susque at two properties they acquired during the pandemic, Swift said.\n\n\u201cIn the interim, we\u2019ve primarily been providing either emergency housing or respite housing for families with domestic issues or pastoral retreats,\u201d he said.\n\nSwift credits the success of the camp to its staff as well as its alumni base.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of our staff, both our year round staff and our summer staff. They\u2019re just the highest quality,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd our alumni are incredible. I\u2019m always amazed by them. We\u2019ve been around for 77 years now, and I\u2019m really impressed by the Susque community and how generous they are with their time, their talents and their wallets,\u201d Swift said.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that surprises a lot of people about Susque is that we don\u2019t have an endowment, we\u2019re not affiliated with a church. It\u2019s just the community and our alumni base that takes care of us,\u201d he explained.\n\nAdditionally, Swift gives great credit to the camp\u2019s continued dedication to the word of God.\n\n\u201cOur mission has remained consistent, and I think as long as we faithfully and doggedly pursue that mission, God provides for us through his people and we\u2019re very blessed to be able to kind of a front row seat for all of that,\u201d he said."

The thickness of the fog, its appearance under a flashlight, and the respiratory symptoms some have reported after exposure led many to theorize about chemical attacks, bioweapons testing, and, of course, aliens.\n\nFeatured Video\n\nSo far, there has been no confirmation that there is anything nefarious about any fog in any part of the world, but with mistrust in the government at high levels, this hasn\u2019t slowed the spread of frightened posting.\n\nNow everyone in TikTok is afraid of the fog pic.twitter.com/Trt4bOXEJN \u2014 UAE Exotic Falconry & Finance\ud80c\udd43 (@FalconryFinance) December 31, 2024\n\nWhat are the fog conspiracy theories?\n\nStarting on Dec. 29, social media users on conspiracy-heavy platforms like TikTok and X began publishing videos about a nefarious fog that seemed unusually thick or made of large particles. Some reported an odd smell described as chemical, electrical, or burning, and then claimed to experience fever, coughing, sore throat, headache, and fatigue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese symptoms drew COVID-19 comparisons and soon led to the term \u201cFogvid-24.\u201d As an echo of the conspiracy theories around the virus, some claim that government forces are surely deploying the fog as a means to spread a new pathogen, either as an experiment or an attack.\n\nReports from around the globe are surfacing of mysterious illnesses linked to encounters with so-called \u201cchemical fogs.\u201d\n\n\n\nDescribed as a thick, lingering blanket, the fog has left people sick\u2014many experiencing sudden cold or flu-like symptoms after only brief exposure.\n\n\n\nDubbed\u2026 pic.twitter.com/DQqnrsYKzd \u2014 Shadow of Ezra (@ShadowofEzra) December 30, 2024\n\n\u201cReports from around the globe are surfacing of mysterious illnesses linked to encounters with so-called \u2018chemical fogs,\u2019\u201d writes X account @ShadowofEzra. \u201cDescribed as a thick, lingering blanket, the fog has left people sick\u2014many experiencing sudden cold or flu-like symptoms after only brief exposure.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAround the globe\u201d may be an exaggeration, however. Most if not all of these reports appear to come from the U.K. (which is famous for its fog) or areas of the U.S., including Florida.\n\n\u201cFlorida, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, California, Texas and basically all over the country people are reporting this same thick \u2018particle fog,\u2019\u201d tweeted @WallStreetApes. \u201cThey say it\u2019s making them feel sick, smells like chemicals, and is not normal.\u201d\n\nSkeptics react\n\nConsidering how prolific they have become thanks to the internet, many users are quick to dismiss anything that smacks of a conspiracy theory. Theories on the fog are no exception, especially as believers and skeptics appear to fall along political lines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose reporting on the fog as though it\u2019s a government plot (or aliens) tend to lean conservative, with histories of anti-government posts or handles like \u201c@BGatesIsAPsycho.\u201d Skeptics, on the other hand, tend to lean left and are wasting no time insulting those who want to believe.\n\n\u201cThe delusional throbbers that believe this stupidity need to give their heads a massive wobble,\u201d writes @BSmithBenS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOthers have suggested that conspiracy theories like this demonstrate a need for traditional news media, heavy on fact-checking.\n\nWhat could explain the mysterious fog?\n\nAs the term \u201cthe fog\u201d trends on X, many posts come with videos of people shining flashlights into the mist, allowing viewers to see individual particles swirling around. This led to widespread alarm among those unaware that fog is actually made of small water or ice particles that reflect light.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA video from 2015 by a YouTube user testing out his LED flashlights shows the same effect. This is, in fact, how fog normally looks under concentrated light.\n\nAs for cold or flu-like symptoms, it\u2019s possible that people are simply catching COVID-19 or another common respiratory virus over the holidays. Some of those sounding the alarm say that the fog appeared on Christmas Day when they likely would have spent time indoors with a group of loved ones.\n\nEvery year since 2020, the late fall and early winter holidays have brought a spike in COVID cases, as has always been the same with contagious and seasonal respiratory illnesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArtificial fog machine patent fuels conspiracy theories\n\nNot everything about these conspiracy theories can be easily explained away, including the reported chemical smells. Meanwhile, people keep digging up additional oddities that they connect to the fog.\n\nEarlier today, X user @girlymisogynist posted about a patent for a \u201cprocess and apparatus for the production of intense artificial clouds, fogs, or mists.\u201d However, inventors Paul Weiss and Jules Verdier submitted the patent application on Feb. 27, 1916, and it expired in 1937. So, it\u2019s probably not related to the current fog issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nU.S. military bacteria fog experiments\n\nIn what sounds like a conspiracy theory but is reported as real by the Bay Area CBS News, the U.S. military conducted experiments over cities like San Francisco using artificial fog to spread bacteria from 1949 to 1969. They were meant to be simulations of \u201cgerm warfare\u201d attacks and allegedly sickened and even killed U.S. residents.\n\nThis is according to Director of the Terror Medicine and Security Program at Rutgers Medical School Leonard Cole in his 1989 book Clouds of Secrecy.\n\n\u201cNearly all of San Francisco received 500 particle minutes per liter,\u201d Cole wrote. \u201cIn other words, nearly every one of the 800,000 people in San Francisco exposed to the cloud at normal breathing rate (10 liters per minute) inhaled 5,000 or more particles per minute during the several hours that they remained airborne.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis report is based on \u201cgovernment records, courtroom testimony and interviews,\u201d according to Publishers Weekly.\n\nNone of this means that the government is pouring pathogens on its populace now, but we can\u2019t say it\u2019s impossible to do so.\n\nThe internet is chaotic\u2014but we\u2019ll break it down for you in one daily email.

            "article_content": "With global interest in UFOs at an all-time high, particularly in the United States where mysterious drone sightings have been driving everyone crazy, two Israeli researchers have uncovered fascinating patterns in who reports these mysterious sightings \u2014 and when.\n\nTheir study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, reveals that UFO reports might tell us less about what\u2019s in the sky and more about what\u2019s happening on the ground, particularly in our bank accounts.\n\nOhad Raveh from Hebrew University and Nathan Goldstein from Bar-Ilan University were trying to solve an interesting puzzle: How can we measure what the public is paying attention to in different places and at different times? This is important for understanding the economy, but it\u2019s difficult to measure.\n\nThey looked at years of data cataloguing recorded sightings of UFOs \u2014 or as they refer to them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena).\n\nTheir assumption was that when people report seeing something strange in the sky, they\u2019re clearly paying attention to their surroundings. The researchers thought this could be a useful way to measure public attention.\n\n\u201c We set out to understand what the association is between attention given to the sky and attention given to the economy,\u201d explains Raveh.\n\nTwo contradictory findings?\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of reports from the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States and discovered that more wealthy areas consistently report more UFO sightings than less wealthy regions.\n\nRaveh and Goldstein initially believed that this phenomenon could be explained by understanding attention as a hierarchical system: you give attention to the most pressing issues before you worry about other things.\n\n\u201cOnce you give attention to the fundamental things, then you may give attention to things that are more luxurious,\u201d Raveh elaborates. \u201cAttention to the economy is a fundamental thing, because in the end that\u2019s what brings food to your table. But once you attend to that, then you have more time on your hands to start looking at the sky.\u201d\n\nSo, because people who are more financially secure can let their minds (and eyes) wander from their budgets, they\u2019re more likely to see UAPs, right?\n\nHowever, that theory runs into some turbulence when considering the second pattern they uncovered during their research: Across the board, both poor and wealthy areas saw an increase in UFO sightings during economic downturns \u2013 a pattern that caught the researchers by surprise.\n\n\u201c We thought that the two types of attention would be substitutable. Because attention is a limited resource, and if you give attention to, say, the sky, that would be at the expense of other types of attention that you can give to other factors like the economy,\u201d says Raveh. \u201cBut apparently it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: Wealthy areas generally report more UFOs than poor areas, but when any area hits hard economic times, UFO reports increase.\n\nTurns out rich people get to spend more time looking for aliens. Photo by Jonas Von Werne via Pexels\n\nIt\u2019s all about attention\n\nThis apparent contradiction makes sense when you realize UFO reports are really measuring how much attention people are paying to their surroundings.\n\nWealthy people generally have more free time and mental space to notice unusual things in the sky. But during economic downturns, people everywhere have more time on their hands (often due to job losses or reduced work hours) and thus spot more UFOs.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by what the researchers saw during Covid lockdowns: When people were forcibly given more free time (even if they weren\u2019t necessarily experiencing economic hardship), UFO sightings increased.\n\nOverall, the research findings serve as strong evidence that UFO/UAP sightings serve as a reliable indicator of public attention patterns, which opens new possibilities for understanding how public attention influences economic outcomes.\n\nOnly one question remains, though \u2014 have the researchers seen any UFOs themselves?\n\n\u201c I wish!\u201d jokes Raveh. \u201cActually, since we started to work, I\u2019ve tried to give more attention to the skies. But I haven\u2019t seen anything, unfortunately. I hope they visit Israel sometime.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

Some 10 to 20 women also worked at the observatory, but they were the \u201ccomputers\u201d\u2014a term used for lab assistants who performed calculations. In this case, the women looked for patterns in the starlight and recorded changes to the visible stars. Payne, under a graduate fellowship, had a different role from the other women.\n\nHer mentor Harlow Shapley initially urged Payne to continue the work of a computer, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, who had realized that variations in some stars\u2019 light could be used to measure distances. But Payne wasn\u2019t interested in Leavitt\u2019s project. \u201cInstead, she wanted to focus on the decades of mostly untouched spectroscopy plates,\u201d says Burns.\n\nNo institution had more of those emulsion plates preserving star signatures than Harvard. Another computer, Annie Jump Cannon, had started to classify stars based on their signatures. Payne wanted to build on this work, combining what she learned about the inner workings of atoms at Newnham with the recent scientific theories of physics and chemistry, to understand stars.\n\nThe physics of the stars\n\nPhysics research was accelerating at the time, and the discoveries and scientific theories were traveling across the globe.\n\nResearchers had figured out the source of the patterns on spectroscopy plates\u2014electrons shifting energy levels as they zipped around an atom\u2019s nucleus, an action that emits or absorbs light. The color of that light was specific to a particular atom, meaning an electron in a carbon atom would always absorb or emit the same amount of light to reach a zippier state or drop back to a relaxed state. Within a few years, experiments determined most of energies that kick electrons to different levels for many of the atomic elements."

            "article_content": "Northwestern University engineers made a remarkable advance in quantum computing and communication, demonstrating quantum teleportation over a standard fiber optic cable that already carries everyday Internet traffic.\n\nThis development shows that quantum communication might not require dedicated lines, which clears the path for easier and more widespread integration of quantum and classical data sharing.\n\nPath for quantum networking\n\nThe news centers around the idea that quantum signals \u2014 information carried by delicate particles of light known as photons \u2014 can travel alongside everyday Internet traffic without losing their integrity.\n\n\n\nThis breakthrough demonstrates quantum teleportation, a process where the state of a particle (like a photon) is transferred to another distant particle without the initial particle moving physically.\n\nScience behind quantum teleportation\n\nBy using entangled photons, this method enables secure, near-instantaneous data sharing and paves the way for future quantum networks.\n\nThe research team successfully tested a setup that allows quantum information to weave through the bustling flow of regular Internet data without interference.\n\nThis achievement overcomes one of the biggest hurdles in making quantum networks a practical reality.\n\nPrem Kumar, who oversaw the research, is a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Northwestern\u2019s McCormick School of Engineering.\n\nHe is known for his contributions to quantum communication and serves as the director of the Center for Photonic Communication and Computing.\n\n\n\nIn their recent work, Kumar and his collaborators introduce a new way of thinking about quantum signals alongside their classical counterparts.\n\nEntanglement in quantum communication\n\nQuantum teleportation stands out because it uses entanglement as a way to exchange information without physically sending matter across a distance. The concept traces back to Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in 1935.\n\n\n\nScientists have since tested quantum entanglement in labs, culminating in the formal proposal for quantum teleportation in 1993.\n\nOne of the biggest appeals of quantum teleportation is that it can occur almost as fast as light travels. Photons can become entangled so that performing a measurement on one instantaneously affects its partner, no matter how far away it is.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is incredibly exciting because nobody thought it was possible; our work shows a path towards next-generation quantum and classical networks sharing a unified fiberoptic infrastructure. Basically, it opens the door to pushing quantum communications to the next level,\u201d enthused Kumar.\n\nProtecting delicate photons\n\nSecuring a clear route for single photons involves more than just adding them to an active cable. Ordinary Internet traffic typically relies on millions of light particles, so a handful of quantum photons can easily get lost or overwhelmed.\n\n\n\nThe Northwestern team performed detailed studies on how light scatters inside the cable to see if there was a specific wavelength that experiences less clutter.\n\nThey pinpointed that sweet spot and added special filters to reduce the noise generated by normal data traffic.\n\n\u201cQuantum teleportation has the ability to provide quantum connectivity securely between geographically distant nodes,\u201d said Kumar.\n\n\n\nPast work suggested that large-scale quantum networks might need specialized systems. Now, his findings reveal that this might not be strictly necessary, if signals are positioned in just the right place in the spectrum.\n\nFirst test run in busy channels\n\nEarlier demonstrations of quantum teleportation typically involved pristine settings or dedicated fibers.\n\nSome researchers believed that real-world cables, teeming with signals, would smother the faint quantum light. That assumption has been proven wrong.\n\nIn tests at Northwestern, the researchers ran quantum signals and classical communications over the same fiber optic cable without them colliding.\n\nThey measured how well the quantum information arrived at its destination and confirmed that it was still correct at the other end.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur work shows a path towards next-generation quantum and classical networks,\u201d Kumar summarized.\n\nReal-world infrastructure\n\nThe immediate plan is to scale the system to longer runs and then transition to underground fiber connections.\n\nThe group believes that an eventual shift to real-world cables could be next. Building on single-pair teleportation, they also want to experiment with multiple pairs of entangled photons to achieve another crucial step known as entanglement swapping.\n\nIf that milestone is reached, quantum networks could begin to take shape across regions rather than only between two points.\n\n\n\nFor critical operations in finance, defense, and data management, such networks could offer more secure connections thanks to the inherent secrecy of quantum methods, where any tampering is immediately noticeable.\n\nBroader applications\n\nThe capacity to support quantum connections without setting up special cables makes many new ideas more viable.\n\nDistributed quantum computing, which relies on linking multiple quantum computers in different locations, would be simpler to establish.\n\nDistance-sensing tasks and advanced metrology could also benefit from more stable quantum links.\n\nEven beyond computing, quantum networks have the potential to spur new technologies in encryption, imaging, and fundamental physics experiments.\n\n\n\nResearchers have also discussed using quantum entanglement to synchronize distant clocks or to share random numbers for cryptography at unprecedented levels of security.\n\nSignificance of quantum teleportation\n\nQuantum teleportation has matured from a fascinating theory to a tool that is becoming more practical.\n\nWhile it is never straightforward to integrate delicate quantum signals, the Northwestern group\u2019s accomplishment raises confidence that such integration is within reach.\n\nMany experts have believed that building specialized infrastructure was an unavoidable cost of quantum networking.\n\nAccording to Kumar\u2019s report, if wavelengths are picked carefully, classical signals and quantum information can coexist just fine. This line of thinking spares organizations from installing entire new grids of cables.\n\nFuture work on quantum teleportation\n\nIn upcoming work, the researchers plan to expand the scope of their approach in longer segments to confirm that the method remains stable as cables stretch far past the lab. They will also design a multi-node demonstration to verify it can handle more than a single link.\n\n\n\nThere is much excitement that existing communication channels, once tuned just right, could carry quantum data to distant points.\n\nWith such possibilities on the horizon, quantum teleportation may shift from a theoretical concept to a tool that transforms communication.\n\nThe future might see quantum and classical networks working side by side in ways that once sounded unlikely.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Optica.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

Duke distinguished professor of physics. \u201cWe will very much miss him.\u201d\n\nMehen, who was \u201ca highly regarded member of the faculty,\u201d first came to Duke in 2002 as an assistant professor and became a professor in 2016.\n\nHis research focused on quantum chromodynamics and the application of effective field theory to hadronic physics problems, working primarily with heavy quarks among other areas of nuclear physics. Mehen received several grants from the Department of Energy for his work and was presented with its Outstanding Junior Investigator Award in Nuclear Physics in 2005.\n\nMehen was born in Honduras and moved to Virginia with his family as a child. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Virginia and a master\u2019s degree and doctorate from Johns Hopkins University, and he was a John A. McCone Postdoctoral Scholar at the California Institute of Technology and a University Postdoctoral Fellow at The Ohio State University.\n\nHe is remembered as an \u201cindependent thinker\u201d with an \u201cextraordinary ability to grasp complex concepts effortlessly.\u201d In recent years, Mehen served as \u201cone of the driving forces\u201d behind the TMD Handbook, which sought to make theoretical physics concepts more accessible to young researchers.\n\nMehen was known for his close connection to his students, and he had been named the lead faculty member for a new introductory physics sequence launched this fall.\n\nThe physics department is planning a memorial for Mehen that will be scheduled during the spring semester.\n\nGet The Chronicle straight to your inbox Signup for our weekly newsletter.
