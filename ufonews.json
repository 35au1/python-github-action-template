There were stories that shaped our community, stories that kept your family safe, and stories that simply made us smile.\n\nHere are some of the stories on 2024 that reminded us of all the good out there.\n\nJCPS bus driver going viral after he bought PJs for 1st grader who didn't have any for Pajama Day\n\nA Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) bus driver went the extra mile for a first grader. It was Pajama Day at school but 6-year-old Levi didn't have any PJs.\n\n\"As he saw that I was upset, he saw my head looking down, and when I got on the bus he asked me what was wrong,\" Levi said. \"When I looked up tears came out of my eyes.\"\n\nLevi's bus driver later surprised him at school with some brand new pajamas.\n\nPeople as far as England and Portugal reached out to JCPS after their photo went viral.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nYared Nuguse takes bronze medal with a furious rally in historic Olympic 1500m\n\nIn August, Louisville watched one of its own race in the Olympics.\n\nManual graduate Yared Nuguse won a bronze medal in the men's 1500 meter race in Paris.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a long time since the Olympics, and I've just been taking it in for what it is, and just really believing internally that I am an Olympic bronze medalist,\" Nuguse said.\n\nThe runner got his start in high school when a teacher noticed him sprinting to McDonald's. Several years later, he sprinted across the finish line at the summer Olympics.\n\n\"Honestly, it's been pretty normal,\" he said. \"I only just finished my running season this weekend, so a lot of it has been normal training and stuff. But I'll get recognized at the grocery store a lot more, or little things like that. People are like, 'Oh my God, it's Yared.' And I'll be like, 'Oh, hi. What's up?'\"\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nLouisville's littlest lunch lady | Kind 2-year-old makes meals for trashmen every week\n\nTrash day was more than that for a 2-year-old girl in south Louisville. Little Haley and her mom makes sandwiches every Monday.\n\nThen they hand deliver them to the guys who pick up their trash. It shows just how much a little kindness can mean.\n\n\"She hears their brakes, oh it's on,\" said her mother Rosa Moran.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nClarksville residents are going crazy over mystery chicken that crosses busy road\n\nWhat the cluck is going on in Clarksville?\n\nDrivers along Brown Station Way reported a mysterious chicken hanging around the road for months.\n\n\"It's a really odd, random thing to see a chicken casually strolling through a suburban neighborhood like this,\" Clarksville resident Matt Harris said.\n\nWDRB checked it out and found the elusive bird. The town's public works office later adopted the chicken after it laid an egg in someone's pickup truck. It's not clear why the chicken crossed the road though.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nLouisville attorney surprises teen with Taylor Swift tickets\n\nA Swiftie's wildest dreams came true this fall.\n\nWDRB was there as Louisville injury lawyer Sam Aguiar surprised 14-year-old Lola with tickets to the Taylor Swift concert in Indianapolis. The family has two children with down syndrome and got emotional at the surprise.\n\n\u201cWe looked around at several deserving families, and when I saw Lola\u2019s smile and learned more about the Rosenbaum family, I was hooked,\u201d Aguiar said.\n\nLola and her mom stood in the Swift merchandise line for hours before the concert and said it was worth it.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nMechanic proves Hoosiers are not lying about UFO sightings with his flying saucer car\n\nWDRB tracked down a street-legal UFO in southern Indiana. The mechanic behind it is Steve Anderson.\n\nThe Hoosier made headlines over the summer when he kept getting pulled over on the way to the UFO Festival in Roswell, New Mexico.\n\n\"The guy pulls me over, I have these glasses on and I go, 'I come in peace.' He starts laughing,\" Anderson said.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nCopyright 2024 WDRB Media. All Rights Reserved."

            "article_content": "In today\u2019s rapidly changing technology landscape, machine learning and AI enable us to redefine industries and change how we interact with the world. AI allows developers to create more intelligent, flexible, and efficient applications. Arm, due to its unique position in the industry, has been enabling AI across a variety of platforms for more than a decade.\n\nIn this article, I want to detail how Arm\u2019s technology allows developers to focus on innovation and the unique aspects of the applications they are developing while utilizing Arm\u2019s existing technology.\n\nYou don\u2019t need an NPU for AI applications For over seven years, I\u2019ve been making content about the advantages and disadvantages of different machine learning accelerators \u2014 called NPUs. These processors have their place in devices, but one myth is that you need one to run machine learning or AI tasks. That\u2019s simply not true. AI tasks don\u2019t hinge exclusively on NPUs; they can run on anything from a CPU to a GPU. With the technology found in Arm v8 and Arm v9 chips, you can run accelerated machine learning tasks particularly well on Arm CPUs.\n\nMatrix multiplication is the key mathematical operation at the heart of machine learning and AI. GPUs and NPUs are good at matrix multiplication. However, modern Arm CPUs are also good at this processing task and have hardware accelerators that enable it, too. Whether it\u2019s Arm v8 or Arm v9, Cortex-A or Cortex-X, or Arm\u2019s Neoverse processors, they all have different technologies that allow the acceleration of matrix multiplication operations.\n\nFor example, Arm\u2019s Neon technology, and Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) are both available in Arm processors, there are also 8-bit matrix-by-matrix multiplication instructions in the Arm instruction set. In smartphones and on the edge devices, Scalable Matrix Extensions (SME) are available inside Arm processors. These technologies allow the CPU to perform accelerated matrix operations without a GPU or NPU.\n\nArm\u2019s Kleidi technology\n\nArm\n\nBeyond the hardware systems, Kleidi is a central part of Arm\u2019s strategy for enabling AI on Arm-based mobile and server platforms. It covers a range of resources and partnerships for helping developers accelerate AI seamlessly on Arm, including a library of high-performance machine learning kernels called KleidiAI, which has been optimized for Arm CPUs using those various hardware accelerators.Kleidi is available on GitLab, and these kernels have been integrated into various frameworks that are ready for developers to use. As a result, we now have hardware acceleration for Arm CPUs, supporting various machine learning technologies, from classical machine learning to current generative AI.\n\nArm has integrated Kleidi technology into popular AI frameworks such as PyTorch and ExecuTorch, resulting in significant out-of-the-box performance improvements for developers. This integration ensures that developers can seamlessly leverage Arm\u2019s optimized libraries within their existing workflows, gaining up to a 12x performance improvement with minimal effort.\n\nArm partnered with Meta to ensure the recently launched Llama 3.2 model works perfectly on Arm CPUs. The availability of smaller LLMs that enable fundamental text-based generative AI workloads, such as the one billion and three billion parameter versions, is critical for enabling AI inference at scale. Arm CPUs can run larger models, such as Llama 3.2 with 11 billion parameters and even the 90 billion parameter model in the cloud. These larger models are an excellent fit for CPU-based inference workloads in the cloud that generate text and images.\n\nThe 11 billion parameter version of Llama 3.2, running on an Amazon AWS Graviton4 processor, can achieve 29.3 tokens per second during the generation phase, and that\u2019s just on the CPU. Thanks to the collaboration between Arm and Meta on the ExecuTorch framework, you can now access optimal performance by running those models on the edge. Running the new Llama 3.2 three billion LLM on an Arm-powered smartphone through the Arm CPU optimizations leads to a 5x improvement in prompt processing and a 3x improvement in token generation, achieving 19.92 tokens per second during the generation phase.\n\nIf you want a demonstration of this, check out my video above.\n\nA massive boost for developers\n\nArm\n\nThanks to these advancements, the possibilities for developers are enormous. Think of everything you could do with a large language model running on a phone using an Arm CPU \u2014 no GPU, no NPU, no cloud, just the CPU. Arm\u2019s approach is performance portability, which means that AI developers can optimize once and then deploy their models across various platforms without making any modifications. This is particularly useful for developers who need to deploy models both on the edge, in a smartphone, and in the cloud. By using Arm, developers can be sure that their model will also perform well on other platforms once optimized for one platform.\n\nArm has some great resources for developers, including documentation on how to accelerate generative AI and ML workloads when you choose to run them on Arm CPUs, in addition to running AI and ML on Android devices."

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve has identified five species new to global science: a gecko (Hemidactylus sp.) marked by brown stripes and white nodules, the Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus), plus three plants \u2014 a globe thistle, a mignonette, and a hogbean. In addition, the Reserve recorded three species new to Saudi Arabia and extended the known global range of 34 more. These outcomes, the result of four years of fieldwork by Saudi and international experts, increase the total number of terrestrial species documented in the Reserve to 791. Although the Reserve covers only 1% of the Kingdom's terrestrial area, it is home to more than half of Saudi Arabia's terrestrial species, reinforcing its role as a vital refuge for biodiversity in a changing climate.\n\nNewly discovered gecko Hemidactylus sp, in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve\n\nAndrew Zaloumis, CEO of the Reserve, emphasized the global significance of these findings, stating: \"At a moment in time when the IUCN has warned that 28% of species globally are now at risk of extinction these discoveries are significant. They reaffirm the importance of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve as a bioclimatic refugia, particularly as climate change is increasingly impacting the customary habitats of many of these species. Testament to this is the Reserve's iconic Wadi Al-Disah, with its 200+ species, a key site on the UNESCO World Heritage Bioclimatic Refugia of Western Arabia tentative list. None of this would have been possible without the strong collaboration of natural scientists from the Kingdom and 14 other countries with the Reserve over the last 4 years to conduct multi-season field surveys.\"\n\nAmong the five species new to science are two reptiles and three plants, each with unique ecological and cultural significance. The gecko (Hemidactylus sp.), currently undergoing DNA analysis, features striking brown horizontal stripes from neck to tail and white nodules along its back. This gecko preys on small invertebrates like mosquitoes, playing an essential role in pest control within desert ecosystems. The Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus) is a small, non-venomous species that is bright red with a distinctive black collar.\n\nThe three new plants to science are firstly the globe thistle (Echinops sp. aff. glaberrimus) from the Asteraceae family. It produces vibrant blooms that support pollinators and promote ecosystem health. Historically, it has been used medicinally to treat infections and inflammations. Secondly the mignonette, (Reseda sp. aff. muricata), known for its herbal properties, is often used in teas and perfumery. And thirdly, in contrast, the hogbean (Hyoscyamus sp.) from the Nightshade family has a more complex history, having been used both as a poison and in early anesthesiology and palliative care.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Scientists have announced the discovery of a species of lipstick vine that is completely new to science, found in the depths of the Philippine rainforest.\n\nThis species, which has never been documented in botanical records, has sparked a wave of excitement among scientists and nature enthusiasts alike.\n\nAn expedition into the heart of Luzon\n\nA daring expedition by a team of botanists in 2022 led them into Barangay Balbalasang rainforest, a remote and virtually inaccessible part of Luzon island.\n\nThe journey began with days of rugged travel to reach the rainforest, which was filled with unforgiving thickets that demanded to be sliced with machetes. In these wild conditions, the researchers discovered their prize.\n\nThe team included Jayson Mansibang, Adriane Tobias, and Pastor L. Malabrigo from the University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os, along with Dr. Chris Thorogood, Deputy Director and Head of Science at the Oxford Botanic Garden and Arboretum.\n\nThe researchers stayed with the Banao Tribe, an indigenous community that protects the local forest.\n\nA lipstick vine unlike any other\n\nAmong the species found in the forest, one stood out \u2013 a specimen of the lipstick vine, a genus known as Aeschynanthus.\n\nThis plant had a distinct pattern of delicate purple mottling which painted its flowers in a pattern similar to that of a European foxglove.\n\n\u201cWe were trekking through dense vegetation when suddenly we spotted a luminous white, purple-spotted flower dangling above our heads,\u201d said Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cWe suspected immediately that it was new to science. It\u2019s so exciting that beautiful species like this are still there waiting to be described.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of a new lipstick vine\n\nThe team named the plant Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus from the Latin \u2018penta,\u2019 meaning five, and \u2018trichomatus\u2019 referring to the trichomes \u2013 hair-like outgrowths deep in the throats of the flowers.\n\nLipstick vines, encompassing nearly 180 tropical and subtropical species, are known for their tubular, bud-like appearance.\n\nThese vines, often adorning other plants and trees, boast vibrantly colored flowers that attract birds for pollination.\n\nConservation concerns amid climate change\n\nSadly, this newfound beauty already faces a critical risk of extinction. Rapid climate change, driving increasingly intense typhoons, relentlessly threatens the plant\u2019s natural habitat.\n\nThe Barangay Balbalasang rainforest remains remarkably intact, housing numerous species that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The researchers hope that the new discovery can help support conservation efforts to protect the region.\n\n\u201cWe dedicate this discovery not only to the unique beauty of the Banao forest but also to the Banao People themselves, who, through their care and stewardship, have ensured the conservation of rare species within these precious forests,\u201d said Tobias.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to find Aeschynanthus in such an environment, and as young botanists, we were thrilled to discover something so distinct.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s plant data darkspots\n\n\u201cMany new species remain undocumented in the world\u2019s \u2018plant data darkspots\u2019 \u2013 up to 15% of the world\u2019s flora in fact,\u201d noted Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cFinding these \u2018known unknowns\u2019 is essential for understanding and protecting biodiversity. That\u2019s what makes discoveries such as this one so important for conservation science.\u201d\n\nEcological importance of lipstick vines\n\nThe discovery of Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus sheds light on the ecological importance of lipstick vines in tropical ecosystems.\n\nAs epiphytes, these plants grow on trees without harming them, creating microhabitats that support diverse wildlife.\n\nTheir vividly colored flowers play a vital role in attracting pollinators, particularly birds, which are essential for maintaining the delicate balance of tropical rainforests.\n\nBeyond their ecological contributions, lipstick vines are indicators of environmental health. Their presence often signifies a well-preserved ecosystem, as these plants thrive only in stable and intact habitats.\n\nProtecting a unique rainforest\n\nThe discovery of this new species in Barangay Balbalasang emphasizes the rainforest\u2019s unique biodiversity and the urgent need to safeguard it.\n\nWith nearly 180 known species of Aeschynanthus, each adapted to its specific environment, the newly discovered species offers valuable insights into the evolution of plant-pollinator relationships and the resilience of tropical flora in the face of climate change.\n\nProtecting Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus is not just about preserving a single species; it is about safeguarding the intricate web of life that it supports.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Nordic Journal of Botany.\n\nImage Credit: Chris Thorogood\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

(Image: Johanna Weston/WHOI)\n\nThe ocean\u2019s deepest regions still hold many secrets. Despite covering 71% of Earth, over 95% of our oceans remain unexplored. The deep-sea ecosystem is home to bizarre life forms thriving under extreme conditions. A recent discovery has revealed a new species, expanding our understanding of these mysterious depths.\n\nIn the Atacama Trench, located off South America's coast, researchers found a new species of amphipod. Named Dulcibella camanchaca, this pale, ghostly creature was discovered at a depth of 7,902 meters. The species is remarkable for its predatory behaviour, marking a first in the deep-sea food web.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nDulcibella camanchaca: A New Addition to the Deep-Sea Ecosystem\n\nUnlike typical amphipods, which scavenge on organic matter, D. camanchaca actively hunts prey. This predatory nature makes it the first documented amphipod from the hadal zone\u2014depths below 6,000 meters. Researchers believe these deep-sea species can provide vital insights into ecosystems on other planets, such as Europa and Enceladus.\n\nRead Also: Scientists discover new pale blue damselfish species in Maldives' deep-sea reefs\n\nThe species name camanchaca, meaning \u201cdarkness\u201d in local languages, reflects its environment. These creatures survive in extreme conditions, including frigid temperatures, high pressure, and complete darkness. The D. camanchaca measures under 4 cm, with specialised appendages to capture prey.\n\nThe species name camanchaca, meaning \u201cdarkness\u201d in local languages, reflects its environment. (Johanna Weston/WHOI)\n\nA Step Forward in Deep-Sea Exploration\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nThe discovery was made during a 2023 expedition led by Chile\u2019s Integrated Deep-Ocean Observing System. Researchers used a lander vehicle equipped with baited traps to retrieve the specimens. This marks a significant milestone in exploring the Atacama Trench, a region rich in biodiversity.\n\nThe Atacama Trench is known for its isolation and high levels of sediment. This creates a unique environment where specialised species like Dulcibella camanchaca can evolve. Over the years, the trench has revealed a range of endemic species, including amphipods, snailfish, and mud dragons.\n\nRead Also: Male humpback whale crosses 8,000 miles across 3 oceans for sex; sets new distance record\n\nImportance of Protecting Our Ocean Ecosystems\n\nThe discovery of D. camanchaca adds to the growing list of endemic species in the trench. Scientists have confirmed it belongs to a new genus within the Eusiridae family. As a predatory species, D. camanchaca plays a crucial role in its deep-sea food web, hunting smaller organisms to maintain ecosystem balance.\n\nThis discovery underscores the importance of continued deep-sea exploration. It also highlights the need to protect these fragile ecosystems from threats like climate change and human activities. The ocean\u2019s depths still hold much to teach us, with each new species unveiling more of the planet\u2019s hidden wonders."

            "article_content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nAfter months of waiting, it finally happened \u2014 OpenAI launched its video generator, Sora. Or, at least, it opened up access to the tool, only for the entire internet to jump on board simultaneously, forcing OpenAI to pump the brakes on account creation. Thanks to a little bit of patience and determination, I\u2019ve made my way through the waitlist, and now I have the power to generate just about anything I can think up \u2014 within some well-defined limits.\n\nWith that great power and responsibility has come something else, though: a great learning curve. Even though I\u2019m enjoying Sora and am impressed by its capabilities, I\u2019m having trouble nailing down the perfect prompts to get videos I\u2019m pleased with. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a matter of practice, but here\u2019s how my first few days with Sora have gone.\n\nHave you used OpenAI's Sora to generate videos yet? 7 votes Yes 29 % No 71 %\n\nVideo creation at your fingertips?\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about how Sora works \u2014 or at least how to access the powerful video generation tool. Although it comes from OpenAI, and you need to be a ChatGPT Plus or Pro member to start creating, you can\u2019t get to Sora through the main ChatGPT interface. Instead, you have to head directly to the Sora website (sora.com), where you\u2019re met with a gallery of Featured clips that set the bar incredibly high.\n\nAt least, they set the bar high in my own head. I scrolled through a few of them, looked at their prompts, watched them run smoothly, and figured I could do the same. After all, my prompts would be run through the same adaptation of DALL-E 3 that theirs had been, so they should look just as good, right? It\u2019s not quite that easy. Sure, typing in prompts is quite easy, but figuring out what Sora responds best to is a bit harder.\n\nCreating videos is as easy as typing out what you want to see... or at least it seems that way on paper.\n\nBefore we get to the challenges, though, I should probably clarify some of Sora\u2019s current limitations. Unlike Google\u2019s Pixel Studio or another basic image generator, you can\u2019t simply sit and run Sora to your heart\u2019s content \u2014 at least not as a ChatGPT Plus member for $20 per month.\n\nInstead, you\u2019re given a bank of 1,000 credits, which you can spend on video generation as you see fit. Everything you change within your prompt, from the aspect ratio to the duration to the resolution, will cost a certain number of those credits until you run out for the month. Brand new videos cost anywhere from 20 credits to 2,000 credits, and you can check out a helpful table of costs here \u2014 something I wish I\u2019d found before I spent 260 credits in about 20 minutes. You\u2019re also limited to one video generation at a time and a maximum resolution of 720p as a Plus member.\n\nIf you spring for a ChatGPT Pro membership, the limits are much looser but the price is much, much higher at $200 per month. Instead of 1,000 credits, you get 10,000 credits for priority videos, after which you get unlimited video generations; they just take a bit longer \u2014 OpenAI calls them \u201crelaxed videos.\u201d Pro members can also generate five videos at a time, bump them up to 1080p, and let them run as long as 20 seconds.\n\nUnfortunately, though, no matter what tier of ChatGPT you pay for, none of Sora\u2019s videos have audio to them, so you\u2019ll have to download your clips and sync music or sound effects after you\u2019ve nailed down the visuals. OpenAI has suggested that support for audio will reach Sora eventually, it\u2019s just not there yet.\n\nHow hard could it be?\n\nWith that basic introduction out of the way, the rest of using Sora to generate videos should be easy, right? Well, yes and no. Although typing in your prompt, choosing your settings from the menu at the bottom, and waiting for your video to generate is that easy, it\u2019s much harder to come up with something worthy of Sora\u2019s ever-changing Featured feed.\n\nIn an attempt to share my limited cache of tokens for the month, as soon as I got access to Sora, I reached out to my colleague Mitja. He and I had been discussing how quickly we might get access to the platform, so I figured he might have some good ideas for generations right off the bat. As it turned out, his first thought was something I never could have imagined: Ten zebras in suits dancing to a Michael Jackson song in front of the Sydney Opera House while eating pesto ravioli. It may seem like a weird video to make, but if Sora can handle that amount of detail, then it\u2019s definitely the real deal.\n\nSora will take a stab at almost anything you ask for, but you have to describe it just right.\n\nOnce I finished laughing at the idea, I ran it through Sora and waited for the result. Technically, the final product got most things right. It put a group of zebras in suits in front of the Sydney Opera House, and they all had green plates in their hands. However, the number fluctuated between eight and about 12 zebras, there was no indication that it was a Michael Jackson song, and the pesto ravioli was definitely just a green plate \u2014 close, but not quite right. More worryingly, I had bumped the cost of the video up to 100 tokens because I hoped a ten-second clip would show more dancing. It had not.\n\nI\u2019ve since learned, however, that Sora\u2019s Storyboard tool is a must-have for pretty much anything involving complex motion. It allows you to drag and drop clips along your five- or ten-second timeline, helping Sora break up the action and flow from one direction to another. So, in an attempt to draw a little bit more action out of my zebra friends, I jumped into the storyboard and split the dancing and the pesto ravioli into two separate actions spaced out over the five-second clip, then I used ChatGPT to punch up my description \u2014 yet another built-in feature of the Storyboard.\n\nOnce again\u2026 It kind of worked, but it kind of didn\u2019t. Yes, I got the zebras, and they were in front of the Sydney Opera House, but they had given up on dancing, and when asked to eat some of their ravioli, they suddenly grew human hands to hold their forks. Sorry, Featured feed, but I think I\u2019m a long way off.\n\nI\u2019ve also tried more natural prompts, like macaroni penguins sliding down icebergs into the sea, and more fantastical prompts, like a piece of toast with a Pixar-like face leaping out of a toaster, and the story has mostly been the same. Sora handles some pieces of each prompt incredibly well, but you have to describe your scene with just the right amount of detail. Too much, and Sora begins to merge different elements. Too little, and you get a relatively boring finished product.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, there\u2019s even more to Sora than I\u2019ve touched, especially when it comes to editing. The video generator also packs the ability to re-cut, remix, and blend clips to expand on an idea, join one video to another, or clip out elements that don\u2019t work well. But again, I\u2019d still like to nail down a video that looks good the first time.\n\nChallenges aside, I\u2019m excited for the future\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nOverall, it\u2019s fair to call my first few days using Sora a mixed bag. Has the video generator been perfect? No, but I can\u2019t entirely blame OpenAI for that. This is my first shot at generating videos based purely on text, so I\u2019m not surprised that I\u2019ve struggled to nail down the right level of detail. So far, I\u2019ve given Sora too much information, and I\u2019ve given it too little, which means that nailing just the right prompt has to be around the corner.\n\nMore importantly, though, I\u2019ve been thoroughly impressed by what Sora promises to do. The videos I can create as a ChatGPT Plus member take mere moments to conjure, and I imagine they\u2019ll get faster as the model continues its training. I\u2019m not entirely sure that I\u2019d use any of the speedy clips that Sora has cooked up just yet \u2014 many of them still suffer from weird artifacts like the human arms appearing on my zebras \u2014 but the clips that do make it to Sora\u2019s Featured collection give me hope that it\u2019s just a matter of learning how to ask for the right elements.\n\nI'm impressed by Sora, but I have a lot of learning to do.\n\nAlong with that, I won\u2019t be surprised if the way OpenAI handles prompts and creations opens up, too. Right now, when you burn through your 1,000 credits as a ChatGPT Plus member, that\u2019s it \u2014 there\u2019s no way to buy a few more until your billing period rolls over. Likewise, there\u2019s no way to roll unused credits from one month to the next, so you have to find the right balance of spending and saving to make it through the month.\n\nIf it were up to me, I\u2019d sure like to reclaim a few of the sillier credits I\u2019ve spent, but that\u2019s not an option. Instead, I\u2019ll call it the cost of learning, and I\u2019ll just have to take a little bit more time to fine-tune my prompts before I send them off to Sora. Maybe one day, I\u2019ll come up with something worth featuring.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

            "article_content": "5 Trends In Digital Therapeutics For 2025\n\nBy Acacia Parks, Ph.D., MBA, CEO, Liquid Amber\n\nDespite industry pitfalls we\u2019ve seen in the past, digital therapeutics (DTx) are poised to gain momentum by showcasing their viability in addressing unmet healthcare needs, improving patient outcomes, and complementing traditional treatments over the next year.\n\nExpansion In Mental Health And Other Therapeutic Areas\n\nDTx has traditionally been rooted in areas like mental health and chronic disease management, and we\u2019ll continue to see developers drive innovation in these areas \u2014 bringing new digital therapies to market and refining existing technologies, especially in new indications where there are no or limited existing digital health interventions.\n\nFor example, Pfizer recently released a new digital application for migraine management that helps patients better understand and manage their symptoms through personalized insights and education. Given the prevalence and global burden of migraines, it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll see more manufacturers homing in on this condition as well.\n\nThe digital health sector also will expand to new therapeutic domains, including:\n\nOncology: Used to complement patients\u2019 existing oncology care, DTx products are emerging as a valuable tool in addressing side effects such as pain, nausea, and fatigue, as well as anxiety and depression associated with cancer diagnoses.\n\nUsed to complement patients\u2019 existing oncology care, DTx products are emerging as a valuable tool in addressing side effects such as pain, nausea, and fatigue, as well as anxiety and depression associated with cancer diagnoses. Women\u2019s health: With helpful features such as symptom tracking, behavioral coaching, telehealth, and more, the women\u2019s health sector will continue to see rapid adoption of digital therapeutics.\n\nWith helpful features such as symptom tracking, behavioral coaching, telehealth, and more, the women\u2019s health sector will continue to see rapid adoption of digital therapeutics. Pediatric conditions: We\u2019ve seen DTx interventions transform pediatric care by tackling ADHD, autism, and anxiety with engaging, interactive designs to address their symptoms.\n\nEvolving Approaches To FDA Interactions\n\nAs the industry continues to mature, DTx companies need to continue engaging with the FDA early and often as they develop their products. This includes meeting with the Agency to gauge their thoughts on endpoints, study designs, and statistical approaches before conducting a trial, as well as at key milestones throughout development, such as the conclusion of a study.\n\nLack of robust clinical evidence, issues with data privacy, and regulatory missteps encompass the challenges developers face in obtaining FDA approval for their digital therapies. Many companies approach the FDA expecting to be guided on how to conduct their research or obtain clearance, which can delay the start of trials or market approval, especially if studies have already been conducted without a clear understanding of what\u2019s needed for clinical validation. I\u2019m hopeful that these companies will learn from their and others\u2019 mistakes going into the next year.\n\nThe Future Of DTx And Healthcare Provider Partnerships\n\nSeamless integration of DTx into clinical workflows will require stronger partnerships between DTx companies and healthcare providers. In 2025, these collaborations will be driven by co-design initiatives where providers play a central role in shaping the design and deployment of digital therapies. This will ensure that DTx tools address real-world challenges, such as fitting within the constraints of short appointment times or interfacing with existing electronic health records (EHRs).\n\nAdditionally, we\u2019ll see a rise in clinical decision support (CDS) tools that integrate with DTx platforms, equipping providers with actionable insights to guide patient care. The success of these partnerships will hinge on DTx companies\u2019 ability to demonstrate the simplicity, scalability, and tangible value of their solutions within the realities of modern clinical practice.\n\nPredictions For Reimbursement Models\n\nReimbursement remains one of the greatest challenges for the DTx industry. However, in July of this year, the CMS introduced a potential new reimbursement pathway for \"digital mental health treatment\" (DMHT) devices and services in its 2025 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Proposed Rule. This marks a monumental milestone for the DTx industry, where insurance companies have yet to offer reimbursement.\n\nThe introduction of three new codes anticipated for 2025 could pave the way for Medicare reimbursement frameworks for the treatment of chronic diseases and other therapeutic areas. This development has the potential to enhance the credibility of digital therapeutics by highlighting their ability to deliver measurable health outcomes. Ideally, it could also encourage the private insurance sector to adopt similar approaches.\n\nThe three proposed codes will reimburse physicians for:\n\nGMBT1: Prescribing FDA-approved DTx devices for mental health\n\nPrescribing FDA-approved DTx devices for mental health GMBT2: The first 20 minutes of managing a patient\u2019s DTx device each month\n\nThe first 20 minutes of managing a patient\u2019s DTx device each month GMBT3: Each additional 20 minutes of management\n\nAI-Driven Innovation\n\nAI and ML will continue to redefine DTx development and delivery in 2025, accelerating innovation and transforming patient outcomes. AI-powered algorithms will enable hyper-personalized interventions in real time, adapting content and strategies based on user data. These advancements will enhance engagement and treatment efficacy, ensuring that patients receive the most effective therapy for their unique needs. At the same time, strong evidence-generation programs will help to differentiate science-backed products from the thousands of digital health products out there that are not based in, or tested by, science.\n\nOn the operational side, we\u2019ll see more sponsors and CROs integrating AI within their everyday workflows. Companies will continue to leverage AI to streamline clinical trial design by identifying ideal patient populations and optimizing study endpoints through predictive analytics, reducing time and costs. AI also has untapped potential to improve diversity in trial populations with natural language processing (NLP) tools to provide translation services, remote monitoring to allow virtual participation, and data-driven site selection to identify sites with specific demographic populations. This sets the stage for developers to demonstrate value to payers by forecasting long-term outcomes and cost savings with greater precision.\n\nA Call To Action For DTx Innovators\n\nTo thrive in 2025, DTx companies must prioritize collaboration with regulators, healthcare providers, and payers. Proactive engagement, combined with a relentless focus on evidence generation and user-centric design, will enable the industry to realize its full potential. By building trust and demonstrating value across stakeholders, DTx has the opportunity to not only transform individual patient care but also redefine how we deliver healthcare on a global scale. The steps we take today will determine how quickly and effectively these innovations can make a lasting impact on patients' lives.\n\nAbout The Author:\n\nAcacia Parks, Ph.D., MBA, who serves as an advisor to Lindus Health, is a digital health executive whose experience revolves around scientific, product, and regulatory strategy for digital therapeutics/software as medical device (SAMD).

            "article_content": "The Hubble tension is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology.\n\nIt centers around the Hubble constant\u2014the measurement of how fast our universe is expanding\u2014which comes out as two different numbers when calculated two different ways, even though those numbers should always match.\n\nNow, the James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that this tension is real, rather than a miscalculation or a problem with our equipment. That means there\u2019s something in the underlying physics of our universe that remains a mystery.\n\nThe Hubble tension is one of the most hotly debated discrepancies in all of astronomy. It centers around a number called the Hubble constant, which is functionally the rate at which our universe is expanding. Yup, our infinite universe is expanding. Trippy.\n\nWe\u2019ve known that this expansion is a fact of our cosmos for a while now (we also know that expansion is speeding up, but that\u2019s another story). But we still don\u2019t know exactly how fast this expansion is happening\u2014we don\u2019t know what the Hubble constant is. And it\u2019s not for lack of trying, either.\n\nThere\u2019s a few ways you can measure the Hubble Constant, but there are two major ones. The first, which is how the Hubble Telescope itself does it, is to figure out how fast the things around us are moving away from us. This is done by targeting specific, reliable objects in the sky, calculating the distances to them, and combining those distance with measurements of redshift (a phenomenon that happens when an object moves away from our vantage point, stretching out the light its sending our way and making it appear redder). This is called a local measurement, and it results in a Hubble constant of around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc).\n\nThe second way is to look at the Big Bang. Well, not directly\u2014that\u2019s currently impossible. But we can look at the cosmic microwave background, which is the radiation from the Big Bang that permeates every \u2018corner\u2019 of our universe. By studying this ancient radiation, we can get a reading of what the Hubble constant would have been back when the universe began, and then use our knowledge of the laws of physics to functionally fast-forward and find what that Hubble constant should be now. Using this method, we get a predicted Hubble constant of around 68 km/s/Mpc.\n\nAnd that is the Hubble tension\u2014those numbers should be the same, but they\u2019re not. And when expectation doesn\u2019t match observation in astronomy, it means one of two things: there\u2019s something wrong with our measurement techniques, or there\u2019s something wrong with our understanding of physics.\n\nNow, more and more, it\u2019s looking like the latter. A recent paper\u2014led by Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for his discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating and, by extension, his discovery of dark energy\u2014announced that observations from the James Webb Space Telescope further confirm Hubble\u2019s measurements of the local Hubble constant. According to our absolute best space telescope, the Hubble constant is around 73 km/s/Mpc (which is within the margin of error of the original Hubble measurement), not the ~68 km/s/Mpc it should be.\n\nIt might be fair to have a little bit of a \u201cso what?\u201d reaction to this news. After all, when you boil it down, the only thing we\u2019ve discovered is that there is in fact something we still don\u2019t understand about the expansion of the universe.\n\nBut the excitement behind this announcement comes from the fact that this new measurement confirms that the Hubble tension is real. It\u2019s not a quirk of an old telescope\u2014it\u2019s actually a problem. And that means this isn\u2019t some trivial squabble. There\u2019s something we don\u2019t know about the basic physics that underpin our entire cosmos.\n\nScientists are going to keep pushing to understand exactly what we\u2019re missing that is leading to this discrepancy. And if our scientific history is anything to go by, someday, they\u2019ll figure it out. And when they do, we\u2019re going to have entirely new physics on our hands. How exciting.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve has identified five species new to global science: a gecko (Hemidactylus sp.) marked by brown stripes and white nodules, the Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus), plus three plants \u2014 a globe thistle, a mignonette, and a hogbean. In addition, the Reserve recorded three species new to Saudi Arabia and extended the known global range of 34 more. These outcomes, the result of four years of fieldwork by Saudi and international experts, increase the total number of terrestrial species documented in the Reserve to 791. Although the Reserve covers only 1% of the Kingdom's terrestrial area, it is home to more than half of Saudi Arabia's terrestrial species, reinforcing its role as a vital refuge for biodiversity in a changing climate.\n\nNewly discovered gecko Hemidactylus sp, in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve\n\nAndrew Zaloumis, CEO of the Reserve, emphasized the global significance of these findings, stating: \"At a moment in time when the IUCN has warned that 28% of species globally are now at risk of extinction these discoveries are significant. They reaffirm the importance of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve as a bioclimatic refugia, particularly as climate change is increasingly impacting the customary habitats of many of these species. Testament to this is the Reserve's iconic Wadi Al-Disah, with its 200+ species, a key site on the UNESCO World Heritage Bioclimatic Refugia of Western Arabia tentative list. None of this would have been possible without the strong collaboration of natural scientists from the Kingdom and 14 other countries with the Reserve over the last 4 years to conduct multi-season field surveys.\"\n\nAmong the five species new to science are two reptiles and three plants, each with unique ecological and cultural significance. The gecko (Hemidactylus sp.), currently undergoing DNA analysis, features striking brown horizontal stripes from neck to tail and white nodules along its back. This gecko preys on small invertebrates like mosquitoes, playing an essential role in pest control within desert ecosystems. The Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus) is a small, non-venomous species that is bright red with a distinctive black collar.\n\nThe three new plants to science are firstly the globe thistle (Echinops sp. aff. glaberrimus) from the Asteraceae family. It produces vibrant blooms that support pollinators and promote ecosystem health. Historically, it has been used medicinally to treat infections and inflammations. Secondly the mignonette, (Reseda sp. aff. muricata), known for its herbal properties, is often used in teas and perfumery. And thirdly, in contrast, the hogbean (Hyoscyamus sp.) from the Nightshade family has a more complex history, having been used both as a poison and in early anesthesiology and palliative care.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Scientists have announced the discovery of a species of lipstick vine that is completely new to science, found in the depths of the Philippine rainforest.\n\nThis species, which has never been documented in botanical records, has sparked a wave of excitement among scientists and nature enthusiasts alike.\n\nAn expedition into the heart of Luzon\n\nA daring expedition by a team of botanists in 2022 led them into Barangay Balbalasang rainforest, a remote and virtually inaccessible part of Luzon island.\n\nThe journey began with days of rugged travel to reach the rainforest, which was filled with unforgiving thickets that demanded to be sliced with machetes. In these wild conditions, the researchers discovered their prize.\n\nThe team included Jayson Mansibang, Adriane Tobias, and Pastor L. Malabrigo from the University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os, along with Dr. Chris Thorogood, Deputy Director and Head of Science at the Oxford Botanic Garden and Arboretum.\n\nThe researchers stayed with the Banao Tribe, an indigenous community that protects the local forest.\n\nA lipstick vine unlike any other\n\nAmong the species found in the forest, one stood out \u2013 a specimen of the lipstick vine, a genus known as Aeschynanthus.\n\nThis plant had a distinct pattern of delicate purple mottling which painted its flowers in a pattern similar to that of a European foxglove.\n\n\u201cWe were trekking through dense vegetation when suddenly we spotted a luminous white, purple-spotted flower dangling above our heads,\u201d said Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cWe suspected immediately that it was new to science. It\u2019s so exciting that beautiful species like this are still there waiting to be described.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of a new lipstick vine\n\nThe team named the plant Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus from the Latin \u2018penta,\u2019 meaning five, and \u2018trichomatus\u2019 referring to the trichomes \u2013 hair-like outgrowths deep in the throats of the flowers.\n\nLipstick vines, encompassing nearly 180 tropical and subtropical species, are known for their tubular, bud-like appearance.\n\nThese vines, often adorning other plants and trees, boast vibrantly colored flowers that attract birds for pollination.\n\nConservation concerns amid climate change\n\nSadly, this newfound beauty already faces a critical risk of extinction. Rapid climate change, driving increasingly intense typhoons, relentlessly threatens the plant\u2019s natural habitat.\n\nThe Barangay Balbalasang rainforest remains remarkably intact, housing numerous species that cannot be found anywhere else in the world. The researchers hope that the new discovery can help support conservation efforts to protect the region.\n\n\u201cWe dedicate this discovery not only to the unique beauty of the Banao forest but also to the Banao People themselves, who, through their care and stewardship, have ensured the conservation of rare species within these precious forests,\u201d said Tobias.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to find Aeschynanthus in such an environment, and as young botanists, we were thrilled to discover something so distinct.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s plant data darkspots\n\n\u201cMany new species remain undocumented in the world\u2019s \u2018plant data darkspots\u2019 \u2013 up to 15% of the world\u2019s flora in fact,\u201d noted Dr. Thorogood.\n\n\u201cFinding these \u2018known unknowns\u2019 is essential for understanding and protecting biodiversity. That\u2019s what makes discoveries such as this one so important for conservation science.\u201d\n\nEcological importance of lipstick vines\n\nThe discovery of Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus sheds light on the ecological importance of lipstick vines in tropical ecosystems.\n\nAs epiphytes, these plants grow on trees without harming them, creating microhabitats that support diverse wildlife.\n\nTheir vividly colored flowers play a vital role in attracting pollinators, particularly birds, which are essential for maintaining the delicate balance of tropical rainforests.\n\nBeyond their ecological contributions, lipstick vines are indicators of environmental health. Their presence often signifies a well-preserved ecosystem, as these plants thrive only in stable and intact habitats.\n\nProtecting a unique rainforest\n\nThe discovery of this new species in Barangay Balbalasang emphasizes the rainforest\u2019s unique biodiversity and the urgent need to safeguard it.\n\nWith nearly 180 known species of Aeschynanthus, each adapted to its specific environment, the newly discovered species offers valuable insights into the evolution of plant-pollinator relationships and the resilience of tropical flora in the face of climate change.\n\nProtecting Aeschynanthus pentatrichomatus is not just about preserving a single species; it is about safeguarding the intricate web of life that it supports.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Nordic Journal of Botany.\n\nImage Credit: Chris Thorogood\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Elon Musk and Sam Altman, once collaborators in the creation of OpenAI, now find themselves at the forefront of a growing rivalry that is transforming the artificial intelligence (AI) landscape. Their public disagreements highlight critical issues, including the balance between transparency and competition, the ethical challenges of AI development, and the tension between profit-driven goals and altruistic intentions. This rivalry, marked by accusations, strategic moves, and legal disputes, underscores the broader challenges the AI industry faces as it navigates rapid advancements and societal expectations.\n\nWhat began as a shared vision for advancing AI has evolved into a public and deeply personal competition between Musk and Altman. Their conflict encapsulates a larger conversation about transparency, ethics, and the delicate balance between innovation and responsibility in a fast-moving industry. This story sheds light on how ideals often clash with the profit-driven realities of the modern tech world.\n\nElon Musk vs Sam Altman\n\nMore than just a tale of competing personalities, this rivalry reflects the growing pains of an industry shaping the future of humanity. As Musk and Altman take bold steps to outpace one another, they force critical questions into the spotlight: Can AI development remain true to its original altruistic principles? And what happens when the drive for dominance in AI overshadows collaboration? While the answers remain complex, the implications of this competition could not be more significant.\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Elon Musk and Sam Altman, once collaborators at OpenAI, are now rivals, highlighting critical issues in AI development such as transparency, ethics, and the balance between profit and altruism.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s shift from a nonprofit to a for-profit model, along with its partnership with Microsoft, has sparked controversy and accusations of betraying its founding mission.\n\nThe Musk-Altman feud underscores tensions in AI leadership, with Musk criticizing Altman for deviating from OpenAI\u2019s original goals, while Altman defends the shift as necessary for competitiveness.\n\nMusk has launched legal challenges against OpenAI and started his own AI venture, xAI, intensifying competition and driving rapid innovation in the AI sector.\n\nThe rivalry raises broader questions about the ethical and regulatory frameworks needed to guide AI development, with implications for the future of technology and society.\n\nTheir conflict is not merely personal but emblematic of the larger debates surrounding AI\u2019s future. As two of the most influential figures in technology, Musk and Altman\u2019s actions and decisions are shaping the trajectory of AI innovation, raising questions about how to ensure that these powerful technologies benefit humanity as a whole.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s Controversial Shift\n\nOpenAI was founded with a bold mission: to ensure that artificial intelligence serves the greater good of humanity. Initially structured as a nonprofit organization, it embraced open source principles to counterbalance the dominance of major tech corporations like Google. However, OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit model has sparked significant controversy, with critics arguing that this shift undermines its founding ideals.\n\nElon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has been one of the most vocal critics of this transformation. He has accused the organization of abandoning its commitment to transparency and prioritizing financial gain over ethical considerations. OpenAI\u2019s close partnership with Microsoft, which has invested billions into the organization, has further fueled these concerns. Critics argue that this relationship compromises OpenAI\u2019s independence and raises questions about whether its decisions are driven by profit motives rather than its original mission.\n\nThe shift has become a focal point in the broader debate over the role of ethics in AI development. It highlights the challenges organizations face in balancing the need for resources with the imperative to maintain public trust and uphold their stated values.\n\nClash of Leadership: Musk vs Altman\n\nThe personal and professional rift between Elon Musk and Sam Altman has become a defining narrative in the AI industry. Musk has publicly criticized Altman, accusing him of steering OpenAI away from its original mission and prioritizing personal and organizational gain. Altman, in response, has defended his leadership, asserting that OpenAI\u2019s transition was necessary to secure the resources required to remain competitive in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.\n\nThis feud has played out in public forums, with Musk making pointed remarks about Altman\u2019s leadership style and even comparing him to a manipulative character from *Game of Thrones*. Altman, for his part, has emphasized the challenges of leading an organization in an industry where innovation moves at breakneck speed and decisions have far-reaching implications.\n\nThe conflict between Musk and Altman underscores a broader tension in the AI sector: how to balance the drive for rapid technological progress with the need for ethical responsibility. It also highlights the complexities of leadership in an industry where the stakes are extraordinarily high, both in terms of societal impact and competitive pressures.\n\nElon Musks NEW Plans To Crush Sam Altman And OpenAI\n\nBrowse through more resources below from our in-depth content covering more areas on OpenAI :\n\nLegal Battles and Competitive Moves\n\nElon Musk has not limited his opposition to public criticism. He has taken legal action to challenge OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit model, alleging that the organization has engaged in anti-competitive practices. Musk has also accused OpenAI of granting Microsoft unfair access to sensitive information, which he claims gives the company a significant competitive advantage.\n\nAt the same time, Musk has launched his own AI initiative, xAI, which directly competes with OpenAI. By securing substantial resources, including a large supply of Nvidia GPUs, Musk aims to develop advanced AI technologies that could rival or surpass OpenAI\u2019s capabilities. This move has intensified competition within the AI sector, pushing both organizations to innovate at an accelerated pace.\n\nThe rivalry between Musk and Altman has significant implications for the industry. It is driving advancements in AI technology but also raising concerns about the potential consequences of unchecked competition. As both leaders pursue their visions, the industry must grapple with questions about fairness, transparency, and the broader societal impact of their innovations.\n\nAltman\u2019s Defense and Ongoing Challenges\n\nSam Altman has remained steadfast in defending OpenAI\u2019s evolution, arguing that the shift to a for-profit model was essential to secure the funding and resources needed to achieve its ambitious goals. He has emphasized that the organization remains committed to its mission of making sure that AI benefits humanity, even as it navigates the complexities of a competitive market.\n\nHowever, Altman faces significant challenges. OpenAI has struggled with resource limitations, particularly in acquiring Nvidia chips, which are critical for training advanced AI models. In contrast, Musk\u2019s xAI has reportedly secured a larger supply of these chips, giving it a potential edge in the race to develop innovative AI technologies.\n\nAltman\u2019s leadership is under intense scrutiny as he works to address these challenges while maintaining transparency and trust. The demands of leading an organization at the forefront of AI innovation are immense, and Altman\u2019s ability to navigate these pressures will play a crucial role in shaping OpenAI\u2019s future.\n\nImplications for the Future of AI\n\nThe rivalry between Elon Musk and Sam Altman extends beyond their personal disagreements, shedding light on critical issues that will shape the future of artificial intelligence. As competition intensifies, questions arise about the role of profit motives in driving innovation and whether organizations can balance financial interests with the altruistic goal of creating AI that benefits humanity.\n\nThis conflict highlights the complexities of leadership, trust, and innovation in an industry with fantastic potential. It raises important questions about how to ensure that AI development aligns with ethical principles and societal needs, rather than being driven solely by competitive pressures or financial incentives.\n\nThe outcome of this rivalry will likely have far-reaching implications, influencing not only the pace of technological advancements but also the ethical frameworks that guide the development and deployment of AI. As Musk and Altman continue to shape the industry, their decisions will play a pivotal role in determining the trajectory of artificial intelligence and its impact on society.\n\nMedia Credit: TheAIGRID\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

            "article_content": "In today\u2019s rapidly changing technology landscape, machine learning and AI enable us to redefine industries and change how we interact with the world. AI allows developers to create more intelligent, flexible, and efficient applications. Arm, due to its unique position in the industry, has been enabling AI across a variety of platforms for more than a decade.\n\nIn this article, I want to detail how Arm\u2019s technology allows developers to focus on innovation and the unique aspects of the applications they are developing while utilizing Arm\u2019s existing technology.\n\nYou don\u2019t need an NPU for AI applications For over seven years, I\u2019ve been making content about the advantages and disadvantages of different machine learning accelerators \u2014 called NPUs. These processors have their place in devices, but one myth is that you need one to run machine learning or AI tasks. That\u2019s simply not true. AI tasks don\u2019t hinge exclusively on NPUs; they can run on anything from a CPU to a GPU. With the technology found in Arm v8 and Arm v9 chips, you can run accelerated machine learning tasks particularly well on Arm CPUs.\n\nMatrix multiplication is the key mathematical operation at the heart of machine learning and AI. GPUs and NPUs are good at matrix multiplication. However, modern Arm CPUs are also good at this processing task and have hardware accelerators that enable it, too. Whether it\u2019s Arm v8 or Arm v9, Cortex-A or Cortex-X, or Arm\u2019s Neoverse processors, they all have different technologies that allow the acceleration of matrix multiplication operations.\n\nFor example, Arm\u2019s Neon technology, and Scalable Vector Extensions (SVE) are both available in Arm processors, there are also 8-bit matrix-by-matrix multiplication instructions in the Arm instruction set. In smartphones and on the edge devices, Scalable Matrix Extensions (SME) are available inside Arm processors. These technologies allow the CPU to perform accelerated matrix operations without a GPU or NPU.\n\nArm\u2019s Kleidi technology\n\nArm\n\nBeyond the hardware systems, Kleidi is a central part of Arm\u2019s strategy for enabling AI on Arm-based mobile and server platforms. It covers a range of resources and partnerships for helping developers accelerate AI seamlessly on Arm, including a library of high-performance machine learning kernels called KleidiAI, which has been optimized for Arm CPUs using those various hardware accelerators.Kleidi is available on GitLab, and these kernels have been integrated into various frameworks that are ready for developers to use. As a result, we now have hardware acceleration for Arm CPUs, supporting various machine learning technologies, from classical machine learning to current generative AI.\n\nArm has integrated Kleidi technology into popular AI frameworks such as PyTorch and ExecuTorch, resulting in significant out-of-the-box performance improvements for developers. This integration ensures that developers can seamlessly leverage Arm\u2019s optimized libraries within their existing workflows, gaining up to a 12x performance improvement with minimal effort.\n\nArm partnered with Meta to ensure the recently launched Llama 3.2 model works perfectly on Arm CPUs. The availability of smaller LLMs that enable fundamental text-based generative AI workloads, such as the one billion and three billion parameter versions, is critical for enabling AI inference at scale. Arm CPUs can run larger models, such as Llama 3.2 with 11 billion parameters and even the 90 billion parameter model in the cloud. These larger models are an excellent fit for CPU-based inference workloads in the cloud that generate text and images.\n\nThe 11 billion parameter version of Llama 3.2, running on an Amazon AWS Graviton4 processor, can achieve 29.3 tokens per second during the generation phase, and that\u2019s just on the CPU. Thanks to the collaboration between Arm and Meta on the ExecuTorch framework, you can now access optimal performance by running those models on the edge. Running the new Llama 3.2 three billion LLM on an Arm-powered smartphone through the Arm CPU optimizations leads to a 5x improvement in prompt processing and a 3x improvement in token generation, achieving 19.92 tokens per second during the generation phase.\n\nIf you want a demonstration of this, check out my video above.\n\nA massive boost for developers\n\nArm\n\nThanks to these advancements, the possibilities for developers are enormous. Think of everything you could do with a large language model running on a phone using an Arm CPU \u2014 no GPU, no NPU, no cloud, just the CPU. Arm\u2019s approach is performance portability, which means that AI developers can optimize once and then deploy their models across various platforms without making any modifications. This is particularly useful for developers who need to deploy models both on the edge, in a smartphone, and in the cloud. By using Arm, developers can be sure that their model will also perform well on other platforms once optimized for one platform.\n\nArm has some great resources for developers, including documentation on how to accelerate generative AI and ML workloads when you choose to run them on Arm CPUs, in addition to running AI and ML on Android devices."

It said there were 18 airstrikes, which were particularly powerful because they were consecutive and detonated missiles in warehouses, leading to secondary explosions.\n\nThe Israeli military declined to comment on the strikes. Israeli officials have previously said that the campaign in Syria is an effort to keep military equipment out of the hands of \u201cextremists,\u201d after an alliance of rebel groups ousted the Assad regime earlier this month.

            "article_content": "Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is in free fall, with shares tanking 12% in premarket trading on Monday. This comes hot on the heels of Friday's announcement that it's getting booted from the Nasdaq-100 Index, effective December 23. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), and Axon Enterprise (AXON are stepping in, replacing Super Micro, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), and Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN). For Super Micro, the move caps a brutal nine months that saw its stock lose nearly 70% of its value since hitting a record $118.8 in March. The company's troubles have snowballed, from missed earnings expectations to a delayed annual report filing, auditor resignations, and a Department of Justice probe triggered by short-seller allegations.\n\nBut the hits keep coming. Bloomberg dropped another bombshell, reporting that Super Micro has hired Evercore to explore capital-raising options, including equity sales, debt financing, or private equity investments. This isn't the company's first trip down the capital-raising laneback in March, it sold 2 million new shares to drum up $2 billion. Now, with governance concerns lingering and a February deadline to file overdue reports to avoid Nasdaq delisting, Super Micro is walking a tightrope. Meanwhile, its pivot to BDO as its new auditor underscores a desperate attempt to restore credibility, but investors are clearly skeptical.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Super Micro is teetering on the edge. The Nasdaq removal is a glaring red flag, and while the potential capital raise could buy some breathing room, the company's underlying issuesgovernance gaps, financial reporting delays, and a shrinking market caparen't going away anytime soon. For investors, this might be a wait-and-watch game, but with every misstep, the odds of a turnaround get slimmer. The question now is whether Super Micro can stabilize or if it's destined to be a cautionary tale for growth stocks gone wrong.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\n"

            "article_content": "While members of the 118th Congress will be finished with their lame-duck session this week, lawmakers have yet to release or vote on a year-end legislation package.\n\nAlthough recent negotiations have included funding for the federal government, a Farm Bill extension, economic assistance for agriculture producers and natural disaster recovery aid, Congressional leadership has signaled that the package does not currently include economic assistance.\n\nIn response to this development, the following national ag leaders have issued the following statements over the weekend:\n\nTed McKinney, CEO of the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA):\n\n\u201cFarmers and ranchers are encountering tremendous pressures under high input costs, elevated interest costs, deeply depressed commodity futures markets and poor local cash markets. Additionally, they have experienced powerful headwinds, ranging from extreme weather to uncertain global demand to supply chain disruptions. NASDA calls on Congress to put politics aside and find a resolution that provides the necessary economic aid and disaster assistance for the farmers and ranchers who work every day to provide food security to our country while also feeding the world.\u201d\n\nZippy Duvall, President of the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF):\n\n\u201cAt a time when farm income is in a downward spiral and costs are rising, it\u2019s unacceptable for Congress to turn its back on farmers. Farmers don\u2019t get to set the prices for their goods and right now those prices don\u2019t even come close to covering their costs. We lost 141,000 farms in five years and if Congress fails to include economic aid for farmers, the sad reality is that we\u2019ll lose more.\n\n\u201cOur whole country will suffer the consequences if Congress takes farmers and our food supply for granted. For this reason, I call on members of Congress who represent agriculture to stand with farmers by insisting the supplemental spending bill include economic aid for farmers and voting it down if it doesn\u2019t. In truth, every elected leader who enjoys our affordable and abundant food supply represents agriculture, so I urge them to band together and ensure farmers are supported.\n\n\u201cNearly 80% of Americans believe lawmakers should prioritize legislation that supports farmers and ranchers so it\u2019s just plain unacceptable that our elected leaders are considering putting politics first. I hope reasonable members of Congress take a stand for the good folks who stock their pantries.\u201d\n\nKenneth Hartman Jr, President of the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA):\n\n\u201cWe are deeply disappointed that congressional leadership appears to be at an impasse over crucial economic assistance for farmers in an end-of-the-year legislative package. Corn growers are faced with low prices and high input costs and economic aid would provide them with critical relief during challenging economic times.\n\n\u201cWhile these developments are disheartening, we call on Congress to resume negotiations and pass legislation that includes economic assistance while there is still time.\u201d\n\nCaleb Ragland, President of the American Soybean Association (ASA):\n\n\u201cWe urge congressional leadership to return to the negotiating table and find a path forward. A package that does not include both economic and disaster assistance for our farmers who have suffered significantly from unforgiving market conditions, disastrous weather phenomena and for many, a combination of both, simply does not meet the mark for what agriculture and specifically, our soy growers, need. We will oppose any supplemental spending package that does not provide meaningful assistance to farmers who need help now to stay afloat in 2025 and beyond.\u201d\n\nChandler Goule, CEO of the National Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG):\n\n\u201cNAWG opposes any continued resolution that does not include economic assistance for farmers. We are disappointed that leaders in Congress couldn\u2019t find common ground to provide relief to farmers experiencing a financial crisis and urge them to continue working on a package that meets the needs of rural America. Wheat growers have seen their prices drop by over 36 percent since the 2022/23 marketing year and need the certainty an economic assistance package can provide before the end of the year. Period. Congress has already failed to pass a robust farm bill, and the lack of leadership in reaching an agreement will continue to hurt farmers who feed America and the world.\u201d"

A unique discovery that not only teaches us more about our past, but also shows how unique the story of Roman Heerlen is for the Netherlands,\" Clemens wrote.\n\nAdvert\n\nAfter analysing the gravesite, researchers deduced that Heerlen's first settlement would have been around the Augustan era from around 0 to 20 AD.\n\nThis gravesite was discovered in the midst of excavations at Raadhuisplein, the town square in Heerlen, near a couple of historical roads in Via Belgica and Via Traiana.\n\nIt was found to be an important location in the middle of a Roman settlement named Coriovallum, according to archaeologists.\n\nCariovallum was known for its Roman bathhouse, which is also the oldest stone building in the whole country, built in approximately 40AD.\n\nAdvert\n\nNot only that, but the building also had a restaurant and library, which points towards the area being a multi-purpose building and a place of meeting in Roman times. They really were ahead of their time, weren't they?\n\nA bronze skin scraper, four plates and a bowl were found in the grave with Flaccus (Municipality of Heerlen)\n\nArchaeologists further explained that their findings would give us some new insights into the history of the city, adding: \u201cNever before have we found a Roman grave from this period with a name.\u201d\n\nAs well as Flaccus, they found a bronze skin scraper, four plates and a bowl in the grave, managing to trace the pottery back to ancient Italy, confirming their suspicions that he was a Roman soldier.\n\nAdvert\n\nIn the past, digs in the area have uncovered nothing more than pottery shreds, not proving the presence of a settlement as these items could have been left behind during travel.\n\nFlaccus' grave gave researchers eye-opening evidence that there was a Roman presence in the region, as they further explained: \u201cIt is a unique find because it is not only the oldest Roman grave in Heerlen but also because no name was known there before.\u201d"

I said, 'No, the name kind of sounds familiar, but I don't know him'.\"\n\nTed Jorgensen passed away in 2015 (YouTube/Inside Edition)\n\nJorgensen - who was battling emphysema at the time - spoke of his desire to apologise to his son for what he regarded as the biggest mistake of his life, although getting in touch with a bloke as high-profile as Bezos proved difficult.\n\n\"I would just like to tell him I used to change his diapers and just shake his hand and tell him he's really done a good job with his life,\" he said.\n\nThe bike shop owner, who was based in Phoenix, passed away in March 2015, aged 70.\n\nAccording to Page Six, he never reconnected with Bezos before he died.\n\nWhen asked about Jorgensen in 1999, the billionaire told Wired: \"The reality, as far as I'm concerned, is that my dad [Miguel Bezos] is my natural father.\n\n\"The only time I ever think about it, genuinely, is when a doctor asks me to fill out a form.\"\n\nHe previously praised his adoptive dad for moving to the US from Cuba as a teenager, saying: \"His grit, determination, and optimism are inspiring.\"\n\nBezos - who created Amazon out of his garage in Seattle in 1994 - stepped down as CEO of the company in July 2021.\n\nAccording to Forbes, his current net worth is a whopping $241.2billion."

While the FBI and Home Security authorities have claimed the flying objects pose no threat to national security, conspiracy theorists are rushing ahead with absurd stories of alien invasion, government plots and foreign threats read more\n\nThis photo provided by Trisha Bushey shows the evening sky and points of light near in Lebanon Township, New Jersey, on Thursday, December 5, 2024. AP\n\nOver the US East Coast, a swarm of drones is lighting up the night sky, raising serious concerns and causing confusion.\n\nConspiracy theorists are rushing ahead with absurd claims of alien invasions, political meddling, and foreign threats due to mysterious flying objects.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nWhat do we know about drone sightings in the US?\n\nThere has been a trail of confusion and fear following reports of the mysterious drone sightings in at least six states: New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Virginia.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration reports that the drone sightings started on November 18 in the area of Morris County, New Jersey. Paul Kanitra, a Republican in the New Jersey Assembly, told CNN that since then, drone sightings have occurred every night. They have been observed over significant structures, restricted areas, and residential neighbourhoods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrones were seen over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf property in Bedminster and close to the Picatinny Arsenal, a US military research centre, raising concerns, according to state politicians and military authorities.\n\nAt least one airport, Stewart International Airport in New York, temporarily closed its runways for around an hour on Friday night due to the alleged drone activity.\n\n\u201cThis has gone too far,\u201d New York Governor Kathy Hochul said on Saturday, adding last month she \u201cdirected the New York State Intelligence Centre to actively investigate drone sightings and coordinate with federal law enforcement to address this issue.\u201d\n\nWhat are the authorities saying?\n\nThe sightings have put intense pressure on federal agencies to provide more information about the aircraft.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, addressed the matter on Sunday on ABC\u2019s This Week, becoming the first official to do so on camera. \u201cI want to assure the American public that we are on it.\u201d\n\nHe added the federal government is \u201cdeploying additional resources, personnel, and technology\u201d to address the aerial drones.\n\nNeither President Joe Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris have spoken on the issue in public.\n\nHowever, a number of elected lawmakers and local leaders in New Jersey and along the East Coast have demanded that the flying objects be investigated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul called for increased federal intervention.\n\n\u201cIn response to my calls for additional resources, our federal partners are deploying a state-of-the-art drone detection system to New York State,\u201d Hochul said in a statement. \u201cThis system will support state and federal law enforcement in their investigations.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed this call for action, demanding answers. \u201cI\u2019m pushing for answers amid these drone sightings,\u201d he said, noting that it was \u201cremarkable\u201d that the public still had more questions than answers.\n\nIn New York and New Jersey, Schumer has called for the deployment of \u201cspecial detecting systems,\u201d such as Robin Radar systems as they have a better chance of detecting drones because of their \u201c360-degree technology.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA drone detecting device has been deployed, Connecticut State Police stated Friday, to aid with the investigation of unauthorised drone sightings reported over Fairfield County.\n\nAccording to Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, his administration is \u201caware of\u201d and taking seriously reports of drone sightings.\n\nAccording to the Democratic governor, on Friday night, he gave the Pennsylvania State Police instructions to look into the sightings more closely. Police will use helicopters to try to \u201cdetermine where these drones are originating from and what the purpose of these drones are.\u201d\n\nIs it a threat to national security?\n\nNo.\n\nThe FBI and DHS said in a joint statement on Thursday, saying there is \u201cno evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDHS secretary Mayorkas said, \u201cIt is our job to be vigilant. If there is any reason for concern, if we identify any foreign involvement or criminal activity we will communicate with the American public accordingly. Right now we are not aware of any.\"\n\nNew York State Police said Friday afternoon, in a post on X, they had received \u201cnumerous reports of drone sightings over the past 24 hours\u201d and they were investigating the reports.\n\n\u201cWe have no evidence at this time that any of the reported sightings pose a public safety threat.\u201d\n\nDoes it represent a foreign threat?\n\nNo.\n\nJim Himes, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, appeared on Fox News on Sunday, and said, \u201cThere are a lot of us who are pretty frustrated right now,\u201d Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, told Fox. \u201cThe answer \u2018we don\u2019t know\u2019 is not a good enough answer when people are anxious, when they are nervous, and this has been true since we\u2019ve been a species on this planet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople will fill a vacuum with their fears and anxieties,\u201d Himes said, adding, \u201cOh my god, there\u2019s an Iranian mothership hovering off the coast of Asbury Park!\"\n\n\u201cLet me say something I know with confidence: It is not the Iranians, it is not the Chinese. They aren\u2019t Martians.\u201d\n\nPentagon Spokesperson Sabrina Singh addressed the allegations, saying, \u201cThere is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States, and there\u2019s no so-called mothership launching drones towards the United States.\u201d\n\nWhat are the floating conspiracy theories?\n\nAlthough these instances have been brushed off as non-threatening by federal agencies, the internet is overflowing with wilder theories.\n\nOne of the most prominent is comedian Roseanne Barr, who links mysterious drones to Project Blue Beam, a decades-old conspiracy theory made popular by Infowars founder Alex Jones. According to this theory, the government is getting ready to launch a fictitious alien invasion to impose authoritarian authority and widespread terror on the population.\n\nResearcher Dr. Steven Greer Accurately Predicted The Rollout Of Project Blue Beam That's Happening Now\n\n\n\nWATCH/SHARE THE LIVE X STREAM HERE:https://t.co/iRbKT1cEXq pic.twitter.com/3n27ycFglz \u2014 Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones) December 11, 2024\n\n\u201cNow you see why I mention Project Blue Beam every week on my podcast,\u201d he tweeted on Saturday, fanning the flames of paranoia.\n\nKnown for supporting conspiracies, Jones last week endorsed Project Blue Beam in a conversation with Dr. Steven Greer, a urologist. According to Greer, the world\u2019s elites are planning to use disasters, such as a fake alien invasion, to gain control of the planet.\n\n\u201cThey all have this agenda to want to control the world through one calamity after the other, and the big one they\u2019ve been planning is the hoax of an alien threat from outer space,\u201d Greer warned on the show.\n\nOn the other hand, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, known for making controversial statements, claimed that the government is hiding the facts. \u201cThe government is in control of the drones and refuses to tell the American people what is going on. It really is that bad,\u201d Greene wrote on X.\n\nIn another one, Greene endorsed an idea that drones could be part of a military training programme, perhaps preparing for drone warfare in the future.\n\n\u201cHowever, the government needs to come clean and tell the American people what is going on. That\u2019s the most infuriating part to me,\u201d she added.\n\nMatt Walsh, a Daily Wire commenter, said that the drones might be the result of alien activity, which fuelled followers\u2019 further theories.\n\nSo, what exactly are the flying objects?\n\nAccording to the FBI and DHS, the majority of drone sightings are thought to be cases of \u201cmistaken identity,\u201d whereby members of the public mistakenly identify small, lawfully functioning manned aircraft as drones.\n\nMayorkas told CNN on Friday that some of the sightings might potentially be commercial drones.\n\n\u201cWe know of no threat or nefarious activity,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cIf we learn of any cause for concern, we will be transparent in our communication of it.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, many people own drones, which are an umbrella term for unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nThe FAA has registered 791,597 drones in total, about equally split between commercial and recreational use.\n\nThey are used in a number of fields, including as law enforcement, agriculture, and photography.\n\nAn FBI official reaffirmed during a news briefing on Saturday that the majority of the sightings were manned aircraft that were misidentified as drones. The officer noted that the visual sightings reported to tip lines reflected similar flight approach trends from neighbouring airports.\n\nAccording to the official, out of the 5,000 tips that have been sent to the tip line, less than 100 have resulted in leads that are \u201cdeemed worthy of more investigative activity.\u201d\n\nThe official stated that no proof of \u201clarge-scale UAS activity\u201d had been discovered.\n\nAccording to the FBI official, there has been a \u201cslight overreaction\u201d to the reports.\n\nStill, \u201cwe can\u2019t ignore the sightings that have been there, and we are concerned about those just as much as anybody else is,\u201d the official added.\n\nWith inputs from agencies"

Some of them can even move into the ocean, and then back up to the air. Which is called \u2018transmedium travel.\u2019 A very hard thing to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinuing, DeLonge compared the episode to UFO sightings described in a 1965 document from the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s a repeat of exactly what happened in the \u201860s,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to DeLonge \u2014 who co-founded the company, To the Stars, in 2017 to promote UFO-related theories \u2014 UFOs have a pattern of \u201cmimicking\u201d other aircraft. \u201cThis even happened more recently in situations at Skinwalker Ranch years ago when it was being studied [by] the US Gov under BAAS and AATIP,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd again, also decades ago in the \u201860s. It\u2019s all something to consider.\u201d\n\nDeLonge then wrote, \u201cAlthough we don\u2019t have all the facts yet, we do know that UFOs play with \u2018mimicry\u2019 and that has been known for quite some time. Why? To get us to notice them without a major freak out?\u201d\n\nDeLonge doesn\u2019t claim to have the answers to those questions, but he did conclude with a message to any possible spectators watching from UFOs: \u201cWell, we are noticing nonetheless.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead DeLonge\u2019s full post below.\n\nDeLonge\u2019s UFO enthusiasm has made headlines plenty of time in the past, perhaps most prominently in 2020 when the Pentagon published videos that were previously shared by To the Stars. \u201cWe plan on pursuing the technology, finding more answers and telling the stories,\u201d he said in a statement at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, Blink-182 wrapped their massive reunion tour with a final show in Mexico City last month.

            "article_content": "The Hubble tension is one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology.\n\nIt centers around the Hubble constant\u2014the measurement of how fast our universe is expanding\u2014which comes out as two different numbers when calculated two different ways, even though those numbers should always match.\n\nNow, the James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that this tension is real, rather than a miscalculation or a problem with our equipment. That means there\u2019s something in the underlying physics of our universe that remains a mystery.\n\nThe Hubble tension is one of the most hotly debated discrepancies in all of astronomy. It centers around a number called the Hubble constant, which is functionally the rate at which our universe is expanding. Yup, our infinite universe is expanding. Trippy.\n\nWe\u2019ve known that this expansion is a fact of our cosmos for a while now (we also know that expansion is speeding up, but that\u2019s another story). But we still don\u2019t know exactly how fast this expansion is happening\u2014we don\u2019t know what the Hubble constant is. And it\u2019s not for lack of trying, either.\n\nThere\u2019s a few ways you can measure the Hubble Constant, but there are two major ones. The first, which is how the Hubble Telescope itself does it, is to figure out how fast the things around us are moving away from us. This is done by targeting specific, reliable objects in the sky, calculating the distances to them, and combining those distance with measurements of redshift (a phenomenon that happens when an object moves away from our vantage point, stretching out the light its sending our way and making it appear redder). This is called a local measurement, and it results in a Hubble constant of around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc).\n\nThe second way is to look at the Big Bang. Well, not directly\u2014that\u2019s currently impossible. But we can look at the cosmic microwave background, which is the radiation from the Big Bang that permeates every \u2018corner\u2019 of our universe. By studying this ancient radiation, we can get a reading of what the Hubble constant would have been back when the universe began, and then use our knowledge of the laws of physics to functionally fast-forward and find what that Hubble constant should be now. Using this method, we get a predicted Hubble constant of around 68 km/s/Mpc.\n\nAnd that is the Hubble tension\u2014those numbers should be the same, but they\u2019re not. And when expectation doesn\u2019t match observation in astronomy, it means one of two things: there\u2019s something wrong with our measurement techniques, or there\u2019s something wrong with our understanding of physics.\n\nNow, more and more, it\u2019s looking like the latter. A recent paper\u2014led by Adam Riess, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for his discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating and, by extension, his discovery of dark energy\u2014announced that observations from the James Webb Space Telescope further confirm Hubble\u2019s measurements of the local Hubble constant. According to our absolute best space telescope, the Hubble constant is around 73 km/s/Mpc (which is within the margin of error of the original Hubble measurement), not the ~68 km/s/Mpc it should be.\n\nIt might be fair to have a little bit of a \u201cso what?\u201d reaction to this news. After all, when you boil it down, the only thing we\u2019ve discovered is that there is in fact something we still don\u2019t understand about the expansion of the universe.\n\nBut the excitement behind this announcement comes from the fact that this new measurement confirms that the Hubble tension is real. It\u2019s not a quirk of an old telescope\u2014it\u2019s actually a problem. And that means this isn\u2019t some trivial squabble. There\u2019s something we don\u2019t know about the basic physics that underpin our entire cosmos.\n\nScientists are going to keep pushing to understand exactly what we\u2019re missing that is leading to this discrepancy. And if our scientific history is anything to go by, someday, they\u2019ll figure it out. And when they do, we\u2019re going to have entirely new physics on our hands. How exciting.\n\nYou Might Also Like"

            "article_content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve has identified five species new to global science: a gecko (Hemidactylus sp.) marked by brown stripes and white nodules, the Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus), plus three plants \u2014 a globe thistle, a mignonette, and a hogbean. In addition, the Reserve recorded three species new to Saudi Arabia and extended the known global range of 34 more. These outcomes, the result of four years of fieldwork by Saudi and international experts, increase the total number of terrestrial species documented in the Reserve to 791. Although the Reserve covers only 1% of the Kingdom's terrestrial area, it is home to more than half of Saudi Arabia's terrestrial species, reinforcing its role as a vital refuge for biodiversity in a changing climate.\n\nNewly discovered gecko Hemidactylus sp, in Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve\n\nAndrew Zaloumis, CEO of the Reserve, emphasized the global significance of these findings, stating: \"At a moment in time when the IUCN has warned that 28% of species globally are now at risk of extinction these discoveries are significant. They reaffirm the importance of Prince Mohammed bin Salman Royal Reserve as a bioclimatic refugia, particularly as climate change is increasingly impacting the customary habitats of many of these species. Testament to this is the Reserve's iconic Wadi Al-Disah, with its 200+ species, a key site on the UNESCO World Heritage Bioclimatic Refugia of Western Arabia tentative list. None of this would have been possible without the strong collaboration of natural scientists from the Kingdom and 14 other countries with the Reserve over the last 4 years to conduct multi-season field surveys.\"\n\nAmong the five species new to science are two reptiles and three plants, each with unique ecological and cultural significance. The gecko (Hemidactylus sp.), currently undergoing DNA analysis, features striking brown horizontal stripes from neck to tail and white nodules along its back. This gecko preys on small invertebrates like mosquitoes, playing an essential role in pest control within desert ecosystems. The Hejaz black-collared snake (Rhynchocalamus hejazicus) is a small, non-venomous species that is bright red with a distinctive black collar.\n\nThe three new plants to science are firstly the globe thistle (Echinops sp. aff. glaberrimus) from the Asteraceae family. It produces vibrant blooms that support pollinators and promote ecosystem health. Historically, it has been used medicinally to treat infections and inflammations. Secondly the mignonette, (Reseda sp. aff. muricata), known for its herbal properties, is often used in teas and perfumery. And thirdly, in contrast, the hogbean (Hyoscyamus sp.) from the Nightshade family has a more complex history, having been used both as a poison and in early anesthesiology and palliative care.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "8. RIKEN and NTT launch world first general-purpose optical quantum computer\n\nRIKEN and NTT launched the world\u2019s first general-purpose optical quantum computer in November. The system operates at nearly room temperature and processes at speeds up to several hundred terahertz.\n\nThe computer uses continuous-variable analog design with time-division multiplexing, where computations occur through quantum teleportation. It can handle approximately 100 continuous quantity inputs. The system is accessible through a cloud service and is designed for materials science, chemistry, and AI applications.\n\nOne major benefit of this approach to quantum computing is that it operates at room temperature. By comparison, superconducting qubits and trapped ion cubits operate at temperatures close to absolute zero. According to Riken, the optical quantum computer is also faster than other quantum computing platforms.\n\n9. D-Wave speeds up processing 25,000 times\n\nAnd in yet another kind of quantum computing \u2014 the analog kind \u2014 D-Wave released the benchmark results for its latest 4,400-plus qubit Advantage2 processor in November, with big performance gains. The system solves materials science problems 25,000 times faster than its previous version, the company claims.\n\nThe new processor doubles qubit coherence time and has improved qubit connectivity, enabling solutions to larger problems.\n\nThe system delivered five times better solutions for high-precision applications and outperformed the previous version in 99% of satisfiability problem tests, the company said. It\u2019s available now through D-Wave\u2019s quantum cloud service.\n\nD-Wave\u2019s qubits can\u2019t be directly compared to those of other companies, however, because it\u2019s not a general-purpose computer but a narrow-purpose analog one.\n\n10. Google uses AI to improve error correction\n\nWe can expect to see even more progress on error correction next year. One reason? Artificial intelligence.\n\nIn late November, Google announced an AI system that spots errors in quantum computers. This uses the same transformer technology that\u2019s behind large language models and other types of generative AI, but trained specifically on quantum processes.\n\nThe system is too slow to be actually used in real-time to spot errors, Google says, but, as AI technology improves, it could point to an additional way to reduce error rates.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nSo, when will we have working quantum computers?\n\nAnalysts at the Boston Consulting Group say they\u2019ve been disappointed in the lack of recent progress of actual enterprise use cases.\n\n\u201cQuantum computing today provides no tangible advantage over classical computing in either commercial or scientific applications,\u201d Boston Consulting Group researchers wrote in a July report. \u201cThough experts agree that there are clear scientific and commercial problems for which quantum solutions will one day far surpass the classical alternative, the newer technology has yet to demonstrate this advantage at scale.\u201d\n\nAccording to the firm, our current era, that of \u201cnoisy intermediate-scale quantum\u201d will last until 2030.\n\nAt this stage, quantum computers have too few qubits and too many errors to be practically useful, but they can be used to test algorithms and do other preliminary research.\n\nBroad quantum advantage \u2014 where quantum computers can be used to solve problems that traditional computers can\u2019t handle \u2014 will last from approximately 2030 to 2040, according to the Boston Computing Group. At that time, the research firm predicts that end users will see between $80 and $170 billion in total annual value creations.\n\nIn 2040, according to the research firm, we\u2019ll enter the era of full-scale fault tolerance, and end users will see between $450 and $850 billion of value creation per year. This is when errors are reduced to the point that quantum computers can be scaled up to handle pretty much anything thrown at them.\n\nSome quantum computing companies expect to get there even faster. For example, IBM\u2019s quantum roadmap has the company delivering a fully error-corrected system in 2029. It expects to have a quantum computer with over 2,000 error-corrected qubits \u2014 or logical qubits \u2014 after 2033.\n\nIt takes many physical qubits to create one error-corrected logical qubit, so IBM expects to have a 100,000-qubit computer by then, capable of running 1 billion gates.\n\nIBM is the company to watch, says Gartner\u2019s Dekate. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that IBM is leading,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re innovating at every layer of the stack. But it is early days.\u201d Achieving workable quantum computers is a marathon, he says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the first five minutes.\u201d\n\nWhoever is ahead today might not necessarily win the race, he says. \u201cEnterprises should not fall into the trap of trying to figure out who\u2019s ahead and who\u2019s behind \u2014 that will lead enterprises to make bad decisions, because the leaderboard will change quite dramatically.\u201d\n\nHe suggests that companies looking to take the lead in finding ways to take advantage of quantum computing should partner with multiple vendors and explore different pathways. And, instead of focusing on finding short-term investment returns, they should instead think about skills development, building capabilities, investigating use cases, and preparing for disruptions."

Despite their proven utility, there are still several scientific problems that classical computers cannot tackle.\n\nQuantum computers, which work fundamentally differently than classical computers, have the potential to solve these scientific problems and revolutionize other industries, such as finance, energy, and health care.\n\nScientists and engineers across the U.S. are racing to develop the technologies needed to realize large-scale quantum computing. Yet, the anticipated size of the required workforce far exceeds the number of qualified individuals.\n\nDespite this well-known problem, barriers to learning about quantum computing before graduate school still exist.\n\n\"There are talented high school, community college, and undergraduate students across the country who could thrive in the burgeoning field of quantum information science,\" said Kimberly McGuire, Co-design Center for Quantum Advantage (C2QA) chief operations officer. \"However, they often don't know what working in this field entails or how to pursue a career in quantum.\"\n\nTo increase awareness of quantum opportunities and help grow the U.S. quantum workforce, C2QA, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Quantum Information Science (QIS) Research Center, led by DOE's Brookhaven National Laboratory, hosts several annual outreach programs.\n\nThese programs include the Quantum Thursdays virtual lecture series, the QIS Career Fair, and the Faculty Outreach for Quantum-Invested Universities (FOQUS) program, which cultivates collaboration between individuals from minority serving institutions and researchers across the DOE complex.\n\nC2QA also hosts and co-hosts educational programs that introduce students to the foundational principles of QIS and foster the development of skills needed for a successful career in this rapidly expanding field.\n\nThe programs held this year, including the QIS & Engineering High School-Level Program, QIS 102: Quantum Computing Summer School, and QIS 303: Quantum Error Mitigation, reached more than 170 participants worldwide, from students who just completed their first year of high school to full-fledged QIS researchers\u2014and enthusiastic learners from every level of expertise in between.\n\nLaying the groundwork: Quantum for high school students\n\nQuantum computing integrates advanced knowledge and skills from numerous disciplines, including mathematics, computer science, and quantum physics. These topics are hard to come across in the average high school curriculum, so C2QA and Virginia Tech, a C2QA partner institution, designed a QIS and engineering program accessible to high school students with an understanding of arithmetic and introductory algebra.\n\nDuring this four-day experience, more than 60 students dove into the principles that speed up calculations on quantum computers\u2014and could enable solutions to currently unsolvable problems.\n\nFor example, the students explored \"quantum superposition\" in nontechnical terms. Classical computers, like the ones found in classrooms or offices, store information in bits that can take on values of either 0 or 1. For the sake of this program, they were either black circles or white circles. Quantum computer building blocks, known as qubits, can exist as 0 (white), 1 (black), or in a superposition of these two states, meaning that, loosely speaking, they are both 0 and 1 (white and black) at the same time.\n\nThrough hands-on exercises, the students also explored other quantum concepts, like entanglement and teleportation.\n\n\"These complicated topics are attainable for high school students if you can find a way to present the concepts in a rigorous way that does not rely on advanced math courses,\" said Sophia Economou, a C2QA principal investigator who led the program. Economou is also a professor and T. Marshal Hahn Chair in Physics at Virginia Tech.\n\nThese pictorial representations of abstract concepts were just the start for the students who subsequently designed quantum circuits using IBM Quantum Composter, an online simulation tool from C2QA partner IBM.\n\nWith a game-show-like activity in which a contestant is presented with two identical doors, the students got a glimpse into the impact of quantum computing. In this fantasy game show, a bag of cash is hidden behind at least one door. The other door may or may not have a deadly tiger hiding behind it. Both doors open simultaneously when the contestant pushes a button.\n\nThe catch is that the contestant has only one chance to ask the \"tiger box\" if there is a tiger behind the door of their choice. If the tiger box operated on classical principles, the game show contestant could never be certain about the existence of, or lack thereof, a tiger hiding behind one of those doors. But when they leverage the tiger box with qubits in superposition, the contestant is guaranteed to leave the game show alive\u2014and potentially richer than they were before.\n\nOne student said this demonstration of quantum advantage\u2014when a quantum computer or algorithm outperforms a classical one\u2014was \"the most important part of the program because it gave an actual argument as to why and how quantum systems should be used.\"\n\nAnother shared that the interactive nature of the entire course was \"impactful and long-lasting.\"\n\nUndergraduate students cultivate their coding toolbox\n\nCollege students pursuing science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) degrees are actively developing critical skills for QIS careers\u2014but many are unaware of the quantum capabilities their talents could unlock.\n\nDavid Biersach, a senior technology architect at Brookhaven, authored the C2QA QIS 102: Quantum Computing Summer School to make quantum computing more tangible for students who have demonstrated interest and ability in STEM.\n\nThe 2024 cohort\u2014including 17 undergraduate students, one graduate student, and eight university professors, all from 10 different U.S. states\u2014gathered for 45 virtual sessions over three weeks to build a foundational knowledge of scientific computing and develop their programming skills.\n\n\"You can't rush into quantum computing if you don't know how to program classical computers,\" said Biersach, who also taught the course. He incorporated several days of demonstrations and hands-on programming labs to \"give students time to play so they can develop an enhanced intuition for the novel topics they are exploring.\"\n\nOver 90 classroom hours\u2014the equivalent of a 6.0 credit hour college course\u2014the students covered several cornerstone topics, including coding with Python, quantum mechanics, advanced linear algebra, and scientific computing.\n\nThey also developed real-world quantum algorithms using IBM Qiskit, an open-source software development kit that C2QA partner IBM developed and continuously improves. For example, the students created a hybrid Python-quantum algorithm that increased data compression of network transmissions by 200%, enabling more efficient data transfers and reduced network congestion.\n\nEach aspect of this course contributed to Biersach's goal of teaching the students how to solve real-world science problems with computer code.\n\n\"Eleven lines of code can change the world,\" he explained to the students. The foundational scientific computing skills Biersach taught during QIS 102 not only align with growing market needs but also bolster students' likelihood of earning internships that are \"key to STEM retention.\"\n\nOver the past five years, 27 graduates of Biersach's course have secured positions in the DOE's Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships (SULI) program, and three others have obtained full-time quantum computing positions at world-class corporations.\n\nKatie Harrison, for example, served as a teaching assistant for QIS 101\u2014an earlier iteration of QIS 102\u2014the summer after earning a bachelor's degree in physics.\n\n\"I wasn't sure if graduate school was right for me at that time,\" explained Harrison. \"But assisting with the QIS 101 course showed me that there are so many careers I can pursue with a knowledge of quantum physics and computer science.\"\n\nHarrison opted for a program administrator role at the Chicago Quantum Exchange (CQE), but in her free time she applies the skills she learned from Biersach to independent research projects. One of them resulted in a first-place prize from Microsoft's 2024 QRISE Quantum Computing Competition.\n\nHarrison continued her quantum research with a SULI internship at DOE's Argonne National Laboratory, but she remains dedicated to mentoring the next generation of quantum scientists, just like Biersach.\n\nAt CQE, Harrison connects students with institutions that offer educational programs and other opportunities in quantum science. Earlier this year, she helped organize the Chicago Recruiting Forum, which attracted more than 200 students and 34 institutions.\n\n\"The field of quantum physics is blossoming right now, and I really feel like I can help build a diverse and robust workforce,\" said Harrison. \"My experience with QIS 101 inspired me to reach out to students and others who are curious about the exciting opportunities in this field.\"\n\nBeyond preparing students for the next steps in their education and career, QIS 102 is a particularly accessible opportunity. All participants received a weekly stipend, enabling them to prioritize a learning experience that has already enhanced the career trajectories of several alumni.\n\nBiersach often receives emails from these alumni sharing how his quantum computing program inspired them to take more advanced QIS courses at their respective universities\u2014and recounting times they revisited his course materials for help with machine learning or linear algebra concepts.\n\nMorgan Beck, a 2023 graduate of QIS 102 who assisted Biersach with the 2024 program, said, \"Before participating in this course, I didn't think of myself as a programmer. Now, I see it is not only possible but necessary\u2014and thoroughly exciting\u2014to be both a scientist and a programmer.\n\n\"The QIS course avoids abstract metaphors while providing transferable and concrete skills for coding in scientific research,\" Beck added. \"Dr. Biersach inspires genuine curiosity and a love of learning in his students, making them feel capable of diving deeper on their own. I wish every undergraduate student in STEM could take a course like QIS 102.\"\n\nQuantum practitioners elevate their error-mitigation expertise\n\nIn their pursuit of large-scale quantum computing, researchers face a major barrier known as \"noise.\" It may arise from environmental disturbances, imperfections in quantum materials, or unintentional interactions between qubits, and it causes disruptive errors in the calculations performed by quantum computers.\n\nThe noise, unfortunately, is inevitable, so quantum researchers are actively working on methods to mitigate and suppress the errors and maintain the integrity of quantum calculations.\n\nStony Brook University professors and C2QA principal investigators Dmitri Kharzeev and Tzu-Chieh Wei are well-versed in the leading techniques. So, they designed a four-day workshop called QIS 303: Quantum Error Mitigation to discuss them with graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and other quantum practitioners.\n\n\"Noise and the errors it causes are among the main challenges to achieving quantum advantage\u2014where quantum computers outperform their classical counterparts. Consequently, quantum error mitigation stands at the forefront of quantum computing,\" said Kharzeev. \"Our school brought together leading global experts and enthusiastic students to explore this critical topic.\"\n\nThe course comprised lectures from QIS experts and supplementary office hours with the researchers. Among the experts was Nathan Wiebe, a University of Toronto professor and joint appointee at DOE's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) who leads C2QA's Software & Applications Thrust.\n\nQIS 303: Quantum Error Mitigation was the third addition to C2QA's 300-level virtual series. The first courses, QIS 301: Quantum Characterization, Verification, and Validation and QIS 302: A Practical Guide to Superconducting Qubit Experiments, were held in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Each course's lectures were recorded and are available online, making these opportunities available to anyone with an internet connection.\n\nQIS research opportunities for DOE interns\n\nIn addition to facilitating several educational programs, C2QA researchers from across the country mentored interns as part of the DOE's Community College Internships (CCI) and SULI programs. The CCI and SULI programs offer students the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge science at a DOE national laboratory.\n\nIn 2024, C2QA researchers from four DOE national laboraties\u2014Ames Laboratory, Brookhaven Lab, PNNL, and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab)\u2014welcomed CCI and SULI students into their labs, offering them opportunities to hone key quantum research skills and grow their professional networks. Ames Laboratory, PNNL, and Jefferson Lab are C2QA partner institutions.\n\nAleida Perez, interim manager of Brookhaven's Office of Educational Programs, said, \"It is a pleasure to collaborate with C2QA and support their mission through programs like QIS 102, the WDTS Visiting Faculty Program, and the CCI and SULI internship programs. These opportunities not only provide students and faculty with access to Brookhaven's scientific tools but also foster long-lasting connections.\"\n\nThis summer, PNNL hosted over 1,700 interns and research associates and provided them with access to the PNNL \"Gold Experience,\" which includes professional development, networking, and mentorship. One facet of the 2024 Gold Experience was a three-part QIS professional development series, which kicked off with an \"Introduction to QIS\" workshop with C2QA Deputy Director Kai Mei Fu. Fu holds appointments at the University of Washington and PNNL.\n\nDuring the second event, students explored quantum physics and materials science characterization projects at PNNL. The series concluded with a panel of PNNL and Brookhaven Lab researchers who shared their journeys to QIS careers, illustrating how diverse backgrounds and skill sets can open doors to opportunities in the field.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThis year, C2QA and its partners made notable strides in their educational initiatives, with the center's influence growing into local communities.\n\nEducators from Freeport High School, for example, collaborated with Biersach to develop a semester-long course inspired by QIS 102. Located just 50 miles southwest of Brookhaven Lab, Freeport became the first school district on Long Island, New York, to offer a quantum computing course, which launched earlier this fall.\n\nAs C2QA enters its fifth year, plans for 2025 programs are already underway.\n\nIn June, Biersach will teach QIS 100, a six-week-long iteration of C2QA's quantum computing summer school. The expanded format\u2014double the length of 2024's QIS 102 \u2014will offer students more time to engage with active quantum researchers and write Qiskit code to run on IBM-hosted quantum computers.\n\nC2QA and Virginia Tech also plan to host their high school program in August 2025. The application period for this program and QIS 100 will open in early 2025.\n\n\"As a center, we are committed to making a positive impact on the QIS ecosystem,\" said McGuire. \"The successes of our students, who have used their experiences with C2QA programs as a launching pad, validate that we are doing our part to build a diverse and robust QIS workforce.\"\n\nShe added, \"We look forward to what 2025 holds for our programs and our students.\"\n\nProvided by Brookhaven National Laboratory"
