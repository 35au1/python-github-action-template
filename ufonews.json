We may get a commission if you buy through our links.\n\nMicrosoft introduced its new CoreAI platform and tools designed to develop AI-powered applications. CEO Satya Nadella announced the news in a communication to Microsoft employees, stating that the shift towards AI-powered applications is set to define 2025 and beyond.\n\nAccording to Nadella, the next three years will see \u201cthirty years of change\u201d as AI models become a fundamental part of every software application category, from CRM and ERP systems to industry-specific platforms.\n\nHowever, while the capabilities of these AI-powered applications are set to increase significantly \u2013 with the introduction of \u201cagents\u201d that can remember past interactions and carry out a range of tasks \u2013 the way software is built is also changing.\n\nThe Microsoft CEO said the shift towards AI-first applications is \u201cleading to a new AI-first app stack \u2014 one with new UI/UX patterns, runtimes to build with agents, orchestrate multiple agents, and a reimagined management and observability layer.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the Redmond-based tech giant is creating a new engineering organization focused on building the tools and platforms needed for this new era of software.\n\nCoreAI \u2013 Platform and Tools will bring together various existing teams at Microsoft, including Dev Div, the company\u2019s AI platform team, and several groups at the Office of the CTO, including those working on AI Supercomputer, AI Agentic Runtimes, and Engineering Thrive.\n\nThe new group will be led by Jay Parikh, who previously served as Facebook\u2019s head of infrastructure. Parikh will report to Scott Guthrie, Microsoft\u2019s Cloud + AI chief, and will work closely with Rajesh Jha, Microsoft\u2019s EVP of Experiences and Devices, and Charlie Bell, the company\u2019s CTO, to help Microsoft\u2019s entire tech stack become AI-savvy. Parikh will also be in charge of GitHub Copilot, Microsoft\u2019s AI-powered code-writing tool.\n\nIn a memo to employees, Nadella said that Microsoft has been working on the technology to enable the next generation of software for over two years.\n\nBut to truly accelerate our progress and take full advantage of the opportunity in front of us, we need to operate as one company from our tech stack to products to customer engagement to go-to-market.\n\nMicrosoft has made several moves in recent months to accelerate its AI ambitions. For example, last November, the company unveiled the Azure AI Foundry, a unified platform that gathers all the tools developers need to build AI-powered apps.\n\nIn September, Microsoft unveiled a new series of AI accelerators for Azure, which include chips that the company says will enable more powerful and efficient AI model training.\n\nYou can read Satya Nadella\u2019s announcement here."

I just thought, \"Christ, what was that?\" At the back of your mind, you wonder if it\u2019s the ghost'\n\nAfter his peculiar experience, Shaun said he began to notice early signs of paranormal activity in his home when the builders at his home noticed 'a woman upstairs looking out at us'\n\nShaun is renowned for playing Barry Evans for a decade in the BBC soap (pictured in 2003)\n\nShaun later said there was reportedly the spirit of a man named George, who murdered his wife in the 1900s.\n\nHe said: 'So he\u2019s just a wrongen, George is an a******* and he had to go.\n\n'That\u2019s why I\u2019m really glad of this programme, because now, even if bits of his spirit remain, it\u2019s not doing any harm.'\n\nCelebrity Help!

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."

            "article_content": "The sprawling grounds of France\u2019s opulent Palace of Versailles are not only a masterpiece of landscaping, but a mark of 17th-century engineering innovation. The property\u2019s ornamental fountains and ponds, for example, were only made possible by a specially built machine that pulled water from the Seine and pushed it up a steep hill to Versailles.\n\nThe machine was designed at the request of the French king Louis XIV\u2014the monarch who commissioned Versailles, also known as the Sun King. His and his successors\u2019 courts are mainly remembered for ostentatious finery, but their immense wealth also enabled discovery, and Versailles turned into a hotbed for science: a theme explored by a new exhibition at the Science Museum in London: \u201cVersailles: Science and Splendor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe exhibition highlights how science flourished at Versailles, from the kings\u2019 personal interest in luxurious scientific instruments and spectacular demonstrations, to its strategic role beyond the palace through newly founded institutions and scientific expeditions,\u201d says Glyn Morgan, the museum\u2019s curatorial lead for exhibitions, in a statement.\n\nThe show spans the 17th and 18th centuries, covering the reigns of Louis XIV (who founded the French Academy of Sciences in 1666), Louis XV and Louis XVI (who was executed in 1793 during the French Revolution). Through more than 120 artifacts, the exhibition illustrates the importance of art and science in the French royal court.\n\nMany of the objects show innovations in medicine, such as a curved scalpel designed by Louis XIV\u2019s royal surgeon, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9lix. When the king developed a royal anal fistula, his surgeon had to invent a customized scalpel. F\u00e9lix tested his tool on local peasants, killing several in the process. As the Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Jones writes, \u201cThe rehearsals worked: He fixed the royal fistula and Louis XIV lived on until 1715, his 72-year reign a world record.\u201d\n\nUnder the reign of Louis XV (who ruled between 1715 and 1774), a midwife called Madame du Coudray became a powerful force against French infant mortality. The king hired her to travel throughout rural France to train other midwives in the mechanics of birth, employing \u201csophisticated life-sized mannequins,\u201d per the statement. Du Coudray ultimately educated more than 5,000 women and physicians, and her last surviving model is on display in the exhibition.\n\nAfter Louis XV died of smallpox, his son and successor Louis XVI announced that the royal family would get inoculated. Included in the exhibition are posters made to reassure the public of the strategy\u2019s success.\n\nScience at Versailles extended to the wonders of the natural world. French botanists grew and studied exotic plants. Versailles had a menagerie stocked with animals like coatis and cassowaries. Visitors to the Science Museum will be able to see the menagerie\u2019s most famous resident: Louis XV\u2019s rhinoceros, given to the king by a French governor based in India and later dissected and taxidermied upon its death.\n\n\u201cAs it was studied by scientists, it became incredibly important to our growing zoological knowledge,\u201d as Morgan tells the Observer\u2019s Vanessa Thorpe. \u201cThe photographs really did not do justice to just how impressive and characterful it is. The skin is almost jet black.\u201d\n\nAlso on display are philosopher Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s handwritten, annotated French translation of Isaac Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica; the watch made for Louis XVI\u2019s wife, Marie Antoinette, by Abraham-Louis Breguet; and an early map of the moon drawn by Jean-Dominique Cassini in 1679. The French Revolution claimed the lives of some of the French royal court\u2019s thinkers, but their advances were permanent. Per the Guardian, \u201cScience strode on.\u201d\n\n\u201cRoyal ambition, scientific knowledge and ideals of beauty culminated at Versailles in spectacular demonstrations and brilliant innovations from the brightest minds of the time,\u201d says Ian Blatchford, director and chief executive of the Science Museum Group, in the statement. \u201cWe are thrilled to introduce our visitors to these fascinating stories through the stunning objects on display.\u201d\n\n\u201cVersailles: Science and Splendor\u201d is on view at the Science Museum in London through April 21, 2025."

            "article_content": "OpenAI has appointed an executive at investment firm BlackRock to its board of directors.\n\nAdebayo \u201cBayo\u201d Ogunlesi, a senior managing director at BlackRock and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure investing platform, has joined OpenAI\u2019s board, OpenAI announced on Tuesday. In a statement, OpenAI board chairman Bret Taylor said that Ogunlesi has \u201can exceptional track record of driving success in organizations with global reach, expertly navigating complex, and dynamic commercial landscapes.\u201d\n\nOgunlesi spent 23 years at financial services company Credit Suisse, where he held several positions, including executive vice chairman of Credit Suisse\u2019s investment banking division. Previously, Ogunlesi was an attorney with the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, and served as a law clerk to Thurgood Marshall, the nation\u2019s first Black U.S. Supreme Court Justice.\n\nOgunlesi also sits on the boards of BlackRock, Topgolf Callaway Brands, Kosmos Energy Holdings, and Terminal Investment Limited.\n\n\u201cThe rapid advancement and development of AI offers a unique opportunity to build a better future. As part of this, thoughtful strategies and investment in infrastructure will be key to unlocking AI\u2019s full potential and delivering its benefits responsibly,\u201d Ogunlesi said in a press release. \u201cI\u2019m excited to contribute to this effort and look forward to being a part of the OpenAI board.\u201d\n\nOpenAI\u2019s current board bares little resemblance to its board in late 2023, the members of which fired CEO Sam Altman only to reinstate him days later. As a condition for returning, Altman demanded a remade board \u2014 and he eventually got his wish.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s board today includes Taylor, Altman, Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former NSA director Paul M. Nakasone, former Sony Corporation of America President Nicole Seligman, Instacart CEO Fidji Simo, economist Larry Summers, and Carnegie Mellon computer scientist Zico Kolter. D\u2019Angelo is the sole holdover from the previous board."

However, experts predict that the men\u2019s consumer will find new, fun ways to express their personal style this year, with a focus on colour and texture over silhouette, and fun unconventional styling to spice up the plain old suit.\n\nWhile there\u2019s always off-the-wall outlier trends \u2014 like last year\u2019\u2019s #grandpacore \u2014 many of the moods for next season are evolutions or mashups of trends we\u2019ve seen before, as consumers focus on quality and longevity from their clothes.\n\nHere, Vogue Business breaks down the key trends to watch.\n\nMinimalist fits, unconventional accents\n\nMinimalism will continue to dominate menswear for Autumn/Winter 2025, with a focus on clean lines, good-quality fabrics and clothes to last, over micro-trends and flash-in-the-pan viral products.\n\n\u201cIn an era where style exploration is often co-opted and flattened into manufactured subjectivities, we find ourselves retreating to what was once prescribed: uniforms,\u201d says Agus Panzoni, head of trends at media company Death to Stock and trends expert at Depop."

            "article_content": "It's 2025, and while AI hasn't yet figured out how to explain cricket to Americans, it is reshaping marketing in ways we could barely imagine a decade ago.\n\nLet's dive into five trends driving this shift.\n\n\n\n- Hyper-personalisation hits its stride\n\nRemember when targeted ads used to be creepy? Like when you'd Google \"how to get rid of pigeons\" and suddenly see pigeon deterrents all over your Instagram?\n\nAI has matured beyond these blunt-force algorithms. In 2025, hyper-personalisation means understanding customers at a level that borders on mind-reading but in a way that feels organic.\n\nBrands now use AI not just to predict what you want but also to frame it in the context of your mood, environment, and even your ethical beliefs.\n\nYour morning coffee ad might subtly switch to \"sustainable sourcing\" messaging after your fitness app logs a yoga session. AI is blending consumer data into narratives that feel tailor-made for every micro-moment.\n\nFun fact: The word \"personalisation\" appeared in print for the first time in 1911. What would the Victorians think of algorithms analysing their shopping carts?\n\n\n\n- Synthetic media becomes the norm\n\nImagine you're watching an ad. The actor, the voiceover, and even the set don't exist-they've all been created by AI. Welcome to synthetic media.\n\nIn 2025, it is projected that 90% of online content will be generated or influenced by AI and the ad creative process is likely to be influenced similarly once everyone runs out of moral outrage, as we have seen in the recent Coca-Cola ad backlash.\n\nWhile synthetic media makes it cheaper and faster to produce content, it also opens doors to mind-blowing creativity.\n\nNeed a character that embodies \"timeless elegance\"? AI can combine Audrey Hepburn's poise with modern fashion trends, without resorting to digital necromancy. This ability to create infinite variations of ad creative is fundamentally changing A/B testing.\n\n\n\n- Conversational AI replaces static touchpoints\n\nWebsites, phone home screens and app menus are starting to feel old-fashioned. Why navigate dropdown menus when you can just ask?\n\nConversational AI is turning static touchpoints-websites, apps, even customer service scripts-into dynamic interactions. In 2025, this trend will go far beyond chatbots. We will see fully integrated AI personalities acting as brand ambassadors.\n\nThese AIs remember your past interactions, can recommend new products, and even discuss your preferences like a personal shopper.\n\nSome brands are taking it further. Imagine a whisky brand creating a conversational AI \"bartender\" that suggests the perfect drink based on your taste. It's not just customer service's customer experience elevated.\n\nFun fact: In 1943, the US Army commissioned the first 'chatbot' to train soldiers in Morse code by automatically playing lines of code for them to decode.\n\n\n\n- AI-Powered ethics monitoring\n\nThe ethical spotlight is intense in 2025, and AI is its enforcer.\n\nRegulations like GDPR felt revolutionary in their day, but AI can police marketing campaigns in real time.\n\nBrands use AI to analyse ad copy, creative, and targeting parameters to ensure they don't cross ethical lines.\n\nThis means no more accidentally serving luxury car ads to people who've just filed for bankruptcy.\n\nInterestingly, AI also helps brands align their messaging with broader societal issues. For example, during water shortages in Cape Town, brands now pivot their campaigns in hours, not weeks, to focus on sustainability messaging.\n\nMarketing is no longer just about selling; it is about navigating an ethical minefield, and AI will potentially act as a guide through this tricky terrain.\n\n\n\n- The Rise of the AI marketing supply chain\n\nMarketing used to be a disjointed process-creative here, media buying there, and reporting over in some other silo. In 2025, AI will stitch the entire supply chain together into a seamless flow.\n\nFrom predictive audience segmentation to real-time bidding to automated post-campaign analysis, AI is eliminating inefficiencies.\n\nIt's not just about automation; it's about intelligence. Why spend weeks analysing campaign data when AI can identify insights in milliseconds?\n\nThis trend is giving rise to new roles. Marketers are becoming \"prompt engineers,\" designing the instructions that guide AI systems. The ones who thrive are those who can blend creativity with technical curiosity.\n\nThe Human in the loop\n\nThese trends make one thing clear: marketing in 2025 is as much about understanding machines as it is about understanding people. But it is just as clear as ever that the more intelligent AI becomes, the more important human creativity and empathy are.\n\nAI can tell you what works, but it can't tell you why it moves someone. It can generate a million variations of an ad, but it takes a human to connect it to the cultural moment or craft a message with soul.\n\nThe future of marketing isn't AI replacing humans, it is AI amplifying the human touch. In a world of infinite possibilities, the most valuable skill may simply be asking the right questions.\n\nThe history of marketing is one of evolution, driven by technology. The printing press gave us ads; radio and TV brought jingles and soap operas. Today, AI is the next step in this legacy.\n\nAll rights reserved. \u00a9 2022.

            "article_content": "A lot of your personal information is stored online n one place or another. Or, as the case may be, in data conglomerates (aka \u201cdata brokers\u201d) that specialize in collecting financial, health, relationship, and other types of data about you and others. One of the best ways to defend against this data collection is to take a proactive stance, opting out whenever possible and asking to be removed as much as possible. An easy way to do this is to use Incogni, a service dedicated to removing your personal info from the internet. Right now you can get this service for 55% off of an annual plan if you use the code DIGITALDEAL when you check out. That brings the cost to $81 from $180, and saves you $99 for the year. Tap the button below to check it out yourself, or keep reading to see what makes Incogni special.\n\nUse Incogni to keep your private info private\n\nAccess to your private info is like an onion, it has layers. (Speaking of onions, check out the best VPNs for more ways to stay secure online.) The first layer is those so-called \u201cpeople search sites\u201d that give out your address and phone number, like a sort of digital phone book. When you sign up for Incogni these are the first sites you\u2019ll see lose your info. This can do everything from reducing spam calls to keeping your home\u2019s location a bit more private.\n\nAnd this outer layer is where many services stop. However, Incogni goes for the deeper stuff, too. The next layer targets other types of data brokers, including the ones that you can\u2019t easily access from a name search. We\u2019re talking about the ones that hold onto health information, relationship status, and your private interests. In other words, stuff that you might not want put out into the world via a data leak. Incogni will also go the extra mile by repeatedly contacting these sites for you so you don\u2019t reappear, negotiate with the sites on your behalf, and just generally automate the process for you.\n\nThis means that the most proactive you have to be about your digital data with Incogni is upon startup. Remember, if you start using Incogni now you can get it for a year at 55% off with code DIGITALDEAL. This drops the price from $180 to just $81, saving you $99. Just tap the button below and follow the sign up instructions to get started. Then, go check out the top tech of CES this year, that you\u2019ll be able to put in your now more private home."

Many items such as safety glass (1903) taken for granted in today\u2019s windscreens but one of earliest uses was in gasmasks, for troops in WWI. Vaseline (1870) an accidental find, when \u2018gunk on pipes\u2019 was used by troops as a staple; to sooth burns, wounds and trench foot.\n\nSimple items, such as matches (1826), are taken for granted. Superseded by lighters, they play a part in history. Even 25 years after the war, men lighting cigarettes would only light one, then another, before putting the match out and starting again. This habit was engrained because during the war a sniper could use a bullet to \u2018home in\u2019 and take out the third light.\n\nCoco-Cola (1826) yet another derivative from \u2018war\u2019 when its American inventor, following his experience in American Civil War, wanted to create an opiate free drink, to alleviate his addiction to morphine. Unfortunately, caffeine and stimulants still included, offended the Temperance Movement insisting it be alcohol free so, changes resulted in a sugar syrup concoction of carbonated water. Dynamite (1847) invented by a lab chemist, very wary of progressing development when conscious it was more powerful than gunpowder, yet more volatile. However not deterred, his colleague, saw the potential in mining, demolition and armament for war. Play-Doh\u2019s inventor nearly went bankrupt, when changes in society changed his customer base.\n\nPre 1942 homes heated with coal, left sooty deposits on walls and this was used as a cleaning product, until post war electric and gas meant soot was less of an issue. Bankruptcy was only avoided because the inventor\u2019s sister took it into a primary school, to use as modelling clay, initially called Rainbow Craft, before developing the product we know today.\n\nAccidents continue; Cornflakes as a healthy veg option, developed when boiled wheat left to go soggy was put in an oven to crisp up. The initial microwave (1967) was 5 ft tall, weighing 750lbs yet; few homes are now without one. Similarly, the most common used antibiotic in the world Penicillin, developed by accident after its inventor left a messy worktop, which became mouldy.\n\nAnother invention, much taken for granted; smoke detectors save millions of lives because, in fires smoke kills. Potato chips unbelievably resulted when a disgruntled customer complained about the thickness of his fries. The annoyed chef sliced potatoes using a mandolin to irritate him but unexpectedly another \u2018product\u2019 became an everyday one. Concluding, Viagra developed medically for Angina; like every other product highlighted, has other uses and made billions of dollars - by accident!\n\nAnne concluded with Chairman\u2019s Cheer and Thought for the Day; \u201cEvery day may not be good but there is something good in every day.\u201d\n\nRetired or Semi-Retired, professional or business ladies meet on the first Thursday each month at Chase Golf Club, 12 noon, to share meal, fellowship and speakers with outings and other activities.

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."

Three of Qventus's health system customers, Northwestern Medicine, HonorHealth, and Allina Health, joined the round, along with previous Qventus investor Bessemer Venture Partners.\n\nAD\n\nThe funding comes as Qventus ramps up its new AI-powered assistant tech, built in partnership with Northwestern Medicine and other health systems. The startup's software, launched in August, aims to automate a range of non-clinical tasks before and after surgery, including messaging with patients, making phone calls to other healthcare organizations to retrieve a patient's medical records, and sending and receiving faxes.\n\nQventus has spent more than a decade building technology to automate hospital operations such as surgical scheduling. Founded in 2012, it's raised $200 million to date from investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, and Mayfield Fund.\n\nThe new AI assistant tech is supercharging Qventus's growth, CEO Mudit Garg told Business Insider.\n\nAD\n\n\"They've had the fastest uptake of anything we've built in the past 10 years and very high resonance with customers,\" Garg said of the operational assistants. \"That's accelerating the whole process and the speed at which we bring new solutions to market.\"\n\nThe $105 million Series D round included $20 million of venture debt and $85 million of equity financing. Garg declined to share what firm provided the debt financing.\n\nQventus's Series D funding is one of multiple mega-rounds announced already this year, joining January raises including Hippocratic AI's $141 million Series B round and Innovaccer's $275 million Series F round. The deals are a clear signal of healthcare VC's priorities in 2025 \u2014 Qventus, Hippocratic, and Innovaccer all center AI in their pitches.\n\nAD\n\nOver a decade after Qventus's launch, more startups are cropping up to use AI to tackle healthcare's administrative burdens. General Catalyst-backed Fabric has been racking up acquisitions to help manage emergency room patients. In mental health, Jimini Health raised a $8 million pre-seed round in November for its AI that automates patient intake and offers around-the-clock messaging between therapy sessions.\n\nGarg said Qventus hopes to hit cash flow breakeven by the end of 2025. The startup has never made an acquisition, but its team is considering M&A opportunities as the company continues to grow. Still, Garg noted, \"It's always a tradeoff.\"\n\n\"We definitely will be looking, but it's not part of our core thesis,\" he said.\n\nAD\n\nDespite Qventus's late-stage funding round, Garg isn't thinking about an exit just yet. \"There's plenty of cash in the business,\" he said.\n\nThis year, Qventus is focused on building out new use cases for its tech, including automation tailored to complex surgical specialties like oncology and cardiology, Garg said.\n\nThe startup is also ramping up its hiring, especially in its engineering department, as it signs on more customers and brings new capabilities to existing contracts.\n\nHere's the 17-slide pitch deck Qventus used to raise $105 million from KKR."

            "article_content": "Organizations are becoming more aware of the link between team well-being and success as they observe how high-performing teams that are also happy and healthy showcase increased productivity, resilience, and innovative spirit. However, many still struggle to cultivate such teams sustainably. Walking Talking, an innovative self-service platform emerges as a solution. It offers companies the tools to integrate daily communication, collaboration, and physical activity into their workflows, promoting happier and more cohesive teams.\n\n\u201cOur mission with Walking Talking is to transform the way teams interact and collaborate. We believe that by combining movement with meaningful conversation, we can create a more dynamic, healthy, and productive work environment. It\u2019s not just about taking steps; it\u2019s about taking steps together towards better teamwork and well-being,\u201d Anna-Lina Kvarnsmyr, Founder and CEO, says.\n\nThe Walking Talking app combines cutting-edge technology with evidence-based practices to support daily team engagement. It provides tools for planning and conducting walking meetings, scheduling via a map interface, and enabling remote audio chats. Users can create agendas, track steps, and access micro-learning modules tailored to team development. The app also supports collaboration through curated team workshop guides, private networks as well as step challenges, encouraging physical activity and team cohesion.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nWalking Talking is built on the three foundational pillars of communication, collaboration, and movement, allowing it to create a culture of engagement and well-being. As a Sweden-based company, it has always been committed to helping organizations cultivate happier and healthier teams. Swedish cultural values shaped the app\u2019s ethos, particularly emphasizing work-life balance and active lifestyles. In Sweden, \u201cwalk and talk\u201d is a long-standing tradition where movement and meaningful conversation are intertwined. More global organizations are adopting Swedish-inspired practices, and Walking Talking intends to bring this cultural wisdom to international workplaces.\n\nThere are multiple challenges within organizations that impact team performance and employee satisfaction. Middle managers face immense pressure to align with senior leadership\u2019s goals while managing their teams\u2019 day-to-day operations. This dual responsibility leaves them stretched thin, resulting in stress, burnout, and decreased efficiency both for themselves and in their teams. Gallup highlights this reality revealing that this \u2018manager squeeze\u2019 strengthens the manager\u2019s intent to leave but also affects the overall employee engagement.\n\nThe rise of remote and hybrid work environments complicates matters further. It has led to increased sedentary behaviors, introducing new problems to health. Employees working from dispersed locations also report feelings of isolation and detachment from their teams. Meanwhile, leaders must foster inclusive environments where every voice is heard and valued. This disconnection prevents collaboration and diminishes a shared sense of purpose.\n\nMany organizations have attempted to address team well-being and productivity through traditional methods but failed to deliver lasting results. Some have sent managers to training courses, believing they may provide theoretical insights. However, these are rarely applied effectively in day-to-day work environments. Social team-building events like retreats or recreational activities have temporarily boosted morale, but they do little to resolve structural and interpersonal issues.\n\n\u201cTraditional approaches to team building often fall short. While training courses and team retreats can provide temporary boosts, they rarely translate into lasting change in the day-to-day work environment. At Walking Talking, we believe in integrating collaboration, communication, and movement into the fabric of daily work life, addressing both structural and interpersonal challenges sustainably,\u201d Anna-Lina says.\n\nOthers have hired external consultants to address team dynamics. The problem is that after consultants provide expert advice, their impact dissipates once they leave because the knowledge they impart isn\u2019t embedded within the organization. Some companies turned to mindfulness or self-help apps to address stress and disengagement but left the root problems unresolved.\n\nWalking Talking recognizes the limitations of these conventional methods. It offers a comprehensive, science-based solution to the challenges organizations face. It developed a platform grounded in the science of team development and nurtures behavioral change that can be fully integrated into daily workflows.\n\nThe app\u2019s framework was also inspired by established theories of group development, such as Susan Wheelan\u2019s Integrated Model of Group Development. This model emphasizes the importance of trust, collaboration, and structured communication in building high-performing teams.\n\nThe founders established Walking Talking to address the growing problems of isolation, sedentary lifestyles, and disengagement in the workplace. The app, launched in December 2020, initially aimed to connect individuals through walking and talking. It evolved into a tool for organizational transformation over time, aiding companies to build stronger, more engaged teams.\n\nFor CEO Anna-Lina the motivation behind Walking Talking is personal. She witnessed the impact of workplace stress on her own family and experienced the challenges of corporate life firsthand, prompting her to create a solution that could make a real difference. \u201cAll of us at Walking Talking are driven by our desire to make work not only healthier but also more efficient. Poor collaboration and a lack of movement are wasteful. Walking brings physical energy and mental clarity. It helps people think smarter and work better,\u201d Kvarnsmyr states.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that everyone in the organization benefits from the Walking Talking app. Leaders gain a support system that helps them manage their teams more effectively while reducing stress. Meanwhile, team members obtain clarity and structure in their roles. Gone are the days when they feel frustrated due to unclear responsibilities or a disconnect from their team\u2019s goals. Consequently, HR professionals can use Walking Talking as an ongoing resource for fostering a positive work culture from the ground up, reducing their reliance on external consultants or one-off training sessions.\n\nWalking Talking\u2019s impact speaks for itself. The app boasts over 30,000 installations, already changing the way teams work. It has also attracted 17,000 registered members and trained 22 certified leadership trainers. These numbers attest to its ability to create lasting change.\n\nWalking Talking, through its revolutionary app, aims to change how organizations approach team development and employee well-being. It remains committed to integrating communication, collaboration, and movement into daily work practices to provide a holistic and sustainable solution to the challenges of modern workplaces.\n\nDigital Trends partners with external contributors.

First, the company recommends creating nationwide \"rules of the road\" for AI to avoid a fragmented state-by-state approach. Image Credit: Reuters\n\nOn Monday, OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, unveiled a comprehensive \u201ceconomic blueprint\u201d outlining its vision for AI competition and regulation. This strategic plan is designed to guide tech policy in the US as a new administration takes power.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s recommendations come at a time when Elon Musk, a vocal critic of the company, is expected to play a prominent role in Washington. The company is keen to solidify its position and ensure that the US stays ahead in the global race for AI development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFocus on US-made AI and equitable access\n\nAt the heart of OpenAI\u2019s recommendations is the desire to promote AI made in the US, ensuring that emerging technologies are not shaped by authoritarian governments like China. The company argues that AI should be developed in a way that benefits all regions of the country, not just the tech-heavy coastal cities.\n\nOpenAI stresses the need for equitable access to AI, aiming to ensure that its advantages are available to everyone from the very start. According to OpenAI\u2019s VP for global affairs, Chris Lehane, AI is now as essential as electricity, and there\u2019s an urgent need to \u201cget it right\u201d to prevent other nations from taking the lead.\n\nKey recommendations for a competitive AI ecosystem\n\nOpenAI\u2019s blueprint outlines several key steps to position the US as a global AI leader. First, the company recommends creating nationwide \u201crules of the road\u201d for AI to avoid a fragmented state-by-state approach.\n\nIt also proposes easing restrictions on the export of advanced AI models to allies and partners, enabling them to build their own ecosystems based on US technology rather than relying on Chinese models. Additionally, OpenAI suggests the formation of a consortium of AI developers to identify best practices for working with national security issues and advancing AI responsibly.\n\nBuilding AI hubs across the US\n\nAnother important recommendation is to use states as \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d to create AI hubs that focus on regional needs. For example, Kansas could develop AI applications tailored to agriculture. This approach would spread AI job opportunities and expertise across the entire country, rather than concentrating them in just a few areas.\n\nOpenAI also calls for increased federal investment in infrastructure, including energy sources and power grids, to support new data centres and AI advancements. Other suggestions include requiring AI companies to provide substantial computational resources to public universities and ensuring that AI can learn from universal, publicly available information, while still protecting creators\u2019 intellectual property.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s strategic positioning amid competition\n\nWhile Microsoft, Google, and other tech giants face significant regulatory scrutiny, OpenAI remains a young company with a focused mission: to build advanced AI. As it prepares for the incoming administration, OpenAI is eager to make the case for how its vision could benefit communities across the US, from job creation to economic investment.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s blueprint seeks to reinforce the US\u2019s ability to \u201cthink big, act big, build big,\u201d ensuring that the country maintains an edge in the global AI race. Lehane highlighted that there is currently $175 billion in global investments for AI infrastructure, and the US needs to act quickly to attract that funding before it ends up supporting Chinese-led infrastructure instead.\n\nAdvertisement"

            "article_content": "Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained\n\nThe conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people is one of the longest-running and most violent disputes in the world. Its origins go back more than a century.\n\nThere have been a series of wars between Israel and Arab nations. Uprisings - called intifadas - against Israeli occupation, and reprisals and crackdowns by Israel have also taken place.\n\nThe consequences of the historic dispute over issues including land, borders and rights are still being felt, and include the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nWhat was Israel before 1948 and how was it created?\n\nBritain took control of the area known as Palestine in World War One, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled that part of the Middle East.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAn Arab majority and a Jewish minority lived there, as well as other ethnic groups.\n\nTensions between the Jewish and Arab populations deepened when the UK agreed in principle to the establishment of a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people.\n\nJews had historical links to the land, but Palestinian Arabs also had a claim dating back centuries and opposed the move. The British said the rights of Palestinian Arabs already living there had to be protected.\n\n[Getty Images]\n\nBetween the 1920s and 1940s the number of Jews arriving grew, with many fleeing persecution in Europe. The murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust gave added urgency to demands for a safe haven.\n\nThe Jewish population reached 630,000, just over 30% of the population, by 1947.\n\nIn 1947, against a backdrop of growing violence between Jews and Arabs - and against British rule - the United Nations (UN) voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states. Jerusalem would become an international city.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNo Arab nations supported this. They argued the plan gave the Jews more of the land, even though their population was smaller.\n\nBritain abstained. It decided to withdraw and to hand the problem to the UN at the end of 14 May 1948.\n\nJewish leaders in Palestine declared an independent state known as Israel hours before British rule ended. Israel was recognised by the UN the following year.\n\nWhat was the 1948 Arab-Israeli war?\n\nThe day after Israel declared independence, it was attacked and surrounded by the armies of five Arab nations.\n\nThe conflict came to be known in Israel as its war of independence.\n\nA Haganah (Jewish Underground) fighter just before the start of the Israeli war of independence in 1948 [Getty Images]\n\nBy the time the fighting ended with an armistice in 1949, Israel controlled most of the territory.\n\nAgreements left Egypt occupying the Gaza Strip, Jordan occupying the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israel occupying West Jerusalem.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbout 750,000 Palestinians fled, or were forced from, their homes on land which became Israel and ended up as refugees.\n\nThe event is known in Arabic as the Nakba (Catastrophe).\n\nArab Legion soldiers fire on fighters of the Haganah, the Jewish Agency self-defence force, in March 1948 [Getty Images]\n\nIn the years that followed, hundreds of thousands of Jews left, or were expelled from, Muslim majority countries across the Middle East and North Africa, with many going to Israel.\n\nWhat was the 1967 Middle East war?\n\nWhat is known as the Six-Day War changed boundaries in the Middle East and had major consequences for Palestinians.\n\nThe war saw Israel fight Egypt, Syria and Jordan.\n\nIt started when Israel, fearing an attack by Egypt and Syria, launched a strike on Egypt's air force.\n\nBy the time the fighting ended, Israel had captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza from Egypt, most of the Golan Heights from Syria, and East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAbout a million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem came under Israel's control.\n\nIsraeli military commanders arrive in East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967 [Getty Images]\n\nIsrael's occupation of these areas has lasted until this day.\n\nIsrael signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and returned the Sinai.\n\nIt annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, making them part of Israel, although this has not been recognised by most of the international community.\n\nWhat is the status of the West Bank now?\n\nThe West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians.\n\nAlong with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what are widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\nThe Palestinians have always opposed Israel's presence in these areas and want them to be part of a future independent state, something backed by the vast majority of the international community.\n\nIsrael still has overall control of the West Bank, but since the 1990s, a Palestinian government - known as the Palestinian Authority - has run most of its town and cities.\n\n[BBC]\n\nThere are about 150 Israeli settlements, housing about 700,000 Jews, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nPalestinians want all Israeli settlements to be removed and they are considered illegal under international law.\n\nHowever, Israel's government disputes this. It says the biggest settlements at the very least are permanent and that all settlements are rooted in its historical rights.\n\nIt does not recognise the right of the Palestinians to have their own state and argues that the West Bank is part of the Israeli homeland.\n\nThe Israeli government announced plans to expand settlements after coming to power in 2022. It says the creation of a Palestinian state would be a threat to Israeli security.\n\nIn July 2024, the top court of the UN, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), said that Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is illegal. It said that Israel should withdraw all settlers and that it was in breach of international agreements on racism and apartheid.\n\nWhat is the dispute over Jerusalem?\n\nIsrael and the Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their capital.\n\nIsrael, which already controlled West Jerusalem, occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and later declared the entire city its permanent capital. It says Jerusalem cannot be divided.\n\nThe Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.\n\nMost of the population of East Jerusalem is Palestinian, only a small minority of whom have chosen to become Israeli citizens.\n\n[AFP]\n\nHoly sites in Jerusalem are at the centre of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The most sacred site - known to Muslims as Al Aqsa Mosque compound, or Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and to Jews as Temple Mount - lies in East Jerusalem.\n\nThe UN and most international opinion consider East Jerusalem to be Palestinian land occupied by Israel.\n\nWhat has happened in the Gaza Strip?\n\nThe Gaza Strip is a stretch of land surrounded by Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. It is 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide.\n\nHome to about 2.3 million people, it is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.\n\n[iStock]\n\nEven before the current war between Israel and Hamas, Gaza had one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. Many people were living below the poverty line and depending on food aid to survive.\n\nGaza's boundaries were drawn up as a result of the 1948 Middle East war, when it was occupied by Egypt.\n\nEgypt was driven out of Gaza in the 1967 war and the Strip was occupied by Israel, which built settlements and placed Gaza's Palestinian population under military rule.\n\nIn 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, though it retained control of its shared border, airspace and shoreline, giving it effective control of the movement of people and goods.\n\nThe UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because of the level of control Israel has.\n\nHamas won Palestinian elections in 2006, and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year.\n\nIsrael and Egypt imposed a blockade in response, with Israel controlling most of what was allowed into the territory.\n\nIn the years that followed, Hamas and Israel fought several major conflicts - including those in 2008-09, 2012 and 2014. The last major conflict between the two sides was in May 2021, which ended in a ceasefire after 11 days.\n\nEvery round of fighting has seen people killed on both sides, the vast majority of them Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nOn 7 October 2023, Hamas fighters launched an assault from Gaza, killing about 1,200 people in Israel and taking more than 250 hostages.\n\n[Getty Images]\n\nThis triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza. More than 46,000 people have been killed, the majority of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nDays before Israel marked a year since the 7 October attacks, UN humanitarian agencies signed a declaration demanding an end to \"appalling human suffering and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza\".\n\nWhich countries recognise a Palestinian state?\n\nIn May 2024, 143 out of 193 members of the United Nations' General Assembly voted in favour of a Palestinian bid for full UN membership, something that is only open to states.\n\nKnown as the State of Palestine at the UN, it has an official status of \"Permanent Observer State\", which gives it a seat but not a vote.\n\nSome European countries, along with the US, do not recognise a Palestinian state and say they will only do so as part of a long-term political solution to the conflict in the Middle East.\n\nIn the UK, MPs voted in favour of recognition in 2014, but the government has not done so. In 2021, the then Conservative government said: \"The UK will recognise a Palestinian state at a time of our choosing, and when it best serves the objective of peace.\"\n\nIsrael says it has a historical right to the West Bank and opposes an independent Palestinian state, saying it would pose an unacceptable threat.\n\nWhat about Palestinian refugees?\n\nThere are about 5.9m Palestinians registered by the UN as refugees.\n\nThey are descendants of the Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes on land which became Israel in the 1948-49 Middle East war.\n\nMost live in Jordan, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Syria and Lebanon.\n\nPalestinians insist on the right of refugees to return but Israel has refused this. It criticises the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, for allowing refugee status to be inherited by successive generations.\n\nWhat is the two-state solution?\n\nThe \"two-state solution\" is an internationally backed formula for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIt proposes an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital. It would exist alongside Israel.\n\nIsrael rejects a two-state solution. It says any final settlement must be the result of negotiations with the Palestinians, and statehood should not be a precondition.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority backs a two-state solution but Hamas does not because it is opposed to the existence of Israel.\n\nHamas says that it could accept an interim Palestinian state based on 1967 de facto borders, without officially recognising Israel, if refugees were given the right to return.\n\nEarlier efforts to settle the conflict saw Israel and Palestinian leaders sign a deal called the Oslo Peace Accords, in 1993. This was intended to provide a framework for peace talks. However, talks eventually collapsed with each side blaming the other."

            "article_content": "Putin is considering taking drastic measures to save the economy\n\nVladimir Putin is reportedly considering proposals to freeze Russian bank accounts and introduce food rationing in an attempt to prevent an economic collapse. Russians have been hit hard by rising interest rates and food inflation that has seen prices for staple items explode. Potato prices rose by almost 95% between November 2023 and 2024, while butter shot up by 36.5%. The steep increase in food has led to a spate of robberies from supermarkets and grocery stores around the country, most notably for butter.\n\nMeanwhile, interest rates stand at a record high of 21%, heaping huge pressure on companies over-leveraged on previously cheap bank loans.\n\nREAD MORE: Russia in flames as Ukraine launches devastating attacks on Putin\n\nRussia is facing a potential banking collapse\n\nThe worsening economic outlook has forced the Kremlin into considering drastic proposals to stem the crisis. Some of the measures up for consideration include preventing Russians withdrawing their deposits from banks and issuing food cards, according to the Telegram Channel General SVR. \"Many members of the Politburo agree that the freeze is necessary, but they are in no hurry to introduce this measure and are trying to postpone the adoption of the final decision as much as possible,\" the channel reported. \"On the other hand, they cannot miss the critical moment when this measure ceases to be effective and the crisis goes according to the worst scenario, the end of which will be the 'collapse of the financial system' of the country. \"We have already reported that the Russian leadership is going to block bank deposits, exchanging deposits for bank shares and prohibiting the sale of these shares for a year. \"Food cards are on the way and a decision on this issue will be made on the weekend.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nGeneral SVR emerged in 2020, claiming to be run by former and current members of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, as well as other state bodies. In a statement to Business Insider, a spokesperson declined to identify the channel's sources, citing personal security, but said they had \"complete confidence\" in them. An analysis carried out by a former Morgan Stanley investment banker has highlighted that the Russian economy could face a corporate and banking collapse with its continued military spending. Putin approved a record-breaking defence budget, setting aside 32.5 percent of the government's total spending for 2025, worth US$126 billion. Craig Kennedy said Russia has followed a two-track strategy to fund its war via its defence budget expenditures as well as an off-budget plan of similar size enabled by a law enacted on February 25, 2022, which compels Russian banks to give preferential loans to military-related businesses.\n\nTrending"

Following are HP and Dell, with Apple in fourth place with significantly lower figures.\n\nAccording to IDC, in 2024 global PC shipments reached 262.7 million units \u2014 a very modest growth of 1% compared to the previous year. All major market players, except Dell, sold more client computers than in 2023 and also increased their share at the expense of smaller manufacturers.\n\nLenovo demonstrated growth of 4.7%, HP maintained second place with 53 million PCs and growth of 0.1%. Dell shipped 39.1 million computers \u2014 2.2% less than last year. Apple sold 22.9 million Macs and showed growth of 4.5%. Asus recorded the highest growth (6.4%), with sales of 17.9 million PCs and fifth place. Total shipments of smaller manufacturers decreased by 2.1%.\n\nAmong the reasons that helped Lenovo, IDC cites Chinese government subsidies, which led to better results in the consumer segment than analysts expected. Marketing campaigns at the end of the year worldwide, as well as active portfolio updates by consumers in anticipation of the end of support for Windows 10 in October 2025 contributed to overall growth.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, total PC shipments increased by 1.8% to 68.9 million. During this period, Lenovo maintained market leadership with a share of 24.5%, from 16.9 million PCs and growth of 4.8%. HP had 19.9% and 3.7 million, showing a slight decline of 1.7%. Dell held 14.4% in the fourth quarter with unchanged other figures. Apple showed the highest growth, at 17.3% for the quarter, with an increase in shipments of 7.0 million. Asus in the quarter showed growth of 11.7% with 4.7 million, allowing the company to overtake Acer.\n\nThe forecast for the PC market in 2025 is mixed. Manufacturers have received a clear opportunity for growth in the corporate segment through support for Windows 10. However, factors of economic instability, potential tariff increases, and corresponding changes in demand complicate planning. Despite this, the industry looks at the year with cautious optimism.\n\nSource: Tom\u2019s Hardware"

            "article_content": "In this digital world, Saurabh Kumar explores the intricate dynamics of cloud-based and on-premises architectures, providing insights into how organizations can effectively navigate the evolving landscape of data infrastructure. His analysis emphasizes achieving scalability, security, and strategic balance to optimize operational efficiency and meet compliance demands.\n\nThe Shift Towards Cloud Scalability\n\nCloud computing has transformed enterprise IT by offering unparalleled scalability and flexibility. The advent of elastic computing capabilities enables organizations to adapt to fluctuating workloads seamlessly. For instance, serverless computing and dynamic scaling empower businesses to expand resources within seconds. This agility has been critical for industries with unpredictable demand surges, such as e-commerce, where transaction volumes can spike by 300% to 400% during peak seasons.\n\nRecent advancements in cloud infrastructure highlight innovations in storage durability and global content delivery. Cloud platforms now guarantee over 99.999999999% (11 nines) data durability and deliver content with minimal latency through globally distributed networks. These capabilities and consumption-based pricing models make cloud solutions attractive for businesses aiming to optimize operational efficiency and cost management.\n\nThe Resilience of On-Premises Infrastructure\n\nDespite the allure of cloud computing, on-premises infrastructure remains a vital component of modern IT strategies. On-premises solutions offer distinct advantages in latency-sensitive applications and regulatory compliance. Organizations adopting advanced software-defined infrastructure (SDI) report improved resource utilization by 45% and reduced operational costs by 38% compared to traditional setups.\n\nTechnological advancements in on-premises environments include automation and artificial intelligence integration, significantly enhancing efficiency and security. Automated infrastructure management systems reduce manual intervention by 67%, while AI-driven monitoring processes over 10,000 security events per second, addressing 89% of incidents without human input. These innovations have solidified on-premises architecture as a reliable choice for sectors prioritizing data sovereignty and control.\n\nBridging the Divide: The Hybrid Approach\n\nThe hybrid model combines cloud scalability with on-premises control, offering up to 40% cost efficiency through strategic resource allocation. It enhances resilience with redundancy and failover capabilities, ensuring consistent performance for critical applications. Businesses achieve operational efficiency by integrating dedicated networks with cloud resources while addressing compliance needs. This dual approach empowers organizations to optimize performance, enhance reliability, and maintain a competitive edge in an evolving technological landscape.\n\nSecurity and Compliance Innovations\n\nSecurity remains a cornerstone of architectural decisions. Cloud providers continue to invest in robust security frameworks, maintaining certifications like SOC 2 and ISO 27001. Shared responsibility models have proven effective, reducing security incidents by 45% with proper cloud security controls.\n\nConversely, on-premises environments enable complete control over security protocols. Organizations implementing zero-trust architectures in these setups have achieved a 73% reduction in breaches. Automated security scanning and real-time compliance monitoring further enhance the ability to meet stringent regulatory standards, making on-premises solutions indispensable for industries with high compliance demands.\n\nEconomic Considerations and Cost Optimization\n\nThe economic landscape of data architecture is evolving, with organizations carefully balancing capital and operational expenditures. Cloud solutions operate on a pay-as-you-go model, providing predictable costs aligned with resource usage. However, businesses must account for hidden costs, such as data egress fees and long-term storage expenses.\n\nOn-premises infrastructure involves significant upfront investments but offers long-term cost predictability. Organizations adopting modern infrastructure automation have reported reductions in deployment times by 84% and configuration errors by 78%. These efficiencies underscore the economic viability of on-premises systems when coupled with advanced automation.\n\nDecision Frameworks for Strategic Alignment\n\nThe success of infrastructure decisions hinges on a structured approach that aligns with organizational objectives. Comprehensive frameworks emphasizing scenario analysis and stakeholder engagement have proven effective, improving long-term outcomes by 45%. Implementing automated infrastructure solutions has further streamlined operations, reducing human errors and enhancing resource allocation by 41%.\n\nOrganizations adopting phased implementation methodologies achieve faster time-to-value while maintaining budget adherence. Regular infrastructure reviews and optimization strategies contribute to sustained performance improvements, with annual cost savings averaging 23%.\n\nIn conclusion, Saurabh Kumar emphasizes that the future of data architecture rests in the strategic integration of cloud and on-premises solutions. Embracing hybrid models enables organizations to leverage the strengths of both approaches, address their limitations, and achieve operational efficiency, cost optimization, and regulatory compliance. This balanced strategy serves as a cornerstone for sustainable digital transformation."

            "article_content": "In the evolving landscape of cloud computing, multi-tenant architecture has emerged as a pivotal framework for designing scalable and efficient Software as a Service (SaaS) applications. Shinu Pushpan, an expert in scalable cloud solutions, offers a detailed exploration of this transformative architecture, emphasizing its critical role in enabling resource sharing and ensuring data isolation. This article delves into the innovative aspects of multi-tenancy and its application in modern software systems.\n\nUnderstanding Multi-Tenancy: The Core of Modern SaaS\n\nMulti-tenancy is a software design approach in which a single application instance serves multiple customers, or \u201ctenants,\u201d while maintaining strict data and configuration separation. This paradigm balances resource sharing with tenant isolation, allowing organizations to optimize infrastructure utilization without compromising data security. Compared to traditional single-tenant models, multi-tenancy significantly reduces costs and simplifies maintenance, making it a cornerstone of modern SaaS offerings.\n\nEvolving from Single-Tenant to Multi-Tenant Systems\n\nThe evolution from single-tenant to multi-tenant systems reflects the growing demand for cost-effective and scalable software solutions. Though highly customizable, single-tenant systems require dedicated resources for each client, leading to increased operational overhead. Multi-tenancy addresses these limitations by enabling shared infrastructure while maintaining logical data separation. This shift has redefined software deployment strategies, offering businesses a robust solution for managing diverse customer needs.\n\nEnhancing Scalability with Multi-Tenancy\n\nScalability is a defining feature of multi-tenant systems. By leveraging shared resources, these architectures support rapid scaling to accommodate growing user bases. Elastic resource allocation and automated load balancing ensure consistent performance, even under high demand. This scalability reduces costs and positions organizations to meet future growth challenges effectively.\n\nKey Components of Multi-Tenant Architecture\n\nTenant Identification and Authentication: Robust authentication ensures secure resource access. Modern implementations use OAuth 2.0, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enforce tenant-specific permissions and policies.\n\nData Isolation: Multi-tenancy employs data partitioning strategies, such as separate or shared schemas with tenant identifiers, to maintain strict boundaries. These approaches ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance.\n\nResource Management\n\n\n\nDynamic resource allocation across tenants is crucial for efficiency. Advanced systems use machine learning algorithms for predictive scaling, ensuring fair distribution and maintaining performance during peak loads.\n\nSecurity and data privacy are paramount in multi-tenant environments. Advanced security frameworks implement zero-trust models, tenant-aware authentication, and cross-tenant isolation mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access. Data privacy measures, including compliance with GDPR and CCPA, further enhance trust and reliability in these systems. Immutable audit logs and real-time threat detection protect against potential breaches.\n\nPerformance Optimization Strategies\n\nIntelligent caching, efficient query optimization, and predictive analytics drive performance optimization in multi-tenant systems. Distributed caching mechanisms prevent resource contention and ensure high availability, while advanced query optimization techniques enable fast, reliable data access tailored to tenant-specific needs. Predictive analytics further enhances performance by proactively identifying potential bottlenecks and optimizing resource allocation. These combined strategies reduce latency and improve system responsiveness and overall user experience. By delivering consistent, high-quality performance, multi-tenancy solidifies its position as the preferred architecture for scalable and high-performance SaaS applications in competitive digital markets.\n\nFuture of Multi-Tenant Architectures\n\nThe future of multi-tenant systems lies in the integration of cloud-native technologies and artificial intelligence, paving the way for unprecedented scalability and innovation. Advancements in predictive scaling, automated management, real-time analytics, and intelligent monitoring will further enhance efficiency, adaptability, and proactive resource optimization. As businesses increasingly adopt SaaS models to drive digital transformation, multi-tenancy will remain central to addressing evolving customer demands, supporting global scalability, and enabling seamless collaboration. This architectural approach ensures organizations can effectively meet the needs of an increasingly interconnected and dynamic digital economy, positioning themselves for long-term success and resilience.\n\nIn conclusion, Shinu Pushpan\u2019s analysis underscores the transformative potential of multi-tenant architecture in shaping modern SaaS applications. By enabling resource efficiency, robust security, and seamless scalability, multi-tenancy provides a solid foundation for addressing complex business requirements. As organizations navigate the challenges of a rapidly evolving technological landscape, adopting multi-tenant systems will be crucial for achieving sustainable growth and operational excellence. This forward-thinking architectural approach not only meets current demands but also equips businesses to adapt and thrive in the future of cloud computing."

            "article_content": "A humungous beast of an animal was discovered in the Amazon rainforest in early 2024, leaving the explorer that found it in awe.\n\nDescribed as being 'as thick as a car tire', the creature was discovered by scientist Professor Freek Vonk among others, who revealed that the animal weighed over 200 kilograms.\n\nAs seen in the viral video, the creature is actually the largest snake in the world, and it was found in the Amazon rainforest (no shock there).\n\nAdvert\n\nIf you're wondering exactly how big it is, look no further:\n\nThe colossal snake wowed thousands on social media, after the professor shared his jaw-dropping discovery with his Instagram followers.\n\nProfessor Vonk highlighted during the video that it was one of the largest snakes he'd ever seen in his life, describing it as 'massive' and a 'monster'.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe also claimed that the new species means that the largest snake species in the world does not only have one variation.\n\nThe scientist explained: \u201cTogether with 14 other scientists from nine countries I have described a NEW snake species from the Amazon today. And not just one. A massive snake!\n\n\"We\u2019ve discovered that the largest snake species in the world, the green anaconda - as we all know it from the movies and all the stories about giant snakes - actually consists of two different species!\n\n\u201cThe green anacondas that occur in the northern part of their range in South America (including Venezuela, Suriname, and French Guyana) turn out to be a completely different species!\n\nAdvert\n\n\"Even though they look almost identical to the eye, the genetic difference between the two is 5.5%, and that is huge.\n\n\"To put this in perspective: humans and chimps are genetically different only about 2% from each other.\u201d\n\nThe professor couldn't believe that the discovered species was part of the largest in the world (Instagram/@freekvonk)\n\nVonk continued: \u201cThe biggest anaconda I've ever seen can be seen in the video, as thick as a car tire, eight meters long and over 200 kg heavy - with a head as big as my head. From total awe and admiration a 'monster'!\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve discovered a new species before, but that was a small snake from Australia. Now it's about a mythical and legendary animal!\n\n\"Definitely one of the highlights of my scientific career. Also because this snake can be found in the Amazon, a place that feels like home to me.\u201d\n\nThe Dutch Professor, who is also a TV presenter, used the discovery to highlight the impact of climate change on the area that it was found, saying that it was \u2018heavily under pressure from climate change and the ever-lasting deforestation of primary rainforest\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u201cAlready over a fifth of the Amazon has disappeared, that's more than 30x the area of the Netherlands.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cThe survival of these iconic giant snakes is inseparable to protecting their natural habitat. This study highlights how efficient we need to be on our largest tropical rainforest in the world.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Descendants of Jack the Ripper's victims have demanded an inquest following the discovery of new DNA evidence which could finally unmask the sadistic killer.\n\nThe case of Jack the Ripper is one of the most infamous and enduring cases in British crime history, seeing at least five women - Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly - brutally murdered in East London between 1888 and 1891.\n\nDespite numerous theories cropping up over the years, Jack's true identity has never been uncovered. However, new evidence could finally solve the case once and for all.\n\nAdvert\n\nRead More: Man who claims to have identified Jack the Ripper explains why he was never caught\n\nA depiction of what Jack the Ripper could have looked like (Russell Edwards)\n\nThe supposed breakthrough came after author Russell Edwards purchased a shawl found at the scene of Eddowes' murder containing blood and semen stains and put the item through DNA testing, but this process has since been disputed by scientists.\n\nEdwards was then able to find a DNA match to a descendant of Eddowes, as well as claiming he'd used the semen to find a distant match for a relative of barber Aaron Kosminski, one of the most prominent Ripper suspects.\n\nAdvert\n\nHe has since published the findings from his investigation in his book Naming Jack the Ripper: The Definitive Reveal, which outlines his arguments for Kosminski being the killer's true identity.\n\nKosminski was a Polish barber who emigrated to London in the 1880s and had been named as a suspect at the time but was never arrested due to lack of evidence. He would later die at Leavesden Hospital (then an asylum) in 1919.\n\nAccording to MailOnline, the latest update in the case has seen Edwards hire a legal team to press for an inquest into the case, which is backed by the descendant of Kosminski and Karen Miller, the three-times great-granddaughter of Eddowes.\n\nKaren Miller, a descendant of Ripper victim Catherine Eddowes (North News & Pictures)\n\nAdvert\n\nExplaining her reasons for backing the calls for an inquest, Miller said she wanted to see justice for the five women.\n\n\"What about the real name of the person who did this? Having the real person legally named in a court which can consider all the evidence would be a form of justice for the victims,\" she said.\n\n\"We have got the proof, now we need this inquest to legally name the killer.\n\n\"It would mean a lot to me, to my family, to a lot of people to finally have this crime solved.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThe sentiment is shared by Sue Parlour, whose husband is distantly related to Nichols and Amanda Poulos, the three-times great-niece of Kosminski.\n\n\"A second inquest is the only way of confirming what happened,\" Edwards added.\n\n\"As we now have identified the true murderer with a wealth of evidence putting the man we named as the Ripper in the frame, we want justice to be served.\""

However, this natural marvel owes its unique shape to erosion rather than human or alien intervention.\n\nA Natural Pyramid Among Antarctic Peaks\n\nThe unnamed mountain, standing about 4,150 feet tall, lies in the southern Ellsworth Mountains. Its striking pyramid-like form first gained attention in 2016 when images went viral online. Located near the Patriot Hills, where climate scientists often work, this mountain has likely been known to researchers for years, according to Mauri Pelto, an environmental science professor at Nichols College.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nDiscovered during a 1935 flight by American aviator Lincoln Ellsworth, the Ellsworth Mountains are home to jagged peaks and ancient geological history. This region contains fossils of Cambrian-era creatures dating back over 500 million years, adding to its allure.\n\nRead Also: Scientists reveal secrets of sharks' sex lives by examining their bloody mating bite marks\n\nHow Nature Shaped the Pyramid\n\nScientists attribute the mountain\u2019s unique form to freeze-thaw erosion, a natural process where water enters rock cracks during the day, freezes at night, and expands. Over millions of years, this process widened cracks and broke off large rock sections, sculpting the mountain into its current shape.\n\nWhile three sides eroded uniformly, the fourth side \u2014 the eastern ridge \u2014 developed separately. This process has also shaped other pyramidal peaks, like the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps, said Pelto.\n\nRead Also: '1.27 million light-years long': Astronomers spot a new ultra-diffuse galaxy forming in Leo constellation; see image\n\nDebunking Conspiracy Theories\n\nThe mountain's striking appearance has fueled conspiracy theories about ancient civilizations or extraterrestrial influence. However, experts, including Eric Rignot, an Earth system science professor at the University of California, Irvine, dismiss such claims. \"Pyramid shapes are not unusual; many peaks resemble pyramids,\" Rignot explained.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nUltimately, this Antarctic wonder remains a testament to the power of nature and the intrigue of our planet\u2019s hidden corners."

Many items such as safety glass (1903) taken for granted in today\u2019s windscreens but one of earliest uses was in gasmasks, for troops in WWI. Vaseline (1870) an accidental find, when \u2018gunk on pipes\u2019 was used by troops as a staple; to sooth burns, wounds and trench foot.\n\nSimple items, such as matches (1826), are taken for granted. Superseded by lighters, they play a part in history. Even 25 years after the war, men lighting cigarettes would only light one, then another, before putting the match out and starting again. This habit was engrained because during the war a sniper could use a bullet to \u2018home in\u2019 and take out the third light.\n\nCoco-Cola (1826) yet another derivative from \u2018war\u2019 when its American inventor, following his experience in American Civil War, wanted to create an opiate free drink, to alleviate his addiction to morphine. Unfortunately, caffeine and stimulants still included, offended the Temperance Movement insisting it be alcohol free so, changes resulted in a sugar syrup concoction of carbonated water. Dynamite (1847) invented by a lab chemist, very wary of progressing development when conscious it was more powerful than gunpowder, yet more volatile. However not deterred, his colleague, saw the potential in mining, demolition and armament for war. Play-Doh\u2019s inventor nearly went bankrupt, when changes in society changed his customer base.\n\nPre 1942 homes heated with coal, left sooty deposits on walls and this was used as a cleaning product, until post war electric and gas meant soot was less of an issue. Bankruptcy was only avoided because the inventor\u2019s sister took it into a primary school, to use as modelling clay, initially called Rainbow Craft, before developing the product we know today.\n\nAccidents continue; Cornflakes as a healthy veg option, developed when boiled wheat left to go soggy was put in an oven to crisp up. The initial microwave (1967) was 5 ft tall, weighing 750lbs yet; few homes are now without one. Similarly, the most common used antibiotic in the world Penicillin, developed by accident after its inventor left a messy worktop, which became mouldy.\n\nAnother invention, much taken for granted; smoke detectors save millions of lives because, in fires smoke kills. Potato chips unbelievably resulted when a disgruntled customer complained about the thickness of his fries. The annoyed chef sliced potatoes using a mandolin to irritate him but unexpectedly another \u2018product\u2019 became an everyday one. Concluding, Viagra developed medically for Angina; like every other product highlighted, has other uses and made billions of dollars - by accident!\n\nAnne concluded with Chairman\u2019s Cheer and Thought for the Day; \u201cEvery day may not be good but there is something good in every day.\u201d\n\nRetired or Semi-Retired, professional or business ladies meet on the first Thursday each month at Chase Golf Club, 12 noon, to share meal, fellowship and speakers with outings and other activities. New members are welcome: Annual membership \u00a316 and two course lunch \u00a322. Further information contact: Membership Secretary, Barbara on 01889 882166 or Chairman Anne 01922 418037."

            "article_content": "Read time: 6 minutes\n\nBatteries, solar panels, computer chips, carbon capture systems. All these innovative technologies, and others like them, are the result of serious breakthroughs in materials science \u2013 driven by the discovery and synthesis of novel inorganic materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, the discovery of new inorganic materials with more favorable properties was a daunting task of trial and error, with scientists forced to conduct hundreds upon hundreds of hours of painstaking experimentation to identify and synthesize just a handful of potential new materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational chemistry was a revolution in the world of materials science when it was first introduced. With the increased availability of supercomputers and the combined efforts of physicists, chemists and computer scientists, researchers could simulate the behavior of molecules and materials at the atomic scale. This helped scientists to accurately predict the properties of new materials without the need for such repetitive physical experimentation, shedding a significant amount of the \u201ctrial and error\u201d baggage.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, with the advent of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a sense that another materials revolution could be on the way, with AI-guided materials discovery set to accelerate these computational approaches even further.\n\nBetter materials for tackling the climate crisis\n\n\u201cLet me just say that I am not a material scientist, I am a theoretical physicist,\u201d Dr. Eliu A. Huerta began our conversation. Huerta is the lead for translational AI in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory, US, and has been working at the intersection of AI and scientific research for a decade already. Under his guidance, researchers at Argonne have been applying AI and advanced computational techniques to tackle grand challenges in astrophysics, cosmology, materials science and biophysics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne thing I learned when I was being trained as a theoretical physicist is the value of being an outsider. You look at things in a completely different way and this allows you to propose new ideas,\u201d Huerta told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cI am really excited about solving problems that AI alone cannot solve, that domain knowledge alone cannot solve, that supercomputing alone cannot solve \u2014 but where a mix of all of these can provide new approaches and new opportunities to understand science in a way you couldn\u2019t do with these separate tools,\u201d said Huerta.\n\nHuerta recently helped lead a project that sought to design new materials for carbon capture. Specifically, the group was interested in a class of compounds known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are highly porous materials, made up of metal ion clusters and organic ligands which function as the network\u2019s nodes and linkers respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished in Communications Chemistry, the researchers used a generative AI diffusion model to suggest unique and chemically diverse linkers that could be used to make novel MOFs. These were screened using a modified neural network that would select the MOFs with the best theoretical carbon capture performance. The final structures were then validated using traditional computational chemistry methods, including molecular dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, to compute more credible CO 2 absorption capabilities and make the final selection of best performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTypically, when you do computational chemistry, you know the structure that you want to validate. You know that the molecule already exists and you want to go and measure some properties. But we were interested in doing this and borrowing ideas from drug design and discovery,\u201d Huerta explained. \u201cSo here we use the diffusion model, which is a generative AI model, and we expose that model to different molecular structures so that the model would learn not only about metal-organic frameworks, but about physics broadly speaking. I think this was the key to allowing the model to propose some chemical structures that were entirely novel.\"\n\nThe strength of this kind of approach is its speed, Huerta continued. Creating new MOFs has been the focus of researchers for several decades, yet the number of exceptionally high-performing MOF materials is still relatively low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cExperimental science is needed, but it maybe is not the optimal way to go and discover new materials,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThen again, if you are only using computational chemistry methods, it is very challenging to create a new material from the ground up! Now, with the method that we are proposing, we are learning from experimental chemistry and computational chemistry, but we are allowing AI to go and explore this vast chemical design space and find new things that we did not know about in the past.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the study, Huerta\u2019s team was able to generate over 120,000 MOF candidates in 33 minutes using a supercomputer at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. This was whittled down by the modified neural network to 364 AI-generated MOFs that were believed to be high-performing. In total, this process took just over five hours. Further computational analysis, which took only a few days to complete, found 102 stable MOFs in this dataset, of which 6 had a CO 2 capacity that ranked in the top 5% of materials in the popular hMOF database.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the team\u2019s tool having found success in suggesting novel, high-performance carbon capture materials, Huerta believes that similar workflows with altered parameters could help with accelerating the design of advanced materials for other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you have these tools, you want to develop the ability to go and tackle similar problems that you can apply MOFs in, for example, hydrogen storage. This is just another parameter that you can use to fine-tune your generative AI model. Going beyond this, there is also methane capture, with methane being another gas that is responsible for environmental pollution,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThere are many applications where we can use this software to go and explore the properties of new materials.\u201d\n\nImproving batteries with AI-generated materials\n\nMachine learning and generative AI are useful for more than just MOFs. As tools, they can be applied in a similar way to accelerate the design and discovery of other classes of material for different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEach generation faces a defining technical challenge, and for ours, that challenge is climate change. It\u2019s urgent and requires immediate action,\u201d Dr. Austin Sendek, an adjunct professor of materials science & engineering at Stanford University, told Technology Networks.\n\n\u201cAI has the potential to accelerate fundamental scientific processes. My focus on energy technologies is driven by both this scientific potential and the broader global impact of solving this issue,\u201d Sendek said.\n\nAt Stanford, Sendek\u2019s research focuses on harnessing the power of machine learning and AI to design new materials that can support the decarbonization of the global economy. The main focus of this research is on batteries and electrochemistry \u2013 using machine learning to assist in the discovery of better electrolytes to support high-performance batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrochemistry offers a new modality through which we can achieve many of the same outcomes as burning fuels, but by using clean, renewable electrons instead,\u201d Sendek explained. \u201cWhile powering vehicles through electricity via batteries is a major application, the scope of next-generation electrochemistry extends to areas like cement production, grid power backup and the creation of various materials, for instance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe search for new and improved battery materials and electrolytes is a core part of the decarbonization effort. Higher-performance batteries can help store more energy from the grid when renewable energy production is high, meaning that more green energy can still be released even when production is low. Battery improvements could also lead to better electric vehicles with larger ranges or faster charging times \u2013 again helping to support the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 2018 paper, published in the journal Chemistry of Materials, Sendek and co-authors demonstrated the use of a machine learning-based prediction model to generate novel lithium ion conductors for use in all-solid-state batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cElectrolyte components heavily impact the performance and properties of these cells,\u201d Sendek noted. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast chemical space to explore, with over 10 billion commercially available molecules that can be used to modify electrolytes in various ways.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team found that this machine learning-assisted approach was 2.7 times more likely to identify fast lithium conductors than a random search, in addition to performing well in a head-to-head competition against six PhD students with experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a review published in Advanced Energy Materials, Sendek and his colleagues also highlight the ability of machine learning-based approaches to assist in other areas, such as process optimization, cell lifetime prediction and battery modeling, in addition to accelerating materials discovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further explain why AI and machine learning are such helpful tools, Sendek strips it back to a matter of depth and breadth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the depth side, AI and machine learning help us identify patterns and relationships that would typically require scientific intuition and principles to uncover. For example, it can reveal how different electrolytes affect battery performance or predict the properties of new materials \u2014 tasks that, in the past, might have taken years of experimentation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the breadth side, once we develop predictive models, machine learning allows us to apply them to a much larger design space at incredible speeds. These models can rapidly evaluate vast numbers of molecules, often identifying potential candidates that would have taken traditional scientific methods much longer to find.\u201d\n\nThe future outlook for materials and AI\n\nAI and machine learning are quickly solidifying themselves as novel, useful tools in many areas of science \u2013 including medicine, proteomics, drug discovery and more. In materials science, the benefit of these tools is their speed. With today\u2019s computing power, these tools can generate realistic novel materials at a blistering pace, freeing scientists from extensive loops of \u201ctrial and error\u201d and allowing them to put their expertise to better use further down the development process. In the context of the global climate crisis, the search for innovative new materials for carbon capture and green energy storage cannot happen quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the application of AI and machine learning to materials science is still a relatively nascent field, with several limitations needing to be addressed as the field develops. For example, much of AI\u2019s use in materials discovery and design relies on the use of pre-built datasets, therefore it is key that these datasets are properly assessed to ensure their reliability and quality.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials scientists have also begun to discuss the various ethical considerations that may come with incorporating AI into their work. This includes the importance of recognizing and mitigating any bias in an AI model\u2019s training data, as well as remaining vigilant in recognizing AI-generated misinformation through the application of rigorous validation practices."
