            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nVideo and images of an orb-shaped UFO allegedly taken by a co-pilot on a runway at Manchester Airport in Great Britain have led to many unanswered questions. The sighting reportedly occurred this past June, but was just shared last week. However, the person who originally shared the material has disappeared from the internet.\n\nThe anonymous source, who went by the pseudonym \u201cCaptainBiggalow\u201d on X (Twitter), claimed to be an airline pilot who received the video and images from a colleague. He also claimed that after the UFO sighting, airport security was dispatched to investigate the UFO sighting.\n\n\u201cHowever, he said, seemingly upon realizing it had been spotted, the object departed the scene with a sudden vertical ascent,\u201d reporter Tim Binnall of Coast to Coast AM wrote. \u201cAdding another layer of mystery to the curious case, the CaptainBiggalow account shut down shortly after the post caught the attention of UFO enthusiasts online and spawned a dizzying amount of discussion on Reddit.\u201d\n\nOver on Reddit, in the post discussing the strange UFO sighting, someone explained, \u201cOP deleted his account on X and Reddit. I assume probably got some hate from somewhere. It\u2019s a shame this is the world we live in. Luckily u/Own-Resolution-8476 made contact and got the OP\u2019s original files, and made an X post as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpoke to @captainbiggalow & got photos they received from their colleges at Manchester airport,\u201d that person wrote on X. \u201cNo metadata could be recovered, ELA good. Timeline clarified, object seen on ground (1) (2), reported to tower, ops vehicle investigates (3), orb shoots up and video taken (4).\u201d\n\nSpoke to @captainbiggalow & got photos they received from their colleges at Manchester airport. No metadata could be recovered, ELA good. Timeline clarified, object seen on ground (1) (2), reported to tower, ops vehicle investigates (3), orb shoots up and video taken (4). pic.twitter.com/HqRlsf10Cq \u2014 PNW MPA (@PNWMPA) November 27, 2024\n\nThe original source of the images and video also wrote before deleting their Reddit account, \u201cHello everyone. The link to this thread was posted on the X thread. I thought I\u2019d join in the conversation to clarify some points of discussion.\n\n\u201cFirstly my name is not Biggalow. I wont be revealing my true identity because I would like to remain anonymous. The last thing I want is my name or the first officers plastered all over the internet for the world to see. Please be respectful that we are professionals and like to keep our heads down and our noses clean. If the meta data reveals any personal details please do not post them.\n\n\u201cThat being said I created the x account to share the photos video with the world as I believe they need to be seen. I have been an airline pilot for a UK operator for several decades and we know what is normal and what isn\u2019t. The photos and video were taken by a colleague and as such I can only relay what was told to me. But rest assured we know what we are looking at in the skies. This is not a balloon or a drone and has been a hot topic of conversation in our community for quite a while.\u201d\n\nWhat is it? And is it real? We may never know. But we do know that during the first public briefing held by a NASA group that was formed to study UFOs reported a large number of unexplained metallic orbs have been spotted at high altitudes around the world.\n\n\u201cThis is a typical example of the thing that we see most of. We see these all over the world and we see these making very interesting apparent maneuvers,\u201d said Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, then the director of the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO)."

Villagers had heard strange cries coming from a nearby forest, but mistook them for ghostly sounds, according to Thai media reports. It wasn't until police dispatched rescue personnel to the forest that they heard a voice responding to their calls. The crew located the source of the voice and found 22-year-old Liu Chuanyi at the bottom of a 12-metre-deep well, Independent reported. The rescue operation lasted 30 minutes.\n\nMr Chuanyi was found in a weakened state and had sustained serious injuries, including a fractured wrist, cerebral concussion, and bruises, after being trapped without food or water for three days and nights. He was rescued and taken to the hospital for medical attention.\n\nAccording to Mr Chuanyi, he strategically shouted for help once every hour, conserving his energy during his three-day ordeal. Meanwhile, nearby villagers reported hearing strange cries, which they attributed to paranormal activity. As a result, they avoided venturing outside after dark and didn't investigate the noise further.\n\nAuthorities believe that Mr. Liu accidentally fell into the well while attempting to navigate his way out of the forest. The circumstances surrounding Mr Liu's presence at the Thailand-Myanmar border remain a mystery, and authorities have reached out to the immigration department to investigate how he ended up in the area. In the meantime, local authorities are taking proactive measures to prevent similar incidents by sealing the well with a cover, ensuring the area is safer for everyone.\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread attention on Chinese social media, with many users sharing and discussing the harrowing story.\n\nOne user wrote, \"A Chinese man shouting for help in the middle of nowhere? Of course, the locals can't understand the language and might think it was a wizard uttering spells.\"\n\nAnother commented, \"Kudos to his strength and stamina. Struggling for three days and nights but still yelling; this guy is truly impressive.\""

            "article_content": "A few years ago, my husband and I visited New Orleans for the first time in December. This trip was so memorable that New Orleans became one of my favorite cities in the US. There\u2019s something alluring about its history, supernatural lore, music, and food. Combine all this with Christmas lights, R\u00e9veillon multi-course holiday dinners, and cooler weather; December is the best time to visit.\n\nYou can\u2019t beat the weather\n\nAshlee eating Rockefeller oysters at Gallier\u2019s / Roosevelt Hotel lobby\n\nWe arrived at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. The airport was smaller than I imagined and easy to navigate. Rolling our carry-ons, we followed the signs toward the rideshares. Once we stepped outside the terminal, a cool but humid breeze hit my skin, and I was surprised. I thought it would be warmer outside.\n\nThis is when I learned that you can\u2019t beat the cooler weather this time of year in the South along the Gulf. It is typically in the mid-40s to mid-60s degrees Fahrenheit, which is pleasant for walking around and sightseeing \u2013 just don\u2019t forget to pack warm layers.\n\nStay at a historic hotel in the French Quarter\n\nHotel Monteleone\n\nOur rideshare navigated the bustling roadways of the city as I admired the sights and sounds from the car window. The driver dropped us off in front of the Hotel Monteleone.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nI\u2019m a fan of the paranormal and had heard that this hotel was one of the most haunted places in the US, so that is why I booked our stay here. Before you keep reading, I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 how romantic of me. I didn\u2019t tell my husband this spooky detail in advance. I just told him it was a beautiful historic hotel. For the record, nothing ghostly happened during our stay.\n\nWe walked inside and were immediately in awe of the dazzling Christmas lights. The lobby was magnificently decorated. We checked in, dropped our luggage off in our room, freshened up, and put on our dinner outfits. We went downstairs to try and grab a seat at the famous Carousel Bar. This bar rotates like a carousel and is an iconic city attraction.\n\nSadly, the bar was packed, so we didn\u2019t have a cocktail there. Instead, we headed out on the town to see more Christmas lights before dinner.\n\nTop spots to see holiday sparkles\n\nWe walked over to the Roosevelt to see the holiday lights and grab a cocktail. It was incredible. Then we returned to the Hotel Monteleone for dinner at the Criollo Restaurant. Criollo was one of our favorite places to eat during this trip. We treated ourselves to their R\u00e9veillon multi-course holiday meal.\n\nIn December, the Hotel Monteleone, the Roosevelt Hotel, the Windsor Court, the Royal Sonesta, the Ritz Carlton, the Bourbon Orleans, and La Pavillon all spectacularly decorate their lobbies for Christmas.\n\nGorge on beignets and explore the French Quarter\n\nSt. Louis Cathedral New Orleans\n\nWe\u2019d heard Caf\u00e9 du Monde was the best breakfast place, so we kicked our second day off walking there. My husband ordered the famous beignets, and I grabbed a coffee. He wholeheartedly enjoyed their fluffy beignets covered in powdered sugar.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nCaf\u00e9 du Monde is across the street from Jackson Square. You can walk over there and see the St. Louis Cathedral.\n\nAfterward, we wandered around Woldenberg Riverfront Park. It was a cloudy and misty day when we visited, but I loved exploring the square and seeing the Mississippi River along the riverfront park.\n\nGet lost roaming around Bourbon Street\n\nNew Orleans French Quarter\n\nI\u2019ve always been interested in magic, so we headed towards Bourbon Street to visit the Voodoo Museum. It is located between Bourbon and Royal Street. The museum was darker than expected, but I found it fascinating.\n\nThere are more Voodoo shops in the area, too. Yes, I bought a Voodoo doll (also called a Gris Gris doll), and contrary to what I have seen on TV, they can bring good luck and protection \u2014 depending on the magic spell.\n\nWhen you\u2019re hungry from walking around town and window shopping, have lunch at Maspero's. It\u2019s known for its authentic NOLA vibes and is an affordable spot to grab a bite.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nWe wrapped up the day enjoying dinner at Brennan\u2019s. I was tickled when I saw their building was pink. This upscale restaurant is famous for its Creole food, and December is one of the best times to eat here \u2013 they serve R\u00e9veillon specials (at least they did the year we visited). If you didn\u2019t make early reservations, see if your hotel concierge can help.\n\nHave a transformative psychic reading\n\nNew Orleans bridge\n\nI had always wanted to do a psychic reading, and I knew New Orleans was famous for this kind of activity. So I Googled \u201cthe best psychics in New Orleans,\u201d and Cari Roy popped up . I emailed to make an appointment.\n\nOn the third day of our trip, her assistant miraculously managed to squeeze me into the schedule at the last minute (Cari Roy books months in advance). I was ecstatic.\n\nPsychic readings are very personal, and Cari Roy was welcoming, kind, and surprisingly spot-on. I\u2019ll never forget the experience. It was enlightening.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter the reading, we grabbed dinner at Gallier\u2019s Restaurant and Oyster Bar . It\u2019s just down the street from Cari Roy\u2019s office. High on life after my first psychic reading, we splurged on Rockefeller oysters and sparkling wine. The oysters were amazing.\n\nStep into the soul of New Orleans\n\nThe Spotted Cat Club\n\nOn our last night, we caught a taxi to Frenchmen Street to visit a few jazz clubs. Some of the bars required covers, and others did not. We were on a mission to check out the Spotted Cat before calling it a night. It\u2019s one of the most famous jazz clubs in the city.\n\nOther things to do while visiting\n\nCanal Street streetcar\n\nIf you have more time to spend in New Orleans, or if this is your second or third trip here, people love going on ghost tours , seeing the famous cemeteries, and visiting the National WWII Museum .\n\nYou can also shop on Royal Street, look for antiques on Magazine Street, or take the streetcar ."

However, new research is casting serious doubt on this theory, suggesting that the planet\u2019s surface never hosted the essential ingredient for life\u2014liquid water.This ground-breaking study, published in Nature Astronomy, comes from a team of researchers at the University of Cambridge. By analysing Venus\u2019s atmospheric chemistry and volcanic gases, the team concluded that Venus\u2019s interior is far too dry to have ever supplied enough water to form oceans, dismissing the idea that the planet could have once harboured life.The latest research into Venus\u2019s atmosphere and volcanic gases has shattered the long-standing theory that the planet could have once supported life. With Venus\u2019s surface likely never having hosted liquid water, the search for life in our solar system and beyond is being refocused on planets that are more Earth-like in their composition and environmental conditions. As we await further findings from future missions like NASA \u2019s DAVINCI, this new understanding of Venus challenges our notions of what makes a planet habitable and urges us to look elsewhere in the universe for signs of life.Today, Venus is a hellish world characterised by surface temperatures reaching around 1,000\u00b0F (500\u00b0C), which is hot enough to melt lead. The planet\u2019s atmosphere is composed of clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a nearly impossible environment for life as we know it. For years, scientists speculated that Venus might have been cooler billions of years ago, possibly allowing for liquid water to exist on its surface. However, the latest research challenges this idea, suggesting that Venus was \u201cborn hot\u201d and may have never had the conditions required for water to exist in a liquid state.This research holds particular significance, not just for understanding Venus\u2019s past, but also for the study of exoplanets\u2014planets orbiting stars beyond our solar system. If Venus was never habitable, it could imply that Venus-like planets elsewhere in the universe are also less likely to support life.The Cambridge research team, led by PhD student Tereza Constantinou, examined Venus\u2019s atmospheric chemistry, particularly the destruction of key chemicals like water vapor, carbon dioxide, and carbonyl sulfide. They found that the lack of water vapor in Venus's volcanic eruptions was a crucial clue. On Earth, volcanic eruptions release a significant amount of water vapor due to our water-rich interior. However, Venus's volcanic gases contain no more than 6% water vapor, suggesting the planet\u2019s interior has never been wet enough to support oceans.This dry volcanic activity led the researchers to conclude that Venus's surface was never able to hold enough water to form oceans, a key requirement for life to thrive.The discovery has profound implications for the search for life beyond our solar system. Exoplanets, or planets that orbit other stars, come in many varieties, some of which are similar in size and temperature to Venus. If Venus was never habitable, it suggests that planets like Venus might not be ideal candidates for harbouring life, either.The research could also help refine our understanding of how planets evolve and where we should focus our search for life elsewhere in the universe. While scientists are eagerly awaiting NASA's upcoming DAVINCI mission, set to launch in 2029, which will send a probe to Venus to gather more data, this new finding already points to a need to focus on planets that are more likely to have liquid water, such as Earth-like exoplanets in the habitable zone.There are two primary theories about Venus\u2019s past and how it may have evolved. The first theory suggests that Venus could have once been cool enough to harbor liquid water. Over time, volcanic activity and a runaway greenhouse effect could have gradually raised the planet\u2019s temperature to the extreme levels we see today.The second theory, which the new research supports, proposes that Venus was \"born hot\" and never had the necessary conditions to sustain liquid water. This theory suggests that Venus was always a hostile world, incapable of supporting life, even in its distant past.Constantinou explains that the team\u2019s research is based on current observations of Venus\u2019s atmosphere, rather than relying solely on climate models. They looked at how quickly water and other chemicals are removed from the atmosphere and replenished by volcanic eruptions. This allowed them to infer that Venus\u2019s interior, unlike Earth\u2019s, has always been too dry to have ever hosted oceans.While this new revelation may disappoint those hoping that Venus once supported life, it serves as a valuable lesson for astronomers in the search for habitable planets. If Venus, despite its Earth-like size and proximity to the Sun, was never habitable, then scientists may need to focus their efforts on finding exoplanets with conditions more similar to Earth\u2019s.Constantinou notes, \"Even though it\u2019s the closest planet to us, Venus is important for exoplanet science because it gives us a unique opportunity to explore a planet that evolved very differently to ours, right at the edge of the habitable zone.\" The discovery also highlights the need to be more selective in the search for life, with astronomers now considering factors such as volcanic activity and atmospheric chemistry as important clues in identifying planets that could support life.The discovery of Venus\u2019s inhospitable past does not mark the end of exploration, however. NASA's DAVINCI mission, which is expected to launch in June 2029, will provide new insights into Venus's atmosphere and surface conditions. The mission will send a probe into the planet's thick atmosphere, collecting vital data that could help answer the ultimate question: Could Venus have ever supported life?While the probe is not designed to survive the harsh conditions on Venus\u2019s surface, it may provide a fleeting glimpse of the planet\u2019s surface, adding more pieces to the puzzle of Venus\u2019s past."

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"
