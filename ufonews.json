            "article_content": "Nature\u2019s connections can show up in the most unassuming places. For decades, people have watched curiously as ants collect seeds. These seeds often come with a fatty attachment that entices ants to take them underground, which is a nifty tactic employed by plants to get their seeds dispersed.\n\nThis strategy, known as myrmecochory, has guided ecological thinking for many years. Recent observations have shaken up this old concept, as a surprising twist has come from an unlikely source: oak galls produced by certain wasps.\n\nAnts and wasps\n\nEight-year-old Hugo noticed something puzzling one afternoon. He saw a small parade of ants scurrying across a path, hauling what he assumed were regular seeds.\n\nHis father, named Andrew Deans, took a closer look and realized these were oak galls, not plant seeds.\n\nGalls are growths shaped by wasps to ensure a safe shelter in which their larvae can develop. Hugo\u2019s discovery launched fresh inquiries into how wasps might be tricking ants into unwittingly providing protection and resources for their developing young.\n\nAndrew Deans is a professor of entomology at Penn State. His experiences with insect classification and ecology helped shape the next steps in understanding how certain wasps manipulate ant behavior.\n\nWorking with other researchers, he looked at the structure and chemical makeup of the oak galls, aiming to see whether these odd lumps mimic the enticing attachments found on seeds.\n\nThat line of inquiry opened the door to a bigger story about insect collaboration.\n\nThe lure of fatty acids\n\nResearch into seed dispersal has shown that ants love fatty acids, which they harvest from specialized structures on seeds.\n\nMany oak galls have a similar coating, sometimes called a hood, that contains these appealing molecules.\n\nOnce ants bring the gall inside their nest, they devour the fatty portion but leave the rest. Within that intact shell, the wasp larvae stay hidden from predators.\n\nThe parallels between seeds and galls have stirred fresh debate among entomologists.\n\nChemical camouflage\n\nThe biggest revelation for many scientists is that these gall hoods may imitate the scent of deceased insects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how these structures mimic the chemical profile of dead insects, one of the main food sources for ants,\u201d said John Tooker, professor of entomology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThis discovery sheds light on a possible reason behind the ants\u2019 brisk retrieval of galls. They are likely to think they have found a reliable meal, but end up giving wasp larvae a free ride and shelter instead.\n\nAnts, wasps, and evolution\n\nMillions of years before humans paid attention to them, galls were a feature on oak trees. Fossil records show that wasps and oaks have had a long relationship, although it is not clear when ants became part of the mix.\n\nSome experts propose that wasps first persuaded oaks to create galls and then evolved ways to draw ants into the equation. Others believe the ants\u2019 interest in fatty acids nudged the wasps toward this chemical strategy.\n\nNature relies on countless overlapping interactions. These gall-making wasps provide another example of how two different insects might develop a shared connection that benefits one party more than the other.\n\nWhile ants enjoy a quick snack from the gall\u2019s fatty hood, the wasp larvae receive a safe refuge for their development.\n\nThis unintentional partnership hints at how life weaves complex networks that bind different species together, often in ways that scientists have missed. Each time new details emerge, the broader narrative of ecological ties evolves.\n\nA nudge toward conservation\n\n\u201cThis should make us think about how much we still don\u2019t know about ecosystems and the need to preserve biodiversity,\u201d reflected Andrew Deans.\n\nThe researchers stressed the importance of keeping ecosystems intact to maintain these intricate ties.\n\nOak trees, and the wasps that make use of them, face threats from habitat decline and changing climates, which could unsettle the entire chain of relationships.\n\nWhen environments shift, the ants, the galls, and the plants lose a vital piece of the puzzle that supports their survival.\n\nWhere curiosity leads\n\nHugo\u2019s brief observation highlights how small moments can spark big changes in what we know. Nobody expected a child\u2019s quiet stroll to upend familiar ideas. Researchers are now curious to see if other insects use similar methods to coerce ants.\n\nBy peering into everyday wonders, people can gain a deeper appreciation of how species interact. Each fresh insight builds on the last, emphasizing the value of patient exploration and open minds in science.\n\nThe research findings were published in The American Naturalist.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

When powering an electric vehicle, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported that the rides are cleaner during their lifespans than gas cars, even when considering the costly and dirty supply chain for the hard-to-gather power pack parts.\n\nBut alternatives, from potassium to salt, sometimes have cheaper, safer, and even better-performing potential in greater temperature ranges.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing hydrogen ions is among the latest innovations from an expert lab. The UNSW Sydney team touted its tech as addressing fast charge and even safety concerns; lithium-ion packs are susceptible to rare yet serious fire risks.\n\n\"To enhance the usage of renewable energies, we have to develop some more efficient energy integration technologies and our proton battery design is a promising trial,\" doctoral candidate Sicheng Wu, who helped to develop TABQ, said.\n\nShould the U.S. invest more in battery innovations?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nTABQ was found in testing to support \"rapid proton movement using hydrogen-bond networks.\" The motion bodes well for energy density, or storage capacity per pound, as well as power output.\n\nThe anode research started with tetrachloro-benzoquinone, or TCBQ, according to the experts. The team modified some of its chemistry to create the useful TABQ anode. They combined it with a TCBQ cathode, garnering great results. The battery is reported to be able to last for 3,500 charge-discharge cycles and is well-suited for renewable energy storage, per the experts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cost savings are set to be realized as the concept is commercialized.\n\n\"If you just look at the TABQ material that we have designed, it's not necessarily cheap to produce at the moment,\" Zhao said. \"But because it's made of abundant light elements, it will be easy and affordable to eventually scale up.\"\n\nStoring intermittent energy from the sun, wind, and waves is necessary to transition to a cleaner power system, a switch already well underway. In the United States, renewables generate more than 20% of electricity, according to the government. Leveling off and reducing planet-warming fumes impacts our future in many ways, including education. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency listed overheating and other concerns in a fact sheet about the climate and young learners.\n\nCooling things down can start at home with some simple changes. Unplugging unused chargers and devices can prevent air pollution and save you upward of $165 a year, as one example.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt UNSW Sydney, the team said its hydrogen-ion battery can also provide a way to ship hydrogen as stored protons, an improvement on other more difficult transport methods.\n\n\"Our discovery has made this concept a possible reality,\" Zhao said.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "ABOVE: A newly discovered type of cartilage tissue makes tips of noses and ears bouncy and pliable. The fat-laden cells in this tissue are like individual bubbles in bubble wrap. \u00a9iStock, ediebloom\n\nThe smooth functioning of the body\u2019s joints, the flexibility of the ears and nose, and the shaping of bones are all made possible by the skeletal tissue known as cartilage.1 According to popular medical textbooks, cartilage is made up of only one type of specialized cell called a chondrocyte, which is small and secretes large quantities of extracellular matrix, giving cartilage its biomechanical properties.2 But now, new research makes these textbooks outdated.\n\nMore than a decade ago, while studying fat cells in the mouse ear skin, Maksim Plikus and his colleagues observed a puzzling pattern in dye uptake. \u201cThere were some fat cells that stained, which were the true adipocytes,\u201d said Plikus, a developmental biologist at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThen there was another group of fat cells that didn't [stain], no matter which marker.\u201d Initially, he thought these odd adipocytes could simply be a type that stubbornly resisted dyes. However, upon digging deeper, Plikus realized that they were a completely new type of fat-laden cartilage cells that formed the pliable lipo-cartilage in body parts like the nose, ear and throat. \u201cAt first we really had to pinch ourselves because it made no sense,\u201d Plikus exclaimed.\n\nThey called these newly-identified cells lipochondrocytes (LCs), and after a decade of investigation into their structure and function, the team published their report today in Science.3 These findings will expand the current understanding of skeletal biomechanics and open new avenues in regenerative medicine.\n\n\u201cThis is ground-breaking research,\u201d said Mark\u00e9ta Kauck\u00e1, a developmental biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThey found that the cells have different morphology, gene expression profiles, functions, and biomechanical properties. It really is a new cell type.\u201d\n\nResearchers have discovered a new type of cartilage cell called lipo-chondrocyte, that is filled with large fat droplets (shown here in green) and is found in many mammalian species. Maksim Plikus, University of California, Irvine\n\nDespite its prevalence in the body, researchers have overlooked LCs and lipo-cartilage for many decades. Lipochondrocytes were first observed in 1854 by Franz Leydig in rat ear cartilage and then largely forgotten for nearly a century.4 Even research groups that stumbled upon the cells later did not study them or the tissue in detail.5 So, when Plikus and his team came across these cells that looked like fat cells but were present in the cartilage, they knew they had to examine them from every possible angle.\n\nThe authors started by cataloging the presence of LCs in the mouse body. Using different genetic drivers, they identified LCs in the cartilage of the nose, larynx, sternum, and ear. Upon tracking the growth of LCs through development, the team found that these cells live for a long time and have limited turnover. LCs were even present in the nose and ears of aged mice.\n\nDepending on the location, the stiffness and pliability of cartilage varies. The team wanted to understand how the lipid vacuoles inside LCs modified these biomechanical properties of lipo-cartilage. After collecting lipo-cartilage, knee cartilage, and groin adipose tissue from one-month old mice, the researchers used different tests to measure how easily the tissue deformed and how much stress it could withstand. They observed that lipo-cartilage had a greater ability to resist tearing and deformation than adipose tissue but was less stiff than knee cartilage. This ability of lipo-cartilage to spring back to its original structure is what gives the ear and tip of nose their bounciness.\n\n\u201cLipochondrocytes are like the bubbles in bubble wrap,\u201d Plikus explained. \u201cIf you make a tissue out of the bouncy, non-compressible liquid-filled balloons, you will have elastic properties arising with analogy to the bubble wrap.\u201d When the team stripped LCs of the lipid vacuoles, the tissue became more rigid than normal lipo-cartilage and similar in biomechanical properties to the matrix-rich knee cartilage.\n\n\u201cThis will expand our understanding of skeletal biomechanics. Right now, people only think about the matrix,\u201d Plikus said. \u201cBut in lipo-cartilage, biomechanics derive from the organelles inside of the cells, not from the extracellular matrix. And that is paradigm shifting.\u201d\n\nWhile LCs looked like adipocytes, whole-tissue lipidomics performed on ear lipo-cartilage and groin adipose tissue revealed that the composition of the different fats varied between the two cell types. Adipocytes absorb and accumulate dietary fat molecules to feed their fat vacuoles, while Plikus observed that LCs had a relatively higher concentration of saturated fatty acid chains, which are produced during de novo lipogenesis, when carbohydrates are converted into lipids. When the team analyzed the levels of various genes in these cells, they noticed that, unlike adipocytes, LCs either did not express or expressed only low levels of genes encoding proteins responsible for transporting fatty acids into cells. Instead, the cells expressed genes involved in glucose transport, de novo lipogenesis, and triglyceride synthesis, strongly indicating that LCs produce their own fat vacuoles.\n\nAdipocytes can swell up or shrink down based on the available dietary fats. Since LCs did not express the genes to absorb external lipids, Plikus and his team were curious about their fate in the face of dietary fluctuations. They tested groups of mice on one of three different diets: a normal diet, a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, or a restricted-calories diet for 72 hours. While the animals\u2019 weight and fat tissue showed the expected increase or decrease based on the diet, the size of the ears and the lipid vacuoles in the ear LCs remained unchanged. When the team injected the mice with fatty acids labeled with a fluorescent marker, they found no accumulation in the LCs.\n\n\u201cIt's really brilliant how these mechanisms could be decoupled from the normal systemic lipid production and metabolism,\u201d Kauck\u00e1 said. \u201cYou don't want the locations which are in the ear and in the larynx to swell and enlarge when there\u2019s an influx of excess calories.\u201d\n\nRaul Ramos and Maksim Plikus, developmental biologists at the University of California, Irvine, discovered and characterized the lipo-cartilage tissue. Ethan Perez, University of California, Irvine\n\nFinally, Plikus wanted to know if lipo-cartilage is present in other species too. The team first examined human fetal cartilage at gestational week 20 to 21 and observed numerous lipid vacuoles in the ear, nose, thyroid, and epiglottal cartilage tissue. They also noted fat droplets in the cartilage organoids that they generated from human embryonic stem cells. RNA sequencing revealed that the cartilage organoids expressed de novo lipogenesis genes, but not fatty acid uptake genes.\n\nExpanding their study, the authors examined 65 other mammalian species and observed lipo-cartilage in many of them. \u201cThis makes a lot of sense. Mammals underwent a lot of adaptations and have novelties like the outer ear and the flexible tip of the nose,\u201d said Kauck\u00e1. \u201cThese are all locations which correlate with the presence of lipocartilage.\u201d Notably, the team found lipid-filled cartilage cells in species with thin, membranous ears, such as bats, suggesting a role for these cells in sound perception. The team did not identify lipo-cartilage in any of the non-mammalian species they tested.\n\nNext, Plikus plans to expand this research in several directions. Unlike LCs, when lipid droplets accumulate in chondrocytes within joints, these cells become sick, resulting in osteoarthritis. A deeper understanding of how LCs manage to stay healthy can aid the development of novel treatments for the disease. He also plans to use lipid vacuoles as biomarkers for purifying cartilage grown from patient cells and morphing them into desired shapes to advance regenerative medicine and surgeries such as rhinoplasties. Lastly, Plikus is curious to find out when lipo-cartilage evolved. As for Kauck\u00e1, she is curious how lipo-cartilage contributes to shaping facial features and why LCs and this fat-filled skeletal tissue seem to be restricted to mammals."

It is especially gut-wrenching when she refuses conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe family added that they\u2019ve tried to \u201chelp her find stability\u201d over the years \u201cwithout enabling harmful behaviors,\u201d but they claimed that despite their monthly financial support and help finding employment, Ann Altman, 30, \u201ccontinues to demand more money from us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe worst allegation she has made is that she was sexually abused by Sam as a child,\u201d the family wrote Tuesday, adding: \u201cHer claims have evolved drastically over time. Newly for this lawsuit, they now include allegations of incidents where Sam was over 18.\u201d\n\nAnn Altman\u2019s suit cited Missouri\u2019s Childhood Sexual Abuse law in claiming he committed his \u201clast acts of rape\u201d as an adult in 2006 when she was still a minor. She alleges the abuse began when they were both kids, and she was \u201cforced to touch his penis and perform oral penetration.\u201d\n\nSam Altman denied wrongdoing in a statement Tuesday alongside his mother and brothers. Markus Schreiber/Associated Press\n\nAnn Altman further alleged her brother started penetrating her \u201cwith his penis both vaginally and anally\u201d around 1999 or 2000. Her family claimed Tuesday they initially hoped to resolve this matter privately.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHowever, she has now taken legal action against Sam, and we feel we have no choice but to address this,\u201d they wrote, claiming she previously accused family members of \u201chacking her wifi, and \u2018shadowbanning\u2019 her from various websites including ChatGPT\u201d and X.\n\nAnn Altman\u2019s attorney, Ryan Mahoney, told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that his client has endured trauma but that \u201cthere is no evidence that her own mental health has contributed to her allegations.\u201d\n\nSam Altman was ousted as CEO in November, but three days later, after a series of negotiations, OpenAI reinstated him.\n\nNeed help?

            "article_content": "Great, here\u2019s the entitled journalist telling me that the $2,000 graphics card won CES 2025. I\u2019ve seen plenty of strong opinions about Nvidia\u2019s CES announcements online, but even ignoring the bloated price of the new RTX 5090, Nvidia won this year\u2019s show. And it kind of won by default. Between Intel\u2019s barebones announcements and an overstuffed AMD presentation that ignored what might be AMD\u2019s most important GPU launch ever, it\u2019s not surprising that Team Green came out ahead.\n\nBut that\u2019s despite the insane price of the RTX 5090, not because of it.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nNvidia introduced a new range of graphics cards, and the impressive multi-frame generation of DLSS 4, but its announcements this year were much more significant than that. It all comes down to the ways that Nvidia is leveraging AI to make PC games better, and the fruits of that labor may not pay off immediately.\n\nThere are the developer-facing tools like Neural Materials and Neural Texture Compression, both of which Nvidia briefly touched on during its CES 2025 keynote. For me, however, the standout is neural shaders. They certainly aren\u2019t as exciting as a new graphics card, at least on the surface, but neural shaders have massive implications for the future of PC games. Even without the RTX 5090, that announcement alone is significant enough for Nvidia to steal this year\u2019s show.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox!\n\nNeural shaders aren\u2019t some buzzword, though I\u2019d forgive you for thinking that given the force-feeding of AI we\u2019ve all experienced over the past couple of years. First, let\u2019s start with the shader. If you aren\u2019t familiar, shaders are essentially the programs that run on your GPU. Decades ago, you had fixed-function shaders; they could only do one thing. In the early 2000s, Nvidia introduced programmable shaders that had far greater capabilities. Now, we\u2019re starting with neural shaders.\n\nIn short, neural shaders allow developers to add small neural networks to shader code. Then, when you\u2019re playing a game, those neural networks can be deployed on the Tensor cores of your graphics card. It unlocks a boatload of computing horsepower that, up to this point, had fairly minimal applications in PC games. They were really just fired up for DLSS.\n\nIntroducing NVIDIA RTX Kit: Transforming Rendering with AI and Path Tracing\n\nNvidia has uses for neural shaders that it has announced so far \u2014 the aforementioned Neural Materials and Neural Texture Compression, and Neural Radiance Cache. I\u2019ll start with the last one because it\u2019s the most interesting. The Neural Radiance Cache essentially allows AI to guess what an infinite number of light bounces in a scene would look like. Now, path tracing in real time can only handle so many light bounces. After a certain point, it becomes too demanding. Neural Radiance Cache not only unlocks more realistic lighting with far more bounces but also improves performance, according to Nvidia. That\u2019s because it only requires one or two light bounces. The rest are inferred from the neural network.\n\nSimilarly, Neural Materials compresses dense shader code that would normally be reserved for offline rendering, allowing what Nvidia calls \u201cfilm-quality\u201d assets to be rendered in real time. Neural Texture Compression applies AI to texture compression, which Nvidia says saves 7x the memory as traditional block-based compression without any loss in quality.\n\nThat\u2019s just three applications of neural networks being deployed in PC games, and there are already big implications for how well games can run and how good they can look. It\u2019s important to remember that this is the starting line, too \u2014 AMD, Intel, and Nvidia all have AI hardware on their GPUs now, and I suspect there will be quite a lot of development on what kinds of neural networks can go into a shader in the future.\n\nMaybe there are cloth or physics simulations that are normally run on the CPU that can be run through a neural network on Tensor cores. Or maybe you can expand the complexity of meshes by inferring triangles that the GPU doesn\u2019t need to account for. There are the visible applications of AI, such as through non-playable characters, but neural shaders open up a world of invisible AI that makes rendering more efficient, and therefore, more powerful.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get lost in the sauce of CES. If you were to believe every executive keynote, you would walk away with literally thousands of \u201cground-breaking\u201d innovations that barely manage to move a patch of dirt. Neural shaders don\u2019t fit into that category. There are already three very practical applications of neural shaders that Nvidia is introducing, and people much smarter than myself will likely dream up hundreds more.\n\nI should be clear, though \u2014 that won\u2019t come right away. We\u2019re only seeing the very surface of what neural shaders could be capable of in the future, and even then, it\u2019ll likely be multiple years and graphics card generations down the road before their impact is felt. But when looking at the landscape of announcements from AMD, Nvidia, and Intel, only one company introduced something that could really be worthy of that \u201cground-breaking\u201d title, and that\u2019s Nvidia."

            "article_content": "Open-source software is common throughout the tech world, and tools like software composition analysis can spot dependencies and secure them. However, working with open source presents security challenges compared with proprietary software.\n\nChris Hughes, chief security advisor at open-source software security startup Endor Labs, spoke to TechRepublic about the state of open-source software security today and where it might go in the next year.\n\n\u201cOrganizations are starting to try to get some foundational things like governance in place to understand what we are using in terms of open source,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWhere does it reside in our enterprise? What applications are running it?\u201d\n\nOpen source security trends for 2025\n\nFor his work, Hughes defined open source as software for which source code is freely available and can be used to build other projects, possibly with some restrictions. Last year, Harvard Business School found organizations would need to invest $8.8 trillion in technology and labor time to recreate the software used in business if open-source software wasn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cThe estimates are 70-90% of all applications have open source, and roughly 90% of those code bases are entirely made up of open source,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nFor 2025, Hughes predicts:\n\nWidespread open-source software adoption will be accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks on OSS by malicious actors.\n\nOrganizations will continue to put foundational OSS governance in place.\n\nMore companies will use open-source and commercial tools to help them start to understand their OSS consumption.\n\nOrganizations will perform risk-informed consumption of OSS.\n\nEnterprises will continue to push for vendor transparency regarding what OSS they use in their products. However, no widespread mandates will arise for this process.\n\nAI will continue to impact application security and open source in various ways, including organizations using AI to analyze code and remediate issues.\n\nAttackers will target widely used OSS AI libraries, projects, models, and more to launch supply chain attacks on the OSS AI community and commercial vendors.\n\nAI code governance, where organizations have more visibility into AI models, will become more common.\n\nOrganizations increasingly want to know how secure their open source software is, including \u201chow well is it maintained, who\u2019s maintaining it and how quickly do they address vulnerabilities when they occur,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nHe highlighted the attack in April 2024 in which a string of social engineering attempts threatened open-source utilities, particularly opening a backdoor in the XZ Utils utility.\n\n\u201cThat one was really kind of sinister because the open source ecosystem is largely sustained by unpaid volunteers, folks doing this in their free time \u2026 and often not compensated, unpaid, etc.,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo, taking advantage of that and preying on that was a pretty nefarious thing that got a lot of people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nHow is AI changing open-source security?\n\nIn October 2024, the Open Source Initiative established a definition for open-source AI. According to the initiative, open-source AI has four key elements: the freedom to use, study, modify, and share the system for any purpose.\n\nHughes said that defining open-source AI was important because of the rise of distribution platforms like Hugging Face.\n\n\u201cThese AI models, especially the open source ones, are widely used by many organizations and individuals around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to asking: What exactly is in this, and who contributed to it, and where is it f\n\nrom? And are there vulnerable components?\u201d\n\nHughes said that large corporations may have a better chance of talking transparently with their vendors about the entirety of their software supply chain than small companies. Therefore, the problem of not having visibility into the AI models used in their software can grow exponentially for smaller companies.\n\nSEE: Smart home device makers will soon be able to apply for a U.S. government seal of security approval.\n\nCISA encourages open-source software development security\n\nIn March 2024, CISA finalized the secure software development self-attestation form, meant for developers of software used by the U.S. federal government to confirm they use secure development practices.\n\nFederal agencies may ask for other forms and attestations as well. On the commercial side, organizations may build similar requirements into their procurement processes. There is still an element of trust involved since the organization needs to trust the vendor will keep to their word. But the conversation is happening more often now than it did last year, in the wake of attacks on open source utilities, Hughes said.\n\nSolutions for the future of open source software security\n\nPerforming software composition analysis isn\u2019t enough going into 2025, Hughes said. IT professionals and security professionals should know that as software becomes more complex, the number of vulnerabilities has grown \u201cto where it\u2019s becoming a tax on developers to even navigate what needs to be fixed and what order of priority,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nCompanies like Endor Labs can provide insights on dependencies within open-source code, including indirect or transitive dependencies.\n\n\u201cBeing able to point to things like reachability and exploitability \u2026 could be a big benefit from the compliance perspective too, in terms of the burden on the organization and your development team,\u201d he said."

We may get a commission if you buy through our links.\n\nMicrosoft is starting strong the new year, pedaling hard on AI. According to a new blog post, the software giant is laying out the next big 6 trends that will shape the industry and workplaces by using AI agents.\n\nAI is poised for its next major leap. Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024, with organizations achieving a return of $3.70 for every $1 invested. AI is expected to contribute $2.7 trillion to Europe\u2019s GDP by 2030, as adoption accelerates, and businesses unlock value in as little as 13 months.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s predictions are mostly based on the latest IDC study cited in another blog post from the Redmont giant.\n\nHere are the key AI trends for 2025 according to Microsoft\n\n1. More capable and useful AI models\n\nMicrosoft believes that the AI models will continue to evolve into more capable version that will help solve a lot of complex problems in all areas including science, healthcare and even law. Generating code, executing workflows efficiently and comparing contracts will become the advanced tasks for the AI agents that will push forward the organization\u2019s productivity.\n\n2. The AI bots will redefine the work\n\nAn obvious prediction for AI agents is that they will take on the repetitive tasks that we don\u2019t want to deal with anymore. Microsoft mentions IT troubleshooting and workflow optimization, along with building workflows and writing code for developers that will only need to provide final touches to it. That makes a lot of sense, and we can already see a development in all those areas.\n\n3. AI agents will become our everyday companions\n\nAs you might have thought, Microsoft thinks that Copilot and its features such as Vision will become your new close buddy, providing all the information you need. Moreover, the bot will also discuss with you and disseminate the information to make things a lot more engaging and comprehensible.\n\nWhile we can see this going on in the future, probably 2025 is not the year this will suddenly happening. According to a Business of apps usage statistics, about 300 million people used AI apps in 2024. That includes all AI apps, not just Copilot.\n\nAccording to the same study, in October 2024, Copilot had 28 million active users and in September, the AI bot had 37 million visits. Those are hardly numbers to brag when we\u2019re talking about a solution becoming mainstream. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that Copilot can\u2019t be your friend if you want to, but we can\u2019t talk about AI agents starting to be every day companions.\n\n4. AI development will become more sustainable\n\nRight now, AI models use a lot of power and water to cool down those servers and the next major prediction is that the AI business will become more sustainable.\n\nMicrosoft is advancing green AI, building data centers that use zero water for cooling and operate on carbon-free energy sources like wind, geothermal, nuclear, and solar power. By 2030, Microsoft aims to be a carbon-negative, water-positive, and zero-waste company.\n\nThe only scary thing in the Microsoft rhetoric is nuclear, mentioned as a carbon-free energy source. Knowing the basics about this power source from the 80\u2019s, although being efficient, the nuclear powerplants still generate a disturbing amount of waste that we didn\u2019t yet learn how to dispose of properly.\n\n5. AI will be better kept in check\n\nThe most important problem right now with AI is that it doesn\u2019t really have any serious guardrails. Microsoft is seeing a change in 2025 for that aspect and it\u2019s testing how to address AI inaccuracies and limit the potential destructive power of AI being used irresponsibly.\n\nAlthough Microsoft is taking that task upon themselves, there are AI bots out there that can be customized in any aspect possible, providing means for wrongdoers to perform cyberattacks and other destructive actions.\n\n6. AI models will lead to scientific breakthroughs\n\nWith AI being very effective in performing a lot of calculations, it\u2019s reasonable to think that the computational models already have an impact in science discoveries. Microsoft\u2019s point is that along with improved models new innovations in research will also follow. They mention climate change study and public health being the major domains for development.\n\nLastly, Microsoft envisions a new era between AI models and agents led by an improvement on how Ai models will be trained.\n\nWith Microsoft investing billions of dollars into AI, we will clearly see new advancements in AI models and research. Whether or not 2025 will mark a cornerstone for AI remains to be seen. However, users don\u2019t seem so enthusiastic about using it so far. Actually, Copilot with its Windows Recall might be one of the reasons why Windows 10 users are not so keen in upgrading to Windows 11 just yet.\n\nWhat do you think about Microsoft\u2019s AI predictions for 2025? Let us know in the comments below."

The Supreme Court, in a recent judgment, highlighted this concern, stating that there is a \u201cgrowing tendency\u201d to use the law as a \u201ctool for unleashing personal vendetta\u201d against husbands and their families. A bench led by Justices B V Nagarathna and Kotiswar Singh warned that vague and generalized accusations in matrimonial disputes, if unchecked, could lead to arm-twisting tactics and harassment of innocent family members.\n\nChalla\u2019s story echoes these concerns. Her brother, an assistant professor in Hyderabad, married a woman from Rajahmundry in February 2019. Within days, the relationship turned hostile. \u201cShe misbehaved with my parents, barred my brother from his room, and threatened suicide repeatedly,\u201d Challa alleged. Ten days after the wedding, the woman left the family home and filed a 498A case, accusing the family of harassment.\n\nPratyusha Challa is an IIT IIM Graduate\n\n\n\nBut she is also a #498A \"accused\"\n\n\n\nHer sister-in-law who stayed with her family for just 10 days has implicated her entire family in #498A accusing them of dowry & domestic violence\n\n\n\nPratyusha has exactly 2 lines against her in FIR but\u2026 pic.twitter.com/wvEUp9Ln6n \u2014 Deepika Narayan Bhardwaj (@DeepikaBhardwaj) January 9, 2025\n\nChalla claimed the case was part of a broader extortion plan orchestrated by her sister-in-law and her family, who allegedly executed similar schemes in other instances. She further alleged that the FIR was lodged in violation of Supreme Court guidelines, without proper counseling or investigation.\n\n\u201cThe police even arrived in her private vehicle, making the process appear premeditated,\u201d Challa said.\n\nHer brother has made nearly 40 trips between Hyderabad and Rajahmundry for court hearings, often delayed due to the petitioner\u2019s absence. Meanwhile, her parents\u2019 health has deteriorated under the stress. \u201cThese five years have been nothing but traumatizing,\u201d Challa said.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s observations resonate with Challa\u2019s plight. In its recent ruling, the court quashed a 498A case, noting that vague and sweeping allegations without concrete evidence cannot justify criminal prosecution. The court emphasized the need for scrutiny to prevent misuse of legal provisions and undue harassment of innocent family members."

            "article_content": "Nature\u2019s connections can show up in the most unassuming places. For decades, people have watched curiously as ants collect seeds. These seeds often come with a fatty attachment that entices ants to take them underground, which is a nifty tactic employed by plants to get their seeds dispersed.\n\nThis strategy, known as myrmecochory, has guided ecological thinking for many years. Recent observations have shaken up this old concept, as a surprising twist has come from an unlikely source: oak galls produced by certain wasps.\n\nAnts and wasps\n\nEight-year-old Hugo noticed something puzzling one afternoon. He saw a small parade of ants scurrying across a path, hauling what he assumed were regular seeds.\n\nHis father, named Andrew Deans, took a closer look and realized these were oak galls, not plant seeds.\n\nGalls are growths shaped by wasps to ensure a safe shelter in which their larvae can develop. Hugo\u2019s discovery launched fresh inquiries into how wasps might be tricking ants into unwittingly providing protection and resources for their developing young.\n\nAndrew Deans is a professor of entomology at Penn State. His experiences with insect classification and ecology helped shape the next steps in understanding how certain wasps manipulate ant behavior.\n\nWorking with other researchers, he looked at the structure and chemical makeup of the oak galls, aiming to see whether these odd lumps mimic the enticing attachments found on seeds.\n\nThat line of inquiry opened the door to a bigger story about insect collaboration.\n\nThe lure of fatty acids\n\nResearch into seed dispersal has shown that ants love fatty acids, which they harvest from specialized structures on seeds.\n\nMany oak galls have a similar coating, sometimes called a hood, that contains these appealing molecules.\n\nOnce ants bring the gall inside their nest, they devour the fatty portion but leave the rest. Within that intact shell, the wasp larvae stay hidden from predators.\n\nThe parallels between seeds and galls have stirred fresh debate among entomologists.\n\nChemical camouflage\n\nThe biggest revelation for many scientists is that these gall hoods may imitate the scent of deceased insects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how these structures mimic the chemical profile of dead insects, one of the main food sources for ants,\u201d said John Tooker, professor of entomology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThis discovery sheds light on a possible reason behind the ants\u2019 brisk retrieval of galls. They are likely to think they have found a reliable meal, but end up giving wasp larvae a free ride and shelter instead.\n\nAnts, wasps, and evolution\n\nMillions of years before humans paid attention to them, galls were a feature on oak trees. Fossil records show that wasps and oaks have had a long relationship, although it is not clear when ants became part of the mix.\n\nSome experts propose that wasps first persuaded oaks to create galls and then evolved ways to draw ants into the equation. Others believe the ants\u2019 interest in fatty acids nudged the wasps toward this chemical strategy.\n\nNature relies on countless overlapping interactions. These gall-making wasps provide another example of how two different insects might develop a shared connection that benefits one party more than the other.\n\nWhile ants enjoy a quick snack from the gall\u2019s fatty hood, the wasp larvae receive a safe refuge for their development.\n\nThis unintentional partnership hints at how life weaves complex networks that bind different species together, often in ways that scientists have missed. Each time new details emerge, the broader narrative of ecological ties evolves.\n\nA nudge toward conservation\n\n\u201cThis should make us think about how much we still don\u2019t know about ecosystems and the need to preserve biodiversity,\u201d reflected Andrew Deans.\n\nThe researchers stressed the importance of keeping ecosystems intact to maintain these intricate ties.\n\nOak trees, and the wasps that make use of them, face threats from habitat decline and changing climates, which could unsettle the entire chain of relationships.\n\nWhen environments shift, the ants, the galls, and the plants lose a vital piece of the puzzle that supports their survival.\n\nWhere curiosity leads\n\nHugo\u2019s brief observation highlights how small moments can spark big changes in what we know. Nobody expected a child\u2019s quiet stroll to upend familiar ideas. Researchers are now curious to see if other insects use similar methods to coerce ants.\n\nBy peering into everyday wonders, people can gain a deeper appreciation of how species interact. Each fresh insight builds on the last, emphasizing the value of patient exploration and open minds in science.\n\nThe research findings were published in The American Naturalist.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Open-source software is common throughout the tech world, and tools like software composition analysis can spot dependencies and secure them. However, working with open source presents security challenges compared with proprietary software.\n\nChris Hughes, chief security advisor at open-source software security startup Endor Labs, spoke to TechRepublic about the state of open-source software security today and where it might go in the next year.\n\n\u201cOrganizations are starting to try to get some foundational things like governance in place to understand what we are using in terms of open source,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWhere does it reside in our enterprise? What applications are running it?\u201d\n\nOpen source security trends for 2025\n\nFor his work, Hughes defined open source as software for which source code is freely available and can be used to build other projects, possibly with some restrictions. Last year, Harvard Business School found organizations would need to invest $8.8 trillion in technology and labor time to recreate the software used in business if open-source software wasn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cThe estimates are 70-90% of all applications have open source, and roughly 90% of those code bases are entirely made up of open source,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nFor 2025, Hughes predicts:\n\nWidespread open-source software adoption will be accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks on OSS by malicious actors.\n\nOrganizations will continue to put foundational OSS governance in place.\n\nMore companies will use open-source and commercial tools to help them start to understand their OSS consumption.\n\nOrganizations will perform risk-informed consumption of OSS.\n\nEnterprises will continue to push for vendor transparency regarding what OSS they use in their products. However, no widespread mandates will arise for this process.\n\nAI will continue to impact application security and open source in various ways, including organizations using AI to analyze code and remediate issues.\n\nAttackers will target widely used OSS AI libraries, projects, models, and more to launch supply chain attacks on the OSS AI community and commercial vendors.\n\nAI code governance, where organizations have more visibility into AI models, will become more common.\n\nOrganizations increasingly want to know how secure their open source software is, including \u201chow well is it maintained, who\u2019s maintaining it and how quickly do they address vulnerabilities when they occur,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nHe highlighted the attack in April 2024 in which a string of social engineering attempts threatened open-source utilities, particularly opening a backdoor in the XZ Utils utility.\n\n\u201cThat one was really kind of sinister because the open source ecosystem is largely sustained by unpaid volunteers, folks doing this in their free time \u2026 and often not compensated, unpaid, etc.,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo, taking advantage of that and preying on that was a pretty nefarious thing that got a lot of people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nHow is AI changing open-source security?\n\nIn October 2024, the Open Source Initiative established a definition for open-source AI. According to the initiative, open-source AI has four key elements: the freedom to use, study, modify, and share the system for any purpose.\n\nHughes said that defining open-source AI was important because of the rise of distribution platforms like Hugging Face.\n\n\u201cThese AI models, especially the open source ones, are widely used by many organizations and individuals around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to asking: What exactly is in this, and who contributed to it, and where is it f\n\nrom? And are there vulnerable components?\u201d\n\nHughes said that large corporations may have a better chance of talking transparently with their vendors about the entirety of their software supply chain than small companies. Therefore, the problem of not having visibility into the AI models used in their software can grow exponentially for smaller companies.\n\nSEE: Smart home device makers will soon be able to apply for a U.S. government seal of security approval.\n\nCISA encourages open-source software development security\n\nIn March 2024, CISA finalized the secure software development self-attestation form, meant for developers of software used by the U.S. federal government to confirm they use secure development practices.\n\nFederal agencies may ask for other forms and attestations as well. On the commercial side, organizations may build similar requirements into their procurement processes. There is still an element of trust involved since the organization needs to trust the vendor will keep to their word. But the conversation is happening more often now than it did last year, in the wake of attacks on open source utilities, Hughes said.\n\nSolutions for the future of open source software security\n\nPerforming software composition analysis isn\u2019t enough going into 2025, Hughes said. IT professionals and security professionals should know that as software becomes more complex, the number of vulnerabilities has grown \u201cto where it\u2019s becoming a tax on developers to even navigate what needs to be fixed and what order of priority,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nCompanies like Endor Labs can provide insights on dependencies within open-source code, including indirect or transitive dependencies.\n\n\u201cBeing able to point to things like reachability and exploitability \u2026 could be a big benefit from the compliance perspective too, in terms of the burden on the organization and your development team,\u201d he said."

            "article_content": "Microsoft, the tech giant famous for innovation and its large workforce, has confirmed it will be reducing a small percentage of jobs in different departments based on performance.\n\nThis latest layoff is not a massive reduction but may signal a change in the strategy at Microsoft as it responds to the changing demands of the tech and AI competition.\n\nJob Cuts at Microsoft: The Details You Need to Know\n\nMicrosoft confirmed in a statement on Wednesday that less than 1% of its 228,000 employees will be affected by these latest job cuts. CNBC reports that sources familiar with the situation said layoffs are part of a broader performance evaluation strategy, aiming to optimize its workforce without major upheavals.\n\nFor context, this is the latest development in a round of layoffs coming after Microsoft's restructuring announcements. In early 2023, it made the news with a record layoff of 10,000 employees alongside office lease consolidation.\n\nWhen Microsoft post-acquired Activision Blizzard in January 2024, its gaming unit witnessed 1,900 job losses due to position overlap. Though the present layoff is small, they do draw attention in the context of Microsoft's overall performance.\n\nThe Bigger Picture: Microsoft's Market Performance\n\nWhile Microsoft continues to record great financial performance, the stock performance of the company in 2023 trailed its tech peers. Although a near-record net income margin of 38%, its highest since the early 2000s, Microsoft's stock only rose by 12% compared to 29% in the Nasdaq for the same period. It has triggered speculation on the company's future course and its potential to continue with growth in a competitive technology market.\n\nMicrosoft's Ties with OpenAI\n\nThe gargantuan rise of Microsoft's market cap last year was in significant part as a result of its relationship with the artificial intelligence start-up OpenAI.\n\nMicrosoft has invested over $13 billion into the firm and will now play a significant role in a new revolution in AI. At the close of 2024, there seems to be increasingly increasing tensions between the two.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella recently spoke on this \"cooperation tension\" in which he admitted OpenAI, an already formidable rival in its own right, had the potential to upset Microsoft's market position with its AI plays. The stakes are high and at a turning point for the company's AI strategy, considering the company's current role within the fast-moving AI sector.\n\nSlow Rollout of Microsoft 365 Copilot Worrisome to Investors?\n\nOne area of focus for Microsoft's future growth is its Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant, which leverages OpenAI's technology to integrate artificial intelligence into the company's productivity suite. However, early feedback suggests that the rollout of Copilot has been slower than expected.\n\nAnalysts from UBS recently noted that Microsoft's presentation at its Ignite conference in late 2023 left them with the impression that Copilot's adoption in the business world had been \"underwhelming.\"\n\nAs businesses increasingly look for AI-driven tools to improve productivity, Microsoft's ability to scale Copilot and similar offerings will be critical to its long-term success.\n\nThe company is under pressure to prove that its AI investments will yield substantial returns, particularly as it faces growing competition from other tech giants.\n\nHowever, despite the obstacles, Microsoft looks at the bright side of things. Its finance chief, Amy Hood, stressed that revenue growth in its Azure cloud services will increase in 2024 because of the rise in the expansion of AI infrastructure capacity.\n\nAzure's cloud platform is an integral part of Microsoft's long-term strategy, and it's setting up for the speedy expansion of AI and cloud-based services in the years ahead.\n\nWhile the recent job cuts may be seen as a short-term adjustment, Microsoft's focus on AI and cloud services indicates that it is preparing for a huge transformation in the tech landscape."

But they also drew on relationships developed over years with the militaries of non-NATO countries to build a network to aid Ukraine, something the administration considers a shining example of how its focus on strengthening alliances has paid dividends to U.S. interests around the world.\n\nOn Thursday, the collective of nations, known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, gathered at Ramstein Air Base in Germany for the 25th and final time under the Biden administration.\n\nWhether it continues under the incoming administration\u2019s leadership is uncertain. President-elect Donald J. Trump is deeply skeptical of supporting Ukraine, puts much less stock in alliances and has openly curried favor with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\n\nWhen the contact group first met on April 26, 2022, just 61 days after Russia invaded, the United States, Britain, France and a handful of other nations had been supporting Kyiv individually. But dozens more joined them in Germany to hear a battlefield update directly from their Ukrainian counterparts.\n\nThe massacre of civilians in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, had recently come to light. Mr. Austin and General Milley made it clear that similar atrocities were likely to happen without more arms and ammunition for Ukraine, and asked the assembled dignitaries to dig deep into their arsenals for desperately needed supplies."

            "article_content": "No-moat Avita Medical AVH downgraded its fourth-quarter 2024 commercial revenue guidance by 21% to USD 18 million. It now expects full-year commercial revenue of USD 64 million compared with its previous guidance of USD 68 million-USD 70 million. The downgrade implies fourth-quarter 2024 commercial revenue declining 6% on third quarter 2024's. We have cut our 2024 revenue forecast by 6% to USD 65 million but leave our long-term estimates unchanged. We keep our $5.40 fair value estimate with the time value of money and a stronger US dollar offsetting our near-term downgrade.\n\nAvita\u2019s downgrade was attributed to several customers adjusting inventory levels at year-end, resulting in reduced purchasing in December 2024. This behavior is typical, with sales in fourth-quarter 2023 being broadly flat with third-quarter 2023, but the extent was more pronounced than expected. Nonetheless, we do not see this hurting Avita\u2019s long-term opportunity. We leave our fiscal 2025 sales forecast of USD 101 million unchanged, implying 55% growth on the prior year on recent product launches. This compares with management\u2019s fiscal 2025 commercial revenue guidance of USD 100 million-USD 106 million.\n\nThe shares plunged close to 17% after the announcement but remain are undervalued. We expect Avita\u2019s expansion plan in Europe and Australia to help provide a path to positive cash flow by late 2025, in line with management\u2019s slightly revised expectation of hitting the milestone in fourth quarter 2025 from third quarter 2025 previously. However, a quicker transition to profitability is unlikely, and there is a wide range of potential outcomes based on the success of its vitiligo indication, which is reflected in our unchanged Very High Uncertainty Rating.\n\nCash burn was USD 10 million in third quarter 2024. We expect cash burn to continue improving into the single digits, allowing the firm to be self-sufficient before reaching profitability. Avita recorded USD 44 million in net cash as of Sept. 30, 2024, and has access to debt facilities if needed.\n\nAvita\u2019s road to profitability is long, but it continues to take the right steps\n\nWe expect Avita\u2019s RECELL to pose a significant challenge to the standard of care for larger burns, currently a skin graft sourced from elsewhere on the patient\u2019s body. We believe Avita will be successful based on the product\u2019s clinical performance, ease of use and relative price point. RECELL creates Spray-on Skin within 30 minutes from a skin sample, typically less than 5% of the size required in a graft. It has been clinically demonstrated to heal the burn site as effectively as a skin graft without creating a large donor site wound.\n\nDespite the technology in Avita\u2019s RECELL system being in use since the Bali bombings in 2002, the product has had limited commercial success as it entered the market as an investigational device. This limited the reimbursement and take-up of the product. RECELL relaunched in the US following randomized clinical trials and Food and Drug Administration approval in late 2018. Currently, it's approved for treating second- and third-degree burns in paediatric and adult patients.\n\nThe treatment of severe burns in the US is concentrated across the 136 burn centers, making commercial rollout of RECELL straightforward. Of the approximately 14,000 adults with second- or third-degree burns treated at these burn centers each year, we estimate Avita could ramp up to 34% share or 4,800 patients per year by fiscal 2026. The cost of RECELL compares favorably with a skin graft in this setting, as RECELL has a list price of USD 7,500 per single-use unit versus the USD 17,000 to USD 20,000 cost of a skin graft. It also has the benefits of shorter length of stay and fewer additional procedures.\n\nOutside of burn centers, the opportunity set is far more fragmented and because the burns are less severe, the cost of skin grafts average USD 2,000. As such, we expect limited take-up outside of burn centers, reaching 3% by fiscal 2031. Avita has received regulatory approval for an updated RECELL device that makes handling easier in a regular hospital environment. We expect the company will seek to justify reimbursement on a holistic cost of treatment and roll out the updated version in second-half fiscal 2022.\n\nAvita bulls say\n\nWe view Avita\u2019s RECELL system as a sound alternative treatment for large second- and third-degree burns treated in burn centers. It compares favorably on price and ease of use with new products and the existing standard of care being skin grafts.\n\nThe company requires little invested capital and is expected to generate very high returns once it ramps up its commercial roll-out.\n\nRECELL has achieved an estimated 20% market share in fiscal 2021 in its key addressable market since launching in 2019 and set to expand its use for other indications.\n\nAvita bears say\n\nAvita is still burning cash and the road to profitability depends on clinical readouts for further indications over the next few years, with the use of RECELL currently limited to adult and paediatric patients at burn centers.\n\nThe RECELL system is an assembly of tools with the only significant item being the vial of enzymes, so the effective price for the vial at a list price of USD 7,500 could be challenged by reimbursers.\n\nThe existing patents do not provide extended cover as expiries range between 2024 and 2034, and the very high gross margin of over 80% could come under pressure.\n\nTerms used in this article\n\nStar Rating: Our one- to five-star ratings are guideposts to a broad audience and individuals must consider their own specific investment goals, risk tolerance, and several other factors. A five-star rating means our analysts think the current market price likely represents an excessively pessimistic outlook and that beyond fair risk-adjusted returns are likely over a long timeframe. A one-star rating means our analysts think the market is pricing in an excessively optimistic outlook, limiting upside potential and leaving the investor exposed to capital loss.\n\nFair Value: Morningstar\u2019s Fair Value estimate results from a detailed projection of a company's future cash flows, resulting from our analysts' independent primary research. Price To Fair Value measures the current market price against estimated Fair Value. If a company\u2019s stock trades at $100 and our analysts believe it is worth $200, the price to fair value ratio would be 0.5. A Price to Fair Value over 1 suggests the share is overvalued.\n\nMoat Rating: An economic moat is a structural feature that allows a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period. Companies with a narrow moat are those we believe are more likely than not to sustain excess returns for at least a decade. For wide-moat companies, we have high confidence that excess returns will persist for 10 years and are likely to persist at least 20 years. To learn about finding different sources of moat, read this article by Mark LaMonica."

            "article_content": "The leading PC manufacturer used the Consumer Electronics Show to showcase their latest line-up of AI PCs powered by neural processing units (NPU). HP, Lenovo, Dell, Acer and Asus all demoed new AI PC offerings at the Las Vegas event.\n\nHP unveiled the Z2 Mini and ZBook Ultra, which the company claims enables users to engage in 3D design, render graphics-intensive projects simultaneously, and work locally with LLMs.\n\nThe new HP hardware is powered by AMD Ryzen AI Max PRO processor. HP said the ZBook Ultra offers features up to 16 desktop-class CPU cores, discrete-like integrated graphics, and up to 128GB of innovative unified memory architecture, and the ability to assign up to 96GB RAM to the graphics processing unit (GPU).\n\nLenovo used the event to demonstrate the enhanced user experience available on the Intel Core Ultra-powered Lenovo AI Now and Lenovo Aura Edition PCs.\n\nLenovo AI Now on the company\u2019s flagship ThinkPad X9 offers what Lenovo calls \u201can advanced on-device AI assistant\u201d to deliver real-time intelligence to users. Built on a local large language model (LLM) using Meta\u2019s Llama 3.0, Lenovo AI Now stores and processes all user data locally, which Lenovo said safeguards user information while delivering powerful, real-time AI capabilities. Lenovo said it can be used to automate and simplify tasks such as document organisation and device management, supporting AI applications such as natural language queries across locally stored documents.\n\nThe company said it will be expanding Lenovo AI Now\u2019s capabilities with the ability to search for information across PCs and supported tablet devices, and an intelligent search capability for retrieving relevant information from selected portions of images or documents.\n\nDell has focused on simplifying AI development on PCs. Its new Dell Pro AI Studio offers an AI toolkit with validated tools, frameworks, templates and models, to help developers and IT administrators build and manage AI software independent of the underlying silicon. Dell claims this can reduce development and deployment time by as much as 75%, going from six months to as little as six weeks.\n\nAcer\u2019s new Copilot+ lineup includes the Swift Go 16 AI and Swift Go 14 AI laptops and the Aspire C AI AIOs. These are powered by AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors. The hardware uses the AMD XDNA 2 NPU architecture, which Acer said delivers up to 50 TOPS (tera operations per second) of AI performance and includes AMD Radeon 800M graphics. According to Acer, the new Swift Go AI laptops are able to run efficiently and reliably for all-day use with a battery life of up to 24.9 hours of video playback. It has also introduced the Intel Core-powered Aspire S AI and Revo Box AI devices.\n\nBeyond x86-based AI PCs, Asus unveiled its Snapdragon-powered Zenbook A14. This device uses the Snapdragon X Series Processors and offers up to 45W TDP performance along with a neural processing capability of 45 TOPS. Asus claims it offers up to 32 hours of battery life, which can be further extended or customised with MyASUS Battery Care Mode. The device includes 2 USB 4.0 ports, an audio jack, a type-A port and an HDMI port."

            "source": "ZDNet",
            "article_content": "SEAN GLADWELL/Getty Images\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is when brands make major announcements for product releases and unveil cool concepts and mockups for future projects. So it's no surprise that Genki -- a third-party gaming and PC accessories manufacturer -- showed off some new devices.\n\nAlso: CES 2025: The 15 most impressive products you don't want to miss\n\nWhat caught us off guard, however, was Genki's alleged mockup of a Nintendo Switch 2 console and Joy-Con controllers. Just how much does this confirm previous leaks? And is there any new information about the upcoming console ahead of Nintendo's official announcement later this year? Here's everything we know -- and don't know -- about Genki's Switch 2 mockup.\n\nWhat we know\n\nGenki (aka, Human Things Inc.) is a third-party manufacturer of gaming accessories.\n\nGenki's accessory focus is power and storage solutions (cases, SSDs, wall chargers).\n\nGenki showed up to CES 2025 with an alleged mockup of the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nGenki claims the Switch 2 will be released in April.\n\nNintendo plans to officially announce the Switch 2 sometime before the end of Q1 2025\n\nWhat we don't know\n\nHow did Genki get a hold of a fully 3D-printed mockup?\n\nWhy would the company risk Nintendo's notoriously litigious wrath by leaking significant details ahead of an official announcement?\n\nIs this a viral marketing stunt for their accessories?\n\nWhen will the Switch 2 be released?\n\nHow much will the Switch 2 cost at release?\n\nIn typical fashion, official Nintendo channels have neither confirmed nor denied any of the details provided by Genki and its mockup of the Switch 2. But that hasn't stopped the rumor mill from going into high gear. A few things seem to corroborate, if not confirm, previous leaks -- such as the potential for magnetic Joy-Con controllers and the console itself being bigger than the current Switch OLED.\n\nExciting as all this is, however, something feels off. First, Genki's mockup looks remarkably like some debunked CAD files leaked to Reddit in 2024. The source of those files claimed to have obtained console information from a third-party manufacturer \"at great cost\" and \"reverse-engineered\" the CAD files.\n\nWith Nintendo being such a hot commodity, it's not outside the realm of possibility that this could be an elaborate attempt to drum up interest in Genki's (frankly) run-of-the-mill accessories, which consist mostly of USB-C cables and video capture cards that look sourced from other manufacturers and branded with the Genki logo.\n\nAlso: This low-cost Lenovo PC is the desktop I recommend to most people - even though its made for gamers\n\nI wasn't able to find any details on Human Things Inc. other than a suspiciously empty LinkedIn page with a URL that leads directly back to the Genki retail page. Their blog is woefully sparse, with just four posts; the first in 2019, one in 2023, and two from 2024. None make mention of any company operations, but the site's front page proudly tells you they were successfully backed on Kickstarter by over 50,000 people.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, the alleged Switch 2 leak feels more like a poorly planned viral marketing effort. And Genki isn't the first vendor to take this approach. In December 2024, Canadian company Dbrand claimed to have obtained official 3D scans of the Nintendo Switch 2 from an unspecified source to promote their Killswitch 2 case.\n\nIn the end, this alleged leak doesn't add any significant new information and doesn't confirm anything we didn't already hear before. Nintendo is set to make an official announcement regarding the Nintendo Switch 2's release date, retail price, and tech specs sometime before April 2024."
