        "article_content": "If I had to recommend a single indie release this year, it'd probably be Mossmouth's UFO 50, mainly because it's a retro game anthology that actually feels like it could've been made back in the NES era (for the most part) while offering a fresh package.\n\nAmidst the usual onslaught of huge releases towards the end of the year, it's hard to find time for smaller titles if you're in this line of work. Hell, I spend like half of my work hours consuming and writing about other stuff, yet video games are the medium that requires more time and attention. It's easy to get burned out, which is why smaller and breezier games are almost as important as the big ones to stay healthy.\n\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nFor the last few weeks, UFO 50 (only available on Steam for now) has been my 'game to play while having something on in the background' and I couldn't be more impressed with what Derek Yu and the talented developers behind Downwell, Air Land & Sea, Skorpulac, Catacomb Kids, and Madhouse have put together over nine flippin' years (check out this report on the collection that VG247 published... back in 2017).\n\nOf course, almost everyone has had more projects in the works meanwhile. Chief among them was Spelunky 2, which Yu finally unleashed in 2020. Meanwhile, UFO 50 continued to evolve in silence, and this last September it dropped without making much noise until the press got on top of it. After spending some time (less than I'd like) with it myself, I'm happy to report folks were not exaggerating. This thing whips and should be in the GOTY conversations coming up.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nSure, plenty of solo developers and indie studios have totally nailed the NES-era aesthetic and overarching design philosophies over the years (I just won't stop here to name countless examples), yet a recurring feeling I have is that most of those either feel a tad too modern despite everything else or just old in the worst possible way (rusty and not very fun to play). UFO 50, meanwhile, while not a complete home run (I mean, it literally packs 50 fully-featured, old-ass titles), completely feels like one of those bootleg cartridges full of whatever.\n\nI'm not gonna lie: I noped the f**k out of a handful of the games I've played so far, mainly because I wasn't in the mood to figure out obtuse mechanics or perfect timings, but almost no title in this fictional collection has felt bland or uninspired. There's a clear intent and vision behind all of them, and even if many don't click with me, I can see someone else enjoying the crap outta them. After all, they cover all sorts of genres and even try to replicate the 'evolution' of a fictional game company during the 1980s. Of course, this has led players to discover a meta layer that only makes the package even nuttier.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nControls are kept pretty simple in most cases too, which definitely helps the accessibility factor that permeates the whole thing. I'd consider most of the games included 'hard' by today's standards, but in most cases, it all comes down to the unique game design and the developers going 'look, you gotta master this s**t like back in the day, no excuses' (which rocks). This also applies to titles that include a multiplayer option or are straight-up designed as local party games; they're meant to be easy to pick up and just play in quick sessions.\n\nThis ain't a review, so I won't pretend to have played the full collection nor I'll get into specifics. This is a super juicy bundle of joy that I'll be playing for a long time, and I'm taking my time with it. It shines brighter when played between larger gaming sessions or during lunch breaks, and I strongly believe it doesn't benefit from brain-rotting, sweaty marathons better suited for modern video games. This is the message I'm trying to get across; I want you to discover what it has to offer for yourself.\n\nImage credit: Mossmouth\n\nThis also means it's sort of the perfect game to play on your Steam Deck; I'd be surprised if it doesn't reach the Switch sooner rather than later. Instead of \"one more round,\" you'll be saying \"one more game,\" as you never know what you'll come across next. It's okay if you never beat them, as the experience alone of booting them up and fumbling around is magical and enriching enough. In a way, UFO 50 brings back that magic of ancient games you booted up over and over again but rarely managed to beat. Achievements await true sickos though.\n\nOkay, maybe I'll let you have some of my personal recommendations so far before I leave: Mortol, Velgress, Attactics, Bushido Ball, Camouflage, Campanella, Warptank (this one is genuinely fantastic), and Porgy. Try not to look them up before jumping in, trust me. This wild ride shouldn't be spoiled by our modern model of consumption. Your list of favorites might look very different, and that's the entire point of this trip down a memory lane that doesn't quite exist."

        "article_content": "Now that we have so many startups offering AI bots that can do everything from listening to your meetings and transcribing them, to taking notes and surfacing insights, companies in the space are being forced to differentiate themselves by offering additional feature sets and integrations.\n\nOne such company, Read AI is trying to do just that by integrating its AI bot with email, Slack, and enterprise tools like HubSpot, Jira, and Confluence. And to accelerate its product development, the startup recently raised $50 million in a Series B funding round led by Smash Capital. Notably, the new round comes just six months after the startup raised a $21 million Series A.\n\nCo-founder David Shim told TechCrunch that the company has seen strong customer growth since its Series A earlier this year \u2014 it has had more than 100,000 new accounts created across enterprises and individual users \u2014 and the company sought to leverage that growth.\n\n\u201cIn less than six months, we\u2019ve doubled our sign-ups, active users, and [monthly recurring revenue], surpassing even our most aggressive projections. We\u2019re leveraging this momentum to raise now,\u201d he said.\n\nShim didn\u2019t disclose Read AI\u2019s valuation, but he did say that its valuation saw a bump to match its growth.\n\nBrad Twohig, co-founder and managing partner at Smash Capital, said that when investing, he often looks for companies that employ a product-led growth model, and Read AI fits that requirement well.\n\n\u201cI love finding companies in spaces that both cater to a large group of people and have an enterprise component at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\nProduct evolution\n\nRead AI started supporting integrations with email, messages, and meeting apps earlier this year, and the company is today releasing a Chrome extension that can display your schedules, meeting reports, a quick add-to-meeting option, and insights from meetings.\n\nThe extension can highlight key points within lengthy email threads, and can create email drafts that take into context previous emails, messages, and meetings. It also highlights quick notes from meetings or Slack messages about the same topics in email threads.\n\nEmail clients from providers like Shortwave and Superhuman also offer similar capabilities.\n\nImage Credits:Read AI\n\nRead AI is offering the Chrome extension for free. Shim noted the new fundraise was another reason to develop and scale products like this and offer them without cost.\n\n\u201cWherever you work, we\u2019re pulling in that content, and we\u2019re giving you summaries, we\u2019re giving you recommendations. That\u2019s a bigger opportunity, but there is a bigger cost center associated with it. We\u2019re focusing on growing that market while maintaining the lead that we have on the meeting notes side,\u201d Shim said.\n\nImage Credits:Read AI\n\nSmash Capital\u2019s Twohig feels services that transcribe meetings are becoming a commodity, but Read AI\u2019s approach of deploying its AI bot everywhere can help it become a fine business.\n\n\u201cWe ran into Read AI as an assistant showing up at meetings and taking notes. But when we sat down with David, we understood a broader vision and concept of having a co-pilot anywhere. This tool can follow you through day-to-day tasks, keep helpful records, and allow you to be a better teammate.\u201d\n\nRead AI currently has 40 employees and the company aims to expand its staff to 100 people by the end of the Q1 2025.\n\nThe Series B round also saw participation from existing investors Madrona and Goodwater Capital."

        "article_content": "Timed with Halloween, a group of thrill-seekers gathered at Oak Park\u2019s historic Pleasant Home on Friday to learn more about the 19th century mansion\u2019s alleged supernatural occurrences from experts.\n\nParticipants explored the historic Pleasant Home alongside a team of paranormal investigators from The Other Side Investigations, roaming the eerie rooms and corridors of Pleasant Home using ghost-hunting equipment to uncover the mysteries behind its storied past and reported supernatural phenomena.\n\nIn small groups, attendees explored different areas of the house. Equipped with devices provided by The Other Side Investigations team, they searched for signs of paranormal activity. The Other Side Investigations team guided them through the experience explaining the equipment used to detect paranormal activity, such as the REM Pod, ghost box, and K2 meters. They also shared personal stories and insights from their own ghost hunting experiences.\n\nAnd indeed, after the event, some claimed to have experienced some paranormal activity.\n\nOak Park resident Elli Wade, visiting Pleasant Home for the first time, said the group encountered some paranormal activity in the billiard room. Wade was holding the K2 Meter while in a circle with other attendees sitting down and the reading of the K2 meter went from a 0.1 to a 0.4 reading. The Other Side Investigations told the room that because of the change of that meter, there was paranormal activity going on.\n\n\u201cIt was very cool to actually see it happen in front of my eyes,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThis is such a beautiful house and it\u2019s fun to do something like this. I\u2019ve never done anything like this before. I love Halloween. We joke that Halloween is my Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nPhoto provided\n\n\u201cThis was a little sample bite and appetizer of ghost hunting. We love to help people. Sometimes the unknown is very scary for some people,\u201d said Lesley Tuton, an investigation coordinator from the team.\n\nThe Other Side Investigations acquisitioner David Amesquita shared his hopes for the event, saying he wanted attendees to experience the beauty of Pleasant Home firsthand. For those who hadn\u2019t visited before, he felt it was a perfect opportunity to appreciate the mansion\u2019s charm up close.\n\n\u201cI go out and try to find different locations for us to visit, whether it\u2019s through various park districts or libraries. I try to get our name out there and secure more places to explore. I also look for different haunted houses and people often reach out to me so we can set something up,\u201d Amesquita said.\n\nNoelle Combs, historic properties and special events coordinator for the Park District of Oak Park, started her work with the park district in March and has had her fair share of eerie experiences at Pleasant Home.\n\nCombs told the group that she recently saw a figure in a top hat walk by in the mirror that can be seen when heading up to the second floor and when she looked up, there was nothing.\n\nCombs said she has seen unexplained door slammings and that Susan Crane, the historic properties and special events manager, smelled tobacco when nobody would be smoking.\n\n\u201cI never feel scared in this house. I didn\u2019t want to tell anyone about those things. You guys are experts, but like you said, you only get to come at night. I\u2019m here sometimes from nine in the morning until eleven at night and things do happen,\u201d Combs said.\n\nEvent attendees also heard about the rich history of Pleasant Home from Paula Fenza, a docent for the mansion for more than nine years. Fenza said that Pleasant Home was built in 1897 by architect George Washington Maher for John Farson, his wife, Mamie, and their two sons, John Jr. and William. The family moved into the house in 1899.\n\n\u201cJohn and Mamie had wonderful, lavish parties. They would be so happy to see all of you here, because this is what they loved to do, welcome people into their home,\u201d Fenza said.\n\nPhoto provided\n\nAfter John Farson died in 1910, Mamie sold Pleasant Home, along with its custom furnishings, to inventor Herbert Mills, known for creating the slot machine and the railroad crossing gate. Mills lived in the house with his wife Leonie and their eight children until his death in 1929, followed by Leonie\u2019s passing in 1930.\n\nIn 1939, the children sold the house and its four-acre estate to the Park District, stipulating two conditions: the grounds were to be opened as a public park named Mills Park in honor of their father; and the home was to be preserved and used as a gathering space for the community. Today, Pleasant Home serves as a historic landmark and venue for guided tours and local events.\n\nThe Other Side Investigations team is expected to return to Oak Park this spring for another public investigation, this time at the historic Cheney Mansion.\n\nRelated"

Photo / Stephen James - CHB Paranormal Society\n\nThus far, the group investigations have found mainly real-world solutions to the spooky happenings across the Bay.\n\n\u201cThere was this case in Waipukurau where the tenants that were living there at the time were getting angry and yelling at everybody,\u201d Wedd said.\n\n\u201cBut when they went downstairs, they were fine. So, it was something to do with upstairs.\n\n\u201cThere was a big old electrical box that was up there. So I think it was emitting electricity, and it was making them grumpy and angry and shouting at the family and things. So we sorted it.\u201d\n\nThere is still one unexplained case on their books from 2018.\n\n\u201cWe were at Napier Prison actually, when we were up there doing an investigation and we were standing there asking questions and I saw this like light anomaly go past me and then we heard this woman\u2019s voice and I thought wow, that was pretty cool.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything, just sort of moaned or sighed.\u201d\n\nHalloween is approaching, but Wedd doesn\u2019t believe that the supposed spooky season generates more paranormal experiences.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just a myth, but you never know. I\u2019ve been doing it for a long time but I\u2019m still learning myself.\u201d\n\nTo be completely clear, no mainstream science suggests the supernatural exists, and there is plenty of scepticism about the group\u2019s activities.\n\nWedd said she knew there were a lot of sceptics in Hawke\u2019s Bay.\n\nShe said they may be experiencing paranormal activity, but don\u2019t want to acknowledge it.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t want to talk about it. That\u2019s what I\u2019m finding, people don\u2019t want to talk about Hawke\u2019s Bay\u2019s hauntings.\u201d\n\nWedd encourages anyone having supernatural, strange, or freaky encounters in the Bay to get in touch with the society via its Facebook page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Between appearing in Stranger Things, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, and It, a a two-part adaptation of the 1986 Stephen King novel, Finn Wolfhard has certainly experienced his fair share of faux supernatural terror.\n\n\u201cBut there was a time when I was a kid shooting It in this abandoned mansion in Toronto, and me and a bunch of the other cast were exploring the floors,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cWe went up to the top floor and there was one room where we saw a guy in black just kind of doing electrician work, and we were just like, \u2018Okay, that\u2019s just a crew member.\n\n\u201cBut then later, we found out that no one knew who that was, and no one ever saw him again.\n\n\u201cIt could have been someone just messing around, but, yeah, it was pretty scary.\u201d\n\nYes, because dressing up in black and doing some electrical work is definitely the most common way to scare someone in an abandoned mansion, right?\n\nFinn Wolfhard returns as Mike Wheeler in the fifth and final season of Stranger Things which will air on Netflix\u2026 sometime in 2025, we think.\n\nIn the meantime, he will appear in the film Saturday Night, about the night of the 1975 premiere of the NBC sketch comedy variety show that would go on to be known as Saturday Night Live.\n\nThe now 21-year-old will also be seen in the upcoming fantasy film The Legend of Ochi, also starring Helena Zengel, Emily Watson, and Willem Dafoe."

The Stuttgart Regional Council\u2019s State Office for Monument Preservation just recently announced the find.\n\nNoteworthy for the remarkable quality of its preservation, the oak timber burial chamber still retains its floor, walls, and ceiling, making it the first fully preserved Celtic burial chamber found in Germany since 1890.\n\n\n\npicture alliance // Getty Images Roberto Tarpini, consultant and research assistant at the State Office for the Preservation of Monuments, stands at the burial chamber and explains the discovery and excavation of a completely preserved wooden burial chamber to representatives from politics and the media.\n\n\u201cThe newly discovered burial chamber represents an extraordinary testimony of our rich monument landscape,\u201d remarked local official Andrea Lindlohr at a press conference, \u201cAround 2,600 years after its construction, the [burial chamber] is still fully preserved. The archaeological heritage of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg is impressive and opens insights into long-gone periods and societies.\u201d\n\nThe timbers have yet to undergo a thorough analysis for the purposes of dating, but the burial chamber is assumed to have been built between 620 BCE and 450 BCE\u2014when the Celts roamed that region of Germany.\n\nRelated Story This Ancient Tomb Shows Off A Snake Fixation\n\nFound near the burial chamber was a wooden tool\u2014possibly one that was used in the building of the chamber itself. Experts have determined that it was made from the wood of an oak tree, chopped down in 585 BCE.\n\nGiven how long it\u2019s been since a burial chamber of this quality has been discovered in the region, and the myriad of advances in archaeological and analytical technology in those intervening years, this discovery offers an incredible opportunity to understand more about this period of history.\n\n\u201cThe Riedlingen grave is a stroke of luck for archaeology,\u201d noted Dirk Krausse, an archaeologist with the State Office for Cultural Heritage Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, \u201c...the scientific significance of this fully preserved Celtic chamber grave, investigated using modern methods, extends far beyond the boundaries of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and southern Germany.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (gen AI) is paving the way for everyone to become their own software developers. But at the same time, AI may render many extraordinary skills unnecessary.\n\nThat's the word from Thomas Davenport of Babson College and Ian Barkin, a venture capitalist, in their latest book, All Hands on Tech: The AI-Powered Citizen Revolution. For starters, they point out that with low-code and no-code tools, robotic process automation, and now AI, the gates of software development are open to all.\n\nAlso: AI scams have infiltrated the knitting and crochet world - why it matters for everyone\n\n\"Technology is no longer owned by any one department of function,\" they explain. \"Data and its analyses are no longer the property of only the PhDs and the hard-core number crunchers. From now on, all employees have the ability to be system designers, data analysts, coders, and creators.\"\n\nDavenport and Barkin note that generative AI will take citizen development to a whole new level. \"First is through conversational user interfaces,\" they write. \"Virtually every vendor of software today has announced or is soon to introduce a generative AI interface.\"\n\n\"Now or in the very near future, someone interested in programming or accessing/analyzing data need only make a request to an AI system in regular language for a program containing a set of particular functions, an automation workflow with key steps and decisions, or a machine-learning analysis involving particular variables or features.\"\n\nAs the authors mention, part of this future -- not quite formed yet -- are specialized bots designed to perform specific types of work. \"There are digital workers from RPA vendors and other start-ups that claim to perform an entire job, although our investigations thus far suggest that they really perform just a few tasks and are certainly less flexible than human workers.\"\n\nAlso: Google survey says more than 75% of developers rely on AI. But there's a catch\n\nThis includes nascent software development bots, which vendors claim are \"able to write software programs from start to finish,\" Davenport and Barkin state. \"Our guess is that for the next several years, these bots will be capable of making human citizens more productive but won't replace them.\"\n\nGen AI will feel like the ultimate research assistant or programmer, they added, \"because it is generating code to this analysis. It will elicit what you want, work very quickly, and allow you to change your mind infinite times in specifying your app, automation, or model.\"\n\n\"Gen AI will also make it easier to find existing models, features, or software components that you can use to begin your citizen project,\" they conclude.\n\nAlso: How ChatGPT scanned 170k lines of code in seconds, saving me hours of work\n\nLooking beyond these early starts, with the growth of AI, RPA, and other tools, \"some citizen developers are likely to no longer be necessary, and every citizen will need to change how they do their work,\" Davenport and Barkin speculate. Gen AI will assume much of this work, including generating application code, automations, and data science analyses.\n\nDominic Ligot, CEO and CTO of CirroLytix, echoes Davenport and Barkin's observations in a recent HackerNoon article, noting how he enabled semi-technical individuals in a class to leverage data science tools:\n\n\"The participants, primarily CISOs who typically don't code, found the exercises, crafted with AI's assistance, to be intuitive and hands-on. My goal was to immerse them in working directly with data and code. They especially appreciated the chance to explore manually what modern cyberthreat surveillance and SIEM platforms typically automate, gaining insights into the processes happening 'under the hood.'\"\n\nAt the same time, Ligot also suggests citizen developers and data scientists may not necessarily need technical skills, as AI takes on much of this work. \"My key takeaway from the class was surprisingly counterintuitive: data science, as we know it, will eventually be replaced by AI,\" he said.\n\nAlso: Technologist Bruce Schneier on security, society and why we need 'public AI' models\n\n\"The rise of AI-driven tools capable of handling data analysis, modeling, and insight generation could force a shift in how we view the role and future of data science itself,\" said Ligot. \"Tasks like data preparation, cleansing, and even basic qualitative analysis -- activities that consume much of a data scientist's time -- are now easily automated by AI systems.\"\n\n\"What's worse (or better, depending on where you stand) is that AI is faster, more accurate, and less prone to human error or fatigue.\"\n\nStill, getting to the point where development and data science are delivered seamlessly via AI will take time, Davenport and Barkin clarify. \"It seems likely in the future that gen AI and conversational AI broadly will be the front end to all citizen applications,\" they say. \"That's possible today with many tools, but it takes at least a modicum of sophistication to create prompts that will get you the first cut at an app, a data analysis, or an automation workflow that you want. That's also true with code generations, and it's one reason why experienced coders tend to have better luck than inexperienced ones.\"\n\nAlso: The best AI for coding in 2024 (and what not to use)\n\nHowever, they continued, \"within a year or two, it will be possible to have an iterative discussion with a gen AI interface about a machine-learning analysis.\""

There\u2019s an \u201cagent\u201d component, as well. The platform connects to other enterprise systems to undertake tasks on behalf of the customer without humans being involved.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly no shortage of competition in the chatbot space. But Sierra claims its tech is less susceptible to hallucinations, the made-up facts AI models occasionally spew.\n\nSierra also lets customers customize its AI\u2019s personality to their corporate brand, using a \u201cconstellation\u201d of generative AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, among others, to complete tasks and check for accuracy.\n\nTaylor and Bavor have a long history in customer service tech. Taylor spent nearly a decade at Salesforce, and years ago founded Quip, which Salesforce bought for $750 million in the summer of 2016. Bavor managed Gmail and Google Drive at Google, among other products.\n\nTaylor met Bavor while at Google, where he worked before serving as Facebook\u2019s CTO for several years. At Google, Taylor is widely credited with helping to launch Google Maps. Years later, he\u2019d oversee the Twitter board throughout the social network\u2019s takeover by Elon Musk.\n\nInvestors in Sierra\u2019s newest round included ICONIQ, Thrive Capital, and Iconiq. Greenoaks Capital led the round, which brings Sierra\u2019s total raised to $285 million, per Crunchbase.\n\n"
