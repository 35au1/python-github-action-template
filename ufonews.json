            "article_content": "On the night of August 10, 2022, five pilots on two separate commercial airline flights were wholly convinced they\u2019d documented proof of an Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP) over the Pacific Ocean. Pilots from both flights reported seeing odd lights zipping through the sky\u2014but the single incident they all witnessed turned out to be Starlink telecommunications satellites.\n\nIn recent years, pilots\u2014as well as the public\u2014have mistakenly identified these low-Earth orbit satellites as UAPs. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of 69 reports just from January 23\u2013April 27, 2023 that identify \u201cUFO-UAP,\u201d and according to one paper , more than a third of them could be Starlink satellites. Unfortunately, such mysterious sightings lead to pilot confusion and potential safety consequences because of the distraction and extra chatter about them over the airwaves.\n\nThe core issue with pilots misidentifying satellites as UAPs stems from the fact that pilots cannot access real-time data about satellite movements, leaving them unprepared to recognize strange lights in the sky. These satellites may appear to move in unexpected ways, based on their orientation, and they may also appear and disappear, since their solar arrays reflect sunlight at different angles when deployed, relative to the pilot\u2019s position in flight.\n\nStarlink satellites orbit about 342 miles above Earth, according to Starlink\u2019s website, and that places them lower than most other satellites, making them visible to our eyes as spots of light, no magnification needed. More than 6,000 Starlink satellites are currently circling Earth, and the SpaceX-owned company aims to eventually have 42,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit, which means pilots will need to have surefire methods for identifying them.\n\n\n\nGetty Images The passage of Starlink satellites is seen in the sky over southern Poland on November 1, 2024.\n\nFour scientists want to fill the information gap in this type of situation to prevent unnecessary aviation risk. Led by mechanical engineer Douglas J. Buettner of the University of Utah, the team devised a method to simulate the exact locations of satellites, and they proposed plans that would provide pilots with the information they need to quickly identify satellites. Their paper describing this work was accepted at the 2024 International Academy of Astronautics Conference on Space Situational Awareness (ICSSA).\n\nTo shed some light on what the five pilots saw, the scientists conducted an \u201castrometric analysis\u201d of their reports, using two cell phone photos and a video the pilots had taken of \u201can unrecognized and possibly anomalous phenomenon,\u201d according to the paper. To corroborate the data, researchers looked up Starlink\u2019s records, noting that the visual line the satellites created in the sky\u2014called a \u201ctrain\u201d of satellites\u2014launched that same day. The team also used data from the flight, including photographs taken in the cockpit. Using these pieces of information and an orbital mechanics software tool, they were able to reconstruct the August 10 cockpit view. It showed Starlink satellites matching both the time and place of the sighting.\n\nTheir analysis used a technique called \u201cray-traced rendering\u201d of the view from the pilots\u2019 cockpit, which provided a more visual simulation of exactly where the pilots saw the satellites through their cockpit windows, according to the paper. The simulation experiments indicated that the satellites\u2019 solar arrays must have been deployed, likely making them glint brightly enough for the pilots in both aircraft to notice them. \u201cIn the implementation of our approach, we were able to closely match the apparent speed in degrees per second traveled by the object between the two photographs taken by one of the pilots,\u201d the scientists wrote.\n\nThe team hopes that their work demonstrates a plan that could plausibly \u201cwarn aviators and the public about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations,\u201d and therefore support aviation safety, they wrote. In the future, it\u2019s worth studying how the deployment of a satellite\u2014as well as its surface materials\u2014affects the way it reflects sunlight, the paper adds. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said on X that the satellite orientation could be adjusted to minimize solar reflection during astronomical experiments, though the team\u2019s paper does not specifically address this possibility.\n\nThe authors do suggest various procedures and technologies that aircraft could deploy to support accurate UAP identification. For example, pilots should be allowed to \u201croutinely provide photographic evidence from either an automated system when they are busy with safety critical aircraft operations, or using cell phones when they are not allowed,\u201d to greatly improve UAP analysis.\n\nSatellite operators should also provide information about satellite movements\u2014such as orientation, orbit location, and deployment timelines\u2014to support more accurate and detailed models, the scientists write. Finally, they suggest a way for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reduce in-flight risks due to pilots trying to determine the source of a UAP. Air traffic controllers could have access to a satellite-modeling system that would enable them to anticipate satellite sightings and alert the pilots when necessary. \u201cWe envision this as a collaborative effort between the satellite\u2019s owners (in this case SpaceX/Starlink), the FAA, NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Space Force,\u201d the authors note.\n\nAs for people on the ground, anyone can find Starlink in the sky. Look up on a clear, dark night, and if you see a white light or \u201ctrain\u201d of lights moving across the sky, go to FindStarlink.com. You can search for your time and location and determine if what you see is indeed Starlink satellites."

            "article_content": "If you gotta go fast, you probably don't want to be a stubby-legged spearman who climbs every ladder like a geriatric walrus. Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at Awesome Games Done Quick. The UFO 50 speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection.\n\nBarbuta itself was completed in 4 minutes 55 seconds by player \"GrayGooGlitch\". It's only 11 seconds short of the fastest existing run. The unrepentantly obscure game is full of old-school trickery, like specific pools of toxic slime that won't hurt you, walls that secretly lack collision, and spike pitfalls with invisible bridges. But it's the randomly fluttering bats that give players the most trouble, as they did here just moments into the run.\n\nBut the UFO 50 marathon was also a team effort. Three other players zipped through their own game choices in the allotted time, swapping the controller just like in the good old days of losing a life to a hateful chicken. The next game was Rakshasa, a tough-as-old-boots action game with lots of upsetting frogs. The runner polished it off in 8 minutes and 22 seconds. Then came Night Manor, a point and click horror game with a ton of classical item puzzling but with a killer that follows you through the rooms and will come hunting you if you make noise by doing certain actions like activating a jukebox. They got through that in 6 minutes 20 seconds.\n\nFinally, it was Warptank, a kind of anti-platformer about a nippy space tank that can't jump but can teleblorp to the surface immediately above it. When I played it for our UFO 50 review, each screen was both a fight with the pixel enemies and a puzzle to figure out. When runner \"SpootyBiscuit\" plays, he turns it into a rhythmic waltz of warping, sparking off forty-five degree angles and blasting troublesome worms with ease. It was the toughest game to get through, with a time of 28 minutes 27 seconds.\n\nOverall, it's a nifty showcase of the retro-styled games contained within UFO 50, all of which contain some twist inspired by modern game design. Awesome Games Done Quick began at the weekend and runs until this Sunday. Other recent speedruns include a blast through Rain World: Downpour, but we're still waiting on the player who intends to beat Elden Ring bosses with nothing but his saxophone and a jazzy attitude. That's happening on Thursday. I look forward to it."

            "article_content": "George Clinton\u2019s real UFO encounters: \u201cIf you ain\u2019t got no booty, what do you shake?\u201d\n\nPeople weren\u2019t meant to be this informed all the time. It\u2019s quite literally not natural for us to know this much information and have such a big-picture view of the world. For most of us, we have to focus on what we ourselves can change for the sake of our own mental health. Having too much of a big-picture view of the world will only stress us out. That said, we could go the George Clinton way, take the big picture to such a degree that we all become one, and see just how ludicrous it is to care about our petty differences.\n\nClinton sums this up best in an interview with Rolling Stone. When asked about white artists performing Black music, he is fairly supportive of the idea: \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to learn from each other, blend from each other, and it moves around like that.\u201d So far, so down to earth. Suddenly, that figurative statement becomes literal in the funniest way possible.\n\nAdding, \u201cWe gonna be dealing with aliens. You think Black and white gonna be a problem? Wait till you start running into motherfuckers with three of four dicks!\u201d\n\nA good point well made, George. You see, Clinton didn\u2019t just use the whole sci-fi/afrofuturism vibe of Parliament/Funkadelic as an image. He\u2019s all in on the idea of life beyond the stars because, if you ask him about it, he\u2019s met them in person.\n\nHe goes on to talk about an alien encounter he had with bass icon Bootsy Collins. Right from the off, he answers the question that all of us would have and says, \u201cWe weren\u2019t high.\u201d He says the two of them were driving together after a morning fishing trip, and at around midday, \u201cA light hit the car, and a substance like mercury out of the thermometer rolled up the side of the car.\u201d\n\nIn a further interview with the YouTube channel Nowness, he expanded on what happened next: \u201cWe just drove up to my house\u2026 my daughter came outside and said to us, \u2018Y\u2019all look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u2019\u201d Then it gets really weird. Years later, he recalled that, shortly after they got back, his daughter \u201cwas talking about going to bed. We\u2019d (gone fishing) around 9:30 or 10 in the morning. Why would she be going to bed? Time was amiss; we\u2019d never even contemplated the time being missing.\u201d\n\nIn the same conversation, he goes on to talk about how rather than these visitors being invaders or colonisers, he likes to believe they\u2019re our ancestors. That they\u2019re a shared part of our DNA that can help bring us together. Which is the core of all this. For all his talk about out-there concepts we\u2019d normally find in sci-fi films, to him, this is about us realising all that we have in common.\n\nIt makes no sense to discuss the concept of \u2018white music\u2019 and \u2018Black music\u2019 when it should be all about how much we, as humans, can connect with each other. It\u2019s a charming thought, one put best later in the same interview. When asked what he\u2019d like to say to these aliens if given the chance, he says he\u2019d like to ask, \u201cHow do y\u2019all dance? If you ain\u2019t got no booty, what do you shake?\u201d\n\nReal talk, it\u2019s a question we could do a whole lot of good by asking each other first."

After investigating, which usually consists of staying a night in the so-called \"haunted houses\" Sanders then videos of the experience onto his Youtube channel, which can be found through the social media handle: CLS Paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I have a friend who lives out here and I came out here to visit him. I actually drove from Arizona and he asked me, because he watches my show, if I wanted to do a couple ghost hunts out here. I was sure that Lockport was rich and full of history, so we did some research and talked to some people and we've done quite a few places,\" Sanders said.\n\nSo far Sander's visited such spots like Marjim Manor, Van Horn Mansion, Cold Springs Cemetery, Dunkirk Lighthouse and Stooges, the old City Hall.\n\nSanders said he has plans to visit even more ghostly sites, including Graestone Manor in Gasport.\n\nWhile the ghosts in Lockport seem more \"intrigued\" by him than \"aggressive\" Sanders said that was fine with him. He's still testing new ground in the world of the paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Some of these places I've done have never been investigated by anybody before. I think they're more intrigued here than aggressive, unlike the places I've been on the West Coast. Those are used to tourism because some of those places out west are mainstream ghost hunting places. Here in Lockport that's not the case,\" he said.\n\nSanders began his own ghost hunting with a curiosity of what's unknown \u2014 the big questions like \"what happens when we die?\" \u2014 as well as a drive to find out for himself. There's millions of ghost hunting shows out there, Sanders said. He wanted to see if it was real.\n\nUsing a wide variety of tools, including \"spirit dice,\" as well as white noise boxes and light-up \"rem pods\" that he buys online, Sanders said that depending on the intelligence of the ghost he's trying to communicate with, different kinds of equipment are used.\n\n\"You usually run into a residual haunting or an intelligent haunting and typically an intelligent haunting can give you intelligent conversation through some of the equipment,\" he said. \"A residual haunting is supposedly a spirit that's almost stuck in a time loop and the spirit is not able to communicate, but we are able to pick up the presence of spirit.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, to even get close to the ghosts, Sanders said he has to get permission. Which can be a strange thing to ask. Such was the case of the old City Hall, now Stooges restaurant.\n\n\"I walked through the front door and I could feel the sensation of some sort of activity there and I walked up to the girls who were working at the front counter \u2014 and sometimes its a very awkward question to ask about the paranormal \u2014but I asked them. I said, 'I have an odd question for you, is this place haunted?' They all started laughing,\" he said.\n\nAs it turns out, after investigating, there was no \"concrete evidence\" of intelligence hauntings in Stooges, but Sanders was able to get evidence of \"something\" in the attic.\n\n\"We set a device upstairs in the attic, in which most of the activity, from the employees and the people that have been in there eating have said they heard. That was the only place I was able to get any concrete evidence of something up there,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther places were a little more spooky, including the house in Cold Springs Cemetery. There, Sanders was unable to get responses, but one of his friends, a camera woman named Jen Craft, was able to get answers from children that were haunting the second floor.\n\n\"She was getting intelligent responses through the devices we were using, confirming there were children upstairs in the Cold Springs Cemetery house,\" Sanders said.\n\nSanders said he intends to stay in the area until May and he and his friends will be checking out everything \"haunted\" in the meantime.\n\n\"I will be discussing with the group on dates, holidays and when they're off (for more ghost hunting trips),\" he said."

            "article_content": "panida wijitpanya/Istockphoto\n\nTop 10 Psychic and Medium Related TV Shows\n\nIs there life after death? TV shows about mediums, who have the intuitive gift of being able to psychically connect with the deceased, have become increasingly popular, as more people open up to the belief that spirits do live on after death.\n\nAs studies have shown communication with those who have passed away is possible, it\u2019s not surprising that more people are seeking mediumship services on popular psychic platforms.\n\nTurn these shows into reality by connecting with your medium through one of these trusted online psychic reading sites.\n\nNew York Live/Youtube\n\n1. The Long Island Medium\n\nThe Long Island Medium stars Theresa Caputo, who is known for walking right up to strangers to pass along messages from departed loved ones. From the grocery store to restaurants, Caputo is attuned to the spiritual realm and in service to bridging the realms of the living and deceased. The spontaneity of her approach leads to candid responses of those who are on the receiving end of the information she is sharing. (Although some of the best online psychic readings can be just as interesting and revealing!)\n\nCaputo has become one of the most well-known reality TV psychics. Due to the popularity of this show, TLC produced 14 seasons between 2011 and 2019. The high-energy and unconventional approach of Caputo makes this show top-notch entertainment.\n\nE! Entertainment/ Youtube\n\n2. Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry\n\nHollywood Medium with Tyler Henry chronicles the readings of clairvoyant medium Tyler Henry Koelewyn, who discovered his intuitive gifts at age 10. He started filming this TV series in 2016, when he was only 19 years old. Tyler Henry\u2019s popularity grew after he appeared on Keeping Up with the Kardashians to do a mediumship reading for the sisters. E! offered Tyler Henry the opportunity to do his own show. It was a hit from the get-go, and ended up running for 4 seasons until 2019.\n\nThe show documents Tyler Henry doing readings for A-List celebrities, such as Carmen Electra, Chad Michael Murray, Megan Fox, Bobby Brown, Kristin Cavallari, and many more. What\u2019s unique about this show is the glimpse it offers into celebrities\u2019 personal lives as they open up about their deceased loved ones.\n\nLifetime/Youtube\n\n3. Seatbelt Psychic\n\nRiffing off popular shows such as Cash Cab and Carpool Karaoke, Seatbelt Psychic features medium Thomas John picking up strangers and relaying messages from departed loved ones. John\u2019s goal is to touch the lives of as many people as possible, trusting he\u2019ll cross paths with the people he\u2019s meant to meet, so this on-the-move show is perfect for his mission.\n\nUnfortunately, it only aired one season in 2018 on Lifetime before being canceled. However, the unscripted nature of the show has gone a long way in convincing skeptics and nonbelievers of the validity of mediumship messages. John\u2019s personal messages are often exactly what his passengers needed to hear to gain clarity and release. If you\u2019re curious whether a loved one on the other side might have something to say to you, the personal face-to-face mediumship readings on Keen are a great way to find out.\n\nA&E/Youtube\n\n4. Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal\n\nChildren tend to have a stronger connection to the other side, hence imaginary friends and seeing things in the closet adults can\u2019t. Psychic Kids: Children of the Paranormal explores the unique abilities of children with reported psychic ability and connects them with adult psychic mediums to help cultivate their gifts.\n\nThis show ran on A&E for three seasons from 2008 to 2010 and then had a reboot season in 2019. What sets this show apart from others is the special focus on psychically gifted children. Plus, all hosts of the show, Chip Coffey, Chris Flemming, and Kim Russo, are well-known in the paranormal scene. The fourth host, Edy Nathan is a licensed therapist, who ensures the children are integrating and processing their experiences in a healthy way. For anyone who\u2019s ever had to comfort a child who thinks they\u2019ve seen something in the dark, this is a great show to learn from.\n\nChalabala/Istockphoto\n\n5. Pet Psychic\n\nPets quickly become valued family members, and their passing is often just as painful. The Pet Psychic features medium Sonya Fitzpatrick telepathically communicating with animals. From cats and dogs to horses and birds, Fitzpatrick uses her special gift to share messages with pet owners. (And some of the best online psychic readings can also help you connect with your furry friends.)\n\nThis show ran for three seasons from 2002 to 2004 on Animal Planet. What was unique about this show is that she\u2019s not only communicating with deceased pets but also speaking with living animals to help them with emotional trauma and behavioral problems. If this sounds interesting, consider a reading with an expert pet psychic about your own beloved animal.\n\nPrime videos\n\n6. America\u2019s Psychic Challenge\n\nAmerica\u2019s Psychic Challenge is a game show in which four contestants compete to see who is America\u2019s top psychic. In this exciting show, contestants must go through a series of tests to prove their psychic abilities. One challenge is finding a man hidden in the trunk of one car out of 50, while another requires them to correctly match five brides and five grooms.\n\nLifetime only produced one season of this show back in 2007, but there\u2019s also Britain's Psychic Challenge to watch if you like this one. This show is fun and a good start for nonbelievers to see the feats psychics are capable of.\n\nIMDb\n\n7. Rescue Medium\n\nRescue Medium showcases international psychics Jackie Dennison and Christine Hamlett in seasons 1 through 3 and Alison Wynne-Ryder in seasons 4 through 7 as they help to guide lost spirits to the next realm. In the show, the psychics make house calls to ask spirits to leave haunted locations. Plenty of paranormal encounters occur throughout the seasons, including possessions, poltergeists, and ghosts that need to be dealt with.\n\nThis show aired on Canada\u2019s W Network from 2006 to 2011, but different seasons have also aired on WE: Women\u2019s Entertainment Network in the United States and Discovery Channel and CBS in the U.K. For those who want to see psychics handle a spooky paranormal activity, Rescue Medium gives an up-close look at real-life ghostbusting.\n\nIMDb\n\n8. Psychic Investigators\n\nWhen cases get cold, sometimes it requires psychic investigation to solve the mystery. Psychic Investigators is a true-crime series in which psychics help to find missing clues, discover new leads, and figure out what really happened at the scene of the crime. Like many other popular true-crime shows, Psychic Investigators draws viewers in with dramatic reconstruction, intriguing crime details, and interviews with key characters.\n\nThis series aired on the True Crime Network from 2006 to 2008. From solving cold case murders from 30 years earlier to locating missing persons, this is the ultimate psychic show to satisfy the detective within.\n\nIMDb\n\n9. Ghost Whisperer\n\nGhost Whisperer, starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, is a supernatural television series about Melinda Gordon, who can speak with earthbound spirits. These spirits need Gordon\u2019s help in order to move on, and she must use her mediumship abilities to relay important information to the living. However, the messages she receives are often confusing, so she must piece together the clues to understand the spirits\u2019 needs.\n\nThe five seasons of this show were aired on CBS from 2006 through 2010. Although it\u2019s a fictional series, Ghost Whisperer does a great job depicting the struggles of mediumship, such as having to decipher unclear communication and carrying the emotional responsibility of imparting significant messages. Love Hewitt does a wonderful job in this role, portraying what it\u2019s like to be a medium with psychic abilities. The show depicts how it can feel more like a curse than a blessing at times to have such unusual gifts.\n\nIMDb\n\n10. Medium\n\nMedium is a paranormal drama about the character Allison DuBois, played by Patricia Arquette, who can speak with the deceased, foresee the future, and witness past events in her dreams. When interning as an assistant for a Phoenix District Attorney, DuBois has a dream about a murder, which leads to the successful solving of the case. The seven seasons are centered on DuBois using her psychic gifts to solve cases, convincing nonbelievers of her gift, and living her life as a wife and mother of three.\n\nThe show had 7 seasons between 2005 and 2011 - the first 5 on NBC, and the rest on CBS. Even though this is a fictional show, it has a fantastic plotline that gives viewers a glimpse into the life of a psychic. DuBois is a relatable character, and it\u2019s rewarding to follow along with her psychic journey.\n\nmiriam-doerr/Istockphoto\n\nExploring the Psychic World\n\nFrom providing guidance in the time of loss or crisis to solving cold-case crimes, these shows demonstrate there\u2019s such a wide range of services that psychics can provide. If you\u2019re interested in speaking with a psychic yourself, check out this list comparing the top ten psychic service platforms. The comparisons will assist you in connecting with the perfect psychic for you.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Top10.com and was syndicated by MediaFeed.org\n\nPerseomed /Istockphoto\n\nMore from MediaFeed"

            "article_content": "Part of what makes The Sims 4 such an enduring favorite among cozy gamers is that the options for how to play are basically endless. For some, it\u2019s all about Create a Sim, while others spend hours building their dream house in Build Mode. And then, there\u2019s always those generational challenges, carefully crafted a legacy family with specific rules and specifications. But it\u2019s not just Simmers who have endless options in The Sims 4. Their Sims have a true wealth of options when it comes to their chosen career, and some are better than others.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nFor those who have the game fully loaded with Expansion Packs, there are over 50 career options in The Sims 4. While some are part-time ways for teenage Sims to earn a few Simoleons, many are in-depth adventures up the career ladder to the covered Career Level 10. But which Sims 4 careers are the very best? Based on their depth and engagement, these 10 top the list.\n\n1. Reaper\n\nA Reaper gets to work in The Sims 4 Life & Death\n\nExpansion: Life & Death\n\nThe Reaper career is the newest addition to The Sims 4, and it shows. This career brings everything gamers love about Active careers, while polishing up some of the issues that earlier careers bring into play. Starting as a Grimtern and working their way up, Sims in this career field learn to reap souls and comfort the beloved they\u2019ve left behind.\n\nDoes it get a little bit repetitive eventually? Yes. But there are a good variety of daily tasks and showing up to work with The Grim Reaper himself never quite gets old.\n\n2. Detective\n\nClose the case in Sims 4: Get to Work\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nAn oldie but still a goodie, the Detective career was one of the first Active options in The Sims 4. In this job, Sims spend each day collecting clues to solve cases \u2013 with the active help of the big gamer in the sky, of course.\n\nThis is quite an involved career, with players engaged in tasks like visiting crime scenes and interrogating suspects. For those looking to feel involved in their Sims\u2019 career paths, it\u2019s a must.\n\n3. Doctor\n\nScanning patients is part of a day\u2019s work in The Sims 4 doctor career\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nAnother entry from the original trio of Active careers is the Doctor role. Starting with patient intake and cleaning a lot of hospital beds, Sims work their way up to diagnosing and treating patients over time.\n\nThe tasks for this career can get repetitive once you reach the higher ranks, but it\u2019s nearly always entertaining. It\u2019s also hard work, with many steps to diagnose each patient before the day is done. Unfortunately, the Doctor career remains glitchy to this day, but that doesn\u2019t fully remove its charm.\n\n4. Freelancer\n\nFreelance candlemaking is a thing in Eco Lifestyle\n\nExpansion: Base Game, with more options from packs like Paranormal Stuff and Eco Lifestyle\n\nJust like in real life, the Freelancer career comes with its pros and minuses in The Sims 4. Your Sim will sign up with a specific agency based on their skills, from becoming a Freelance Writer, Crafter, or Artist down to investigating the Paranormal.\n\nThe Freelancer career can be glitchy, but when it works, it\u2019s very engaging. Sims will accept and complete gigs, with increasingly high-paid options as they successfully finish prior jobs. Ticking off the tasks can keep gamers engaged far more successfully than heading to the office for an Active career.\n\n5. Actor\n\nPut on a show as a Sims 4 actor\n\nExpansion: Get Famous\n\nFor Sims who dream of the spotlight, the Actor career offers an opportunity to rise through the ranks from one-off commercial gigs to their own feature film. Added three years after the initial introduction of Active careers, the Actor profession does away with some of the issues from earlier iterations.\n\nOn-the-job tasks include getting hair and makeup done, getting to know co-stars and the crew, and rehearsing lines before finally filming some scenes. This career offers some flexibility as players can choose which acting gigs their Sim takes on, making it a more dynamic option than straightforward ladder-climbing careers.\n\n6. Interior Decorator\n\nShowing off swatches as a Sims 4 interior decorator\n\nExpansion: Dream Home Decorator\n\nFor those Simmers who spend more time in Build Mode than anywhere else, this is the Active career to go for. As an Interior Decorator, Sims will get to step inside homes around town, remodeling them with new decor and furniture.\n\nThe gameplay for this career involves listening to clients and then getting into the Build Mode nitty gritty to bring them to life. While there isn\u2019t as much variety here as with some other Active careers, it\u2019s a great choice for those who treat The Sims 4 like an interior decorating game anyway.\n\n7. Video Game Streamer\n\nGaming for fun and profit in The Sims 4\n\nExpansion: High School Years\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the inception of it all, but there are few things quite as entertaining as having a Sim get really into gaming. The High School Years expansion added a new part-time career that reflects the reality of streaming as a way to make a living in the modern era.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t as dynamic as an Active career or as in-depth as a full-time profession, the Video Game Streamer job is just a ton of fun. Sims raise that video gaming skill and spend time streaming, earning money through tips from fans and learning the ropes for the Entrepreneurial skill. Whether it\u2019s a gateway to a longer-term Freelance career or your Sim\u2019s supplement during college, this part-time job is one of the best.\n\n8. Culinary\n\nEven home chefs know how to hustle in Sims 4\n\nExpansion: Base Game\n\nSome Simmers are in it for the cooking, as the constant stream of new cooking-centered content for The Sims 4 can attest. The Culinary career has been around from the beginning, but it\u2019s still one of the best thanks to the constant addition of new recipes and ways to prep food.\n\nThe Culinary career isn\u2019t an active one, but players will spend plenty of time cooking or mixing drinks for the daily tasks. With so many recipes to choose from and the recently expanded array of kitchen gadgets, Simmers can really get a lot out of this career even if they\u2019re only with their Sims at home.\n\n9. Business Owner\n\nSell clothes, cupcakes, and more in The Sims 4: Get to Work\n\nExpansion: Get to Work\n\nOwning a business doesn\u2019t always work as EA intended, but it\u2019s still one of the most interesting ways to deeply engage with the work element of The Sims 4. Sims can own a variety of business lots, from retail to bakeries and food carts and beyond.\n\nRunning these businesses is a full-on process, from buying or building the lot to creating and selling merchandise. Set prices, engage with customers, and get ready to earn\u2026 or not. This way of bringing in Simoleons is a bit like owning a real business and will take over the day-to-day, but some Simmers like it that way.\n\n10. Landlord\n\nCollecting rent in The Sims 4 Landlord career\n\nExpansion: For Rent\n\nOpinions on The Sims 4: For Rent are a bit mixed, but the ability to buy Residential Rentals and become a landlord is one of the best things the game offers. It\u2019s incredibly dynamic, with the ability to fill an owned unit with tenants, create house rules, and more.\n\nAs a Property Manager, players enjoy a variety of interactions that let them engage with their tenants, including asking about the living conditions and evicting them. Notifications will bring in various issues that Sims need to manage in their units, keeping gamers on their toes \u2013 sometimes a little too much."

Though we're immediately sympathetic towards Jack for the loss of his wife as outlined at the start of the movie, it also quickly becomes clear that there's more to Jack than meets the eye, the full extent of which isn't revealed until the end. But Dastmalchian does a remarkable job of making Delroy at once a sly parody of '70s talk show hosts and a nuanced, tricky character whose pursuit of fame and success ultimately ends up being his undoing - as it so often is.\n\nGiven his history of playing weirdos, creepers, and degenerates, David Dastmalchian certainly isn't the first actor you'd think of to play a chirpy talk show host, and yet he absolutely knocks it out of the park."

            "article_content": "Images taken by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope\n\nAstronomers have achieved a groundbreaking feat after identifying 44 individual stars in a galaxy nearly 6.5 billion light-years away. This remarkable discovery, made possible by NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope and the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, sets a new record for the largest number of individual stars detected in the distant universe. The findings, led by Fengwu Sun, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Astrophysics by Harvard & Smithsonian, and published in Nature Astronomy, open new avenues for studying the universe\u2019s most profound mysteries, including dark matter. Looking for individual stars in galaxies billions of light-years away has long been considered impossible, as these far-flung galaxies typically blur into a diffuse glow.\n\nHowever, a natural magnification effect called gravitational lensing, coupled with JWST\u2019s infrared capabilities, has changed the game, Phys.org reports.\n\nGravitational lensing occurs when a massive object, such as a galaxy cluster, bends and amplifies the light of objects behind it. In this case, the cluster Abell 370 acted as a lens, magnifying a galaxy called the Dragon Arc. This effect stretched the Dragon Arc into an elongated shape, making individual stars within it visible to JWST\u2019s sensitive instruments. \u201cWhen we processed the data, we realized that what appeared to be individual star points were actually stars within this distant galaxy,\u201d said Sun. Many of the stars identified in the Dragon Arc are red supergiants, a type of massive star in the final stages of its life. These stars, cooler and more luminous than the blue supergiants often observed in earlier studies, were detectable thanks to JWST\u2019s ability to observe infrared wavelengths. This marks a shift from earlier discoveries with the Hubble Space Telescope, which had identified only a handful of stars in distant galaxies, most of them blue supergiants like Rigel and Deneb. \u201cWe now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously beyond our reach,\u201d said Sun. \u201cThis discovery provides unprecedented insights into stellar populations and their role in galaxy evolution during the early universe.\u201d\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope was able to capture images of individual stars on the Abell 370\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "The Western Ghats and Northeast India has always been recognized as biodiversity rich and hotspots in India with multiple discoveries of endemic species from these regions, according to a Mongabay-India (MI) report.\n\nIn 2024 too, multiple species were newly described, most of them reptiles, amphibians or insects. Every new discovery is significant as it potentially redefines the course of science and takes us a step closer to the understanding of biodiversity and its conservation and management, says the MI report.\n\nSome of these new species have been highlighted in the report. The king cobra was long believed to be a single species \u2013 Ophiophagus hannah. The longest venomous snake in the world is not considered to have much conservation significance and is listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened taxa. That is about to change as a global study led by the Western Ghats-based scientist P Gowri Shankar has questioned the belief through a new discovery that the king cobra is not one species, but four distinct species separated by geographies. Among the four, two species are severely threatened, including the Western Ghats species, now named Ophiophagus kaalinga. The latest study findings that king cobra is not one, but four species have implications on both conservation and antivenom research.\n\nWhen the species in question is as common as a lizard, the MI report points out how amphibian researcher Sandeep Das nearly missed identifying a new species because it closely resembled the widely known Agasthyagama bedomii, or northern kangaroo lizard. However, after consulting with other experts, he realised that the location of the sighting \u2013 a hilly district in Idukki, Kerala \u2013 was too far from the typical range of A. bedomii. Further studies confirmed this finding, leading to the discovery of a previously unrecognised species. Named Agasthyagama edge, the authors describe the species as \u201csuperficially similar to Agasthyagama bedomii in overall shape, size and colour but can be distinguished by combination of characters.\n\nThe northeastern parts of India, as diverse in animal and plant species as the Western Ghats, are relatively less studied, primarily due to the mostly hostile terrain and turbulence the region has witnessed historically. Despite these challenges, many researchers have managed to do some intense species studies in the region. For Mongabay India, the year 2024 began with the news of three new frog species \u2014 Gracixalus patkaiensis, Alcalus fontinalis, and Nidirana noadihing \u2014 discovered from the biodiversity hotspot of Kamlang-Namdapha landscape in Arunachal Pradesh. Tucked between Myanmar and India, Namdapha is considered the northernmost limit of the tropical rainforest in the world. Namdapha region, located on the border, faces many anthropogenic pressures that pose conservation challenges. Another reason why these discoveries are special is because those are not just three new species but three new genera \u2013 a taxonomic category comprising species exhibiting similar characteristics \u2013 recorded from India.\n\nThe MI report then adds that in 2017, field entomologist Vivek Sarkar and his assistant Tushar Sangma identified a new cicada species during an acoustic survey in Balpakram National Park, located in South Garo Hills, Meghalaya in 2017, leading to the identification of Becquartina bicolor, the bicolour butterfly cicada. In 2020, Rodeson Thangkhiew \u2013 then a PhD scholar and now an assistant professor of zoology at the University of Science and Technology in Meghalaya \u2013 was drawn to a unique cicada call coming from a tree next to a small stream. His observations would later align with Sarkar\u2019s findings. The two teams published their research in March 2024 in Zootaxa. Sarkar emphasised that the locals in South Garo Hills and Ri Bhoi were already familiar with the bicolour butterfly cicada, underscoring the importance of integrating traditional ecological knowledge from local communities into scientific research.\n\nQuite recently, another MI report while highlighting the importance of dung beetles in maintaining environmental health, also informed about the discovery of new dung beetle species, two of which are from northeast India. One of the important lessons from these new discoveries is the extent of biodiversity the country holds. These new findings have far-reaching impacts on conservation science: every new discovery is a step closer to our understanding of biodiversity and its conservation and management."

            "article_content": "Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering microRNAs and their role in controlling gene expression. This pioneering discovery was made using the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. This 1-mm long, slender, and transparent nematode has been the star of many pathbreaking discoveries in biology, four of which have won Nobel Prizes.\n\nHow did C. elegans, a tiny invertebrate, become such a crucial tool for biological research? What insights did this worm yield? What is the value of such research for society when one can argue that our focus should be on studying human biology?\n\nThis is the story of C. elegans. In brief, advances necessary for human health and welfare often arise from solving fundamental biological problems. One major difficulty isn\u2019t just finding the right question to ask but also finding the right place to ask it where it can be solved. C. elegans provides exactly such a setting: a relatively simple but versatile model for biological investigations whose results often reveal general principles that remain valid or have parallels in other organisms, including humans. The worm\u2019s story also highlights how breakthroughs can arise from research driven by curiosity.\n\nHumble beginnings\n\nIn 1963, biologist Sydney Brenner wrote to his peer Max Perutz his thoughts on research in the fields of development and neurobiology. He believed that, as the nature of problems in these areas wasn\u2019t clearly defined, there was a gap in identifying the right experimental approach that would lead to \u201cdefining unitary steps of any given process\u201d.\n\nBrenner suggested the use of genetic analysis in defining such unitary steps in both animal development and the nervous system. He also indicated his choice of using a metazoan organism, which was likely to be the roundworm Caenorhabditis briggsae. But Brenner later chose the nematode C. elegans, a close relative of C. briggsae, for a number of reasons such as its small size, short life cycle (~3.5 days), small genome, transparent body, and its small number of 302 neurons \u2014 unlike the billions of neurons in the human brain. Additionally, C. elegans has several organ systems akin to those found in humans, allowing a chance to identify principles in development.\n\nEllsworth Dougherty was among the early scientists to realise and use the potential of free-living nematodes in genetics research. In 1963, Brenner requested Dougherty for a culture of C. elegans and also sought his guidance on its growth conditions. This collaboration sowed the seeds for building a community that shared resources and collectively contributed to advancing biology research. This culture of sharing resources and unpublished information continues to this day.\n\nCell death\n\nBrenner shared the 2002 Nobel Prize for medicine with H. Robert Horvitz and John Sulston \u201cfor their discoveries concerning genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death\u201d. In his award ceremony, Brenner said, \u201cWithout doubt the fourth winner of the Nobel Prize this year is Caenorhabditis elegans: it deserves all of the honour but, of course, it will not be able to share the monetary award\u201d.\n\nBrenner established C. elegans as a genetic model and demonstrated that genes in the wormcould be mutated, resulting in observable changes in development and behaviour.\n\nExtending Brenner\u2019s work, Sulston in 1976 elucidated the cell lineage of C. elegans, which is the developmental history of all cells of this nematode. He tracked cell divisions from the fertilised single cell to the final 959 cells in the adult organism. This was possible because of the transparency of the worm, but nonetheless was a daunting task.\n\nWhile mapping the lineage, Sulston observed that some cells of a lineage died at specific time points during the normal development of a healthy worm. He showed that precisely 131 of the 1,090 cells born died during development and that cell death was genetically controlled. He described the steps involved in programmed cell death, where healthy cells killed themselves. He also identified a gene responsible for degrading the DNA of the dying cells.\n\nThe genes required for the initial steps of programmed cell death were still unknown. Horvitz continued to identify genes essential for cell death and genes that prevented cell death through mutant generation followed by genetic analyses. He found that the process of cell death arose from interactions among key genes and followed a specific molecular pathway.\n\nHis team\u2019s work in C. elegans showed that many genes involved in cell death also have counterparts in humans. Research in C. elegans was particularly important in advancing understanding of the role of programmed cell death in human development, e.g. of fingers and the nervous system as well as in some cancers.\n\nAgeing and genome sequencing\n\nWork in C. elegans also led to an understanding of the pathways that regulate ageing. The early work from Michael Klass, Tom Johnson, and Cynthia Kenyon in the 1980s and 1990s identified some of the genes leading to longer lifespan than seen in normal worms. Further work in this direction led to the appreciation of the role of insulin signaling pathways in ageing. The insulin signaling pathway plays the same role in ageing in flies and mice and is associated with longevity in humans. This has led to C. elegans being used as a key model for discovering the molecular mechanisms of ageing and as a test bed for drugs that might influence this process.\n\nThe genome information of any organism is invaluable in linking phenotypes, i.e. observable characteristics, to a particular gene. Sequencing the C. elegans genome started in 1990 and was an exemplar for the larger Human Genome Project. The whole genome sequence of C. elegans was carried out by a consortium working together across continents. It was led by Robert Waterston at the Genome Sequencing Center at Washington University in the USA and Richard Durbin at the Sanger Centre in the UK.\n\nThe technology and the software tools developed for sequencing the C. elegans genome led the way in achieving the scale and efficiency critical for sequencing of larger genomes. It was debated if human whole-genome sequencing data should be publicly available as private sequencing efforts wished to patent some of the genes. The open sharing of C. elegans data and community feedback on annotation provided a model for the public human genome sequencing effort.\n\nGene silencing\n\nA geneticist\u2019s dream is to control gene expression, which is the ability to turn genes \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018off\u2019 in a controlled manner. The traditional way to begin by finding suitable mutants is often time-consuming.\n\nIn a landmark 1998 paper, Andrew Fire and Craig Mello discovered RNA interference, several of its salient features, and its potential as a major research tool, one that biologists now use every day. Fire and Mello found that in C. elegans, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was more effective at causing uncoordinated movement of the worm than single-stranded RNA. Injecting a small amount of dsRNA could lead to destruction of a much larger amount of the corresponding cellular RNA, suggesting dsRNA was a catalyst for RNA interference.\n\nFor their work, Fire and Mello jointly received the 2006 Nobel Prize for medicine.\n\nThe most common application of RNAi is to reveal genes\u2019 functions. This technology led to efforts for whole genome RNAi in C. elegans, more defined efforts against gene subsets in other organisms, and has become a staple in the biologist\u2019s toolkit to study gene function. The discovery of RNAi also led to technologies for a highly specific approach to gene-silencing that work in all known organisms. They also have applications in therapeutics for cancer and some inherited gene disorders.\n\nGlowing worms\n\nAnother dream of biologists is to track biological processes and gene products in living cells. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) has revolutionised our ability to do this. How this came about is another success story of curiosity-based research.\n\nIt started with Osamu Shimomura, who was trying to understand why jellyfish are fluorescent. He identified bioluminescent proteins like GFP from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria in the 1960s. In the late 1980s, Martin Chalfie learnt of Shimomura\u2019s discovery about jellyfish while listening to a seminar by another scientist and immediately wanted to try using GFP to locate where some important genes were expressed.\n\nUntil then, this effort was labour-intensive and required the organism to be killed. In 1994, Chalfie was able to introduce GFP into live C. elegans. The transparency of the organism meant easy visualisation: he saw green glowing cells when the organism was illuminated by blue light.\n\nGFP was soon widely used in many organisms and cells and has transformed biological research. Together with Roger Tsien\u2019s success in making a \u2018rainbow\u2019 of fluorescent proteins of multiple colours, today scientists can follow multiple processes and proteins simultaneously in a wide variety of organisms.\n\nShimomura, Chalfie, and Tsien received the 2008 Nobel Prize in chemistry for developing GFP.\n\nThe microRNA prize\n\nThe discovery of microRNAs (miRNA) challenged the central dogma, which said RNAs were mere conduits of information, from DNA to proteins. We now know that miRNAs are a class of regulatory molecules that turn off gene expression at the right time and place. This fundamental advance, which won a Nobel Prize in 2024, is another example of an unexpected finding arising from curiosity.\n\nThe story starts with the study of lin-4 and lin-14, two genes with opposing effects on developmental timing in C. elegans. In the 1990s, Victor Ambros was studying the molecular nature of lin-4 and Gary Ruvkun, that of lin-14. Ambros found that lin-4 makes a tiny RNA (later called miRNA) which is itself important for gene function and which doesn\u2019t make protein at all. He and Ruvkun together realised that this miRNA could bind to lin-14.\n\nRuvkun went on to show that the lin-4 miRNA regulates lin-14 by reducing the latter\u2019s protein expression, providing the first demonstration of a regulatory role for a miRNA. Ruvkun also identified let-7, another miRNA that controls developmental timing and is evolutionarily conserved across the animal kingdom.\n\nThe sequenced C. elegans genome, RNAi, and computational approaches together led to the identification of several other miRNA genes. It\u2019s established that gene regulation by miRNAs is an essential process during development and for normal physiological processes of organisms. RNAi and miRNAs use related pathways to make small RNA fragments that control gene expression. As work in this area has exploded, miRNAs have also been shown to activate genes and move between cells. With the expanding role of miRNAs there is recognition of potential applications in diagnostics and therapeutics.\n\nThere are interesting human aspects to this story, including a connection with Indian science. Ambros and Ruvkun both began their work as postdoctoral fellows in the laboratory of Horvitz, the 2002 laureate, and continued to discuss their work when they had their own independent laboratories. They discovered the direct connection of lin-4 miRNA with lin-14 in a late night phone call, when they both read out the gene sequences of lin-4 and lin-14 to each other.\n\nThe mutant gene lin-4 was isolated in the lab of fellow 2002 laureate Sydney Brenner. The variant that Ambros pursued (e912) was isolated by P. Babu, a faculty member at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, who was visiting Brenner. Babu went on to set up the first C. elegans lab in India at the institute.\n\nA prize for neuronal circuits\n\nEven though C. elegans has just 302 neurons, it still exhibits complex behaviour. Thus it offers a promising model to study a nervous system that is simple enough to analyse while still yielding valuable lessons about general principles.\n\nNaturally, a very useful step is to look for a layout of all its neurons. Brenner began such a reconstruction of the C. elegans nervous system with all its connections in the 1970s. It was a formidable challenge, never attempted before. John White, Brenner\u2019s PhD student, set up a computer system for neuron reconstructions from electron micrographs. He stayed on after his PhD to reconstruct the C. elegans connectome \u2014 a map of all neuronal connections \u2014 and published it in a 1984 monograph, \u2018The Mind of the Worm\u2019.\n\nThis was done well before modern technological tools were available and was the first such effort for any organism. To highlight the scale of difficulties: only in the last two years have we built the connectome of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and of a 1 cubic mm chunk of the human brain. The connectome immediately opened the door to questions about how neural circuits function. For example, in the 1980s, Chalfie (the 2008 laureate for GFP) used laser-based neuron-killing experiments to determine the circuit for the escape response to touch.\n\nWe can ask questions more broadly about the relationship between the genetics of neural circuits and behaviour. The answers, when we can find them in specific contexts, are difficult to obtain, extremely complex, and yet vital for our understanding. Cornelia Bargmann won the 2013 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for her research on the olfactory system of C. elegans. The sense of smell is very important for many organisms. C. elegans has a large number of olfactory receptors and uses complex machinery to sense smells, and respond, adapt, and learn.\n\nBargmann conducted a determined assault on this complex problem, achieving remarkable insights in all these aspects by conducting elegant experiments. As a postdoctoral fellow with Horvitz, she identified smell neurons in C. elegans. In her own laboratory, she took a molecular genetic approach and identified proteins involved in sensing odours. Her lab also showed that despite there being a fixed template for sensing attractive and repulsive cues, there was great flexibility in the olfactory circuit, achieved via individual genetic variation as well as the ability to integrate environmental cues.\n\nSeveral of these findings hold true in organisms like mice, with promise for understanding the human brain.\n\nThe worm\u2019s story\n\nC. elegans research was launched by Brenner in the intellectually fertile and exciting environment at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the University of Cambridge. In its early years the programme attracted Chalfie, Fire, Horvitz, Kenyon, Sulston, Waterston, White, and other talented young people. These early researchers and those they trained made major contributions to worm research and, thanks to the universality of biology across organisms, fueled major scientific discoveries. These researchers also built a culture of curiosity-driven science and a community with open scientific exchange.\n\nThere are many thrust areas where C. elegans research continues to make contributions, such as network behaviour of the nervous system, ageing, and the innate immune response. While it is hard to predict where the next major scientific breakthroughs will arise, the C. elegans story illustrates how curiosity can lead to them, with potentially significant lessons for our understanding of nature and benefits for humankind.\n\nRohini Karandikar is a science communicator, educator, and facilitator.

Maximize the Value of Your Affiliate Partnerships!\n\nAs digital marketing has evolved over the last couple of decades, companies have used affiliate marketing to drive traffic to their websites and generate sales. This article will explore how affiliate coupon codes can affect your brand and how Bluepear\u2019s advanced brand protection technology can address the challenges while ensuring fair traffic generation.\n\nUnderstanding the Potential Challenges of Coupon Affiliates\n\n1. The Potential Impact of Coupon Codes on Your Marketing Funnel\n\nThese coupon codes often appeal to existing customers instead of attracting new ones. Usually, those who seek out affiliate coupon codes are already familiar with your brand and are ready to make a purchase. These customers likely had the opportunity to learn about your products through ads, organic searches, word of mouth, or an influencer who is affiliated with your program.\n\nThus, affiliate coupon sites can end up at the bottom of the conversion funnel, which can lead to additional costs for traffic that has already been attracted to your site through other channels.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\n2. Coupon Codes Can Lead to Discount-Seeking Behavior & Lower Cart Values\n\nCoupons incentivize discounts merely by their nature. As with many brands, your goal for offering a deal will likely attract new and repeat customers. However, this can also backfire because it teaches consumers to secure the lowest price possible for the products they want. This can result in reduced average order value (AOV) over time, which can impact profitability. Encouraging a reliance on discounts can be an unintentional consequence of coupon affiliates.\n\n3. Customer Frustrations & the Risk to Brand Reputation\n\nCoupon affiliate programs work to accomplish their own business goals, which is to attract a constant stream of traffic to their own websites. To do this, they scrape all the possible codes and distribute them all, whether they are valid or not. This can lead to customers coming across expired coupon codes, which may create a less favorable experience with your brand.\n\n4. A Lack of Transparency in Coupon Code Distribution\n\nA common problem with affiliate coupon sites is that they often fail to disclose the methods of attracting users to their websites. They may be driving traffic through paid search campaigns, deceptive SEO practices, or unapproved partnerships with other websites and marketing platforms. This lack of clarity can make it more difficult for brands to formulate an effective marketing strategy for their affiliate programs.\n\nAffiliates who don\u2019t disclose their network connections and activities leave many brands in the dark about whether their codes are being used in ways that decrease the value of their brand, if and when violations occur, and what specific affiliates or third-party partners engage in the misuse of these codes. This uncertainty can challenge trust and hinder collaborative relationships between brands and affiliate partners.\n\nHow Bluepear Can Help Brands Track Coupon Affiliates\n\nThough coupon affiliate programs are often seen as a challenge in digital marketing, Bluepear can provide a solution with its brand protection technology. Below is a hypothetical brand, \u201cJam,\u201d to illustrate how Bluepear\u2019s technology helps combat affiliate coupon misuse.\n\nStep 1: Identifying Violations\n\nJam has to establish clear guidelines in its affiliate program terms and conditions. These terms include prohibitions on promotion through coupon codes and brand bidding.\n\nThough the policies clearly outline these guidelines, Jam notices that users access codes after searching ads that feature phrases like \u201c20% off Jam coupon.\u201d\n\nStep 2: Using Bluepear to Detect Coupon Misuse\n\nJam partners with Bluepear, and with their help, they are able to gain visibility into how their coupons are being misused. Bluepear makes this possible through tech-driven features:\n\nFiltering for Coupon Codes\n\nBluepear provides Jam with a platform that includes a coupon code filter, which is built to identify all instances in which the brand\u2019s name is associated with coupon advertisements.\n\nAnalyzing Violations\n\nThe Bluepear platform provides a comprehensive analysis that shows specific violators, including insightful information such as screenshots where search results show the brand\u2019s name and mentioned discounts. The platform also captures landing pages where these instances of misuse are found and the affiliate IDs linked to these actions.\n\nBuilding Evidence\n\nBluepear collects and stores all affiliate violations, helping Jam gather the evidence required to address the issue with their affiliate networks or partners.\n\nStep 3: Taking Action\n\nBeyond identifying and collecting proof of coupon code misuse, Bluepear\u2019s system also includes a feature that will send the affiliate a notification letter with attached evidence. This feature will streamline the process of addressing affiliate program misuse, save Jam precious time, and ensure affiliate accountability.\n\nWhy Choose Bluepear for Protecting Your Brand?\n\nBluepear is proud to offer an all-encompassing solution for managing and monitoring partners participating in \u0430ffiliate programs. Its features will empower your brand to:\n\nIdentify Misuse at Scale\n\nBluepear\u2019s analytic tools will help your team unveil any patterns of voucher misuse among your affiliate partners and networks.\n\nEnforce Compliance with Your Terms & Conditions\n\nThe brand can notify affiliates who violate program terms directly through the Bluepear platform. The brand can attach screenshots or links as proof.\n\nOptimize Traffic Generation\n\nWith increased transparency with traffic sources, your brand can ensure that your affiliate coupon codes are being used by new customers only.\n\nPreserve Your Brand\u2019s Reputation\n\nBluepear\u2019s active monitoring of coupon code misuse will help you address the issues of distribution of codes and maintain your brand\u2019s reputation.\n\nMaximize the Value of Your Affiliate Partnerships!\n\nWhile affiliate coupon codes may appear to be a simple and effective way to boost sales, they can come with challenges, including potential impacts on AOV and brand reputation, which may outweigh the perceived benefits. However, with the help of Bluepear, you can regain control over your affiliate program. Discover how Bluepear\u2019s brand technology can safeguard your brand and optimize your affiliate marketing strategy today.\n\nDigital Trends partners with external contributors.

            "article_content": "Source: Creatista/Shutterstock\n\nThe linguistic contributions Gen Zers brought to our society are officially vintage in the face of Gen Alpha\u2019s influence. Born after 2010, this iPad generation is fluent in a rapidly evolving language that leaves many parents scratching their heads.\n\nWords and phrases that once felt like the cutting edge of cool, like \"lit\" or \"fire,\" are now gathering digital dust. For parents, it feels like the gap between generations has never been wider, as our teens communicate in a code of memes, viral trends, and game references. Parents find themselves asking, \"Is this a curse, a dance move, or a video game boss I should know about?\"\n\nTrying to have a conversation with a Gen Alpha teen can feel like stepping into a never-ending \"Skibidi Toilet\" meme\u2014bizarre, fast-paced, and hard to follow. It\u2019s not just about knowing the words; it\u2019s about understanding the cultural ecosystem those words belong to.\n\nMany parents express frustration, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re not speaking the same language anymore,\u201d or outright dismiss the new slang as being too reductionist, or degenerate. What was once straightforward communication now feels like navigating an inside joke. However, by embracing the nuances of our teens\u2019 worldview, we can begin to bridge the communication gap.\n\nSpeaking Gen Alpha\n\nDescribed by some as \"cringe\" or even \"brain rot,\" this generation\u2019s slang often leaves parents feeling out of the loop, and sometimes downright stupid, as they attempt to decode it. Terms like \"negative aura\" have replaced the familiar Gen Z phrase \"bad vibes,\" and while the meaning may be similar, the shift in language can make parents feel like they\u2019re always a step behind.\n\nTake the word \"sigma,\" for example. To Gen Alpha, calling someone \"sigma\" means they\u2019re cool or a leader. Meanwhile, \"Ohio\" has taken on the meaning of something cringe-worthy or embarrassing. And if your teens say they \"have rizz,\" don\u2019t panic\u2014the word was added to the dictionary in 2023 and just means that they have charm or charisma.\n\nParenting Toward Individuation\n\nAt the heart of every generation\u2019s linguistic evolution is the desire to differentiate themselves from those who came before. Each generation creates new phrases and trends not only to connect with their peers on a deeper level but also to separate themselves from previous generations. This creates a social gap that can make communication with parents feel strained.\n\nThe culture Gen Alpha is creating\u2014through slang, social media trends, and online memes\u2014is a living, breathing expression of their values, humor, worldview, and communication style. It is important to remember that the teenage years are a time of individuation, socialization, and identity formation.\n\nThanks to social media, Gen Alpha slang has evolved more rapidly but still serves the same purpose, which is for adults to not understand. Teens know they are at times annoying their parents, and they mean to. It\u2019s important to allow our teens to have their own language and space to be themselves. While researching the new slang is an option, asking your child what they mean, or reflecting back what you understood, will help your teen feel heard. Curiosity is the most important aspect of parenting; rather than trying to crack the code of Gen Alpha slang, the key is being attuned to their emotions.\n\nFrom Big Sad to Big Happy\n\nAs confusing as Gen Alpha\u2019s communication style may seem, it's important to remember that this is developmentally appropriate and a natural part of the individuation process.\n\nAs parents, we have the privilege of witnessing our children\u2019s identities unfold, and by embracing their unique expressions, we can bridge the generational gap and foster deeper connections."

            "article_content": "National Medal of Science\n\nPrinceton molecular biologist Bonnie Bassler has received the National Medal of Science, the nation\u2019s highest scientific honor. Two emeritus members of the Princeton faculty, Larry Martin Bartels and Ingrid Daubechies, and two undergraduate alumni, John Dabiri and Cynthia Dwork, were also among this year\u2019s 14 recipients of the White House honor, announced and awarded in a ceremony Jan. 3. The ceremony also honored nine individuals with National Medals of Technology and Innovation, the highest honor for technological achievement.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to those recipients of two of our nation\u2019s most prestigious honors, the National Medal of Science and National Medal of Technology and Innovation,\u201d said President Joseph Biden during the livestreamed ceremony. \u201cThis year\u2019s honorees represent a simple truth: As I\u2019ve always believed, America can be defined by a single word, \u2018possibilities.\u2019 That\u2019s who we are, a nation of possibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more delighted for Bonnie and the other medalists from the Princeton family,\u201d said Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber. \u201cBonnie\u2019s groundbreaking discoveries about bacterial messaging have revolutionized our concepts of what molecular communication can be and what a profound role it plays for all life-forms, from the simplest to the most complex.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cAll Princetonians, from our undergraduates through our senior faculty members, are encouraged to take intellectual risks, pursue radical new ideas, follow their curiosity \u2014 and as we see today, that can lead to astonishing accomplishments that fulfill our informal motto, Princeton \u2018in the nation\u2019s service and the service of humanity.\u2019\u201d The ceremony was held in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. Awards were presented by Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and assistant to the president for science and technology.\n\nBonnie L. Bassler\n\nBonnie Bassler and Arati Prabhakar\n\nBassler received the National Medal of Science \u201cfor paving the way to develop novel therapies to combat bacteria,\u201d according to the award citation read at the ceremony. \u201cSpending years in laboratories while sparking the imaginations of students, Bonnie Bassler established bacteria as social organisms with a widespread signaling system for communicating. Her revolutionary research opens a gateway to solving biological puzzles that can save lives.\u201d\n\nFrom her early work confirming how bacteria act in concert, to her growing understanding of the extraordinary webs of microbial messaging among the tiniest life-forms, Bassler has been a pioneer and global leader in the understanding of how bacteria communicate with each other.\n\n\u201cI am delighted and honored to receive the National Medal of Science. I am very proud of and grateful to my lab team,\u201d said Bassler, the Squibb Professor in Molecular Biology and the chair of the Department of Molecular Biology at Princeton University. \u201cThe festivities in D.C. were magical.\n\n\u201cMost moving and memorable to me were the speeches at the ceremony,\u201d Bassler said. \u201cThey were not about a scientist being the best in a field, or the first to make a revolutionary finding, but rather, about the importance of the recipients\u2019 research and mentorship of the next generations of scientists to democracy and to the vitality of and possibilities for the nation now and going forward.\n\n\u201cThat is not how I think of myself or my work on a day-to-day basis,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was both humbling and thrilling for my team\u2019s work to be considered in that realm.\u201d\n\nAmong her many honors, Bassler is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nShe is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and a recipient of Princeton University\u2019s President\u2019s Award for Distinguished Teaching, the Wolf Prize in Chemistry, the Canada Gairdner International Award, the Princess of Asturias Award from the Spanish Crown, the Gruber Prize, the Albany Prize, the L\u2019Or\u00e9al-UNESCO Women in Science Award, and a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant.\u201d\n\nBassler received her B.S. in biochemistry from the University of California-Davis and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLarry Martin Bartels\n\nLarry Martin Bartels and Arati Prabhakar\n\nBartels received the National Medal of Science \u201cfor thought leadership that promotes democracy around the world,\u201d according to his award citation. \u201cLarry Bartels\u2019 study of democratic institutions and analyses of partisanship and voting behavior, economic inequality, and political accountability offer astute insights that have shaped attitudes and call on all of us to protect our sacred democratic principles.\u201d\n\nBartels, Princeton\u2019s Donald E. Stokes Professor in Public and International Affairs, Emeritus, and an emeritus professor of politics, was on the Princeton faculty from 1991 to 2011. On Jan. 1, 2012, he transferred to emeritus status and joined the Department of Political Science at Vanderbilt University.\n\nBartels was the founding director of Princeton\u2019s Center for the Study of Democratic Politics at the School of Public and International Affairs. The center supports empirical research into democratic political processes and institutions.\n\nIt is very rare for a social scientist like Bartels to win the National Medal of Science, noted Christopher Achen, Princeton\u2019s Roger Williams Straus Professor of Social Sciences, Emeritus, and an emeritus professor of politics.\n\n\u201cLarry is widely regarded as the preeminent scholar of American representative democracy,\u201d said Achen, who co-authored \u201cDemocracy for Realists\u201d with Bartels in 2016. \u201cHe has an uncanny ability to use hard evidence to overturn cherished political pieties. A running theme in his work is that elites get their way far more than ordinary people do, even in democracies, but that neither liberals nor conservatives are typically right about how that happens or what to do about it. Thus, we have much hard thinking to do if we are to repair the many broken aspects of our contemporary politics.\u201d\n\nBartels received his B.A. from Yale University in 1978 and his doctorate from the University of California-Berkeley in 1983.\n\nIngrid Daubechies\n\nIngrid Daubechies and Arati Prabhakar\n\nDaubechies won the Medal of Science \u201cfor pioneering discoveries in the development of wavelets,\u201d according to her citation. \u201cA mathematician and physicist, Ingrid Daubechies has transformed the field of signal processing and the way society consumes, utilizes, and optimizes digital images and information, from art to smartphones and MRI machines. A trailblazer and a role model, she empowers women in math and science worldwide.\u201d\n\nDaubechies, Princeton\u2019s emeritus William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Mathematics and Applied and Computational Mathematics, was a member of Princeton\u2019s faculty from 1994 to 2011, during which time she became the first female full professor in the Department of Mathematics. She is now the James B. Duke Distinguished Professor Emerita of Mathematics at Duke University.\n\n\u201cThe astonishing range of Daubechies\u2019 work runs from repairing old master paintings to efficient transmission of signals through the internet,\u201d said Charles Fefferman, Princeton's Herbert E.

            "article_content": "The Webb Space Telescope captured a record-breaking image of stars in the Dragon Arc, a serpentine crescent of a galaxy in the distant universe.\n\nThe galaxy is a whopping 6.5 billion light-years from Earth and Webb\u2019s recent snapshot of it captures 44 individual stars, seen thanks to the telescope\u2019s remarkable capabilities and the fortuitous layout of objects between the telescope and the galaxy. Let us explain.\n\nThe Dragon Arc is just that\u2014a bent strip of light in space\u2014because its light is flattened by the gravity of intervening objects. Those intervening objects are gravitational lenses, which bend and refocus the light from more distant objects, magnifying them to an observer (in this case, the Webb Space Telescope).\n\nLens within a lens\n\nIn a recent study, a group of astronomers scrutinized Webb observations of a galaxy cluster and well-known gravitational lens known as Abell 370. The cluster magnified the distant stars by approximately 100 times, and a star within the cluster acted as a lens within that lens, making the distant stars come into sharper relief. The team\u2019s research describing the target stars was published this week in Nature Astronomy.\n\n\u201cInside the galaxy cluster, there are many stars floating around that are not bound by any galaxy,\u201d said Eiichi Egami, a research professor at Steward Observatory and co-author of the paper, in an Arizona State University release. \u201cWhen one of them happens to pass in front of the background star in the distant galaxy along the line of sight with Earth, it acts as a microlens, in addition to the microlensing effect of the galaxy cluster as a whole.\u201d\n\nNew possibilities\n\nThe lensception, if you will, made it possible for the research team to pick out individual stars which otherwise would have been too fuzzy to make out. The team studied the stars and concluded that \u201cmany of them are consistent with red giants or supergiants magnified by factors of hundreds,\u201d as the group wrote in the paper.\n\n\u201cThis groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\u201d said Fengwu Sun, a researcher at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, in the release.\n\nSuch red stars are nearing the end of their lives. As the stars use up their fuel, they swell and offload reams of gas and dust. Webb is no stranger to such ancient stars; in 2022 and 2023, the state-of-the-art observatory trained its eye on Earendel, the most distant known star, and found signs that the ancient ball of gas may have a partner in crime.\n\nDiscovering a single distant star is remarkable on its own. In November 2024, astronomers captured the first detailed image of a star outside our galaxy\u2014a red supergiant in its final stages of life. But a whole collection of stars is more scientifically useful. As the team wrote, the work demonstrates that \u201cobservations by the Webb Space Telescope could lead to the possibility of conducting statistical studies of high-redshift stars.\u201d\n\nAstronomers will conduct follow-up observations of the arc with the Webb telescope, which are expected to reveal more of the magnified stars within the distorted galaxy. Besides helping scientists understand how different gravitational lenses magnify ancient light, the findings could reveal aspects of dark matter."

            "article_content": "6 Shares Email\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nBy Katerina Stroponiati\n\nThe artificial intelligence landscape is shifting beneath our feet, and 2025 will bring fundamental changes to how enterprises deploy and optimize AI. Drawing from current deployment patterns \u2014 where companies like OpenAI are racing to build supersized data centers to meet the ever-increasing demand for compute power \u2014 three critical infrastructure shifts are reshaping enterprise AI deployment.\n\nHere\u2019s what technical leaders need to know, beyond the hype.\n\nEnglish as the new programming language\n\nThe \u201cnew language\u201d isn\u2019t another Python; it\u2019s English. In 2025, more platforms will empower users without coding experience. These no-code AI tools will allow founders, entrepreneurs and creators to build intelligent systems and services with ease.\n\nInstead of spending months learning a new programming language, individuals can focus on clarity of thought and expression in English, communicating with AI in conversational, natural language. Natural language interfaces are fundamentally restructuring how enterprises architect their AI systems, eliminating a translation layer.\n\nI expect a surge of educational resources, platforms and communities dedicated to teaching the new language of AI interaction. This will go beyond prompt engineering to include building workflows, designing product flows and structuring data \u2014 all without writing code. These educational platforms will be foundational stepping stones for those entering the tech landscape without traditional programming skills.\n\nThe great GPU race: Innovation amid hardware constraints\n\nLarge corporations are fiercely competing to advance GPU and AI hardware innovation. But while they have capital, they face a slow and costly race.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently admitted that a lack of computing capacity is a major barrier to his company\u2019s growth.\n\nBig Tech\u2019s GPU obsession is like gold rush fever, but the winners will be those who learn how to mine computing power efficiently. Startups are nimble and motivated to find efficient, cost-effective alternatives to fuel their AI infrastructure.\n\nStartups will explore creative solutions to sidestep reliance on top-tier GPUs. Efficient GPU-sharing algorithms and decentralized networks that leverage idle computing power are at the forefront of democratizing computing power away from Big Tech. Expect the rise of innovative services enabling pooled or fractional GPU resources, allowing users to \u201crent\u201d or share compute power as needed.\n\nBig companies can afford to spend billions on computing, but real innovation will come from those who must get scrappy.\n\nAI agents will pay each other in crypto\n\nBy the end of 2025, we may enter a world with thousands of AI agents, each excelling at specific tasks. Whether assisting with marketing analytics, legal drafting or personalized education, these agents will perform well-defined functions autonomously and efficiently.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch: These agents will need a way to transact automatically, and traditional payment systems like PayPal weren\u2019t built for autonomous transactions between AI agents.\n\nWith each agent needing to be compensated for services in real-time, cryptocurrency could become the \u201cnative\u201d currency of AI.\n\nThe solution emerging from leading enterprises combines blockchain-based smart contracts with traditional payment rails. These hybrid systems enable instant, secure transactions between agents while maintaining regulatory compliance.\n\nThe technical architecture includes rate-limiting mechanisms, fraud detection systems and automated auditing of agent interactions \u2014 essential features for enterprise deployment. This shift will create opportunities for innovations in decentralized payment solutions, fostering a new era of crypto-driven ecosystems where AI agents can transact, pay each other and form micro-economies.\n\nBlockchain technology is a secure, transparent way for agents to interact, exchange value and establish trust without centralized oversight. This is the missing link that lets agents scale while maintaining a secure network for their interactions.\n\nThese three shifts \u2014 natural language interfaces making technology more accessible, startups innovating around hardware constraints, and AI agents transacting autonomously \u2014 are signals of a new era in AI. Enterprises that recognize and adapt to these changes will be better positioned to leverage AI\u2019s full potential.\n\nKaterina Stroponiati is the founder of Brilliant Minds, pioneering a visionary approach in venture capital by focusing on founders over 50, challenging age-related stigmas in entrepreneurship.

Will he abuse his political power of being co-president, or whatever he calls himself now, to mess with a business competitor? I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll do that. I genuinely don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman once collaborated with Elon Musk to create the artificial intelligence company. While he doesn\u2019t think too fondly of Musk\u2019s future, he did say he doesn\u2019t believe Musk will use his new political influence to target rivals (Getty Images)\n\nMusk and Altman once sought to \u201csave\u201d humanity from the dangers of artificial intelligence through the co-founded company OpenAI \u2013 the parent company of ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, a dispute over the direction of the company, and an internal power struggle, led to a falling out between the two. Musk ultimately left the company in 2018 and has since worked to create his own AI company.\n\nThe battle between Altman and Musk turned publicly nasty last year when Musk filed a lawsuit against the company and Altman claiming he and other executives breached the company\u2019s founding agreement to benefit humanity over profit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk made his feelings about Altman and OpenAI evident in mocking social media posts.\n\nMusk dropped the lawsuit but filed another one against Altman and OpenAI, this time elevating his accusations to claim OpenAI worked with Microsoft, an investor, to create a monopoly. The billionaire also alleged the company violated its founding claim as a nonprofit by pursuing profit.\n\nOpenAI has denied the allegations.\n\nMusk has proven to be a powerful figure in politics thanks to his proximity to President-elect Donald Trump (Getty Images)\n\nIn December, the artificial intelligence company posted a lengthy, accusatory blog post that included screenshots of emails and texts showing Musk agreeing the company should pivot from nonprofit to for-profit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey claimed Musk bitterly left the company after the board refused to make him CEO or agree to his suggestion to merge Tesla and OpenAI. They claim Musk started his artificial intelligence company, xAI, to compete directly with OpenAI.\n\n\u201cHe says a lot of things, starts them, undoes them, gets sued, sues, gets in fights with the government, gets investigated by the government. That\u2019s just Elon being Elon,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg.\n\nBut Altman believes that he and Musk still share a \u201cconviction\u201d that artificial intelligence is important but needs to be handled carefully.\n\nDespite Musk\u2019s close proximity to Trump \u2013 having been named co-chair of the advisory board the Department of Government Efficiency \u2013 Altman does not think Musk would go so far as to use his power to quash a competitor.\n\n\u201cMay turn out to be proven wrong,\u201d Altman added."

            "article_content": "In October, Wall Street celebrated its second year (and counting) in a resounding bull market. While a confluence of factors is responsible for lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to multiple record-closing highs last year, none played a bigger role than the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI gives software and systems the ability to make split-second decisions without the need for human input or intervention. It's a technology that has wide-reaching utility in virtually all industries around the globe.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBut as we've seen from other game-changing technologies and innovations over the last couple of decades, not all early stage risers are necessarily long-term winners. The wide variance observed in price targets for artificial intelligence stocks on Wall Street speaks to this mixed outlook.\n\nBased on low-water price targets issued by select Wall Street analysts, the following three premier AI stocks are expected to plunge by up to 86% in the new year.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Implied downside of 55%\n\nThe first rapidly growing AI stock that at least one Wall Street analyst believes will plummet in 2025 is customizable rack server and storage solutions company Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). According to Mehdi Hosseini or Susquehanna, Supermicro stock is headed for $15 per share, which would equate to a whopping 55% decline, relative to where shares closed on Jan. 3.\n\nOn paper, Supermicro finds itself ideally positioned to take advantage of the AI revolution. Companies are paying big bucks for the data center infrastructure necessary to make split-second decisions, run generative AI solutions, and build/train large language models. In fiscal 2024, Supermicro's net sales surged by 110% to nearly $15 billion.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, Super Micro Computer utilizes Nvidia's ultra-popular graphics processing units (GPUs) in its rack servers. With Nvidia's chips possessing superior computing speed, it's made SuperMicro's servers even more desirable.\n\nBut as you can guess from Hosseini's price target, things haven't gone as planned. In late August, Super Micro Computer was the subject of a research report from noted short-seller Hindenburg Research, which alleged, among other things, \"accounting manipulation.\" Since this report, the company has:\n\nDelayed the filing of its annual report.\n\nHad an early stage probe commenced by federal regulators regarding its accounting practices, per The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHad Ernst & Young resign as the company's auditor.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "While some handheld gaming PC manufacturers are busy cornering the comically large form factor market, Lenovo has slipped in to announce several new - and considerably more portable - devices of its own, including the Legion Go 2 and a handheld utilising SteamOS.\n\nStarting with the Legion Go 2, that's Lenovo's currently still-in-prototype second generation handheld gaming PC, which - alongside its built-in kickstand and ergonomically improved detachable controllers - sports an 8.8-inch OLED display with VRR support, and comes equipped with either the upcoming AMD Ryzen Z2 or Ryzen Z2 Extreme. It can also sport up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD storage, to further boost its beefy credentials.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no hint of a release window or price for the Legion Go 2 just yet, with Lenovo instead choosing to focus its attention on its other newly announced handheld gaming PC: the more modest, and more imminently available, Legion Go S.\n\nA prototype of Lenovo's Legion Go 2. | Image credit: Lenovo\n\nThe Legion Go S offers a sleeker alternative to Lenovo's existing Legion Go, doing away with the former's detachable controllers in favour of a more rounded all-in-one design. It features an 8-inch, 16:10 IPS LCD multi-touch screen (with a 120Hz variable refresh rate and 1920 x 1200 resolution), alongside hall-effect thumbsticks, a redesigned D-pad, and dual stage triggers.\n\nAs for the insides, Legion Go S includes either an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go or Z1 Extreme processor, and can be equipped with up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of SSD. All this lives inside a 299mm x 127.6 x 22.6 shell and weighs upwards of 730g - around 90g heavier than Steam Deck. Lenovo tells The Verge it's targeting two to 2.5 hours of battery life for demanding games.\n\nThe SteamOS version of Lenovo's Legion Go S (the Windows 11 variant is white). | Image credit: Lenovo\n\nLenovo's first Legion Go S model begins shipping this month, costing \u00a3649.99/$729.99 with the Z2 Go processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It'll be followed in May by a slightly lower-specced \u00a3600/$599.99 variant, featuring the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 1TB storage. Both machines utilise Windows 11, but Lenovo is also working on a SteamOS-powered Go S, making it the first authorised third-party handheld gaming device to utilise Valve's operating system. This is the cheapest of the bunch, costing $499.99 with the Z2 Go, 16GB RAM, and 512GB storage - and The Verge reports it should also arrive in May.\n\nFor anyone with an eye on the slightly more distant future, however, Digital Foundry has taken a look at AMD's newly announced trio of next-gen Ryzen Z-series APUs - the kind that'll be packed into Lenovo's second generation Legion Go 2 - if you're curious to learn more."

            "article_content": "Understanding Dell's New Branding\n\nDell's new branding efforts in a nutshell\n\nThe Dell Pro 14 Plus\n\nThe Dell Pro and Pro Max Lineups\n\nDell's Pro Max 14 and 16 Premium\n\nThe step down from Premium to Dell Pro Plus includes 13, 14, and 16-inch models, and comes as either a traditional laptop or a 2-in-1 form factor. Regardless of the size and design, all of these machines use the same BIOS to make life easier for IT departments. Dell Pro Plus notebooks use 50% recycled aluminum shells.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the Dell Pro machines have some design features in common. They all have dedicated HDMI, USB, and Thunderbolt connectivity options. They're also all available with 5G modems for WAN connectivity as well as Wi-Fi 7 for local wireless networks. We also know that other Meteor Lake notebooks feature beastly battery life, and Dell says these will last up to 21 hours away from the wall.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also Dell Pro Desktops coming. These have a variety of form factors including micro, slim desktop, and tower configurations. These have both Intel Core Ultra and AMD Ryzen CPU options, and will be Dell's first commercial desktops with NPUs on board.\n\nDell Pro AI Studio\n\nDell talks in-depth about AI PCs and Dell Pro AI Studio at CES\n\nDell talks in-depth about AI PCs and Dell Pro AI Studio at CES\n\nThe Dell 14 and 16 Plus\n\nThe Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1 is the first consumer notebook with the new branding\n\nBranding efforts are tricky business. Choose an obtuse name and it can be tricky to know what you're even selling. Of course, Dell's branding hasn't fallen into that category, but names like Latitude and Inspiron can be tough to decipher if you're new to PCs. That's why the largest privately-owned PC manufacturer, Dell, not only announced a truckload of new AI PCs at CES, it also rolled out a new series of brands to simplify its product lineup and help consumers understand what they're buying. Meet Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Max.Before we dive too deeply into the names, we want to point out there are lots of PCs coming very soon under these three umbrellas. The first wave of machines are mostly laptops with names that indicate screen sizes. As we go, we'll see things like Dell Pro 13 Premium and Dell 16 Plus, and it will all make sense after understanding the new branding. While the first wave of AI PCs were Snapdragon X1 Elite-based notebooks, these are for the most part x86 notebooks using Lunar Lake CPUs from Intel's Core Ultra 200 series.At first it might appear that Dell has taken iPhone names and applied them to PCs, but it's not quite that simple as there are suffixes that can be applied to each. It's basically three categories of device: Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max. Within each category, suffixes indicate things like build quality and performance tiers. First is the non-suffixed name, which is the base model, and then the Plus is a step-up and Premium is pretty self-explanatory. Understanding it as a 3x3 grid helped this author wrap his brain around it. All the same, a name like Dell Pro Max 16 Premium doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.The Dell branding will encompass everything that targets individual consumers -- fare thee well, Inspiron, Inspiron Plus, and XPS brands. These names have served the company well. However, in 2025 they've been replaced with Dell base models and their suffixed brethren: Dell Plus and Dell Premium.That means folks shopping on Amazon or at Best Buy for a home computer are going to see three brands, just like they have in the past. The names should also be clearer; it's obvious that Dell Plus is better than Dell, while Dell Premium sits on top. And it should be noted that Dell's gaming brand Alienware isn't going anywhere, either. New models in Alienware's lineup were just announced, as a matter of fact.After that are the models targeted at corporate buyers. Dell Pro more-or-less replaces the Latitude brand of business notebooks and desktops. Meanwhile, the high-performance Precision lineup has been dubbed Dell Pro Max. And of course those brands all have their own base, Plus, and Premium branding applied to them. Pretty straightforward, right? Right, so let's move on to the systems themselves.The first machines to roll out under the new branding are, for the most part, Dell Pro and Pro Max PCs. We'll start with the Dell Pro 13 Premium and 14 Premium. As their names imply, they ship with 13 and 14-inch displays with 16:10 aspect ratios and either FHD+ or QHD+ resolutions. Later this year, these notebooks will be available with Tandem OLED displays (first seen on the M4 iPad Pro) for a 24% increase in efficiency and a 49% weight reduction compared to previous OLED designs. The early models will instead come with mini-LED backlit IPS displays.The Dell Pro Premium notebooks are also built upon 90% recycled magnesium frames that keep the weight down to as low as 2.36 pounds. Despite the light weight, these systems meet the MIL-STD H durability spec so they can survive long days in the airport or driving around. These notebooks also have dual-fan cooling systems that the company says keeps them quiet while increasing air flow by 20%. Dell Pro Premium cooling systems will be riding atop Intel Core Ultra 200v-series processors.The same Lunar Lake CPUs which have on-board NPUs that enable Copilot+ features in Windows will also drive Dell Pro AI Studio. This would be easy to dismiss as the company's own take on on-device AI, but it's actually quite a bit more. Dell Pro AI Studio goes a lot farther than just configuring some settings for different workloads, though; Dell Pro AI Studio has its own collection of validated models that have been optimized for the hardware of a Dell Pro PC that can be easily deployed on-device using the Dell Management Portal. This video presentation from Dell goes into much more detail.Of course, all of these features can be done through public repositories like HuggingFace or downloading random repos from different hardware makers on GitHub. However, having all of this collected and (more importantly) validated by the OEM makes getting a useful AI model onto a PC a breeze. This lets Dell Pro users focus on getting work done rather than setting up an environment.Consumer PCs aren't left out of the initial launch of Dell's rebranding efforts. The Dell 14 Plus and 16 Plus will be available as both traditional notebooks and 2-in-1 designs. To start with, these systems will have Intel Core Ultra 200v processors that increase battery life 39% over the previous generation of Inspiron Plus notebooks.Later this year, Dell says it will flesh out the consumer offerings to include desktops and notebooks. There will be options based on not only Intel Core CPUs, but also AMD Ryzen and Qualcomm Snapdragon X series processors as well. As these machines launch and Dell continues with its rebranding efforts, we'll be sure to bring more. For now, you can see more about Dell Pro computers directly from Dell itself."

            "article_content": "It\u2019s a good idea to establish a governance policy supporting the framework. This includes the creation of landing zones, defining the VPN, gateway connections, network policies, storage policies, hosting key services within a private subnet and setting up the right IAM policies (resource policies, setting up the organization, deletion policies). Creating awareness of the policy of least privilege and addressing frustrations when cloud users ask for more to play with, and as a cloud CoE team, you are rightfully holding your ground that comes with it. The cloud CoE team should collect feedback from the users and tweak policies along the way as they deem fit. As the enterprise user community matures through this learning curve, the CoE team has a pivotal role to play in engaging them proactively, supporting them, meeting their needs and helping them address their pain points to lay a strong foundation for building a robust cloud infrastructure that is scalable to deliver business value.\n\nPartnering with the enterprise architecture team in this stage of the cloud journey can speed up cloud maturity and buttress the foundation further on solid bearings. The cloud CoE team of architects should work with the EA to align with the reference architecture patterns that the CoE team would like the application teams/product teams to follow in their solution design. This strategic and collaborative work serves as a blueprint for the architects to \u2018show and tell\u2019 the concept of designing cloud-effective solutions and shape mindsets towards the \u2018making money with the cloud\u2019 vision. Every company that wants to succeed in scaling AI solutions and capabilities today needs to get this design thinking working for them. Otherwise, it\u2019s like the story of \u2018sour grapes\u2019 with high cloud cost bills coming their way with little value added in the AI domain as it has been for a lot of companies in 2024.\n\n3. WALK FASTER: Develop cloud adoption planning and migration roadmap\n\nWith the CoE and EA teams working in tandem, it\u2019s time to engage the business stakeholders/product owners and develop the plan and roadmap. Understanding business constraints and priorities, and evaluating domains that have opportunities to expand their revenue and grow exponentially upon moving to the cloud are the key parameters to keep in mind. I recommend a structured approach for this phase of the journey."

            "article_content": "Recent research from Gartner and IDC paints a sobering picture: Cloud providers are experiencing diminishing returns on their innovation investments. Cloud spending continues to grow, but industry analysts note that the pace of revolutionary new services has significantly slowed.\n\nRemember when cloud providers were dropping game-changing innovations every few months? Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) revolutionized our thoughts about computing resources. Serverless computing eliminated entire categories of operational overhead. Container orchestration transformed application architecture. Those were the glory days of cloud innovation.\n\nInnovation is getting thin\n\nStrip away the AI hype and look at the recent announcements from AWS re:Invent, Microsoft Ignite, or Google Cloud Next. Most improvements are incremental: better VM performance, minor serverless enhancements, and slightly more efficient container management. It\u2019s evolution, not revolution."

            "article_content": "On the night of August 10, 2022, five pilots on two separate commercial airline flights were wholly convinced they\u2019d documented proof of an Unidentified Anomalous Phenomenon (UAP) over the Pacific Ocean. Pilots from both flights reported seeing odd lights zipping through the sky\u2014but the single incident they all witnessed turned out to be Starlink telecommunications satellites.\n\nIn recent years, pilots\u2014as well as the public\u2014have mistakenly identified these low-Earth orbit satellites as UAPs. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of 69 reports just from January 23\u2013April 27, 2023 that identify \u201cUFO-UAP,\u201d and according to one paper , more than a third of them could be Starlink satellites. Unfortunately, such mysterious sightings lead to pilot confusion and potential safety consequences because of the distraction and extra chatter about them over the airwaves.\n\nThe core issue with pilots misidentifying satellites as UAPs stems from the fact that pilots cannot access real-time data about satellite movements, leaving them unprepared to recognize strange lights in the sky. These satellites may appear to move in unexpected ways, based on their orientation, and they may also appear and disappear, since their solar arrays reflect sunlight at different angles when deployed, relative to the pilot\u2019s position in flight.\n\nStarlink satellites orbit about 342 miles above Earth, according to Starlink\u2019s website, and that places them lower than most other satellites, making them visible to our eyes as spots of light, no magnification needed. More than 6,000 Starlink satellites are currently circling Earth, and the SpaceX-owned company aims to eventually have 42,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit, which means pilots will need to have surefire methods for identifying them.\n\n\n\nGetty Images The passage of Starlink satellites is seen in the sky over southern Poland on November 1, 2024.\n\nFour scientists want to fill the information gap in this type of situation to prevent unnecessary aviation risk. Led by mechanical engineer Douglas J. Buettner of the University of Utah, the team devised a method to simulate the exact locations of satellites, and they proposed plans that would provide pilots with the information they need to quickly identify satellites. Their paper describing this work was accepted at the 2024 International Academy of Astronautics Conference on Space Situational Awareness (ICSSA).\n\nTo shed some light on what the five pilots saw, the scientists conducted an \u201castrometric analysis\u201d of their reports, using two cell phone photos and a video the pilots had taken of \u201can unrecognized and possibly anomalous phenomenon,\u201d according to the paper. To corroborate the data, researchers looked up Starlink\u2019s records, noting that the visual line the satellites created in the sky\u2014called a \u201ctrain\u201d of satellites\u2014launched that same day. The team also used data from the flight, including photographs taken in the cockpit. Using these pieces of information and an orbital mechanics software tool, they were able to reconstruct the August 10 cockpit view. It showed Starlink satellites matching both the time and place of the sighting.\n\nTheir analysis used a technique called \u201cray-traced rendering\u201d of the view from the pilots\u2019 cockpit, which provided a more visual simulation of exactly where the pilots saw the satellites through their cockpit windows, according to the paper. The simulation experiments indicated that the satellites\u2019 solar arrays must have been deployed, likely making them glint brightly enough for the pilots in both aircraft to notice them. \u201cIn the implementation of our approach, we were able to closely match the apparent speed in degrees per second traveled by the object between the two photographs taken by one of the pilots,\u201d the scientists wrote.\n\nThe team hopes that their work demonstrates a plan that could plausibly \u201cwarn aviators and the public about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations,\u201d and therefore support aviation safety, they wrote. In the future, it\u2019s worth studying how the deployment of a satellite\u2014as well as its surface materials\u2014affects the way it reflects sunlight, the paper adds. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said on X that the satellite orientation could be adjusted to minimize solar reflection during astronomical experiments, though the team\u2019s paper does not specifically address this possibility.\n\nThe authors do suggest various procedures and technologies that aircraft could deploy to support accurate UAP identification. For example, pilots should be allowed to \u201croutinely provide photographic evidence from either an automated system when they are busy with safety critical aircraft operations, or using cell phones when they are not allowed,\u201d to greatly improve UAP analysis.\n\nSatellite operators should also provide information about satellite movements\u2014such as orientation, orbit location, and deployment timelines\u2014to support more accurate and detailed models, the scientists write. Finally, they suggest a way for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to reduce in-flight risks due to pilots trying to determine the source of a UAP. Air traffic controllers could have access to a satellite-modeling system that would enable them to anticipate satellite sightings and alert the pilots when necessary. \u201cWe envision this as a collaborative effort between the satellite\u2019s owners (in this case SpaceX/Starlink), the FAA, NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Space Force,\u201d the authors note.\n\nAs for people on the ground, anyone can find Starlink in the sky. Look up on a clear, dark night, and if you see a white light or \u201ctrain\u201d of lights moving across the sky, go to FindStarlink.com. You can search for your time and location and determine if what you see is indeed Starlink satellites."

            "article_content": "National Medal of Science\n\nPrinceton molecular biologist Bonnie Bassler has received the National Medal of Science, the nation\u2019s highest scientific honor. Two emeritus members of the Princeton faculty, Larry Martin Bartels and Ingrid Daubechies, and two undergraduate alumni, John Dabiri and Cynthia Dwork, were also among this year\u2019s 14 recipients of the White House honor, announced and awarded in a ceremony Jan. 3. The ceremony also honored nine individuals with National Medals of Technology and Innovation, the highest honor for technological achievement.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to those recipients of two of our nation\u2019s most prestigious honors, the National Medal of Science and National Medal of Technology and Innovation,\u201d said President Joseph Biden during the livestreamed ceremony. \u201cThis year\u2019s honorees represent a simple truth: As I\u2019ve always believed, America can be defined by a single word, \u2018possibilities.\u2019 That\u2019s who we are, a nation of possibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more delighted for Bonnie and the other medalists from the Princeton family,\u201d said Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber. \u201cBonnie\u2019s groundbreaking discoveries about bacterial messaging have revolutionized our concepts of what molecular communication can be and what a profound role it plays for all life-forms, from the simplest to the most complex.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cAll Princetonians, from our undergraduates through our senior faculty members, are encouraged to take intellectual risks, pursue radical new ideas, follow their curiosity \u2014 and as we see today, that can lead to astonishing accomplishments that fulfill our informal motto, Princeton \u2018in the nation\u2019s service and the service of humanity.\u2019\u201d The ceremony was held in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. Awards were presented by Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and assistant to the president for science and technology.\n\nBonnie L. Bassler\n\nBonnie Bassler and Arati Prabhakar\n\nBassler received the National Medal of Science \u201cfor paving the way to develop novel therapies to combat bacteria,\u201d according to the award citation read at the ceremony. \u201cSpending years in laboratories while sparking the imaginations of students, Bonnie Bassler established bacteria as social organisms with a widespread signaling system for communicating. Her revolutionary research opens a gateway to solving biological puzzles that can save lives.\u201d\n\nFrom her early work confirming how bacteria act in concert, to her growing understanding of the extraordinary webs of microbial messaging among the tiniest life-forms, Bassler has been a pioneer and global leader in the understanding of how bacteria communicate with each other.\n\n\u201cI am delighted and honored to receive the National Medal of Science. I am very proud of and grateful to my lab team,\u201d said Bassler, the Squibb Professor in Molecular Biology and the chair of the Department of Molecular Biology at Princeton University. \u201cThe festivities in D.C. were magical.\n\n\u201cMost moving and memorable to me were the speeches at the ceremony,\u201d Bassler said. \u201cThey were not about a scientist being the best in a field, or the first to make a revolutionary finding, but rather, about the importance of the recipients\u2019 research and mentorship of the next generations of scientists to democracy and to the vitality of and possibilities for the nation now and going forward.\n\n\u201cThat is not how I think of myself or my work on a day-to-day basis,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was both humbling and thrilling for my team\u2019s work to be considered in that realm.\u201d\n\nAmong her many honors, Bassler is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nShe is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and a recipient of Princeton University\u2019s President\u2019s Award for Distinguished Teaching, the Wolf Prize in Chemistry, the Canada Gairdner International Award, the Princess of Asturias Award from the Spanish Crown, the Gruber Prize, the Albany Prize, the L\u2019Or\u00e9al-UNESCO Women in Science Award, and a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant.\u201d\n\nBassler received her B.S. in biochemistry from the University of California-Davis and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLarry Martin Bartels\n\nLarry Martin Bartels and Arati Prabhakar\n\nBartels received the National Medal of Science \u201cfor thought leadership that promotes democracy around the world,\u201d according to his award citation. \u201cLarry Bartels\u2019 study of democratic institutions and analyses of partisanship and voting behavior, economic inequality, and political accountability offer astute insights that have shaped attitudes and call on all of us to protect our sacred democratic principles.\u201d\n\nBartels, Princeton\u2019s Donald E. Stokes Professor in Public and International Affairs, Emeritus, and an emeritus professor of politics, was on the Princeton faculty from 1991 to 2011. On Jan. 1, 2012, he transferred to emeritus status and joined the Department of Political Science at Vanderbilt University.\n\nBartels was the founding director of Princeton\u2019s Center for the Study of Democratic Politics at the School of Public and International Affairs. The center supports empirical research into democratic political processes and institutions.\n\nIt is very rare for a social scientist like Bartels to win the National Medal of Science, noted Christopher Achen, Princeton\u2019s Roger Williams Straus Professor of Social Sciences, Emeritus, and an emeritus professor of politics.\n\n\u201cLarry is widely regarded as the preeminent scholar of American representative democracy,\u201d said Achen, who co-authored \u201cDemocracy for Realists\u201d with Bartels in 2016. \u201cHe has an uncanny ability to use hard evidence to overturn cherished political pieties. A running theme in his work is that elites get their way far more than ordinary people do, even in democracies, but that neither liberals nor conservatives are typically right about how that happens or what to do about it. Thus, we have much hard thinking to do if we are to repair the many broken aspects of our contemporary politics.\u201d\n\nBartels received his B.A. from Yale University in 1978 and his doctorate from the University of California-Berkeley in 1983.\n\nIngrid Daubechies\n\nIngrid Daubechies and Arati Prabhakar\n\nDaubechies won the Medal of Science \u201cfor pioneering discoveries in the development of wavelets,\u201d according to her citation. \u201cA mathematician and physicist, Ingrid Daubechies has transformed the field of signal processing and the way society consumes, utilizes, and optimizes digital images and information, from art to smartphones and MRI machines. A trailblazer and a role model, she empowers women in math and science worldwide.\u201d\n\nDaubechies, Princeton\u2019s emeritus William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Mathematics and Applied and Computational Mathematics, was a member of Princeton\u2019s faculty from 1994 to 2011, during which time she became the first female full professor in the Department of Mathematics. She is now the James B. Duke Distinguished Professor Emerita of Mathematics at Duke University.\n\n\u201cThe astonishing range of Daubechies\u2019 work runs from repairing old master paintings to efficient transmission of signals through the internet,\u201d said Charles Fefferman, Princeton's Herbert E. Jones, Jr. \u201943 University Professor of Mathematics, who was at Princeton throughout Daubechies\u2019 17-year tenure and who chaired the math department from 1999-2002. \u201cMost famously, one of her discoveries transformed the wavelet transform from a curiosity to a basic tool of modern technology.\u201d\n\nAmong her many honors, Daubechies is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society of London, the American Mathematical Society, the Academia Europaea, and the National Academy of Engineering. She has also received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics, the L\u2019Or\u00e9al-UNESCO Award for Women in Science, the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics, the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award, and the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Electrical Engineering from the Franklin Institute.\n\nDaubechies received both her bachelor\u2019s and doctoral degrees in physics from Vrije Universiteit-Brussel, and she has six honorary doctorates.\n\nJohn O. Dabiri \u201901\n\nJohn Dabiri and Arati Prabhakar\n\nUndergraduate alumnus Dabiri received the Medal of Science \u201cfor outstanding achievements in aeronautical and biological engineering,\u201d according to his citation. \u201cInspired by the movements of fish and jellyfish, John Dabiri\u2019s work on biological fluid dynamics, turbulence and biological propulsion has advanced our clean energy future, leading to more efficient wind turbines and wind farms that make our world cleaner, safer, and more sustainable for future generations.\u201d\n\nDabiri, a B.S.E. graduate of the Class of 2001, is now the Centennial Chair Professor at Caltech. He is a MacArthur Fellow, a fellow of the American Physical Society and a fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering, as well as the recipient of the Alan T. Waterman Award from the National Science Foundation, the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program Award.\n\nAfter completing his summa cum laude degree from Princeton\u2019s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, he got an M.S. in aeronautics from Caltech in 2003 and a Ph.D. in bioengineering with a minor in aeronautics from Caltech in 2005. He was a professor of aeronautics and bioengineering at Caltech from 2005 to 2015, then spent four years teaching at Stanford before returning to Caltech.\n\nCynthia Dwork \u201979\n\nCynthia Dwork and Arati Prabhakar\n\nDwork received the Medal of Science \u201cfor visionary contributions to the field of computer science and secure public key cryptography,\u201d according to her citation. \u201cCynthia Dwork\u2019s innovative research, analysis and discoveries on differential privacy, fairness and algorithms, and statistical validity and adaptive data analysis help guide cutting-edge technologies across modern societies and play a critical role in advancing the global public good.\u201d\n\nDwork is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering, as well as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Her many awards include the G\u00f6del Prize, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Richard W. Hamming Medal, the ACM Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award, and multiple test-of-time awards.\n\nA B.S.E. graduate of the Class of 1979, Dwork is now the Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science, a Radcliffe Alumnae Professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, and affiliated faculty at Harvard Law School.\n\nWhile at Princeton, Dwork received the Charles Ira Young Award for Excellence in Independent Research. After completing her degree, she earned a Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1983."
