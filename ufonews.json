        "article_content": "Alien Corridors - The Falkirk Triangle - Tony McMahon - expert - from episode HANDOUT\n\nBonnybridge, a serene Scottish village, has catapulted to fame as one of the globe's leading UFO hotspots, boasting some 300 sightings each year\u2014notably outpacing well-known extraterrestrial haunts like Area 51 or Roswell. Nestled within what's been aptly named the Falkirk Triangle and often referred to as Scotland's own Roswell, this location is awash with eerie tales from alien abductions to bizarre spacecraft sightings, fuelling talk that it could be a portal to another dimension. UFO aficionados and even government entities have been drawn in by the growing conspiracy theories, with calls for action reaching the ears of four Prime Ministers. One particular chilling episode from 1992 saw buddies Garry Wood and Colin Wright alleging a harrowing captivity by aliens aboard a space vessel as they journeyed near Tarbrax in South Lanarkshire. Around 10pm, they witnessed an ominous \"black\" object suspended in the skies, uniquely unlit yet distinct with a round base and trio of segments measuring some 30ft across. \"I have been doing this job for 45 years. I honestly believe that somewhere in the skies of this planet we are dealing with non-human intelligence,\" claims Malcolm Robinson, a seasoned UFO investigator, who further contends that agencies such as NASA, the American government, and the Pentagon are all delving into these otherworldly encounters. These baffling events are given centre stage in a novel documentary series broadcast on Blaze, where specialists globally endeavour to fathom the extraordinary concentration of UFO activity within the so-called Falkirk Triangle, positioned over the Scottish cities of Falkirk, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, reports the Mirror. The friends reportedly blacked out for what they believe was 10-15 seconds, only to regain consciousness with their car facing the opposite direction and an hour of time inexplicably lost. The incident, which has since been dubbed the \"A70 incident\", is documented in a two-page report found within secret government \"X-files\" and was sent to the Ministry of Defence's UFO desk in 1996, four years after the encounter took place.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the MoD's UFO Unit was swamped with reports of mysterious sightings within the Falkirk Triangle\n\nThe report, titled \"Unexplained Aerial Sighting,\" is based on evidence provided by Mr Wood, who at the time was a 33-year-old ambulance technician from Edinburgh. Malcolm Robinson, a paranormal investigator, stated: \"Days after the incident, both men found scars on their bodies that weren't there before. Their wives refused to believe them, their colleagues at work refused to believe them.\" After researching paranormal experiences in the local library, they contacted Malcolm, who suggested they undergo hypnosis - the results were astonishing. Recalling the incident in 1996, Garry said: \"I saw three creatures coming towards my car. I felt intense pain, like an electric shock. Then I was in some room. I saw these things like wee men moving about, doing something to me. I could only see up. Then this 6ft creature approached.\" He described the creature as being \"white-grey in colour with a large head and dark eyes with a long, slender neck, very slim shoulders and waist. There were either ribs or folds of skin on its body. The arms were like ours, but there were four very long fingers.\" During the 1990s, the MoD's UFO Unit was swamped with reports of mysterious sightings within the Falkirk Triangle, sparking a public frenzy. Enormous meetings were convened as locals and UFO witnesses packed out venues, clamouring for explanations. Local councillor Billy Buchanan and Malcolm Robinson tirelessly campaigned for a parliamentary probe, knocking on Downing Street's door four times to present their case to John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and Rishi Sunak, all without success. \"We are demanding that the British government open up an inquiry into UFO sightings in Scotland,\" insists Malcolm.\n\nCrop circle's are believed to be imprints from aliens\n\n\"We are happy to turn over our files and photographs. But I doubt anything will happen, they are too stuck in their ways.\" \"They say that as these objects do not pose any threat to the security of the UK, the British Government will not open up any enquiries.\" In a chilling encounter from 1979, WWII veteran Bob Taylor, who participated in the liberation of Bergen Belsen, ventured into Dechmont Law woods in search of stray livestock. There, he stumbled upon a 'flying dome', a large sphere hovering just above the ground, dark and metallic with a sandpaper-like texture and equipped with small propellers. From this daunting object, smaller spheres dropped and rolled towards him, dragging him inexorably towards the enigmatic craft. Bob's last memory was of a peculiar burning smell and a swishing noise before everything turned pitch black. When he regained consciousness, he found himself unable to drive and decided to walk back to his home in Livingston. Upon reaching home, he broke down and told his wife about the attack he had suffered. Bob appeared dishevelled and beaten, with his trousers completely torn.\n\nTrending\n\nThe authorities who arrived at the scene noted indentations on the ground. The investigation concluded that Bob had been subjected to an unusually brutal attack, but it remained unclear by whom or what. The police eventually categorised it as an assault by an unidentified person or persons, putting the report on hold until more evidence could be gathered. Some experts speculated that Bob might have been struck by lightning or experienced a seizure. Throughout the investigations, Bob, described as an honest and reliable man of good character, stuck to his story until his death in 2007. Historian Tony McMahon, who has been researching the sightings, questions why witnesses would expose themselves to ridicule unless they genuinely believed they had encountered extraterrestrials. \"Those involved were seen as reputable figures, not as flakes,\" he says. \"These were completely normal people who had this absolutely bizarre experience.\" \"I think the fact that it has recurred in that area is fascinating.\" \"In the case of the Falkirk Triangle we are dealing with people who are seen as pillars of the community and what happened to them was quite traumatic.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nA small town with over 300 sightings and fearful locals\n\n\"You can't see an upside to making it up. I think these people genuinely believed that they saw what they reported.\" The mystifying Falkirk Triangle has been touted as one of Britain's UFO hotspots, with some claiming that the veil between worlds is especially thin there, offering a gateway to other dimensions. Others postulate the presence of an interstellar pathway threading through the area, positioning it as a prime cosmic rest stop. While archaeologist Natasha Billson views such claims with a healthy dose of skepticism, she can't help but note the correlation between UFO sightings and areas rich in archaeological heritage. \"When it comes to UFO sightings a lot of them are near to archaeological sites, such as Stonehenge,\" she observes. Moreover, Scotland hosts the most extensive network of stone circles across the British Isles. In contrast, Tony McMahon draws our attention to the triangle's proximity to two military air bases, less than 50 miles away, and its nearness to major airports like Glasgow and Edinburgh. He suggestively points out: \"There are two ways of looking at that. One is that what is happening on those military sites is misconstrued as UFO activity, everything from weather balloons to flares - even to cutting edge technology that the Government would rather you didn't know about. There is a perfectly good case to be made for that.\"\n\nNatasha Billson is sceptical\n\n\"Equally, there is an argument that if we are being watched by aliens, by extraterrestrials, there is every reason to suspect that they would take a particular interest in military installations.\" \"Some people say maybe they are taking an interest in military installations because they want to knock us out, invade, colonise us. But there is another argument put forward that they are taking an interest because they are protecting us from ourselves.\" \"There's even an argument that alien technology has been shared with us, but the aliens won't share any more, because we keep misusing it against each other. Somebody wrote that after Hiroshima and Nagasaki the aliens decided that was more than enough.\""

An eagle-eyed mariner was able to capture it on film - seemingly leaving the minds behind the new series at a loss.\n\nFootage filmed by an expedition commissioned by Netflix's Investigation Alien appears to show an unidentified flying aircraft descending into the English Channel\n\nThe brief clip appears to show an unidentified 'flying' object transforming into an unidentified 'submerged' object in real-time, experts said\n\n'[This was] with everybody sleeping, with the exception of our night watch guy,' underwater archaeologist Rory Kremer tells Knapp of the clip, which appears to an unidentified 'flying' object transforming into an unidentified 'submerged' object in real-time\n\n'Don't tell me it's going to go in the water,' Knapp says in response, as the orb descends.\n\n'I'll be damned,' he adds after it happens, showing real confusion.\n\nThe series' main investigator and narrator, Knapp proceeds to ask for Kremer's professional opinion.\n\nThe archaeologist with over 20 years of experience admits he is equally stumped, despite his crew being the ones to capture the clip,\n\n'So this is what it does when it thinks that nobody is watching?' Knapp asks before turning to Kremer. 'Have you ever seen anything like this?'\n\n'A willy peter flare is the only thing I know like that that will hang up in the air, but that's not a flare, because there's no smoke going off of it,' the archaeologist says, admitting he has no real answers - at least ones that involve human technology.\n\n'Look at that. It's under the water,' he goes on to exclaim, conceding to Knapp he does not know the craft's nature.\n\nUnderwater archaeologist Rory Kremer is seen speaking about the footage his crew caught off the Channel Islands with journalist and ufologist George Knapp, the series' main investigator\n\n'I don't got any answers - do you?' he asks - leaving Knapp to posit that it could be evidence of a subterranean base.\n\n'You think it's got a base down there?' Knapp asks his friend.\n\n'It could be. It could be.'\n\nThe two begin to speak about previous sightings in the region, which stretch back hundreds of years.\n\n'Archaeology is your thing,' Knapp asks Kremer at this point. 'What do you think?'\n\nKremer responds by pointing to the native tribes that once inhabited the region - and their tales of unknown objects flying.\n\n'All have oral histories of lights they cannot explain,' the expert said, telling Knapp how these sightings off the Channel Islands were 'usually attributed it to gods.'\n\n'It has gone on a long time,' he continued, before touting the clip's importance.\n\n'Archaeology is your thing,' Knapp asks Kremer at this point. 'What do you think?' Kremer responds by pointing to the native tribes that once inhabited the region - and their tales of unknown objects flying.\n\n'I think we really scratched the surface here. There could very well be something underwater.'\n\nKnapp, in a narration provided after the exchanged, agreed.\n\nPointing to previous reports of undersea anomalies seen skirting the skies as well, he accused the government of keeping similar evidence under wraps, despite them likely being extraterrestrial in natured.\n\n'I'm going to share this with some insiders I know [to] hopefully get more videos like this released to the public, to get to the bottom of what non human intelligence might be doing in our oceans,' Knapp said of the footage, which has yet to be released to the public.\n\n'This is not us. It's from somewhere else,' he maintained.\n\nThe video, meanwhile, does not show the unidentified craft exiting the water after seemingly lowering in.\n\nInvestigation Alien - a 'paranormal docuseries [where] renowned UFO reporter [Knapp] investigates new evidence, interviews an array of experts and meets with emerging witnesses who are finally willing to go on the record' - released Friday.\n\nIt's now streaming on Netflix."

        "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) agents can be a more effective tool compared to large language models (LLMs) or GenAI applications, opening up new possibilities to drive enterprise productivity and program delivery through business process automation, British professional services firm Deloitte said in a study.\n\nWith the aid of an AI agent, cases that were previously deemed too complex for GenAI can now be enabled at scale in a secure and effective manner, the study said.\n\nBy definition, the AI agent is an autonomous intelligent system that uses AI techniques to interact with its environment, collect data, and perform tasks without human intervention.\n\nExplaining the difference between Gen AI and AI agents, the study adds that typical LLM-powered chatbots usually have limited ability to understand multistep prompts.\n\n\"They (LLM or Gen AI) conform to the \"input-output\" paradigm of traditional applications and can get confused when presented with a request that must be deconstructed into multiple smaller tasks. They also struggle to reason over sequences, such as compositional tasks that require consideration of temporal and textual contexts. These limitations are even more pronounced when using small language models (SLMs), which, because they are trained on smaller volumes of data, typically sacrifice depth of knowledge and/or quality of outputs in favour of improved computational cost and speed,\" it said.\n\nThe study says that GenAI use cases have mostly been limited to standalone applications such as generating personalised ads based on a customer's search history and reviewing contracts, among others.\n\nOn the other hand, AI agents excel in addressing the limitations while also leveraging the capabilities of domain- and task-specific digital tools to complete more complicated tasks effectively. \"AI agents equipped with long-term memory can remember customer and constituent interactions--including emails, chat sessions and phone calls--across digital channels, continuously learning and adjusting personalised recommendations. This contrasts with typical LLMs and SLMs, which are often limited to session-specific information,\" the study adds.\n\nThe study further adds that while individual AI agents can offer valuable enhancements, businesses also need multiagent AI systems, given the limitations of single AI agents. However, the study notes that AI agents also introduce new risks that necessitate robust security and governance structures.\n\n\"A significant risk is potential bias in AI. algorithms and training data, which can lead to inequitable decisions. Additionally, AI agents can be vulnerable to data breaches and cyberattacks, compromising sensitive information and data integrity,\" it adds.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

In this co-op ghost-spotting game, your best defence is to hide in a cupboard, silently grateful you chose to wear your brown trousers. It offers a brilliantly British take on ghost-hunting, and, no matter how many times I\u2019ve been murdered by previously-unseen hands, I\u2019ve kept coming back for more.\n\nPhasmophobia\u2019s premise is that you, either solo or co-op, enter one of several haunted locations and identify a ghost. There\u2019s no busting to be done; instead, once you\u2019ve got enough data to say which type it is, your job is done. At least it is assuming you\u2019ve got a pulse.\n\nThat snag is that when the ghost thinks it has an advantage, typically because your sanity has seriously plunged, it\u2019ll initiate a hunt. Suddenly, the front door you\u2019ve been eying frantically slams shut, and you\u2019re forced to hide for the duration. And this is where the game becomes downright evil.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever played Alien Isolation, you\u2019ll know that shoving yourself into a locker is not a guarantee of safety. The alien can and will rip the door open. What Phasmophobia\u2019s ghosts sometimes do is open the door just a little, or maybe open one. Does that mean they know you\u2019re there? Not necessarily, but it was enough to scare the living daylights out of me.\n\nEven when you\u2019re not actively being pursued, the investigation elements of each hunt are still seriously fear-inducing. The game stops short of levitating you, but all those warning signs you get in found footage movies? They\u2019re in there. I thought I was safe in my truck, watching the feed on the camera I\u2019d placed on the kitchen counter. Then something suddenly flipped the camera over and I jumped out of my chair.\n\nThe other investigative instruments you wield can be a source of terror too. You can purchase additional devices, but one of the coolest items is a laser dot projector. With this, you can see some of the game\u2019s spectres. Except, every time I reach for it, I feel a tightness in my stomach. Each instrument brings you closer to your goal, discovering exactly what kind of haunting you\u2019re dealing with. But do I really want to know something\u2019s in the room with me?\n\nRelated: The best horror games on PS5\n\nWhether you\u2019re playing solo or multiplayer, chances are your ghost hunt isn\u2019t going to go the way you think it is. Maybe I\u2019ve not found the right team, or not got enough hunts under my belt. But for me, most multiplayer matches have ended in wonderful, instrument-dropping chaos.\n\nIt\u2019s still early days for my Phasmophobia journey. Maybe I\u2019ll become such a gifted ghost hunter that I\u2019ll ace every hunt. But given how many different ghosts there are, each with their own behaviour, I doubt it. And with the levels getting progressively bigger as you unlock them, there\u2019s even more distance between you and the front door.\n\nMore likely, a couple of months down the line, I\u2019ll still be quivering inside an airing cupboard, and loving every Ghostwatch-esque minute of it. And if you\u2019re prepared to forgo your proton packs and embrace Phasmophobia\u2019s gloomy British ghost-encounters, you\u2019ll have a hauntingly good time.\n\nPhasmophobia is available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5 and PC. We reviewed the PS5 version."

(Christopher Dolan / Staff Photographer) Show Caption 1 of 5 Expand\n\nCARBONDALE \u2014 \u201cPeace, love, aliens.\u201d\n\nDuane and Denise Lindenmuth bore the motto on their T-shirts Saturday, specially made for the Carbondalien Festival, marking the 50th anniversary of an infamous incident near Russell Park in Carbondale that many believe was a UFO crash landing on Nov. 9, 1974.\n\nThe legend began when three teenage boys alerted police after witnessing a \u201cred, whirring ball\u201d fall from the sky and into a mine pond. The incident drew police, military and the curious to the city and concluded with a dive team pulling a battery-powered mine lantern from the pond, according to newspaper reports from that time.\n\nThe Lindenmuths traveled about two hours from Ambler with other family members, to participate in the festival, which drew hundreds of people to Main Street. Most were decked out in fluorescent green, some with extra eyes or antennae sprouting from their heads.\n\nSome of those attending were simply out for an afternoon of fun with family, while others are true believers in UFOs and other supernatural phenomena.\n\nAdrian and Maria Johnson, of Kingston, were among the latter. Both are familiar with the history of UFO sightings, including the Roswell incident in 1947, which many believe was the crashing of a UFO near the town in New Mexico.\n\nAdrian Johnson pointed out President Harry Truman addressed the possibility of UFOs with reporters in the early 1950s.\n\n\u201cWe believe,\u201d said Maria Johnson.\n\nSasha Podunajec, of Waymart, attended the event with her mother Diane Gallagher, Moscow; and son Rowan, age 3.\n\nGallagher said the event was a great opportunity for Carbondale to celebrate its history and host a robust community event.\n\nCandace and Thomas Deblasio moved to the area recently and heard about the event at a senior presentation last week.\n\nThe two went \u201call out,\u201d with Thomas decked in a green inflatable costume and Candace in shimmering silver and slanted glasses.\n\n\u201cThese weren\u2019t our Halloween costumes; we bought them especially for today,\u201d Candace Deblasio said, laughing.\n\nChana Manarchuck was part of the committee that organized the event and said it exceeded expectations of planners.\n\n\u201cI think we should have it every year,\u201d she said. \u201cMy motto is \u2018bloom where you\u2019re planted.\u2019 \u201c\n\nTodd Pousley, of NeighborWorks, said the event provided the chance to chat with residents and visitors about their vision for Carbondale.\n\nIt was also an opportunity to encourage people to complete a survey aimed at documenting their suggestions for Carbondale for future projects.\n\nBradford May, part of the event committee, said the event exceeded expectations.\n\nOriginally, when the event was scheduled for Nov. 9, there was a question about whether cold weather might interfere with attendees\u2019 enjoyment of the day.\n\nBut moderate temperatures and clear skies were the perfect setting for vendors who offered everything from good food to home goods and information.\n\nThe day included an immersive \u201cThe Russell Park Experience,\u201d with transportation to the park, which was sold out early in the day, as well as a citywide scavenger hunt and special speakers.\n\nIt concluded with an after-party event at the ballroom of the Hotel Anthracite featuring \u201cParanormal State\u201d star Heather Taddy."

        "article_content": "Alien Corridors - The Falkirk Triangle - Tony McMahon - expert - from episode HANDOUT\n\nBonnybridge, a serene Scottish village, has catapulted to fame as one of the globe's leading UFO hotspots, boasting some 300 sightings each year\u2014notably outpacing well-known extraterrestrial haunts like Area 51 or Roswell. Nestled within what's been aptly named the Falkirk Triangle and often referred to as Scotland's own Roswell, this location is awash with eerie tales from alien abductions to bizarre spacecraft sightings, fuelling talk that it could be a portal to another dimension. UFO aficionados and even government entities have been drawn in by the growing conspiracy theories, with calls for action reaching the ears of four Prime Ministers. One particular chilling episode from 1992 saw buddies Garry Wood and Colin Wright alleging a harrowing captivity by aliens aboard a space vessel as they journeyed near Tarbrax in South Lanarkshire. Around 10pm, they witnessed an ominous \"black\" object suspended in the skies, uniquely unlit yet distinct with a round base and trio of segments measuring some 30ft across. \"I have been doing this job for 45 years. I honestly believe that somewhere in the skies of this planet we are dealing with non-human intelligence,\" claims Malcolm Robinson, a seasoned UFO investigator, who further contends that agencies such as NASA, the American government, and the Pentagon are all delving into these otherworldly encounters. These baffling events are given centre stage in a novel documentary series broadcast on Blaze, where specialists globally endeavour to fathom the extraordinary concentration of UFO activity within the so-called Falkirk Triangle, positioned over the Scottish cities of Falkirk, Glasgow, and Edinburgh, reports the Mirror. The friends reportedly blacked out for what they believe was 10-15 seconds, only to regain consciousness with their car facing the opposite direction and an hour of time inexplicably lost. The incident, which has since been dubbed the \"A70 incident\", is documented in a two-page report found within secret government \"X-files\" and was sent to the Ministry of Defence's UFO desk in 1996, four years after the encounter took place.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the MoD's UFO Unit was swamped with reports of mysterious sightings within the Falkirk Triangle\n\nThe report, titled \"Unexplained Aerial Sighting,\" is based on evidence provided by Mr Wood, who at the time was a 33-year-old ambulance technician from Edinburgh. Malcolm Robinson, a paranormal investigator, stated: \"Days after the incident, both men found scars on their bodies that weren't there before. Their wives refused to believe them, their colleagues at work refused to believe them.\" After researching paranormal experiences in the local library, they contacted Malcolm, who suggested they undergo hypnosis - the results were astonishing. Recalling the incident in 1996, Garry said: \"I saw three creatures coming towards my car. I felt intense pain, like an electric shock. Then I was in some room. I saw these things like wee men moving about, doing something to me. I could only see up. Then this 6ft creature approached.\" He described the creature as being \"white-grey in colour with a large head and dark eyes with a long, slender neck, very slim shoulders and waist. There were either ribs or folds of skin on its body. The arms were like ours, but there were four very long fingers.\" During the 1990s, the MoD's UFO Unit was swamped with reports of mysterious sightings within the Falkirk Triangle, sparking a public frenzy. Enormous meetings were convened as locals and UFO witnesses packed out venues, clamouring for explanations. Local councillor Billy Buchanan and Malcolm Robinson tirelessly campaigned for a parliamentary probe, knocking on Downing Street's door four times to present their case to John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and Rishi Sunak, all without success. \"We are demanding that the British government open up an inquiry into UFO sightings in Scotland,\" insists Malcolm.\n\nCrop circle's are believed to be imprints from aliens\n\n\"We are happy to turn over our files and photographs. But I doubt anything will happen, they are too stuck in their ways.\" \"They say that as these objects do not pose any threat to the security of the UK, the British Government will not open up any enquiries.\" In a chilling encounter from 1979, WWII veteran Bob Taylor, who participated in the liberation of Bergen Belsen, ventured into Dechmont Law woods in search of stray livestock. There, he stumbled upon a 'flying dome', a large sphere hovering just above the ground, dark and metallic with a sandpaper-like texture and equipped with small propellers. From this daunting object, smaller spheres dropped and rolled towards him, dragging him inexorably towards the enigmatic craft. Bob's last memory was of a peculiar burning smell and a swishing noise before everything turned pitch black. When he regained consciousness, he found himself unable to drive and decided to walk back to his home in Livingston. Upon reaching home, he broke down and told his wife about the attack he had suffered. Bob appeared dishevelled and beaten, with his trousers completely torn.\n\nTrending\n\nThe authorities who arrived at the scene noted indentations on the ground. The investigation concluded that Bob had been subjected to an unusually brutal attack, but it remained unclear by whom or what. The police eventually categorised it as an assault by an unidentified person or persons, putting the report on hold until more evidence could be gathered. Some experts speculated that Bob might have been struck by lightning or experienced a seizure. Throughout the investigations, Bob, described as an honest and reliable man of good character, stuck to his story until his death in 2007. Historian Tony McMahon, who has been researching the sightings, questions why witnesses would expose themselves to ridicule unless they genuinely believed they had encountered extraterrestrials. \"Those involved were seen as reputable figures, not as flakes,\" he says. \"These were completely normal people who had this absolutely bizarre experience.\" \"I think the fact that it has recurred in that area is fascinating.\" \"In the case of the Falkirk Triangle we are dealing with people who are seen as pillars of the community and what happened to them was quite traumatic.\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I think these people genuinely believed that they saw what they reported.\" The mystifying Falkirk Triangle has been touted as one of Britain's UFO hotspots, with some claiming that the veil between worlds is especially thin there, offering a gateway to other dimensions. Others postulate the presence of an interstellar pathway threading through the area, positioning it as a prime cosmic rest stop. While archaeologist Natasha Billson views such claims with a healthy dose of skepticism, she can't help but note the correlation between UFO sightings and areas rich in archaeological heritage. \"When it comes to UFO sightings a lot of them are near to archaeological sites, such as Stonehenge,\" she observes. Moreover, Scotland hosts the most extensive network of stone circles across the British Isles. In contrast, Tony McMahon draws our attention to the triangle's proximity to two military air bases, less than 50 miles away, and its nearness to major airports like Glasgow and Edinburgh. He suggestively points out: \"There are two ways of looking at that. One is that what is happening on those military sites is misconstrued as UFO activity, everything from weather balloons to flares - even to cutting edge technology that the Government would rather you didn't know about. There is a perfectly good case to be made for that.\"\n\nNatasha Billson is sceptical\n\n\"Equally, there is an argument that if we are being watched by aliens, by extraterrestrials, there is every reason to suspect that they would take a particular interest in military installations.\" \"Some people say maybe they are taking an interest in military installations because they want to knock us out, invade, colonise us. But there is another argument put forward that they are taking an interest because they are protecting us from ourselves.\" \"There's even an argument that alien technology has been shared with us, but the aliens won't share any more, because we keep misusing it against each other. Somebody wrote that after Hiroshima and Nagasaki the aliens decided that was more than enough.\""

        "article_content": "Edited from original article by World At Large, a news website of nature, politics, science, health, and travel.\n\nFor an entire generation of Americans who were glued to their TVs during the moon landing or watched The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson, Mutual of Omaha\u2019s Wild Kingdom provided the first glimpse of an Amazon rainforest or a Serengeti savannah, broadcast right into their living rooms via the first wildlife television show\u2014and now it\u2019s coming to the modern screen.\n\nPremiering in 1963 and running for 22-seasons while winning 41 major awards for episodes that were viewed countless millions of times, Mutual of Omaha\u2019s Wild Kingdom was the series that jumpstarted the wildlife programming we know today, like Animal Planet, Discovery Channel.\n\nReturning to its original home on NBC, Wild Kingdom has been reborn to entice a new generation to protect wildlife\u2014and it is co-hosted by one of the leading alums of the program.\n\nPeter Gros, who joined the original show as co-host in 1985 after Marlin Perkins\u2019 health declined, has brought on Dr. Rae Wynn-Grant, a predator ecologist and National Geographic Fellow for the new Saturday morning program\u2014which already won 4 Emmy nominations in its first season. It will also be streaming on YouTube, where fans can reminisce by watching highlights and full episodes from the 60s, 70s, and 80s.\n\nGros, whose son is an avid viewer of GNN told Andy Corbley, writing for World At Large, \u201cI think a lot of people were hungry to hear less doom and gloom stories about the future of our planet and its animals and the natural world. We\u2019re getting a lot of nice positive feedback.\u201d\n\nThe times they are a-changing\n\nThe world has changed since the days of Perkins and Jim Fowler\u2014and much of the change resulted in good news. For example, on two classic episodes, Gros highlighted the plight of the bald eagle and the alligator two of the first animals added to the US Endangered Species List. Today, the eagle is one of the most widespread and numerous raptors in America.\n\n\u201cBack in 1963, when Wild Kingdom first started doing the show with Marlon Perkins, their goal was to affect people\u2019s attitudes about the importance of conservation,\u201d Gros told WaL.\n\nToday, there is seemingly no end to the number of native wildlife species at serious risk, but the new iteration of the show is called Wild Kingdom\u2013Protecting the Wild, and aims to provide some optimism for today\u2019s youth.\n\n\u201cThe idea came up, \u2018let\u2019s tell the story of conservation successes\u2019. Let\u2019s create some hope, let\u2019s not have this next generation think that it\u2019s too late, because there are solutions to the problems that we have,\u201d said Gros.\n\n\u201cThe show we have been filming, is (about) how we do, indeed, have some problems with conservation, but here are some solutions\u201d. Watch an example, from their Season-1 clip about the adorable black-footed ferret\u2026\n\nGros received the offer to take over for an ailing Marlon Perkins, after making a career designing wildlife enclosures in America\u2019s zoos that were more natural. A childhood romping through a 3,600-acre forest his grandfather had reforested in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley had instilled in him a love of all wild things that eventually led him to a degree in animal husbandry with a focus on big cats.\n\nIn a career of more than 40 years in wildlife conservation, Gros has seen many successes. He recounts the story of the Channel Islands fox in one episode, and the recovery program that saved the species from extinction without ever having to move them from their native island. Their numbers were falling from multiple causes. A cattle ranch was destroying habitat, and golden eagles, which prey on terrestrial species, were drawn to the islands from the mainland due to the presence of invasive mammals.\n\n\u201cRather than collecting foxes and moving them off the island, and facing issues of disease since they were endemic only to the Channel Islands, the raising was done there on the island in large enclosures,\u201d he said. The foxes were an easy meal for the eagles, since they never had to worry about being preyed on before, but once the invasive species were cleared, the golden eagles departed.\n\nThe next generation\n\nIt isn\u2019t just animal protection that has changed over Peter\u2019s career, but the tech.\n\n\u201cYou could spend days near a water hole hoping animals would show up. You spent hours and hours hiding and waiting. And, to get those long sweeping shots, you had to use helicopters\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow what you see is a lot more natural animal behavior in the wild because we have very quiet drones. We don\u2019t have to get close at all, we have these incredible long lenses that shoot in digital and the photography is just incredible. You can set up motion and heat sensing cameras along trails and capture animals coming by. So the advantages to doing the new show is you see so much more natural behavior, and I have to admit, being involved in both eras, it\u2019s much easier on the body too by the way!\u201d\n\nJust as Mutual of Omaha\u2019s Wild Kingdom taught Americans about the challenges facing conservation, part of Protecting the Wild\u2019s mission is to inspire the next generation of conservationists with a science-based series\u2014and this summer, it captured a Saturday morning audience on NBC totaling over a million viewers per episode.\n\nMany of the episodes start by addressing the conservation status and threats of an animal featured that week, and then by the end of the show they\u2019ve creating hope through a narration about how this is problem is going to be solved.\n\nGros and his team decided there are so many good stories in North America to tell, they\u2019d start the first season with those\u2014such as the ocelot, a South American wildcat that occasionally strays into south Texas, and the North Atlantic right whale, one of the most endangered in the ocean with only 340 individuals left.\n\n\u201cTheir problem is entanglement with lobster pots\u2014literally millions of lines of ropes dangling from buoys in the water in areas where they would be traveling and feeding. Fortunately, again, reasons to hope: we worked with the Woods Hole Institute and their solution is rope-less lobster pots,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLike, so many of the projects we\u2019re filming, there are so many agencies, volunteers, and groups working together to make this happen.\u201d\n\nThe second season debuted on October 5th, and airs Saturday mornings during NBC\u2019s programming block, \u201cThe More You Know\u201d.\n\nHAIL THE COMEBACK By Sharing With Wildlife Loving Families on Social Media\u2026"

        "article_content": "KNOXVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 The opportunity was there for Mississippi State football.\n\nThe Bulldogs (2-8, 0-6 SEC) didn't play a clean first half, but only trailed by two possessions with Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava knocked out of the game at halftime with an injury. However, MSU didn't capitalize and lost 33-14 to the Vols (8-1, 5-1) on Saturday night at Neyland Stadium.\n\nHere are four overreactions to the loss.\n\nMississippi State slow starts fall on the coaching staff\n\nSaturday was another slow start for Mississippi State. The Bulldogs began with the ball first, like they have every single game this season, and quickly fell behind 7-0.\n\nThe MSU offense started with a three-and-out, a punt, an interception and another punt all in the first quarter. Tennessee scored a 36-yard touchdown on its first drive.\n\nThe Bulldogs have only scored twice on opening drives this season: A touchdown against Eastern Kentucky and a touchdown against Texas A&M. That\u2019s it.\n\nIt falls on the MSU coaching staff for not having the right scripted plays to begin games.\n\nMississippi State had its best rushing performance of the season\n\nThe upward trajectory of the Mississippi State rushing attack continued. Against this dominant Tennessee front, MSU had its most impressive rushing performance of the season.\n\nIt was again the running back combination of Davon Booth and Johnnie Daniels that both found success. They finished with a combined 188 rushing yards on 30 attempts. Seven of those carries went for at least 10 yards, including a 43-yard dash by Booth.\n\nThe offensive line deserves credit for consistently paving holes up the middle. Tennessee entered Saturday allowing just 89.8 rushing yards per game.\n\nMississippi State\u2019s defense is improving\n\nEven before Iamaleava's injury, the MSU defense was playing well, in relativity.\n\nSafety Hunter Washington forced and recovered a fumble in the first quarter on running back Dylan Sampson. MSU also made a goal-line stand on the ensuing drive.\n\nThe Tennessee offense didn't start running up the score until the second quarter. DeAgo Brumfield got burned for a touchdown on a 73-yard go route by Dont'e Thornton, then UT kicked two field goals in the final minute of the second quarter in part to MSU's poor clock management.\n\nRelativity is the key word. Of course, 33 points allowed isn't great, but it's at least two games in a row Mississippi State has been better since the Arkansas debacle.\n\nWASHINGTON UPDATE: Hunter Washington injury update: Mississippi State football SS exits game vs Tennessee\n\nThis was Michael Van Buren Jr.'s worst game\n\nThe numbers are accurate in displaying a poor performance from MSU quarterback Michael Van Buren Jr.\n\nVan Buren completed 10-of-26 passes for 92 yards and no touchdowns. He turned the ball over twice with an interception deep in MSU territory in the first quarter and lost a fumble in the second half.\n\nIt was the first time in Van Buren's six starts that he was held under 100 passing yards and didn't score.\n\nSam Sklar is the Mississippi State beat reporter for the Clarion Ledger.

        "article_content": "One of the most anticipated new smartphones has been announced: the OnePlus 13. This device will eventually replace the highly regarded OnePlus 12, one of the year\u2019s top phones. How do these two models compare? If you own a OnePlus 12, should you consider upgrading to the newer version? Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: specs\n\nOnePlus 13 OnePlus 12 Size 162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5 mm 164.3 x 75.8 x 9.2 mm (6.47 x 2.98 x 0.36 inches) Weight 210 grams 220 grams (7.76 ounces) Screen size and resolution 6.8-inch 1440p OLED with 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate 3168 x 1440 pixels at 510 pixels per inch 800 nits typical, 4,500 nits peak 6.82-inch LTPO AMOLED (Dynamic 1-120Hz) 3168 x 1440 resolution at 510 pixels per inch 600 nits typical, 4,500 nits peak Operating system Android with OxygenOS Android with OxygenOS Storage 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB 256GB, 512GB Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 RAM 12GB, 16GB, or 24GB 12GB or 16GB Cameras 50-megapixel main 50MP ultrawide 50MP 2X zoom Front: 32MP Rear: 50MP primary, 48MP ultrawide, and 64MP periscope telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom Front: 32MP Water resistance IP69 IP65 Battery 6,000mAh Fast charging 100W (TBA in the U.S.) Fast wireless charging (50W) Reverse wireless charging (10W) 5,400mAh Fast charging 100W (80W in the U.S.) Fast wireless charging (50W) Reverse wireless charging (10W) Colors White Dawn, Blue Moments, Obsidian Black Flowy Emerald, Silky Black Price TBA worldwide From $800 Review To be released OnePlus 12\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: design and display\n\nOnePlus is recognized for its innovative phone designs, evident in the OnePlus 13. While the new phone maintains the distinctive OnePlus identity, it introduces several noteworthy differences compared to the previous model. One significant change is the phone\u2019s flat sides, reminiscent of the Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy phones, and Google Pixel. This design contrasts with the OnePlus 12, which features curved sides, potentially offering improved grip. Additionally, the OnePlus 13 boasts a slightly slimmer and lighter body, and its IP69 rating indicates enhanced resistance to water and dust.\n\nThe differences in display between the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 12 are subtle but noteworthy. Both phones feature a 6.8-inch AMOLED display with a sharp 1440p resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, delivering vibrant colors and deep blacks.\n\nOne key improvement in the OnePlus 13 is its typical brightness, which reaches 800 nits, compared to 600 nits on the OnePlus 12. Additionally, the OnePlus 13 utilizes the newer BOE X2 OLED panel technology, promising enhanced visual quality. However, both models maintain the same peak brightness of 4,500 nits.\n\nRegarding protection, the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 12 are equipped with Gorilla Glass Victus 2. The OnePlus 13 also features an additional \u201ccrystal shield super-ceramic glass layer.\u201d\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: performance\n\nIt will be a while before we can try the OnePlus 13, but the specifications indicate that it will offer a significant performance boost over its predecessor.\n\nThe OnePlus 13 features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the OnePlus 12. This updated chipset has an Adreno GPU, which promises smoother gaming and faster graphics.\n\nEarly benchmarks from AnTuTu show that the OnePlus 13 delivers 58% better overall performance, while GeekBench 6 indicates a 36% improvement in single-core performance. This improvement should result in noticeable enhancements for everyday tasks and general usage.\n\nThe question remains: how much better performance can we expect on the new phone? The OnePlus 12 already demonstrated impressive capabilities during daily tasks such as checking email, browsing social media, and watching videos. With its dual cryo-velocity cooling system, it also excelled in handling graphically intensive gaming sessions without any issues. We can likely anticipate similar performance from the OnePlus 13, with even greater enhancements expected for the models equipped with 24GB of RAM.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: battery and charging\n\nAnother noticeable change made on the OnePlus 13 is its larger battery. Where the OnePlus 12 includes a 5,400mAh battery, the one on the OnePlus 13 is 6,000mAh. The larger battery capacity is thanks to silicon-carbon battery technology that allows for more energy storage in a smaller space. This should mean longer battery life, although that depends on what you\u2019re doing.\n\nDepending on your display settings and usage, the OnePlus 12 can probably last up to two full days on a single charge. When more intensive tasks are added to the mix, that drops to around a day of use between charges.\n\nThe OnePlus 13\u2019s larger battery capacity should allow it to outperform its successor, offering improved performance in demanding tasks, potentially better longevity since the battery will undergo fewer charging cycles, and more. Again, it\u2019s a little bit too early to determine just how much the improvements will be.\n\nOne area where you won\u2019t see a difference between the two phones is when it comes to actual charging. OnePlus did not enhance the charging speeds for wired or wireless charging. Like its predecessor, the OnePlus 13 supports 100W fast charging, 50W wireless charging, and reverse charging up to 10W. The OnePlus 12 was restricted to 80W charging speeds in the U.S. though, and it remains to be seen whether the OnePlus 13 echoes this limitation.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: cameras\n\nHistorically, the camera systems on OnePlus phones have been sound but often ranked below those of industry leaders like Samsung and Google. This trend began to shift in recent years, particularly following the company\u2019s strategic partnership with Hasselblad, which kicked off with the OnePlus 9 series. This collaboration aimed to elevate OnePlus\u2019 photographic capabilities by leveraging Hasselblad\u2019s expertise in color science and imaging technology. As a result, each subsequent release has demonstrated consistent improvements in camera performance and overall imaging quality.\n\nThe OnePlus 13 features an impressive triple-camera setup, each boasting a high-resolution 50-megapixel sensor. At its core is a state-of-the-art 50MP primary sensor from Sony, known for its exceptional light-gathering abilities and sharp image reproduction. Complementing this is a 50MP ultrawide sensor, which offers a remarkable 120-degree field of view, allowing users to capture expansive landscapes and group photos without compromising on detail. Finally, the setup includes a 50MP telephoto lens that provides 3x optical zoom, enabling users to get closer to their subjects without losing image fidelity.\n\nThese enhancements not only contribute to a broader field of view but are also geared toward improving image quality in various lighting conditions, especially low-light scenarios, thanks to advanced sensor technologies and algorithms that enhance dynamic range and reduce noise.\n\nActual testing will be crucial in determining just how much better the camera experience is on the OnePlus 13 compared to its predecessor, which already had an impressive camera setup.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: software and updates\n\nThe OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 12 both operate on OxygenOS, OnePlus\u2019 custom Android interface. However, their software and update policies differ significantly.\n\nThe OnePlus 13 comes with OxygenOS 15, based on Android 15, meaning you will have access to the latest Android features and security updates right from the start. In contrast, the OnePlus 12 requires an upgrade to obtain the same features.\n\nA major distinction lies in software support. OnePlus guarantees four major Android updates and five years of security updates for the OnePlus 13. In comparison, the OnePlus 12 is supported with three major Android updates and four years of security updates.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: price and availability\n\nThe OnePlus 13 will launch first in China, with a worldwide release likely to begin at the beginning of the year. The phone is expected to start at $799 in the U.S., which is similar to the OnePlus 12\u2019s launch price. However, this hasn\u2019t been confirmed. The phone comes in White-Dawn, Blue Moments, and Obsidian Black.\n\nThis year\u2019s phone has 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage and 12GB, 16GB, or 24GB of RAM, respectively. The OnePlus 12 has 256GB or 512GB of storage and 12GB or 16GB of RAM. It is available in Silky Black and the now iconic Flowy Emerald.\n\nOnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 12: Is it worth the upgrade?\n\nThe OnePlus 12 is an outstanding smartphone that current owners can enjoy for many years due to its powerful performance and robust features. With its sleek design, high-resolution display, and impressive camera capabilities, the OnePlus 12 meets the needs of a wide range of users, from casual consumers to tech enthusiasts.\n\nWhether to upgrade to the OnePlus 13 depends largely on your preferences and priorities. If you value having the latest chipset \u2014 such as a more advanced Snapdragon processor \u2014 along with ever-improving battery life and cutting-edge camera systems, then the OnePlus 13 is a compelling upgrade. The new model promises enhancements in processing power and efficiency and offers features like upgraded night mode photography and advanced computational photography, which could significantly enhance your photography experience. Additionally, it features a fresh design that brings a modern aesthetic to the table.\n\nHowever, if you typically do not upgrade your phone yearly, waiting this time might be perfectly reasonable. While you may not have the best-performing OnePlus available on the market, and the camera system will not be as advanced as the new model, the differences between the OnePlus 12 and 13 are mostly incremental. The OnePlus 12 still excels in everyday tasks, gaming, and multitasking, and its functionality remains top-notch. Therefore, while the upgrades are excellent and can enhance user experience, they are optional for everyone. If your OnePlus 12 meets your needs and performs well, holding off on an upgrade might be your best option."
