When you\u2019re down there laying a bead or striking an arc \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just something special,\" said Mourich.\n\nOne of 1,200 other Career Center students, he said he aspires to be a pipeline welder when he completes his high school education.\n\n\u201cSometimes, I think about counting, \u2018cause sometimes I tend to speed up. So, sometimes I have to slow myself down. I mean, there\u2019s a range of things. Sometimes I\u2019ll sing myself a little song,\" said Mourich, while explaining the welding process.\n\nRob Paul, a Career Center social studies teacher and advisor for the student advisory board said he believes the welding students \"blew (the float) out of the ballpark.\""

But, one AI camera by a Hong Kong startup is a wholesome and inclusive take on the technology. Seekr is a wearable camera that uses AI to describe the surroundings to the visually impaired.\n\nDesigned by Vidi Labs, Seekr was recently honored as a CES Innovation Awards nominee for 2025. The wearable camera clips to clothing and then, using AI, it voices what it sees in the surroundings to the wearer\u2019s Bluetooth earpiece. A button on the camera allows the wearer to ask for a description with a quick press, or change modes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a video demonstration, Vidi Labs shared how the device voices descriptions such as \u201ctwo people sitting on a bench.\u201d The camera\u2019s depth perception also means that the Seekr can voice descriptions like \u201cstairs in one meter.\u201d The device is also capable of reading text on signs.\n\nAccording to New Atlas, the idea came during Covid lockdowns when social distancing meant that the visually impaired couldn\u2019t rely on a friend to help describe the world around them. Vidi Labs, which was founded in 2021, describes itself as an accessibility technology company.\n\nVidi Labs isn\u2019t the only company to recognize the impact that AI\u2019s ability to describe images could have on people with limited vision. For example, Envision started as a smartphone app that could describe surroundings and later expanded to Google Glass.\n\nOther apps have existed well before the age of AI. Be My Eyes, a mobile app that launched in 2015, originally used volunteers and video calls, later adding AI-assisted options in addition to the volunteer-based service.\n\nWhile Seekr hasn\u2019t yet launched, the company\u2019s website has a waiting list to alert those interested in the device when the camera becomes available."

Visit the OpenAI API platform and create an account to get your API key. This key is essential to authenticate you when making requests to OpenAI's servers.\n\n2. Read API Documentation: Before API integration, please take some time to read the complete official Open API documentation. It contains complete information about all the endpoints in the API parameters, request formats, and response formats.\n\n3. Install Needed Libraries: You have made up your mind, so you are going to work with the program and install the libraries necessary for running the API within your development environment. For instance, if you are using the Python programming language, that simply means that you will need an open-source Python library for interfacing with the API.\n\n4. Secure Your App with API Key: Once you have the API key, configure your application to securely store and consume it. Do not expose an API key in your source code; doing so would be a security breach. Many developers store their API keys in an environment variable."

            "article_content": "Stanley Milford, Jr. has stories that most people wouldn\u2019t dare to believe.\n\nA seasoned Navajo Ranger, he spent 23 years exploring the depths of the paranormal on the Navajo Nation. From hauntings and Bigfoot sightings to UFOs and the mysterious appearances of coins falling out of thin air \u2014 all of it happened on his watch, and all of it left a mark.\n\nMilford, of Navajo and Cherokee descent, is a Fort Lewis College graduate who recently published his memoir.\n\nThe Paranormal Ranger is an account of Milford\u2019s time as a Navajo Ranger, during which he investigated supernatural occurrences around the reservation. The author juxtaposes his personal accounts with Navajo creation stories.\n\nThe book is a personal account of Milford\u2019s 23 years as a Navajo Ranger. The Rangers are part of the Navajo Nation\u2019s Division of Natural Resources, and they're tasked with protecting the lands and natural sites on the reservation.\n\n\u201cWe were assigned to investigate cases that were out of the ordinary,\u201d said Milford, \u201cinvolving what is commonly referred to as paranormal or supernatural haunting cases, Bigfoot cases, UFOs, extraterrestrial witchcraft, and Skinwalker-related cases.\u201d\n\nStanley Milford, Jr.'s book, The Paranormal Ranger, shares his experiences working with supernatural cases as a Navajo Ranger.\n\nSkinwalkers are evil spirits that can take animal form and often move on all fours. They\u2019re rarely discussed with outsiders unfamiliar with Navajo culture and beliefs. In The Paranormal Ranger, Milford shares some of these guarded stories, hoping to shed light on Navajo traditions and supernatural experiences.\n\nHe details an investigation he was a part of in Window Rock, Arizona.\n\n\u201cIn two days, there were 66 U.S. coins that would apport or just appear out of thin air and fall on the floor, or they would come flying across the room,\u201d said Milford. \u201cSometimes, they would hit us investigators. Out of all of those 66 coins, they all landed heads up.\n\nI witnessed with my own eyes at least 10 of these coins falling out of thin air, out of nothingness. That, for me, was a life-changing experience. It made me realize that the coins had to be coming from somewhere, some other space.\n\nFrom that time, this phenomenon followed me. I began having the coins appear in my home that would fall on the floor or fly across the room,\u201d said Milford.\n\nMilford juxtaposes his personal accounts of paranormal activities with Navajo creation stories in the book. These are the origin stories of the world and the Din\u00e9 people. He says he drew parallels between the Navajo emergence stories and what he experienced with these paranormal cases.\n\n\u201cThere's a different world that the Navajo people came [from]. They came into the physical world from four worlds or five lower worlds. When you look at the descriptions of the beings described in those tales, [they] fit with what I saw with the descriptions of the Bigfoot and extraterrestrial or alien beings,\u201d said Milford.\n\nMilford noted that he worked alongside 40 to 50 rangers as a Navajo Ranger. Today, there are less than ten.\n\nCopyright 2024 Four Corners Public Radio"

            "article_content": "The 1979 classic 'Naa Ninna Bidalare', a chilling horror film starring Anant Nag and Lakshmi, left a lasting impression on the audiences and remains as the gold standard of horror filmmaking in Kannada cinema. After 45 years since the original film was released, the question looms large: can this new iteration of 'Naa Ninna Bidalare' still send shivers down the spine like the original did?\n\nThe film opens with a group of ghost hunters using advanced technology to track down supernatural forces. They arrive at a house, expecting to uncover evidence of paranormal activity, but instead find themselves ensnared by the very spirit they were hunting. The once confident investigators become victims of the unseen force; their technological tools are no match for the vengeful spirit haunting the house.\n\nFast forward to Mysore, where Rishi (Panchi S), a wedding event organiser, encounters Charvi (Ambali Bhaarati) by chance on the riverbank of Madikeri. She is found unconscious, her clothes stained with blood. As Rishi learns more about Charvi, he discovers she has no memory of the events that led her there. With gaps in her memory and a growing sense of unease surrounding her, Rishi takes it upon himself to uncover her past. He suggests involving the police, but the deeper they dig, the more mysterious her history becomes.\n\nRishi brings Charvi to stay with him, and she ends up living with him for over a year. But things take a darker turn when a missing person complaint is filed in the nearby village of Kathle Kadu. As Rishi, Charvi, and two of his friends investigate further, they uncover a disturbing truth: the locals in her village don\u2019t recognise her, and even stranger, some people claim she\u2019s someone else entirely. Tension and unease deepen as Charvi becomes more elusive with each passing day."

Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nThe source of energy is a binary star system\n\nAstronomers discover record burst of energy coming from deep space\n\nBy Akash Pandey 07:14 pm Nov 30, 202407:14 pm\n\nWhat's the story A team of astronomers from the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) has detected a record-breaking energy burst from deep space. The source of this intense energy pulse, dubbed GLEAM-X J0704-37, is a binary system consisting of a small red dwarf star and a white dwarf, the remnant of a dead star. They made the discovery using archival low-frequency data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).\n\nUnique phenomenon\n\nGLEAM-X J0704-37: A unique long-period radio transient\n\nThe energy pulse, GLEAM-X J0704-37, is a one-of-a-kind long-period radio transient that erupts every three hours and lasts for 30-60 seconds. This makes it the longest-lasting case of such a phenomenon ever recorded. Since their first detection in 2006, these transients have baffled astronomers with their ability to generate radio waves. The latest discovery could shed light on the source of these energy bursts.\n\nResearch hurdles\n\nChallenges in studying long-period radio transients\n\nThe study of long-period radio transients has been difficult because they are located in densely populated regions of the Milky Way. This makes it hard to figure out what is producing these bursts of radio waves. Natasha Hurley-Walker, a member of the discovery team and researcher at Curtin University, said an optical image is required to understand these transients but there are often too many stars blocking the view.\n\nStar system\n\nGLEAM-X J0704-37's origin traced to specific star system\n\nThe discovery of GLEAM-X J0704-37 was a stroke of luck since it came from a less crowded region of the Milky Way, around 5,000 light-years away. \"Our new discovery lies far off the galactic plane, so there are only a handful of stars nearby, and we're now certain one-star system, in particular, is generating the radio waves,\" Hurley-Walker said. The team traced the origin of this peculiar long-period radio transient to one particular star system using South Africa's MeerKAT telescope.\n\nBinary system\n\nBinary system of red and white dwarf powers radio emission\n\nThe researchers found one of the stars in the GLEAM-X J0704-37 emitting system to be a low-mass red dwarf star or M-dwarf. However, an M-dwarf alone couldn't generate the observed energy levels. Additional analysis indicated that this red dwarf is part of a binary system with another object, possibly a white dwarf. \"Together, they power radio emission,\" Hurley-Walker said, explaining the source of these powerful energy bursts.\n\nTheory\n\nMagnetic fields and energy blasts: A new theory\n\nThe research team suggested that strong magnetic fields in this binary system could be causing the periodic energy blasts. These are similar to those seen from rapidly spinning neutron stars or pulsars. The unique location of the GLEAM-X J0704-37 emitting system helped researchers rule out a highly magnetic neutron star, or magnetar, as its source. The team is now working on confirming this binary system's nature and explaining how it launched GLEAM-X J0704-37."

            "article_content": "Footprints dating back 1.5 million years made by two different species of human ancestors have been found at the same spot\u2014a fossil first\u2014and the individuals likely passed within an hour from each other.\n\nMore than a million years ago, on a hot savannah teeming with wildlife near the shore of what would someday become Lake Turkana in Kenya, two completely different species of hominins may have passed each other as they scavenged for food.\n\nScientists know this because they have examined 1.5-million-year-old fossils unearthed here and have concluded they represent the first example of two sets of hominin footprints made about the same time on an ancient lake shore.\n\nThe discovery will provide more insight into human evolution and how species cooperated and competed with one another, said scientists who explained that \u201chominin\u201d is a newer term that describes a subdivision of the larger category known as hominids. Hominins includes all organisms, extinct and alive, considered to be within the human lineage that emerged after the split from the ancestors of the great apes, believed to have occurred about 6 million to 7 million years ago.\n\nThe study, published Thursday in the journal Science, offers hard proof that different hominin species lived contemporaneously in time and space, overlapping as they evaded predators and weathered the challenges of safely securing food in the ancient African landscape. Making the footprints were the two most common human species of the Pleistocene Epoch\u2014Homo erectus and Paranthropus boisei, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cTheir presence on the same surface, made closely together in time, places the two species at the lake margin, using the same habitat,\u201d said Rutgers University Professor Craig Feibel, an author of the study.\n\nFeibel, who has conducted research since 1981 in that area of northern Kenya, a rich fossil site, applied his expertise in stratigraphy and dating to demonstrate the geological antiquity of the fossils at 1.5 million years ago. He also interpreted the depositional setting of the footprint surface, narrowing down the passage of the track makers to a few hours, and showing they were formed at the very spot of soft sediments where they were found.\n\nIf the hominins didn\u2019t cross paths, they traversed the shore within hours of each other, Feibel said.\n\n\u201cFossil footprints are exciting because they provide vivid snapshots that bring our fossil relatives to life,\u201d said Kevin Hatala, the study\u2019s first author, and an associate professor of biology at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nAMAZING: Fossil of Neanderthal Child with Down\u2019s Syndrome Hints at Early Humans\u2019 Compassion\n\nProf. Hatala has been investigating hominin footprints since 2012, and says they reveal how living individuals, millions of years ago, were moving around their environments and potentially interacting with each other, or even with other animals.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that we can\u2019t really get from bones or stone tools.\u201d\n\nWhile skeletal fossils have long provided the primary evidence for studying human evolution, new data from fossil footprints are revealing fascinating details about the evolution of human anatomy and locomotion, and giving further clues about ancient human behaviors and environments.\n\nAn expert in foot anatomy, Hatala found the prints reflected different patterns of anatomy and locomotion. He and several co-authors distinguished one set of footprints from another using new methods they recently developed to enable them to conduct a 3D analysis.\n\n\u201cIn biological anthropology, we\u2019re always interested in finding new ways to extract behavior from the fossil record, and this is a great example,\u201d said Rebecca Ferrell, a program director at the National Science Foundation who helped fund this portion of the research. \u201cThe team used cutting-edge 3D imaging technologies to create an entirely new way to look at footprints, which helps us understand human evolution and the roles of cooperation and competition in shaping our evolutionary journey.\u201d\n\nCHECK OUT: Prehistoric \u2018Axe Factory\u2019 Found in Britain Triggers Search for More Artifacts\n\nMs. Feibel described the discovery as \u201ca bit of serendipity\u201d for researchers in 2021 organized by Louise Leakey, a third-generation paleontologist.\n\nFeibel noted it had long been hypothesized that these two human species coexisted. According to fossil records, Homo erectus, a direct ancestor of humans, persisted for 1 million years more. Paranthropus boisei, however, went extinct within the next few hundred thousand years (but scientists don\u2019t know why).\n\nBoth species possessed upright postures, bipedalism, and were highly agile. Little is yet known about how these coexisting species interacted, both culturally and reproductively.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Humble Stick Reveals Wealth of Information About Extinct Heidelberg Hominids as Hunters and Craftsmen\n\nThe footprints are significant, Feibel said, because they fall into the category of \u201ctrace fossils\u201d, which cannot be moved\u2014not part of an organism, but offering important evidence of behavior.\n\n\u201cThis proves beyond any question that not only one, but two different hominins were walking on the same surface, literally within hours of each other,\u201d Feibel said. \u201cThe idea that they lived contemporaneously may not be a surprise. But this is the first time demonstrating it. I think that\u2019s really huge.\u201d\n\nSHARE THE AMAZING SCIENCE With Paleo-Lovers on Social Media\u2026"

            "article_content": "Discover the best crypto coins to buy in 2024: Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, Pepe Coin, and BlockDAG. Explore their innovative ecosystems and the ROI potential.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts are always looking for assets with solid potential, and 2024 is ending as arguably one of the biggest years for the crypto market. With various crypto networks showing unique architecture and growth potential, it\u2019s a great time to explore the best crypto coins to buy in 2024.\n\nWhat matters the most for crypto freaks is the long-term growth potential and the maximum returns the crypto projects offer. Among the various options, Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe Coin (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and BlockDAG (BDAG) are showing great potential, with analysts naming them the among the best crypto coins to buy in 2024.\n\nLet\u2019s look at these standout coins to see what makes them the best crypto coins to buy in 2024.\n\n1. BlockDAG Sets New Benchmarks with $152M Presale\n\nThe BlockDAG (BDAG) presale has charted an impressive growth trajectory, with the coin value surging from an initial price of $0.001 in Batch 1 to $0.0234 in Batch 2026 \u2014 showing a 2240% increase. This upward movement marks BlockDAG\u2019s strength and appeal in the crypto market.\n\nThe presale has raised $152 million from selling over 16.6 billion coins \u2014 a clear indicator of the massive interest among crypto enthusiasts. Such milestones highlight the network\u2019s momentum, which has led analysts to predict 30,000x ROI, making BlockDAG top the list of best crypto coins to buy in 2024.\n\nAt the core of this success lies BlockDAG\u2019s commendable architecture, which addresses the blockchain trilemma of security, scalability, and decentralization. Unlike traditional blockchain systems that struggle to balance these aspects, BlockDAG seamlessly integrates Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) features with blockchain security protocols. This hybrid model ensures high scalability and rapid transaction speeds without compromising on security.\n\nBlockDAG\u2019s ecosystem is equally transformative. Its low-code/no-code platform empowers users to create meme coins and NFTs effortlessly, challenging Solana\u2019s dominance in meme coin development. With pre-built templates and streamlined deployment tools, BlockDAG could soon become the preferred hub for memecoin development.\n\n2. Shiba Inu\u2019s Recent 40% Surge Leads to Bullish Momentum\n\nShiba Inu has experienced a 40% monthly increase, trading around $0.0000254. This surge is attributed to a 5,000% spike in its burn rate, eliminating nearly 60 million tokens in 24 hours, thereby reducing supply and potentially increasing value. Additionally, SHIB\u2019s exchange-held supply has reached a three-year low, indicating a shift towards self-custody and decreased immediate selling pressure.\n\nThe Shibarium layer-2 scaling solution has also achieved significant milestones, processing over 500 million transactions and surpassing 8 million total blocks, enhancing the ecosystem\u2019s scalability and efficiency. Analysts predict a potential 50% rally if SHIB surpasses $0.00002800, with some forecasting a surge up to $0.00022.\n\n3. PEPE Coin Rebounds After 27% Decline From Peak\n\nPepe Coin has declined over 27% from its annual peak, currently trading at $0.0000187 with a market cap exceeding $7.8 billion. Recent data indicates a 1.46% reduction in PEPE holdings on exchanges, now at 239.84 trillion tokens, suggesting increased long-term holding by investors.\n\nThis trend could decrease selling pressure, potentially driving prices higher. Additionally, significant whale activity has been observed, with a notable transaction involving the purchase of 1.01 trillion PEPE tokens worth approximately $19 million. Such large-scale acquisitions reflect growing confidence among substantial investors, which may further strengthen PEPE\u2019s price.\n\n4. Dogecoin Tests Key Resistance with $20 Potential\n\nDogecoin has achieved a year-to-date gain exceeding 400%, currently trading at $0.404, which is 45% below its 2021 all-time high of $0.7316. Crypto analysts note that DOGE is testing a critical resistance level at $0.40; a sustained break above this could propel the price to $0.43, while failure may lead to a decline to $0.36 or $0.34.\n\nPositive developments, such as the U.S. government\u2019s establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the launch of Valour\u2019s Dogecoin exchange-traded product in Sweden, have strengthened investor confidence. Predictions show a potential long-term surge to $20, citing DOGE\u2019s consistent wave patterns.\n\nThe Ultimate Best Crypto of 2024: Which One Wins the Title?\n\nThe market identifies BlockDAG as the best crypto coin to buy in 2024 for its solid growth potential that crypto enthusiasts eagerly seek. Its presale success, raising $152 million, and the 2240% surge from its initial batch price highlight its appeal in the competitive market.\n\nWith an innovative hybrid architecture seamlessly integrating scalability, security, and decentralization, BlockDAG is emerging as the ultimate hub for meme coin and NFT development, challenging established networks in the crypto space.\n\nThe broader cryptocurrency market mirrors this enthusiasm, with Shiba Inu\u2019s 40% monthly rise, Pepe Coin\u2019s increasing investor confidence, and Dogecoin\u2019s steady resistance levels showcasing promising trends. Yet, BlockDAG\u2019s unparalleled growth trajectory places it ahead of the pack.\n\nThe subject matter and the content of this article are solely the views of the author.

That transition became official back in June, when VW announced a joint venture with Rivian.\n\nMeanwhile, the automaker also announced last summer it would delay the launch of a new flagship electric vehicle (EV), called Trinity, initially planned for 2026. German press reports at the time suggested the delay was to make room for none-other than the next-gen electric Golf.\n\nAnd now that VW\u2019s venture with Rivian has officially kicked off earlier this month, all the pieces are coming together.\n\n\u201cWe decided on how to do the software-defined vehicle,\u201d VW CEO Thomas Schafer said during a media roundtable. \u201cIt will happen with, the joint venture, where we put the new electric-electronics architecture together. But we have also decided that we want to start this journey with a more iconic product. So we\u2019ll start with the Golf.\u201d\n\nThe next-gen electric Golf is now expected for 2029, followed by Trinity in the following years.\n\nThe Volkswagen-Rivian venture first plans to use Rivian\u2019s electrical architecture and software technology stack to enable the launch of Rivian\u2019s R2 midsize SUV in the first half of 2026 and support the launch of Volkswagen models by 2027."

            "article_content": "Over the past decade, as an engineering manager, I\u2019ve seen the tech industry evolve in some ways that I never expected.\n\nThe rise of cloud computing and microservices stands out as one of the most significant shifts. These tools have revolutionized the way we build and scale systems and enable businesses to adapt to changes at a rate that were once unimaginable.\n\nAs I reflect on leading engineering teams globally, one key lesson sticks with me: the teams that find themselves most successful in this environment are those that combine good technology and solid team management.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about following the latest trends\u2014it\u2019s about designing systems that can respond to the actual needs in real time.\n\nMy name is Bharat Ramesh and I am an Engineering Leader and a Software Engineering Manager, and today, I will walk you through on how cloud computing and microservices can help your teams perform better, create innovative solutions and resolve problems that we face every day in our organizations.\n\nThe Cost of Outdated Systems in a World Demanding Speed\n\nFor years, I have seen how teams suffer from the burden of primitive methodologies. Operations that should be accomplished in minutes may consume hours, scalability remains an unattainable goal, and innovation is masked by the technical debt.\n\nThis is frustrating, draining, and let me add, untenable when the technology industry is constantly evolving.\n\nThat\u2019s where cloud computing and microservices come in. These aren\u2019t just simple terms; they are real innovations for overcoming the issues that inhibit our progress. Here\u2019s how these modern solutions tackle the most common pain points:\n\nSlow Deployment Cycles : Microservices allow updates to be deployed independently, cutting down downtime and increasing flexibility.\n\nPoor Scalability : Cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud enable on-demand resource allocation, ensuring systems can grow alongside business needs.\n\nFragile Systems : By breaking monolithic systems into smaller, self-contained components, microservices reduce the risk of one failure taking down the entire application.\n\nLimited Innovation : With infrastructure managed by cloud providers, engineering teams can focus on creating value instead of maintaining servers.\n\nThese shifts have completely transformed the way I lead engineering teams. Embracing these solutions can propel your team into the future.\n\nWhy Cloud and Microservices Are Not Just a Trend \u2013 They Are Essential\n\nWhen I began researching cloud computing and microservices, I wasn\u2019t aiming to become a part of the newest trend\u2014I was in search of solutions that would actually make a difference. And the data? It told me everything I needed to know: These technologies are not mere frills, they are necessities if a business wants to survive in today\u2019s market.\n\nHere\u2019s what stood out:\n\n85% of organizations will operate with a cloud-first principle by 2025 (Gartner), signaling that businesses are prioritizing scalability and efficiency.\n\nCompanies using microservices see up to a 175% increase in deployment frequency (xCube LABS), meaning faster features, faster fixes.\n\nBusinesses leveraging cloud platforms save up to 30% on infrastructure costs (Business Insider), freeing up resources to drive innovation.\n\nEven industry leaders like Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, emphasize this shift, saying, \u201cEvery company is a software company. You have to start thinking and operating like a digital company.\u201d That quote stuck with me because it\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve seen firsthand. So embracing these tools aren\u2019t an option anymore but essential.\n\nThese stats confirmed what I was experiencing in my own projects: cloud computing and microservices don\u2019t just solve problems\u2014they create opportunities.\n\nAddressing Common Pain Points\n\nLike any other engineering leader, I have my own set of troubles, and I\u2019m no exception. From legacy systems to defining the right pace in between speed and security, I have found out that making the right choices and leveraging cloud computing and microservices can help to transform these threats into assets. This is how I have responded to some of the most significant challenges:\n\n1. Overcoming Legacy System Bottlenecks\n\nLegacy systems can feel like anchors. They\u2019re heavy, outdated, and hold your team back. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned: you don\u2019t have to do everything at once.\n\nTake a gradual, strategic approach.\n\nFor example, when we needed to modernize a system at one company, we didn\u2019t overhaul everything. Instead, we containerized key services, tested the waters, and got early wins. Those wins built momentum and reduced the risks associated with bigger changes. The key to making this work? Constant communication with the team and stakeholders to ensure everyone understands the \u201cwhy\u201d behind each step.\n\n2. Moving Fast Without Sacrificing Security\n\nOf course, there\u2019s always a question of speed and security. However, with the right tools, we don\u2019t have to compromise one over the other. At Google we also created the CI/CD pipelines with security checks integrated. This way we were able to identify problems before release while not necessarily slowing down the process.\n\nWe made sure that in our systems, each service was independent of the other. By doing so, if one part of the system was malfunctioning, the other parts of the application continued to operate without errors. The key is to build resilience to the system, which reduces risk and increases credibility with your employees.\n\n3. Scaling on a Budget\n\nBudgets are tight, especially when you need to scale systems. But there\u2019s a smarter way to do it. During one project at Acrelec, we used serverless architecture to scale dynamically with demand. Instead of paying for unused resources, we only paid for what we needed with AWS Lambda.\n\nThis cost-effective approach freed up resources, allowing my team to focus on the stuff that really matters\u2014innovation. Plus, empowering my engineers with cloud training made a huge difference in helping them find cost-effective solutions without compromising on performance.\n\nWhy I Embrace the Cloud: Growth and Scalability with Microservices\n\nI\u2019ve not only seen this transition from traditional systems to cloud-based platforms in my work\u2014I have lived it. According to recent estimates, cloud revenue is expected to grow at a much faster rate than that of traditional systems in the coming five years up to 2025. But even beyond that, I have observed that this change affects how we design and grow systems.\n\nThis is especially true in my work where the integration of cloud computing with microservices has been of great value. Microservices allow me to break down complex applications into smaller, independent components, and the benefits are undeniable:\n\nFaster Deployments : Changes can be done on every single service and not on the whole system at once. This means that we are able to release features or patches easily and with minimal impact.\n\nScalability : I have been able to optimize certain parts of a system rather than the system as a whole and that is more desirable and cost-effective.\n\nResilience : This way if one microservice goes down the rest of the system is not impacted and the system does not degrade thus not inconveniencing the users of the system.\n\nFor example, in the previous project, we encountered variable user traffic. Rather than overloading the system or squander resources, we only scaled the required services by using native cloud technologies. It helped us save time, money and a lot of headaches.\n\nThis isn\u2019t simply a case of organizations moving to the cloud and microservices to follow the latest fad \u2013 it\u2019s about using the right tools to get the job done. Watching my teams do well in this environment has made me confident that this way of working is the way forward for software development.\n\nThe Leadership Factor: Mentorship and Empathy\n\nEngineering leadership is not just about delivering technology advances; it is about creating organizations capable of adapting to a rapidly changing world. As people start to adopt cloud computing and microservices to do their work, leadership becomes even more important.\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve seen how mentorship and empathy can transform teams, especially when navigating complex transitions like adopting new technologies.\n\nHow I\u2019ve Built Mentorship Culture in My Teams\n\nI do believe that leadership has always been one of my strong suits and one of the elements I have always focused on is definitely mentorship. That is not just about transferring knowledge and skills, but to enable and mobilize people to excel and become responsible for their work. I\u2019ve been able to develop a straightforward way of cultivating a culture of mentorship within my teams. Here\u2019s how I do it:\n\nSteps How I Approach it Effect on My Team Identify Strengths I recognize each team member\u2019s unique talents and skills. Boosts confidence and encourages them to play to their strengths. Set Goals I collaborate with them to define clear, achievable objectives. Aligns personal growth with team success, fostering motivation. Provide Guidance I offer support, share insights, and provide helpful resources. Builds trust and equips the team to tackle challenges effectively. Encourage Independence I empower them to take ownership and grow through experience. Cultivates self-reliance and innovation within the team. Celebrate Progress I acknowledge achievements to boost confidence and morale. Enhances morale and creates a positive, growth-oriented culture.\n\nDuring my time at Highmark, I was able to develop a technique of mentoring junior developers while I was still in the company. I wasn\u2019t just training them in AngularJS and React; I was coaching them on how to solve most problems independently. In a world of clouds and microservices, being able to rely on team members to be able to step up and solve problems is priceless.\n\nFurthermore, during one of my projects, while we were shifting towards cloud-native solutions the whole team faced a steep learning process. Instead of pushing harder, I made sure they had the resources and time to adapt. I also made sure every milestone we achieved should be celebrated. This will surely build up morale and help the team to keep on going\n\nLooking Ahead: A Future of Cloud and AI in the Technological Industry\n\nGlancing towards the future, I firmly believe that cloud computing coupled with microservices and AI will be the game-changer. For instance, Generative AI is already being used in the generation of code and testing of the same, thus increasing the rate of delivery. I have had my first experience with these tools and the impact is clear: my teams can focus more on problem-solving while AI handles the repetitive work.\n\nDuring my time exploring cloud and AI technologies, I had the opportunity to dive into courses from Databricks, where I got insights on how these tools can be combined to improve data and pattern understanding. The possibilities for using AI to make data-driven decisions have never been greater, implementing these solutions is simpler than ever.\n\nThese are only the beginning, and I\u2019m looking forward to the future where this technology can take us.\n\nTake the Leap\n\nTechnology is an ever evolving environment and full of challenges, but with the right approach and attitude the opportunities are vast. If you are an engineering manager or a developer in the making, understanding the concept of cloud computing and microservices can help you achieve success at scale.\n\nReady to level up?
