            "article_content": "An Air Force veteran has made shocking claims about UFOs and alien retrieval programs long-rumored to be operated by the US government.\n\nJake Barber said he was working for the government to assist downed craft when one night, the 'communication process and procedure was modified' and he witnessed something that he believes was of extraterrestrial origin.\n\nHe was told to fly a helicopter to a specific area when came 150 feet from an 'egg-shaped' object with no engine or thermal signals.\n\n'I saw an egg, a white egg,' the pilot explained. 'It's inconsistent with anything I'd ever seen before,' Barber told NewsNation.\n\nHis next order was to retrieve it from the ground, which he said was when he knew for sure the craft was not of this world.\n\n'I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary,' the pilot said.\n\n'Over the last couple of years, it's been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP task force that what we were working with that night was, in fact, NHI [non-human intelligence] and it was not a unique experience,' he said.\n\nUAP stands for 'unidentified anomalous phenomena' and is a term used by the Department of Defense to describe mysterious objects in the sky.\n\nThree high-level military veterans are said to corroborate Barber's story, according to NewsNation.\n\nJake Barber, now a chief helicopter pilot in California, said he has witnessed alien craft while working for a secret UFO retrieval program\n\nHe spoke with NewsNation special network correspondent Ross Coulthart in his first whistleblower interview.\n\nWhen asked exactly how he knew the 'egg' was of alien origin, Barber said: 'Just visually looking at the object on the ground, you could tell that it was extraordinary and anomalous. It was it was not human.\n\nBarber's LinkedIn profile states he is a 'disabled veteran,' but the account does not list his years in the Air Force.\n\nThe page shows that he is from California where he works as a chief pilot at San Joaquin Helicopters & Coastal Helicopters.\n\nThe full interview with Barber, titled 'Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower,' is set to air on Saturday, January 18th at 8pm ET.\n\nBarber's description matched another witness report from 1957 when two Civil Aeronautics Administration controllers in the tower at New Mexico's Kirtland Air Force Base saw 'an egg-shaped object.'\n\nM. Kaser and E. G. Brink claimed they witnessed a white light traveling eastwards across the runway, left, then crossed other runways and areas of the airfield.\n\nThey claimed the mysterious object did not have wings, a tail or a fuselage, and was elongated vertically.\n\nMany military personnel claimed to have witnessed UFOs. This image, obtained April 28, 2020, was taken by Navy pilots in 2017. Navy Cmdr David Fravor, who saw it, testified under oath in a hearing where he discussed the experience\n\nAnd it appeared to be 12 to 20 feet tall, according to a report in UFO Evidence.\n\nThe men reported the object was about the size of an automobile standing on its nose, and had a single white light at its base.\n\n'When the object was about 3000 feet ENE of the tower, it stopped completely and hovered for about a minute,' reads the case report.\n\n'Then it began moving again, slowly at first, but then suddenly climbing at an extremely rapid rate of speed until it disappeared into the overcast sky.\n\n'The object was in clear view at all time, with no intervening obstructions, according to the two men.'\n\nThey requested the radar control team track the object as it moved east, with radar showing it turning south at very high speeds 'until it reached the vicinity of the Albuquerque Low-Frequency Range Station, where it circled for several minutes.'\n\nThe object was then said to circle back to the Air Force base and follow behind a plane that had just taken off if to avoid detection."

            "article_content": "Ramy Awad saw old photos and stuffed animals when he visited an abandoned Italian town with two friends.\n\nFor a vacation to Italy, Ramy Awad wanted an adventure. So he picked Fossa, a town deep in the middle of the country that was abandoned after a 2009 earthquake. But things quickly went sideways for the 35-year-old and two friends he brought with him.\n\nIt took the group almost three days to find the town, with GPS leading them in circles. When they finally arrived late at night and got ready to settle in, they heard strange voices. They didn\u2019t know if they were real or imagined, but nobody wanted to leave the tent to investigate. In the morning, they woke up to the sound of a drone that followed them for the next three days.\n\nAt some point, Awad wondered if he should have settled for the Leaning Tower of Pisa. \u201cMy least favorite part was getting chased by drones,\" said Awad, a content creator based in New York City. \u201cThat\u2019s something I will never forget.\"\n\nAmericans have been visiting ghost towns for years, but usually for an afternoon. Lately travelers have been planning extended stays in abandoned towns, seeking adventure or an opportunity to disconnect. Some are discovering that ghost towns in heavier doses can be grim.\n\nThere are more than 3,800 deserted towns across the U.S., according to Geotab, a company that provides data analytics, including GPS location. While most ghost towns remain vacant, some have restored their remaining hotels, seeking to transform them into more luxurious or family-friendly destinations.\n\nPeople who live near the ghost town Shaniko, Ore., get together for a potluck with live music once a month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got people that are staying for several days now, instead of just people wandering through, taking pictures and leaving,\" said Scott Marrs, general manager of a hotel in ghost town Shaniko, Ore., that reopened in 2023 after being abandoned for 16 years.\n\nPrice is a selling point. The cost of a ghost-a-away can be anywhere from $50 to over $300 per night, depending on location. Some travelers say they quickly realized there wasn\u2019t enough to do to fill the time or that the paranormal activity that often is a draw was a little too real.\n\nCimcie Nichols and her best friend were looking for a fun place to go for the Fourth of July weekend. While listening to a podcast, they heard about renting a cabin in a ghost town called Gunslinger Gulch for around $250 a night. Intrigued, they decided to check it out.\n\n\u201cI have not done ghost tourism before but I do love spooky movies,\" Nichols, 44, said of trips to locations associated with death or the supernatural. \u201cSo we thought, \u2018Why don\u2019t we spend the night?\u2019\"\n\nCimcie Nichols, right, loves spooky movies.\n\nWhen they arrived at the town on the outskirts of Anaconda, Montana, they joined a ghost hunt using a \u201cghost box\"\u2014a device designed to let spirits communicate through FM radio frequencies. The two were having a great time until that night.\n\nWhile sleeping in their 1880s-style cabins, Nichols said she felt something trying to pull her out of bed, but she couldn\u2019t move. When she discovered the next day her friend didn\u2019t have a similar experience, Nichols was ready to go.\n\nThey stayed another night, but only because they had already paid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like immersive theater but there\u2019s no safe word,\" said Nichols, owner of a beverage business called Hatchet Granny, from Los Angeles.\n\nNichols said she probably wouldn\u2019t return because of her experience. \u201cOnce you\u2019re in the middle of it, and it\u2019s the real world\u2026you might chicken out,\" she said.\n\nThe owner of Gunslinger Gulch, Karen Broussard, who bought the 52-acre property with her three children, said they have traced the town\u2019s history back to 1864, when it was a stagecoach stop for miners and prison transports. \u201cParanormal activity is quite normal around here,\" said Broussard, who often hosts overnight investigations for guests at the ranch.\n\nNot all ghost town stays are a bargain.\n\nJennifer Broome relaxed in a hammock next to the hot springs at a ghost town resort in Colorado.\n\nJennifer Broome stayed one night at a luxury resort called Dunton Hot Springs in an abandoned town in Colorado in 2022. Within 24 hours, she hiked up a mountain, got a massage at the spa, and relaxed in a hammock next to the hot springs.\n\nAlthough she wished she stayed an extra night or two, she didn\u2019t think she would make it past three days. \u201cA three-night stay is kind of that sweet spot,\" said Broome, a 52-year-old freelance journalist in Denver. \u201cYou\u2019re not staying so long that you\u2019re going \u2018ah now I\u2019m bored.\u2019\"\n\nStays at the resort range from $1,165 to $4,700 a night, depending on season, accommodation and number of guests.\n\nAlex Sarha and his wife, Nicole, had passed through Shaniko, the ghost town in Oregon once known as the wool capital of the world. After the town\u2019s hotel reopened in 2023, they returned for a weekend.\n\nSince then, they have stayed several times. During one trip, they decided to test the paranormal rumors using a ghost-hunting app. At first, Nicole was skeptical, refusing to believe in anything unusual. But when their car keys went missing overnight and later turned up hidden in Alex\u2019s camera case, she became more open to the possibility that something strange could be happening.\n\n\u201cIt has the creep factor, but it\u2019s the cool creep factor,\" said Alex, 58, who works for a trucking company.\n\nThe Shaniko Hotel in Oregon.\n\nTheir most recent visit in October was quieter. There were no paranormal events but dining options were limited. The hotel\u2019s cafe\u2014the only food place in town\u2014is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., so they had to pack their own dinners and snacks. That\u2019s why they haven\u2019t stayed for longer than a weekend.\n\nStill, the couple said they enjoyed the lack of distractions and the opportunity to disconnect as the hotel has no TVs and slow Wi-Fi reception.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever run out of things to do,\" said Alex. \u201cEven if you just sat with a book.\"\n\nAwad, who went to the abandoned Italian town, said he would return in a heartbeat. His friends, however, weren\u2019t so enthusiastic. They couldn\u2019t shake the strange voices, one of them had a nasty encounter with sleep paralysis, and none of them liked being watched by a mysterious drone 24/7.\n\n\u201cI would prefer for [spooky] things to happen,\" said Awad. \u201cIt makes the adventure more fun, more exciting or memorable.\"\n\nFossa, a town in Italy, was abandoned after a 2009 earthquake.\n\nWrite to Kailyn Rhone at kailyn.rhone@wsj.com"

            "article_content": "When we think of artificial intelligence (AI), data science and the potential real-world impact of these rapidly developing fields, we tend to look to the future\u2014particularly when it comes to health.\n\nIn life sciences, AI is already having a significant impact on our ability to bring new medicines to patients, from accelerating drug discovery to supporting the early detection of disease, improving clinical research and shaping our understanding of complex biology.\n\nAt AstraZeneca, an early adopter of AI and data science for healthcare, these tools are helping scientists in their quest to find life-changing new treatments for some of the world's most challenging diseases, in order to transform patient outcomes.\n\nJim Weatherall is the Chief Data Scientist, Biopharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca. For the past five years, working closely with partners across the organization, he has played a key role in integrating data science and AI into drug discovery and development\u2014from answering specific scientific questions to improving the ways of working for chemists, biologists, and clinicians who are striving to solve them.\n\n\"Biology is still an unsolved problem,\" Weatherall says, \"It's characterized by a lot of uncertainty and a lot of variety\u2014variety between individuals, between cells in the body, variety between what the proteins in those cells do and how they talk to each other.\n\n\"There's still so much we don't understand. However, the good news is that we have extensive historical data from experiments and clinical trials. We're also continuously generating new data, more than ever before, and can use AI to turn it into value for patients at unprecedented speed and scale, in order to deliver much needed biomedical insights.\"\n\nOne of the key ways in which AI has transformed AstraZeneca's research is in the discovery and design of drugs. Historically, medicines have been discovered and designed manually by scientists in the laboratory\u2014this needs to be rigorous and deliberate, but can often be a slow and painstaking process, contributing to the lengthy development process of new medicines.\n\nNow, AstraZeneca chemists are armed with AI tools inspired by \"reinforcement learning.\" This technique is, in part, inspired and borrowed from its success in other tasks\u2014such as applications where computers can exceed human levels of performance in winning at games such as chess and Go.\n\n\"In reinforcement learning, you're asking AI to maximize a score, to find as many different outcomes as possible and choose the best one\u2014which is something that can be applied just as well to the design of a molecule that might one day become a new medicine,\" Weatherall explains.\n\nIt means that instead of synthesizing hundreds of molecules by hand, machine learning tools can quickly sift through thousands of possibilities, highlighting the most promising candidates for further study.\n\nIt also allows researchers to take a more \"zoomed-out perspective,\" Weatherall says, \"to help us make better scientific decisions, so that we can have a higher probability of success, and the potential for medicines to reach patients faster.\"\n\nGoing forward, AstraZeneca researchers are applying that same approach to different classes of medicines, such as antibodies, which are often used to treat diseases."

            "article_content": "Circa 1945: Astronomer Dr. Edwin Powell Hubble sitting in a chair at a desk reading a journal. A staff member at Mt. Wilson Observatory, he was the first scientist to offer observational evidence supporting the theory, now known as Hubble's Law, of the expansion of the universe.\n\nIf we could go back 101 years, we would encounter a time when scientists still thought the Milky Way was the entirety of our universe. But, if we went back 100 years instead, we would find most scientists agreeing that this isn't true. Somewhere in between, humans realized the universe is much larger than our Milky Way \u2014 that the spiral nebulas visible through telescopes were, in fact, other galaxies in their own right. The scale of the cosmos had expanded dramatically virtually overnight.\n\nAccording to historical records, we have one man to thank for this: Edwin Hubble. That's certainly partly the truth, but he couldn't have done it without the genius of others around him who paved the way for his discovery.\n\n\"It's easy to romanticize Hubble and his discovery of the universe beyond the Milky Way galaxy , but his work really stood on the shoulders of a number of people,\" said Jeff Rich, an astronomer at the Carnegie Science Observatories, in a press conference at the 245th meeting of the American Astronomical Society on in Maryland.\n\nThat Rich was presenting the story of Edwin Hubble at the January 2025 AAS meeting was symbolic, for it was at the 33rd meeting of the AAS, a century ago on January 1, 1925 in Washington, D.C., that Hubble's work was officially presented for the first time.\n\nRich describes the discovery of the universe beyond the Milky Way as being a revelation centuries in the making, discussing how our understanding of our place in the cosmos gradually coalesced in time with new discoveries. The two people whose shoulders Hubble stood on the most, though, were Henrietta Swan Leavitt and Harlow Shapley .\n\nThe most important stars in the universe\n\nLeavitt worked at Harvard College Observatory as a \"computer\" who would analyze photographic plates taken by Harvard's telescopes. In particular, Leavitt would scrutinize images of the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds , and had identified 1,800 variable stars within them. In two papers written by Leavitt in 1908 and 1912, she was able to determine that many of these variable stars had a distinctive period\u2013luminosity relation. In other words, she realized that the amount of time it took for the stars to regularly pulsate and appear brighter and fainter as they contracted and expanded was dependent upon how luminous they were.\n\nThis was a vital discovery. Suppose you found one of these variables, subsequently called Cepheid variables . You might not know how far away it was, but based on the Cepheid's period of variation, you could calculate how intrinsically luminous the Cepheid was. Then, all you'd need to do to work out how far away the star is would be to compare its true luminosity with how faint it appeared to be in the night sky. Even today, Leavitt's period\u2013luminosity relation is a key concept scientists use when measuring distances in the cosmos..\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

Back at the beginning of the 20th century, telescopes were not powerful enough to resolve individual stars in other galaxies, so spiral galaxies appeared more like spiral smudges, and were referred to as spiral nebulas. Shapley suspected the spiral nebulas to simply be stars forming on the edge of the Milky Way.\n\nShapley's goal was to measure the size of the Milky Way \u2014 and hence the universe as he saw it \u2014 by creating the first official cosmic distance ladder. Cepheid variables that he identified in our galaxy were the first rung. Next were RR Lyrae stars , which are another breed of variable star with a similar period\u2013luminosity relation to Cepheids and whose distances could be calibrated by comparing them to the Cepheid variables. Finally, he used the RR Lyrae variables to calibrate the distance to ordinary massive, luminous stars near the edge of the Milky Way.\n\nShapley determined that the Milky Way was 300,000 light years across, and that our solar system was 50,000 light-years from the center. While today we know the more accurate values are 100,000 light-years and 26,000 light-years, respectively, Shapley's result represented the first use of a cosmic distance ladder. Shapley even took part in the \"Great Debate\" with fellow astronomer Heber Curtis at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C. in April 1920, which discussed the nature of the spiral nebulas. Curtis argued that the spiral nebulas were galaxies in their own right, but said that the Milky Way was only 10,000 light years across. Shapley argued the opposite.\n\nHubble enters the fray\n\nEdwin Hubble joined the Mount Wilson Observatory team in California in 1919, just two years after the observatory\u2019s Hooker Telescope, which was the largest telescope in the world at that time, had seen first light.\n\n\"[Hubble's] breakthrough was made possible by the 100-inch Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson,\u201d said Rich. \u201cHubble was able to make his discovery because he had access to this state-of-the-art technology.\u201d\n\nThe Hooker telescope was the brainchild of the observatory\u2019s director, George Ellery Hale, and was designed to, among other things, solve the spiral nebulae puzzle, thanks to a generous $45,000 gift from Californian philanthropist John Hooker.\n\nBefore we continue, we should also mention one other important character in this story: Milton Humason. Originally hired as a \"mule skinner,\" taking building materials and equipment up Mount Wilson via mule while the observatory was still under construction, he subsequently became the observatory's janitor and then an assistant to the astronomers using it. Humason and Hubble became almost inseparable at the telescope, while Humason made many astronomical discoveries in his own right despite not having a Ph.D., and deserves to share in much of the credit that Hubble receives.\n\nSo, with the stage set, Hubble and Humason set to work observing spiral nebulas with the Hooker telescope. In 1923, they succeeded in taking an image of the Andromeda spiral nebula, Messier 31, and that revealed something very special indeed.\n\n\"Hubble was so excited about this image that he wrote 'VAR!' on the black and white glass plate, because he had seen evidence of a Cepheid variable,\" said Rich. That Cepheid variable star became known simply as \u2018V1\u2019. \"He knew, because of work done by Henrietta Leavitt and Harlow Shapley, that this meant he could measure the distance to a spiral nebula for the first time.\"\n\nAnd measure it he did. He calculated a distance of 930,000 light-years, which is less than half the real distance of 2.5 million light-years, but the limitations of Hubble's rudimentary calculation notwithstanding (the cosmic distance ladder is still being refined even today), it clearly showed that the Andromeda spiral existed beyond the confines of the 300,000 light-years that Shapley measured for the Milky Way. Messier 31 was not a spiral nebula. It was a spiral galaxy .\n\nHubble Space Telescope images of V1 (inset), which was the Cepheid variable star in the Andromeda spiral that allowed Edwin Hubble to measure the spiral's distance and prove that it and other spirals were \"island universes \"in their own right. (Image credit: NASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Project (STScI/AURA)/Robert Gendler)\n\nHubble wrote to Shapley, informing him of his discovery. When Shapley read his letter, he commented, \"Here is the letter that destroyed my universe.\"\n\nHubble 'leaked' the news of his discovery to the New York Times in November of 1924, which is why the presentation at the AAS the following January, actually given by astronomer Henry Norris Russell and not Hubble himself, was only the official reveal \u2014 unofficially, though, people already knew about it.\n\nToday, we take for granted that the universe is filled with galaxies, some spirals like the Milky Way and Andromeda, some giant ellipticals , and others tiny dwarfs. At last count, up to 2 trillion galaxies are estimated to exist within the visible universe. And yet, Rich comments how Hubble's epochal discovery was actually relatively recent.\n\n\"One hundred years is not that far away,\" he said. Indeed, there are a few people in the world even older than that, born in a time before we knew other galaxies existed. \"This is really a lesson of how much things have changed and how discoveries can come at us fast.\"\n\nToday, the photographic plate that captures the Cepheid variable V1, with Hubble's scrawled \"VAR!\" in the corner, is a precious relic of discovery, the kind of thing a scientific Indiana Jones might go in search of in a thousand years' time. Fortunately, you don't have to embark on quite such an arduous journey to find it. Usually kept under lock and key, the plate has been let out for air and is currently on display for a few months at the Mapping the Infinite: Cosmologies Across Cultures exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum.\n\nAs for Hubble, he didn't stop there. His subsequent tuning-fork diagram of the shapes of galaxies remains a classic teaching tool for astronomers, and even though the evolution of galaxies that the tuning fork depicts is back to front, professional astronomers still use the tuning fork's nomenclature of \"early\" and \"late\" galaxies.\n\nThen, in 1929, Hubble revealed that almost all the other galaxies in the universe were moving away from us, based partly on redshift measurements by fellow astronomer Vesto Slipher, and in line with theoretical work by the Belgian physicist and priest Georges Lema\u00eetre, who derived what has become known as the Hubble\u2013Lema\u00eetre law describing the expansion of the universe ."

            "article_content": "Jonathan Lachman, the previous head of special projects at OpenAI, recently left to join a new artificial intelligence research lab founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, according to two people familiar with the discussions. It\u2019s the most high-profile hire Murati has made since leaving OpenAI in September last year to start the much-hyped venture, which is focused on the exploration of so-called artificial general intelligence.\n\nMurati has poached roughly 10 researchers and engineers in total so far from competitors including OpenAI, Character AI, and Google DeepMind. Her startup is still in its early stages\u2014it doesn\u2019t have a name, nor a firm product direction, according to two people familiar with the company.\n\nMurati and Lachman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for OpenAI confirmed Lachman\u2019s departure.\n\nMurati departed OpenAI less than a year after CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the company\u2019s board of directors in late 2023. In the turmoil that followed, the board briefly appointed Murati, who then served as the company\u2019s chief technology officer, as interim CEO.\n\nThe move was a blow to Altman. \u201cI was like, that feels really bad,\u201d he told podcaster Lex Fridman last March. He described Murati\u2019s promotion as \u201cthe low point\u201d of the dramatic leadership crisis that briefly consumed OpenAI. Less than a week later and after more than 730 OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Altman was reinstated as CEO.\n\nAltman and Murati continued to work closely together at OpenAI after the incident. \u201cShe did a great job during that weekend in a lot of chaos,\u201d Altman told Fridman on the podcast. When Murati stepped down from the company 10 months later, she thanked Altman in her goodbye letter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes,\u201d she wrote in the note to OpenAI employees, which she later posted on X. She added that she was \u201cstepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration.\u201d A month later, Reuters reported that Murati was trying to raise over $100 million to fund a mysterious new company, though that figure had not been finalized.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s vice president of research, Barret Zoph, and chief research officer, Bob McGrew, both left around the same time as Murati. Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and chief scientist, followed suit in May of last year. He went on to found Safe Superintelligence, a startup focused on AI safety. Within three months, Sutskever\u2019s startup had raised $1 billion. Anthropic, a major OpenAI competitor, was also founded by former OpenAI executives and has raised billions of dollars in funding, including $8 billion from Amazon."

            "article_content": "> Tech\n\nPoornima Rao, the mother of whistleblower Suchir Balaji, has accused OpenAI of being responsible for her son's death. She claims the company killed him to conceal information they wanted to keep hidden.\n\nIn an interview with Tucker Carlson, the mother of OpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji, Poornima Ramarao, reiterated that her son\u2019s death was not a suicide and alleged major lapses in the investigation. The San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, however, ruled Balaji's death as a suicide.\n\nWhen asked if she believed her son could have taken his own life, Ramarao responded, \u201cHe celebrated his birthday the day before he died. What more evidence do we need to show he was in a happy mood?\u201d She added that Balaji had even accepted a birthday gift from his father on the day of his death.\n\nALSO SEE: Apple AI Falters: News Summaries Disabled in Beta Software After Incorrect News Alerts\n\nRamarao recounted how she learned of her son's passing, saying, \u201cI knew my son was dead by seeing the white van,\u201d and expressed frustration that the police did not inform her properly, making excuses instead. \u201cIt took them 14 minutes to determine the cause of death and tell me it was a suicide. Later that evening, they returned the keys to me and told me I could pick up the body the next day.\"\n\n\u201cMy son had documents that incriminated OpenAI. They attacked him and killed him,\u201d Ramarao stated. She also mentioned that some documents were missing. \u201cEveryone is being silenced, and no one is willing to speak the truth. Even the attorneys have been pressured into saying it was a suicide,\u201d she added.\n\nElon Musk shared Ramarao\u2019s interview with Carlson, commenting, \u201cExtremely concerning.\u201d\n\nTucker texts Congressman Ro Khanna live during his interview with the mother of likely murdered OpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji asking him to support a full investigation into his death. https://t.co/hmUazIvdRl pic.twitter.com/edqbmv2j8O \u2014 Tucker Carlson Network (@TCNetwork) January 15, 2025\n\nFor the unversed, before his death, Balaji raised concerns about OpenAI violating copyright laws in an interview with The New York Times. His mother, Ramarao, made similar claims in a previous post on X, alleging that Balaji\u2019s apartment was ransacked and there were signs of a struggle in the bathroom. She suggested that he may have been attacked there, based on blood spots, and described his death as a \"cold-blooded murder\" that authorities had ruled a suicide.\n\nALSO SEE: Tim Cook Reveals How Apple Watch's Fall Detection Saved His Father\u2019s Life"

            "article_content": "JUSTICE FOR SUCHIR, a cryptocurrency token, which aims to support the legal effort to investigate the death of OpenAI whistle-blower Suchir Balaji, has lost most of its value within a month after being minted.\n\nThe token was first minted on December 13 on the Solana blockchain. Per CoinMarketCap analytics, it touched a high of almost $0.009 on December 30, and subsequently dropped to approximately $0.0019 on January 17, a drop of 74.50%.\n\nThough likely not intended to be an investment vehicle, the drastic fall in price raises questions about why such a volatile asset is being used for legal fundraising and how transparency will be ensured.\n\nMr. Balaji had voiced ethical concerns about OpenAI\u2019s alleged scraping of copyrighted works to train its AI products like ChatGPT. He also spoke to The New York Times about his findings in 2024 after leaving the company.\n\nThe 26-year-old was found dead inside his apartment in San Francisco on November 26, per local media reports. While initially reported as a suicide, his mother, Ms. Poornima Rao, is seeking an investigation into the death as she believes her son has been murdered.\n\nMs. Rao endorsed the JUSTICE FOR SUCHIR campaign, as well as the token, and asked for support to raise funds to help the family get justice for Balaji.\n\nThe SUCHIR token [token address: ByXTsen3ftsd7SsqgXpSZqrEeoMV8Smhz1vox9j6pump] has a self-reported market cap of $2.11 million and a self-reported circulating supply of 999.92 million SUCHIR, per CoinMarketCap.\n\nIt is not clear how the founding team of the SUCHIR token is related to the family, or who is leading the project.\n\nOn CoinMarketCap, the token was linked to the @SuchirJustice account on X, which said it was \u201csupporting Suchir\u2019s family and legacy through crypto\u201d.\n\nHowever, the official website linked to the crypto token lacks any verified information about the founding team, token developers, the economics of the token and its distribution, and how donations will specifically be accounted for.\n\nThese are key details that investors and traders should be able to easily access, so that they can assess the trustworthiness of a crypto project and how technically and financially sound it is.\n\n\u201cYour support will help Suchir\u2019s family cover the costs of a private investigation and legal fees as they pursue the truth about his tragic death. Every contribution brings us closer to uncovering what really happened and ensuring accountability,\u201d said the justiceforsuchir.org website.\n\nThe website also featured two tweets supporting Mr. Balaji, with AI-generated images of a protest for the whistleblower.\n\nApart from the SUCHIR token endorsed by Ms. Rao, there were also many copycat crypto tokens referencing Mr. Balaji and his family. (Most of these are likely scams.)\n\nOpenAI reacts to allegations\n\nWhile OpenAI earlier acknowledged Mr. Balaji\u2019s death and expressed sympathies to his loved ones, the company\u2019s newsroom account on X released a new statement on January 17.\n\nThis came after Ms. Rao was featured on The Tucker Carlson Show this week and said she believed her son\u2019s death was due to homicide.\n\n\u201cSuchir was a valued member of our team and we are still heartbroken by his passing. We continue to feel his loss deeply. We\u2019ve reached out to the San Francisco Police Department and have offered our assistance if it\u2019s needed. Law enforcement are the right authorities in this situation, and we trust them to continue sharing updates as needed. Out of respect, we won\u2019t be commenting further,\u201d stated OpenAI.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk, who is locked in a legal struggle with OpenAI, has also voiced support for Ms. Rao\u2019s cause.\n\n\u201cIf there is any possibility that this was murder (and the evidence is at best unclear), then it deserves a full investigation!\u201d he posted on X on January 16."

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter.\n\nLooking to keep your content fresh and relevant in 2025?\n\nThis will help. Today, Pinterest has launched its second annual \u201cPinterest Palette\u201d report, which provides an overview of key color trends in the app, based on research conducted for its Pinterest Predicts trends listing.\n\nAs explained by Pinterest:\n\n\u201cThe Pinterest Palette offers marketers inspiration driven by what over half a billion Pinners are searching, saving, and shopping for each month. Our in-house creative and insights teams worked hand-in-hand to map Pinterest Predicts trends and color clusters against first-party platform Pin color data. Looking at actions like saves, we were able to see which colors are driving engagement over time.\u201d\n\nThe report identifies the colors most likely to resonate with audiences this year, which Pinterest\u2019s team has narrowed down to five key hues.\n\nEach color gets its own overview, which includes Pin examples, hex codes, and a listing of tags related to that shade.\n\nIt\u2019s a good-looking report, which likely means that Pinterest has got the colors right, and they do feel fresh and vibrant, even if a bit Christmas-y.\n\n\u201cBrands can tap into the colors shaping the year ahead for mood boards, product launches, or creative campaigns. For example, health-focused condiment brand Primal Kitchen referenced Pinterest Predicts and the Pinterest Palette for their Colorful Kitchen Tour last year. Fusing the 2024 Pinterest Palette with their core brand colors, Primal Kitchen launched new dipping sauces with Predicts-inspired \u201cKitschens\u201d pop-ups in three major cities.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one way that you can use this insight, while it might also give you the spark of inspiration you need to refresh your branding efforts for the year ahead, with trending color tones that align with your audience.\n\nOr you might go with something else entirely, and that might also align with your customers\u2019 interests. There are no prescriptive rules here, but it is worth checking out Pinterest\u2019s color trends, and considering what they might mean for your brand efforts in 2025.\n\nYou can download Pinterest\u2019s \u201c2025 Pinterest Palette\u201d report here.\n\nRecommended Reading"

            "article_content": "When we think of artificial intelligence (AI), data science and the potential real-world impact of these rapidly developing fields, we tend to look to the future\u2014particularly when it comes to health.\n\nIn life sciences, AI is already having a significant impact on our ability to bring new medicines to patients, from accelerating drug discovery to supporting the early detection of disease, improving clinical research and shaping our understanding of complex biology.\n\nAt AstraZeneca, an early adopter of AI and data science for healthcare, these tools are helping scientists in their quest to find life-changing new treatments for some of the world's most challenging diseases, in order to transform patient outcomes.\n\nJim Weatherall is the Chief Data Scientist, Biopharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca. For the past five years, working closely with partners across the organization, he has played a key role in integrating data science and AI into drug discovery and development\u2014from answering specific scientific questions to improving the ways of working for chemists, biologists, and clinicians who are striving to solve them.\n\n\"Biology is still an unsolved problem,\" Weatherall says, \"It's characterized by a lot of uncertainty and a lot of variety\u2014variety between individuals, between cells in the body, variety between what the proteins in those cells do and how they talk to each other.\n\n\"There's still so much we don't understand. However, the good news is that we have extensive historical data from experiments and clinical trials. We're also continuously generating new data, more than ever before, and can use AI to turn it into value for patients at unprecedented speed and scale, in order to deliver much needed biomedical insights.\"\n\nOne of the key ways in which AI has transformed AstraZeneca's research is in the discovery and design of drugs. Historically, medicines have been discovered and designed manually by scientists in the laboratory\u2014this needs to be rigorous and deliberate, but can often be a slow and painstaking process, contributing to the lengthy development process of new medicines.\n\nNow, AstraZeneca chemists are armed with AI tools inspired by \"reinforcement learning.\" This technique is, in part, inspired and borrowed from its success in other tasks\u2014such as applications where computers can exceed human levels of performance in winning at games such as chess and Go.\n\n\"In reinforcement learning, you're asking AI to maximize a score, to find as many different outcomes as possible and choose the best one\u2014which is something that can be applied just as well to the design of a molecule that might one day become a new medicine,\" Weatherall explains.\n\nIt means that instead of synthesizing hundreds of molecules by hand, machine learning tools can quickly sift through thousands of possibilities, highlighting the most promising candidates for further study.\n\nIt also allows researchers to take a more \"zoomed-out perspective,\" Weatherall says, \"to help us make better scientific decisions, so that we can have a higher probability of success, and the potential for medicines to reach patients faster.\"\n\nGoing forward, AstraZeneca researchers are applying that same approach to different classes of medicines, such as antibodies, which are often used to treat diseases."

            "article_content": "Jonathan Lachman, the previous head of special projects at OpenAI, recently left to join a new artificial intelligence research lab founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, according to two people familiar with the discussions. It\u2019s the most high-profile hire Murati has made since leaving OpenAI in September last year to start the much-hyped venture, which is focused on the exploration of so-called artificial general intelligence.\n\nMurati has poached roughly 10 researchers and engineers in total so far from competitors including OpenAI, Character AI, and Google DeepMind. Her startup is still in its early stages\u2014it doesn\u2019t have a name, nor a firm product direction, according to two people familiar with the company.\n\nMurati and Lachman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for OpenAI confirmed Lachman\u2019s departure.\n\nMurati departed OpenAI less than a year after CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the company\u2019s board of directors in late 2023. In the turmoil that followed, the board briefly appointed Murati, who then served as the company\u2019s chief technology officer, as interim CEO.\n\nThe move was a blow to Altman. \u201cI was like, that feels really bad,\u201d he told podcaster Lex Fridman last March. He described Murati\u2019s promotion as \u201cthe low point\u201d of the dramatic leadership crisis that briefly consumed OpenAI. Less than a week later and after more than 730 OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Altman was reinstated as CEO.\n\nAltman and Murati continued to work closely together at OpenAI after the incident. \u201cShe did a great job during that weekend in a lot of chaos,\u201d Altman told Fridman on the podcast. When Murati stepped down from the company 10 months later, she thanked Altman in her goodbye letter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes,\u201d she wrote in the note to OpenAI employees, which she later posted on X. She added that she was \u201cstepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration.\u201d A month later, Reuters reported that Murati was trying to raise over $100 million to fund a mysterious new company, though that figure had not been finalized.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s vice president of research, Barret Zoph, and chief research officer, Bob McGrew, both left around the same time as Murati. Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and chief scientist, followed suit in May of last year. He went on to found Safe Superintelligence, a startup focused on AI safety. Within three months, Sutskever\u2019s startup had raised $1 billion. Anthropic, a major OpenAI competitor, was also founded by former OpenAI executives and has raised billions of dollars in funding, including $8 billion from Amazon."

Tobias H\u00fcttl, Head of Design Studio at Porsche, kindly sat down with me to answer a few questions on this automotive design collaboration for Honor's new Magic 7 series.\n\nHonor and Porsche have collaborated for three generations of smartphones now, starting with the Honor Magic V2, followed by the Porsche Design Magic 6. The newest Honor Magic7 RSR from Porshe Design however takes this to new levels, yet continues the iconic hexagonal camera design trend that we\u2019ve seen on previous Porsche X Honor handsets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was invited by Honor to the stunning resort of Bled in Slovenia this week to see first-hand the new Magic 7 AI devices (including the indestructible Magic 7 Lite), and to experience the company's innovations in advanced durable AI technology. This Porsche handset is not only exquisite, but ignites an existing trend of merging premium sports car-inspired design with the latest tech. Tobias H\u00fcttl shares the Magic7 RSR colour selection and design process.\n\nImage 1 of 1\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nDo you have a favourite aspect of the RSR 7 phone? A favourite design element?\n\nI like the fact that you can hold it in your hand and it feels premium and special, right? Without needing a visual of it. So I think that's very nice. And I also like the sharp edges that you can feel around the camera unit at the back, I think that's adding this very central quality that helps people appreciate the project.\n\nCan you tell me a bit about the colours of the Honor Magic7 RSR Porsche design?\n\nThe two colours that we have are Agate Grey and Provence. With those colours, we hoped to differentiate quite strongly between customer choices. Provence is much more subtle than the Frozen Berry Metallic [this was a colour option available with the Magic 6] which is more vibrant, and as the name suggests, more like an ice cream. But the Provence is something that\u2019s toned down, less reflective, with less saturation. I think it's also a little bit more bluish compared to the Frozen Berry.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe've tried different directions, and then the choice finally fell on the Provence. We think it's a bit of a mystery colour, and it's something that's still subtle, but at the same time, I think that's something that we like a lot about it. It's not resembling a super strong race car colour or anything. It's elegant still, even though it's something that people can recognize and see as something special.\n\nIs there a reason why you didn't opt for turbonite as a colour choice for the phone?\n\n[This is the popular grey Pantone hue that was made exclusively for Porsche].\n\nSo the turbonite is interesting because it's dedicated to Porsche's turbo collection, right? So with our phone not being a turbo phone, it would not have been a very consistent story.\n\nRead more: Porsche's turbonite is the most surprising colour trend of NYFW\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nImage 2 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage 3 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nImage 4 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nImage 5 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nIs this handset trying to sell a smartphone to a Porsche owner, or a Porsche to Honor customers?\n\nIt can work both ways. I mean, in the end, I think that the product should stand for itself. It should have a quality for itself, character for itself. There is a connection, for sure, with everything that's in the Porsche cosmos and with the Porsche DNA as well. We think that it's grown up enough to hold its own justification and attraction as a product.\n\nHow did you work with Honor over decisions such as colour, material, and form?\n\nIn the beginning, with the ideation phase, we're very broad. So we are looking into all different kinds of directions and ideas, but then there are certain colours which work in certain settings and maybe not in others. Some things make sense with the design of the car but not so much within the phone world.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWith Honor, we kind of sit down and discuss together what's the common denominator within our understanding of aesthetics, and then we find the right material for the right product. Materials are always something that we are interested in. If you look at the phones, materials are one of the differentiating factors.\n\nDid you seek any feedback from customers and fans of the brand?\n\nThere's lots of input from all kinds of dimensions. So there are customer inputs, and there's also market inputs that we have within our broader corporation, but eventually, we made a decision with what colour to go with on an informed basis.\n\nWere there any big design decisions that you couldn't agree on?\n\nIt's always like that. I think that\u2019s the nature of design. You come up with a lot of ideas, but then again, I think it's very important to also have restrictions in the design process. So it was the balance between something that people think of without any kind of limitations, and that's what's possible on the other side, and in the end, you find the best solution with a product that's feasible and aesthetically pleasing. There are mostly technical limitations. Things like user habits and economics people have that we have to take into account.\n\nImage 1 of 1\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDid Porsche Design have any input on the software within the Magic 7 series?\n\nSo what was important for us on the software part is that we have one design, for hardware and software, and we had a strong impact on the graphics for the user interface buttons as well, to make it a homogeneous experience as a user. There are new software features [compared with the Honor Magic 6] within the new iOS, so we've also taken that into account for the design elements.\n\nDo you feel that the crossover between automotive design and global fashion trends will eventually have the same weight in the smartphone industry?\n\nThat's very interesting. I think that people hold phones very dearly, and I think that's something that everyone has to deal with. So naturally, I think phones and cars are things that people will consider a very attractive product in their minds. So to think about the relationship of those two things is always important.\n\nIs there a colour that you absolutely would not consider for this particular brand of phone?\n\nI think it's always content-specific. It has to fit with the nature of the product and in this case with the RSR 7, I think the two colours that we have address a lot of customer needs. So you can have a buyer who is the subtle type, and the other one might be a bit more of the extrovert type. And I think it's a good mixture of colours. So I would say we keep this open. I wouldn't include all the colours. But logistically it's interesting.\n\nThe new Honor Magic7 RSR phone design incorporates some of Porsche's signature elements, including the hexagonal shape of the camera unit (resembling sports car headlights) and the seamless integration and nods to the aerodynamic aesthetics of the Porsche Taycan Turbo S sports car.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen I asked Tobias which phone colour he preferred out of the two options, he suggested, \"personally, I would just get both\".\n\nIf you're interested in owning this ultra-premium smartphone for yourself, expect to spend a staggering \u00a31,549. This exclusive and limited smartphone will be available soon, but to be notified and register your interest, be sure to head to the Porsche website for all the details."

            "article_content": "Jonathan Lachman, the previous head of special projects at OpenAI, recently left to join a new artificial intelligence research lab founded by former OpenAI executive Mira Murati, according to two people familiar with the discussions. It\u2019s the most high-profile hire Murati has made since leaving OpenAI in September last year to start the much-hyped venture, which is focused on the exploration of so-called artificial general intelligence.\n\nMurati has poached roughly 10 researchers and engineers in total so far from competitors including OpenAI, Character AI, and Google DeepMind. Her startup is still in its early stages\u2014it doesn\u2019t have a name, nor a firm product direction, according to two people familiar with the company.\n\nMurati and Lachman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for OpenAI confirmed Lachman\u2019s departure.\n\nMurati departed OpenAI less than a year after CEO Sam Altman was abruptly fired by the company\u2019s board of directors in late 2023. In the turmoil that followed, the board briefly appointed Murati, who then served as the company\u2019s chief technology officer, as interim CEO.\n\nThe move was a blow to Altman. \u201cI was like, that feels really bad,\u201d he told podcaster Lex Fridman last March. He described Murati\u2019s promotion as \u201cthe low point\u201d of the dramatic leadership crisis that briefly consumed OpenAI. Less than a week later and after more than 730 OpenAI employees threatened to quit, Altman was reinstated as CEO.\n\nAltman and Murati continued to work closely together at OpenAI after the incident. \u201cShe did a great job during that weekend in a lot of chaos,\u201d Altman told Fridman on the podcast. When Murati stepped down from the company 10 months later, she thanked Altman in her goodbye letter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes,\u201d she wrote in the note to OpenAI employees, which she later posted on X. She added that she was \u201cstepping away because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration.\u201d A month later, Reuters reported that Murati was trying to raise over $100 million to fund a mysterious new company, though that figure had not been finalized.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s vice president of research, Barret Zoph, and chief research officer, Bob McGrew, both left around the same time as Murati. Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI cofounder and chief scientist, followed suit in May of last year. He went on to found Safe Superintelligence, a startup focused on AI safety. Within three months, Sutskever\u2019s startup had raised $1 billion. Anthropic, a major OpenAI competitor, was also founded by former OpenAI executives and has raised billions of dollars in funding, including $8 billion from Amazon."

China has been making agile policies that allow fast proof of concept, [as well as] failure and retry, which facilitates really quick iterations,\u201d said Ann Shi Yu, vice-president of autonomous driving company Pony.ai.\n\n\u201cThe competition in China is fiercer, which forces [companies] to progress,\u201d Shi said, noting that in the US only Alphabet-backed Waymo is capable of operating hundreds of fully autonomous robotaxis on public roads. In China, there is \u201cdefinitely more than one company doing that\u201d.\n\nPony.ai was operating around 250 robotaxis and roughly 190 robotrucks as of the end of 2024, according to Shi.

            "article_content": "The retail industry is witnessing a paradigm shift, thanks to the transformative power of machine learning. A recent article by Akhilesh Kota sheds light on how machine learning is revolutionizing the dynamic pricing landscape, enabling retailers to make more informed and adaptive decisions. The insights delve into the nuances of this innovative approach, emphasizing its role in reshaping consumer experiences and business profitability.\n\nUnderstanding Dynamic Pricing\n\nDynamic pricing is a strategy that adjusts prices in real-time, responding to fluctuations in demand, competition, and external factors. Unlike traditional static pricing, it uses advanced algorithms to analyze and react to market conditions with accuracy and speed. When combined with machine learning, dynamic pricing becomes even more powerful. Machine learning algorithms process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and refine pricing strategies based on actionable insights. This enables businesses to stay competitive, meet customer expectations, and maximize revenue. By ensuring prices are neither excessively high nor unsustainably low, dynamic pricing balances profitability with customer satisfaction, driving sustainable business growth.\n\nMachine Learning: The Game Changer\n\nThe application of machine learning in dynamic pricing brings unprecedented sophistication to pricing strategies, leveraging data-driven insights to enhance decision-making. Machine learning algorithms excel in several key areas:\n\nAnalyzing Market Trends: These systems detect subtle shifts in consumer preferences, competitor pricing, and market conditions, enabling proactive and informed pricing adjustments.\n\nPredicting Demand: By forecasting demand patterns for specific products and timeframes, businesses can optimize inventory levels, avoid stockouts, and maximize revenue opportunities.\n\nEnhancing Personalization: Tailored pricing strategies based on individual customer profiles, preferences, and purchase history create a more personalized and engaging shopping experience.\n\nBy automating complex analytical processes, machine learning not only reduces human error but also enables faster, more accurate responses to dynamic market conditions, empowering businesses to stay competitive.\n\nData as the Backbone\n\nThe success of machine learning in dynamic pricing hinges on the quality and diversity of data inputs. Retailers need to collect extensive information, such as historical sales trends, customer demographics, competitor pricing, and broader economic indicators. These datasets are essential for training algorithms that evolve and optimize pricing strategies over time. Furthermore, integrating real-time data allows these models to adapt swiftly to changing market conditions, ensuring prices remain competitive and aligned with current demand. This combination of comprehensive data and real-time updates empowers businesses to make informed, agile decisions, helping them gain an edge in today\u2019s fast-paced and competitive markets.\n\nOvercoming Challenges\n\nThe potential of machine learning in dynamic pricing is vast, but it comes with challenges that businesses must navigate carefully. Ethical concerns, such as unintentional price discrimination, can erode consumer trust if not addressed transparently. Moreover, the implementation of machine learning systems demands substantial investment in infrastructure, skilled professionals, and technical expertise. These hurdles can be daunting, particularly for smaller organizations. To overcome them, businesses should prioritize transparency in pricing strategies and ensure algorithms adhere to ethical standards. Investing in scalable, user-friendly technologies and fostering a workforce skilled in data science can simplify adoption, ensuring the benefits outweigh the challenges.\n\nFuture Prospects\n\nThe integration of machine learning into dynamic pricing represents a transformative shift toward a smarter and more adaptive retail landscape. As technology continues to advance, several key developments are expected to shape the future of pricing strategies:\n\nImproved Algorithms: Enhanced models will delve deeper into consumer behavior, identifying subtle trends and preferences for precise price adjustments.\n\nSeamless Integration: Dynamic pricing systems will increasingly connect with inventory management, marketing, and customer engagement tools, creating unified ecosystems.\n\nGlobal Applications: Machine learning will enable region-specific pricing strategies, catering to the unique demands of diverse markets and cultural contexts.\n\nThese advancements will not only empower retailers with better decision-making tools but also foster customer satisfaction by ensuring transparent, fair, and competitive pricing tailored to individual needs.\n\nIn conclusion, Akhilesh Kota\u2019s insights into machine learning-powered dynamic pricing reveal its immense potential to transform retail. Leveraging data and advanced algorithms enables businesses to enhance efficiency, boost profitability, and adapt to evolving market demands. Embracing these innovations will be essential for retailers aiming to thrive in a competitive and rapidly changing industry landscape."

Image: Adobe Stock\n\nWhile the definitive diagnosis of iRBD requires in-laboratory video polysomnography, which can be both costly and challenging to interpret, a recent study used a 3D time-of-flight camera in a sleep laboratory with high accuracy, the researchers wrote.\n\nIn this study, During and colleagues sought to replicate and expand on those results utilizing a conventional 2D camera to monitor patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep difficulties and create a machine-learning analysis method, to replicate prior research attempted with a 3D lens in track sleep-related movements.\n\nTheir study featured 172 participants \u2014 81 with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls \u2014 evaluated between 2016 and 2022 at Stanford Sleep Center. The control group included 28 healthy sleepers and 63 individuals with other sleep disorders, who were matched to iRBD patients by age and sex.\n\nAll video-EEG polysomnography recordings were made with a 2D camera, shooting at 30 frames per second and were manually scored by two blinded sleep experts. A blinded sleep specialist also reviewed all recordings of iRBD patients to determine which individuals had visible movements in REM sleep.\n\nThe researchers then used an optical flow computer vision algorithm to analyze these recordings and extract features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility.\n\nAfter review, it was determined that the control group was comprised of 28 healthy individuals and 63 with a sleep disorder. Within the iRBD group, 11 individuals did not have visible movements during REM sleep.\n\nAccording to results, individuals with iRBD demonstrated an increased amount of movements (56.3 vs. 41.8 per hour; average movement duration, 3.4 vs. 4.2 seconds) and immobility periods, compared with controls.\n\nThe accuracy for distinguishing iRBD from other sleep disorders ranged from 84.9% to 87.2%, with the highest accuracy (91.9%) achieved when combining all five movement features and analyzing only short movements. Of 11 patients with iRBD without visible movements during REM sleep, seven were correctly identified.\n\n\u201cThis automated approach could be integrated into clinical workflow during the interpretation of sleep tests to enhance and facilitate diagnosis, and avoid missed diagnoses,\u201d During said in a related Mount Sinai press release. \u201cThis method could also be used to inform treatment decisions based on the severity of movements displayed during the sleep tests and, ultimately, help doctors personalize care plans for individual patients.\u201d\n\nReference:"

By signing, the US joins 120 countries working together to protect students, teachers, and schools from violent attacks.\n\nAttacks on schools occur in almost every armed conflict around the world. Each year, thousands of students and teachers are killed and injured, schools destroyed, and children denied the future only education brings.\n\nBy signing the declaration, countries promise to investigate and prosecute attacks that violate the laws of war, help victims, try to continue education during wartime, restore access after attacks, and protect schools from military use.\n\nIn the decade since the declaration was first launched, more than a dozen countries have revised their military guidance to ensure more protection for schools and education. Several have prosecuted people responsible for attacking schools. UN peacekeepers have stopped deploying in schools.\n\nUS policy already supports the declaration\u2019s key elements \u2013 for example, the US military includes schools in its official \u201cno strike\u201d lists, recognizing that schools not being used for military purposes are protected civilian property under the laws of war.\n\nSigning the declaration puts the US on the right side of a global movement its main military allies have already joined. Given its influence, the US move could help expand the group of countries putting their political muscle behind children and their education, encouraging allies, such as Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea to join. Signing better allows the US to use the declaration\u2019s guidance, written by military officers, to urge other countries to respect the laws of war, including when it trains other militaries. Protecting schools globally also protects the US\u2019 significant investments in international education before, during, and after conflict.\n\nThe US signing of the declaration couldn\u2019t be more timely or relevant. In the past year, almost every school in Gaza has been damaged or destroyed. Since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, more than 3,790 educational facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Countries that have not yet endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration should move quickly to do so, and show that schools, teachers, and students are off-limits in times of war."

            "article_content": "The United States on Thursday announced sanctions against Sudan\u2019s army chief and leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, citing his role in prolonging the country\u2019s brutal civil war. The conflict, which began in April 2023, has claimed tens of thousands of lives and displaced millions.\n\nThe US Treasury Department accused Burhan of employing war tactics that include indiscriminate bombing of civilian infrastructure, attacks on schools, markets, and hospitals, and extrajudicial executions. These measures follow similar sanctions last week against Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, the leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n\nThe Treasury clarified that the sanctions, which freeze Burhan\u2019s US assets and restrict American dealings with him, are intended to demonstrate neutrality in the conflict. Additional sanctions were also imposed on a Sudanese-Ukrainian national and a Hong Kong-based company for allegedly supplying weapons to Sudan\u2019s army.\n\nWhile speaking on Al Jazeera, Burhan said, \u201cI hear there\u2019s going to be sanctions on the army leadership. We welcome any sanctions for serving this country.\u201d\n\nThe Sudanese army and the RSF initially cooperated in a 2021 coup that ousted Sudan\u2019s civilian leadership. However, tensions over plans to integrate their forces escalated into open conflict two years later.\n\nBoth factions have faced accusations of war crimes. The US previously determined that the RSF engaged in genocide and attacks on civilians, while the army has been accused of indiscriminate airstrikes, including recent revenge attacks in Wad Madani.\n\nThis week, the army captured the strategic city of Wad Madani and vowed to retake Khartoum, Sudan\u2019s capital. However, the ongoing violence has driven half of Sudan\u2019s population into hunger and devastated the nation.\n\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia have made repeated efforts to broker peace, including talks in Geneva, but progress has been limited. The army has consistently rejected negotiations, choosing instead to escalate military operations.\n\nIn his final press conference as Secretary of State, Antony Blinken expressed regret over the inability to end the conflict, highlighting ongoing human suffering. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep working here for the next three days, and I hope the next administration will take that on as well,\u201d Blinken said.\n\nSudan\u2019s foreign ministry criticised the US sanctions, accusing Washington of expressing \u201cnothing but confusion and a weak sense of justice,\u201d in defending RSF atrocities.\n\nAs the war rages on, the prospect for peace remains uncertain, with millions of civilians bearing the brunt of the devastating conflict.\n\nMelissa Enoch\n\nFollow us on:"

The benchmark index is tracking its best weekly advance since the November election as bond yields retreated.\n\nHartnett \u2014 who took a neutral tone on stocks last year \u2014 said if the peak in yields and \u201cTrump 2.0\u201d failed to lift small-cap stocks above a 2021 record high that would drive asset allocators to cut overweight positioning in stocks.\n\nHis team suggests being long on international stocks like Europe, China and emerging markets amid policy easing in those regions. He also recommends buying rate-sensitive stocks like homebuilders, utilities, financials and REITs as the 30-year Treasury yield has peaked below 5%.\n\nThe bank\u2019s monthly global fund manager survey \u2014 which polls investors on allocation and sentiment \u2014 is due on Tuesday.\n\n--With assistance from Jan-Patrick Barnert.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P."

            "article_content": "Senators on Thursday pressed some of President-elect Donald Trump's top Cabinet picks on his central campaign promises, critical natural disaster relief and more.\n\nInterior secretary nominee Doug Burgum, proposed Environmental Protection Agency director Lee Zeldin, Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent and Housing secretary nominee Scott Turner all went before lawmakers. After fiery faceoffs earlier in the week, they were asked in calmer hearings about the nation's economy and readiness for natural disasters.\n\nBessent would be Trump\u2019s point person on GOP priorities such as tax cuts and tariffs. Meanwhile, Burgum and Zeldin would both have sway over the Trump administration's energy policy, a cornerstone of the president-elect's reelection bid.\n\nHere are USA TODAY's top takeaways from the hearings.\n\nMore:Takeaways from Senate confirmation hearings: Democrats grill Trump Cabinet nominee\n\nBipartisan concerns about tariffs\n\nTrump often talks about implementing tariffs on foreign goods, deploying them during his first term and promising more in a second administration.\n\n\u201cThe word tariff, properly used, is a beautiful word - one of the most beautiful words I've ever heard,\u201d Trump told a crowd of Georgia supporters in September. \u201cIt's music to my ears.\u201d\n\nBessent, a prominent hedge fund manager, said Americans should think about tariffs in three ways under Trump: A negotiating tactic, a tool to remedy \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d and a way to raise revenue.\n\nBut some lawmakers are nervous about mores tariffs.\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told Bessent that tariffs on Canadian goods could strike the economy in his New England state.\n\n\u201cWhat reassurance can we get from the Trump administration that there\u2019s going to be a do-no-harm policy to American consumers and Vermont workers and small businesses with a tariff policy?\u201d Welch asked.\n\nBessent argued Trump is sensitive to the needs of \"working America,\" but he admitted to lawmakers it's \u201cvery difficult for me to isolate Vermont especially.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., raised concerns about the impact of tariffs on U.S. farmers\n\n\u201cOveruse of tariffs can inflate costs and provoke trade retaliation,\u201d Young told Bessent. \u201cAs Hoosier farmers have experienced first hand over the years, they often bare the impact.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s plans to impose massive tariffs and deport millions of immigrants who lack permanent legal status are likely to reignite inflation and dampen economic growth, according to forecasters.\n\nYet his pledge to extend and expand the sweeping tax cuts passed in his first term and ease the regulatory burden on businesses could juice the economy and have mixed effects on inflation.\n\nClimate questions\n\nTrump has promised to expand oil production in the U.S., and he'll lean on Burgum to help. The former North Dakota governor told senators he believes America has reached an energy crisis, but he also believes climate change exists.\n\nRepublicans like West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, who owns a coal mining business, told Burgum energy is \u201ca key that opens every door.\u201d\n\nDemocrats like Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, pointed to testimonies previously given by former Secretaries of Defense James Mattis and Chuck Hagel. They said climate change is a national security threat that affects areas where troops are stationed.\n\nMore:'When can he start?': Trump allies bullish on Cabinet nominees getting confirmed\n\n\u201cWithin fossil fuels, the concern has been about emissions, and within emissions, we have the technology to do things like carbon capture to eliminate harmful emission,\u201d Burgum said.\n\nMore:What is carbon capture and how does it work? Inside the process that could slow global warming\n\n\u201cYou have military leaders who acknowledge that climate change is a major issue,\" Hirono shot back. \"For you to take the position that you're going to engage in active actions that will result in the burden of burning more fossil fuel, it's troubling.\"\n\nZeldin was also questioned about climate change.\n\n\u201cDo you agree with President-elect Trump that climate change is a hoax?\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asked.\n\nZeldin replied that he believes climate change is real, before defending his potential future boss.\n\n\u201cAs far as President Trump goes, the context that I have heard him speak about it was with a criticism of policies that have been enacted because of climate change,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cAnd I think that he\u2019s concerned about the economic costs of some policies where there\u2019s a debate and a difference of opinion between parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would respectfully disagree with you,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWildfire control \u2018very key\u2019\n\nCalifornia wildfires have left 25 dead and thousands of schools, businesses and other structures destroyed in the Greater Los Angeles area. Lawmakers asked Trump's nominees about the blazes during Thursday's hearings.\n\nSens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., opened their remarks by addressing the fires. Lee directed Burgum that, if he's confirmed, addressing wildfires that shocked Western states should be a \"very key priority\" for the country's future.\n\nElsewhere, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questioned Zeldin on his willingness to advocate for Californians affected by the Los Angeles-area wildfires fires. Trump and certain House Republicans have signaled their interest in placing conditions on disaster aid for California, amid tense relations between the president-elect and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\u201cI assume, Mr. Zeldin, your response will not depend on whether disaster strikes a red state or a blue state, you will equally work to speed relief to those Americans affected?\u201d Schiff asked.\n\n\u201cYes, senator,\u201d Zeldin replied. The potential Trump pick vowed he would \"do everything in my power to be able to assist\" devastated communities.\n\nTax fight preview\n\nTrump\u2019s signature achievement during his first administration was a massive tax cut.\n\nSome of those tax cut provisions expire at the end of 2025. Trump wants to extend them and has promised new cuts, including ending taxes on tipped wages and Social Security payments.\n\nBessent said extending the Trump tax cuts is the single most important economic issue of the day.\n\n\u201cThis is pass- fail, that if we do not fix these tax cuts, if we do not renew and extend, then we will be facing an economic calamity,\u201d he said.\n\nBessent was also asked about everything from increasing the federal minimum wage to capping credit card interest rates and increasing economic sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBessent said he doesn\u2019t support increasing minimum wage nationally. He argued it's a step that should be taken by states instead.\n\nLater, he was open to increasing sanctions on Russia.\n\n\"If any officials in the Russian Federation are watching this confirmation hearing they should know that if I'm confirmed, and if President Trump requests as part of his strategy to end the Ukraine war, that I would be 100% on board for taking sanctions up,\" Bessent said.\n\nContributing: Paul Davidson"

Inadequate Authentication: Some networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks.\n\nSome networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks. Rogue Access Points (APs): Attackers can set up rogue APs mimicking legitimate Guest Wi-Fi to lure users and steal sensitive information.\n\nIf not properly secured, the Wi-Fi guest networks pose significant security risks. Weak access controls allow unauthorized users to exploit the network, leading to data interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. A critical issue is the lack of network segmentation; without proper isolation, attackers on the guest network may access internal systems, risking data breaches.\n\nInsufficient authentication and weak password practices further heighten vulnerabilities, enabling unauthorized access. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement VLANs, strict authentication, and active monitoring. A well-segmented guest network helps maintain security while offering convenient access to visitors.\n\nWhy is BYOD the most critical category to monitor?\n\nBYOD introduces a mix of unmanaged and potentially insecure devices into the network. These devices often lack corporate-level security controls and might already be compromised with malware, creating a direct entry point for attackers once connected to the network.\n\nIf the attacker has access to the network through a BYOD, sensitive corporate data accessed via BYOD devices may increase the likelihood of unintentional or malicious data leakage.\n\nHere is a summary of the potential actions that can be implemented to mitigate such issues :\n\nProper Network Segmentation\n\nAsset inventory\n\nEncryption\n\nAuthentication Mechanism (like Captive Portal)\n\nProfiled Security Policies\n\nMonitoring and Threat Detection\n\nZero Trust Approach\n\nPotential consequences for businesses\n\nSecurity breaches in guest Wi-Fi networks can have devastating impacts on organizations. Recent studies indicate that 40% of businesses have experienced information compromise through public Wi-Fi networks. The financial implications are significant, with some companies reporting ransomware payments exceeding $1 million to recover their data.\n\nBeyond immediate financial losses, businesses face:\n\nDamage to brand reputation and customer trust\n\nDisruption of normal business operations\n\nPotential loss of intellectual property\n\nCompromise of internal network resources\n\nLegal and compliance considerations\n\nOrganizations must navigate complex regulatory requirements when implementing guest Wi-Fi management systems. The legal framework includes multiple layers of compliance, they need to warrant the security level for their network while ensuring the confidentiality of the users' data, and they need to cooperate with the authorities when required while complying with limited data retention period obligation. It is even more difficult for international organizations because they need to monitor and stay updated on any regulations' changes in various countries and jurisdictions, operating at international levels creates diverse and even contradictory obligations, for example, the data retention policies are different among countries, in France, it is required to retain data logs for 1 year, but it is 6 years in Italy, while the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) requires users' data to be deleted after the purposes have been achieved. Some key regulations need to be taken into consideration:\n\nTherefore, businesses must implement proper documentation, monitoring systems, and security controls to maintain compliance with these regulations. Regular security audits and network infrastructure updates are essential to maintaining legal compliance while providing secure guest access.\n\nLeveraging Cloud Captive Portals for Enhanced Security\n\nCloud-based captive portal solutions have emerged as a cornerstone of modern network security infrastructure. These sophisticated systems provide organizations with centralized control over guest access while maintaining robust security protocols.\n\nHow Cloud Captive Portals Work\n\nCloud-captive portals function as gateway systems that authenticate users before granting network access. The system intercepts initial connection attempts and redirects users to a secure login page. Organizations can implement various authentication methods, including:\n\nSocial login integration\n\nSponsor\n\nDeclarative Email\n\nSMS Authentication\n\nThese solutions operate without additional hardware requirements, making them infrastructure-agnostic and instantly deployable across global locations.\n\nIntegration with Zero Trust frameworks\n\nModern Cloud Captive Portals should align seamlessly with Zero Trust security principles by implementing continuous verification and limited access protocols.\n\nThe integration enables:\n\nDevice Profiling & Authentication\n\nIntegrity\n\nAccess Control\n\nPolicy Enforcement\n\nAutomation\n\nTraffic Monitoring & Compliance\n\nRequired security features to deploy a cloud captive portals solution\n\nModern captive portal solutions shall incorporate multiple layers of security protection. Innovative solutions now integrate with leading security solutions, enabling administrators to implement granular access controls and URL filtering.\n\nCloudi-Fi platform supports comprehensive compliance requirements through regional data center deployment, ensuring adherence to local privacy regulations. Automated encryption of personal data and transparent collection processes provide users and administrators complete control over information handling.\n\nAdvanced features include integration with cloud-based security platforms, enabling:\n\nCloud firewall implementation\n\nContent filtering capabilities\n\nBandwidth Control\n\nAutomated device onboarding\n\nThese capabilities offer a robust security framework that protects both the organization's network and user data while maintaining seamless access for authorized users.\n\nBenefits of a Zero Trust Captive Portal Solution\n\nThe implementation of Zero Trust Architecture represents a paradigm shift in securing guest Wi-Fi networks, moving away from traditional perimeter-based security to a more comprehensive verification model. This approach fundamentally changes how organizations manage and secure guest network access.\n\nZero Trust Cloud Captive Portal solutions provide a scalable, centralized access control layer across multiple sites or large office campuses. By leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, they allow seamless deployment without needing extensive on-prem hardware, ensuring consistent policy enforcement and secure, device-specific access. The cloud-based platform dynamically scales to handle high volumes of traffic and multiple entry points, while continuously monitoring user behaviors. This architecture not only simplifies management but also enhances security, as threats are isolated, and access is tightly controlled based on identity, device, and risk assessment, all through a unified, cloud-driven approach.\n\nAdapting Zero Trust principles for guest access\n\nOrganizations must carefully adapt Zero Trust principles to maintain security while ensuring a seamless guest experience. The implementation requires a balanced approach that considers security requirements and user convenience. Key adaptation strategies include:\n\nRole-based permissions for the access control\n\nSponsoring, social login with MFA, mail address, \u2026 for user authentication\n\nSegmentation for network isolation\n\nTime-limited access tokens for session management\n\nBenefits of traditional security models\n\nZero Trust Architecture offers significant advantages compared to conventional security approaches. The model eliminates the inherent vulnerabilities of traditional perimeter-based security by implementing continuous verification and granular access controls.\n\nThe transformation from traditional to zero-trust security brings multiple operational improvements:\n\nEnhanced Security Posture Elimination of lateral movement threats\n\nReal-time threat detection and response\n\nComprehensive audit trails Operational Efficiency Automated device onboarding\n\nCentralized policy management\n\nSimplified compliance reporting\n\nThe architecture's ability to maintain strict security controls while supporting dynamic access requirements makes it particularly effective for guest Wi-Fi environments. By implementing least-privilege access principles, organizations can ensure that guests receive only the necessary network resources while maintaining complete visibility and control over all network activities.\n\nIntegrating Zero Trust principles with cloud-based management platforms enables distributed organizations to effortlessly scale their guest Wi-Fi security efficiently. This combination offers network and security administrators powerful tools for monitoring network usage, enforcing security policies, and responding to potential threats in real time.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe transformation of guest Wi-Fi security through cloud-captive portals and Zero Trust Architecture marks a significant advancement in corporate network protection. Modern organizations require robust security solutions that extend beyond traditional perimeter defenses. The combination of continuous verification, granular access controls, and advanced monitoring capabilities creates a comprehensive security framework that addresses current and emerging threats while maintaining operational efficiency.\n\nBusiness leaders must recognize the critical role of secure guest Wi-Fi in maintaining regulatory compliance and protecting sensitive data. Organizations ready to strengthen their network security should consider implementing a Zero Trust Captive Portal solution - Cloudi-Fi offers extensive resources and guidance for this essential security upgrade. This strategic approach positions businesses to meet future security challenges while providing secure, seamless guest access that supports operational goals and protects valuable digital assets.\n\nNote: This article is expertly written and contributed by RJ Singh, Chief Revenue Officer at Cloudi-Fi, with extensive experience in sales leadership and business development, and Simon Mesnage, Senior Network Engineer with 8 years of expertise in Wi-Fi infrastructure design and troubleshooting."

They built custom generative AI applications on their cloud provider using OpenAI\u2019s APIs for broader analysis, providing access to their LLMs (large language models) and ChatGPT to get more strategic and valuable answers to their business questions. The process was costly and complex, and it delivered suboptimal results. That all changed when they adopted federated learning.\n\nThe strategy of federation in AI deployments\n\nFederated learning is emerging as a game-changing approach for enterprises looking to leverage the power of LLMs while maintaining data privacy and security. Rather than moving sensitive data to LLM providers or building isolated small language models (SLMs), federated learning enables organizations to train LLMs using their private data where it resides. Everyone who worries about moving private enterprise data to a public space, such as uploading it to an LLM, can continue to have \u201cprivate data.\u201d Private data may exist on a public cloud provider or in your data center.\n\nThe real power of federation comes from the tight integration between private enterprise data and sophisticated LLM capabilities. This integration allows companies to leverage their proprietary information and broader knowledge in models like GPT-4 or Google Gemini without compromising security. More importantly, it means not having to deal with moving petabytes of data to a public cloud that\u2019s also hosting an LLM."

(Photo Credits: Instagram)\n\nAfter an eight-year break from acting, Cameron Diaz is returning to the big screen with the Netflix comedy Back in Action, also starring Jamie Foxx. During the film\u2019s promotion, Diaz left Foxx speechless when she cracked a joke about Donald Trump and Elon Musk. She mocked Musk\u2019s recent role in Trump\u2019s administration, as the tech billionaire was appointed to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nPromoting the movie, when Foxx asked Diaz her favourite conspiracy theory, she shared her thoughts on aliens and the possibility of humans living on Mars and humorously suggested that Musk might be the real president of the USA.\n\nrelated stories\n\nSpeaking on Complex, Diaz shared her thoughts about how aliens are imagined with big heads, large eyes, no mouths and long fingers. She explained this idea claiming that it connects to how humans interact through screens without actually speaking, almost like telepathy. According to her, \u201cAll of the science in the space station and we learn about how the body atrophies in space because there\u2019s no gravity and all the changes that happen on the cellular level.\"\n\n\u201cWe all know that we\u2019re moving off the planet because now Elon Musk is our president, we\u2019re going to end up at Mars and when we get to Mars like we\u2019re really going to end up being completely different species. We will have all the technology that the aliens have that are visiting us here on the planet and those aliens will be us, travelling back in time to study who they were at this particular moment,\" Cameron Diaz explained. Diaz\u2019s conspiracy theory left Jamie Foxx shocked.\n\nJamie Foxx mentioned the Illuminati, saying that either you believe in it or you don\u2019t, but he personally doesn\u2019t. Foxx joked that the Illuminati was just a group of regular people like us and wondered why, if they are supposed to be in control, he still faces issues, like getting stopped by the police. He humorously suggested that if the Illuminati is real, they should step in and help him during such difficult situations.\n\nBack in Action marks Cameron Diaz\u2019s return after her 2014 appearance in the Annie remake, where she starred alongside Jamie Foxx. The two actors had also worked together in the 1999 film Any Given Sunday. Their upcoming movie is scheduled to premiere on Netflix on January 17.\n\nFirst Published: January 17, 2025, 16:54 IST"

            "article_content": "When we think of artificial intelligence (AI), data science and the potential real-world impact of these rapidly developing fields, we tend to look to the future\u2014particularly when it comes to health.\n\nIn life sciences, AI is already having a significant impact on our ability to bring new medicines to patients, from accelerating drug discovery to supporting the early detection of disease, improving clinical research and shaping our understanding of complex biology.\n\nAt AstraZeneca, an early adopter of AI and data science for healthcare, these tools are helping scientists in their quest to find life-changing new treatments for some of the world's most challenging diseases, in order to transform patient outcomes.\n\nJim Weatherall is the Chief Data Scientist, Biopharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca. For the past five years, working closely with partners across the organization, he has played a key role in integrating data science and AI into drug discovery and development\u2014from answering specific scientific questions to improving the ways of working for chemists, biologists, and clinicians who are striving to solve them.\n\n\"Biology is still an unsolved problem,\" Weatherall says, \"It's characterized by a lot of uncertainty and a lot of variety\u2014variety between individuals, between cells in the body, variety between what the proteins in those cells do and how they talk to each other.\n\n\"There's still so much we don't understand. However, the good news is that we have extensive historical data from experiments and clinical trials. We're also continuously generating new data, more than ever before, and can use AI to turn it into value for patients at unprecedented speed and scale, in order to deliver much needed biomedical insights.\"\n\nOne of the key ways in which AI has transformed AstraZeneca's research is in the discovery and design of drugs. Historically, medicines have been discovered and designed manually by scientists in the laboratory\u2014this needs to be rigorous and deliberate, but can often be a slow and painstaking process, contributing to the lengthy development process of new medicines.\n\nNow, AstraZeneca chemists are armed with AI tools inspired by \"reinforcement learning.\" This technique is, in part, inspired and borrowed from its success in other tasks\u2014such as applications where computers can exceed human levels of performance in winning at games such as chess and Go.\n\n\"In reinforcement learning, you're asking AI to maximize a score, to find as many different outcomes as possible and choose the best one\u2014which is something that can be applied just as well to the design of a molecule that might one day become a new medicine,\" Weatherall explains.\n\nIt means that instead of synthesizing hundreds of molecules by hand, machine learning tools can quickly sift through thousands of possibilities, highlighting the most promising candidates for further study.\n\nIt also allows researchers to take a more \"zoomed-out perspective,\" Weatherall says, \"to help us make better scientific decisions, so that we can have a higher probability of success, and the potential for medicines to reach patients faster.\"\n\nGoing forward, AstraZeneca researchers are applying that same approach to different classes of medicines, such as antibodies, which are often used to treat diseases."

            "article_content": "\u201cL\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi\u201d is a phrase attributed to French king Louis XIV, the Sun King, though it is considered by historians to be apocryphal: meaning \u201cI am the state,\u201d it speaks to the king\u2019s absolute and divinely ordained power. Three kings ruled from the Palace of Versailles: Louis XIV until his death in 1715, then Louis XV from 1722 until 1774 and finally, Louis XVI until the Revolution of 1789. Louis XV was among the best-educated royals of his age, and his knowledge was of a mostly scientific nature. From the age of seven, he was passionate about cartography, and at age eleven, he discovered astronomy. \u201cIn addition to his core education, he touched upon anatomy and surgery, and from medicine, he went on to study botany. He read a great deal, assiduously consulted the maps in his geography gallery, attended dissections, studied plants at Trianon [a smaller building at Versailles] and observed the heavens, following every astronomical event,\u201d writes French art historian Beatrix Saule in the book that accompanies the London Science Museum\u2019s exhibition, \u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour.\u201d While Versailles and its kings have always been regarded as sumptuous and somewhat decadent against a backdrop of the then-starving French peasantry, the scientific pursuits of the kings are not at the top of public consciousness. Until, that is, this show was put together.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

I was surprised, therefore, that the revolution was mentioned only briefly in this exhibition: while it is written on plaques that scientific instruments were destroyed or stolen during the riots, it is not explained at length, nor is it explained fully as to whether the republic that followed adopted the scientific discoveries of their forebears. This, I feel, is a glaring omission, and one that will leave visitors wanting to know more: while the exhibition book mentions that \u201cdocuments and scientific instruments were scattered at the time of the revolutionary sales in 1793-94, when Versailles was emptied of all its furnishings\u201d and that objects were taken to various institutions, it does not feel thorough. True, the exhibition is entitled \u201cVersailles\u201d rather than \u201cFrance: Science and Splendour,\u201d but more background wouldn\u2019t be out of place.\n\nThe star of the show is Louis XV\u2019s rhino. The male Indian rhinoceros presented to Louis XV in 1769 by Jean-Baptiste Chevalier de Conan, the governor of Chandernagore (now Chandannagar) in Bengal, has pride of place in the exhibition\u2019s main room. The plaque reads that he was killed during the revolution, possibly drowning in the fountains or after being stabbed with a sword. While he lived, the rhinoceros was among thousands of animals from Europe, Asia, Africa and America in the royal menagerie. They were a source of inspiration for many artists, such as the Flemish animal painter Pieter Boel, whose studies included a painting of one of the rarest birds in the menagerie, the cassowary, sent to Versailles in 1671 from Madagascar.\n\nThe other star of the show is the Clock of the Creation of the World (the Pendule de la Cr\u00e9ation du monde). At the time of its manufacture\u20141754\u2014clocks were considered to be the most sophisticated and most prestigious devices ever made. Its design and mechanisms are a spectacle to behold: at the top, a shining sun banishes the darkness, which is represented in the form of clouds. It really is marvelous to look at: like jewelry, it gleams brilliantly in the light, and the meteorological forms are very stunningly depicted. \u201cIn the lower part, held in a patinated bronze rock surrounded by raging waves, sits a terrestrial globe engraved with the different countries. This globe rotates on its axis in 24 hours, and the inclination of the poles varies according to the seasons. A long ray of sun indicates midday in the countries situated on the same latitude,\u201d the exhibition book explains further.\n\nA portrait of Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet (1706\u20131749) is also included in the exhibition\u2014she who was deemed by her lover Voltaire to be \u201ca great man whose only fault was being a woman.\u201d While living with and supporting the writer financially, she accumulated a very large library, carried out scientific experiments and wrote a great number of books. One of the first to appear, in 1738, was El\u00e9mens de la philosophie de Neuton (translated colloquially, A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Newtonianism), which was thought to be by Voltaire but was, in fact, a collaborative effort. In addition to her literal translation of Newton\u2019s prose, du Ch\u00e2telet provided more accessible explanations of his arguments with clear examples: \u201cShe transformed his geometrical expositions into modern calculus, and also summarised the latest mathematical research and experimental vindications of his theories,\u201d says Versailles: Science and Splendour. I would have liked to have some space dedicated to the position of women in France at the time. Of the scientific community, how many were women? What level of education could a middle- or working-class woman attain? Sadly, this wider context is missing.\n\nThe construction of the magnificent fountains at Versailles, which still function gloriously today, is given space. The plans for the mechanisms and piping that would deliver the requisite 9,500 cubic meters of water , composed by \u201csavants and engineers,\u201d along with the taxidermied rhinoceros and the Clock of the Creation of the World, really give the exhibition its splendor. That said, if I had the chance to curate such a show, I would dedicate one of the galleries to a reproduction of a palace room of Versailles, complete with paneled walls, gilding and paintings. The objects in the exhibition, though fascinating, are rendered a little clinical in their austere Science Museum settings. Nevertheless, the show is a tremendous feat and sure to spark curiosity in those who make the time to visit.\n\n\u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour\u201d is at London\u2019s Science Museum through April 21, 2025."
