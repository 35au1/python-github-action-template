Known as lenticular clouds, these strange phenomena are created when strong winds blow over a mountain range or hill, forming a wave shape that causes air to bounce downwind. These spectacular clouds form on top of the bounced air and appear to be stacked on top of each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoreditch skyline transformed by 50ft hologram displaying stunning visuals\n\nLenticular clouds are also known as UFO clouds or pancakes\n\nThey are not often seen in the UK and typically form to the side of mountains, with Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges often displaying them. The Met Office explained: \u201cThese lens-shaped orographic wave clouds form when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.\u201d They are said to be the most pronounced during either sunrise or sunset due to the low sun illuminating them. They are known to pose aviation hazards.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The national meteorological service added that skilled or brave glider pilots often prefer flying with these types of clouds in the sky as \u201cthey can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising\u201d. Lenticular clouds were visible on Thursday and Friday mornings in North-east England.\n\nTrending"

The 44th annual United Food Operation food drive kicked off Friday. It\u2019s a 12 week effort to collect as much non-perishable food as possible to be passed along to the region\u2019s needy.\n\n\u201cWe do our pre-planning and get everything together and as we\u2019re talking to the pantries, they\u2019re running out of food. The need is so great we\u2019ve got to keep this going,\u201d said Elaine Harris, UFO Chairperson.\n\nEach Friday through April, the organization will accept donations of food at their warehouse in Institute to be distributed to a dozen food banks across two counties.\n\n\u201cOur warehouse is right off the Institute exit, there will be a big sign. We can take food and store it there and then distribute to the food banks,\u201d she explained.\n\nThis year the American Postal Workers Union Local 133 has joined the effort. The union members are employed at the U.S. Postal Service Processing Center at Southridge. The facility had originally been slated for closure, but thanks to efforts by the community and West Virginia\u2019s Congressional delegation it was saved and will stay in place. Harris said the organization wanted to get involved in the food drive out of gratitude.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their way of giving back to the community because the community was so very involved and supportive of them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur members are very excited to take part in this,\u201d Tim Holstein, Vice President of APWU Local 133, said in a news release. \u201cWe have a table set up in front of the union office at the plant and at the Main Post Office and are asking everyone to bring canned/nonperishable food to donate. One can of food could make a difference in someone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nThe effort accepts any non-perishable goods. They\u2019ll take them at the warehouse each Friday or they can also make arrangements to pick up large donations. Harris said it\u2019s a never ending labor of love.\n\n\u201cThe need is so great. This is working people falling through the cracks. This is how we started this program almost 45 years ago,\u201d she said."

More info\n\nLanarkshire has been named a UFO sighting hotspot by a group of researchers who recorded ten incidents over two years.\n\nAreas such as Hamilton, East Kilbride, Airdrie, Uddingston, and Cumbernauld were all witnesses to mysterious objects, which varied from cylindrical to star-like.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023, reports Lanarkshire Live. And from January 2021 to December 2023, the group logged ten sightings across Lanarkshire.\n\nThis included a cylindrical-shaped object flying with no vapour trail above Airdrie, an orange light that \u201cappeared to be making a tear in the sky\u201d in Uddingston and \u201cthree saucer shaped objects appearing stationary\u201d over Hamilton.\n\nSome sightings across the region happened on consecutive days, in different areas. A sphere was spotted over Cumbernauld on April 21, 2021, while a similar-shaped object was clocked the following day over Hamilton \u201cmoving oddly and hovering in the sky\u201d.\n\nAn orb was viewed above Cumbernauld on August 24, 2021, and appeared to be \u201cmoving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times\u201d, and the following day three objects were seen \u201cmoving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds\u201d above East Kilbride.\n\nThey are among 395 sightings across the United Kingdom \u2013 and an updated map reveals the extent of the unexplained activity taking place in the skies above us.\n\nUFOs have been in the news recently following a spate of sightings on the east coast of the United States. And last year the US Congress attempted to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u2018Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u2019 heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts.\n\nUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold \u2013 former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team \u2013 told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d.\n\nHowever, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US assets and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d\n\nHe insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies.\n\nWhile the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be.\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings in the UK (48 per cent) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25 per cent) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17 per cent), \u201csphere\u201d, (10 per cent) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (nine per cent).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings. That was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34).\n\nWhen it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters \u2013 which possibly explains the high sightings in nearby Lanarkshire.\n\nJoin Glasgow Live's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nSIGHTINGS ACROSS LANARKSHIRE\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 21/04/2021\n\nDescription: Object moving north to east and then changed back to a northerly direction then disappeared.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 22/04/2021\n\nDescription: Reflective ball-object moving oddly and hovering in the sky.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 16/05/2021\n\nDescription: Two lights travelling parallel at slow speed, before fading away behind a cloud.\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Orb\n\nDate spotted: 24/08/2021\n\nDescription: Light changed from white to red, moving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 25/08/2021\n\nDescription: Three objects moving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 27/09/2021\n\nDescription: Triangular beam of light like a search light moving at a steady rate, brighter at the top.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Disc\n\nDate spotted: 28/12/2021\n\nDescription: Three saucer shaped objects appearing stationary, in photograph, not seen with naked eye.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 11/02/2022\n\nDescription: Three stars in a straight line formation, moving very fast from west to east then fading from view.\n\nAirdrie\n\nShape of UFO: Cylinder\n\nDate spotted: 27/06/2022\n\nDescription: Object \u2018like a plane with no wings\u2019 flying high up with no vapour trail.\n\nUddingston\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 17/11/2023\n\nDescription: Orange light appeared to be making a tear in the sky.

            "article_content": "Microsoft made a trio of announcements this week that are going to be very important for how the company approaches its big AI bet in 2025. It started off by creating a new AI engineering group to focus its developers on building an AI platform and tools for both Microsoft and its customers. Microsoft then announced pay-as-you-go agents for its relaunched Copilot Chat for businesses, and it finished the week by bundling Office AI features into Microsoft 365 for consumers and raising the subscription price.\n\nAll three of these announcements are linked to Microsoft\u2019s insatiable hunger to win at AI. The company still prioritizes security through employee performance reviews, but it increasingly feels like promoting AI is an equally high priority.\n\nThe new engineering group is a good example of Microsoft\u2019s priorities. Led by former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, the new CoreAI \u2013 Platform and Tools division will combine Microsoft\u2019s Dev Div and AI platform teams together. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described the reorganization as \u201centering the next innings of this AI platform shift\u201d and said it will \u201creshape all application categories.\u201d Nadella has regularly said that the pace of AI is changing software development, and now Microsoft is building an AI-first app stack to try and take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nCombining Microsoft\u2019s AI platform work and its developer division will put AI at the heart of the very tools, platforms, and services that Microsoft builds for customers and its own teams. Nadella even described this platform shift as the ability for Microsoft\u2019s AI agents, which are essentially virtual employees that automate tasks, to eventually be able to build custom applications. It\u2019s a transformation for Microsoft that looks like it will flip the company from software-as-a-service to service-as-software \u2014 where once-manual human tasks are automated by software and AI.\n\nMicrosoft has spent the past 15 years selling cloud computing to businesses, tempting them to move off traditional software that\u2019s licensed and installed to on-premise servers toward servers hosted by the software giant. Nadella led Microsoft\u2019s transformation to cloud infrastructure and services before becoming CEO, and it\u2019s been hugely successful for the company. Now, Nadella appears to be betting on being able to automate many people-based services and package this up in a software solution Microsoft can sell to businesses.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to some employees in Microsoft\u2019s Dev Div organization this week, and it\u2019s clear there is some unease about the company\u2019s commitment to AI at all costs. Microsoft\u2019s new AI engineering group emerged just days after Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg predicted 2025 is going to be a year where \u201cMeta, and the other companies that are working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a mid-level engineer that you have at your company that can write code.\u201d In an interview with Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg said he believes that, over time, a lot of the code in Meta\u2019s apps \u201cwill be built by AI engineers instead of people engineers.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a scary prospect for the thousands of engineers at Meta and Microsoft who have spent their entire careers learning how to build software. One engineer in Microsoft\u2019s new CoreAI team tells me there\u2019s now a feeling that if you\u2019re not all in on AI, there won\u2019t be a place for you in this new team.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s transition here will undoubtedly see engineering jobs change, and it\u2019s all part of a revenue opportunity for AI that the company is constantly chasing. Investors are increasingly looking for returns on Microsoft\u2019s big bets on AI, and recent reports have suggested that it\u2019s struggling to sell businesses on the idea of paying extra for AI-powered versions of Office apps. That\u2019s probably why this week we also saw Microsoft relaunch Copilot as Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, complete with free ChatGPT-like capabilities and pay-as-you-go agents. It\u2019s a rebranding of what was once Bing Enterprise Chat, then Copilot, and now Copilot Chat.\n\nI spoke to Jared Spataro, Microsoft\u2019s chief marketing officer of AI at work, earlier this week, and he made it clear this relaunch is also Microsoft\u2019s latest attempt to get people hooked on using AI at work. \u201cWhat we find is that when you start to use it, you become accustomed to and appreciative of the value that it can provide at work,\u201d says Spataro.\n\nThe free chat side of Copilot has already been popular for businesses that rely on Microsoft\u2019s software and services, and by adding in agent capabilities, there\u2019s an upsell opportunity to get businesses to pay extra to automate tasks with AI.\n\nMicrosoft can also use this Copilot Chat as a way to tempt businesses into upgrading to the full Microsoft 365 Copilot at $30 per user per month. \u201cWhile Copilot Chat is a powerful new on-ramp for everyone in your organization to build the AI habit, Microsoft 365 Copilot remains our best-in-class personal AI assistant for work,\u201d says Spataro.\n\nThis is where Copilot really transforms from a simple chatbot into a more assistive technology that can analyze Excel data for you, write paragraphs in Word, or generate an entire PowerPoint presentation. A lot of CTOs tell me that businesses have found the most value from Copilot inside Microsoft Teams, where the AI assistant will transcribe meetings and pull out key talking points to make it easy to catch up on calls you might have missed.\n\nMost businesses aren\u2019t paying the extra for Copilot inside Office apps, though. While adding an AI-powered version of the Python programming language to Excel is powerful and summaries of Outlook emails are super useful, Microsoft needs a lot more compelling Copilot features if it wants businesses to pay that $30 per user per month fee.\n\nIt\u2019s a similar situation over on the consumer side, which is why Microsoft started bundling its AI-powered Office features into Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions this week. Instead of asking consumers for $20 extra per month for Copilot Pro, Microsoft is raising its subscription prices by $3 per month to bundle Copilot into Office apps.\n\nAs part of this price bump, Microsoft is providing a set of AI credits that can be used on Copilot in apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. You\u2019ll get a monthly allotment of these credits, which can also be used for things like image generation in the Designer app or in apps on Windows like Paint, Photos, and Notepad. If you want unlimited usage of Copilot in Office apps or all of these AI features, you\u2019ll still need to pay for Copilot Pro.\n\nMicrosoft had been testing this Microsoft 365 subscription change in Australia, New Zealand, and some markets in Asia, and it feels like the worldwide launch this week is an even bigger test before the company does something similar for its commercial subscriptions.\n\nGoogle may well force Microsoft\u2019s hand here, after revealing this week that its Gemini Business plan, which you previously had to pay $20 per user per month for, is now free. Google is now bringing all of its AI features to its Workspace app at no extra cost, which piles on the pressure for Microsoft to make some similar moves for commercial customers of Microsoft 365.\n\nAs the competition heats up in 2025, expect to see Microsoft come up with even more inventive pay-as-you-go agents or AI credit methods to get consumers and businesses addicted to AI.\n\nThe pad:\n\nMicrosoft won\u2019t support Office apps on Windows 10 after October 14th. If you\u2019re still on Windows 10, it\u2019s getting closer to the point of upgrade time. Microsoft has started warning that it will no longer support Office apps, known as Microsoft 365 apps, on Windows 10 after October 14th \u2014 the day support ends for the old OS. While the apps will continue to function, there could be issues over time. It\u2019s all part of an effort from Microsoft to get businesses and consumers to upgrade to Windows 11.\n\nIf you\u2019re still on Windows 10, it\u2019s getting closer to the point of upgrade time.

Microsoft stops using Bing to trick people into thinking they\u2019re on Google. Microsoft has started quietly killing off its spoofed Google UI that it was using to trick Bing users into thinking they were using Google. The page that appeared after you searched for \u201cGoogle\u201d on Bing no longer has a special search bar or an image that resembles a Google Doodle. It\u2019s just a regular Bing search result now, although some countries still have the fake Google UI.\n\nMicrosoft has started quietly killing off its spoofed Google UI that it was using to trick Bing users into thinking they were using Google.

Parallels has launched an \u201cearly technology preview\u201d that lets Apple silicon Macs emulate Intel-based hardware to run Windows. Performance will be \u201creally slow\u201d right now, though, with boot times of up to seven minutes.

Panay left Microsoft in 2023, after working alongside Groene to create the original Surface tablet more than 10 years ago. Amazon also hired Xbox cofounder J Allard recently, who is also working on Panay\u2019s devices team.

Microsoft files a gaming AI patent for \u201ccrafting and altering game narratives.\u201d I\u2019m still waiting for Microsoft to unveil its AI plans for Xbox, but it looks like the company is already exploring ways that AI can be used in game design. Windows Central has spotted a patent from 2024 that allows designers and players to customize a game through generative AI prompts. Nvidia has been showing off similar work for NPCs in games, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we start to see a lot more of this.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting for Microsoft to unveil its AI plans for Xbox, but it looks like the company is already exploring ways that AI can be used in game design.

There aren\u2019t many Microsoft employees who can say they\u2019ve been at the company 40 years, but Larry Osterman is one of them. To celebrate Osterman\u2019s long tenure \u2014 that has included work on Windows, Exchange, and Azure \u2014 Microsoft gifted him a giant 40th-anniversary crystal. It took almost six months to be delivered, and it looks like it was worth the wait.

According to OpenAI, researchers used the model\u2019s suggestions to change two of the Yamanaka factors to be more than 50 times as effective\u2014at least according to some preliminary measures.\n\n\u201cJust across the board, the proteins seem better than what the scientists were able to produce by themselves,\u201d says John Hallman, an OpenAI researcher.\n\nHallman and OpenAI\u2019s Aaron Jaech, as well as Rico Meinl from Retro, were the model\u2019s lead developers.\n\nOutside scientists won\u2019t be able to tell if the results are real until they\u2019re published, something the companies say they are planning. Nor is the model available for wider use\u2014it\u2019s still a bespoke demonstration, not an official product launch.\n\n\u201cThis project is meant to show that we\u2019re serious about contributing to science,\u201d says Jaech. \u201cBut whether those capabilities will come out to the world as a separate model or whether they\u2019ll be rolled into our mainline reasoning models\u2014that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d\n\nThe model does not work the same way as Google\u2019s AlphaFold, which predicts what shape proteins will take. Since the Yamanaka factors are unusually floppy and unstructured proteins, OpenAI said, they called for a different approach, which its large language models were suited to.\n\nThe model was trained on examples of protein sequences from many species, as well as information on which proteins tend to interact with one another. While that\u2019s a lot of data, it\u2019s just a fraction of what OpenAI\u2019s flagship chatbots were trained on, making GPT-4b an example of a \u201csmall language model\u201d that works with a focused data set.\n\nOnce Retro scientists were given the model, they tried to steer it to suggest possible redesigns of the Yamanaka proteins. The prompting tactic used is similar to the \u201cfew-shot\u201d method, in which a user queries a chatbot by providing a series of examples with answers, followed by an example for the bot to respond to."

            "article_content": "A staple in Minnesota\u2019s science innovation and education has hit a major milestone. The Bakken Museum in Minneapolis is celebrating 50 years of bringing electricity and scientific education to life.\n\nThe museum has become a hub for scientific research, exhibition and archiving, including a rare book and instrument collection, as well as exhibits about electricity, architecture and more.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s just a profound love of learning and exploring and discovery at this organization,\u201d the museum\u2019s vice president of programs Anika Taylor said. \u201cI absolutely adore opportunities to work with visitors who are here exploring something and to see them make a connection or make a discovery, or have a moment of sort of lighting up.\u201d\n\nEarl Bakken, famous for co-founding Medtronic and creating the first external wearable battery-powered pacemaker, founded the museum in 1975 in hopes of becoming a research center focused on \u201cElectricity in Life.\u201d It now also includes exhibits about plants, medicine and even Mary Shelley and her book \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d a special inspiration of Bakken\u2019s.\n\nTurn Up Your Support MPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding. Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all.\n\nAs a child, Bakken spent his time building and taking apart different electronic devices. When he saw the movie version of \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d he knew he wanted to pursue a career in electrical engineering, which he studied at the University of Minnesota.\n\nTaylor says the Mary Shelley exhibit is truly a favorite.\n\n\u201cI just love it, because there are so many fun stories and ideas that connect to this exhibit, the story of who Mary Shelley was and what led her to write that story, the notion that this is sort of our first example of science fiction, and that science fiction has, in turn, also inspired science and inspires the public to consider the science that we do in different ways because we can explore it in fictional realms.\u201d\n\nThe Bakken Museum. pictured on Sept. 18, 2020, is located on the West shore of Bde Maka Ska in Minneapolis. Found by Earl Bakken in 1975, it is features interactive exhibits for all ages and STEM education programs. Courtesy of the Bakken Museum\n\nInterim Vice President of Advancement Stu Silberman says what makes the Bakken special is how it \u201cinvests in the future of the state of Minnesota while leveraging its wonderfully historic past.\u201d A past that started before the museum became a nonprofit and was established at its current location on Bde Maka Ska in 1975. Before that, Bakken had been collecting artifacts and literature at his company\u2019s headquarters.\n\nThe Bakken is a popular field trip destination with hands-on opportunities like the shock circle that plays with static electricity that sticks students\u2019 hair on its ends or the Bakkenspiel, an interactive musical workshop. Heather Walch, a board member, loves seeing students light up.\n\n\u201cMy absolute favorite part is the kids that are visiting the Bakken when they learn something new, and they don\u2019t really realize they\u2019re learning anything because it\u2019s fun and it's just filled with giggles,\u201d Walch said.\n\nThrough its STEM education program, the Bakken Museum has begun taking educational programs on the road to sites and schools across the state where educators spend a week with students.\n\nTaylor hopes the museum continues to change its \u201chidden gem\u201d persona.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s coming to visit our museum or whether it\u2019s bringing us out to whatever corner of the state folks are in, we\u2019d love to get as many people involved in celebrating this 50th year,\u201d she said.\n\nThe museum will be hosting events throughout the year to mark its milestone birthday, including a party in October and family discovery day events throughout the year, as well as their \u201cBakkenalia\u201d 21+ events."

            "article_content": "We\u2019ve been waiting for a big ChatGPT upgrade for months now, but OpenAI has yet to announce one. Sure, the company had a monster month of announcements in December. OpenAI took the o1 reasoning model out of beta, making it available to more ChatGPT users. The text-to-video Sora tool is now available to users in certain markets. The o3 reasoning model has also been announced and is currently undergoing testing.\n\nThese are just a few of the AI announcements OpenAI made in December, but there\u2019s no word on when the GPT-4o upgrade will drop. Unofficially, reports say that ChatGPT GPT-5, or whatever it ends up being called, is running behind schedule, as OpenAI has had issues training the next-gen AI model. OpenAI isn\u2019t the only AI company experiencing such problems.\n\nSam Altman has been hyping OpenAI\u2019s accomplishments recently, teasing potential ChatGPT features to come in 2025 while also talking about the larger goals. AGI (artificial general intelligence) is the next big thing, an AI that can tackle any task just like a human would. After AGI, we get to artificial superintelligence (ASI), which is AI that exceeds the capabilities of the human mind.\n\n\u201cWe are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it,\u201d Altman said in a blog post recently, adding that OpenAI is already starting to look at superintelligence development.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nHow close are we to that big AI breakthrough? Some people think the recent excitement that some OpenAI engineers are displaying online suggests that the company is indeed close to some sort of big advancement in AI.\n\nSome AI fans noticed the recent teasers from OpenAI employees, as well as an essay from an AI researcher who goes by the name of \u201cGwern\u201d online.\n\n\ud83d\udea8 AI Researcher Gwern just dropped the latest essay on OpenAI o3, o4, o5\n\n\n\nHere are a few important points from the essay:\n\n\n\n\u2013 openAI may have chosen to keep its \"o1-pro\" model private, using its computational resources to train a more advanced model like \"o3\", similar to the\u2026 https://t.co/p10BXXjuQH pic.twitter.com/Zcu7a1uY7C \u2014 Haider. (@slow_developer) January 16, 2025\n\nGwern theorized that OpenAI may hold the key to developing AGI and superintelligence. A powerful reasoning model like the o1 or o1 pro can produce the data needed to train more advanced reasoning models.\n\nThe essay author in the tweet above also said they\u2019re surprised OpenAI isn\u2019t keeping o1-pro private so they can use it for training o3 and newer models. Eventually, AI models will train themselves, leading to the big AGI and ASI breakthroughs we\u2019re waiting for.\n\nGwern suggests that OpenAI may already be on the verge of a big breakthrough, or they\u2019ve already done it behind closed doors:\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why OAers are suddenly weirdly, almost euphorically, optimistic on Twitter, watching the improvement from the original 4o model to o3 (and wherever it is now!) may be why. It\u2019s like watching the AlphaGo Elo curves: it just keeps going up\u2026 and up\u2026 and up\u2026 There may be a sense that they\u2019ve \u2018broken out\u2019 and have finally crossed the last threshold of criticality, from merely cutting-edge Al work, which everyone else will replicate in a few years, to takeoff \u2013 cracked intelligence to the point of being recursively self-improving and where o4 or o5 will be able to automate AI R&D and finish off the rest.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about OpenAI being close to the next massive improvement in AI but also the future beyond that. Access to superintelligence will make subsequent AI developments easier and more efficient because an AI mind will handle the next innovations.\n\nAlso, in a scenario where OpenAI might be close to AGI and ASI, it would obtain an incredible advantage over competitors. Other AI firms that have not established their own superintelligence will have to develop AI with traditional methods. In contrast, OpenAI would have ASI employing its own discoveries to create better AI, and it\u2019ll do it more efficiently.\n\nThis is all speculation at this point, as OpenAI has yet to make any announcements. But it\u2019s all based on the recent hype from Sam Altman and other OpenAI engineers. Of course, they always seem to go out of their way to hype OpenAI\u2019s efforts on social media, so this all could simply be more of the same.\n\nAlso, if and when ChatGPT AGI and ASI are reached, don\u2019t expect it to be affordable or even available publicly. At least, not initially. OpenAI rivals might be just as close to AGI and ASI, but they might be more restrained in teasing imminent breakthroughs.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s also the safety aspect to consider. Artificial intelligence, from the current ChatGPT models to AGI and ASI, will have to be aligned with humanity\u2019s interests so it doesn\u2019t develop its own agenda, which could almost certainly endanger our species.\n\nBack to GPT-5, it\u2019ll still be interesting to see what OpenAI does next in terms of ChatGPT upgrades. More news about o3 should come soon. Then, GPT-4o will celebrate its first anniversary this summer. Some sort of upgrade for the base ChatGPT model is surely due soon."

These arrangements generally involve sales agents, recruiters, or marketers who direct patients to purported telemedicine companies, which then enter into payment arrangements with physicians and/or non-physician practitioners for the provision of medically unnecessary health care services. The practitioners often have limited or no interaction with the supposed patients, do not review or have access to patient medical records, and order or prescribe medically unnecessary items or services from a predetermined list.\n\nIn July 2022, the OIG formalized its concerns regarding such arrangements in a Special Fraud Alert. As noted by the OIG, these schemes implicate multiple civil and criminal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, the civil False Claims Act (FCA), and criminal fraud statutes. The OIG further stated that these arrangements have the potential for considerable harm to both federal health care programs and program beneficiaries, including (1) inappropriate increases in costs for medically unnecessary items and services, (2) patient harm or delayed clinical services, and (3) corruption of medical decision-making.\n\nWhile DOJ and the OIG have continued to pursue and investigate telefraud schemes, two cases announced in 2024 demonstrate a shift in telemedicine enforcement from \u201ctraditional\u201d schemes to more sophisticated investigations and potential criminal exposure in certain matters.\n\nFirst, in June 2024, Ruthie He, the founder, CEO, and clinical president of Done Global (Done), and David Brody, clinical president of Done and the sole physician shareholder of Done Health, P.C., were indicted, arrested, and arraigned in a first-of-its-kind telemedicine criminal prosecution (see our prior post here). Both He and Brody face a seven-count indictment alleging conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, aiding and abetting the distribution of controlled substances, conspiracy to commit health care fraud, and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nThe indictment alleges that He and Brody orchestrated a scheme to generate over $100 million in revenue by inappropriately offering Adderall and other stimulants for the treatment of attention deficit disorder. Among other allegations, the defendants purportedly violated the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine and directed practitioners to prescribe and renew Adderall prescriptions without clinical justification. The practitioners were allegedly paid based upon an above-market pay structure tied to the number of patients ultimately receiving prescriptions. Indeed, the indictment asserts that prescribing practitioners often were not licensed in the states where prescriptions were issued and that Adderall and other stimulants were ordered in violation of state physician supervision requirements.\n\nThe prosecution of He and Brody is proceeding in federal court in the Northern District of California before Judge Breyer. In October 2024, He\u2019s bond was revoked, and she was remanded to custody as a flight risk. On December 2, 2024, He filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, moved to compel disclosure of grand jury materials. The motion asserts that the indictment fails to satisfy the knowledge requirement under the Controlled Substances Act, that the health care fraud conspiracy elements have not been adequately alleged, and, in the alternative, that He should be entitled to grand jury materials. On December 16, 2024, DOJ opposed the motion to dismiss, arguing the sufficiency of the indictment and contesting the disclosure of grand jury materials. The motion to dismiss is currently pending.\n\nIn addition to He and Brody, several other Done personnel have cases pending in the Northern District of California. Two Done nurse practitioners and an executive leader have cases pending before Judge Breyer. In the last related case, a Done physician has entered a plea agreement.\n\nSecond, also in June 2024, a behavioral health telemedicine holding company and its practice affiliates (collectively, Supportive Care) agreed to pay approximately $4.6 million to resolve allegations related to the submission of false claims to Medicare and the Connecticut Medicaid program. Interestingly, DOJ alleged that the telemedicine company submitted false claims for \u201ctelehealth originating site facility fees.\u201d Under the applicable Medicare billing code, telehealth originating site fees are only billable when the originating site (in this case the nursing facility) provides administrative and clinical support for the telehealth patient. Instead, here, the telemedicine company and its affiliates billed for the originating site facility code.\n\nAdditionally, DOJ alleged that Supportive Care submitted false claims for psychological services for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries residing in nursing facilities. DOJ alleged, however, that the beneficiaries were not in fact residing in the nursing facilities and had been transferred to various hospitals and admitted as inpatients. The settlement resolved both sets of FCA allegations.\n\nThese two cases demonstrate that DOJ and the OIG are expanding their investigation and enforcement activities beyond \u201ctraditional\u201d telefraud arrangements into more complex areas. In the Done prosecution, DOJ is seeking to criminally enforce allegedly fraudulent telehealth activity implicating compliance with state corporate practice and physician supervision requirements. In the Supportive Care resolution, DOJ and the OIG focused on the alleged failure to adhere to telehealth-specific codes. Both matters portend a trend likely to continue in 2025 whereby a maturing telehealth industry is subject to more sophisticated government investigations.\n\n[View source.]"

According to OpenAI, researchers used the model\u2019s suggestions to change two of the Yamanaka factors to be more than 50 times as effective\u2014at least according to some preliminary measures.\n\n\u201cJust across the board, the proteins seem better than what the scientists were able to produce by themselves,\u201d says John Hallman, an OpenAI researcher.\n\nHallman and OpenAI\u2019s Aaron Jaech, as well as Rico Meinl from Retro, were the model\u2019s lead developers.\n\nOutside scientists won\u2019t be able to tell if the results are real until they\u2019re published, something the companies say they are planning. Nor is the model available for wider use\u2014it\u2019s still a bespoke demonstration, not an official product launch.\n\n\u201cThis project is meant to show that we\u2019re serious about contributing to science,\u201d says Jaech. \u201cBut whether those capabilities will come out to the world as a separate model or whether they\u2019ll be rolled into our mainline reasoning models\u2014that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d\n\nThe model does not work the same way as Google\u2019s AlphaFold, which predicts what shape proteins will take. Since the Yamanaka factors are unusually floppy and unstructured proteins, OpenAI said, they called for a different approach, which its large language models were suited to.\n\nThe model was trained on examples of protein sequences from many species, as well as information on which proteins tend to interact with one another. While that\u2019s a lot of data, it\u2019s just a fraction of what OpenAI\u2019s flagship chatbots were trained on, making GPT-4b an example of a \u201csmall language model\u201d that works with a focused data set.\n\nOnce Retro scientists were given the model, they tried to steer it to suggest possible redesigns of the Yamanaka proteins. The prompting tactic used is similar to the \u201cfew-shot\u201d method, in which a user queries a chatbot by providing a series of examples with answers, followed by an example for the bot to respond to."

            "article_content": "Medical Properties Trust (MPW 2.25%) got off to a challenging start last year. In January, the real estate investment trust (REIT) revealed that its top tenant at the time, Steward Health Care, was experiencing liquidity issues, which impacted its ability to pay rent.\n\nSteward filed for bankruptcy a few months later. The year ended more positively as the REIT was able to take control of its real estate from Steward and lease most of those properties to five higher-quality replacement operators.\n\nWith Steward no longer in the picture, the healthcare REIT thought it had finally closed the door on its tenant issues last year. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. It recently revealed that another leading tenant, Prospect Medical Group, has filed for bankruptcy.\n\nNew year, same issue\n\nProspect Medical Group filed for bankruptcy in early January. The healthcare company has been experiencing liquidity issues, due partly to the stalled sales processes across several East Coast markets (Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania). The REIT has investments linked to Prospect in two of those states (Connecticut and Pennsylvania). It also has investments in California.\n\nMedical Properties Trust had previously recapitalized its $1.6 billion investment with Prospect in May 2023, which included:\n\nCalifornia : The REIT had a $513 million investment in six leased California hospitals. Prospect was to resume making partial rent payments on these properties in September of that year and full payments in March of 2024.\n\nConnecticut : Medical Properties Trust has a $457 million real estate investment that it agreed to sell as part of Yale New Haven Health's acquisition of Prospect's operations in the state. The REIT expected to recoup its investment via that sale (which still hasn't closed) and the sale of its interest in Prospect's managed-care business (valued at $103 million).\n\nPennsylvania : The REIT transferred its Pennsylvania real estate to Prospect in exchange for a $150 million mortgage loan and $100 million of equity in Prospect's managed-care business.\n\nOther : The REIT had another $264 million of loans, $56 million of accrued rent and interest, and a $50 million convertible loan to the managed-care business, all of which it expected to recover through the sale of Prospect's managed-care business.\n\nAs a result of its liquidity issues, Prospect hasn't paid any rent to Medical Properties Trust on the California hospital since last June, even though those facilities reported volume growth and improved coverage trends last year. Meanwhile, it has only made minimal payments related to leases and mortgages in Connecticut and Pennsylvania over the past two years.\n\nWorking to preserve and recover value\n\nMedical Properties Trust received some positive news regarding its investment in Prospect late last year. The company announced that Astrana Health had agreed to buy a majority of Prospect's managed-care platform for $745 million plus the assumption of some liabilities in November. As a result, Medical Properties Trust expects to receive about $200 million, with most of that cash expected in the first half of this year (it will also receive a $50 million payment by 2027).\n\nHowever, with Prospect filing for bankruptcy, the REIT's focus is now on protecting its California hospital investment. Medical Properties Trust also anticipates that the process will enable Prospect to successfully complete the sale of its Connecticut facilities. This outcome would enable it to recoup some of the value of its Connecticut properties while resuming rent collection in California.\n\nGiven that the REIT currently isn't collecting any income from these properties right now, the bankruptcy likely won't have any impact on its dividend (which currently yields 7.7%). Instead, its rental income is on track to rise this year as the new tenants at its former Steward facilities start making rental payments.\n\nThose payments will steadily escalate over the next two years, reaching their fully stabilized rate at the end of 2026 (about 95% of Steward's lease rate). That growing income stream could enable Medical Properties Trust to rebuild its dividend following two deep cuts in recent years.\n\nTwo steps forward and another back\n\nMedical Properties Trust continues to battle tenant-related headwinds. While it has finally severed its relationship with Steward, Prospect has become a source of trouble again.\n\nHowever, its bankruptcy could enable Prospect to finally sell off its troubled East Coast operations so that it can focus on California, which would benefit Medical Properties Trust. The hope is that it will quickly reemerge from bankruptcy, which could finally enable Medical Properties Trust to put its tenant issues in the past. That would allow the company to focus on rebuilding its portfolio, dividend, and shareholder value."

            "article_content": "The retail industry is witnessing a paradigm shift, thanks to the transformative power of machine learning. A recent article by Akhilesh Kota sheds light on how machine learning is revolutionizing the dynamic pricing landscape, enabling retailers to make more informed and adaptive decisions. The insights delve into the nuances of this innovative approach, emphasizing its role in reshaping consumer experiences and business profitability.\n\nUnderstanding Dynamic Pricing\n\nDynamic pricing is a strategy that adjusts prices in real-time, responding to fluctuations in demand, competition, and external factors. Unlike traditional static pricing, it uses advanced algorithms to analyze and react to market conditions with accuracy and speed. When combined with machine learning, dynamic pricing becomes even more powerful. Machine learning algorithms process vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and refine pricing strategies based on actionable insights. This enables businesses to stay competitive, meet customer expectations, and maximize revenue. By ensuring prices are neither excessively high nor unsustainably low, dynamic pricing balances profitability with customer satisfaction, driving sustainable business growth.\n\nMachine Learning: The Game Changer\n\nThe application of machine learning in dynamic pricing brings unprecedented sophistication to pricing strategies, leveraging data-driven insights to enhance decision-making. Machine learning algorithms excel in several key areas:\n\nAnalyzing Market Trends: These systems detect subtle shifts in consumer preferences, competitor pricing, and market conditions, enabling proactive and informed pricing adjustments.\n\nPredicting Demand: By forecasting demand patterns for specific products and timeframes, businesses can optimize inventory levels, avoid stockouts, and maximize revenue opportunities.\n\nEnhancing Personalization: Tailored pricing strategies based on individual customer profiles, preferences, and purchase history create a more personalized and engaging shopping experience.\n\nBy automating complex analytical processes, machine learning not only reduces human error but also enables faster, more accurate responses to dynamic market conditions, empowering businesses to stay competitive.\n\nData as the Backbone\n\nThe success of machine learning in dynamic pricing hinges on the quality and diversity of data inputs. Retailers need to collect extensive information, such as historical sales trends, customer demographics, competitor pricing, and broader economic indicators. These datasets are essential for training algorithms that evolve and optimize pricing strategies over time. Furthermore, integrating real-time data allows these models to adapt swiftly to changing market conditions, ensuring prices remain competitive and aligned with current demand. This combination of comprehensive data and real-time updates empowers businesses to make informed, agile decisions, helping them gain an edge in today\u2019s fast-paced and competitive markets.\n\nOvercoming Challenges\n\nThe potential of machine learning in dynamic pricing is vast, but it comes with challenges that businesses must navigate carefully. Ethical concerns, such as unintentional price discrimination, can erode consumer trust if not addressed transparently. Moreover, the implementation of machine learning systems demands substantial investment in infrastructure, skilled professionals, and technical expertise. These hurdles can be daunting, particularly for smaller organizations. To overcome them, businesses should prioritize transparency in pricing strategies and ensure algorithms adhere to ethical standards. Investing in scalable, user-friendly technologies and fostering a workforce skilled in data science can simplify adoption, ensuring the benefits outweigh the challenges.\n\nFuture Prospects\n\nThe integration of machine learning into dynamic pricing represents a transformative shift toward a smarter and more adaptive retail landscape. As technology continues to advance, several key developments are expected to shape the future of pricing strategies:\n\nImproved Algorithms: Enhanced models will delve deeper into consumer behavior, identifying subtle trends and preferences for precise price adjustments.\n\nSeamless Integration: Dynamic pricing systems will increasingly connect with inventory management, marketing, and customer engagement tools, creating unified ecosystems.\n\nGlobal Applications: Machine learning will enable region-specific pricing strategies, catering to the unique demands of diverse markets and cultural contexts.\n\nThese advancements will not only empower retailers with better decision-making tools but also foster customer satisfaction by ensuring transparent, fair, and competitive pricing tailored to individual needs.\n\nIn conclusion, Akhilesh Kota\u2019s insights into machine learning-powered dynamic pricing reveal its immense potential to transform retail. Leveraging data and advanced algorithms enables businesses to enhance efficiency, boost profitability, and adapt to evolving market demands. Embracing these innovations will be essential for retailers aiming to thrive in a competitive and rapidly changing industry landscape."

In the film, Israelis described what it was like to experience the deadliest day for Jews since World War II as the Oct. 7 attacks unfolded, with around 1,200 people killed, 5,000 injured and 251 taken hostage. And in Gaza, where more than 40,000 people have reportedly been killed in Israel\u2019s retaliation against Hamas, Palestinians described \u2014 and recorded \u2014 the horrors of large-scale devastation.\n\nAs outrage over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza deeply divided American campuses and in some places devolved into hate-filled rhetoric and arrests, this June 2024 documentary with Retro Report investigated how universities responded, how powerful interests joined the fray, and how the conflict over the conflict ultimately spiraled out of control.\n\nThis documentary, updated in May 2024, offered a sweeping examination of the critical moments over the course of the past three decades leading up to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the role of a central player: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nIn this January 2024 documentary, correspondent Ramita Navai investigated rising support for militant groups, including Hamas, since the Oct. 7 attack, Israel\u2019s military campaign in the West Bank, and the implications for a region on edge.\n\nThis December 2023 documentary with The Washington Post examined how Hamas was able to breach Israel\u2019s vaunted security barrier and carry out the attack that ignited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nRe-released in October 2023, this seminal 2002 documentary examined how the Israeli-Palestinian peace process begun at Oslo in the 1990s was derailed and ultimately undone by the dynamics of politics and violence. The documentary included interviews with key figures from both sides of the negotiating table, including Benjamin Netanyahu, Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres, Saeb Erekat and Ehud Barak.\n\nExplore more from FRONTLINE on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."

            "article_content": "Recent data breaches have highlighted the critical need to improve guest Wi-Fi infrastructure security in modern business environments. Organizations face increasing pressure to protect their networks while providing convenient access to visitors, contractors, temporary staff, and employees with BYOD. Implementing secure guest Wi-Fi infrastructure has become essential for authenticating access, protecting data, maintaining compliance across all geographies, and ensuring business continuity.\n\nEvolved security solutions now combine zero-trust architecture with cloud-based captive portals to enhance network protection. These systems enable organizations to implement strict access controls, verify every device's security status, and maintain network separation. Through advanced features like conditional access and device registration, businesses can now offer secure guest Wi-Fi access while maintaining complete visibility and control over their network resources.\n\nChallenges in Wi-Fi Security Today\n\nDistributed organizations implementing guest Wi-Fi networks face increasingly sophisticated security challenges. The complexity of implementing and managing secure guest Wi-Fi access while maintaining network integrity has become a critical concern for both IT administrators and Security practitioners.\n\nCommon security vulnerabilities\n\nModern guest Wi-Fi networks face several significant security threats:\n\nLack of Network Micro-Segmentation: Networks for unmanaged/unsecured devices often share the same infrastructure as networks for managed/corporate devices without proper isolation. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.\n\nNetworks for unmanaged/unsecured devices often share the same infrastructure as networks for managed/corporate devices without proper isolation. This increases the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data. Weak Encryption: Most of Guest Wi-Fi Networks use \"Open\" authentication which may introduce a source of attack during spoofing. It's recommended to use WPA3 and OWE encryption to enforce the security for clients during association.\n\nMost of Guest Wi-Fi Networks use \"Open\" authentication which may introduce a source of attack during spoofing. It's recommended to use WPA3 and OWE encryption to enforce the security for clients during association. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Attackers can exploit unsecured Guest Wi-Fi to intercept communications, steal credentials, or inject malicious data.\n\nAttackers can exploit unsecured Guest Wi-Fi to intercept communications, steal credentials, or inject malicious data. Inadequate Authentication: Some networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks.\n\nSome networks use too simple shared passwords or no authentication at all, making it extremely easy for attackers to connect and launch attacks. Rogue Access Points (APs): Attackers can set up rogue APs mimicking legitimate Guest Wi-Fi to lure users and steal sensitive information.\n\nIf not properly secured, the Wi-Fi guest networks pose significant security risks. Weak access controls allow unauthorized users to exploit the network, leading to data interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. A critical issue is the lack of network segmentation; without proper isolation, attackers on the guest network may access internal systems, risking data breaches.\n\nInsufficient authentication and weak password practices further heighten vulnerabilities, enabling unauthorized access. To mitigate these risks, organizations should implement VLANs, strict authentication, and active monitoring. A well-segmented guest network helps maintain security while offering convenient access to visitors.\n\nWhy is BYOD the most critical category to monitor?\n\nBYOD introduces a mix of unmanaged and potentially insecure devices into the network. These devices often lack corporate-level security controls and might already be compromised with malware, creating a direct entry point for attackers once connected to the network.\n\nIf the attacker has access to the network through a BYOD, sensitive corporate data accessed via BYOD devices may increase the likelihood of unintentional or malicious data leakage.\n\nHere is a summary of the potential actions that can be implemented to mitigate such issues :\n\nProper Network Segmentation\n\nAsset inventory\n\nEncryption\n\nAuthentication Mechanism (like Captive Portal)\n\nProfiled Security Policies\n\nMonitoring and Threat Detection\n\nZero Trust Approach\n\nPotential consequences for businesses\n\nSecurity breaches in guest Wi-Fi networks can have devastating impacts on organizations. Recent studies indicate that 40% of businesses have experienced information compromise through public Wi-Fi networks. The financial implications are significant, with some companies reporting ransomware payments exceeding $1 million to recover their data.\n\nBeyond immediate financial losses, businesses face:\n\nDamage to brand reputation and customer trust\n\nDisruption of normal business operations\n\nPotential loss of intellectual property\n\nCompromise of internal network resources\n\nLegal and compliance considerations\n\nOrganizations must navigate complex regulatory requirements when implementing guest Wi-Fi management systems. The legal framework includes multiple layers of compliance, they need to warrant the security level for their network while ensuring the confidentiality of the users' data, and they need to cooperate with the authorities when required while complying with limited data retention period obligation. It is even more difficult for international organizations because they need to monitor and stay updated on any regulations' changes in various countries and jurisdictions, operating at international levels creates diverse and even contradictory obligations, for example, the data retention policies are different among countries, in France, it is required to retain data logs for 1 year, but it is 6 years in Italy, while the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) requires users' data to be deleted after the purposes have been achieved. Some key regulations need to be taken into consideration:\n\nTherefore, businesses must implement proper documentation, monitoring systems, and security controls to maintain compliance with these regulations. Regular security audits and network infrastructure updates are essential to maintaining legal compliance while providing secure guest access.\n\nLeveraging Cloud Captive Portals for Enhanced Security\n\nCloud-based captive portal solutions have emerged as a cornerstone of modern network security infrastructure. These sophisticated systems provide organizations with centralized control over guest access while maintaining robust security protocols.\n\nHow Cloud Captive Portals Work\n\nCloud-captive portals function as gateway systems that authenticate users before granting network access. The system intercepts initial connection attempts and redirects users to a secure login page. Organizations can implement various authentication methods, including:\n\nSocial login integration\n\nSponsor\n\nDeclarative Email\n\nSMS Authentication\n\nThese solutions operate without additional hardware requirements, making them infrastructure-agnostic and instantly deployable across global locations.\n\nIntegration with Zero Trust frameworks\n\nModern Cloud Captive Portals should align seamlessly with Zero Trust security principles by implementing continuous verification and limited access protocols.\n\nThe integration enables:\n\nDevice Profiling & Authentication\n\nIntegrity\n\nAccess Control\n\nPolicy Enforcement\n\nAutomation\n\nTraffic Monitoring & Compliance\n\nRequired security features to deploy a cloud captive portals solution\n\nModern captive portal solutions shall incorporate multiple layers of security protection. Innovative solutions now integrate with leading security solutions, enabling administrators to implement granular access controls and URL filtering.\n\nCloudi-Fi platform supports comprehensive compliance requirements through regional data center deployment, ensuring adherence to local privacy regulations. Automated encryption of personal data and transparent collection processes provide users and administrators complete control over information handling.\n\nAdvanced features include integration with cloud-based security platforms, enabling:\n\nCloud firewall implementation\n\nContent filtering capabilities\n\nBandwidth Control\n\nAutomated device onboarding\n\nThese capabilities offer a robust security framework that protects both the organization's network and user data while maintaining seamless access for authorized users.\n\nBenefits of a Zero Trust Captive Portal Solution\n\nThe implementation of Zero Trust Architecture represents a paradigm shift in securing guest Wi-Fi networks, moving away from traditional perimeter-based security to a more comprehensive verification model. This approach fundamentally changes how organizations manage and secure guest network access.\n\nZero Trust Cloud Captive Portal solutions provide a scalable, centralized access control layer across multiple sites or large office campuses. By leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, they allow seamless deployment without needing extensive on-prem hardware, ensuring consistent policy enforcement and secure, device-specific access. The cloud-based platform dynamically scales to handle high volumes of traffic and multiple entry points, while continuously monitoring user behaviors. This architecture not only simplifies management but also enhances security, as threats are isolated, and access is tightly controlled based on identity, device, and risk assessment, all through a unified, cloud-driven approach.\n\nAdapting Zero Trust principles for guest access\n\nOrganizations must carefully adapt Zero Trust principles to maintain security while ensuring a seamless guest experience. The implementation requires a balanced approach that considers security requirements and user convenience. Key adaptation strategies include:\n\nRole-based permissions for the access control\n\nSponsoring, social login with MFA, mail address, \u2026 for user authentication\n\nSegmentation for network isolation\n\nTime-limited access tokens for session management\n\nBenefits of traditional security models\n\nZero Trust Architecture offers significant advantages compared to conventional security approaches. The model eliminates the inherent vulnerabilities of traditional perimeter-based security by implementing continuous verification and granular access controls.\n\nThe transformation from traditional to zero-trust security brings multiple operational improvements:\n\nEnhanced Security Posture Elimination of lateral movement threats\n\nReal-time threat detection and response\n\nComprehensive audit trails Operational Efficiency Automated device onboarding\n\nCentralized policy management\n\nSimplified compliance reporting\n\nThe architecture's ability to maintain strict security controls while supporting dynamic access requirements makes it particularly effective for guest Wi-Fi environments. By implementing least-privilege access principles, organizations can ensure that guests receive only the necessary network resources while maintaining complete visibility and control over all network activities.\n\nIntegrating Zero Trust principles with cloud-based management platforms enables distributed organizations to effortlessly scale their guest Wi-Fi security efficiently. This combination offers network and security administrators powerful tools for monitoring network usage, enforcing security policies, and responding to potential threats in real time.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe transformation of guest Wi-Fi security through cloud-captive portals and Zero Trust Architecture marks a significant advancement in corporate network protection. Modern organizations require robust security solutions that extend beyond traditional perimeter defenses. The combination of continuous verification, granular access controls, and advanced monitoring capabilities creates a comprehensive security framework that addresses current and emerging threats while maintaining operational efficiency.\n\nBusiness leaders must recognize the critical role of secure guest Wi-Fi in maintaining regulatory compliance and protecting sensitive data.

They built custom generative AI applications on their cloud provider using OpenAI\u2019s APIs for broader analysis, providing access to their LLMs (large language models) and ChatGPT to get more strategic and valuable answers to their business questions. The process was costly and complex, and it delivered suboptimal results. That all changed when they adopted federated learning.\n\nThe strategy of federation in AI deployments\n\nFederated learning is emerging as a game-changing approach for enterprises looking to leverage the power of LLMs while maintaining data privacy and security. Rather than moving sensitive data to LLM providers or building isolated small language models (SLMs), federated learning enables organizations to train LLMs using their private data where it resides. Everyone who worries about moving private enterprise data to a public space, such as uploading it to an LLM, can continue to have \u201cprivate data.\u201d Private data may exist on a public cloud provider or in your data center.\n\nThe real power of federation comes from the tight integration between private enterprise data and sophisticated LLM capabilities. This integration allows companies to leverage their proprietary information and broader knowledge in models like GPT-4 or Google Gemini without compromising security. More importantly, it means not having to deal with moving petabytes of data to a public cloud that\u2019s also hosting an LLM."

            "article_content": "Astronaut James Irwin salutes in front of the landing module of the Apollo 15 on the moon in 1971.\n\nThe internet is absolutely full of myths and urban legends about space and just about everything else, so readers must be a skeptical these days.\n\nFrom claims of aliens crashing on Earth and UFOs being hidden on military bases, to Mars being abnormally large and the moon turning green, space tends to attract some outlandish or at least highly unproven claims that should be vetted carefully.\n\nHere are some of the biggest space myths and conspiracy theories that just won't go away.\n\n1. The Apollo moon landings were fake\n\nNASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin assemble the American flag on the moon during their Apollo 11 lunar landing mission in July 1969. NASA astronauts on the International Space Station marked the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch with a video message on July 16. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nTwelve NASA astronauts walked on the moon between 1969 and 1972, but in the decades since Apollo 11 astronauts first set foot on the moon, many theories have been put forward claiming that the whole Apollo program was staged. However, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has since released photos of the landing sites as they appear on the lunar surface many years later.\n\nSome of the questions moon landing deniers ask are \"Why are there no stars in the sky in the moonwalkers' photos? Why are the U.S. flags fluttering on the surface? Why do you see footprints in the pictures, but no marks from the lunar modules that landed there?\"\n\nIt turns out those questions are easy to answer than you may think.\n\nThere are no stars in the sky for the same reason you don't see stars during the day on Earth, according to NASA: The bright glow of daylight on the surface washes them out.\n\nU.S. flags planted into the lunar soil had metal rods sewn in them to appear as though they were moving, according to NASA. Without these wires, the flag would have hung straight down, making for a pretty lackluster photo prop.\n\nAnd the lunar modules, though heavier, didn't put prominent marks in the surface in some places because their mass was more evenly distributed than the astronauts' weight was in their boots.\n\n2. NASA is a lie\n\nNASA's Artemis 1 moon rocket arrives at Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building on Sept. 27, 2022. (Image credit: NASA's Kennedy Space Center)\n\nSome people actually believe NASA's whole function is not to explore space, but to generate space-related hoaxes. (The Apollo moon landing is a famous example that we'll explore in the next slide.) People who believe this conspiracy, sometimes flagged with the hashtag \"#NASAhoax\" on social media, will say that amazing space pictures of Mars, Pluto and even Earth are fake, computer-generated imagery (CGI).\n\nNASA was formed in 1958 \"to provide for research into problems of flight within and outside the Earth's atmosphere, and for other purposes,\" according to the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which then-president Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law shortly after the start of the space race against the Soviet Union.\n\nSince then, NASA has launched hundreds of satellites into orbit around Earth, the moon and several other worlds. In fact, NASA spacecraft have orbited, flown by or landed on every planet in the solar system. NASA also sends astronauts into orbit, where they conduct research at the International Space Station (ISS).\n\n\n\nIf you're not convinced, you are free to travel to Florida's Space Coast to watch a rocket launch for yourself. It's also quite easy to see the space station and other satellites with your own eyes with the help of a satellite tracker.\n\n3. The Earth is flat\n\nEarth as seen from space (Image credit: NASA)\n\nThis myth is so popular that there is even a group named after it: the Flat Earth Society. Members of the organization argue that the horizon is always at eye level, which they say would not be possible if the Earth were round. They also say there is no full movie of the Earth rotating from space \u2014 which is not true, as NASA has published multiple videos taken from satellites, including a live video of Earth from the ISS, which orbits our planet 16 times per day.\n\n\n\nOne way of demonstrating to yourself that the Earth is round is to consider how orbits of satellites work. Satellites constantly \"fall\" around the Earth as they are pulled around by our planet's gravity; they just need to be traveling fast enough at a high enough altitude to not slam into the atmosphere. Or, you can look at the amazing pictures taken by astronauts at the ISS.\n\n4. Planet Nine will kill us\n\nArtist's illustration of the hypothetical Planet Nine, which may lie undiscovered in the outer solar system. (Image credit: Caltech/R. Hurt (IPAC))\n\nIn April 2016, the New York Post tweeted, \"A newly discovered planet could destroy Earth as soon as this month.\" The newspaper was referring to Planet Nine, a theoretical planet at the edge of the solar system. An accompanying video also claimed that the new planet would be throwing all sorts of asteroids and comets at Earth, which would supposedly end up pummeling our planet.\n\n\n\nAlthough the existence of a ninth planet has not been confirmed, astronomers are actively looking for one to help explain motions of some objects in the icy Kuiper Belt, a vast region of icy objects beyond Neptune. If the planet is actually found, the planet will pose no threat to us, according to the California Institute of Technology's Mike Brown (who is one of the original backers of the Planet Nine theory).\n\n5. Alien research is happening at Area 51\n\nArea 51's restricted area covers over 90,000 acres (36,000 hectares) . (Image credit: Roger Holden via Getty Images)\n\nThe 1996 movie \"Independence Day\" is one of the main sources of the Area 51 hoax, which claims that aliens and their technology \u2014 recovered from crashed flying saucers \u2014 are being studied secretly at a classified military base about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of Las Vegas in the Nevada desert. Some people in the area around the base claim that they have seen strange lights or objects flying in or out of this area.\n\n\n\nWhile the testing and development conducted at Area 51 is classified, the U.S. government has acknowledged its existence (although the CIA officially calls it \"Homey Airport\" or \"Groom Lake\").\n\nA part of Edwards Air Force Base, the area was a known location for high-technology airplane flights in the 1960s and 1970s. It first served as a proving ground for Lockheed U-2 and A-12 OXCART spy planes as early as 1955. UFO sightings reported in the area were indeed unidentified objects, but only because the planes were top-secret \u2014 not because they were flown by aliens.\n\n6. There is a killer planet known as \"Nibiru\"\n\nArtist's conception of the fictional rogue planet Nibiru, or Planet X. Nibiru does not exist, so don't be fooled. (Image credit: gilderm | sxc.hu)\n\nConspiracy theorists say another dangerous planet is Nibiru, which was first mentioned in the 1976 book \"The Twelfth Planet,\" by Zecharia Sitchin. In the book, Sitchin translated ancient Sumerian cuneiform and claimed that the text is proof of a planet beyond Neptune called Nibiru that orbits the sun every 3,600 years.\n\n\n\nYears later, self-proclaimed psychic Nancy Lieder claimed to have communicated with extraterrestrials who said Nibiru would collide with Earth in 2003. When that didn't happen, the date was moved to 2012 (and linked, of course, with the 2012 doomsday predictions). Of course, the collision never occurred, the world didn't end in 2012 and no astronomer has ever found a planet on a collision course with Earth.\n\n7. There is a face on Mars\n\nThe original 'Face on Mars' image taken by NASA's Viking 1 orbiter, in grey scale, on July, 25 1976. Image shows a remnant massif located in the Cydonia region. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nIn 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft took a picture of what appeared to be a face on Mars. Immediately, some people said there must have been aliens on the Red Planet that left that face behind as evidence of their existence. NASA, however, pointed out that the suspected face is really just a pile of rocks casting shadows that resemble face-like features.\n\n\n\nNASA followed up with better-resolution pictures taken from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the Mars Global Surveyor in 1998 and 2001, respectively. These new images made it quite clear that the \"face on Mars\" is nothing more than a trick of light and shadows on a completely normal Martian mound.\n\n8. The moon Iapetus is an alien Death Star\n\nSaturn's moon Iapetus. (Image credit: NASA)\n\nIapetus is a moon of Saturn that looks somewhat like the infamous Death Star in the \"Star Wars\" franchise, with a large crater that resembles the fictional weapon's superlaser focus lens. The Death Star is a planet-killing machine that destroys entire worlds with its outrageously powerful laser. It was prominently featured in the 2016 movie \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,\" as well as in 1977's \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.\"\n\n\n\nA Daily Mail article published in May 2016 claimed Iapetus is an artificial object crafted by aliens. As \"evidence,\" the article cited a photo taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. In the photo, there's a line around the moon's equator that resembles the equatorial trench around the Death Star.\n\nBut this line isn't nearly as interesting as the Death Star's trench, which houses the battle station's engines, thrusters and docking bays. That line is nothing more than a mountain ridge, and Iapetus is actually just made up of boring old rock and ice. Cassini has flown by the moon to take pictures several times without being blasted by deadly alien lasers.\n\nSaturn's moon Mimas, with it's giant crater Herschel, also looks surprisingly like the Death Star.\n\n9. Saturn's hexagon is alien technology\n\nThis movie, made from images obtained by Cassini's imaging cameras, is the first to show Saturn's hexagon in color filters and the first movie to show a complete view from the north pole down to about 70 degrees north latitude. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SSI/Hampton University)\n\nSaturn's hexagon was first spotted when NASA's Voyager spacecraft flew by the giant, ringed planet in 1980. The bizarre, six-sided structure on the round planet's north pole caused quite the stir, because straight lines and polygons are not so common in nature.\n\n\n\nImmediately after the Voyager returned its first images of Saturn's strange feature, even stranger theories arose to explain it, including that it was somehow related to alien technology, or perhaps even was a gateway to hell. The hexagon is not artificial, but rather a weird-looking hurricane at Saturn's pole.\n\nNASA has done several flybys of this region with the Cassini spacecraft, studying the haze particles and other features of the storm, to try to learn more about its unusual properties.\n\n10. Mars is as big as the moon\n\nThe solar system to scale. The diameter of Jupiter (middle, with red spot) is about 11 times that of Earth (third planet from the left). Mars is the second-smallest planet in the solar system (fourth planet from left). (Image credit: Lunar and Planetary Institute)\n\nOriginating in 2003, the infamous Mars hoax asserts that Mars was closer to Earth than it had been in the 60,000 years prior, and that the planet will appear as large as the full moon. What started out as a misconstrued email turned into a recurring rumor that gets reshared every August and, naturally, has spread to social media as it became more popular.\n\n\n\nAlthough Mars is indeed relatively close to Earth in a cosmic sense, it will never be as large as the full moon. It will appear as a red dot in the sky, just as the ancient astronomers saw it. If you'd like to see Mars magnified, take out a telescope or look at one of NASA's spectacular Mars pictures."

Known as lenticular clouds, these strange phenomena are created when strong winds blow over a mountain range or hill, forming a wave shape that causes air to bounce downwind. These spectacular clouds form on top of the bounced air and appear to be stacked on top of each other.\n\nREAD MORE: Shoreditch skyline transformed by 50ft hologram displaying stunning visuals\n\nLenticular clouds are also known as UFO clouds or pancakes\n\nThey are not often seen in the UK and typically form to the side of mountains, with Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges often displaying them. The Met Office explained: \u201cThese lens-shaped orographic wave clouds form when the air is stable and winds blow across hills and mountains from the same or similar direction at different heights through the troposphere.\u201d They are said to be the most pronounced during either sunrise or sunset due to the low sun illuminating them. They are known to pose aviation hazards.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The national meteorological service added that skilled or brave glider pilots often prefer flying with these types of clouds in the sky as \u201cthey can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising\u201d.

More info\n\nLanarkshire has been named a UFO sighting hotspot by a group of researchers who recorded ten incidents over two years.\n\nAreas such as Hamilton, East Kilbride, Airdrie, Uddingston, and Cumbernauld were all witnesses to mysterious objects, which varied from cylindrical to star-like.\n\nLast year the British spotter group UFO Identified documented a total of 395 sightings in the UK in 2023, reports Lanarkshire Live. And from January 2021 to December 2023, the group logged ten sightings across Lanarkshire.\n\nThis included a cylindrical-shaped object flying with no vapour trail above Airdrie, an orange light that \u201cappeared to be making a tear in the sky\u201d in Uddingston and \u201cthree saucer shaped objects appearing stationary\u201d over Hamilton.\n\nSome sightings across the region happened on consecutive days, in different areas. A sphere was spotted over Cumbernauld on April 21, 2021, while a similar-shaped object was clocked the following day over Hamilton \u201cmoving oddly and hovering in the sky\u201d.\n\nAn orb was viewed above Cumbernauld on August 24, 2021, and appeared to be \u201cmoving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times\u201d, and the following day three objects were seen \u201cmoving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds\u201d above East Kilbride.\n\nThey are among 395 sightings across the United Kingdom \u2013 and an updated map reveals the extent of the unexplained activity taking place in the skies above us.\n\nUFOs have been in the news recently following a spate of sightings on the east coast of the United States. And last year the US Congress attempted to \u201cpull back the curtain\u201d on secret research into UFOs.\n\nThe hearing, titled \u2018Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\u2019 heard from several experts and a variety of witness accounts.\n\nUnidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) is the new name for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Experts included government workers and a member of NASA\u2019s UAP Independent Study Team.\n\nMichael Gold \u2013 former NASA associate administrator of space policy and partnerships and a member of the UAP study team \u2013 told the hearing that \u201cthe vast majority of UAP are drones\u201d.\n\nHowever, he added that there are anomalies that must be studied and admitted that some of the UAPs observed \u201ccan move faster\u201d than US assets and \u201care being intelligently controlled\u201d.\n\nAuthor and former Department of Defence official Luis Elizondo claimed that \u201cadvanced technologies not made by our government \u2013 or any other government \u2013 are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe.\u201d\n\nHe insisted: \u201cLet me be clear. UAP are real.\u201d\n\nThe hearing, jointly led by chairs Nancy Mace and Glenn Grothman, was the second to investigate the phenomenon of UAP.\n\n\u201cAmericans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings, and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose,\u201d the co-chairs said in a statement.\n\nThe hearing followed a long-awaited report released by NASA last year which studied previous sightings of UFOs (or UAPs) in the skies.\n\nWhile the report did not find any clear evidence that the sightings were alien, it did admit it was possible they could be.\n\nJust under half of all documented sightings in the UK (48 per cent) include photographic or video evidence. A quarter of all sightings (25 per cent) were of a \u201cstar-like\u201d object or objects, moving across the sky. The next most common sighting was of an unidentified object shaped like an \u201corb\u201d (17 per cent), \u201csphere\u201d, (10 per cent) and \u201ccylinder\u201d (nine per cent).\n\nOf all counties in the UK, Greater Manchester had more UFOs spotted in its skies than anywhere else, with 54 documented sightings. That was followed by Greater London (52), Cheshire (37), and West Sussex (34).\n\nWhen it comes to towns and cities, more UFO activity was seen above Glasgow than anywhere else, with 22 encounters \u2013 which possibly explains the high sightings in nearby Lanarkshire.\n\nJoin Glasgow Live's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nSIGHTINGS ACROSS LANARKSHIRE\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 21/04/2021\n\nDescription: Object moving north to east and then changed back to a northerly direction then disappeared.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Sphere\n\nDate spotted: 22/04/2021\n\nDescription: Reflective ball-object moving oddly and hovering in the sky.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 16/05/2021\n\nDescription: Two lights travelling parallel at slow speed, before fading away behind a cloud.\n\nCumbernauld\n\nShape of UFO: Orb\n\nDate spotted: 24/08/2021\n\nDescription: Light changed from white to red, moving back and forth in straight lines and hovering at times.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 25/08/2021\n\nDescription: Three objects moving back and forward, blinking then reappearing, rotating at various speeds.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 27/09/2021\n\nDescription: Triangular beam of light like a search light moving at a steady rate, brighter at the top.\n\nHamilton\n\nShape of UFO: Disc\n\nDate spotted: 28/12/2021\n\nDescription: Three saucer shaped objects appearing stationary, in photograph, not seen with naked eye.\n\nEast Kilbride\n\nShape of UFO: Star-Like\n\nDate spotted: 11/02/2022\n\nDescription: Three stars in a straight line formation, moving very fast from west to east then fading from view.\n\nAirdrie\n\nShape of UFO: Cylinder\n\nDate spotted: 27/06/2022\n\nDescription: Object \u2018like a plane with no wings\u2019 flying high up with no vapour trail.\n\nUddingston\n\nShape of UFO: Other\n\nDate spotted: 17/11/2023\n\nDescription: Orange light appeared to be making a tear in the sky.

[AP Photo/Evan Vucci]\n\n\u201cMedicine is a social science and politics nothing but medicine on a grand scale.\u201d\u2014Dr. Rudolph Virchow, known as \u201cthe father of modern pathology\u201d and the central figure in the emergence of public health in Germany\n\n\u201cI see the disinfectant which knocks it out in a minute \u2026 is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside for almost a cleaning? \u2026 Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it\u2019s ultraviolet or just very powerful light \u2026 supposing it brought the light inside the body, which you can either do through the skin or some other way.\u201d \u2014Donald Trump, April 2020\n\n***\n\nFive years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020, Donald Trump will return to the White House on Monday. More so than any other figure, Trump is identified with the disastrous official response to the pandemic, initiating a war on science and public health epitomized in the murderous \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy of deliberate mass infection and death.\n\nOver the course of 2020, Trump set into motion a basic pattern of lies, denial and anti-science disinformation. In his return to power, Trump II will likely be accompanied by the notorious purveyor of pseudoscience and anti-vaccine disinformation, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., slated to head the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nGregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, recently compared Kennedy heading the HHS to \u201cputting a flat earther in charge of NASA.\u201d A letter to the US Senate signed by more than 15,000 physicians warned:\n\nThe health and well-being of 336 million Americans depend on leadership at HHS that prioritizes science, evidence-based medicine, and strengthening the integrity of our public health system. RFK Jr. is not only unqualified to lead this essential agency\u2014he is actively dangerous.\n\nOn Friday, the New York Times reported that Kennedy filed a petition with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to revoke its authorization of all anti-COVID-19 vaccines in May 2021, as thousands of Americans were still dying from the disease each week.\n\nTrump\u2019s other public health appointees\u2014Great Barrington Declaration co-author Jay Bhattacharya to head the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dr. Mehmet Oz to head the Department of Medicare and Medicaid, anti-abortion fanatic Dave Weldon to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Fox News television doctor Janette Nesheiwat as Surgeon General, and Marty Makary to head the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2014amount to a rogue\u2019s gallery of some of the leading anti-science advocates throughout the pandemic. They have all denigrated or cast doubt on the COVID-19 vaccines and vociferously opposed virtually every public health measure that saved lives. Their aim is to put the final nail in the coffin of public health in the US, which will have vast global ramifications.\n\nUnder the banner \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d Trump, Kennedy and this gang of quacks will do everything in their power to facilitate the spread of disease, including previously eliminated pathogens like measles and new existential threats like H5N1 \u201cbird flu.\u201d\n\nBiden, having won the 2020 election in large part due to his pledges to \u201cfollow the science,\u201d steadily eviscerated every limited public health measure in place during his tenure in office. Over the past four years, Biden and the Democratic Party have implemented a bipartisan \u201cforever COVID\u201d policy of perpetual mass infection, debilitation and death, in the process overseeing the excess deaths of nearly 1 million Americans.\n\nThe cumulative toll of 5 years of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nContrary to the lies of capitalist politicians and the corporate media, the pandemic is by no means over. In fact, Trump returns to power amid the 10th wave of mass infection in the United States, with wastewater data showing that over 1 million Americans are being infected with COVID-19 every day and rising. This coincides with a surge in seasonal flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and norovirus, dubbed a \u201cquad-demic\u201d by health officials, with similar conditions in the UK and across Europe.\n\nThe corporate media in the US has provided scant coverage of this crisis, with virtually no mention of the central role played by COVID-19 or the horrific conditions that now exist in hospital systems across the country.\n\nIn just the last three months of 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were 9.3 million cases of flu, leading to 140,000 hospitalizations and 13,000 deaths, along with 1.2 million cases of RSV, causing 60,000 hospitalizations and 3,100 deaths.\n\nDue to inadequate testing, large numbers of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths go uncounted, but the CDC data show that at least 130,000 Americans were hospitalized and over 15,000 killed by COVID-19 in the same time period. While official figures show that over 50,000 Americans died of COVID-19 in 2024, excess death estimates by The Economist were roughly 120,000. In total, the US has now suffered over 1.5 million excess deaths, while the global figure is approaching 30 million.\n\nScientific studies indicate that over 20 million Americans and roughly 500 million people globally are now suffering from Long COVID, an often debilitating affliction that can impact virtually every organ in the body. Multiple rigorous studies have established that reinfections with COVID-19 compound one\u2019s risk of developing Long COVID. On average, every American has been infected with COVID at least three to four times since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nCognitive and motor fatigue scores in healthy control (HC), non-post-COVID syndrome (non-PCS), and post-COVID syndrome (PCS) patients [Photo by Charles James, J., Schulze, H., Siems, N. et al. Neurological post-COVID syndrome is associated with substantial impairment of verbal short-term and working memory. Sci Rep / CC BY 4.0\n\nA recent study on cognitive impairments associated with neurological Long COVID found that these patients exhibited higher rates of fatigue, depression and anxiety and did worse on cognitive tests. They had impairments in their mental flexibility, verbal short-term memory, working memory and processing speed. These findings are proven every day in the real-life experiences of millions of workers and professionals, for whom the chronic disabling disease has caused significant daily disruptions to every aspect of their lives.\n\nFurthermore, recent studies have found an association between common non-COVID infections and non-communicable diseases later in life, including stomach cancer and cirrhosis. Multiple infections earlier in life have shown deleterious impacts on overall health, underscoring the importance of infection prevention and indicating the vast potential health ramifications of the \u201cforever COVID\u201d policy.\n\nGrowing danger of an H5N1 \u201cbird flu\u201d pandemic\n\nBeyond the acute and long-term physical damage caused by the pandemic, its social, political and even psychological consequences have been far-reaching. Above all, the capitalist response to the pandemic has exposed the ruling class\u2019s visceral hatred for public health and determination to lower life expectancy in the working class.\n\nThis has found concentrated expression in the Biden administration\u2019s non-response to the escalating threat of an H5N1 \u201cbird flu\u201d pandemic, which has been greeted with a collective shrug. The announcement last month of the first human death from bird flu in the US is a stark reminder of how unprepared the world remains for another pandemic. Historically, bird flu has had a documented case fatality rate of roughly 50 percent.\n\nThe man who has overseen the response to the bird flu outbreak in the US, USDA head Tom Vilsack, is intimately connected to the agribusiness, meat and dairy industries and has directly profited from these connections throughout his political career. Under Vilsack\u2019s direction, the Biden administration has done nothing to stop the spread of bird flu among cattle over the past year, which so far has likely infected hundreds of farmworkers.\n\nTom Vilsack [Photo: Tom Witham]\n\nRegardless of whether the next pandemic is bird flu, mpox or some other disease, the response will once again amount to extreme nationalism and the promotion of a eugenicist and fascistic \u201cherd immunity\u201d policy.\n\nThere have already been articles published by the same purveyors of dinisformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the Brownstone Institute and the War Room podcast hosted by Steve Bannon, falsely claiming that bird flu is a hoax or another lab leak engineered by Anthony Fauci, a conspiracy theory which Bannon pioneered in January 2020 with the Wuhan Lab Lie.\n\nThe danger of a bird flu pandemic will only worsen under Trump and Kennedy, as the latter has actively promoted the consumption of unpasteurized raw milk, well known to increase the risk of bird flu infections among humans.\n\nSocialist public health vs. capitalist barbarism\n\nThe bipartisan assault on public health has had disastrous and far-reaching consequences. In a recent widely-read interview with the World Socialist Web Site, noted COVID researcher Dr. Arijit Chakravarty summarized the historic assault on public health, which has taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic, stating:\n\nThis is what failure looks like. We are looking at it. No one ever said when the concept of public health emerged in the 19th century, \u201cWe really need an organization that is committed to serving as the doula for every newly emergent pathogen that pops out of the wild.\u201d The idea that emergent pathogens need to be shepherded into endemicity, this has never been in any public health mission statement\u2026 There really is no historical precedent for this. No society in the world ever said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re infected? Let\u2019s let it spread.\u201d This whole concept of pox parties being a thing is ludicrous. But that\u2019s exactly where we are today. Quarantines used to happen in the 14th century with plague. This uncritical acceptance of infectious disease as a sort of lord and savior is brand new.\n\nIndeed, the open repudiation of the most basic principles of public health over the past five years is, except under police state and fascist regimes, unprecedented in modern history. Alongside the ongoing genocide in Gaza, the normalization of the use of nuclear weapons in the US-NATO war against Russia, and the global rise of fascist politicians, the attacks on science and public health during an active pandemic epitomize the modern descent into capitalist barbarism.\n\nThe intersection of the emergence of public health as a discipline and the development of Marxism was not incidental. Only three years after Friedrich Engels published his seminal 1845 work, The Condition of the Working Class in England, in 1848 the distinguished German physician and progressive liberal Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902) was commissioned by the central government in Berlin to investigate a typhus epidemic that had erupted in the depressed and impoverished Eastern province of Prussia.\n\nRudolf Virchow (1821-1902)\n\nVirchow\u2019s report was an indictment of the abject poverty and squalid living conditions that affected the Silesian peasants. Noting that the epidemic was concentrated among the poorest and malnourished who became more vulnerable to the disease, Virchow stressed that the typhus epidemic was more a social problem than a medical issue, and that it could only be prevented through the ending of \u201csocial inequality.\u201d He advocated for \u201cfull and unlimited democracy\u201d and \u201ceducation, freedom and prosperity\u201d for all.\n\nIn an article about Virchow\u2019s work published in the Global Health Journal in 2021, coinciding with the deadliest year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Klause W. Lange wrote:\n\nIn the German revolution of 1848, Virchow became an activist committed to revolutionary social change. During the year of the revolution, he remained politically very active, was amongst those manning the barricades in Berlin and founded the weekly newspaper \u201cDie Medicinische Reform\u201d (Medical Reform), written for a mass readership. Virchow\u2019s medical studies of social etiology, combined with his political radicalism, led him to characterize himself as a socialist with the primary objective of improving the welfare of the working class.\n\nOne of Virchow\u2019s fundamental theories that proved prophetic and correct was his postulate that the impact of social circumstances and inequality contribute to the dissemination of illness and the emergence of epidemics, and that the equitable distribution of society\u2019s resources would ameliorate these epidemics. As Virchow said then, medicine extends beyond just the treatment of disease and must encompass measures that address the health and well-being of the entire population.\n\nVirchow\u2019s four principles for reforming medicine included:\n\nPeople\u2019s health is a matter of social concern. Economic and social conditions have major effects on health and disease, which must be scientifically studied. Promoting health and combatting disease must include both social and medical measures. Medical statistics provide the standard of measurement.\n\nVirchow also advocated for the prohibition of child labor and protection of pregnant women from occupational exposures to toxic substances.\n\nMuch of Virchow\u2019s revolutionary perspectives towards public health found fertile ground in the aftermath of the October 1917 Russian Revolution led by Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, which completed the overthrow of the Tsarist autocracy. By bringing an end to World War I and directing resources to the revolutionary democratic and socialist transformation of the country, and thereby addressing the high rates of infant and maternal mortality, the Bolshevik regime rapidly increased life expectancy for the entire population.\n\nLenin addressing a crowd of revolutionary workers in Petrograd in 1919. Trotsky is on the right. [Photo: Wikipedia]\n\nThe social gains that have been made over the past century, including numerous mass vaccination campaigns, vast improvements in sanitation and food industries, safe drinking water, and the science of health, have led to a doubling of life expectancy across the globe.\n\nHowever, in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and especially in the last two decades, these hard-won social gains began to be clawed back by the corporate and financial aristocracy, with life expectancy for working people steadily declining in comparison to the more affluent layers of society. The COVID-19 pandemic has starkly exacerbated and entrenched these inequities.\n\nThe appointment of RFK Jr. and the second Trump administration will quickly accelerate these decades-long processes. Only the working class has the means and objective interests in reversing these trajectories through socialist revolution on an international scale. The attack on public health is foremost an attack on the social value created by the working class.\n\nIn Volume I of Capital, Karl Marx wrote:\n\nHence Capital is reckless of the health or length of life of the labourer, unless under compulsion from society. To the out-cry as to the physical and mental degradation, the premature death, the torture of over-work, it answers: Ought these to trouble us since they increase our profits? But looking at things as a whole, all this does not, indeed, depend on the good or ill will of the individual capitalist. Free competition brings out the inherent laws of capitalist production, in the shape of external coercive laws having power over every individual capitalist.\n\nThe same class forces and profit imperatives described by Marx over 150 years ago have only strengthened in the 21st century, as capitalism descends into modern barbarism.\n\nThe naked rule of the oligarchy, embodied in Trump, RFK Jr., their close ally Elon Musk and the entire incoming administration, must and will be opposed by the development of a powerful socialist movement in the American and international working class.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, the World Socialist Web Site and the International Committee of the Fourth International alone have advanced a revolutionary strategy to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to protect the health and lives of the working class and the entire population. In opposition to the bourgeois propaganda and efforts to normalize the pandemic, which has produced a crippling fatalism among many anti-COVID advocates, the WSWS has relentlessly gathered and published information through the Global Workers\u2019 Inquest into the COVID-19 Pandemic, as part of our broader efforts to educate the working class and build a socialist leadership.\n\nThe only viable policy toward COVID-19 is one of global elimination, which requires the universal deployment of all available public health measures and the renovation of all indoor public spaces with HEPA filters and Far-UVC technology. Not only would these measures stop the COVID-19 pandemic, but they would also lay the foundations for eliminating the flu, RSV and other pathogens that needlessly plague humanity, while creating the necessary public health infrastructure to prevent future pandemics.\n\nThe WSWS and ICFI renew our call for an alliance between principled scientists and the working class, the two interdependent forces whose combined strength is the only means to stop the capitalist war on public health and science, and rebuild global society on the basis of scientific economic planning."
