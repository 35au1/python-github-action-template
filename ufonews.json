            "article_content": "We need less uproar over everyday drones and more critical attention about ones near airports and other restricted airspace\n\nDecember\u2019s spate of drone sightings seen in New Jersey and spreading nationwide, sure looks familiar. As does its associated media frenzy\u2014culminating in memes and conspiracy theories about so-called \u201cmystery drones.\u201d The episode bears an eerie resemblance to the UFO phenomenon, or the unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) one, that spiked in recent years and has led to significant congressional attention and legislation.\n\nIn a way, this is progress. The reason this outbreak looks so familiar is that such drone sightings would previously have been identified as UAP ones. It\u2019s only after years of concerted efforts in education, and transparency by U.S. Department of Defense officials, that UAP sightings have rightfully evolved into common drone identification. That is not to say that the drone sightings are any less of a concern, but fortunately, we can address them without the contagion of the UFO community and the conspiracies associated with it.\n\nUnfortunately, our response has been no less irrational.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nA New Jersey state assemblyman has accused federal officials of \u201clying to us\u201d about drones on CNN. The president-elect suggested we \u201cshoot them down!!!\u201d which is almost (but only almost, sadly) needless to say, a bad idea. So is wasting resources to investigate nonsensical notions of advanced technology related to Iran or, again, aliens. Calls for shooting objects down not only have obvious safety issues but fail to recall that Congress and the White House limited such strikes over U.S. territory after the incidents involving the Chinese high-altitude balloon and other balloons, based on concerns about civilian safety.\n\nThere are a couple of things we need to make clear about the drone sightings. First, many of the sightings remain mistaken interpretations of manned aircraft or satellites such as Starlink ones. The real drone sightings fall into two classes: those that are in restricted airspace, and those that are in legal airspace. Restricted airspace surrounds airports as well as national security areas such as Air Force and Navy bases. Most sightings reported fall within the latter category and have been assessed as having no immediate national security or flight safety risk, although the public finds them annoying.\n\nOne fact that many people tend to overlook, or at least don\u2019t readily rationalize, is that these drones have lights on them. That lights are present on various flying objects including drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs) is a fact I often referred to in my last job, heading a Pentagon office investigating UAP sightings. Lights on a drone are for collision avoidance. They are a safety feature. Flying drones with lights ensures they can be seen; if they were meant to be unnoticed, the operators would turn off or disable the lights. In September 2023, the FAA changed the rules to allow drones to fly at night this way, and this is likely a contributing factor to the increase in sightings. The public and elected officials in Congress continue to believe lights in the sky are scary, however, particularly when they mistake crewed aircraft for drones.\n\nCongressional officials and that unfortunate source of information, social media, continue to make unfounded claims of drone technologies far ahead of U.S. capabilities. The most recent example being the assertion that drones flew from an Iranian mother ship off the coast of the U.S. and demonstrated seven or eight hours of battery life. That fantastic assertion requires there to be evidence that the drones originated from an Iranian ship and were tracked continuously to the U.S. cities. There are no such tracks. The more rational explanation is that they originated near the place of the sighting, that is from domestic operators.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean some drone operations aren\u2019t ill-intentioned.\n\nSeveral hypotheses (apart from mistaken identity) might explain these drones in legal airspace. They might be academic, professional or hobbyist domestic operators exploring a new technology. YouTube overflows with drone footage from amateur photographers all over the world. Flying in urban settings, in legal airspace, for photography or maybe even some research such as high resolution thermal or pollution measurements is very plausible. Or they are commercial. Increased commercial activity is unavoidable as industry advances drone technology for delivery, remote sensing and communications.\n\nMore concerning, operators could be probing the limits of legal activities, or in military speak, performing or exploring preparation of the battlespace. Whether foreign or domestic bad actors, they could be flying commercial drones, complete with lights, to test reactions of both the public and the government. As long as they are flying within legal airspace, under legal limits, they can push those limits and measure what the reaction is. That information on reactions and response could readily feed back to some sort of attack planning, illegal drug delivery or other malicious intent.\n\nFinally, the operators could be using them intentionally to whip up frenzy, hysteria and panic. It could be for personal gain (such as claiming they have the anti-UAV solution to sell), or perhaps advertising something resembling another History Channel series on aliens.\n\nMuch like the UAP problem, there is little evidence to support, or rule out, any of these hypotheses. Like UAP, the drones don\u2019t likely all have the same explanation. That makes it hard from a national security perspective to distinguish when a sighting is benign versus potentially nefarious. Lest we forget the lessons of the ongoing war on Ukraine, we don\u2019t want to be caught in an intelligence or technical surprise.\n\nMeanwhile, the sightings that are clearly in restricted airspace usually have more obvious intentions. These can range from benign to nefarious, but generally center around seeing things that are normally not allowed. Whether this is military aircraft, commercial airports or operations, these clearly identified drones and balloons with payloads pose not only a security risk but also a flight safety risk. It would only take one small quad copter to get sucked into a commercial jet engine to end in tragedy.\n\nThe proliferation of drone technology, in its commercial, recreational, scientific and military uses, is clearly disrupting the world around us. Our legislation and regulation have created an environment that allows for legal drone usage. It should come as no surprise then that drones are in the air and increasing. Yet here we are, once again with more extraordinary claims, public demands for transparency, baseless accusations of hiding the truth, and congressional calls for more legislation over a mystery in the sky, instead of a rational scientific approach to the investigation. Sound familiar?\n\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump carries a pair of his new signature shoes before taking the stage at Sneaker Con at the Philadelphia Convention Center on February 17, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nCampaign catchphrases aside, we can probably all agree that this was a very weird year in politics, particularly in Pennsylvania, the swingiest of swing states. Before we look ahead to 2025 let\u2019s review the ways Pennsylvania\u2019s politics and politicians got a little (or a lot) weird in 2024.\n\nAs unlikely as it may seem, President-elect Donald Trump did, in fact, take the stage at Sneaker Con in Philly back in February to unveil an official sneaker: gold high-tops with American flag logos, available for pre-order at $399 (limit three pairs per customer). Reporter John Cole had to convince his editor it wasn\u2019t a social media joke, and ended up with a front row seat despite little advance notice from the campaign about where and how to catch Trump\u2019s appearance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump admitted the sneakerhead crowd was \u201ca slightly different audience than I\u2019m used to,\u201d but also said launching the shoe line was something he had wanted to do for \u201ca long time.\u201d He did not wear the shoes on stage. And further proving that politics make strange bedfellows, we discovered that according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the president of Sneaker Con made donations to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and a Trump-affiliated PAC, although in relatively small amounts.\n\nDuring a budget hearing in February, the head of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) talked about the agency tracking UFO sightings, to the surprise of committee chairperson Jordan Harris. It took a while to receive them, but senior reporter Peter Hall sought records on the sightings, which showed PEMA investigated more than a dozen incidents over the past decade.\n\nThe sightings included mysterious lights following a motorist on a dark country road, a saucer-shaped craft hovering over a suburban subdivision, and a flaming orb falling into the woods, the records show. Many of the incidents are reported to Stan Gordon, a Westmoreland County resident who operates a 24-hour UFO, bigfoot and cryptid reporting hotline, who said the line has \u201cnever stopped ringing\u201d since the Kecksburg UFO incident of 1965.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always taken these cases very open mindedly,\u201d Gordon told the Capital-Star \u201cWe approach them scientifically.\u201d\n\nMold in a government office does not seem like the kind of situation that would require a whistleblower, but here we are. A staffer at Rep. Eric Davanzo\u2019s (R-Westmoreland) district office in West Newton complained of foul odors, and bought tests to check for the presence of mold. That didn\u2019t go over too well when the tests came back positive, and she was later fired. She sued for wrongful termination and the Commonwealth Court ruled she could move forward with a whistleblower lawsuit.\n\nFirst things first: If you want to try to modify the weather in Pennsylvania, you need a license \u2014 but since the law took effect in 1967 no one has applied for one (we asked).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin), former GOP nominee for governor, claims that new technology and a proliferation of weather modification patents \u201cowned by a combination of Federal Government Agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations, and large multinational corporations\u201d have brought forward the need to update Pennsylvania\u2019s law. He wrote a memo seeking co-sponsor for legislation he intends to introduce.\n\nThe legislation would ban the release of substances within the borders of Pennsylvania to affect the temperature, weather or intensity of sunlight, and appears to be rooted in the false belief that condensation trails left by high flying aircraft are actually trails of chemicals \u2014 aka chemtrails \u2014 released by the government for nefarious reasons, that has become conflated with techniques being explored to reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the atmosphere.\n\nIt\u2019s not often you get the opportunity to write a story with so much potential to use the phrase \u201cred wave.\u201d Alas, it only occurred to our headline writer much later (which, truly, is probably for the best). In June, Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton) objected to a bill to create a grant program that would make pads and tampons free for public school students. She didn\u2019t like that the bill\u2019s cosponsorship memo referred to menstruating women as \u201cpeople,\u201d and claimed the bill was \u201cjust another step by the governor and Democrats to have government provide everything for you, which leads to communism.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s prime sponsors, Rep. Darisha Parker (D-Philadelphia), said the bill would serve to \u201crestore the dignity to these women and girls who have gone unsupported far too long.\u201d\n\nThe bill passed the House by a vote of 117 to 85. It did not advance in the Senate."

Multiple countries have been known to be attempting to develop a sixth-generation fighter, including China, the US and Russia. Other countries have joined forces on sixth-gen projects, such as the UK, Japan and Italy in the Global Combat Air Programme, and France, Germany and Spain with FCAS. Sixth-generation fighter concepts share several distinct characteristics, such as the inclusion of AI and advanced stealth capabilities. If the jet spotted in the video footage is indeed a sixth-generation fighter jet, then China appears to have taken a significant step forward at the front of the race. The debut of the J-36 jet challenges US superiority in the skies and could have serious implications for India, which currently lacks a stealth fighter jet. It is anticipated the US will deploy its first sixth-generation fighter to the field around 2030.\n\n6 The new jet, on the left, accompanied by a Chinese Chengdu J-20S Credit: X\n\nThe demo of the new plane comes just a month after China unveiled the J-35 fighter jet, which bore a striking similarity to an American design, the F-35.\n\nIt was even claimed that the fifth generation fighter was built from designs for the American craft which were stolen by Xi Jinping's agents.\n\nAt the airshow the China released plans for a mysterious \"White Emperor\" jet design - capable of dropping devastating weapons from space.\n\nHowever, it is not thought this was the design captured in the recent footage.\n\nChina is also vying to take on the US \"Son of Concorde\" with an even faster supersonic jet that could blast from London to New York City in less than two hours.\n\nBeijing-based Space Transportation - also known as Lingkong Tianxing Technology - has been carrying out test flights and recently reached a speed of 3,106 mph which is four times the speed of sound, according to Chinese media.\n\n6 There has been no official information released about the new jet Credit: X"

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence is rewriting the rules of innovation, with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, and Alphabet's Gemini demonstrating remarkable abilities across domains. However, a recent study titled \"Age Against the Machine - Susceptibility of Large Language Models to Cognitive Impairment: Cross-Sectional Analysis\", published in the BMJ (British Medical Journal), challenges the assumption that AI tools can flawlessly replace human professionals, particularly in medicine. Conducted by researchers from Hadassah Medical Center and Tel Aviv University, the study explored the \"cognitive abilities\" of leading LLMs using established neurological tests like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).\n\nThe findings reveal a nuanced perspective on AI's strengths and limitations. While these models excel at many tasks, they show significant weaknesses in visuospatial and executive functions, raising questions about their reliability in critical applications such as healthcare diagnostics.\n\nCognitive decline in AI\n\nThe study evaluated five large language models - ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.0, and Gemini 1.5 - by administering the MoCA test, a tool used to detect cognitive impairments in humans. The test includes tasks that assess attention, memory, language, and executive functions, providing a maximum score of 30 points. To complement the MoCA test, the researchers also employed tools like the Stroop test and visuospatial diagnostics, including the Navon figure and Poppelreuter figure.\n\nResults showed that ChatGPT 4o achieved the highest MoCA score (26/30), followed by ChatGPT 4 and Claude (25/30), while Gemini 1.0 scored the lowest (16/30), indicating signs of mild cognitive impairment. Despite their strong performance in areas like attention and language, all models struggled with visuospatial and executive tasks, such as the trail-making and cube-copying exercises. Notably, ChatGPT 4o was the only model to successfully complete the incongruent stage of the Stroop test, further emphasizing the disparity in performance across cognitive domains.\n\nThe study revealed several critical insights about the limitations of AI systems:\n\nVisuospatial Deficits: All models displayed difficulty with tasks requiring visuospatial reasoning. For instance, none could complete the clock-drawing test accurately, a common indicator of cognitive decline in humans. These deficits suggest that current LLMs are ill-equipped to handle tasks requiring visual abstraction and executive function.\n\nAge-Related Cognitive Decline: The study highlighted a striking parallel between human aging and AI model updates. \"Older\" versions of LLMs, such as Gemini 1.0, performed worse than their \"younger\" counterparts like Gemini 1.5. This finding raises questions about the longevity and reliability of AI models over time.\n\nEmpathy and Contextual Understanding: When tested with visual cues like the cookie theft scene, none of the models demonstrated concern for the depicted scenario, such as a boy about to fall. This absence of empathy underscores the limitations of AI in understanding nuanced human contexts, particularly in fields requiring emotional intelligence, like healthcare.\n\nCan AI Replace human physicians?\n\nIn recent years, LLMs have shown remarkable potential in medical applications, outperforming human doctors in various board examinations. Yet, this study challenges the narrative of AI's infallibility in clinical roles. For example, the inability to perform visuospatial tasks or exhibit contextual awareness diminishes their reliability in medical diagnostics. Patients may question the competence of an AI tool that struggles with tasks it is designed to evaluate, potentially undermining trust in AI-driven healthcare systems.\n\nFurthermore, the findings emphasize the need for caution when integrating AI into clinical workflows. While LLMs can enhance efficiency and provide supplementary insights, they lack the holistic understanding and adaptability of human physicians, particularly in complex or ambiguous scenarios.\n\nThe study's findings extend beyond healthcare. The limitations observed in LLMs' cognitive abilities reflect broader challenges in AI development. While these models excel at processing large datasets and generating coherent textual outputs, their struggles with visuospatial reasoning and contextual tasks highlight a critical gap in their design.\n\nAddressing these limitations will require advancements in the integration of multimodal capabilities, allowing AI systems to process and interpret both textual and visual data more effectively. Additionally, developers must prioritize ethical considerations, ensuring that AI tools are transparent about their capabilities and limitations to prevent misuse.\n\nA call for ethical and collaborative AI development\n\nThe researchers advocate for a collaborative approach to AI development, combining human expertise with machine efficiency. They emphasize the importance of creating systems that augment human capabilities rather than attempting to replace them. In healthcare, for instance, AI can assist with preliminary diagnoses or administrative tasks, freeing up physicians to focus on patient care.\n\nThe study also calls for increased transparency and public engagement in AI research. By involving stakeholders from diverse fields, developers can create tools that are both effective and ethical, addressing societal concerns about the potential misuse of AI technologies.\n\nTo put it succinctly, while LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini demonstrate impressive capabilities, their struggles with visuospatial and contextual tasks highlight the gap between machine intelligence and human cognition. These findings challenge the assumption that AI will seamlessly replace human professionals, particularly in fields like medicine."

Interestingly, Paul McCartney was asked if he ever had a supernatural experience and he went on to reveal his views on ghosts.\n\nA lot of classic rock got pretty mystical. Interestingly, Paul McCartney was asked if he ever had a supernatural experience and he went on to reveal his views on ghosts. Other members of The Beatles had plenty to say about the paranormal.\n\nWhat Paul McCartney did when his kids were afraid of ghosts\n\nThe Beatles had plenty to say about faith. John Lennon got in a lot of trouble proclaiming that The Beatles were \u201cmore popular than Jesus.\u201d He later penned the atheist/communist anthem \u201cImagine.\u201d Meanwhile, George Harrison famously converted to Hinduism. His faith had a significant impact on his work with The Beatles and on his solo career. Paul\u2019s views on these topics have not received nearly as much attention.\n\nDuring a 2024 interview from PaulMcCartney.com, a fan asked the \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed\u201d singer was asked if he had ever encountered the supernatural. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he replied. \u201cNot really.\n\n\u201cMy dreams are very supernatural, I can go anywhere there,\u201d he added. \u201cBut not in real life. I\u2019ve never actually seen a ghost or a spirit, and I\u2019m not a great believer in all that. A lot of it comes from raising kids: when they\u2019d say, \u2018Dad, I\u2019m scared of ghosts,\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018There\u2019s no such thing.\u2019 You do a lot of that as a parent.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018Band on the Run\u2019 singer has similar views of ghosts and religion\n\nThe \u201cSilly Love Songs\u201d singer went on to denounce the entire concept of the supernatural. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t believe in it,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think the human mind is susceptible to getting a bit worked up and overexcited, and often these things have a rational explanation in the end.\u201d\n\nDuring a 2012 interview with The Independent, Paul was asked if religion plays a meaningful role in his life. \u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a kind of personal faith in something good, but it doesn\u2019t really go much further than that. It\u2019s certainly not subscribing to any organized religion.\u201d\n\nPaul went on to denounce mainstream religion. \u201cI think that [organized religion] is the cause of a lot of trouble \u2014 \u2018My god is better than yours,'\u201d he opined. \u201cBut I do think there is something greater than me \u2026 and that\u2019s not easy to imagine.\u201d Paul didn\u2019t explain what the \u201csomething greater\u201d was supposed to be, but given his other comments, we can probably assume it\u2019s not a standard conception of God.\n\nJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney agreed on something\n\nWhile John and Paul did not see eye-to-eye on many subjects, they said similar things about mysticism. During a 1980 interview in the book All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono, the \u201cWhatever Gets You Thru the Night\u201d star said he viewed magic simply as science which had yet to be explained. Like Paul, his views on the subject were ultimately naturalistic.\n\nWhile Paul isn\u2019t a believer, supernatural concepts impacted The Beatles\u2019 work. One of their most famous album tracks is called \u201cMagical Mystery Tour.\u201d In the 1997 book Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now, the singer said \u201cThe Fool on the Hill\u201d was inspired by The Fool, one of the most famous tarot cards.\n\nWhether you believe in the supernatural or not, we can all agree The Beatles\u2019 music is magic."

Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThe small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning.\n\nMs Rassalle explained: \"The purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\" She continued: \u201cThese amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world but they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nThe feature is currently available to limited users\n\nWhat is YouTube's 'Play something' feature and how it works\n\nBy Dwaipayan Roy 11:42 am Dec 28, 202411:42 am\n\nWhat's the story YouTube has announced a new feature aimed at improving user experience on its platform. The video-sharing giant has added a \"Play something\" button in its Android app, 9to5Google reported. The feature, which is still in the testing stage, plays random videos according to your viewing preferences and habits. This may include both Shorts and normal videos.\n\nUsage\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe \"Play something\" button appears in the lower right corner of the UI on YouTube's Android app. Tapping on it will play a random YouTube Short matching your preferences. However, the next videos triggered by the feature may not be Shorts. The feature is not widely available yet and has only been spotted on the Brazilian version of the app.\n\nFeature evolution\n\nA step toward seamless content discovery\n\nThe current 'Play something' button is an evolved version of a similar feature tested last year. The previous version was embedded into the home screen feed, while the latest iteration seems to be a permanent fixture in the UI. This development indicates YouTube's ongoing efforts to streamline content discovery and consumption for its users, by reducing decision-making friction when opening the app.\n\nAvailability\n\nLimited rollout of the new feature\n\nThe new 'Play something' button has been spotted in version 19.5 of the YouTube Android app. However, it is not yet available for all users running this version, suggesting a limited rollout at this stage. This strategy is in line with YouTube's usual practice of gradually introducing new features to its user base."

            "article_content": "In a blog post Friday, OpenAI laid out its early plans for changing its corporate structure to allow for more capital raising and growth.\n\nOpenAI said its existing for-profit division will become a public benefit corporation, or PBC, \"with ordinary shares of stock.\"\n\nThe PBC will oversee commercial operations, and the nonprofit will hire a staff to pursue charitable initiatives, OpenAI said.\n\nOpenAI said Friday that in moving toward a new for-profit structure in 2025, the company will create a public benefit corporation to oversee commercial operations, removing some of its nonprofit restrictions and allowing it to function more like a high-growth startup.\n\n\"The hundreds of billions of dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission,\" OpenAI's board wrote in the post. \"We once again need to raise more capital than we'd imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness.\"\n\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox.> Sign up for NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nThe pressure on OpenAI is tied to its $157 billion valuation, achieved in the two years since the company launched its viral chatbot, ChatGPT, and kicked off the boom in generative artificial intelligence. OpenAI closed its latest $6.6 billion round in October, gearing up to aggressively compete with Elon Musk's xAI as well as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Anthropic in a market that's predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\n\nDeveloping the large language models at the heart of ChatGPT and other generative AI products requires an ongoing investment in high-powered processors, provided largely by Nvidia, and cloud infrastructure, which OpenAI largely receives from top backer Microsoft.\n\nOpenAI expects about $5 billion in losses on $3.7 billion in revenue this year, CNBC confirmed in September. Those numbers are increasing rapidly.\n\nBy transforming into a Delaware PBC \"with ordinary shares of stock,\" OpenAI says it can pursue commercial operations, while separately hiring a staff for its nonprofit arm and allowing that wing to take on charitable activities in health care, education and science.\n\nThe nonprofit will have a \"significant interest\" in the PBC \"at a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors,\" OpenAI wrote.\n\nOpenAI's complicated structure as it exists today is the result of its creation as a nonprofit in 2015. It was founded by CEO Sam Altman, Musk and others as a research lab focused on artificial general intelligence, or AGI, which was an entirely futuristic concept at the time.\n\nIn 2019, OpenAI aimed to move past its role as solely a research lab in hopes of functioning more like a startup, so it created a so-called capped-profit model, with the nonprofit still controlling the overall entity.\n\n\"Our current structure does not allow the Board to directly consider the interests of those who would finance the mission and does not enable the nonprofit to easily do more than control the for-profit,\" OpenAI wrote in Friday's post.\n\nOpenAI added that the change would \"enable us to raise the necessary capital with conventional terms like our competitors.\"\n\nMusk's opposition\n\nOpenAI's efforts to restructure face some major hurdles. The most significant is Musk, who is in the midst of a heated legal battle with Altman that could have a significant impact on the company's future.\n\nIn recent months, Musk has sued OpenAI and asked a court to stop the company from converting to a for-profit corporation from a nonprofit. In posts on X, he described that effort as a \"total scam\" and claimed that \"OpenAI is evil.\" Earlier this month, OpenAI clapped back, alleging that in 2017 Musk \"not only wanted, but actually created, a for-profit\" to serve as the company's proposed new structure.\n\nIn addition to its face-off with Musk, OpenAI has been dealing with an outflow of high-level talent, due in part to concerns that the company has focused on taking commercial products to market at the expense of safety.\n\nIn late September, OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati announced she would depart the company after 6\u00bd years. That same day, research chief Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, a research vice president, also announced they were leaving. A month earlier, co-founder John Schulman said he was leaving for rival startup Anthropic.\n\nAltman said during a September interview at Italian Tech Week that recent executive departures were not related to the company's potential restructuring: \"We have been thinking about that \u2014 our board has \u2014 for almost a year independently, as we think about what it takes to get to our next stage,\" he said.\n\nThose weren't the first big-name exits. In May, OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever and former safety leader Jan Leike announced their departures, with Leike also joining Anthropic.\n\nLeike wrote in a social media post at the time that disagreements with leadership about company priorities drove his decision.\n\n\"Over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products,\" he wrote.\n\nOne employee, who worked under Leike, quit soon after him, writing on X in September that \"OpenAI was structured as a non-profit, but it acted like a for-profit.\" The employee added, \"You should not believe OpenAI when it promises to do the right thing later.\"\n\nWATCH: OpenAI announces o3 and o3 mini models"

            "article_content": "Payments trends in 2024 and beyond are largely impacted by technology and the state of the economy. We\u2019re seeing a decline in discretionary spending, and an increase in the number of ways consumers like to make payments. Plus, AI and biometrics are also impacting payment security and fraud prevention.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll walk you through a few digital payment trends\u200b to watch as you prepare your business for the future of payment processing.\n\n1. Diversified payment methods\n\nOne of the more well-known global payment trends\u200b is payment method diversity. There are so many ways to make payments these days. I can choose cash, card, mobile app, QR code, tap to pay, buy now and pay later (BNPL), or even cryptocurrency.\n\nAccording to a survey by Square, preferences are pretty widespread across the board. While 58% of consumers still use cash, 57% prefer mobile wallets, and 53% use QR code payments. Another 44% use traditional credit and debit cards, 44% use touchless card payments, and 43% use BNPL.\n\nBNPL is particularly notable, as it\u2019s now being adopted in more industry verticals than before. Groceries, for example, may be available for purchase via BNPL. In fact, BNPL grocery purchases increased by 40% between 2023 and 2024, according to Deloitte. This is a direct response to the current economic and political climate, which is causing a decrease in discretionary spending.\n\nThe list of payment options will only continue to grow as the economy moves further away from cash and check and towards innovative payment methods like NFC or biometric payments. This also means considering options like subscriptions, cryptocurrency, saved payments, bill splitting, peer-to-peer (P2P), and gift cards.\n\nHere\u2019s another interesting stat from Deloitte: 70% of consumers say their store choice is highly influenced by whether or not the store offers their preferred payment method. It is therefore important for businesses to keep up.\n\nRelated: Best crypto payment gateways\n\nCash vs cashless\n\nToday\u2019s consumers like convenience and options. I remember when it was just a cash or credit world\u2014now, consumers can choose to pay for their purchases in many ways.\n\nHowever, according to data from Square, about 58% of shoppers still prefer cash. In fact, some trends are even indicating a move back to cash and away from digitization.\n\nSo, there\u2019s really no clear winner in a cash vs. cashless debate. The real answer for businesses is to create ways to allow customers to pay with or without cash.\n\nRelated: What is a cashless society? From speculation to near-reality\n\nMobile payments and digital wallets\n\nMobile payments and digital wallets\u2014like Apple Pay and Google Pay\u2014are another payment trend that has been around for a while but continues to impact businesses everywhere, especially as this technology evolves.\n\nPer Deloitte, 57% of consumers prefer to pay with mobile wallet apps. Digital wallets actually made up 37% of transaction value for e-commerce payments and 15% of POS payments in North America in 2023.\n\nContactless pay can also fall under the category of mobile payments. Mobile payments involve the use of NFC technology so a customer can hold up their phone or smartwatch to the reader rather than having to insert a chip or swipe a card. The contactless payment market is also expected to see major growth\u2014at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 113% through 2029, according to Juniper Research.\n\nRelated: Top mobile payment methods\n\nCrypto payments\n\nCryptocurrency payments skyrocketed in popularity when they were first introduced. The trend did lose some steam partly due to regulatory challenges, currency volatility, susceptibility to fraud, and low confidence in the currency\u2019s viability over the long term, perhaps thanks to the FTX scandal and collapse.\n\nWith this doubt, the crypto payments market is only forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 17% through 2029.\n\nHowever, since Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, crypto and bitcoin have seen a resurgence of popularity in the United States.\n\n2. Biometrics features\n\nBiometric payments are experiencing a surge in growth, with forecasts to grow at a CAGR of 113.6% from 2024 through 2028, per Juniper Research. Some forecasts even say it will be the norm within the next decade. These payments incorporate biometric technology\u2014usually in the form of fingerprint or facial recognition\u2014to improve both data privacy and transaction convenience.\n\nSecurity is a top concern for businesses, both themselves and their customers. This is especially important when it comes to payments\u2014there\u2019s lots of sensitive information going around, so businesses are always looking for ways to tighten things up from a security perspective. Biometric payments are another layer of security that can help accomplish this.\n\nNot only does biometric authentication help boost security, but it also makes login and connection more efficient. I can\u2019t tell you how many passwords I have to remember\u2014if I can use my fingerprint or my face to authenticate something instead, that\u2019s one less password I have to keep track of. And remember, shoppers love efficiency and convenience.\n\n3. AI to facilitate and fight fraud\n\nFraud is always a threat to businesses and consumers. According to Avidchange\u2019s B2B Payment Security report, more than three-quarters of businesses have experienced payment fraud in the past year alone.\n\nSpeaking of security, AI is another payment trend to watch. And this can work in businesses\u2019 favor or, in a worst-case scenario, fraudsters\u2019 favor. Globalpayments reports that as many as 43% of businesses have plans to employ AI technology to help with fraud detection.\n\nWhile AI is an amazing tool to detect fraudulent transactions and add a layer of security, it also makes the work of a hacker much more accessible.\n\nRather than manually decoding payment information, hackers can tap into AI technology to make it easier to accomplish their tasks. In fact, Deloitte actually predicts that AI could enable losses to fraud of up to $40 billion by 2027. So, it\u2019s important to use payment technology that integrates the latest and most advanced security features.\n\n4. Instant payments\n\nWhile consumers love the convenience of being able to pay with anything other than cash, this has also added to delays when it comes to being able to access said cash.\n\nDigital payments often come with a waiting period\u2014for example, if I make a purchase with my credit card at a store, it might take a day or two for the charge to show up. Likewise, when I transfer money from PayPal or Venmo to my account, I usually have to wait a few days to receive the funds in my bank account.\n\nThese delays don\u2019t gel with our instant gratification society. So, payment technology is adapting to instant payments. For example, if I want to receive my PayPal or Venmo funds right away, I can actually pay a fee for an instant transfer.\n\nInstant payments are actually expected to make up 22% of transactions by 2028, per Capegemini\u2019s World Payments Report 2025. It\u2019s also believed that more instant payment availability will also facilitate more digital payment adoption by both businesses and consumers alike. JPMorgan reports about 80% of finance professionals believe faster payments will positively impact business.\n\nBut time will tell on this one\u2014only about 5% of global banks have advanced business technology, so there\u2019s still work to do.\n\n5. B2B is going digital\n\nB2B payments used to be largely check-based. But checks are quickly becoming antiquated in the payments industry. In fact, 80% of B2B transactions used to be paid by check\u2014that figure is now closer to one-third. And only about 5% of businesses are even prepared to make vendor and supplier payments by check.\n\nYou can see the decline in cash and check in B2B payment trends in the chart below. In 2019, they made up half of all B2B payments. Now, they account for less than one-third. Digital ACH transfers are making the most headway, but card and wire payments also experienced a slight increase."

            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThe small piece of silver foil was virtually unrolled using CT scanning.\n\nMs Rassalle explained: \"The purpose of these amulets, also known as phylacteries, was to protect or heal their owners from a range of misfortunes, such as illnesses, bodily aches, infertility, or even demonic forces. \"In an era without advanced medical knowledge, such items were vital sources of comfort and security for you and your loved ones.\" She continued: \u201cThese amulets were widely used in Late Antiquity, especially in the eastern Mediterranean world but they are much rarer in the western Roman world. The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

I\u2019ve been seeing this girl \u201cAngie\u201d for eight months now. She is everything to me. I fell in love with her right away, and she said she loved me first within the first month.\n\nBut now, I get yelled at for basically everything I say. Like today, I called her for the first time at 2:30 p.m. and she answered the phone saying, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask what she\u2019s up to and she says, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business\u201d and then goes, \u201cI\u2019m done talking now.\u201d This is a typical conversation for us.\n\nAnnie, I never cheated on this girl. I have always treated her well. Is it cheating if I just quit talking to her and start looking for someone else? The crappy part is that I don\u2019t want anyone else. But I\u2019m not sure how much longer I can put up with this. -- Should I Stay or Should I Go\n\nDear Should I Stay: Before you start looking for someone else, you need to tell Angie the relationship is over. Just because she isn\u2019t treating you well doesn\u2019t mean you should stoop to her level.\n\nAs for not wanting anyone else, you\u2019ll never know until you start looking. You\u2019d be amazed at what a clean break and a little bit of time can do.\n\nDear Annie: I will be inheriting a modest sum of money and want to gift some of it to my two married children. I also want to gift some money to my daughter\u2019s two young children to be used for future educational needs. My son and his wife don\u2019t have children and will likely not have any in the future. They lost beautiful twins born prematurely many years ago.\n\nI want to be fair and compassionate with the distribution of money. If I gift the same amount to my two children and a smaller amount to our two grandchildren, do you think my son will feel the distribution is unfair? I realize the inheritance is mine to do with as I please, but I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. We are all kind and level-headed people. -- Grandma in a Quandary\n\nDear Grandma: Your thoughtfulness and consideration for everyone\u2019s emotions show what a caring grandma you are.\n\nGifting the same amount to each child, plus additional funds earmarked for your grandkids' education, is a perfectly fair approach. But because your son and daughter-in-law experienced such a profound loss, it\u2019s wise to consider how this might affect them emotionally. If you want, you could contribute something unique to them as well -- a trip, for example -- to show extra consideration.\n\nSend your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.\n\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM\n\n"

            "source": "TechRepublic",
            "article_content": "The cyber landscape is more turbulent than ever. Microsoft recently reported a 2.75-fold increase in ransomware attempts this year, while research predicts that global cyber attacks in 2024 will surge 105% compared to 2020.\n\nThere is a dire need for more qualified cyber professionals as generative AI is lowering the barrier to entry for attacks. Unfortunately, cyber skills gaps have been reported in both the U.K. and Australia, with women making up only a quarter of the industry.\n\nBut how will we roll into next year? TechRepublic asked cyber experts to predict the top trends impacting the security field in 2025.\n\nSEE: Number of Active Ransomware Groups Highest on Record\n\n1. Renewed focus on third-party risk management, including the AI software supply chain\n\nThis year, headlines were dominated by the CrowdStrike incident, which disabled about 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide and caused huge disruption to emergency services, airports, law enforcement, and other critical organisations.\n\nSEE: What is CrowdStrike? Everything You Need to Know\n\nHowever, this is far from the first instance of a supply chain attack being put on the public\u2019s radar; the MOVEit attacks from last year may also still be fresh in the mind. Due to the prevalence of these incidents, Forrester analysts predict that governments will ban certain third-party software in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, more companies are using Generative AI to code new software, which could open it up to weaknesses. AI-generated code has been known to cause outages, and security leaders are even considering banning the use of technology in software development.\n\nFor executives, this all illustrates how essential third-party risk management is to operations, leading to a new focus in 2025.\n\nMax Shier, the chief information security officer at cyber advisory firm Optiv, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cThird party risk management, supply chain risk management, and increased oversight and regulatory requirements will drive the need for companies to focus on and mature their governance, risk, and compliance programs.\u201d\n\nJacob Kalvo, the CEO of proxy provider Live Proxies, added: \u201cIt is expected that in 2025, organisations will likely shift toward proactive ways of assessing and monitoring supply chains. It could be leveraging zero-trust architectures that will verify at stages of access, where the companies deal with external partners.\n\n\u201cThis shift to increased supply chain scrutiny marks a wider trend of bringing cybersecurity into general enterprise-wide risk management.\u201d\n\nAI software is one of the weakest links in the software supply chain\n\nWhile businesses race to capitalise on generative AI solutions, the speed of their adoption has resulted in some areas of oversight when it comes to security. A study from HackerOne found that 48% of security professionals believe AI poses the most significant security risk to their organisation.\n\nCache Merrill, founder of software development company Zibtek, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cAs AI tools increasingly integrate into software development, we anticipate attackers targeting the software supply chain\u2019s weakest AI-driven components. The focus will no longer be just on vetting third-party code but scrutinising AI models that may have inadvertently introduced security gaps through data poisoning or bias exploitation.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, supply chain security will demand a whole new layer of vigilance, where even the datasets and AI models feeding into our applications are analysed for adversarial tampering. A secure supply chain won\u2019t just be about code but curating safe and verifiable AI training sources.\u201d\n\nPaul Caiazzo, VP of security services at Quorum Cyber, told TechRepublic that attackers may specifically target weaker AI tools to exfiltrate sensitive data. \u201cCISOs will struggle to secure them due to a lack of AI skills and tooling,\u201d he added.\n\n2. Macs will become more targeted by cybercriminals\n\nExperts say that Macs will become even more of a target for cybercriminals in the next year. Kseniia Yamburh, malware research engineer at Moonlock, the security division of MacPaw, told TechRepublic by email: \u201cOnce considered safer, macOS now faces rising threats, particularly from stealer malware designed to collect sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur research at Moonlock shows a notable spike in macOS-targeted stealer malware, with 2024 seeing 3.4 times more unique samples than 2023.\u201d\n\nSEE: Threat Actors Increasingly Target macOS, Report Finds\n\nThe number of macOS vulnerabilities exploited in 2023 increased by more than 30%, with attackers using infostealers, fake PDFs, fake Mac apps, legitimate Microsoft apps, and other novel techniques to breach the operating system this year. In November, several malicious macOS apps were linked to North Korea.\n\nThe growing interest in Apple devices may be due to their increasing prevalence in organisations and greater competition amongst cybercriminals in the Windows landscape.\n\n3. Identity to shift into the jurisdiction of security teams\n\nSecurity experts predict that in 2025, responsibility for identity and access management within companies will shift from IT departments to security teams. Sagie Dulce, VP of research at segmentation firm Zero Networks, said identity-based attacks are the leading cause of breaches, and this is not looking to change. As these attacks escalate, security professionals are needed to eliminate potential entry points.\n\nDulce told TechRepublic: \u201cThis is not new, but is a growing trend as more identities belong to services and apps \u2014 they are harder to manage and control. Most organisations are currently blind to their exposure from service accounts, privileged identities, secrets spread, third party access, and more.\n\n\u201cThese identities are often the lowest-hanging fruits in organisations and attackers know it. As many web applications are still exposed to the internet, getting initial access via compromised credentials to a web app remains the main attack vector utilised to gain initial access.\u201d\n\n4. Cyber regulations will divide countries\n\nGlobal cyber regulations are becoming stricter \u2014 especially with the rise in nation-state cyber attacks. As a result, legislation will focus on geopolitics and national security interests.\n\nVishal Gupta, CEO of security software provider Seclore, told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cIn the coming year, long raging wars and general geopolitical tensions will drive the bulk of regulations. Countries and groups of countries will create regulations to protect their own interests over deemed enemies and will prevent the broad spread of supply chains.\n\n\u201cThis is already evident in the CHIPS act and more recent [export control law] interpretations. \u2018Country over collaboration\u2019 may well be the theme of these regulations.\u201d\n\nDouglas McKee, executive director of Threat Research at security firm SonicWall, added that it will become increasingly difficult to detect the origins of attacks because \u201cthe line between state and criminal operations will continue to blur further.\u201d\n\nSEE: Tenable: Cyber Security Pros Should Worry About State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks\n\nAs a result, decision-makers should strengthen international collaboration rather than create more division. McKee told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cGovernments and private organisations must adapt to this evolving threat landscape, focusing more on proactive intelligence sharing and threat-hunting to disrupt collaborative efforts before they impact critical sectors.\u201d\n\nCritical national infrastructure will fall behind in compliance\n\nCritical national infrastructure, such as transport, telecommunications companies, and data centres, is a key target for attackers because it can lead to widespread disruption. A recent report from Malwarebytes found that the services industry is the worst affected by ransomware, accounting for almost a quarter of global attacks.\n\nSEE: 80% of Critical National Infrastructure Companies Experienced an Email Security Breach in Last Year\n\nAccording to Christian Borst, EMEA CTO at security firm Vectra AI, attacks on CNI will surge in 2025, partly because these firms are not keeping up with regulations. These include NIS2, which aims to establish a consistent, minimum cybersecurity baseline across all E.U. member states.\n\nBorst told TechRepublic in an email: \u201cRegulators aren\u2019t asking the world, but CNI firms are already struggling to stick to the timelines set out by regulators and get their houses in order, as we\u2019re already seeing E.U. member states who are lagging behind on NIS2 implementation.\n\n\u201cThreat actors will be well aware of lagging compliance, so will concentrate efforts on targeting critical infrastructure before the security gaps are closed.\u201d\n\n5. Specific employees targeted via social media and AI\n\nAt the start of the year, a finance worker in Hong Kong paid out $25 million to hackers that used AI and publicly available video content to impersonate the chief financial officer. The hackers mimicked the executive\u2019s voice during phone calls to authorise the transfer.\n\nExperts predict that this behaviour will continue into 2025. According to Garner, AI-enhanced malicious attacks were the top emerging business risk throughout the year\u2019s first three quarters.\n\nThe number of business email compromise attacks detected by security firm Vipre in the second quarter was 20% higher than the same period in 2023, and two-fifths of them were generated by AI. The top targets were CEOs, followed by HR and IT personnel.\n\nDarius Belejevas, head of data privacy platform Incogni, told TechRepublic: \u201cAn ever-increasing number of data breaches are now the result of criminals actively targeting specific employees, in some cases armed with personal information they have managed to source on that individual. Unfortunately not enough people realise they are being targeted because of where they work.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Listen to article\n\nThis is the time for the yearender. 2024 should be remembered as the year when the future invaded our lives and when we were too busy to care or pay attention. Our choices speak volumes about these trends.\n\nIt was a record election year. Nearly half of the world's population voted this year, and more than half of these elections produced populist outcomes. What explains this? Dissatisfaction with the status quo and the ruling elite? The decline of institutions resulting in the flattening of state superstructures? Murphy's law? Election meddling by hostile actors? A bit of everything, I suppose. But also something else. We shall get back to this \"something else\" in a bit.\n\nYou can laugh at Murphy's law because it is made up half in jest, but it aligns perfectly with the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy is bound to increase. That which can go wrong will go wrong - ergo, a reality of life.\n\nEven the best institutions tend to decline when you introduce an unfair amount of new variables - more population, for instance, or cutting-edge technology competing with your credibility. When institutions decline, the state's superstructure caves in and becomes flat.\n\nThe dissatisfaction with the ageing ruling elite and its refusal to change and adapt to evolving times is a verifiable reality. To hide its inflexibility, privilege, entitlement and occasional incompetence, this elite relies heavily on secrecy, which breeds paranoia and contempt. Paranoia and contempt divert focus from substantive discussions towards theatrics, often empowering charlatans.\n\nThe diffusion of national boundaries due to the explosion of social media is not new. This makes the job of hostile election meddlers easier. Combining all the above factors will invariably get the most volatile mix useful to these bad actors.\n\nBut the \"something else\" we hinted at earlier explains many of these tumultuous developments. My regular readers may remember my piece published in this space in September titled \"Why States Fear Complexity\". In it, I identified two factors reshaping our reality: acceleration and complexity. In that very column, I also quoted Alvin Toffler's Future Shock, defining change as the process by which the future invades our lives. Consider the growing complexity and acceleration in our societies as the future's source of ingress into our lives.\n\nAcceleration is caused by exponential population growth and the breakneck pace of technological innovation. Complexity results from these elements and a myriad of other factors, like climatic decay and the human desire to live in large groups, such as megacities. As I pointed out, no state is equipped to deal with such massive currents of change.\n\nOne example of how complexity blindsided state regulators is the 2008 financial crisis. Watch The Big Short to understand how most regulators were out of their depth regarding instruments like subprime mortgages and credit default swaps. The bankruptcy of FTX is another example. This complexity has only grown over the years, even if real finance has become a figment of our imagination.\n\nWith Trump's outstanding victory, you can already see the shape of things to come. For instance, cryptocurrencies, which you might have written off under a Harris administration, are going from strength to strength. There's even talk of Bitcoin strategic reserves and the creation of a new department in the US named after another cryptocurrency. How this trend will pan out in countries like Pakistan, which refuse to even acknowledge cryptocurrencies, is an open question.\n\nLikewise, we have discussed breakthroughs in AI at length in the past. Even as the US lags behind Europe in laying down a regulatory framework, the advent of Trump's second term makes further progress in regulation highly unlikely.\n\nIn innovation, it is a race to the finish with China. The same can be said of quantum computing. Unlike American companies, China uses lasers for quantum computing. We still have to wait and see which version is more scalable and error-free.\n\nAnother significant development, to my great chagrin, is the gradual but total demise of the mainstream media. Take the examples of India and the US: there is no correlation between punditry and political outcomes.\n\nThe mainstream media seems to have lost all credibility in the face of a twin onslaught from charged social media and AI. These edifices still exist but are marked for demolition. My money is on the early demise of CNN. In our region, where global trends take their sweet time to arrive, media outlets enter zombie mode, going through routine motions while knowing the consumer's attention left the building long ago.\n\nAI innovations are particularly life-threatening to the entertainment business. With text-to-image and animation platforms like OpenAI's Sora and Google's Veo producing photorealistic results, you can understand why many film and TV directors are worried about their jobs. These technologies can whip up complex, multilayered, gripping and nuanced scripts within seconds, and similar software can generate an entire episode or movie within minutes. No big production budgets are needed, and the number of takes is no longer a limiting factor. AI software can even help with distribution.\n\nIn medicine, technology is already producing impressive results: exoskeletons and bioelectric devices for disabled bodies, dual-targeting Alzheimer's drugs, new schizophrenia treatments, advancements in some cancer therapies and an HIV prevention drug with 100% efficacy among African women. According to renowned scientist Michio Kaku, progress in quantum computing could make finding a cure for cancer much easier by enabling countless simulations to run simultaneously at lightning speed.\n\nArthur C Clarke's third law states that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. From here onwards, we will most likely live in magical times. But this magic will primarily benefit the rich. For the poor and working class, job displacement caused by automation will bring suffering. In the short term, the nature of work may change, positioning humans as overseers of AI. If you snooze, you lose - but this is only a transitory phase.\n\nKeep Clarke's third law in mind, and remember the movie Idiocracy, which aptly illustrates the misplaced priorities of mortals who invest in superficial things rather than their own intelligence. Technological advancement is no guarantee of improved intellect. Consequently, you can witness the growth of climate denial, which may seal humanity's fate.\n\nAll this \u2014 from just one year."

But after initially firing a flurry of them, Ukraine has already slowed their use.\n\nKyiv is running out of missiles. It also might be running out of time: President-elect Donald J. Trump has said publicly that allowing U.S.-made long-range missiles inside Russia was a big mistake.\n\nSo far, the missiles have been effective in limited ways, but they have not changed the war\u2019s trajectory, senior NATO officials said.\n\nThe war has also not escalated as some had feared. Although Russia launched a powerful new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile at a Ukrainian weapons facility after the first two volleys of Western long-range missiles, it has since responded to them with its usual mix of drones, missiles and threats."

            "article_content": "realme has brought a remarkable shift to the Nigerian smartphone market since it officially launched in October 2024. The launch was well received by tech enthusiasts who were happy to try out a new brand and Nigerians scouring for affordable smartphones with top-notch quality.\n\nWith a commitment to delivering quality tech at pocket-friendly prices, realme is positioning itself as a formidable contender in the competitive Nigerian smartphone market for 2025. But is that enough to tackle the leading brands in Nigeria?\n\nrealme\u2019s official entry into Nigeria\n\nKnown globally for its value-for-money smartphones, realme debuted in Nigeria with the realme Note 50 and realme C61 in Q4, 2024. The company\u2019s marketing strategy highlighted its focus on young, tech-savvy consumers constantly demanding high-performance devices without straining their finances.\n\nThe realme C61 swears by marketing phrases like \u201cHard to break\u201d and \u201c4 years of lag-free use\u201d, promising a reliable device that\u2019s worth every penny. Its top features include an IP54 rating, a 90Hz display, 256GB storage, 24GB Dynamic RAM, a 5,000mAh battery, and a 50MP camera. By focusing on these core values, realme aims to attract a diverse audience, from tech-savvy youths to budget-conscious consumers. This commitment is particularly relevant in a market where economic factors heavily influence purchasing decisions.\n\nA game-changer for Nigeria\u2019s smartphone market\n\nPopular brands like TECNO, Infinix, and Samsung have long dominated Nigeria\u2019s smartphone market. A 2024 statistic by StatCounter shows that TECNO holds about 24.4% of the market share, followed by Infinix at 22.3% and Samsung at 12.2%. While contending with these brands is no small feat for a newcomer, realme\u2019s strategic entry has the potential to change Nigeria\u2019s smartphone market.\n\nIt\u2019s not new that the country\u2019s fluctuating economy has pumped up smartphone prices by over 86%, making even mid-range devices unattainable for most people. With a new player ready to offer quality tech at cheap prices, Nigerians are open to getting more value for their hard-earned money.\n\nWith what we\u2019ve seen with the realme C61 and Note 50, realme is not offering cheap, poor-performing devices. For instance, the realme C61 offers a sturdy build quality with IP54 dust and water resistance. The device sports a massive 256GB storage, up to 24GB Dynamic RAM and expertly tuned software to match their \u201c4 years of lag-free use\u201d claim.\n\nThat aside, realme\u2019s foray also means increased competition in pricing and quality. The dominating brands will need to innovate further to maintain their market share. This increased competition is a win for Nigerian consumers, who now have access to better devices. And since realme is offering its devices at competitive prices, it has an edge in disrupting Nigeria\u2019s market in 2025.\n\nUsers\u2019 feedback for realme Note 50 and realme C61\n\nEarly user feedback for the realme Note 50 and C61 has been largely positive, reflecting the brand\u2019s alignment with consumer expectations. To separate gimmicks from real marketing, realme\u2019s bold claim of the realme C61 as \u201cHard to break\u201d has aroused many to put it to the test.\n\n@kagan, a top Nigerian tech content creator, shared on Instagram page how the phone remained in pristine condition after trying to damage it in various ways.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/DDLAvfrMX_V/\n\nHe first simulated a casual accident by dropping it from eye level to a tiled floor. He then proceeded by smashing it with a hammer, which resulted in zero damage to the phone. Driving a 3-ton truck on the phone was his next move, but all his efforts proved abortive as the realme C61 remained unbreakable.\n\nBesides the sturdy build quality, many users have praised the realme Note 50 and realme C61 for their sleek design, camera capabilities, performance, long-lasting battery, and software features streamlined for daily activities. All these positive reviews will help attract more customers who may have been disappointed by other brands.\n\nAfter-sales support\n\nrealme\u2019s after-sales support is another aspect that could contribute to its rapid growth in Nigeria. While the brand promises rugged smartphones, most people still cherish the assurance that their phones can be easily repaired.\n\nIn November 2024, realme announced its first official service centre in Lagos to provide quality after-sales services and offer fans exclusive access to their latest devices. With plans to recreate this in other Nigerian states in 2025, realme is projecting itself as a trustworthy brand that Nigerians can bank on.\n\nCan realme reshape Nigeria\u2019s smartphone market in 2025?\n\nrealme\u2019s entry into the Nigerian smartphone market marks a significant milestone for the industry. With its commitment to delivering quality technology at affordable prices, realme is well-positioned to challenge established players and capture a substantial share of the market in 2025.\n\nWhile there are hurdles to overcome, realme\u2019s commitment to keep innovating and meeting consumers\u2019 needs could indeed make it a top contender in the nation\u2019s smartphone market by 2025."

            "article_content": "Phil Ashley/Getty Images\n\nThe TikTok ban could be catastrophic for Americans.\n\nThis crisis has ripple effects that could disrupt industries and shake the American economy. \ud83d\udcb0\n\nAly (my editor) HATES when I do hot takes\u2026 but billions per month are at stake, and American small businesses are on the line so I have to share this one.\n\nAlso: AI isn't the next big thing - here's what is\n\nThousands of creators are scrambling to find alternative platforms, and millions who built their livelihoods on TikTok are at risk of losing their incomes. This ban threatens TikTok employees, creators, influencers, and small businesses throughout the entire ecosystem.\n\nThis ban could also be a massive stumbling block for a major tech company. And it's not who you think. \ud83d\ude2e\n\nI'll drop some insights on what this chaos might mean for long-term Meta investors. (Not financial advice.)\n\nLow key, this TikTok ban is like a soap opera. \ud83c\udf7f\n\nThat said, these views are my own, definitely not ZDNET's, and definitely not Aly's.\n\nQuick Intro\n\nIf you're new to my work, my name is Lester Mapp. My friends call me Les. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nI'm a founder with a successful exit and currently the executive chairman of a group of DTC brands. But at my core, I'm an award-winning performance marketer.\n\nAlso: 3 lucrative side hustles you can start right now with OpenAI's Sora video generator\n\nI've crafted and managed tens of millions in digital marketing campaigns on Meta, TikTok, and Google. \ud83d\ude80\n\nNeedless to say, I have unique insight into what's happening and how this ban will affect small businesses.\n\nBTW, if you're into data-driven marketing insights and strategies, check out my free newsletter, No Fluff Just Facts.\n\nAll that said, let's get into the hot take Aly told me not to do. \ud83d\ude05\n\nLet's recap how we got here\n\nThe TikTok ban is officially called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act and was signed into law by President Biden on April 24, 2024.\n\nByteDance, TikTok's parent company, now has a deadline to sell the app to a US-approved buyer or face a ban. \ud83d\ude24\n\nHere is the recap:\n\nDeadline: ByteDance must sell TikTok by January 24, 2025 (or April 24, 2025, with an extension).\n\nConsequence: If not sold, TikTok will be removed from US app stores and banned.\n\nReason: The law addresses national security concerns over data access and potential influence from the Chinese government.\n\nTikTok saw the new act and said nah and pushed back against it, arguing it violates the First Amendment.\n\nThe irony of a Chinese company arguing for the First Amendment is not lost on me. \ud83d\ude43\n\nOn December 6, 2024, the US Court of Appeals upheld the ban.\n\nAlso: Is this the end of Google? This new AI tool isn't just competing, it's winning\n\nIn response, TikTok said nah again and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court and seek an injunction to delay the ban.\n\nAs of December 13, 2024, the Supreme Court has yet to rule, leaving the outcome uncertain.\n\nIn addition, TikTok creators are suing the Department of Justice, arguing that the ban threatens their livelihoods, communities, and freedom of expression. \ud83d\ude31\n\nTikTok ban could leave a void Meta won't fill\n\nTikTok has become a critical platform for many creators, with some earning over 75% of their income through the app. \ud83d\ude33\n\nMeta doesn't offer the same programs and support geared toward audience growth and creator revenue, so creators on Meta typically earn less money.\n\nFor advertisers, the TikTok ban is less than ideal; in fact, it sucks.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT Search could destroy online businesses - how you can stay ahead\n\nTo understand why, here's a crash course in marketing. Don't worry, I'll keep it as simple as possible.\n\nThere are two main stages of awareness:\n\nIntent: When people know what they want and are actively searching for it. This is called product or problem awareness. I know what my problem is, and I'm looking for a solution. Sometimes, this could be problem and solution-aware. Think of when you use Google Shopping. It doesn't get any easier than this for an advertiser because I don't need to educate you\u2026 you buy, or you leave. Very straightforward.\n\nDiscovery: Picture this: you're scrolling on Meta or TikTok, enjoying the funny stuff on your feed, and boom, you see a very cool widget for a problem you have. With a bit of education, you decide to buy. That's discovery.\n\nDiscovery is key to scaling revenue because it introduces your product or service to people who don't yet know they need it. Meta is king when it comes to discovery, but TikTok is gaining ground quickly.\n\nStay with me; you need to understand this to see the void\u2026 \u23f3\n\nTikTok provides another platform to showcase products to a new audience at scale. While it isn't quite at Meta's level yet, it is getting there.\n\nAlso: What's really destroying your productivity - and 3 simple ways to focus better today\n\nSince TikTok is so effective, running campaigns on both TikTok and Meta together increases overall marketing efficiency for advertisers.\n\nWhat's also never mentioned is that TikTok's rapid growth forces Meta to step up its game for creators and advertisers.\n\nWithout TikTok, I worry Meta will fall back into old habits, ad costs will keep rising, and ad efficiency will drop. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nThe biggest winners\u2026\n\nThe obvious winners are platforms like Google, Meta, Snapchat, and X. \ud83c\udfc6\n\nGoogle is sighing relief as 74% of Gen Z users use TikTok for search, with 51% preferring TikTok over Google as their search engine.\n\nYeah, you read that right; on top of being a social platform, TikTok is also becoming a search engine.\n\nAmazon also stands to benefit.\n\nTikTok Shop has been growing rapidly, and its ability to serve as both a traffic source and a storefront makes it incredibly powerful.\n\nAlso: Drowning in spam? Stop giving out your email address - do this instead\n\nOverall, I believe this ban will be a net positive for the American people.\n\nI know what you are thinking: \"You just said this will cost small businesses billions, plus lead to lost jobs and more.\" And I feel strongly about that.\n\nHowever, no foreign adversary should have this much access to American lives. This data includes spending habits, credit card information, shopping preferences, location data, browsing history, biometric data, and even access to camera rolls and microphones. \ud83d\udd12\n\nLooking at this objectively, we should have never gotten to this point. But that is a rant for another day.\n\nThe biggest loser no one is talking about...\n\nByteDance, creators, and small businesses would bear the brunt of a TikTok ban as court filings from TikTok executives estimate creators and small businesses could lose $1.3 billion in revenue during the first month. \ud83d\udcc9\n\nBut guess who's probably low-key pissed about this?\n\nShopify!\n\nAlso: This pocket camera has fully replaced my iPhone for video shooting\n\nShopify's partnership with TikTok allows merchants to connect their Shopify stores directly to TikTok Shop. It allows business owners to sync their stores, manage ads, access analytics, and use TikTok's shopping features. This seamless integration drives growth for both platforms. \ud83e\udd1d\n\nTikTok's e-commerce goals are ambitious, with a target of $17.5 billion in US sales for 2024. Shopify stands to gain big from that. The partnership gives merchants access to TikTok's massive audience and a new way to drive sales.\n\nTikTok and Shopify are like peanut butter and jelly. One brings the traffic, and the other handles the transactions.\n\nAll I am saying is that Shopify is about to take a hit, and no one is talking about it. \ud83e\udd14\n\nWhat next?\n\nIf you are a creator or small business owner wondering what to do next, I got you.\n\nThe obvious answer is to double down on platforms like YouTube, Meta, X, and others. It's decent advice, but more is needed to solve the real problem.\n\nThe real issue is that we need to own our audience as marketers, business owners, and creators. Whether through email lists, membership sites, or SMS, the goal should be to own the relationship, not rent it.\n\nHere's the hard truth: if it's not this, it will be something else. The next update, the next algorithm change, the next platform shutdown, something will always disrupt the way you reach your audience.\n\nI've been doing this for a long time, and I can't recall a moment when advertising costs went down. Owning your audience is more than just prudent. It's an opportunity to stabilize costs.\n\nThe pattern is clear for 2025: businesses must be media-first to survive and thrive. \ud83d\udce2\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThink about building a community. Think about providing value to your prospects before making an offer. It's about creating content that builds trust, loyalty, and engagement so your audience stays with you, no matter what happens on any platform.\n\nIf you want deeper insights on how to make this work, hit me up on LinkedIn.\n\nMy two cents\n\nAs someone who this ban will impact, I have a mixed bag of emotions. \ud83e\udd74\n\nAs a TikTok Shop operator and advertiser, I wanna cry.\n\nAs a Meta advertiser, I'm not happy and will be closely watching ad costs as this plays out.\n\nAs a Meta investor, I find it interesting that it could boost the share price.\n\nAs a Shopify investor, I'm closely monitoring Q2 2025 earnings if the ban is upheld.\n\nAs an American, I like my privacy private, so I get it.\n\nThat said, in situations like this, I always remember this quote\u2026\n\n\"It's not happening to you. It's happening for you.\" \ud83e\udd17\n\nAs cheesy as it sounds, that saying has served me well during tough times.\n\n\ud83d\ude07 Hope this helps; I'm rooting for you.\n\nP.S. \ud83d\udce9 Want more data-driven marketing insights?

            "article_content": "If your Windows computer freezes and beeps when moving or using the mouse, the solutions provided in this article will help you. According to reports, this problem usually occurs while playing a game or after closing a game. The only way to fix this problem is to force-shut down the computer.\n\nComputer freezes and beeps when moving or using the mouse\n\nIf your Windows 11/10 computer freezes and beeps when moving or using the mouse, use the following fixes:\n\nPreliminary fixes Check the hardware requirements of the game Check the CPU and GPU temperature Test your RAM Check the issue in the Clean Boot state Update your BIOS and chipset driver Decode the beep Reinstall the mouse and GPU driver Take professional help\n\nLet\u2019s see all these fixes in detail.\n\n1] Preliminary fixes\n\nRestart your GPU driver and see if your computer freezes this time. To do this, press the Win + Ctrl + Shift + B keys.\n\nkeys. Connect your mouse to another USB port or use another mouse and see what happens. If you have a wireless or Bluetooth mouse, connect it to your system and check if the beep occurs.\n\nCorrupt system image files can also be the cause of this problem. Use the built-in System File Checker and DISM tools to repair the corrupted system image files.\n\nThe issue may be with the input power supply. Plug in the power cord to another wall socket and check if the issue occurs.\n\n2] Check the hardware requirements of the game\n\nIf the issue occurs while playing a game on your PC, your system might not have the supported hardware for that game. Check the hardware requirements for that game.\n\n3] Check the CPU and GPU temperature\n\nMonitor your CPU and GPU temperatures. High CPU and GPU temperatures can cause a computer to freeze or crash unexpectedly. You can use the built-in Task Manager to monitor the GPU temperature. Or you can install free software to monitor the GPU and CPU temperature.\n\nIf you have not cleaned your computer for a long time, it is time to clean it. Accumulated dust inside the computer acts as a barrier to airflow and increases the computer\u2019s internal temperature.\n\n4] Test your RAM\n\nA faulty RAM can be the cause of this problem. To confirm this, test your RAM by using the built-in tool, Windows Memory Diagnostic. If you find your RAM faulty, replace it.\n\n5] Check the issue in the Clean Boot state\n\nStart your computer in a Clean Boot state and check if the issue occurs. This will let you know whether the problem is occurring due to a conflicting third-party background application or service. If the issue does not appear in the Clean Boot state, the next step is to identify the culprit application or service. For this, enable some of the startup applications and restart your system. If the issue reappears, one of the applications you enabled is the culprit. You can repeat the same process to identify the culprit third-party service.\n\n6] Update your BIOS and chipset driver\n\nCheck if the latest BIOS update is available for your computer. If yes, download and install the update. You can download the latest BIOS firmware from your computer manufacturer\u2019s official website.\n\nAlso, download the latest version of the chipset driver from your computer manufacturer\u2019s official website and install it. Alternatively, you can use dedicated software, such as AMD Software Adrenalin Edition, to update the chipset driver for computers with AMD chipsets.\n\n7] Decode the beep\n\nYour computer is making a beep sound, which can indicate a hardware fault. Different brands of motherboards have different beep codes. Visit your motherboard manufacturer\u2019s official website and download your computer motherboard\u2019s user manual. You will find the meaning of beep codes there.\n\n8] Reinstall the mouse and GPU driver\n\nTry to reinstall the mouse driver and see if it helps. Use the Device Manager for the same. The following steps will help you with that:\n\nOpen the Device Manager. Expand the Mice and other pointing devices branch. Right-click on your mouse driver and select Uninstall device. Now, restart your PC or scan for hardware changes.\n\nPerform a clean installation of your graphics card driver. Download the latest version of your graphics card driver from your computer manufacturer\u2019s official website. Now, download and install the DDU utility. Boot in Safe Mode and use the DDU tool to completely remove your graphics card driver. Now, run the installer file to reinstall your GPU driver.\n\n9] Take professional help\n\nThere may be a hardware fault with your system. Take professional help to address this issue.\n\nWhy is my PC beeping when I move the mouse?\n\nThere can be many reasons why your PC beeps when you move the mouse. Your mouse or the USB port may be faulty. You can check this by connecting a wireless mouse. The problem may also be with the power supply or another hardware component.\n\nHow to stop a computer from beeping?\n\nA beep code indicates a hardware fault. Every motherboard has different meanings for different beep codes. You can get the meanings of beep codes on the official website of your computer manufacturer or in your motherboard user manual.\n\nRead next: VGA light on motherboard is ON."

Which means that the exact circumstances around her death have remained a mystery for almost three decades.\n\nHowever, this may all be about to change as John Bennett Ramsey, now 81, has now revealed that DNA evidence could finally solve the mystery.\n\nAdvert\n\nSpeaking about the update in an interview with The US Sun, Ramsey revealed that he is set to speak with chief of Boulder Police Stephen Redfearn in January and is hoping that chief of Boulder Police Stephen Redfearn will involve the FBI on finally cracking the case.\n\n\"We have been asking and praying for this over the past 28 years,\" he explained.\n\n\"We are encouraged that the police will finally use the FBI's skills and resources to help solve our case.\"\n\nJonBen\u00e9t's father is hoping her case will finally be solved (CBS News)\n\nAdvert\n\nDNA found at the scene was previously tested and returned a match for an unidentified male, with the discovery ruling out John, his wife Patsy, and their son Burke as suspects in 2008 after years of speculation.\n\nThe DNA had been recovered from underneath JonBen\u00e9t's fingernails, in her underwear, from the garrotte, and the blanket which had been used to hide her body.\n\nExplaining how advancements in DNA sampling could lead to the breakthrough needed, John added: \"Suppose they now use cutting-edge DNA labs to develop a DNA profile in the proper format for familial genealogy research.\n\n\"In that case, we have pretty good odds of finding the killer's identity.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Ramsey family: Patsy, JonBen\u00e9t, Burke, and John (Netflix)\n\nThe father also spoke about how he hopes Netflix's recent docuseries Cold Case: Who Killed JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey will help keep the case fresh in peoples' minds.\n\n\"The reason I've done these media interviews - Netflix, the documentary - is to keep pressure on the police,\" John said.\n\n\"We're not going to go away, folks.\""

            "article_content": "Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump carries a pair of his new signature shoes before taking the stage at Sneaker Con at the Philadelphia Convention Center on February 17, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nCampaign catchphrases aside, we can probably all agree that this was a very weird year in politics, particularly in Pennsylvania, the swingiest of swing states. Before we look ahead to 2025 let\u2019s review the ways Pennsylvania\u2019s politics and politicians got a little (or a lot) weird in 2024.\n\nAs unlikely as it may seem, President-elect Donald Trump did, in fact, take the stage at Sneaker Con in Philly back in February to unveil an official sneaker: gold high-tops with American flag logos, available for pre-order at $399 (limit three pairs per customer). Reporter John Cole had to convince his editor it wasn\u2019t a social media joke, and ended up with a front row seat despite little advance notice from the campaign about where and how to catch Trump\u2019s appearance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump admitted the sneakerhead crowd was \u201ca slightly different audience than I\u2019m used to,\u201d but also said launching the shoe line was something he had wanted to do for \u201ca long time.\u201d He did not wear the shoes on stage. And further proving that politics make strange bedfellows, we discovered that according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the president of Sneaker Con made donations to Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign and a Trump-affiliated PAC, although in relatively small amounts.\n\nDuring a budget hearing in February, the head of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) talked about the agency tracking UFO sightings, to the surprise of committee chairperson Jordan Harris. It took a while to receive them, but senior reporter Peter Hall sought records on the sightings, which showed PEMA investigated more than a dozen incidents over the past decade.\n\nThe sightings included mysterious lights following a motorist on a dark country road, a saucer-shaped craft hovering over a suburban subdivision, and a flaming orb falling into the woods, the records show. Many of the incidents are reported to Stan Gordon, a Westmoreland County resident who operates a 24-hour UFO, bigfoot and cryptid reporting hotline, who said the line has \u201cnever stopped ringing\u201d since the Kecksburg UFO incident of 1965.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always taken these cases very open mindedly,\u201d Gordon told the Capital-Star \u201cWe approach them scientifically.\u201d\n\nMold in a government office does not seem like the kind of situation that would require a whistleblower, but here we are. A staffer at Rep. Eric Davanzo\u2019s (R-Westmoreland) district office in West Newton complained of foul odors, and bought tests to check for the presence of mold. That didn\u2019t go over too well when the tests came back positive, and she was later fired. She sued for wrongful termination and the Commonwealth Court ruled she could move forward with a whistleblower lawsuit.\n\nFirst things first: If you want to try to modify the weather in Pennsylvania, you need a license \u2014 but since the law took effect in 1967 no one has applied for one (we asked).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin), former GOP nominee for governor, claims that new technology and a proliferation of weather modification patents \u201cowned by a combination of Federal Government Agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations, and large multinational corporations\u201d have brought forward the need to update Pennsylvania\u2019s law. He wrote a memo seeking co-sponsor for legislation he intends to introduce.\n\nThe legislation would ban the release of substances within the borders of Pennsylvania to affect the temperature, weather or intensity of sunlight, and appears to be rooted in the false belief that condensation trails left by high flying aircraft are actually trails of chemicals \u2014 aka chemtrails \u2014 released by the government for nefarious reasons, that has become conflated with techniques being explored to reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the atmosphere.\n\nIt\u2019s not often you get the opportunity to write a story with so much potential to use the phrase \u201cred wave.\u201d Alas, it only occurred to our headline writer much later (which, truly, is probably for the best). In June, Rep. Stephanie Borowicz (R-Clinton) objected to a bill to create a grant program that would make pads and tampons free for public school students. She didn\u2019t like that the bill\u2019s cosponsorship memo referred to menstruating women as \u201cpeople,\u201d and claimed the bill was \u201cjust another step by the governor and Democrats to have government provide everything for you, which leads to communism.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s prime sponsors, Rep. Darisha Parker (D-Philadelphia), said the bill would serve to \u201crestore the dignity to these women and girls who have gone unsupported far too long.\u201d\n\nThe bill passed the House by a vote of 117 to 85. It did not advance in the Senate."

            "article_content": "Scientists discovered a wafer-thin rolled up inscription inside the amulet.\n\nAn extraordinary archaeological discovery in Germany has shed new light on the early spread of Christianity in the Roman Empire - as it is being tipped to rewrite history in the process. Researchers have been studying a 1,800-year-old silver amulet first discovered beneath a skeleton's chin in a cemetery outside Frankfurt. The amulet, measuring just 1.4 inches (3.5 centimetres) in length, was carefully examined using cutting-edge CT scanning technology, which revealed a tiny scroll inside the silver. Upon digitally unrolling it, researchers found an unusual Latin inscription, offering a rare glimpse into the Christian beliefs of the time. According to the study\u2019s findings, this discovery could drastically alter the historical timeline of Christianity\u2019s spread across Europe.\n\nTine Rassalle, an independent biblical archaeologist who was not involved in the study, told the LiveScience website: \"This takes our understanding of Western Christianisation and Christian monotheism to a whole new level.\n\nA silver amulet was found near the chin of a man buried in Frankfurt in the third century.\n\n\"What makes this particular example remarkable is that it is written entirely in Latin and exclusively invokes Jesus Christ and the Christian God.\" The amulet was found in the grave of a man who probably died between AD 230 and 270, suggesting that the wearer was a devout Christian at a time when practising the faith openly could be dangerous. Christianity, which was still in its early stages in the Roman Empire, was often persecuted, especially during the reign of Emperor Nero, who infamously targeted Christians in the first century. Researchers say that this man\u2019s burial with the amulet is a likely indication of the depth of his commitment to Christianity. In an era where medical knowledge was limited, amulets like this one were widely thought to offer protection from misfortune, illness, and even demonic forces.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The discovery of this amulet in Germany suggests that Christian ideas had already begun to penetrate areas far from Christianity\u2019s early centres of growth.\u201d Found in 2018 during an excavation of a Roman-era cemetery, the amulet was not the only item uncovered.\n\nTrending"

            "article_content": "I.\n\nOnly the future of the workers' movement will decide the fate of the May 1968 movement. What it was will only be revealed when the last word is said on socialism. Seeking the objective meaning of the May days is a futile enterprise and betrays in those who indulge in it a contemplative curiosity without the slightest grasp on reality. But we can try right now to give meaning to what was, since we know what the future should be. The secret of historical necessity eludes us. Only the past was necessary, but its necessity does not commit the future in an absolute manner. Socialism will only be a historical necessity when history has allowed its realization. Socialism as we imagine it \u2014 imagining socialism being for us a permanent task \u2014 falls within the realm of the possible and the subjective; it is above all a matter of conscience and only secondarily a matter of science. The past belongs to science, the future to conscience. It is not enough to know a lot to move towards socialism, but we will not get there without having previously and consciously imagined and wanted it. Socialism is Utopia as a creative project made of science and ideal, of knowledge and will.\n\nThis is the meaning we give to the movement we have just experienced. We derive it as much from the attitude of the students and workers as from the literary manifestations to which the first gave rise. The paving stone and the sentence have the meaning we give them, and this meaning will only be true when the revolution is made. We choose the meaning of the movement as we choose the revolution. The truth of this choice is only a postulate as long as the demonstration is not provided by history.\n\nII.\n\nDid the debauchery of literature provoked by the events of May help the workers and students in revolt to better understand the meaning of their struggle? One can doubt it. In addition to the proliferation of sectarian phraseology of politically engaged young people, who are therefore little inclined to rethink the situation based on a new experience, one could read learned analyses whose authors, without even questioning their own role in the future of the society targeted by the \"protest\", did not wait for events to settle down to rationalize and prophesy to one another. The most improbable analogies and historical evocations took the place of reflection on the disarray of minds and the impotence of gestures on the one hand, and on the fundamental project on the other. Because if today resembles yesterday, it is above all because past and present are linked by the same defeat. The veneration of failure has taken the form of a cult; worker heroism seems all the more glorious when it results in the triumph of the enemy. Nothing is more masochistic than the historiography of the workers' movement. Thus, the greatest defeat suffered by the modern proletariat is considered universally \u2014 and often by the victims themselves \u2014 as the greatest victory: the Russian revolution of 1917 is considered to be \"proletarian\" and \"socialist\", when it only allowed the creation of a modern proletariat in a State whose institutions all express the negation of socialism, whatever it may be, utopian or scientific . In this respect, it can be said that the ignorance and unconsciousness of the left-wing intelligentsia are equal to its bad faith. There is no worse enemy of the proletariat and of socialism than the left-wing intellectual who agrees to be an accomplice in the greatest mystification of the century: Soviet socialism.\n\nIII.\n\nThe convergence of the student and workers' movements contains the secret of the revolutionary struggles to come; at the same time, it prefigures the essential tendency of the future social transformation.\n\nLinked to a revolutionary goal, the general strike becomes the supreme weapon of the modern proletariat; it reveals the real power of the producers who, at any moment, can stop, or even destroy, the apparatus of production that dominates and oppresses them. The occupation of workplaces symbolizes the future mode of appropriation of productive goods on behalf of society. In France, before the First World War, the theory and practice of the general strike found fertile ground in revolutionary syndicalism, which is the finest lesson that the international workers' movement could give itself in terms of self-emancipation. More than ever, the work of Georges Sorel should be brought out of oblivion and discussed. For it is no coincidence that this thinker was the first in the West to recognize the deep affinities between revolutionary syndicalism and the soviet movement. And his presence will not be superfluous when the New Utopia takes stock of the spiritual heritage that the council movement will inherit. There is here a set of historical and intellectual elements which constitute an inexhaustible source from which the theory of council socialism will draw. But Sorel\u2014no more than Marx\u2014should not be accepted in the totality of his thought. The New Utopia will be made of theory and imagination, calculation and invention, old and new; it will not attach itself to any authority, to any name, to any genius other than that of the anonymous masses who, by inspiring the thinkers of the revolution, allowed them to say and paint their dreams.\n\nIn May 1968, students, through their gestures of total protest \u2014 although ineffective in the last resort \u2014 communicated to workers that spirit of refusal which is the first condition of revolutionary struggle. The student revolt \u2014 which threw disarray into the minds of professional thinkers on the lookout for historical models \u2014 had nothing comparable to an event such as the Commune of 1871. There was not and could not be a \"student Commune\", but nostalgia for the glorious past was enough to plunge certain minds into revolutionary mythology. The simultaneity of the action unleashed in the universities and in the factories is in itself full of lessons; It revealed that the workers' movement has no truth except as a total fact, both material and spiritual: the paving stone in the student's hand represented, rather than expressed, the negation of the established order, while the occupation of the factory and the office concretized, if only temporarily, the expropriation of the propertied class and the challenge to the authority of the employers and to state power. What the workers did, the students thought; emanating from two separate movements, action and idea went hand in hand to ultimately lead to failure. And this was all the more fatal because the revolutionary finality, instinctively felt by the worker, only presented itself in the consciousness of the students in a confused and contradictory way: Marxism \u2014 especially in its Leninist disguise \u2014 was, in the days of May, the ideological factor which sterilized rather than fertilized the revolutionary awareness among the workers and students.\n\nAlthough mostly negative, the lesson of May is of capital importance for the future of the movement: council socialism will either be realized as a utopia or it will not be realized. The New Utopia, conceived by the student, must, in order to become a reality, enter the consciousness and imagination of the worker.\n\nIV.\n\nMarx did not abolish utopia; on the contrary, he renewed its meaning by broadening its sphere of application. For him, utopia becomes a single process in two stages: revolution and creation. Before him, the utopians imagined and thought of creation independently of the men by whom the new city was to be built; at most, they counted on an elite. Marx saw men first; in this sense, he is the most utopian of utopians: little concerned with the future society, he is concerned only with the destruction of the present society and with the consciousness of the class that elevates revolution to the rank of a total requirement. If Marx refused to offer \"recipes for the pots of the future\", it is because his goal was more radical, more utopian in a sense, than that of his precursors: he wanted the end of prehistory, the advent of human society, the birth of man to be the work of \"the most numerous and most deprived class\" and not that of an inspired revolutionary minority. Having made his own the goal of the utopians, he preferred to consider the means of achieving it instead of repeating the criticisms and descriptions of his masters. The utopia of the revolution becomes with him an ethics of revolutionary behavior, an ethics that he wanted to base on a theory of history. Such is the meaning of this \"new materialism\", in other words of this \"materialist sociology\" that he summarized in a few lines in the Foreword to The Critique of Political Economy (1859). Engels and, after him, the whole school, obscured the problem by opposing science and utopia. Marx wanted to support, demonstrate, utopia by science in order to reconcile the two. Science does not engage action, its domain is abstraction and not practice which is application; its only aim is to demonstrate its possibilities and limits; on the other hand, utopia gives meaning to action and proposes ends to be achieved, but its practical solutions have proven ephemeral. Thus, certain utopians (Cabet, Owen) go so far as to create models in the hope of seeing their example imitated. Marx will reject these illusory solutions but will keep the fixed ends by expressing them using a more abstract terminology \u2014 classless society, without State, without money, dictatorship of the proletariat, integral man.\n\nV.\n\nThe chances of council socialism are linked to the workers' awareness, not of any social theory (Marxist or not), but of a system of values, let's say of an ethic. The students in revolt do not all adhere to a doctrine and those who claim to be Marxists are divided into several tendencies which never cease to fight each other. And yet, recent events have shown that a common attitude could be adopted by politically divided students and workers, but united in the negation and refusal of a social order considered and felt to be harmful. Bourgeois morality erects the alienation of man as a universal norm; so-called communist morality rivals bourgeois morality in respecting these same values \u200b\u200bthat bourgeois and communists mutually accuse each other of \"betraying\". And the world is perishing under the threat that this escalation poses to it. Man is sacrificed to bourgeois and communist \"humanism\". The two moralities differ only in the degree of hypocrisy and imposture that each of them manifests in its proclamations of virtue and humanity.\n\nThis is what the student revolt was directed against, thus giving full meaning to the virtually insurrectional strike of the workers. Instinct and spontaneity predominated in both camps, and yet it was the same fundamental call that graffiti, posters, and drawings clearly translated, announcing the reign of the New Utopia. The immense critical force, long contained or stifled, of socialism, anarchy, and revolutionary syndicalism had just exploded: spreading to all minds, it was immediately a firework display of subversive ideas that burst into the press and tracts, to finally degenerate into literature.\n\nIt is possible that the fight will resume, in France and elsewhere, in the East as in the West. But for future struggles to become something other than material for literature, other than a new chapter in the history of the glorious defeats of the working class, we should ask ourselves less about the causes of these permanent failures than we should try to define the objectives to be achieved and the means to be employed; in short, we should imagine the New Utopia.\n\nVI.\n\nOne can conceive, as a first step, of the constitution of an international movement for council socialism which would set itself the initial task of proclaiming its charter of values. This movement could be constituted openly in countries of \"formal\" democracy \u2014 where freedom of expression and association are respected as much as the freedom to exploit the labor force \u2014 and secretly in countries decreed socialist by the grace of state power \u2014 where free criticism, guaranteed by the constitution, can lead and often leads to the loss of physical freedom, of the right of habeas corpus . For, the height of mystification, we have come quite naturally to denounce the enslavement of man by capital, under the bourgeois regime, while we accept, without the slightest criticism, the total submission of man to state power in countries where it is no longer private capital which is the master. The new movement will have to face this dilemma: either to note that the division of the world into capitalist countries and socialist countries is a poor myth systematically maintained by the two systems of exploitation and domination; it will then have to imagine, from this observation, the New Utopia; or to accept this false division which leads to the acceptance of a war of total destruction, thus forcing one to abandon oneself to fate. It is better to consider that everything still remains to be built than to see socialism where it does not exist.\n\nVII.\n\nThe charter of values \u200b\u200bof council socialism will be critical and ethical. As a critique of current modes of social domination, it will be the condemnation of all established regimes, whether liberal or totalitarian, capitalist or pseudo-socialist. As an ethic, it will constitute itself the heir to the spiritual heritage bequeathed by socialist thinkers of all times and all places. Whether they are utopian or scientific. The thought of socialism is in no way the prerogative of those who have claimed it and who, today, claim to adhere to it. It predates the schools and professions of faith openly proclaimed socialist. It is present, implicitly or explicitly, in all schools of wisdom since Greco-Latin and Eastern antiquity, it survives in the religious heresies of the Middle Ages and Modern Times, it takes a concrete form in the imaginations of the utopians; and as for the writings of the so-called \"scientific\" socialists \u2014 starting with the \"founding fathers\" \u2014 they are steeped in a spirit of egalitarian ethics, which also predates its translation into terms of theory . One will search in vain for a more utopian, and therefore more ethical, vision of a communist society than that set out in the most famous charter of so-called scientific socialism: \"The old bourgeois society, with its classes and class conflicts, gives way to an association where the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all\". (The Communist Manifesto)\n\nVIII.\n\nThe movement of workers' councils must be prepared in the minds before being externalized in revolutionary actions, the most decisive of which will be the insurrectional and managerial strike, conceived as the supreme violence by the very fact that it will disarm the class enemy and reduce it to impotence. The entire strategy of non-violence finds its triumphant expression in this strike. Thus can be realized the imperative that Georges Sorel defined as the necessity of \"preserving the revolution's character of absolute and irreformable transformation\" which gives socialism \"its high educational value\" (Reflections on Violence, p. 238). The preparation of minds is an integral part of revolutionary action. By constituting themselves in councils, the workers enter into the first phase of an action which includes several, before and after the outbreak of the general insurrectional strike, the decisive stage being that of the passage to the execution of the management plan. What the unions and the workers' parties have been unable to achieve, the workers' councils make their essential task: to be the schools of socialism first, and the organs of management of the socialist economy next .\n\nThe constitution of workers' councils as schools of socialism and embryos of the future workers' power inaugurates the revolutionary process; it is the best guarantee of the success of a movement which will be that of the \"most numerous and most miserable class\", that of the alienated producers conscious of their alienation and given themselves the mission of realizing their own emancipation and working for the liberation of humanity. No vanguard, no general staff, no elite, however immense the political genius of the leaders who guide them, can substitute themselves for the entire working class in the accomplishment of this emancipatory task. The old structures of the workers' movement were in the image of bourgeois society. The unions and workers' parties, while publicly displaying a revolutionary aim, were, by their very nature, linked to the institutions of the society which they aimed to transform. Caught in their own game, they ended up ensuring the continuity of the social system which they claimed to overthrow. From a moral point of view, their modes of action could not appear otherwise than as a permanent \"betrayal\"; but if appearances show the \"immorality\" of the unions and workers' parties, the sociological analysis of the mechanism of the system obliges us to recognize the fatal character of this betrayal and this immorality. In fact, parties and unions expressed the will of a non-revolutionary class, always ready to bargain its labor power and its freedom at the best price. Depending on the circumstances, this bargaining could bring more or less immediate advantages to the combatants, but the stakes of the fight did not endanger the existence of the exploiting class and the State.\n\nWhat the classical organisations of the working class could not achieve in the past and probably will not succeed in achieving in the future, the new movement has the best chance of accomplishing: it is, to use the words of Rosa Luxemburg (who was then thinking of workers' parties), the very movement of the working class. By constituting themselves in councils, the workers take their destiny into their own hands and undertake that historic initiative which the Communist Manifesto makes the condition of their triumph.\n\nIX.\n\nWorkers' councils are the form of organization that is most capable of promoting, in the living conditions of mass society, the actions of self-emancipation on which the success of the movement depends. A gathering of individuals who are conscious of themselves and convinced of the revolutionary purpose of their struggle, the council is both an end and a means, in contrast to the union and the party which maneuver the anonymous mass of their members to make them serve ends foreign to, or even opposed to, the class they are supposed to represent. By its reduced dimensions, the council can escape anonymity and the alienation of its power. The individual can remain himself there, and if he changes himself, it is under the direct influence of those he rubs shoulders with and whom he changes in turn. Self-education is inseparable from common education, each member bringing to the council \u2014 which is a microcosm of reflection and creation \u2014 his individual gifts and generosity, so that each one enriches himself by spending himself: before becoming the constitutive cell of the new society, the council prefigures it in the behavior of its members.\n\nThis anticipation will only seem chimerical to those who are unaware of the history of acts and gestures of self-emancipation, less visible and less graspable than the loudly reported highlights of the workers' epic that marked the workers' movement from its beginnings to recent years. The history of these manifestations of the workers' movement, while still little known, nonetheless offers a great wealth of constituent elements for imagining and building the New Utopia that a dying world calls for. The universal crisis of which we are today witnesses and victims makes the return to Utopia appear as the only rational outcome left to a humanity threatened with extinction. The supposed realism of the men who govern humanity is only the insane expression of this agony and this threat. Statesmen, whatever their \"greatness\", are, by their state of mind, contemporaries of the troglodytes. In the East as in the West the same madness reigns; only the degree and the form vary.\n\nIt is against this universal reign of insane stupidity that students and workers rose up in France and elsewhere: they were not always aware of it, but such was the profound meaning of their gesture, and it is this hidden meaning of their action which transforms the failure\n\nin success. Others have understood it better than them and, among them, the supporters of the regime have had to throw off the mask. They suddenly had the vision of the end of the world, of the world that was theirs. They know that from now on the path is traced for the revolution that was looking for itself; they know that the stakes are total. They are preparing themselves for an existence of troglodytes, in harmony with their conscience. If they fail, the revolution will have saved them in spite of themselves. Because from now on the revolutionary finality coincides with the biological finality tout court, and the revolution has become the categorical imperative for any man who wants to survive and avoid sinking into a pre-human existence.\n\nX.\n\nIf we persist in giving the word \"utopia\" the meaning of unreal and unrealizable, the reform projects proposed by the ruling classes and political masters of the contemporary world are more utopian, and therefore more unreal and unrealizable, than the models of society imagined from Plato to Wells. All these thinkers have sensed and foreseen the catastrophic course of a historical development given over to the instinct of domination of the possessing classes and of deranged individuals ready to sacrifice the salvation of the species to their thirst for power. Karl Marx, who had the genius to express the most utopian vision in terms of science, once spoke to English proletarians about the threat that a humanity that has reached the height of its technical inventions will have to face. His speech was therefore addressed to us, who have survived two world wars, Nazism, fascism and Stalinism, and who see preparing in bloody preludes a probably fatal confrontation between two worlds that are of the same essence, since the political systems that govern them represent, in different disguises, the same absolute disdain for the mass man, for the average individual subjected to the most misleading political, philosophical and religious propaganda. That Marx chose an audience of workers to deliver the apocalyptic remarks that we are about to read will only surprise those who, Marxists or not, have never understood that, through the mouth of the author of Capital, is expressed just as much the spiritual, therefore absolute, message of the workers' movement and socialism as the scientific, therefore relative, truth of a thinker of genius:\n\n\"There is a striking fact which characterizes our century, a fact which no political party would dare to contest. On the one hand we have seen the birth of industrial and scientific forces which could not have been imagined at any previous period of human history. On the other hand we perceive the symptoms of a catastrophe such as will eclipse even the famous horrors of the end of the Roman Empire. In our day, everything seems pregnant with its opposite. The machine has the marvelous power of shortening work and making it more productive; we see it starving and overworking the workers. By some strange evil spell of fate, the new sources of wealth are transformed into sources of distress. The victories of technology seem to be obtained at the price of moral decay. As humanity becomes master of nature, man seems to become a slave to his fellow men or to his own infamy. It seems as if even the pure light of science needs, in order to shine, the darkness of ignorance and that all our inventions and all our progress have only one aim: to endow material forces with life and intelligence and to reduce human life to a material force. This contrast of modern industry and science on the one hand, with modern misery and dissolution on the other; This antagonism between the productive forces and the social relations of our time is a fact of overwhelming evidence that no one would dare deny. Some parties may deplore it; others may wish to be delivered from modern technology and therefore from modern conflicts. Or again, they may believe that such remarkable progress in the industrial domain requires, in order to be perfect, a no less marked decline in the political order. As for us, we are not fooled by the perfidious spirit that never tires of pointing out all these contradictions to us. We know that the new forces of society demand new men who master them and make them do good work. These new men are the workers. They are, just like the machines themselves, the invention of Modern Times. In the signs that disconcert the bourgeoisie, the aristocracy and the poor harbingers of decline, we recognize our noble friend, the old mole who knows how to work so quickly underground, the worthy pioneer: the Revolution. The English workers are the first-born of modern industry. They will certainly not be the last to come to the aid of the social revolution produced by that industry, a revolution which means the emancipation of their own class throughout the earth, an emancipation as universal as the rule of capital and wage slavery.\"\n\nMan the victim of his own \"infamy\", the industrial worker the \"invention\" of modern times, the revolutionary initiative reserved for the oldest and most evolved proletariat... these are affirmations which must always be meditated upon and recalled to those disciples who have the superstition of personal incarnations and imagine that the revolutionary action of certain individuals brought to the forefront of history is identified with the revolution itself, that is to say with the proletarian revolution as understood in Marx's discourse. The actions of Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mao \u2014 names that appear or disappear according to the whims of history and those who write it \u2014 aimed only to produce, by means of state power (not without reason called \"workers'\"), enormous proletarian masses, living machines, taxable and subject to forced labor at will, which every economic system needs to pass from a primitive stage to a higher stage of capital accumulation.\n\nWith their political omnipotence, these masters of the state apparatus have succeeded in making the idea that socialism is the reign of the planning state of exploitation and of the Party as guardian of ideological purity universally triumph; they have even succeeded in having accepted as \"socialist\" the return to the methods of feudal exploitation and the medieval Inquisition .\n\nThus, we feel less stupor at the Czechoslovak \"affair\" \u2014 which is part of the normal chain of political-military gestures of Soviet imperialism \u2014 than disgust at the stupidity and ignorance displayed, on this occasion, by the specialists of \"socialist\" knowledge. Our position is very simple: if we understand that the \"socialist system\" of the USSR is an immense enterprise of oppression and mystification, and therefore the negation of all the human values \u200b\u200bthat constitute socialist ethics (from Godwin to Marx and beyond), the coup de force that has just been perpetrated is added to the already old list of crimes of the Russian power, at the top of which is the \"affair\" of Kronstadt. Once it is understood that socialism does not exist anywhere in the world today, everything becomes blindingly clear and there is no longer any need to wonder at length about the motives of Russian action in Czechoslovakia, just as there was nothing surprising in the crushing of the Budapest Commune in 1956. On the other hand, the moral defeat inflicted on Soviet imperialism by the passive resistance of an entire population will remain the great lesson of the events, whatever their outcome.\n\nToday, only one problem must be posed and discussed: that of socialism, which is still only a utopian issue, and which will remain so as long as there are states and wage earners, police forces and armies, churches and ideologies.\n\nXI.\n\nWe started from the idea that the \"objective\" meaning of the May movement will only be revealed by the outcome of the future battles of labor against capital and the State. This outcome will depend on the spirit and the will that will animate the struggle of workers and students, now united in the same total demand. Future salaried worker, the student revolted against his future condition as a slave of capital and the State, and it is through this anticipation that he immediately joined the workers' struggle. It is in the student that the spirit that deserted the union and political leaderships, accomplices of capital and the State, was embodied.\n\nThese are the symptoms that we, the partisans of council socialism, detect in the events that are taking place today in many parts of the world and which have taken on an unsuspected magnitude. It remains to define the strategy of the struggle of the new movement. It is up to the workers' councils and the student councils to elaborate their plans of struggle and the objectives to be achieved in each of the stages of the general movement. Having undertaken for several years, although with modest means, to propagate the thought of council socialism, we were less surprised to see the slogan of \"workers' councils\" appearing for the first time in France, on walls and in tracts. Not that we attribute an exaggerated importance to an influence that could only be very limited, but we consider ourselves as the heirs of a revolutionary tradition which, for having had a quasi-esoteric character for a long time, has maintained itself and strengthened itself in the shadow of the official movement. May 1968 will have helped to awaken, in action, a thought which must henceforth take root in the consciousness of all those who campaign for the realization of the New Utopia."

            "article_content": "With the National Deep Tech Startup Policy anticipated to turn operational in 2025, deep-tech companies, especially new-generation firms, are expected to help India strengthen its position as an emerging global player in areas like artificial intelligence (AI), green hydrogen, space tech, biotech, etc. in the coming months and years.\n\nIn a just-released report \"India\u2019s Deep Tech Revolution\", Speciale Invest, a seed-stage venture capital fund specialising in deep technologies and Oister Global, an alternative fund investment entity, have captured the consistent and growing interest in India\u2019s deep tech firms to suggest that 2025 could only prove better. \u201cThe average size of Indian deep tech seed deals has consistently increased in the past eight years\u201d, the report notes adding that in terms of growth percentage, India has seen a 5.3x times growth in the size of seed funding than the global average of 3.6x times during this period.\n\nAccording to the report, a combination of government support, academic partnerships, and private investment is what is shaping India\u2019s deep tech landscape. \u201cThe Indian government has introduced key initiatives like the National Deep Tech Startup Policy and financial support programmes the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council, which are fostering innovation. Premier academic institutions such as the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) play a pivotal role in translating research into commercialised technologies, further accelerating the deep tech revolution. Together, these components are nurturing a new wave of entrepreneurs committed to solving global challenges\u201d, the report said. It also notes that private capital is increasingly recognising the potential of deep tech and there has been a marked rise in seed-stage and early-stage investments, with corporates recognising the value of collaborating with deep tech startups. \u201cCorporate capital has been flowing into the sector, especially in industries such as energy, healthcare, and manufacturing. This influx of investment is positioning India\u2019s deep tech sector to compete globally, leveraging its technological expertise and skilled workforce\u201d, the report said.\n\n\u201cIndia's deep tech sector is at a defining moment. With cutting-edge innovations across fields like space technology, AI, and green hydrogen, India has the potential to not only transform its economy but also become a global leader in science and engineering-driven solutions. As we continue to invest in and support pioneering startups, we witness firsthand the country\u2019s capacity to solve some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges. The future is here, and India is poised to lead the charge\u201d. Vishesh Rajaram, Managing Partner at Speciale Invest said.\n\nIncidentally, the investors\u2019 optimism is shared by CS Murali, Chairman of the Entrepreneurship Cell at the Foundation for Science Innovation and Development (FSID), the single window access to the deep science and deep tech within IISc. \"As we look towards 2025, the deep tech sector in India is on the brink of transformative growth, fuelled by a vibrant ecosystem of innovation and strategic government initiatives including defence. With over 4,000 deep tech startups currently operational and projections to reach 10,000 by 2030, we are witnessing a significant shift towards advanced technologies that address critical global challenges such as climate change, healthcare, and sustainable energy\u201d, Murali says.\n\nAccording to Murali, the anticipated launch of the National Deep Tech Startup Policy will foster collaboration between academia and industry, enhance funding opportunities, and promote research and development. \u201cWe expect to see a surge in AI-driven solutions in many sectors, particularly robotics and biotechnology, which will redefine traditional industries and create new market opportunities\u201d, he says."
