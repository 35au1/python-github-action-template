By the way, the US Embassy,' as Elizondo told attendees at the paid event, gesturing to the photo: 'That.'\n\nHe went on to describe it as a 'huge mini city floating in the sky.'\n\nBut the UFO, which resembles a gleaming disc-shaped craft, has already drawn withering critiques from skeptics, believers and even military UFO witnesses alike, who claim to have traced the photo to, not to the US Embassy, but a Facebook page.\n\nOne suggested to DailyMail.com that Elizondo has been lax in his vetting of such images in a bid to add sensational new material to his 'paid speaking engagements.'\n\nEx-Pentagon official Luis Elizondo (right), who gained fame for blowing the lid off a $22-million, secretive government UFO program, has revealed an image of a UFO 'mothership'\n\n'Guess what we caught in Romania in 2022? By the way, the US Embassy,' as Elizondo told attendees at the paid event, gesturing to the photo (above): 'That'\n\nVeteran US Air Force Staff Sergeant, Jeremy McGowan, who witnessed a dramatic UFO encounter himself in the Middle East decades ago, told DailyMail.com that Elizondo's dubious 'mothership' UFO fits a pattern with the man's past claims.\n\n'This unfortunate situation with Lue follows my experiences with him nearly exactly,' McGowan said. 'I witnessed him exaggerate or outright fabricate information that simply wasn't true.'\n\nElizondo unveiled the 2022 Romanian UFO photo at an October 28, 2024 event held at The City Winery, a wine bar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for $50-$30 per ticket.\n\n'There's a whole lot more here folks,' Elizondo told the audience in a leaked clip. 'I just want to give you kind of a small taste of what's going on \"behind the scenes.\"'\n\n'We're having pilots, military pilots and civilian pilots in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East, report what unimaginably seems impossible,' as Elizondo began to explain his 'real photo' of a UFO.\n\n'They described it literally 'the mothership,'' Elizondo said.\n\nBut despite credible federal reports of 'mothership' UFOs over domestic US military sites \u2014 investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), an FBI task force, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) and 16 local sheriff's offices \u2014 internet sleuths quickly managed to poke holes in Elizondo's 2022 Romanian UFO.\n\nJohn Greenewald Jr, a longtime government transparency advocate who runs The Black Vault, quickly tracked the photo back to a September 13, 2023 post in a Facebook group titled 'Mysterious Ancient Discoveries.'\n\nJohn Greenewald Jr, a longtime government transparency advocate who runs The Black Vault , quickly tracked the photo back to a September 13, 2023 post in a Facebook group titled ' Mysterious Ancient Discoveries' (above)\n\nThe higher resolution image of this apparent 'mothership,' which looks at first glance to be piercing clouds with its beatific shafts of light, appears more likely to have originated as the reflection of an indoor chandelier lamp reflected in window glass\n\n'I reverse imaged searched it,' Greenewald posted on X. 'It got more than 182,000 likes and more than 23,700 comments.'\n\nThe higher resolution image of this apparent 'mothership,' which looks at first glance to be piercing clouds with its beatific shafts of light, appears more likely to have originated as the reflection of an indoor chandelier lamp reflected in window glass.\n\nThe placement of Romania's coal-fired Arad Power Station indicates the image was not taken from the US Embassy, but a building near the Mure\u0219 River a few miles away.\n\nAmerica's Embassy in Romania is roughly 400 miles to the southeast of Arad, in the capital city of Bucharest.\n\nWhile dedicated UFO skeptics were eager to pounce on Elizondo's inaccurate claims, UFO enthusiasts also expressed frustration over the episode.\n\n'Lue is 100 percent using us as pawns to line his pockets,' one contributor to the Reddit forum r/UFOs lamented. 'His most recent book was no.1 seller in the nation.'\n\n'It's muddying the waters and detracting from the important convo,' another opined.\n\nBy midday Wednesday, Elizondo was publicly attributing the error to 'a friend in Government' who provided him with the photo 'a couple of years ago.'\n\nRetired USAF Staff Sergeant McGowan, however, told DailyMail.com that Elizondo's error was far from a one-off mistake.\n\n'I've been on the receiving end where Lue has pulled out his cell phone and shown me what he described as highly classified video,' McGowan told DailyMail.com.\n\nThe placement of Romania's coal-fired Arad Power Station (above) indicates the image was not taken from the US Embassy, but a building near the Mure\u0219 River a few miles away. America's Embassy in Romania is roughly 400 miles to the southeast of Arad, in Bucharest\n\n'For him to think I would believe he would simply carry classified info on an unsecure civilian cell phone is just insulting,' he added. 'And it wasn't just me, multiple podcast hosts were shown video Lue attributed to things they were not.'\n\nFor the past two years, McGowan has been notably public about this instance in which Elizondo showed him what he claimed was, in McGowan's words, 'a highly secret video smuggled out of Russia' taken by a Soviet Union probe near Mars.\n\nThe video, as McGowan recollected to DailyMail.com, looked to be a decades-old public UFO video from the Soviet's Phobos 2 probe, released by retired Soviet Air Force Colonel Marina Popovich in 1991.\n\nElizondo had shown the video to McGowan, in hushed tones, in January 2021.\n\nWhile Popovich, who wrote a book about her own UFO encounters as a test pilot, long maintained the Phobos 2 video depicted a legitimate alien craft, the odd video had nevertheless been public for about three decades, in other words.\n\n'There is a striking similarity between that public video and what Lue showed me on his phone,' McGowan recollected.\n\n'Only saw it for a few seconds,' he said, 'so the granular details didn't get absorbed.'\n\nMcGowan, whose duties in the Air Force included service in Desert Storm attached to Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and drug enforcement missions in Colombia, has been public for years on his own UFO encounter.\n\nIn the mid-90s, while serving as a member of the JSOC J2 Security Team for 'Ellipse Foxtrot,' Jeremy McGowan (above) says he was a witness to unusual aerial lights appearing to survey a highly classified cargo container he had been tasked with guarding in the desert\n\nFor the past two years, McGowan has been notably public about an instance in which Elizondo showed him what he claimed was, in McGowan's words, 'a highly secret video smuggled out of Russia' taken by a Soviet probe near Mars. The video however had been public since 1991\n\nIn the mid-90s, while serving as a member of the JSOC J2 Security Team for 'Ellipse Foxtrot,' McGowan says he was a witness to unusual aerial lights appearing to survey a highly classified cargo container he had been tasked with guarding in the desert.\n\nHe spoke to the History Channel about this UFO sighting in the Mid East for the 2020 docu-series 'Unidentified,' which had been hosted by Luis Elizondo.\n\nAs McGowan recollected about his appearance on the show in a Medium blog post, he had agreed to this on-camera interview in the hopes of getting back in touch with other witnesses to the event, but felt 'used' by the experience.\n\n'I was supposed to be introduced to investigators and researchers who could help me identify the person with me on that dune and saw what I saw!' he wrote in 2022.\n\n'I left with no answers [...] I sent a few emails to production that were ignored, and I was never extended the courtesy promised to me.'\n\nBy midday Wednesday, Elizondo was publicly attributing the error to 'a friend in Government' who provided him with the photo 'a couple of years ago' (above)\n\nElizondo unveiled the 2022 Romanian UFO photo at an October 28, 2004 event held at The City Winery, a wine bar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , for $50-$30 per ticket\n\nFederal government concern about 'mothership' UFOs harboring swarms of 'drones,' have spilled out into public view following the release of internal reports via the US Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in recent years.\n\nWeeks of reports of mystery 'drones' swept eastern Colorado and nearby areas of Nebraska, Wyoming and Kansas over the winter holidays of 2019 into the new year.\n\nThe sightings worried citizens and local law enforcement alike, but odd craft and thier 'motherships' troubled the US military especially for their proximity to some of America's sensitive, nuclear-equipped intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).\n\n'They all seem clustered in an area that has quite a few Minuteman sites,' a redacted official confessed in one email released via FOIA by F.E. Warren Air Force Base.\n\nF.E. Warren security staff spoke to local sheriff's deputies who ' reported seeing a 'mothership' six feet in diameter flanked by 10 smaller drones (some fixed wing, some not).'\n\n'When deputies follow the drones, they clock them at speeds of 60-70 mph,' the redacted base official stated."

        "article_content": "Carl Petrick is a sky-watcher.\n\nThe East Moline resident and Moline native is a retired longtime zookeeper at Niabi Zoo. He studies his surroundings with scientific attention. Science is his religion, Petrick said. The 66-year-old just wants to figure it all out.\n\n\u201cMoving things,\u201d in particular, are fascinating to him. He\u2019s an avid bird-watcher. Birds\u2019 camouflaging abilities, their ability to fly into the wind, their speed \u2014 it\u2019s all impressive to Petrick.\n\n\u201cPeople are smart, but we can't do some of the things they do,\u201d he said.\n\nPetrick is willing to go to great lengths to identify birds he spots in local parks \u2014 once, he chased a bird 50 yards just to get answers after he glimpsed it through a bush. Eventually, he tracked it down.\n\nBut there\u2019s one flyer that got away. It\u2019s nagged at him for more than 50 years.\n\nPetrick is one of several Quad-Citians who reported seeing UFOs over several days in early March 1967. At the time, Petrick was a 9-year-old student at Sacred Heart Catholic School, now Seton Catholic, in Moline.\n\nThe record of this local UFO phenomenon, which stretched across multiple counties in western Illinois, is part of Project Blue Book, the U.S. Air Force investigation of UFOs in the 1950s and 1960s, a time of heightened concern due to the Cold War.\n\nNuns, sheriff\u2019s deputies, elementary students and more reported seeing something in the sky that spring.\n\nThe story is still vivid in Petrick\u2019s head.\n\nIf he stares long enough at a wall, he can close his eyes and see it like it was yesterday.\n\nIt\u2019s not an airplane\n\nPetrick saw it between 2 and 3 p.m., as he went back inside for class, he said. The weather was chilly but clear.\n\n\u201cI looked up and I saw something in the distance,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nTo his naked eye, the object in the western sky looked like a spot or a small silvery thing. He estimated its height to be like that of airplanes when they emit contrails as they fly over.\n\nAs Petrick watched the object, Bill Fisher, a Moline police officer, came around the corner. The officer had binoculars or a movie camera with him. Fisher looked at the object then handed the instrument he carried to Petrick.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d the police officer asked the boy.\n\nWith the instrument\u2019s assistance, Petrick saw a silver, cigar-shaped object with what Petrick described as three long windows along the side. Those windows were powder blue, like the jersey shade of the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nThe thing was not moving and Petrick estimated its length to be between 20 and 40 feet.\n\nPetrick told Fisher the thing was not an airplane, then the police officer said he had to go.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last I saw of him,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nThat day, Fisher recorded the object with a portable 8mm movie camera. He and his recording would be a central part of the Air Force\u2019s investigation.\n\nAfter Fisher left, Petrick watched the object for about 10 more minutes before returning to class, he said. About 30 or 45 minutes later, he came back outside.\n\n\u201cIt was still there,\u201d Petrick said.\n\nAt home a short time later, he observed it again with his father and brother, using a small telescope. The object still had not moved and its appearance remained the same.\n\nPetrick does not know what the object was, but he said he knows what it wasn\u2019t. It was not a bird or a butterfly, he said. It was not an airplane, helicopter or zeppelin.\n\nBy the process of elimination, he concluded it was a UFO.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, so obviously and logically, it would be unidentified,\u201d he said. \u201cJust common sense.\u201d\n\nNow decades removed from the event, Petrick said he does not think the object had a human origin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not from here,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just observing us like we observe.\u201d\n\nPetrick said he saw the object in the same place in the sky for several days after those initial sightings.\n\nThen, one day, it wasn\u2019t there.\n\nInitially, he thought it might have moved. After a bit more time, he decided it was gone for good.\n\nDuck and cover\n\nAt the time of the Quad-Cities sighting, the Cold War was in full swing. The rivalry between America and the Soviet Union even extended into space.\n\nPetrick remembered a childhood game he and his friends played, inspired by the monthly emergency siren tests. When they heard the siren, the children would pretend the Russians were attacking.\n\nPeople feared a nuclear holocaust, Petrick said. Incidents like the Bay of Pigs had occurred and the conflict in Vietnam was heating up.\n\n\u201cWe were so inundated with the Cold War\u2019s \u2018Russians are bad, we\u2019re good,\u2019\u201d Petrick said.\n\nHe also described an exercise he had to do at school: the duck-and-cover drill.\n\n\u201cIf the siren goes off, get under your desk because if a bomb explodes, you\u2019ll be protected,\u201d he said.\n\nShould they find themselves in the hallway, children were supposed to get against the wall and cover themselves as best they could, he said.\n\nThe school phased that drill out while he was still a student.\n\nThere was also a big emphasis on science in school because of the Cold War. The Russians had their Sputnik satellite. The Americans were after the Moon.\n\nAfter he saw the object in the sky that day, Petrick said, he considered, then discarded, the possibility that another nation was behind it.\n\n\u201cIf it was Russian or Chinese or whatever, you think it would have been attacking the States or would have been doing something to throw us off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just sat there.\u201d\n\nNot just Petrick\n\nPetrick wasn\u2019t the only person in the Quad-Cities who spotted a UFO that week. The local newspapers covered the phenomenon extensively.\n\nJames Maifield, of Silvis, reported that he and his wife spotted a \u201cwhite light\u201d in the sky for several minutes. An anonymous Silvis police dispatcher told the Moline Dispatch she saw a \u201cweird\u201d white light, too.\n\nGary Bennett, an Augustana College student, told the Times-Democrat he saw an \u201cunfamiliar airborne vehicle\u201d around 9:30 p.m. on March 9.\n\nArnold Buchmeyer, Helen DeRocker and Leo Schmitz, all of Moline, separately reported to the Times-Democrat that they saw something strange in the sky, too. Schmitz said it was \u201cvery white\u201d and \u201cmoving northwesterly.\u201d\n\nA Northwestern University astronomer speculated that it was just the planet Venus.\n\nThe weekend after the sightings, pranksters were caught deploying a balloon with a candle that crash-landed in Rock Island. A similar balloon was found near the Monmouth waste disposal plant on Thursday, March 9, pieced together with soda straws.\n\nJimmie Scott, a 12-year-old from Buffalo, Iowa, told the Times-Democrat he got out of bed around 2 a.m. on March 9 to get a drink of water. He looked into the sky and saw a \u201cbright, white object that looked like a saucer.\u201d\n\nHis sketch of the saucer was published on the front pages of the Times-Democrat.\n\nThe principal witness, though, was Fisher, the Moline officer who greeted Petrick on the campus of Sacred Heart.\n\nThe star witness\n\nAfter the Quad-Cities area sightings drew the attention of the federal government, Fisher was interviewed at length by the U.S. Air Force, who sent Capt. Edward Orenic and Capt. Anton Kato to investigate.\n\nAfter their visit, they produced a 94-page report on their methods, avenues of inquiry and conclusions. The report is available online through the U.S. National Archives.\n\nThe two captains cast a wide net, the report shows. Their efforts included interviewing witnesses and collecting weather data. They also checked with regional military, airport and National Weather Service officials for aircraft and weather balloon flights as well as for reports of anything strange.\n\nOrenic and Kato took particular interest in Fisher\u2019s account and the footage he took.\n\nThe officer told the Air Force that he was initially at Sacred Heart on March 9 to deliver a message to his son, a student there. He arrived around 1:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cAt this time, I glanced upward above the treetops and viewed a object that I was not sure of its description or its identity,\u201d he told investigators.\n\nHe described the object as \u201cU-shaped \u2014 like a pickle,\u201d and said he watched it for \u201ca precious minute and a half.\u201d Soon after, he began shooting footage with his 8mm camera, using a telescopic lens and outdoor film. The footage is also available online in the U.S. National Archives.\n\nFisher told the Dispatch in 2015 that he kept the camera in storage on his motorcycle, aware that UFO rumors were already swirling in town.\n\n\u201cThere were stories all around,\u201d he told the Dispatch. \u201cI was just naturally curious.\u201d\n\nAfter he arrived on the campus, Fisher says the object then began moving \u201cnorthwesterly\u201d away from him. It \u201cappeared to have stopped\u201d and hovered, he said, and then it continued its pace until it faded from view.\n\n\u201cBefore it faded away here, before it got completely obscure, I did have a definite sighting of a metallic, shiny surface on the side,\u201d he said. \u201cThe side that was the broad side to me, was metallic and appeared to be of the same construction like some of our large aircrafts that I\u2019ve seen here.\u201d\n\nAs he stood at the school, Fisher asked several kids and a state policeman\u2019s wife about what they saw. The woman told him it \u201clooked shiny and reflected a white light.\u201d Fisher said he didn\u2019t spot any lights or objects connected to the craft. He heard no sound emitted from the object, but the woman reported a hissing or whirring sound.\n\nIn the report, captains Orenic and Kato also highlighted the accounts of two sheriff\u2019s deputies, one from Knox County and the other from Henry County.\n\nThe Knox County deputy\u2019s account was that early on March 6, 1967, he saw a flying object.\n\nHis account included that it was shaped like an upside-down bowl, the report states. It had a glowing red base and at one point emitted a bright beam of white light.\n\nThe deputy from Henry County saw something in the sky late on March 8, the report states.\n\nThe deputy\u2019s description included that the object was framed by three lights \u2014 one red, one white and one green. Periodically it would emit an intense red light bright enough to obscure the other three lights.\n\nSo what\u2019s the verdict?\n\nOrenic and Kato concluded at the end of the report that the sightings most likely involved the mundane.\n\nIn Fisher\u2019s case, the object was most likely an air vehicle \u2013 a plane or helicopter, the report states. In another part of the report, Orenic and Kato also state it could have been a balloon.\n\n\u201cThe description, duration and flight characteristics are similar to that of a balloon,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe 8mm film failed to reveal any information that would dispute this evaluation.\u201d\n\nThe captains said the Henry County deputy\u2019s sighting was also likely an aircraft.\n\nThe Knox County sighting was probably of a home-made hot air balloon created using a garment bag, similar to the one Rock Island pranksters made the weekend of March 12, and the one recovered in the Monmouth area. The method of making the balloons had been published in a national magazine, the report states.\n\nDuring that period, two red kites along with batteries and a light bulb were also recovered in the Galesburg area, according to the report.\n\nNearly all the witnesses Orenic and Kato interviewed appeared extremely reliable but had a \u201cstrong desire to see something\u201d or an attitude of \u201cthought I\u2019d never see a saucer,\u201d the report states.\n\nThose attitudes, the extensive news coverage and prank launchings appeared to have caused wide-spread UFO sightings, the captains wrote.\n\nStill looking, still believing\n\nIn 2015, the year before Fisher\u2019s death at the age of 81, the Dispatch interviewed him about the incident. They asked how he felt about investigators pointing out his affinity for science fiction and \u201cstrong desire to see something\u201d \u2014 the report said, for example, that Fisher \u201cwatches the sky every chance he gets.\u201d\n\nThe former officer told the Dispatch he felt investigators were fishing for statements like that. But Fisher remained \u201cadamant that he saw what he saw,\u201d even years later.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what it was, but it most certainly wasn\u2019t a balloon,\u201d the Dispatch wrote. \u201cAnd several other people saw it and were startled by it, too.\u201d\n\nPetrick also stands by his story. He said he never read the conclusions of the Air Force, but he doesn\u2019t mind skepticism. Like Fisher, he knows what he saw.\n\n\u201cPeople believe in love,\u201d Petrick said. \u201cCan you prove it? Can you prove it\u2019s there?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also quick to point out that his interest in the UFO comes from a place of scientific curiosity, not opportunity. It\u2019s the bird that got away.\n\nPetrick jokes about his father, whose experience with the unknown was a little different. Milton Petrick lived in rural New Jersey when Orson Welles\u2019 \u201cWar of The Worlds\u201d went over the radio the night before Halloween in 1938. Milton and his buddies saw through the radio play\u2019s facade, but took it as a chance to improve the town.\n\n\u201cThey went down with their shotguns and rifles and shot the water tower, called the police and said, \u2018Yeah, we just killed a Martian,\u2019\u201d Petrick laughs. \u201cThey got their new water tower out of it.\u201d\n\nPetrick, though, isn\u2019t looking for a new water tower. He\u2019s just looking for answers. To this day, the 66-year-old scans the western sky almost daily, longing to see the UFO again. The uncertainty, though, is a sort of gift.\n\n\u201cEverybody has beliefs that they can't prove,\u201d Petrick said. \u201cWhich is actually a good thing, or life would be boring.\u201d\n\nWhile walking around the grounds of his old elementary school on a recent fall day, Petrick\u2019s voice rattled with a certain giddiness. He shuffled his feet along the sidewalk. Every time he found the perfect spot to recreate the memory, he\u2019d find an even better one a few inches over.\n\n\u201cNow it really hits home,\u201d Petrick said, aligning a triangle between the rightmost spire on the church steeple and the roof of the school.\n\nHe lingered in the neighborhood for about a half hour, in awe of the sky. Waiting, perhaps, for an answer to appear. The weather conditions were similar to those in 1967. The sky was clear and a seasonal chill lingered in the air.\n\nFor a moment, a plane flew overhead to the north. Petrick estimated it was about the same size as the UFO of 1967. The jet left contrails behind, but they faded after a few minutes.\n\nPetrick kept on looking, raising his hand to his forehead to block out the sun \u2014 a salute, of sorts, to the puzzling sky."

It's a trade-off, because the Weather app's data widgets are so big as to require scrolling to get the full picture of a day, and you can't move the AI summary or 10-day forecast off the top.

        "article_content": "Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET\n\nAnthropic is expanding its Claude AI beyond the web. On Thursday, the company unveiled new desktop applications for its popular chatbot. Designed for Windows and MacOS, the new apps work similarly to the website and are available for free users and paid subscribers.\n\nTo grab the apps, head to the Claude for Desktop site, where you'll find versions for Windows, Windows on ARM, and MacOS. For now, the apps are tagged with a beta label, which may indicate that Anthropic is still tweaking them. After downloading one of the apps, you'll be prompted to sign in using a Google account or an email link. From there, use Claude just as you would use the website.\n\nAlso: How Claude's new AI data analysis tool compares to ChatGPT's version (hint: it doesn't)\n\nAsk a question. Submit a request. Start a conversation. You can ask Claude to analyze or summarize different types of files that you upload, including images, Microsoft Office files, PDFs, text files, HTML files, and code files.\n\nYou're able to access your chat history to view and resume a previous conversation. The Windows and Mac apps sync with the website and mobile apps, so you'll find the same conversation history across the board. Plus, you can view your profile settings and account and billing details.\n\nClaude is also sporting a new dictation mode. Accessible only from the Claude AI mobile apps for iOS/iPadOS and Android, the dictation feature lets you speak your request instead of typing it. This is always a handy option, especially if you don't like having to tap out lengthy prompts on a mobile device. Using dictation mode, you can carry on a real-time conversation with Claude and even respond to questions from the AI.\n\nTo try dictation, just tap the microphone icon, speak, and then tap the X button to stop. Claude displays its response on the screen. To continue the conversation, just tap the microphone icon again and dictate another question or request.\n\nLooking to challenge other AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini, Anthropic has been on a tear trying to fine-tune and expand Claude.\n\nAlso: I tested this viral AI image generator, and it does text well - finally! Try it for free\n\nThe company recently released a new model of Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Currently in beta mode for developers to use via an API, the new version can interact with a computer by looking at the screen, moving the cursor, clicking buttons, and entering text via a virtual keyboard.\n\nIn August, Anthropic kicked off a feature known as Artifacts. Available to free and paid users on the website, the mobile apps, and the new desktop apps, Artifacts can help you create a website, a page of code, a visual presentation, or another project by displaying the results in real time right next to your conversation."

        "article_content": "SALEM, Ohio \u2014 In between the cracks of Gothic buildings and rusty swing carousels lies a dark past, one that the West Virginia Department of Tourism\u2019s Paranormal Trail seeks to uncover.\n\nLaunched on Oct. 1, the Paranormal Trail is a digital passport that rewards individuals for visiting West Virginia\u2019s reportedly most haunted locations through a tier system of prizes. In its first two weeks alone, the trail saw over 5,000 sign-ups.\n\nOn a larger scale, the trail takes visitors on a tour of the state, exposing its rich history and that not everything is as it seems.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to experience something different at everyone you go to,\u201d said Michelle Graham, filming and events manager for Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum. \u201cYou can learn so much about things that are unexplained by the people who spend so much time in these buildings.\u201d\n\nLake Shawnee\n\nBeneath the soil of Lake Shawnee abandoned amusement park lies thousands of years of history. It starts with the Native American Shawnee tribe which occupied West Virginia for nearly 2,000 years before the United States government told them to assimilate or leave in 1831.\n\nOne of the most notable Shawnee leaders was Chief Cornstalk, originally named Hokleskwa, which translates loosely to \u201cstalk of corn.\u201d He was the leader of the Shawnee nation between 1720-1777.\n\nCornstalk was murdered by American militiamen while on a diplomatic visit in November 1777, during the American Revolutionary War. His death furthered tensions between the two groups.\n\nAround the same time, the first English settlers in Mercer County, the Clay family, moved to what is now known as the Lake Shawnee property in 1775. Mitchell and Phoebe Clay had 16 children, but three of them would be massacred by the Shawnee tribe in 1783.\n\nViolent deaths continued to plague the property after Conley T. Snidow turned it into an amusement park, which opened in 1926. Six children were killed in accidents at Lake Shawnee Amusement Park between 1926 and 1967, when the park finally closed.\n\nThe park was reopened by former employee Gaylord White in 1987 but would only operate as an amusement park for two years before closing again.\n\nAt a crossroads with what to do, Gaylord and his son, Chris White, the current owner of Lake Shawnee, decided to turn the property into a mud bog in 1989 \u2014 but they would uncover something much more valuable than dirt.\n\nWhile bulldozing the empty field in 1990, they started finding arrowheads and pieces of pottery. Gaylord immediately stopped and called Marshall University archaeologists to inspect the land. The team would uncover loads of Native American artifacts between 1990-1991, as well as a Shawnee burial ground.\n\nToday, the site pays homage to the Shawnee tribe where artifacts are on display. Additionally, Chris White provides a brief history on the Shawnee tribe. Someday, he hopes to create a small Native American museum on-site.\n\nThe abandoned amusement park also honors the other deaths that occurred on site, including the Clay family and the children who died while the amusement park was in operation.\n\nOver the years, visitors have left offerings to the Native Americans or the children like handcrafted items, stuffed animals, pinwheels and various toys.\n\n\u201cWe ask anybody that comes to bring an offering, and the offering doesn\u2019t need to be valuable,\u201d Chris White said. \u201cIt\u2019s better if it means something to you.\u201d\n\n1 of 19\n\nNumerous TV shows and paranormal investigators have also visited the site to film and experience the ghosts of the park\u2019s past. Many claim the spirits of the children who died at the park remain there today.\n\nSince taking part in the Paranormal Trail, Chris White has seen an increase in visitors at Lake Shawnee. He hopes more people continue visiting Lake Shawnee and the other sites on the Paranormal trail.\n\n\u201cVistors should come to Lake Shawnee because it\u2019s unique,\u201d Chris White said. \u201cYou will learn a lot about Native American history and their culture, the way they lived and the way they died. You can walk the creepy trail (where the Clay children died) and you can go around the park and take photos of the Ferris Wheel and swings.\u201d\n\nLake Shawnee, 470 Matoaka Road, Rock, West Virginia, offers daytime tours and overnight stays by appointment only. For more information, call or text 304-921-1580, or visit www.wvlakeshawnee.com.\n\nTrans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum\n\nLurking in the halls of the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum are decades\u2019 worth of memories that are both tragic and pleasant in equal measure.\n\n\u201cWe ran the entire gamut of mental health treatment progression in the years that the asylum was in operation,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThere was a lot of dark history there, but at the same time we want to highlight and showcase that this was somebody\u2019s home. There were people who cried when the asylum closed in 1994 because they\u2019d spent their entire lives here. We have just as much good as we have bad.\u201d\n\nConstruction on the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum began in 1858. The facility opened in 1864, although work on it would continue until 1881. It is the largest hand-cut stone masonry building in North America and is the second largest in the world, next to the Kremlin. The asylum was originally designed to provide care for 250 patients.\n\nIn the beginning, there weren\u2019t strong criteria for admitting patients, Graham said. However, over time, the asylum would start separating the patients based on needs within the wards of the asylum including violent females, violent males, tuberculosis and more.\n\nThe oldest section of the building is the Civil War section, which housed both Union and Confederate soldiers during the early days of operations.\n\nAt its peak in the 1950s, the asylum housed 2,400 patients. Treatments ranged from lobotomies, electroshock therapy and hydrotherapy in the early years to various forms of discussion-based therapy and antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs in the later years.\n\nEventually, with the evolution of modern-day healthcare, outpatient care became more common which is one of the contributing factors for the asylums closure in 1994. The asylum reopened as a tourist attraction in March 2008.\n\nToday, the asylum acts not only as one of the most unique pieces of architecture in the world but seeks to highlight the evolution of mental health care. Graham adds that the treatments of lobotomies and electroshock therapy given prior to the 1960s are often misinterpreted as acts of vengeance.\n\n\u201cThis was not just some horror place that that they were experimenting on patients,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThey 100% believed that it was the best medical practice that was going to help the patients that resided at the asylum at the time.\u201d\n\nThe Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, 50 S River Ave., Weston, West Virginia, is part of West Virginia\u2019s Paranormal Trail and has many tours available, including the history tour, discover the asylum tour, photography tours, ghost tours and more. Reservations are required for some of the tours. For more information, visit trans-alleghenylunaticasylum.com.\n\nParanormal Trail\n\nThe trail includes 18 haunted stops across West Virginia. To join the journey, interested parties need to register to receive a link that opens up a personal digital passport.\n\nVisitors will click the check-in button, upon visiting a location, which earns them prizes the more locations they visit. At three locations, participants get a Paranormal Trail sticker, at 10 they get a Paranormal Trail beanie and by visiting all 18 they get a limited edition Paranormal Trail print designed by West Virginia artist Liz Pavlovic.\n\nThe challenge lasts until the end of the year. However, if it proves to be popular, the West Virginia Department of Tourism may extend it to next year.\n\nSites on the Paranormal Trail include:\n\nMothman Museum; Point Pleasant, West Virginia; www.mothmanmuseum.com\n\nWest Virginia Penitentiary; Moundsville, West Virginia; wvpentours.com\n\nThe Blennerhassett Hotel; Parkersburg, West Virginia; theblennerhassett.com\n\nGhost Tour of Harpers Ferry; Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; www.harpersferryghost.20m.com\n\nHotel Morgan; Morgantown, West Virginia; www.hotelmorgan.com\n\nFlatwoods Monster Museum; Sutton, West Virginia; braxtonwv.org/the-flatwoods-monster/visit-the-museum\n\nThe Old Hospital on College Hill; Williamson, West Virginia; www.collegehillhospital.com\n\nThe Historic Glen Ferris Inn; Glen Ferris, West Virginia; www.glenferrisinn.com/home-9866\n\nShepherdstown Mystery Walk; Shepherdstown, West Virginia; shepherdstownmysterywalks.com\n\nThe Haunted Haymond; Sutton, West Virginia; www.facebook.com/thehaymondhousehaunted\n\nFlinderation Tunnel, Salem, West Virginia\n\nBigfoot Statue (Elk River Trail); Ivydale, West Virginia; www.elkrivertrail.org/rail-trailheads/06\n\nWest Virginia Bigfoot Museum; Sutton, West Virginia; wvbigfootmuseum.org\n\nSilver Run Tunnel (North Bend Rail Trail); Cairo, West Virginia; wvstateparks.com/park/north-bend-rail-trail\n\nCryptid Mountain Miniature Golf; Morgantown, West Virginia; www.cryptidmountainminigolf.com\n\nHempfield Tunnel (Wheeling Heritage Trail); Wheeling, West Virginia; www.wheelingwv.gov/directory/Parks-Recreation/heritage-trail\n\nFor more information, visit wvtourism.com/west-virginia-paranormal-trail.\n\n(Liz Partsch can be reached at epartsch@farmanddairy.com or 330-337-3419.)"

        "article_content": "As India continues its rapid development and is set to become a USD 7 trillion economy by 2030, businesses face immense pressure to innovate quickly and operate more efficiently than ever before. Due to the current demand to outpace competitors and respond quickly to customers, businesses today operate in a hyper-evolving environment with the need for rapid innovation, increased agility, and real-time customer care.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhen it comes to the application development process, for many years, only two options were available to organizations: purchasing ready-made solutions off the shelf or employing skilled programmers to create solutions from scratch. This has changed with the introduction of low-code/no-code (LCNC) development platforms that have revolutionized how businesses develop applications by making the process easy and more available to a wider section of the workforce These platforms can lead to cost reductions of up to 70% compared to traditional application development methods. In fact, a recent survey from Gartner indicates that by 2025, 87% of new applications developed by enterprises will use low-code or no-code technologies.\n\nLCNC platforms have changed the traditional development approach that could only be implemented by technical users. Now, both technical and non-technical users are able to make applications without additional coding knowledge. So, these platforms allow citizen developers to rise and become leaders in their business processes and workflows. These platforms empower \"citizen developers\" not only to adopt new techniques and strategies but also to get involved in the whole process of application development.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nUnderstanding Low-Code/No-Code Platforms\n\nFirst of all, both low-code and no-code platforms are programming customization techniques for a high level of expertise in IT, and these two differ in the extent of expertise in information technology required. Low-code development platforms offer a more user-friendly coding experience, which means that a partial amount of programming skill will be required. Thus, the developers are free to do their part of coding as well as to create applications in a personalized manner that meets the unique requirements of the user's business. On the flip side, no-code platforms are completely free from coding as they support those with no technical skills to design applications. Beyond this, businesses can also develop applications using the drag-and-drop method without employing any programmers.\n\nLCNC platforms are designed to make application development faster and more efficient. Whether automating workflows, streamlining processes, or improving customer experiences, LCNC platforms provide the flexibility and speed businesses need to stay competitive. The growing adoption of LCNC platforms has led to impressive market growth. According to Forrester, the combined low-code and digital process automation (DPA) market reached $13.2 billion by the end of 2023, with a projected growth rate of 21% since 2019. This surge is driven largely by the institutionalization of low-code in IT, with 87% of enterprise developers now using low-code platforms for some development work. Furthermore, Forrester predicts this growth to continue, with the market potentially reaching $30 billion by 2028, driven by the increasing adoption of citizen development strategies.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nFuture Growth Potential\n\nWith the rise of generative AI market growth at an annual rate of 36% according to Forrester, LCNC platforms, being inherently flexible and AI-compatible, are poised to benefit from this trend. A similar AI-driven explosion in citizen development could push the LCNC and DPA market to $50 billion by 2028. However, a shift toward high-code methods due to AI-infused development platforms might slow LCNC growth, aligning it with the broader software market's 11% annual growth rate.\n\nThe Rise of Citizen Developers\n\nAdvertisment\n\nOne of the most significant impact of LCNC platforms is the rise of citizen developers\u2014non-technical users who now actively participate in application development. These individuals, often business process owners, possess deep knowledge of their domain but lack formal coding expertise. With LCNC tools, they can develop applications that address their unique challenges, driving innovation within their departments.\n\nThousands of companies are using low-code platforms to develop business-critical solutions. As businesses mature, however, some may encounter nonstandard practices that basic low-code platforms can't address. Borrowing development practices from core development, such as unit testing or build quality control, can help improve a solution\u2019s quality and reduce team effort.\n\nApplications Across Industries\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe versatility of LCNC platforms has led to their adoption across a wide range of industries. For instance, in supply chain management, businesses can develop applications to enhance visibility, traceability, and efficiency. In manufacturing, LCNC tools are powering smart factories by integrating IoT networks and automating workflows.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nIn finance and accounting, LCNC platforms enable businesses to automate complex tasks such as loan approvals and risk assessments. Human resources teams are using them to streamline hiring processes and develop training programs, while even IT departments benefit from faster application development and increased agility.\n\nLCNC platforms play a significant role in business process automation (BPA), complementing robotic process automation (RPA) solutions. RPA bots can follow rules set by citizen developers, reducing bottlenecks and increasing efficiency.\n\nLow-code visual software development is a powerful solution for modernizing legacy systems at reduced cost and with minimal risk. Low-code platforms provide developers with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface through which they find it easier to accelerate their software development and minimize inefficiencies accompanied by security vulnerabilities typical for traditional systems. In general, legacy applications, including ERP systems, happen to be quite cumbersome to update and not cost-effective.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHowever, low-code platforms enable organizations to modernize such systems by integrating cloud-based innovations and extending them with modern web and mobile interfaces without the need to undertake costly customized development. It also helps in the gradual phasing out of existing obsolete applications without causing a jolt.\n\nAn important feature of low-code platforms is the democratization of software development, wherein the complexity of coding work is abstracted into more user-friendly and visual interfaces. This enables the possibility of collaboration among developers with varying skill levels, accelerates time-to-market, and reduces the risk of error. In addition, the built-in security and compliance features ensure that applications are better designed and show adherence to specific industry standards, which enhances the resilience of digital infrastructure.\n\nSuch low-code platforms offer pre-built connectors and APIs that connect easily to legacy systems for easy access to data and, thus, even modernization becomes a simplified exercise. Organizations can unlock actual new opportunities for innovation by embracing low-code development, thus propelling business growth in this fast-paced digital landscape."

On an earnings call Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta's rapid growth highlights the company's continued focus on advancing AI and developing related tools.\n\n\"(Meta AI is) obviously very early in its journey, but it continues to be on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by end of year,\" Meta CFO Susan Li said on the call.\n\nThe Meta AI milestone also reflects the company's hopes to become the dominant leader in the consumer AI space as it expands capabilities across its ecosystem. Although the company said it expects to have strong return on investment over the next few years as it relates to AI, Zuckerberg warned capital spending will be up as a result as it requires \"serious infrastructure.\"\n\n\"I expect to continue investing significantly there too,\" he said. \"We haven't decided on a final budget yet, but those are some of the directional trends I'm seeing.\"\n\nRead more: What Is Meta AI? Everything to Know About the Social Network's AI Tools\n\nThird-quarter sales jumped 19% from the same period last year but marked the lowest year-over-year growth in a year and a half.\n\nMeta is just one of the companies leaning hard on AI technology, weaving it into its popular apps Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. As the company revealed at its Connect 2024 event in September, Meta's goal is to go beyond basic chatbot functions and offer an AI assistant that can handle complex tasks.\n\nIt's far from alone: Google has its own AI tools, like Google Assistant and Gemini, its free chatbot, akin to ChatGPT. And Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri are task-oriented assistants, while ChatGPT and Snapchat's My AI help with conversational experience. In Meta's case, AI shows up in familiar places. When a Facebook or Instagram user attempts to make a search, for example, they're shown popular AI questions they might want to ask.\n\nWatch this: Watch Everything Revealed at Meta Connect 2024 11:48\n\nMore time on Facebook, Instagram\n\nZuckerberg noted on the call, however, that improvements to Meta's AI-driven feed and video recommendations have driven an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year, highlighting its strategy to improve engagement and create more personalized experiences.\n\nMeta has also seen growth around Threads, its latest social platform, which now boasts almost 275 million monthly active users and over 1 million signups each day.\n\n\"Engagement is growing too,\" Zuckerberg said. \"So we continue to be on track toward this becoming our next major social app.\"\n\nMeta's open-source AI model Llama also continues to grow in popularity with an anticipated Llama 4 release early next year, according to the company. Meta is training the next-generation Llama models on a computing cluster, known as a group of machine learning models, which he claimed is \"bigger than anything I've seen reported for what others are doing,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\n\"I'm pretty amped about all the work that we're doing right now,\" Zuckerberg said. \"This may be the most dynamic moment that I've seen in our industry, and I'm focused on making sure that we build some awesome things and make the most of the opportunities ahead.\""

        "date": "Fleet News11h",
        "source": "Fleet News",
        "article_content": "This feature was taken from our Fleet Leadership special report\n\nIn recent years, fleet decision-makers have been hit with massive levels of hype around new technologies which are predicted to transform the way they move people and goods.\n\nBut much-talked about concepts such as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) and self-driving vehicles have \u2013 as of yet \u2013 struggled to make any meaningful impact as either the technology, legislation or other factors have stymied their introduction.\n\nDevelopment work on them continues, however, and they are still expected to have a major impact in the future, but for now vehicle manufacturers are talking more about another concept: the software-defined vehicle (SDV).\n\n\u201cBetween about 2016 and 2021, those in OEM circles were talking about CASE \u2013 connected, automated, shared, electric \u2013 but that phrase is pretty much dead now,\u201d says Jack Palmer, principal consultant at analysts Frost and Sullivan.\n\n\u201cNo one talks about that any more. If you go through OEMs\u2019 annual statements or reports, they talk about the SDV, which brings together all of those concepts.\u201d\n\nJonathan Davenport, senior director analyst at Gartner, agrees. \u201cThe biggest trend for sure at the moment is the SDV,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the past, autonomous vehicle technology was the number one topic people were enquiring about.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s definitely about SDVs and the impact they will have on the market.\u201d\n\nEach year, Gartner assesses new mobility technologies in its hype cycle series of reports and in its Hype Cycle for Connected Electric and Autonomous Vehicles 2024 document it has described the benefit of SDVs as \u201ctransformational\u201d.\n\nUnder its ranking system, it puts them as being at the peak of inflated expectations \u2013 a period of overenthusiasm and unrealistic projections, where a flurry of well-publicised activity by technology leaders results in some successes, but more failures, as the innovation is pushed to its limits \u2013 and five-to-10 years away from entering the mainstream.\n\nWhat is an SDV?\n\nIt is already possible to make over-the-air (OTA) software updates to the on-board system of some vehicles, as well as applying software patches to improve safety or functionality.\n\nSome manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Tesla, also offer a limited number of software-based services that drivers can subscribe to, such as parking and safety assistance functions.\n\n\u201cThe consumer demand hasn\u2019t been fantastic for these, but it\u2019s certainly there,\u201d says Palmer.\n\nHowever, the SDV concept takes this idea much further and is seen as a significant evolution by the automotive industry, helping to pave the way for further technological advancements such as autonomous vehicles.\n\nKey to this is the architecture of the vehicle. Modern vehicles use an increasing number of on-board computers to make them work: a typical connected car has between 60 and 80 electronic control units (ECUs), all dedicated to a single function such as vehicle lighting, driving aids and power steering.\n\nThe idea with the SDV is to have a streamlined infrastructure using just one or two ECUs, which are much more powerful, more robust and more flexible than the vehicle needs when it is built.\n\nAs well as controlling the car\u2019s functions and process the huge amount of data collected by its various sensors, they will have the capacity to accommodate new functions without slowing the system down.\n\nThis will change the historic link between hardware and software development life-cycles.\n\n\u201cAn analogy I use is what happened in consumer electronics about 20 years ago,\u201d says Davenport.\n\n\u201cYou had all your separate electronic items; your video camera, your digital camera, your calculator, your mobile phone, etc.\n\n\u201cThe companies would encourage you to buy the new model after a couple of years so you could go from a 20MP camera to a 25MP camera, for example.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s almost where we are with automotive today as if you want to get the new functionality you need to buy another car in a few years\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cThe change we are going to see with SDV is that we will get this continuous improvement driven by the software.\u201d\n\nManufacturers will be able to offer OTA updates beyond what is currently possible, allowing them to make money from subscription sales of digital content and software-based features.\n\nIn addition, indirect monetisation benefits will be achieved through OTA updates that fix warranty or recall issues.\n\nThis will change the business model for OEMs, as they will want to drive revenue by selling software-enabled services during the vehicle\u2019s life than just the one-time sale or lease of it. These services promise to deliver much higher gross margins.\n\nStellantis, for example, forecasts around \u20ac20 billion in incremental annual revenue, with a 40% gross margin by 2030, fuelled by software-enabled vehicles.\n\nFleet benefits\n\nThe focus on software \u2013 and with it data \u2013 could have major benefits for fleets.\n\nDavenport says although some major manufacturers are developing their own operating systems, many others \u2013 including General Motors, Volvo, Ford, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and Renault Nissan Mitsubishi \u2013 are using Google\u2019s Android Automotive.\n\nThis should not be confused with Android Auto, which is a mobile app developed by Google to mirror features of a smartphone on a vehicle\u2019s infotainment system.\n\nOne potential effect is that multiple OEMs using the same operating system in their vehicles could change the way fleets use telematics.\n\nCurrently there is no way of getting consistent data collection from different brands of vehicles on a fleet unless fleet decision-makers use aftermarket devices, says Davenport.\n\n\u201cWe always see two counter-trends in the vehicle telematics space,\u201d he adds. \u201cOne is we see organisations trying to dig out the cost of their traditional telematics services so we\u2019ve seen a movement from the black box to an OBD2 dongle, potentially even going to a smartphone application or maybe sourcing data direct from the automotive manufacturer.\n\n\u201cThe counter-trend is that the video telematics space is putting higher-performance computers in an aftermarket box into the vehicle.\n\n\u201cBut what I think could happen with Android Automotive is that an application could be deployed into the different vehicles\u2019 infotainment systems to request things like access to the forward-facing camera, access to the driver monitoring system etc., and so you could have a fleet management package that runs in the vehicle.\n\n\u201cThe automotive manufacturers are still acting as gatekeepers to their application marketplaces, so that may impede this vision, but certainly in the longer term I think that\u2019s what will happen as Android Automotive provides the common data platform that we\u2019ve never really had in the past.\u201d\n\nPalmer identifies a further area where SDVs could benefit fleets \u2013 rental vehicles.\n\n\u201cOne area I really see big potential for, but don\u2019t see any conversation about, is on the rental side,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cThe concept of features on demand \u2013 the idea of flexibly buying or accessing features for a short amount of time \u2013 surely makes sense for the rental sector.\n\n\u201cA customer could get a vehicle, upload their profile and then have all the features they want to use: this sounds like a fantastic use case.\u201d\n\nGartner says the introduction of SDVs will also eventually lead to a new market for car hardware upgrades as eventually \u2013 and as with smartphones and computers \u2013 there will come a point when an SDV\u2019s factory-installed computing hardware will not be able to cope with in-life software advancements.\n\nOn average, a passenger car\u2019s useful life is around 12 years in the US and Europe, it says, and this will increase given the greater longevity of electric vehicles.\n\nThis means the widespread adoption of the zero-emission technology will bring a major long-term drop in the revenue from new car sales and aftersales for OEMs.\n\nHowever, easy and price-competitive vehicle hardware updates will allow OEMs to keep selling new digital features/services to the owner to replace this lost revenue, as well as extending an SDV\u2019s useful life.\n\nIn today's rapidly changing world, fleet managers aren't just managing vehicles\u2014they're leading critical conversations about strategy, sustainability, and efficiency. And whether you realise it or not, you are at the centre of key decisions that shape your business.\n\nYou play a pivotal role where finance, HR, operations, and procurement meet, ensuring cost efficiency, legal compliance, and CSR efforts are realised. Fleet managers are at the heart of driving business success.\n\nOur latest special report on \u201cFleet Leadership\u201d is packed with insights and strategies to help you become a standout leader in your organisation.
