The rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa\n\nHe has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansj\u00fcrgen K\u00f6hler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (CENAP), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says K\u00f6hler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office CENAP.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nAccording to its director, CENAP has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, K\u00f6hler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact for observers of the inexplicable\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, K\u00f6hler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe founded CENAP as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand.\"\n\nThe organization, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to CENAP has changed dramatically over the decades, K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese Lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nNumber of reports spike thanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organization recorded over 850 cases by October 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups - rocket ignitions - in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun,\" K\u00f6hler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, CENAP records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nThe organization also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the CENAP director.\n\nDo only conspiracy theorists report UFO sightings?\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, K\u00f6hler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship ... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nK\u00f6hler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organization is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nK\u00f6hler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life - or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth.\"\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\"\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa"

            "article_content": "The skies above New Jersey are teeming with mysteries. Strange lights. Flying objects. Thousands of eyewitnesses. They want to believe\u2026 but the truth? The truth is boring.\n\nPlanes, Planes Everywhere\n\n\n\nThe Lights That Deceived Us All\n\n\n\nBut My Flight App Said It Wasn\u2019t a Plane!\n\n\n\nStill, Some Mysteries Remain\u2026\n\n\n\nThe Truth Is Boring\n\n\n\nWelcome to the great New Jersey drone panic of 2024.It all started innocently enough in November, when Morris County residents began spotting strange, brightly lit objects zipping through the night sky. Videos flooded social media. Theories spread faster than free pizza in an office break room. Were they drones? Secret government tech? Aliens? By December, sightings were popping up across several states, and people were convinced that something big was happening.Spoiler alert: it wasn\u2019t.Turns out, all that mystery boiled down to one simple explanation \u2013 planes.Northern New Jersey doesn\u2019t just have busy roads; it\u2019s got airways that are practically bumper-to-bumper. Between major hubs like Newark Liberty and smaller airstrips, this patch of sky sees over 2,500 flights on a regular basis. That\u2019s everything from jumbo jets to tiny helicopters, all lit up like Christmas trees.But to the human eye, especially at night, those lights can do a number on your perception. What looks like a drone buzzing low to the ground might actually be a commercial flight cruising at 5,000 feet. In one viral video, an object people swore was a drone turned out to be a United Airlines flight miles above. Another \u201chovering UFO\u201d over Morris County? Just a regular passenger jet doing its thing.Here\u2019s the thing about aircraft: they have rules about lights. The FAA says planes need red and green navigation lights, white strobes, and landing lights. Drones? They only need one light visible from three miles away.Most of the sightings in New Jersey didn\u2019t even match drone lighting patterns. Instead, they looked suspiciously like the FAA-required setup for planes and helicopters. Yet somehow, people were seeing extraterrestrial invaders instead of your garden-variety airliner.Ah, yes, the trusty flight-tracking apps. Many amateur sleuths whipped these out, scanning the skies and declaring anything not on their screens as \u201cdefinitely a drone.\u201d Here\u2019s the problem: flight apps don\u2019t track everything. Smaller planes, older aircraft, and certain government missions can slip through the cracks. So just because it\u2019s not on your app doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not up there.Even New Jersey Senator Andy Kim fell for it. After a night chasing lights with local police, he tweeted concerns about America\u2019s drone detection capabilities . The next day? He backtracked, admitting most of what he saw were likely planes.For the die-hard conspiracy theorists, don\u2019t worry \u2013 not everything\u2019s been explained. The FBI has received over 5,000 drone-related tips nationwide, though most turned out to be planes or legal drones. Only about 100 sightings still have investigators scratching their heads.But here\u2019s the kicker: the FBI and FAA insist there\u2019s no threat to public safety. Still, the FAA slapped a temporary ban on drones flying over parts of New Jersey, probably to give everyone a breather from the hysteria.At the end of the day, what we\u2019re left with isn\u2019t a sci-fi saga or a covert government operation. It\u2019s just New Jersey\u2019s impossibly busy airspace doing what it does best: confusing the hell out of everyone.So next time you see strange lights overhead, remember: the skies aren\u2019t full of secrets. They\u2019re full of planes."

            "article_content": "NEW YORK, Dec. 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumary, an innovator in smart lighting and smart home technology, will make its in-person debut at CES 2025, showcasing its creative products: the Permanent Outdoor Light Max, UFO High Bay Light, and the Next-Generation 4-Zone Solar Watering Timer. These industry-first products, developed based on market demand forecasts, mark Lumary's entry into various segments of the smart home industry. During the event, Lumary will exhibit at the Lumary CES Experience Center, located at Booth #40548 in the South Hall 3.\n\nLumary CES 2025\n\nThe Redesigned Permanent Outdoor Light Max Simplifies Installation and Enhances Nighttime Illumination.\n\nFollowing the success of Lumary's first-generation permanent outdoor light on Amazon in 2023, Lumary developed the new permanent outdoor light max based on user feedback. The latest model features a split design, innovatively separating the base from the light body. Installation is as simple as securing the base under the eaves and sliding the light body into place. Additionally, the LED beads have been upgraded, with reduced spacing between them, resulting in significantly increased brightness and a more vibrant decorative ambiance at night.\n\nIndustry-First Smart UFO High Bay Light: Simplifying Complex Wiring and Enabling Group Control for Workspaces\n\nLumary introduces the concept of smart lighting to traditional UFO high bay light, addressing the challenges of complex wiring and lack of centralized control in workspaces like garages, workshops, warehouses, and barns. With the Lumary App and remote control, users can easily configure and flexibly group lights, allowing groupings to be customized, split, or reorganized based on different task requirements.\n\nEquipped with a three-level motion sensor, the product enhances workspace safety while optimizing energy and time savings. The sensor detects motion up to 60 feet away, eliminating the need for manual switches, and offers adjustable illumination times ranging from 5 seconds to 60 minutes.\n\nIndustry-First Four-Zone Solar-Powered Smart Watering Timer: Revolutionizing Home Garden Watering\n\nFollowing the launch of its first battery-powered smart irrigation system in April 2024, Lumary has further enhanced the user experience with the introduction of a Wi-Fi direct connection version, eliminating the need for a Bluetooth gateway. The new Wi-Fi module features low-power design, with energy consumption as low as 400\u03bcA/h.\n\nThe system is equipped with an adjustable solar panel and two 4V 550F super capacitors, significantly extending its battery life (with a lifespan of up to 50,000 hours). Additionally, a highly requested water usage monitoring feature has been added, offering more intelligent management for home garden irrigation.\n\nStory Continues"

She claims while making food for her children, objects flew out of the cupboard she opened.\n\nMs Stokes said she contacted the previous occupant of the house, who wrote them a letter the applicant described as \u201cbeyond traumatic\u201d. She claimed she brought the letter to the attention of the council but was \u201claughed at\u201d in a meeting. She said: \u201cEveryone deserves a home. I never asked for a mansion, I asked for a safe home for my kids.\n\n\u201cI just want somewhere safe for my kids five days before Christmas,\u201d the Irish Mirror reported.\n\nThe High Court heard how the mould in the first property was so bad the entire family had to sleep downstairs instead of their bedrooms. They also had to make several hospital visits. The couple claim in the five years they lived in the property, the problem with mould became so bad that they were forced to leave and live temporarily with relatives before returning to the house.\n\nThe court heard the council placed the family on a transfer list and the offer of a new property was accepted by the Stokes in October. At the High Court Mr Justice Simons struck out the Stokes\u2019 claim against Leitrim County Council.\n\nMr Justice Simons said the claim before him only related to the first property and that if there were new claims, they would have to be lodged separately with the court. Mr Justice Simons said the only case before him was in relation to the first house and \u201cthe case has come and gone, as it were\u201d due to the Stokes' transferring to the new house.\n\nHe told Ms Stokes he understood her concern about the second house experiencing \"paranormal activity\" and her fears for the safety of her children but a third house would mean a new application to the local authority."

            "article_content": "In early October, Metal Gear Solid creator and friend of every celebrity alive Hideo Kojima posted that he'd watched and enjoyed the debut of Dan Da Dan, the anime adaptation of Yukinobu Tatsu's terrific manga. This isn't out of the ordinary, as Kojima is pretty fond of liberally posting about all of the media that he likes. And when he praised the seventh episode, at the time the best episode so far in a long string of 'best episodes so far', it affirmed that Dan Da Dan is a series that you shouldn't miss.\n\nHowever, the power of Dan Da Dan lies in something that might not be apparent at first. In fact, much of the strength of the series comes from it undermining any expectations that you might have.\n\nDan Da Dan tells the story of two teens, the sheepish Ken Takakura, aka \"Okarun\", who is fascinated by aliens and the paranormal, and the outspoken Momo Ayase who, thanks in part to her spirit medium grandmother, is invested in the supernatural.\n\nNeither is convinced about the other's obsessions, and so when Takakura goes to investigate a \"haunted\" tunnel, he becomes possessed by a spirit there. Meanwhile, Ayase is abducted by perverse aliens, an encounter that awakens her psychokinetic powers. Working together, the two begin to take on all manner of fantastical enemies, all while navigating their own burgeoning romantic feelings.\n\nUnusual usual\n\n(Image credit: \u00a9Yukinobu Tatsu/SHUEISHA, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\n'People taking on sci-fi monsters while blushing around one another' is certainly not uncharted territory, and it would be easy for Dan Da Dan to operate on a level of simple escapism. But few anime have been able to filter all this through pure, effective teenage angst quite like Dan Da Dan. Ayase, like most teens, fears being an outsider, and still reckons with childhood memories of being treated like one thanks to her grandmother's metaphysical mandates.\n\nTakakura, on the other hand, soon discovers that his genitals have been stolen by Turbo Granny, the spirit that lurks within him (yes, really). And so the typical hyper-awareness that one has about themselves during this stage in your life is magnified tenfold for the eternally anxious Takakura. It doesn't help that many of the creatures and spirits prod and taunt Takakura and Ayase about these things, exposing all of the little insecurities that even regular teenagers struggle to hide.\n\nDan Da Dan is also beautifully animated and bears stellar character and creature designs (courtesy of anime veteran Naoyuki Onda), some of which reflect traditional Japanese yokai and a host of otherworldly beasts. These foes are outsized, monstrous, and come loaded with their own eccentricities, but just when you feel caught up in the adrenaline of seeing a spirit-filled Takakura take on one of them in a high-speed contest, you're hit with the gut punch of what lies under the quirks.\n\nSign up for the Total Film Newsletter Bringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nMany of these foes, from Turbo Granny, whose spirit tends to the souls of young women who died under horrific circumstances, to Acrobatic Silky, a yokai who desperately searches for the child that was once taken from her when she was alive, generate profound sympathy. The latter was even treated to a beautiful tearjerker of an extended flashback that showed her attempts to give her daughter the best life possible despite their circumstances.\n\nBittersweet victory\n\n(Image credit: Netflix)\n\nAs such, their defeat is rarely a triumphant 'boss fight' event, but instead a bittersweet denouement to a tragic afterlife. Even human characters that initially emerge as one-note bullies, like pink-haired Aira Shiratori, are revealed to be grappling with something personal. Aira, for instance, lost her mother at a young age, and much of her imperious personality comes from her search for a purpose.\n\nDan Da Dan continuously shows us that it has heart. Takakura and Ayase bicker constantly in will-they/won't-they fashion, and it's common in lesser anime for relationships to subsist entirely on this type of repartee. But the pair are also constantly worried about one another. From the beginning, there's genuine care shown for each other's emotional upkeep, something that they've taken upon themselves even if the other person is still, in the grand scheme of things, a stranger. They're not teaming up to save the world (though they do want to get Takakura's privates returned to him) \u2013 they're teaming up because they've formed a genuine connection. In their cliquish school setting, that's pretty rare.\n\nIt's easy to imagine the kind of story that Dan Da Dan could've been, one that milks nothing but fan service out of Takakura and Ayase's relationship, one that presents new creatures for the sole purpose of their explosive defeats, and one that ignores any weighty themes about growing up and teenage paranoia in favor of purely digestible escapades. But Dan Da Dan rarely takes the easy route. Instead, it's consistently thoughtful in a way that has turned each episode into not just a fun weekly occurrence, but an outright event. Combine that with a production that is hitting all the right notes, and you have an anime that's bound to surprise you regardless of whether you've read the manga or not.\n\nDan Da Dan is set to return for season 2 in July 2025. While we wait, you can read everything we know about Dan Da Dan season 2."

            "article_content": "In a recent chat with YouTube channel RichardMetalFan (posted on Dec. 13), Shadows Fall drummer Jason Bittner revealed why he \u201chated\u201d both Metallica and Slayer when he first heard them (and what led to him changing his mind).\n\nBittner\u2019s Discovery of Heavy Metal\n\nAt the start of their conversation, Bittner is asked, \u201cGrowing up, what were the first band that got you into metal and made you want to start playing drums?\u201d\n\nBittner responds:\n\nThe band that got me into \u201cheavy metal,\u201d technically, is Iron Maiden. Maiden\u2019s my favorite metal band of all time as well. That was the first band I saw of that genre in 1980, the day that MTV came on the air. I was 10 years old, and I was, like, \u201cWhat in God's name is this?\u201d And that just sent me on my trajectory [with] Maiden and Judas Priest.\n\nAside from Bittner\u2019s minor timeline mistake (MTV debuted in 1981), his love for Iron Maiden and Judas Priest isn\u2019t surprising. What is more shocking, however, is that he follows by confessing that he was far less impressed by Metallica and Slayer when he first heard them.\n\n\u201cI wanna say, I think [in] \u201984, a friend of mine let me borrow a record [Ride the Lightning],\u201d Bittner reflects. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you gotta check out this band.' And I'm, like, 'Who's Metal-licka?' And he goes, 'No, it's pronounced Metallica, man!' I'm, like, 'All right, cool. Metallica.\u2019 And I took it home and I hated it.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Shadows Fall Vs. Haunted Prison\n\nWhy Bittner Originally Didn\u2019t Like Metallica or Slayer\n\nInterestingly, it\u2019s related to his love for Bruce Dickinson and Rob Halford. Bittner explains:\n\nI was like, \u201cGod, what the hell is this?\u201d 'Cause I was used to Bruce Dickinson and Halford, and all of a sudden, you have James Hetfield, and I'm, like, \u201cWhat on earth is this?\u201d Maybe, like, a week later, I taped the album just in case I might like it one day, and I gave the record back to my friend. And, like, a week later, I'm doing my paper route and I was humming [a guitar riff]. And I'm, like, \u201cWhat is this that I'm singing to myself?\u201d And it was the riff from \u201cFight Fire With Fire.\u201d And I'm, like, \u201cOh, that's that Metallica band. I didn't think I liked that.\u201d\n\nHe continues:\n\nA lot of the heavier bands \u2013 even bands I've been in \u2013 when I've heard [them] the first time, I didn't care for [them]. Like Slayer. I hated Slayer at first. I'm, like, \u201cNo way I'm gonna like this.\u201d [Now] Slayer\u2019s my favorite thrash band of all time. Anthrax and Megadeth were the only two that, when I first listened, I wasn't, like, \u201cAargh!\u201d Like, with Anthrax, I was just, like, \u201cHoly shit!\u201d That was, like, the \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 the \u201cbe all, end all\u201d for me right there, because [drummer] Charlie [Benante] was . . . one step beyond [Slayer drummer Dave] Lombardo for me at that point, because, like, Lombardo was feet, but Charlie was the whole fucking package.\n\nWhat Made Him Change His Mind on Metallica and Slayer\n\nBittner add that he was introduced to Metallica first (followed by Megadeth) because a classmate mentioned that \u201cthere\u2019s this dude [Dave Mustaine] that was in Metallica before Kirk Hammett.\u201d\n\nHe explains:\n\nI didn't know about anything pre-'Kill \u2018Em All' . . . [and] he was, like, \u201cNah, this dude [Mustaine] was in the band before [Hammett], and he's got this other band and it's called Megadeth. . . And the first thing I heard was 'Killing Is My Business,' but that was so raw at the time. I was, like, \u201cAll right . . . it's kind of cool. It's fast and stuff.\u201d But, once 'Peace Sells' came out, I was, like, \u201cOh, all right. Now I get it.\u201d . . . Maybe a year after that or within that year, I got into Slayer. A friend of mine had Show No Mercy and he had let me hear that. And I wasn't really that impressed, but then Reign in Blood came out . . . and I bought that . . . went on a spring break vacation my sophomore year of high school to Florida with my mom, and all I did was just I had Reign In Blood . . . I listened to that record just incessantly for a week straight.\n\nFrom there, Bittner came to appreciate \u201chow hard thrash metal drumming was\u201d as he tried to play certain parts himself. \u201cSo, it was Slayer, then Anthrax, and it was basically through the \u201cBig 4\u201d and then everything else under the sun,\u201d he remarks.\n\nInterestingly, he admits that he\u2019s \u201calways been . . . a thrash metal drummer,\u201d adding:\n\nI\u2019m not an extreme metal drummer. I like that stuff, but . . . it's out of my wheelhouse. It's not what I do. But I like a lot of those drummers and went through that whole phase in the mid-'90s. [I was] immersed into Death and Morbid Angel and that stuff. Listening to Pete Sandoval and Sean Reinert and Gene Hoglan. So, my influences go across the board, really. And let's not forget Van Halen, either.\n\nThat\u2019s quite the musical journey, right?\n\nOf course, Shadows Fall recently released a new single and music video, \u201cIn the Grey,\u201d which marks their first piece of new music in over a decade. It also signifies their new partnership with MNRK Music Group.\n\nAs for Metallica, they were ranked no. 9 in Pollstar\u2019s recent tally of the Top 10 Worldwide Top Touring Artists of 2024. Likewise, they remain one of the top ten most popular choices for tattoos, and Kyuss\u2019 Brant Bjork acknowledged that he didn\u2019t like having the band labeled as \u201cthe next Metallica.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Slayer\u2019s Kerry King cited Sabotage as his favorite Black Sabbath LP.\n\nAlso, you can watch the full interview with Bittner below:\n\nShadows Fall\u2019s Jason Bittner Discusses His Musical History With RichardMetalFan"

            "article_content": "Terrifying night time phenomenon makes body freeze and 1 in 3 of us will experience it\n\nNight-time disturbances of the terrifying variety can make us believe in the paranormal.\n\nBut those of us unlucky enough to \"wake\" to the feeling we aren't alone or find our bodies suddenly at the mercy of mysterious forces will be relieved to hear that these phenomena have a scientific name and explanation.\n\nThe Sleep Foundation describes sleep paralysis as a \"temporary inability to move or speak that occurs directly after falling asleep or waking up\". During an episode, the boundaries of sleep and wakefulness \u2013 usually defined and distinct \u2013 are temporarily blurred, leading to a mixed state of consciousness wherein individuals maintain some degree of awareness, however distorted, of the world around them, while being unable to move.\n\nOrdinarily, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep combines vivid dreaming with atonia (the brief loss of muscle control), which works in our favour to prevent us acting out our dreams in real life. Sleep paralysis, on the other hand, seems to occur when the atonia and mental imagery of REM sleep persists even into a state of being aware and awake.\n\nMedical experts have grouped sleep paralysis into two categories. Isolated sleep paralysis, or one-off paralysis episodes that are not connected to an underlying diagnosis of narcolepsy (a neurological disorder that disrupts the ability of the brain to properly control wakefulness).\n\nRecurrent sleep paralysis, or multiple sleep paralysis episodes over time that are usually associated with narcolepsy.\n\nAround 75% of sleep paralysis episodes involve hallucinations. These can include intruder hallucinations, where the individual perceives a dangerous person or presence in the room; chest pressure hallucinations (also known as incubus hallucinations), which involve feelings of suffocation and often occur alongside intruder hallucinations; and vestibular-motor (V-M) hallucinations, which involve feelings of movement or out-of-body sensations.\n\nThe cause of sleep paralysis is not fully understood, but it has been associated with insomnia, disrupted sleep patterns, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and a family history of sleep paralysis. .\n\nTo prevent sleep paralysis, there are no quick-fixes or guaranteed cures, but some suggestions include: regularly getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep every day; maintaining a consistent bedtime and wake-up time; engaging in regular exercise, but avoiding it in the four hours leading up to bedtime; and sleeping on your front or side, as sleeping on your back can increase the likelihood of sleep paralysis episodes. .\n\nThose who are struggling with recurrent sleep paralysis may be referred to their GP, who could identify an underlying condition such as insomnia or PTSD. They may also be referred to a clinician who specialises in sleep disorders."

            "article_content": "In everyday life, when things turn out the opposite of what you expect, it's usually cause for frustration. In science, it's often the starting point for discovery.\n\nThat's what happened to a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and their collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Their unexpected findings in the lab point to an opportunity to improve therapies that use small RNAs to silence disease-causing genes, potentially including those involved in cancer.\n\nSometimes you do an experiment. You think you're testing one idea, but when it doesn't turn out the way you planned, it can lead you to find something else that's much more interesting.\" Eric Lai, PhD, developmental biologist\n\nIn this case, the researchers -; led by Seungjae Lee, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Lai Lab at MSK's Sloan Kettering Institute -; were testing how a protein called ALAS1 helps to make small regulatory RNAs called microRNAs. When they removed the protein from cells, they expected to see levels of microRNAs drop.\n\n\"But instead, we were surprised to see them increase,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nThat counterintuitive result led to the discovery of an unrecognized role for ALAS1 beyond its well-known role in the production of heme. (Heme is an important player in many biological processes, including in oxygen transport -; giving hemoglobin its name -; in energy production, and in making microRNAs.)\n\nThe team's findings were published in Science, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals.\n\nHow little RNA snippets silence genes\n\nBoth microRNAs and the related class of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small snippets of RNA -; just 21 or 22 nucleotides long -; that bind to specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and repress them.\n\nThere's a bucket brigade of players that together convert longer RNA molecules into the tiny active products, and a key takeaway is that scientists have harnessed this knowledge to turn small RNAs into drugs that can silence genes that cause specific diseases.\n\nThe first siRNA drug, patisiran, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 to treat a debilitating genetic disorder called hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. A handful of additional siRNA drugs have been approved since, with more moving their way through clinical trials. Doctors see great potential to develop siRNA medicines against both rare diseases and more common ones (siRNA drugs are sometimes called RNAi drugs, meaning they work by interfering with messenger RNA accumulation).\n\nA moonlighting enzyme\n\nBack in the Lai Lab, Dr. Lee had discovered that upon removing ALAS1 from cells, they made more microRNAs. And further experiments showed that removing any of the other enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway did not affect microRNA levels.\n\n\"This told us that ALAS1 has another job outside of helping to make heme, which no one had realized,\" Dr. Lee says.\n\n\"We can consider this a 'moonlighting' function,\" Dr. Lai adds. \"And here we discovered that ALAS1 has this secret role regulating microRNAs that's not connected to its normal role in heme synthesis.\"\n\nPotential to make siRNA drugs work better\n\nThe discovery led the MSK researchers to partner with colleagues from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who specialize in heme regulation and ALAS genes -; Makiko Yasuda, MD, PhD, Robert Desnick MD, PhD, and postdoctoral fellow Sangmi Lee, PhD. This allowed the MSK researchers to extend their findings from cell culture into custom animal models that the Mount Sinai group were developing.\n\nAnd in mice, again, removing ALAS (specifically in liver cells) led to a global increase in microRNAs.\n\n\"The emerging picture is that ALAS acts as a brake on the production of microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"So we thought, now that we know how to remove this brake, maybe we can use that to improve the efficacy of siRNA drugs and their ability to silence their target genes.\"\n\nIn theory, this knowledge might help boost the activity of siRNA drugs against any problematic gene that is overactive in disease, Dr. Lai explains. Potentially this could include oncogenes known to drive cancer.\n\n\"But we're not quite there yet,\" he says. \"Therapeutic siRNA drugs don't work well enough against all targets and are currently limited in where they can be used in the body.\" In fact, all six of the FDA-approved siRNA drugs target hepatocytes in the liver.\n\n\"It's straightforward to get drugs into the liver, which serves as a filter for the body,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nSo, as a proof-of-concept, the team showed that not only could they deplete mouse liver cells of ALAS, leading to an increase in microRNAs, but doing so also enhanced the silencing activity of another model siRNA compound delivered to the mice.\n\nCoincidentally, one of the six approved siRNA drugs turns off ALAS1 to treat acute hepatic porphyrias. Dr. Yasuda and Dr. Desnick worked on the preclinical and clinical trials for the drug, which is known as givosiran. Since an siRNA against ALAS1 works effectively and safely in humans, this raises the possibility of combining such an agent to enhance other siRNA drugs. Dr. Lai notes that this strategy could be generally applicable to any siRNA.\n\nAnd if siRNA drugs can be made to work better, this could improve their cost-effectiveness, reduce side effects by making them effective at lower doses, and perhaps help to target additional cell types beyond liver cells, he adds.\n\nWhy discovery science matters\n\nIn December 2024, Harvard geneticist Gary Ruvkun, PhD, was awarded the Nobel Prize with Victor Ambros, PhD, for their joint discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation in the early 1990s. Dr. Lai did his undergraduate thesis research in Dr. Ruvkun's lab at that time (on another class of gene regulator) and credits him for launching his own career.\n\n\"I got my first real exposure to how science was actually done and gained lifelong interests in developmental biology and small RNAs,\" Dr. Lai says, adding that his mentor's recent accolade underscores the importance of curiosity-driven research.\n\n\"Dr. Ruvkun didn't start out looking for microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"Like Dr. Ambros, he was investigating the development of nematodes, these tiny worms that live in the soil. And not only did this unveil an entirely new paradigm for how genes are controlled, the field they started eventually resulted in a novel class of human therapies.\n\n\"When people ask why we're not spending all of our research dollars directly studying diseases like cancer, why we're funding research into cells and processes in model organisms like fruit flies, yeast, and bacteria -; this is a great example of how discovery science fuels the biggest breakthroughs,\" he continues. \"And I think it is especially critical to keep this conversation active, given how much uncertainty and disagreement there is in society and government about how much to publicly fund scientific research and in what areas. Hopefully, there will be continued support to keep the engine of foundational research strong.\"\n\nFunding and disclosures\n\nFunding for the research includes grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01DK134783, R01-GM083300, P30-CA008748); a Cooperative Centers of Excellence in Hematology pilot grant (10040500-05S1); and a NYSTEM training award (C32559GG).\n\nThe researchers have filed a patent application on their methods for enhancing the efficacy of RNAi therapy by targeting ALAS1/ALAS2 (WO2024148236A1).\n\nDrs. Yasuda and Desnick are also co-inventors of a patent for RNAi therapy of acute hepatic porphyrias. They also report pharmaceutical consulting work. Please see the study for full details."

A study in Science Advances reveals 6.2 trillion tons of hydrogen trapped underground. This discovery could meet energy demands for 200 years.\n\nThe study, titled \"Model Predictions of Global Geologic Hydrogen Resources,\" was published on December 13. It estimates the hydrogen reserve to be 26 times larger than known oil deposits. Despite this, the exact locations of these reserves remain unknown.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHydrogen, a light and abundant element, shows immense energy potential. Governments are exploring it as a cleaner alternative to oil and gas. According to the study, hydrogen may meet 30 per cent of energy needs by 2050. Demand is projected to grow fivefold within three decades.\n\nRead Also: Asteroid alert for Christmas Eve: 120-foot asteroid to zoom past Earth at alarming speed, confirms NASA\n\n\"The global hydrogen demand could hit 500 Mt yearly by 2050,\" the study noted. \"Extracting just 2% of this reserve would satisfy demands for 200 years.\"\n\nPrevious Assumptions Challenged\n\nFor years, experts believed hydrogen escaped through rock pores. The study challenges this notion with evidence of underground reservoirs. Examples include discoveries in Albanian chromium mines and West Africa.\n\nGeoffrey Ellis, lead author and a US Geological Survey geochemist, told Live Science, \"The findings surprised us. There\u2019s more hydrogen than we imagined.\" He added, \"We don\u2019t need external energy sources; it\u2019s stored underground.\"\n\nA Promising Energy Shift\n\nHydrogen is gaining traction for its potential to replace fossil fuels. Unlike blue or green hydrogen, natural hydrogen doesn\u2019t require additional energy or storage solutions.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nRead Also: New study reveals Moon's actual age, saying it is 100 million years older than previously thought\n\nEllis emphasised, \"Storage isn\u2019t an issue with natural hydrogen reservoirs.\" However, the primary challenge remains economic feasibility. Developing cost-effective extraction methods is vital to attract investment.\n\nThe discovery brings optimism but requires further exploration. Scientists must locate reserves and address technical challenges. This development could mark a pivotal step in global energy evolution."

            "article_content": "The New York Times made headlines by suing OpenAI this year, but the case against AI isn't so black and white\n\nWhen you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Rael Hornby\n\nOn April 30, 2024, eight of the nation's largest daily newspapers, including the New York Times, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming both companies used news articles without permission to train their AI models.\n\nIt's among the most significant cases launched against AI developers to date and follows a separate, ongoing lawsuit filed on December 27, 2023, in which the New York Times claimed OpenAI committed copyright infringement through ChatGPT.\n\nWhen I asked ChatGPT about these cases, it dutifully gave me a summary of the 2023 case, including three main points: copyright infringement, a lack of compensation for using copyrighted content, and the ongoing nature of the case.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIronically, in explaining this case to me, ChatGPT may have pulled from New York Times articles, highlighting the exact issue at hand \u2014 or, at the very least, the issue that the newspaper has.\n\nBut is this case as black and white as The Times' own masthead? Given that its outcome could determine how companies handle the training of future models for potentially decades to come, it's worth taking a closer look.\n\n#9 in Laptop Mag's Biggest AI Moments of 2024\n\nThis article ranks at #9 in our round-up of the year's 24 most impactful moments in artificial intelligence. For the full rankings and more articles like this, check out the Biggest AI Moments of 2024 \u2014 a Laptop Mag Special Issue.\n\nA pressing matter: The case for The New York Times\n\nAt the time of writing, OpenAI is just one of several AI companies facing dozens of lawsuits. These cases often focus on some form of copyright infringement, with plaintiffs ranging from individual YouTube creators to media conglomerates and music studios.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen hearing about claims of copyright infringement by AI, musicians, actors, and writers may first come to mind. Hollywood has been at the center of tensions with the AI industry for years now, but the press and news outlets also play an important role in the battle against the misuse of AI.\n\nCases like the 2023 and 2024 New York Times lawsuits aren't just about protecting journalists from losing their jobs to AI. Unlike AI-related cases in Hollywood, these cases focus more on the exploitation of news articles by AI chatbots and the risks of those chatbots spreading misinformation under the guise of legitimate news sources.\n\nThe possibility of generative AI fabricating news isn't hypothetical, either. It's already happening. For example, in 2023, The Guardian blocked ChatGPT from scraping its website for training data after readers reported that the chatbot was generating news articles under Guardian reporters' bylines... that those reporters never actually wrote.\n\nSimilarly, the 2024 New York Times lawsuit against AI cited multiple examples of ChatGPT generating false product recommendations attributed to news outlets.\n\nThis completely fabricated information isn't just an inconvenient AI blunder. It may cause serious harm to readers who believe they're getting information from a trustworthy source. As the lawsuits claim, this can also damage newspapers' reputations if unsuspecting readers don't realize they're getting a recommendation or story that's completely made up.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, these lawsuits also raise the issue of lost revenue. It's no secret that newspapers rely on paid subscriptions to stay in business. AI models can give readers access to text from copyrighted news articles without paying for access to that content. So, the New York Times and the other news outlets joining it in the 2024 lawsuit claim they are owed compensation for OpenAI's use of their content.\n\nWhat all of this amounts to is a question of accountability. Can AI companies profit off of content they weren't authorized to use? Are they responsible for the damage done when their algorithms generate false or misleading content?\n\nGenerating headlines: The case for OpenAI\n\nThe Times' argument is sound enough, but as with any lawsuit, there are two sides to every story.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn response to the lawsuit filing, OpenAI would accuse The Times of incomplete reporting in a post titled OpenAI and Journalism published on their website in January 2024, stating \"We support journalism, partner with news organizations, and believe the New York Times lawsuit is without merit.\"\n\nOn the topic of copyrighted works appearing within ChatGPT, OpenAI offered insight claiming, \"[The New York Times] had mentioned seeing some regurgitation of their content but repeatedly refused to share any examples, despite our commitment to investigate and fix any issues.\"\n\nExploring these \"regurgitations,\" the name given to a bug encountered by OpenAI's models when it offers up training data as part of an answer, further, Open AI states \"Interestingly, the regurgitations The New York Times induced appear to be from years-old articles that have proliferated on multiple third-party websites.\n\n\"It seems they intentionally manipulated prompts, often including lengthy excerpts of articles, in order to get our model to regurgitate.\"\n\nFrom OpenAI's perspective, The Times' claims result from attempted \"jailbreaking\" efforts to force ChatGPT to reveal training data. As the company puts it, \"this misuse is not typical or allowed user activity ... we are continually making our systems more resistant to adversarial attacks to regurgitate training data, and have already made much progress in our recent models.\"\n\nReinforcing his company's stance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the lawsuit at the recent Dealbook Summit 2024 in December, stating \"I think the New York Times is on the wrong side of history in many ways.\"\n\nA case that's not so black and white\n\nIt's not just copyright infringement on the table in these landmark AI lawsuits \u2014 in cases of copyright infringement in particular, the outcomes could completely reshape the way AI models are trained in the future.\n\nTo some, LLMs like ChatGPT are simply spewing out pieces of pre-learned information to users, scraped from the training materials it was initially fed, raising alarm bells over how much of this \"new\" information contains another's work.\n\nHowever, AI developers claim that models such as ChatGPT don't work that way. To them, even if a model is trained on copyright-protected data, it's no different than somebody learning to play guitar by playing riffs from their favorite bands. If this person were to go on to create music of their own, they wouldn't be breaking copyright simply by having learned to do so by listening and learning to others who already could.\n\nThe jury is still out on which side of the argument will prevail in court, with both sides making strong cases.\n\nHowever, perhaps ChatGPT's excellence in delivering content that is so human-like will be its downfall, similar to the misunderstanding of the widely attributed Pablo Picasso quote (which, ironically, is also possibly misattributed): \"Good artists copy, great artists steal.\"\n\nIf you're anything from an AI enthusiast to the average AI tinkerer (or simply seeking out some of the additional features offered through Windows Copilot+ PCs or Apple Intelligence on Macs), then you'll need a powerful and performative laptop to keep up to speed with your needs.\n\nAt Laptop Mag, we review laptops year-round to ensure we're giving you expert-backed and up-to-date recommendations on which notebook is right for you.

            "article_content": "Trend: Sustainability\n\nThe South Korean government announced plans to mandate label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, replacing this with a digital QR code system over two years.\n\nSouth Korea has committed to a range of sustainability goals, including the slashing of plastic waste production by 50% and the doubling of recycling rates in the country from 34% to 70%, both by 2030.\n\nThe past few years have seen the Ministry of Environment (MoE) roll out a range of regulatory policies to this end, including the banning of hard-to-recycle plastics such as coloured PET from the recycling system as well as approving recycled PET plastic as material for new food packaging.\n\nThe ministry calling for public comment on another initiative earlier this year to mandate the use of label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, to be implemented after a two-year transition period.\n\n\u201cIn order to reduce the amount of label waste in the country from drinking water bottles and improve the efficiency of recycling systems locally, we will introduce a new label-free QR code system for all such bottles,\u201d MoE said via a formal statement.\n\nTrend: Sugar reduction\n\nThe Vietnamese government drafted regulations earlier this year proposing a phased increase on excise taxes for alcoholic beverages to 100% by 2030 as well as 10% for sugar-sweetened beverages, in attempts to curb overconsumption as well as boosting national income.\n\nVietnam is well-known for having very affordable alcoholic beverage prices, with beers in particular costing well below US$1 at most supermarkets and eateries.\n\nThe local government believes that such affordable prices have contributed to high consumption amongst consumers, and that it is now necessary to increase taxation on these drinks to ensure public health is not compromised.\n\n\u201cHigher taxation is necessary in order to reduce the consumption of alcohol in Vietnam,\u201d the local Ministry of Finance said via a formal statement outlining the draft regulations.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to gradually increase taxes to 100%, 70% and 100% eventually by 2030 \u2013 all of these are in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations to increase retail prices for alcohol by 10%.\u201d\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nThe general public and experts in Singapore raised several concerns over the consumption of cultivated meat, while also acknowledging it can play a crucial role in the City State\u2019s food security efforts.\n\nThese views were detailed in a study that aimed to investigate how both the public and experts perceive the risks and benefits of cultured meat on individual and societal levels.\n\nResearchers undertook four distinct online focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted between February and April 2022. Three FGDs involved participants from the general public, while the fourth included cultured meat experts. Each session, lasting approximately two hours, comprised nine to eleven participants.\n\nGiven Singapore\u2019s heavy reliance on imported food and its active promotion of novel food technology industries, including cultured meat, the market for such innovative foods is expanding, attracting more companies to the field.\n\nTrend: Viral trending product - Dubai Chocolate\n\nThe meteoric rise of FIX Dessert Chocolatier\u2019s chunky chocolate bars can be attributed to the growing influence of social media on purchasing decisions, exclusivity, and unique regional flavours, an analyst said earlier this year.\n\nFounded by Sarah Hamouda, the brand was launched in 2021 but only became viral this year \u2014 thanks to food influencer Maria Vehera, who filmed herself eating the chocolate bar and posted the video on TikTok, which garnered over 70 million views as of time of writing.\n\nSince then, people from all over the world shared their own reactions or tried to replicate the recipe at home, with the \u201cDubai chocolate fever\u201d spreading beyond the UAE to the US, Europe, and Asian countries like South Korea and Singapore.\n\nAccording to senior research analyst Monique Naval from Euromonitor International, this is the first time in recent years that a product from the Middle East has gained such global attention.\n\n\u201cWhile the Middle East has other unique chocolate offerings, such as chocolate-covered dates and camel chocolate, these have mostly been bought as souvenirs and their popularity have been rising organically over the years. In contrast, FIX\u2019s instant growth has been supported by social media and its limited production indicates exclusivity.\n\n\u201cThe increasing number of chocolatiers on social media has been driving consumer interest. With FIX\u2019s variety of filled chocolates going viral online, it showcases the growing influence of digital platforms in shaping modern confectionery trends,\u201d Naval told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nPlant-based dairy brands in India are continuing to steer away from using conventional dairy terms on their product labels until regulators issue greater clarity on what is permitted.\n\nBack in 2020 and 2021, the Food Safety and Standards Authority India (FSSAI) announced a ban on the use of conventional dairy terms such as \u2018milk\u2019 and \u2018cheese\u2019 for plant-based products. It also directed plant-based manufacturers to modify the product labels of all such products and e-commerce platforms to delist these as well.\n\nThis order was successfully stayed by the Delhi High Court later in 2021 after five companies took action. Despite this, industry uncertainty remains today.\n\n\u201cThe ban is essentially still a motion in hearing at the court level at this time,\u201d Rohit Jain, Co-Founder and CEO of Drums Food International which was one of the five companies that contributed to the initial ban being stayed, told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nTrend: Healthier innovations\n\nGlobal food and beverage giant Nestle had its eye on expanding its premium and healthy ageing product portfolios in search of a return to \u2018normalised\u2019 growth.\n\nNestle announced its FY2023 full year financial results, reporting a -1.5% year-on-year decrease in sales to CHF93bn (US$) but an increase of 17.3% in underlying trade operating profits to CHF16.1bn (US$).\n\nIn the firm\u2019s financial results press conference which FoodNavigator-Asia attended, Nestle CFO Francois-Xavier Roger highlighted that overall organic growth for the company has been estimated at a 7.2% growth year-on-year \u2013 but that this was made up of 7.5% pricing growth and -0.3% of what the company calls Real Internal Growth (RIG), which is a measurement of growth generated by volume and mix/innovation.\n\nAcknowledging this as an unsustainable means to long-term growth, Nestle CEO Mark Schneider told the floor that the firm was committed to move back to RIG-led growth in 2024, laying out several strategies towards this.\n\n\u201cThe food sector softness that has been seen over past two years globally has come from a food price increase spike that is the highest we have seen in some 50 years since 1973 to 1974, coming in at a 14.7% spike which is the highest since the 16.3% we saw back then,\u201d Schneider told us.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nPlant-based beverages may be considered suitable alternatives to their dairy counterparts but must overcome challenges related to flavour, consumer health, stability and nutrient dissolution, said researchers in Singapore, the UK and China.\n\nIn recent years, plant-based drinks have emerged as a diverse and popular choice, offering a range of nutritional benefits and catering to lactose-intolerant individuals, as well as vegans and vegetarians.\n\nNutrition-wise, plant-based drinks are said be a rich source of essential nutrients, including proteins, dietary fibre, fats, vitamins and minerals \u2014 beyond the calcium and protein associated with dairy milk.\n\nThese alternatives are typically derived from plant sources such as nuts, grains, legumes and seeds; examples include almond, soy, oat, rice and coconut drinks. Each variety usually has a unique flavour, texture, and nutritional composition, providing consumers with a broad array of choices to suit individual preferences and dietary needs.\n\nHowever, considerations such as amino acid profiles, digestibility and the presence of anti-nutritional factors should be taken into account.\n\nTrend: Sugar reduction\n\nMembers of the Philippines government called for regulations that would officially ban manufacturers from using added sugar as an ingredient in foods for young children aged three and below.\n\nSweetness and sugar features strongly in many Filipino foods and can be exemplified by one of the country\u2019s most popular desserts halo-halo, which is an amalgamation of various sweetened ingredients including pudding, ice cream, multiple sweetened beans and tubers, sweetened purple yam paste, jellies, cheese and more over crushed ice \u2013 and then commonly topped off with coconut milk, evaporated milk, syrups or sometimes even table sugar.\n\nThis culminated in the rapid rise of obesity and overweight individuals in the Philippines over the past two decades, according to the national science agency Department of Science and Technology (DOST)\n\nAs of 2022 some 27 million Filipinos were either overweight or obese, with the percentage of this having nearly doubled from 20.2% in 1998 to 36.6% in 2019. Even more alarmingly, similar findings were observed in the younger generation where adolescent obesity and overweight rates also nearly doubled from 4.9% in 2003 to 11.6% in 2018.\n\n\u201cRecent data has found that young Filipinos are at a greater risk of obesity, due to the consumption of food that is energy-dense and nutrient-poor, exacerbated by growing urbanisation and increased incomes,\u201d Senator Imee R. Marcos highlighted to the Senate earlier this year when tabling the bill calling for a ban on using added sugar in food products for young children.\n\n\u201cThe proposed bill seeks to ensure good nutrition, optimal child growth and development, and better health outcomes for children.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nSingapore cultivated seafood firm Umami Bioworks has highlighted its belief that strategic mergers are crucial to overcome doubts about the sector and achieve buy-in from major brands which can help the category scale-up.\n\nUmami Bioworks hit the news earlier this year for its merger with Shiok Meats, especially with both firms well-known for being cultivated seafood industry leaders and pioneers in their own right.\n\n\u201cThe M&A really came about when we saw that the market was unfortunately turning sour and sentiment was down during this trough of disillusionment period,\u201d Umami Bioworks CEO Mihir Pershad told FoodNavigator-Asia in an episode of our Food and Beverage Trailblazers podcast.\n\n\u201cWe know the market will come back once past this trough and that we will see recovery on the backside, but how good that recovery is and how long it will take is still to be seen so we needed to think about how to position the company to be in the best possible state to be the obvious choice for seafood industry incumbents to partner with both during this window and post-recovery.\n\nTrend: Alternative proteins\n\nThe Thai government has published draft regulations on governance over the alternative proteins industry starting with the plant-based sector, and has suggested banning certain animal-related terms but allowing others.\n\nThis announcement was made by the Thailand Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Food Division earlier this year, which also established a special project research team to analyse types of standards and criteria that the regulations need to cover for the greatest efficiency.\n\n\u201cAt present, alternative protein products are seeing popularity amongst consumers and there are many such items on the market, but the control and supervision of the safety aspect of these in Thailand still has no clear direction,\u201d the Thai FDA stated via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cWe are embarking on a study of the current production and imports of alternative protein products in the country, and studying the related regulations [to apply this knowledge] in the development of regulations and standards in Thailand.\n\n\u201cThis will start with analysis of the plant-based protein sector in Thailand [before moving to] other alternative proteins such as insect-based, cultivated meat or fermentation.\u201d"

This year proved no exception to the rule, either. In the last year, researchers discovered long-lost shipwrecks, odd animals, and even a phenomenon known as \u201cdark oxygen,\u201d among many other finds.\n\n\u2018Ghost Ship of the Pacific\u2019 found using underwater drones\n\nThe USS Stewart rests about 3,500 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface.

While Captain Frederick \u201cTatey Bug\u201d Burke insisted his crew stay the course, the sailors had other plans, and soon abandoned Burke to his\u2014and his ship\u2019s\u2014ultimate fate. Like the USS Stewart, the Arlington was located using remote operating submersibles and sonar scans.\n\nNew, colorful starfish species found off the coast of Japan\n\nThe newly discovered Paragonaster hoeimaruae.

Kobayashi\n\nThere are around 2,000 cataloged starfish species in the world, but that list grew by at least one new variety in 2024. Discovered by researchers off the coast of Japan\u2019s Izu Peninsula, Paragonaster hoeimaruae, is only the second starfish known to belong to the Pseudarchasteridae family. The strikingly orange sea creatures are especially adapted to live in muddy, sandy waters\u2014an evolutionary trait researchers hope to learn more about in the coming years.\n\nGrumpy-faced fish species found in Red Sea\n\nThe grumpy dwarfgoby is endemic to the Red Sea and lives in small holes and crevices in coral reefs. Viktor Nunes Peinemann\n\nWhile similarly as orange as Paragonaster hoeimaruae, Sueviota aethon arguably features a much more noticeable physical trait: the diminutive fish possesses a downturned mouth that makes it look permanently displeased. Its face seems so irritated that it even earned it the common name of the grumpy dwarfgoby. The roughly one inch long fish live among the coral reefs of the Red Sea\u2019s Farasan Banks near Saudi Arabia. Even at that size, however, discoverers describe the grumpy dwarfgoby as a \u201cfearsome predator\u201d given its comparatively large canines used to capture and devour small invertebrates.\n\nWWII submarine discovered 81 years after disappearing during secret mission\n\nThe HMS Trooper disappeared in 1943 with all 64 of its crew. Credit: YouTube / Planet Blue\n\nIt took at least as many as 14 attempts over nearly 25 years, but researchers finally located the wreckage of the HMS Trooper in 2024. The WWII Allied submarine and its 64 crew members deployed on a secret mission near Greece in early October 1943, but never arrived in Beirut as originally scheduled. Researchers used both sonar and an ROV called \u201cSuper Achille\u201d to identify Trooper\u2019s whereabouts, as well as confirm its fatal run-in with a German mine. Trooper lays in three separate parts an estimated 830-feet-deep at the bottom of the Icarian Sea, near the Greek island of Donoussa.\n\nWorld\u2019s largest coral formation is longer than a blue whale\n\nA diver from National Geographic Pristine Seas measures the world\u2019s largest coral colony in the Solomon Islands. Photograph by Manu San F\u00e9lix, National Geographic Pristine Seas\n\nThe biggest animal in the world may be the blue whale, but researchers in 2024 determined that the biggest intertwined community of animals is undoubtedly the recently discovered Pavona clavus coral colony. Measuring in at 111 feet wide, 104 feet long, 18 feet high, and 600 feet around, the standalone coral system formed in the southwest Pacific Ocean over the last 300 years, and can even be seen from space.\n\nNew ghost shark species found in New Zealand\n\nThe newly described Australasian narrow-nosed spookfish, Harriotta avia. National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA)\n\nGhost sharks, also known as \u201cspookfish,\u201d technically aren\u2019t sharks, but instead are a group of fish that are closely related to the ocean predators. One of the newest additions to the family this year was Harriotta avia, described as having an \u201celongated, narrow and depressed snout; long, slender trunk; large eyes; and very long, broad pectoral fins\u201d as well as possessing \u201clovely chocolate brown color.\u201d But don\u2019t expect to encounter one in the open waters\u2014Harriotta avia lives near New Zealand at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, roughly 8,350 feet below surface waters.\n\n\u2018Dark oxygen\u2019 on ocean floor may rewrite the origins of life\n\nThe formations can be found as deep as 20,000 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Wikipedia Commons\n\nOne of the wildest underwater discoveries of 2024 wasn\u2019t a new species of life, but chemical processes that might rewrite our understanding of the origins of life itself. Earlier this year, researchers published findings related to polymetallic nodules\u2014natural mineral deposits located on the pitch-black ocean floor. Despite lacking sunlight, however, evidence suggests these formations appear to function as \u201cgeobatteries\u201d capable of generating trace amounts of oxygen that help sustain deep-sea life. If true, then the planet\u2019s very first living organisms may have gotten their start in a place no one once thought could support life at all.\n\nNew jellyfish discovered near Japan may contain multitudes of venom\n\nThe St. George\u2019s Cross medusa is about four inches wide, three inches long, and has about 240 tentacles. Dhugal John Lindsay/JAMSTEC\n\nLike many other similar species, the newly found St. George\u2019s cross medusa lives around 2,300 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean, and hunts bioluminescent prey with its many tentacles. Unlike its relatives, however, Santjordia pagesi packs an \u201carsenal of venoms\u201d that differs from other known jellyfish. Unfortunately, it might take a little while before researchers start gleaning more information on the creature\u2014it\u2019s difficult to gather more specimens given the jellyfish lives in a deep-sea volcanic caldera about 285 miles south of Tokyo.\n\nResearchers discover neurological mechanism controlling anglerfish lures\n\nFrogfish belong to the larger anglerfish family, and use their front fin as a lure. Credit: Deposit Photos\n\nAnglerfish aren\u2019t a new find for researchers, but biologists did confirm a surprising evolutionary feature in the odd-looking animals this year. Using tracer analysis, a team discovered the exact motor neurons that control one of the subspecies\u2019 front dorsal fin lure. It appears the location of these motoneurons shifted during their evolution compared to their relatives, pointing to evolutionary implications that reach all the way to landwalking vertebrates.\n\nOver 100 possible new ocean species found near Chile\n\nDuring an expedition off the coasts of Chile and Rapa Nui, scientists spotted a bony Chaunacops fish swimming in the waters of Chile\u2019s Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park. Schmidt Ocean Institute\n\nThe 1,800-mile-long Salas y G\u00f3mez Ridge near Chile is home to some wild creatures that look like they just arrived from an alien planet. Earlier this year, researchers used a remote operated submersible to survey the region and documented over 100 candidates for never-before-seen species. These included crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and even marine mammals. Biologists also glimpsed extremely rare animals, such as the whiplash squid."

            "article_content": "In everyday life, when things turn out the opposite of what you expect, it's usually cause for frustration. In science, it's often the starting point for discovery.\n\nThat's what happened to a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and their collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Their unexpected findings in the lab point to an opportunity to improve therapies that use small RNAs to silence disease-causing genes, potentially including those involved in cancer.\n\nSometimes you do an experiment. You think you're testing one idea, but when it doesn't turn out the way you planned, it can lead you to find something else that's much more interesting.\" Eric Lai, PhD, developmental biologist\n\nIn this case, the researchers -; led by Seungjae Lee, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the Lai Lab at MSK's Sloan Kettering Institute -; were testing how a protein called ALAS1 helps to make small regulatory RNAs called microRNAs. When they removed the protein from cells, they expected to see levels of microRNAs drop.\n\n\"But instead, we were surprised to see them increase,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nThat counterintuitive result led to the discovery of an unrecognized role for ALAS1 beyond its well-known role in the production of heme. (Heme is an important player in many biological processes, including in oxygen transport -; giving hemoglobin its name -; in energy production, and in making microRNAs.)\n\nThe team's findings were published in Science, one of the world's most prestigious scientific journals.\n\nHow little RNA snippets silence genes\n\nBoth microRNAs and the related class of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small snippets of RNA -; just 21 or 22 nucleotides long -; that bind to specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and repress them.\n\nThere's a bucket brigade of players that together convert longer RNA molecules into the tiny active products, and a key takeaway is that scientists have harnessed this knowledge to turn small RNAs into drugs that can silence genes that cause specific diseases.\n\nThe first siRNA drug, patisiran, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 to treat a debilitating genetic disorder called hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. A handful of additional siRNA drugs have been approved since, with more moving their way through clinical trials. Doctors see great potential to develop siRNA medicines against both rare diseases and more common ones (siRNA drugs are sometimes called RNAi drugs, meaning they work by interfering with messenger RNA accumulation).\n\nA moonlighting enzyme\n\nBack in the Lai Lab, Dr. Lee had discovered that upon removing ALAS1 from cells, they made more microRNAs. And further experiments showed that removing any of the other enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway did not affect microRNA levels.\n\n\"This told us that ALAS1 has another job outside of helping to make heme, which no one had realized,\" Dr. Lee says.\n\n\"We can consider this a 'moonlighting' function,\" Dr. Lai adds. \"And here we discovered that ALAS1 has this secret role regulating microRNAs that's not connected to its normal role in heme synthesis.\"\n\nPotential to make siRNA drugs work better\n\nThe discovery led the MSK researchers to partner with colleagues from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who specialize in heme regulation and ALAS genes -; Makiko Yasuda, MD, PhD, Robert Desnick MD, PhD, and postdoctoral fellow Sangmi Lee, PhD. This allowed the MSK researchers to extend their findings from cell culture into custom animal models that the Mount Sinai group were developing.\n\nAnd in mice, again, removing ALAS (specifically in liver cells) led to a global increase in microRNAs.\n\n\"The emerging picture is that ALAS acts as a brake on the production of microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"So we thought, now that we know how to remove this brake, maybe we can use that to improve the efficacy of siRNA drugs and their ability to silence their target genes.\"\n\nIn theory, this knowledge might help boost the activity of siRNA drugs against any problematic gene that is overactive in disease, Dr. Lai explains. Potentially this could include oncogenes known to drive cancer.\n\n\"But we're not quite there yet,\" he says. \"Therapeutic siRNA drugs don't work well enough against all targets and are currently limited in where they can be used in the body.\" In fact, all six of the FDA-approved siRNA drugs target hepatocytes in the liver.\n\n\"It's straightforward to get drugs into the liver, which serves as a filter for the body,\" Dr. Lai says.\n\nSo, as a proof-of-concept, the team showed that not only could they deplete mouse liver cells of ALAS, leading to an increase in microRNAs, but doing so also enhanced the silencing activity of another model siRNA compound delivered to the mice.\n\nCoincidentally, one of the six approved siRNA drugs turns off ALAS1 to treat acute hepatic porphyrias. Dr. Yasuda and Dr. Desnick worked on the preclinical and clinical trials for the drug, which is known as givosiran. Since an siRNA against ALAS1 works effectively and safely in humans, this raises the possibility of combining such an agent to enhance other siRNA drugs. Dr. Lai notes that this strategy could be generally applicable to any siRNA.\n\nAnd if siRNA drugs can be made to work better, this could improve their cost-effectiveness, reduce side effects by making them effective at lower doses, and perhaps help to target additional cell types beyond liver cells, he adds.\n\nWhy discovery science matters\n\nIn December 2024, Harvard geneticist Gary Ruvkun, PhD, was awarded the Nobel Prize with Victor Ambros, PhD, for their joint discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation in the early 1990s. Dr. Lai did his undergraduate thesis research in Dr. Ruvkun's lab at that time (on another class of gene regulator) and credits him for launching his own career.\n\n\"I got my first real exposure to how science was actually done and gained lifelong interests in developmental biology and small RNAs,\" Dr. Lai says, adding that his mentor's recent accolade underscores the importance of curiosity-driven research.\n\n\"Dr. Ruvkun didn't start out looking for microRNAs,\" Dr. Lai says. \"Like Dr. Ambros, he was investigating the development of nematodes, these tiny worms that live in the soil. And not only did this unveil an entirely new paradigm for how genes are controlled, the field they started eventually resulted in a novel class of human therapies.\n\n\"When people ask why we're not spending all of our research dollars directly studying diseases like cancer, why we're funding research into cells and processes in model organisms like fruit flies, yeast, and bacteria -; this is a great example of how discovery science fuels the biggest breakthroughs,\" he continues. \"And I think it is especially critical to keep this conversation active, given how much uncertainty and disagreement there is in society and government about how much to publicly fund scientific research and in what areas. Hopefully, there will be continued support to keep the engine of foundational research strong.\"\n\nFunding and disclosures\n\nFunding for the research includes grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01DK134783, R01-GM083300, P30-CA008748); a Cooperative Centers of Excellence in Hematology pilot grant (10040500-05S1); and a NYSTEM training award (C32559GG).\n\nThe researchers have filed a patent application on their methods for enhancing the efficacy of RNAi therapy by targeting ALAS1/ALAS2 (WO2024148236A1).\n\nDrs. Yasuda and Desnick are also co-inventors of a patent for RNAi therapy of acute hepatic porphyrias. They also report pharmaceutical consulting work. Please see the study for full details."

            "article_content": "Today, the push for efficiency is more than just a goal- it's a necessity. Organizations are accelerating efforts to streamline processes, empower teams, and boost productivity to stay ahead of the curve. When workflows are streamlined, productivity increases, enabling organizations to scale effectively and adapt to the demands of an evolving market. AI is fundamentally centered on data\u2014training on the right data, ensuring secure access, and continuously refining this data is critical to meaningful AI-driven insights and automation success. Gartner predicts that by 2026, 30% of enterprises will automate over half of their network activities, reflecting a shift toward automation-driven efficiency. This trend not only enhances daily operations but also fosters a culture of growth and innovation, essential for staying competitive in a data-centric landscape.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nData services are an essential part of this transformation. They are persistent data storage services that bring powerful no-code data modeling and storage capabilities to your Robotic Process Automation (RPA) projects. Whether it\u2019s managing large data sets, automating data analysis, or simplifying access across departments, data services streamline the flow of information throughout an organization. They fit seamlessly into automation strategies, helping to reduce the manual effort needed for data handling and providing a foundation for predictive analytics, personalized customer experiences, and process improvements.\n\nThe Role of No-Code Data Services in Modern Automation\n\nTraditionally, handling data required technical expertise and complex configurations, which became even more challenging amid a talent shortage in automation-ready skills. No-code data services address this gap by offering a user-friendly approach that empowers business users, or citizen developers, to drive automation projects independently. Through simple, drag-and-drop functionality, data sets, files, and resources can be seamlessly incorporated into workflows without coding, while security and data consistency are maintained automatically.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAs organizations increasingly adopt automation, a no-code approach in data services becomes pivotal. It enables seamless integration with existing automation tools, allowing teams to manage, analyze, and access data across departments without relying heavily on IT support. By simplifying data handling, no-code data services make information more accessible and actionable, equipping organizations to provide real-time insights and solutions.\n\nA Practical Example: Monthly Financial Reporting\n\nIn monthly financial reporting, data from multiple systems, including bookings, invoices, billings, and payments, must be gathered. Without a centralized solution, both attended and unattended workflows retrieve data individually, requiring users to access all backend systems, leading to delays and potential inconsistencies. By setting up an unattended workflow to gather data in Data Service, other workflows can access this information consistently and efficiently. This eliminates the need for multiple data pulls, streamlines the reporting process, and mitigates issues related to data changes during the reporting cycle. Moreover, it removes the need to store aggregated data locally, enhancing data security and consistency across systems.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHow Enterprises Benefit from No-Code Data Services\n\nUnified Data Integration for Seamless Access: These services simplify the process of integrating data from disparate sources. By consolidating data from legacy platforms, enterprise systems, and custom applications into a single, secure repository, businesses can maintain data consistency and reliability across automations.\n\nStreamlined Data Reusability Across Automations: No-code data services offer a centralized data hub that makes information accessible and reusable across multiple automation projects. This eliminates the need for building separate connections for each workflow, enabling consistent data schemas and shareable variables through intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.\n\nScaling with Growth: As automation initiatives expand, the demand for scalable data solutions grows. No-code data services provide limitless capacity through secure platforms like Automation Cloud, allowing businesses to confidently scale their automation projects without sacrificing performance or security.\n\nEnhanced Security and Governance: Security remains a priority in a data-driven world. No-code data services help mitigate risks by transitioning sensitive information from local systems to a secure, centralized platform. With role-based access controls, organizations can manage data access and usage, ensuring that data governance remains intact.\n\nNo-Code as a Launchpad for Citizen Developers\n\nAdvertisment\n\nCitizen developers are crucial players in the digital transformation journey. Through no-code data services, employees in finance, marketing, HR, and customer service can independently create automated solutions, significantly enhancing productivity for themselves and their teams. With their deep understanding of daily operations and the potential impact of automation, they drive efficiency from the ground up, fostering continuous innovation and improvement.\n\nBy 2025, Gartner anticipates that 70% of new enterprise applications will harness low-code or no-code technologies\u2014a significant move reshaping the future of software development. This shift isn\u2019t just about innovation; it's a game-changer, empowering teams to drive transformation at pace, with greater flexibility and responsiveness. As organizations embrace these dynamic solutions, they\u2019re not only streamlining operations but also paving the way for transformative breakthroughs that redefine their impact.\n\nAttributed to Prashant Momaya, Senior Director of Sales Engineering, UiPath India"

According to data from Venture Intelligence, Indian AI startups raised $747 million in 2024, down 26% from last year but the number of deals in the space increased to 121 from 78 in 2023.\u201cThis year, we saw many companies building vertical AI applications by leveraging more mature platforms to build on top of that,\u201d said Ravi Srivastava, partner at early-stage investment firm Leo Capital.There are broadly three layers in the AI stack\u2014the foundational models, horizontal layers called enablers, and vertical AI applications. Leo Capital closed multiple deals in the AI and enterprise space this year, including Zeplyn, an AI copilot platform for financial advisors, Arch0, a cloud infrastructure security startup, and DecoverAI--a platform built for the legal community.Notably, several AI startups being backed by investors in India are building in the US. Peak XV Partners managing director Harshjit Sethi, who focuses on AI investments for the VC firm, said that AI startups are expected to follow the trend set by enterprise software companies, which mostly build for US customers.\u201cWhat we should expect to see, and my hope for next year, is that there will be many more interesting application layer opportunities,\u201d said Sethi. \u201cTaking the capabilities of AI and translating them into what it means for each of our roles, I think that gap will be something companies will look to address, particularly those in India.\u201dAccording to Tracxn, Peak XV Partners, through its various programmes and the main fund, backed 13 startups building in AI space this year, including Enterpret, RapidCanvas, OrbitShift and Brainfish. Peak XV also participated in the $105 million round for SaaS startup Atlan, which is aiming to capitalise on the opportunity from large corporations looking to make their databases suitable for artificial intelligence.In addition to a series of small-cheque deals in the AI space this year, some of the larger deals included Mukesh Bansal-founded enterprise AI assistant platform Nurix AI, AI cloud and platform-as-a-service startup Neysa, and Bhavish Aggarwal-led Krutrim AI, which became a unicorn, a privately-held company valued at $1 billion or more.Industry executives said in addition to the application layer, the opportunity for India is in the infrastructure layer, having missed the chance to compete on foundational models that are largely being developed in the US by large companies such as OpenAI, Meta, Google and Anthropic, which have raised billions of dollars in funding.Neysa, which operates in the infrastructure layer, offers generative AI platforms and services to assist clients in managing AI projects. It raised $50 million this year across two rounds . Founder Sharad Sanghi pointed out that while the process was easier for them due to his experience with data centre services provider Netmagic, building the infrastructure layer is challenging for new startups. As a result, most new AI startups are focusing on consumer and enterprise applications.\u201cBecause of our relationship with NTT and my experience founding Netmagic, I had access to data center space and power, which not everyone has. Access to capital is also crucial, as well as access to the right talent. You need highly skilled engineers on both the infrastructure and platform side. This talent is available, but it's expensive and hard to attract,\u201d he told ET.The Indian government took a major step by approving a Rs 10,372-crore allocation for the India AI Mission for the next five years, focusing on building computing infrastructure through public-private partnerships.However, VCs are of the view that the hype over AI has created a glut at the inception stage with regard to the applications layer.\u201cTechnology is changing so rapidly that the notion of \u2018problem\u2019 and \u2018value\u2019 is getting redefined every quarter,\u201d said Alok Goyal, partner, Stellaris Venture Partners. \u201cIt is not clear if what is differentiated today will remain so in just a few months. Secondly, entry barriers have become much lower, and hence in every space, there is a clutter at the inception stage of the category itself. This is particularly so for AI applications.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The latest AI model from OpenAI achieved an \u201cimpressive leap in performance\u201d but it still hasn\u2019t demonstrated what experts classify as human-level intelligence\n\nOpenAI announced a breakthrough achievement for its new o3 AI model Rokas Tenys / Alamy\n\nOpenAI\u2019s new o3 artificial intelligence model has achieved a breakthrough high score on a prestigious AI reasoning test called the ARC Challenge, inspiring some AI fans to speculate that o3 has achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI). But even as ARC Challenge organisers described o3\u2019s achievement as a major milestone, they also cautioned that it has not won the competition\u2019s grand prize \u2013 and it is only one step on the path towards AGI, a term for hypothetical future AI with human-like intelligence.\n\nThe o3 model is the latest in a line of AI releases that follow on from the large language models powering ChatGPT. \u201cThis is a surprising and important step-function increase in AI capabilities, showing novel task adaptation ability never seen before in the GPT-family models,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, an engineer at Google and the main creator of the ARC Challenge, in a blog post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat did OpenAI\u2019s o3 model actually do?\n\nChollet designed the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) Challenge in 2019 to test how well AIs can find correct patterns linking pairs of coloured grids. Such visual puzzles are intended to make AIs demonstrate a form of general intelligence with basic reasoning capabilities. But throwing enough computing power at the puzzles could let even a non-reasoning program simply solve them through brute force. To prevent this, the competition also requires official score submissions to meet certain limits on computing power.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s newly announced o3 model \u2013 which is scheduled for release in early 2025 \u2013 achieved its official breakthrough score of 75.7 per cent on the ARC Challenge\u2019s \u201csemi-private\u201d test, which is used for ranking competitors on a public leaderboard. The computing cost of its achievement was approximately $20 for each visual puzzle task, meeting the competition\u2019s limit of less than $10,000 total. However, the harder \u201cprivate\u201d test that is used to determine grand prize winners has an even more stringent computing power limit, equivalent to spending just 10 cents on each task, which OpenAI did not meet.\n\nThe o3 model also achieved an unofficial score of 87.5 per cent by applying approximately 172 times more computing power than it did on the official score. For comparison, the typical human score is 84 per cent, and an 85 per cent score is enough to win the ARC Challenge\u2019s $600,000 grand prize \u2013 if the model can also keep its computing costs within the required limits.\n\nSign up to our The Daily newsletter The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. Sign up to newsletter\n\nBut to reach its unofficial score, o3\u2019s cost soared to thousands of dollars spent solving each task. OpenAI requested that the challenge organisers not publish the exact computing costs.\n\nDoes this o3 achievement show that AGI has been reached?\n\nNo, the ARC challenge organisers have specifically said they do not consider beating this competition benchmark to be an indicator of having achieved AGI.\n\nThe o3 model also failed to solve more than 100 visual puzzle tasks, even when OpenAI applied a very large amount of computing power toward the unofficial score, said Mike Knoop, an ARC Challenge organiser at software company Zapier, in a social media post on X.\n\nIn a social media post on Bluesky, Melanie Mitchell at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico said the following about o3\u2019s progress on the ARC benchmark: \u201cI think solving these tasks by brute-force compute defeats the original purpose\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile the new model is very impressive and represents a big milestone on the way towards AGI, I don\u2019t believe this is AGI \u2013 there\u2019s still a fair number of very easy [ARC Challenge] tasks that o3 can\u2019t solve,\u201d said Chollet in another X post.\n\nHowever, Chollet described how we might know when human-level intelligence has been demonstrated by some form of AGI. \u201cYou\u2019ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible,\u201d he said in the blog post.\n\nThomas Dietterich at Oregon State University suggests another way to recognise AGI. \u201cThose architectures claim to include all of the functional components required for human cognition,\u201d he says. \u201cBy this measure, the commercial AI systems are missing episodic memory, planning, logical reasoning and, most importantly, meta-cognition.\u201d\n\nSo what does o3\u2019s high score really mean?\n\nThe o3 model\u2019s high score comes as the tech industry and AI researchers have been reckoning with a slower pace of progress in the latest AI models for 2024, compared with the initial explosive developments of 2023.\n\nAlthough it did not win the ARC Challenge, o3\u2019s high score indicates that AI models could beat the competition benchmark in the near future. Beyond its unofficial high score, Chollet says many official low-compute submissions have already scored above 81 per cent on the private evaluation test set.\n\nDietterich also thinks that \u201cthis is a very impressive leap in performance\u201d. However, he cautions that, without knowing more about how OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3 models work, it is impossible to evaluate just how impressive the high score is. For instance, if o3 was able to practise the ARC problems in advance, then that would make its achievement easier. \u201cWe will need to await an open-source replication to understand the full significance of this,\u201d says Dietterich.\n\nThe ARC Challenge organisers are already looking to launch a second and more difficult set of benchmark tests sometime in 2025. They will also keep the ARC Prize 2025 challenge running until someone achieves the grand prize and open-sources their solution."

            "article_content": "LONDON: A US$93bil plunge in Novo Nordisk A/S shares has provided the latest blow to Europe\u2019s largest listed companies, which have spent another year struggling in vain to match the returns of Wall Street\u2019s biggest stocks.\n\nWhile the top 10 US stocks have notched double-digit returns in 2024, powered by the so-called Magnificent Seven, six of Europe\u2019s biggest names are in the red.\n\nThey include Ozempic maker Novo, whose gains for the year were fully erased in last Friday\u2019s selloff, as well as Nestle SA and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA.\n\nAll that has put the Stoxx Europe 600 index on course for its worst performance relative to the S&P 500 in almost a quarter century.\n\nAnd a basket of sector-dominant European stocks compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc has fared even worse, lagging the Stoxx for the first time since 2017.\n\n\u201cTo a large degree, the Magnificent Seven carried the S&P 500,\u201d Morningstar strategist Michael Field said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t have big companies in Europe, but the scale difference is so huge.\u201d\n\nEuropean heavyweights suffer two disadvantages.\n\nOne, as Field points out, is size.\n\nGoldman\u2019s large-cap basket \u2013 dubbed the Granolas \u2013 is cumulatively worth some US$2.5 trillion, while the Magnificent Seven have added about US$5 trillion this year alone, taking their combined value past US$16 trillion.\n\nSecond, so-called old economy stocks dominate European large-cap ranks.\n\nThe 11-member Granolas basket contains only two tech-related names, SAP SE and ASML Holding NV.\n\nSectors such as autos, industrials and miners are usually heavily exposed to the ebb and flow of economic cycles.\n\nLuxury stocks, for instance, have been hit hard by China\u2019s consumer slowdown, while at Nestle, faltering sales growth has put shares on track for their worst year on record.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental structural issue in Europe in that it doesn\u2019t have global champions really, and it certainly doesn\u2019t have global champions in the hottest part of the market \u2013 technology and artificial intelligence,\u201d said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Co.\n\nThere are some signs of unease over the Magnificent Seven\u2019s blistering rally \u2013 and their dominance of benchmarks.\n\nFor instance, Matthew Cioppa, portfolio manager of the Franklin Technology Fund, said he is happy to own some Magnificent Seven stocks, but also has significant exposure to smaller, software names.\n\nMany also expect green shoots in Europe, citing cheap valuations, the likelihood of a Chinese stimulus bazooka and a possible spending pick-up in Germany.\n\nSo could things change next year? Strategists polled by Bloomberg reckon not, forecasting Wall Street to triumph again in 2025.\n\nWhile some see President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policies as a plus for the Magnificent Seven, their consistent profit growth is likely a bigger draw.\n\nEarnings are forecast to rise about 15.7% next year, versus the 9.9% expected for the Granalos, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIn a period of time when macroeconomic growth has been pretty unexciting and other sectors have had their challenges, that reliability of earnings delivery has given the market confidence in US tech,\u201d said Iain Barnes, chief investment officer at Netwealth Investments Ltd.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t see that from other markets,\u201d he added. \u2014 Bloomberg"

Their substantial weight in the indices often lifts other major stocks, but the real challenge lies in sustaining these gains.\"\n\nAmong sectoral indices, Nifty Auto buckled under selling pressure, becoming the only sector to trade in the red. Nifty IT, which had gained 1 percent in the morning, pared its gains to end at the flatline. Nifty Bank, Metal, and Realty also trimmed their advances, trading up in the range 0.8-1.5 percent. Banking giants HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, and Axis Bank supported the sector, while the metal pack saw gains of 1-2 percent in stocks like JSW Steel, Tata Steel, Coal India, and Vedanta. The FMCG index, which has fallen 16 percent in the past three months, gained momentum to end 1 percent higher.\n\nAlso read: Bullish market sentiment powers record PE/VC firms and promoter exits in 2024\n\nThe mid and small-cap indices showcased a mixed trend. While mid-cap was up just 0.33 percent, smallcap index fell 0.2 percent. Over the past three months, both indices have shown resilience, slipping just 5 percent each, compared to the Nifty's sharper 9 percent decline during the same period. \"Large caps offer valuation comfort, with around 28 out of 50 Nifty stocks still trading below their long-term averages. This suggests limited downside potential, supported by favourable technical indicators,\" Mishra said. \"While small and mid-caps have performed exceptionally well and may continue to outperform selectively, sustaining this trend will largely depend on earnings support,\" he added.\n\nInternational Gemological Institute shares closed 2 percent higher from a day's high of 9 percent. This comes after listing at a 22 percent premium in the previous trading session on December 20. The company's market valuation stood at Rs 21,229.85 crore on the BSE.

            "article_content": "(MENAFN- GlobeNewsWire - Nasdaq) As the meniscus matures, it encounters shifting patient demographics and technological advancements, requiring healthcare providers to navigate new challenges while striving to meet the increasing demand for effective knee injury treatments. New Delhi, Dec. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The US meniscus treatment market is projected to hit the market valuation of US$ 479.38 million by 2033 from US$ 237.87 million in 2024 at a CAGR of 8.24% during the forecast period 2025\u20132033. The future of the meniscus treatment market in the United States is poised for significant growth, driven by advancements in medical technology, increasing awareness of joint health, and a growing patient base. As of 2023, over 1 million meniscus injuries are diagnosed annually, with a substantial portion requiring medical intervention. The market is expected to benefit from the rising adoption of minimally invasive procedures, such as arthroscopic meniscus repair, which accounted for 500,000 surgeries in 2023. These procedures are becoming the gold standard due to their ability to preserve knee function and reduce recovery times. Additionally, the development of biologic treatments, such as meniscal scaffolds and tissue-engineered implants, is expected to revolutionize the market by offering regenerative solutions for damaged cartilage. Request Sample Copy @ The aging population is a key driver of meniscus treatment market growth, with over 54 million adults aged 65 and older in the US as of 2023. This demographic is particularly susceptible to degenerative meniscus tears, which are expected to increase in prevalence. Simultaneously, the rise in sports participation among younger individuals is contributing to a higher incidence of acute meniscus injuries. For example, 30 million children and adolescents participate in organized sports annually, many of which involve high-impact activities that strain the knee joint. The growing emphasis on maintaining an active lifestyle across all age groups is further fueling demand for effective meniscus treatments. Technological advancements and improved healthcare infrastructure are also shaping the future of the US meniscus treatment market. In 2023, the US healthcare system saw over 70 million health club memberships, reflecting a societal focus on fitness and wellness. This trend has led to an increase in sports-related injuries, with 2 million sports injuries reported annually. Additionally, the rising adoption of outpatient surgical centers, which performed 60% of meniscus surgeries in 2023, is making treatments more accessible and cost-effective. As insurance coverage expands and innovative products like Smith & Nephew's Fast-Fix 360 and Arthrex's Meniscal Cinch II gain traction, the meniscus treatment market is set to experience robust growth, addressing the needs of an increasingly active and aging population. Key Findings in US Meniscus Treatment Market\n\nMarket Forecast (2033) US$ 479.38 million CAGR 8.24% By Product Type All-inside Meniscal Repair System (47.26%) By Application Radial Tear (27.61%) By Patient Demographics Elderly Population (47.79%) By End Users Hospitals (58.13%) By Payers Private Insurance (62.86%) Top Drivers\n\nIncreasing sports injuries due to active lifestyles and youth athletic participation growth.\n\nAging population leading to higher incidence of degenerative meniscal tears requiring treatment. Technological advancements making meniscus surgeries more effective and minimally invasive. Top Trends\n\nRising adoption of arthroscopic meniscus repair over meniscectomy to preserve knee function.\n\nDevelopment of biologic treatments like meniscal scaffolds and allograft transplantation. Growth in outpatient surgical centers for cost-effective meniscus procedures. Top Challenges\n\nHigh costs of advanced meniscus treatments limiting accessibility for some patients.\n\nLimited regenerative capacity of meniscal tissue hindering complete recovery. Risk of postoperative complications leading to patient reluctance for surgical options.\n\nAll-Inside Meniscal Repair Systems is Revolutionizing Meniscus Treatment Market with Precision and Efficiency, Set to Control Over 47% Market Share\n\nThe all-inside meniscal repair system has gained significant traction in the U.S. market due to its ability to address a wide range of meniscal injuries with remarkable precision and efficiency. With over 800,000 arthroscopic knee surgeries performed annually in the U.S., a majority now incorporate the all-inside technique for meniscal repairs. This system eliminates the need for open incisions, instead enabling repair through small portals, which reduces recovery time and improves surgical outcomes. Cutting-edge devices like the Arthrex FiberStitch and DePuy Synthes TRUESPAN feature pre-loaded implants and advanced suture delivery systems, allowing surgeons to perform repairs on complex tears with enhanced ease and accuracy. Such innovations have contributed to the growing adoption of this technique across surgical centers nationwide.\n\nThe demand for all-inside meniscal repair systems in the meniscus treatment market is also driven by the increasing focus on joint preservation, especially among patients under 50 years old, who account for nearly 60% of meniscus surgeries annually. The technique has proven effective in preserving long-term knee functionality, significantly reducing the risk of osteoarthritis development compared to partial meniscectomy procedures. Furthermore, healthcare facilities are adopting these systems due to their cost efficiency, with reduced hospital stays saving up to $1,500 per patient. The minimally invasive nature of the procedure also aligns with the preferences of athletes and physically active individuals, who represent nearly 30% of meniscal tear cases annually in the U.S., as it allows for a quicker return to sports and daily activities.\n\nRadial Tears is A Complex Challenge Driving Innovations in U.S. Meniscus Treatment, to Hold over 27% Market Share\n\nRadial tears dominate the U.S. meniscus treatment market due to their structural complexity and the severe functional impairment they cause. These tears disrupt the circumferential fibers responsible for distributing loads across the knee joint, leading to instability and pain. Recent studies estimate that radial tears are detected in over 1.8 million patients annually in the U.S., with this number rising due to improved diagnostic capabilities. MRI advancements have enabled earlier and more accurate identification of these injuries, with over 40 million MRIs performed each year, a significant portion focusing on knee-related conditions. This has heightened awareness among patients and physicians about the importance of timely intervention to prevent long-term complications, such as osteoarthritis.\n\nThe prevalence of radial tears is further driven by lifestyle factors and demographic shifts. High-impact sports like basketball, football, and soccer contribute to nearly 600,000 sports-related meniscal injuries annually, a significant portion of which are radial tears. Additionally, the aging population, which now includes over 56 million individuals aged 65 and above, is more susceptible to degenerative radial tears in the US meniscus treatment market due to the natural weakening of meniscal fibers over time. Obesity-the leading risk factor for knee injuries-affects more than 40 million obese adults in the U.S., further increasing the burden of radial tears. These factors have made radial tear treatment a priority in meniscus repair, with healthcare providers adopting innovative surgical techniques to address their complexity and restore knee function effectively.\n\nInquire more about this report before purchase:\n\nElderly Adults and Meniscus Injuries is the Growing Burden of Degeneration and Aging Joints\n\nElderly individuals represent the largest demographic requiring meniscus treatment in the U.S., driven by age-related degeneration and cumulative wear on the knee joint. Meniscal tears are diagnosed in over 2 million elderly patients annually, with this group accounting for the majority of degenerative tears seen in clinical settings. As the meniscus loses elasticity and hydration with age, even low-impact activities like walking or bending can cause significant injuries. Coupled with the increasing prevalence of comorbidities such as osteoarthritis, which affects more than 30 million Americans, the elderly population faces a heightened risk of knee pain and reduced mobility.\n\nThe dominance of meniscal injuries among seniors is also linked to demographic trends, as the U.S. population aged 65 and older has grown to nearly 60 million in 2023, with many striving to maintain active lifestyles. Among this group, regular physical activity participation has risen, with over 18 million seniors engaging in exercise routines, inadvertently increasing the risk of knee injuries. Furthermore, obesity-a condition that accelerates joint degeneration-affects nearly 15 million elderly Americans, adding to the strain on knee cartilage. With the elderly demographic accounting for over 65% of meniscus repair surgeries annually, healthcare providers are under increasing pressure to offer advanced surgical solutions tailored to this vulnerable population's specific needs.\n\nTop 6 Players Control Nearly 60% Market Share of the US Meniscus Treatment Market\n\nSmith & Nephew, Stryker, DePuy Synthes (Johnson & Johnson), Zimmer Biomet, CONMED Corporation, and Double Medical Technology Inc. are top 6 players in the US market. Wherein, Smith & Nephew held over 18.12% market share. Smith & Nephew has established a dominant position in the meniscus treatment market in the United States, driven by a combination of innovative product offerings, strategic acquisitions, and a commitment to advancing surgical techniques. The company's leadership is particularly evident in its development of the NOVOSTITCHTM Meniscal Repair System, which has demonstrated exceptional clinical outcomes for complex meniscal tear patterns. This system has shown a remarkable 91.7% success rate at one-year follow-up and a 0% re-operation rate with 100% meniscal healing at six months in earlier trials. Smith & Nephew's strategic focus on shifting the surgical paradigm from meniscectomy to meniscal repair has been a key factor in its market dominance. By offering advanced repair systems like the NOVOSTITCH PRO and FAST-FIX 360, the company aims to increase the proportion of meniscal tears treated with repair rather than removal, addressing a significant unmet need in the market.\n\nThe company's product portfolio in the meniscus treatment market is comprehensive and includes several key offerings that have contributed to its market leadership. The FAST-FIX 360 Meniscal Repair System, with its 20-year history of successful meniscal tear repairs, features a 360\u00b0 actuation design for precise control and deployment of implants. Building on this success, the FAST-FIX FLEX Meniscal Repair System introduces a surgeon-guided, bendable needle and shaft, enhancing access to all zones of the meniscus and improving procedural efficiency. The acquisition of Ceterix Orthopaedics and its NovoStitch Pro Meniscal Repair System has further expanded Smith & Nephew's capabilities, enabling the repair of complex meniscal tears such as horizontal, radial, and root tears. This comprehensive product line, coupled with the company's commitment to research and development, has solidified Smith & Nephew's position as a market leader, with the company holding over a third of the total global meniscal repair market share in 2022.\n\nU.S. Meniscus Treatment Market Key Players:\n\n\n\nSmith & Nephew\n\nDePuy Synthes (Johnson & Johnson)\n\nStryker\n\nZimmer Biomet\n\nARCURO MEDICAL\n\nInnomed Inc\n\nCONMED Corporation\n\nArthrex, Inc.\n\nBIOTEK\n\nDouble Medical Technology Inc.

            "article_content": "The skies above New Jersey are teeming with mysteries. Strange lights. Flying objects. Thousands of eyewitnesses. They want to believe\u2026 but the truth? The truth is boring.\n\nPlanes, Planes Everywhere\n\n\n\nThe Lights That Deceived Us All\n\n\n\nBut My Flight App Said It Wasn\u2019t a Plane!\n\n\n\nStill, Some Mysteries Remain\u2026\n\n\n\nThe Truth Is Boring\n\n\n\nWelcome to the great New Jersey drone panic of 2024.It all started innocently enough in November, when Morris County residents began spotting strange, brightly lit objects zipping through the night sky. Videos flooded social media. Theories spread faster than free pizza in an office break room. Were they drones? Secret government tech? Aliens? By December, sightings were popping up across several states, and people were convinced that something big was happening.Spoiler alert: it wasn\u2019t.Turns out, all that mystery boiled down to one simple explanation \u2013 planes.Northern New Jersey doesn\u2019t just have busy roads; it\u2019s got airways that are practically bumper-to-bumper. Between major hubs like Newark Liberty and smaller airstrips, this patch of sky sees over 2,500 flights on a regular basis. That\u2019s everything from jumbo jets to tiny helicopters, all lit up like Christmas trees.But to the human eye, especially at night, those lights can do a number on your perception. What looks like a drone buzzing low to the ground might actually be a commercial flight cruising at 5,000 feet. In one viral video, an object people swore was a drone turned out to be a United Airlines flight miles above. Another \u201chovering UFO\u201d over Morris County? Just a regular passenger jet doing its thing.Here\u2019s the thing about aircraft: they have rules about lights. The FAA says planes need red and green navigation lights, white strobes, and landing lights. Drones? They only need one light visible from three miles away.Most of the sightings in New Jersey didn\u2019t even match drone lighting patterns. Instead, they looked suspiciously like the FAA-required setup for planes and helicopters. Yet somehow, people were seeing extraterrestrial invaders instead of your garden-variety airliner.Ah, yes, the trusty flight-tracking apps. Many amateur sleuths whipped these out, scanning the skies and declaring anything not on their screens as \u201cdefinitely a drone.\u201d Here\u2019s the problem: flight apps don\u2019t track everything. Smaller planes, older aircraft, and certain government missions can slip through the cracks. So just because it\u2019s not on your app doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not up there.Even New Jersey Senator Andy Kim fell for it. After a night chasing lights with local police, he tweeted concerns about America\u2019s drone detection capabilities . The next day? He backtracked, admitting most of what he saw were likely planes.For the die-hard conspiracy theorists, don\u2019t worry \u2013 not everything\u2019s been explained. The FBI has received over 5,000 drone-related tips nationwide, though most turned out to be planes or legal drones. Only about 100 sightings still have investigators scratching their heads.But here\u2019s the kicker: the FBI and FAA insist there\u2019s no threat to public safety. Still, the FAA slapped a temporary ban on drones flying over parts of New Jersey, probably to give everyone a breather from the hysteria.At the end of the day, what we\u2019re left with isn\u2019t a sci-fi saga or a covert government operation. It\u2019s just New Jersey\u2019s impossibly busy airspace doing what it does best: confusing the hell out of everyone.So next time you see strange lights overhead, remember: the skies aren\u2019t full of secrets. They\u2019re full of planes."

The rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa\n\nHe has been dedicated to UFO research for decades.\n\nThe first thing Hansj\u00fcrgen K\u00f6hler insists on clarifying as we begin our conversation is that at his place of work, the Central Research Network for Extraordinary Celestial Phenomena (CENAP), they don't believe aliens are lurking somewhere on Earth.\n\n\"We differ from the ufologists, who claim that there is an extraterrestrial presence on Earth,\" says K\u00f6hler, the founder and director of Germany's UFO registration office CENAP.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome ufologists, he explains, claim that some 113 dead and living aliens remain hidden in the US after 30 flying saucers crashed there.\n\n\"This is completely unfounded and also goes against our experience in over 50 years of active case investigations,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nAccording to its director, CENAP has processed more than 11,000 reports of unusual celestial sightings to date, analysing hundreds of photos and videos that could be attributed to natural and earthly causes.\n\nWhile there are currently 119 unsolved cases, there's no reason to engage in speculation, K\u00f6hler says. The problem with those cases is that they miss key data like the date, time or location of the sighting.\n\nPoint of contact for observers of the inexplicable\n\nFor all those immediately thinking of aliens, K\u00f6hler reminds us of the meaning of the acronym UFO: unidentified flying object.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe founded CENAP as a \"point of contact for all those who want an explanation for a phenomenon they observed and didn't understand.\"\n\nThe organization, founded in 1976, is supported by the European Space Agency (ESA) and Germany's air traffic control company DFS.\n\nThe type of cases reported to CENAP has changed dramatically over the decades, K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn the 80s, mini hot-air balloons caused a stir, followed by sky tracker beams and disco lights in the 90s.\n\nAt the turn of the millennium the centre saw a spike in reports due to Chinese Lanterns and in the 2010s, private and industrial drones entered the mix.\n\nNumber of reports spike thanks to Musk\n\nFor about five years now, the rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, with its Starlink satellites driving up the number of UFO sightings.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"In normal years, we usually had 300 to 400 cases, but now, for the past five years, that has gone up to 700 to 900,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nIn 2024, the organization recorded over 850 cases by October 20, with the figure expected to surpass 1,000 by the end of the year.\n\nBut not all cases can be attributed to Musk's satellite network, which aims to provide global internet coverage.\n\nSo-called burnups - rocket ignitions - in orbit sometimes also prompt people to make a report \"because they cause fantastic formations at the zenith of the night sky when illuminated by the sun,\" K\u00f6hler explains.\n\nVerifying a UFO sighting\n\nBut what exactly happens after a UFO sighting is reported?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst of all, CENAP records the basic info: date, time and location of the sighting.\n\nThey then create a map of the location and enter the witness's description and any attached photos or videos into a case file.\n\nOnly then does the real work begin: \"The next step is to check for the usual suspects. In the case of night sightings, we check astronomical data for the location of the sighting (planets, star charts), as well as satellite, ISS and bright rocket parts overflight data if necessary,\" K\u00f6hler says.\n\nThe organization also checks air traffic data to make sure the sighting wasn't an aircraft or a helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThey compare the photos and videos of the report with their extensive archive dating back to 1973. \"This usually leads to the identification of the respective observation,\" says the CENAP director.\n\nDo only conspiracy theorists report UFO sightings?\n\nWhile you might think that it's only people who believe in aliens who report UFO sightings, \"we have people from all age groups and professions\" who file reports, K\u00f6hler says.\n\n\"99% of them want us to explain what they have seen, and they are not coming to us expecting to have spotted an alien spaceship.\"\n\n\"Of course there is that 1% who are convinced that they have seen an alien spaceship ... who are disappointed when we identify an earthly cause,\" he adds.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUFO sightings are not only reported all over Germany, it's a thing elsewhere too.\n\nIn the US, the National UFO Reporting Centre, founded in 1974 by UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble, has processed more than 180,000 reports since its beginnings.\n\nWhat drives a UFO researcher\n\nK\u00f6hler says he is keen to explain these sightings for several reasons.\n\nFor one thing, he is always curious when new things appear in the sky, especially amid the recent technological developments including new devices used for event lighting as well as drones, which are increasingly visible.\n\nIn addition, his organization is the only reasonable point of contact for citizens looking for a scientific explanation for their observations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nK\u00f6hler's fascination with space stems from when he was 11, watching the moon landing on TV in black-and-white, he says.\n\nAt that time, he did not rule out the idea of extraterrestial life - or even the possibility that aliens could land on Earth.\n\n\"Because if we humans had the opportunity to go to the moon, why shouldn't aliens be able to?\"\n\nToday, he separates his UFO research from extraterrestrial life, since he \"has so far been unable to find any evidence of extraterrestrial visits to Earth.\"\n\n\"From my astronomical knowledge, however, I am convinced that extraterrestrial life exists and that we will find evidence in the future with our probes and better telescopes.\"\n\nThe rise of SpaceX, the space company owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, has also been reflected in reports made to CENAP, Germany's UFO registration office. The deployment of SpaceX's Starlink satellites has been linked to the increase in UFO sightings. Gene Blevins/ZUMA Press Wire/dpa"

            "article_content": "It may be an overused statistic, but it\u2019s true: We know less about what lives and lurks in our oceans than we do about outer space. This year proved no exception to the rule, either. In the last year, researchers discovered long-lost shipwrecks, odd animals, and even a phenomenon known as \u201cdark oxygen,\u201d among many other finds.\n\n\u2018Ghost Ship of the Pacific\u2019 found using underwater drones\n\nThe USS Stewart rests about 3,500 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Ocean Infinity\n\nIt only took a few hours for a team of 20-foot-long autonomous submersible drones to relocate the USS Stewart after 78 years spent at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The \u201cfour-piper\u201d destroyer ship was the only vessel captured by Japanese forces during World War II, and earned its \u201cGhost Ship\u201d moniker after numerous Allied troops sighted it deep behind enemy lines. Although eventually returned to the US Navy and scuttled, its exact location remained a mystery for years. Now, however, we know the extremely well-preserved remains lay off the California coast in the Cordell Bank national marine sanctuary.\n\nShipwreck hunters find WWII-era merchant ship that sunk in Lake Superior\n\nThe wheel of the Arlington, about 600 feet underwater. Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society\n\nAlthough also dating back to the WWII era, the Arlington wasn\u2019t involved in combat when it sank. The 244-foot bulk carrier was instead a merchant vessel sailing Lake Superior en route to Owen Sound, Ontario. Inclement weather, however, caused the ship to take on water in the early hours of May 1. While Captain Frederick \u201cTatey Bug\u201d Burke insisted his crew stay the course, the sailors had other plans, and soon abandoned Burke to his\u2014and his ship\u2019s\u2014ultimate fate. Like the USS Stewart, the Arlington was located using remote operating submersibles and sonar scans.\n\nNew, colorful starfish species found off the coast of Japan\n\nThe newly discovered Paragonaster hoeimaruae. There are many types of starfish and this one is particularly adapted to living in sandy, muddy waters, a feature the researchers want to learn more about. Credit: \u00a9 I. Kobayashi\n\nThere are around 2,000 cataloged starfish species in the world, but that list grew by at least one new variety in 2024. Discovered by researchers off the coast of Japan\u2019s Izu Peninsula, Paragonaster hoeimaruae, is only the second starfish known to belong to the Pseudarchasteridae family. The strikingly orange sea creatures are especially adapted to live in muddy, sandy waters\u2014an evolutionary trait researchers hope to learn more about in the coming years.\n\nGrumpy-faced fish species found in Red Sea\n\nThe grumpy dwarfgoby is endemic to the Red Sea and lives in small holes and crevices in coral reefs. Viktor Nunes Peinemann\n\nWhile similarly as orange as Paragonaster hoeimaruae, Sueviota aethon arguably features a much more noticeable physical trait: the diminutive fish possesses a downturned mouth that makes it look permanently displeased. Its face seems so irritated that it even earned it the common name of the grumpy dwarfgoby. The roughly one inch long fish live among the coral reefs of the Red Sea\u2019s Farasan Banks near Saudi Arabia. Even at that size, however, discoverers describe the grumpy dwarfgoby as a \u201cfearsome predator\u201d given its comparatively large canines used to capture and devour small invertebrates.\n\nWWII submarine discovered 81 years after disappearing during secret mission\n\nThe HMS Trooper disappeared in 1943 with all 64 of its crew. Credit: YouTube / Planet Blue\n\nIt took at least as many as 14 attempts over nearly 25 years, but researchers finally located the wreckage of the HMS Trooper in 2024. The WWII Allied submarine and its 64 crew members deployed on a secret mission near Greece in early October 1943, but never arrived in Beirut as originally scheduled. Researchers used both sonar and an ROV called \u201cSuper Achille\u201d to identify Trooper\u2019s whereabouts, as well as confirm its fatal run-in with a German mine. Trooper lays in three separate parts an estimated 830-feet-deep at the bottom of the Icarian Sea, near the Greek island of Donoussa.\n\nWorld\u2019s largest coral formation is longer than a blue whale\n\nA diver from National Geographic Pristine Seas measures the world\u2019s largest coral colony in the Solomon Islands. Photograph by Manu San F\u00e9lix, National Geographic Pristine Seas\n\nThe biggest animal in the world may be the blue whale, but researchers in 2024 determined that the biggest intertwined community of animals is undoubtedly the recently discovered Pavona clavus coral colony. Measuring in at 111 feet wide, 104 feet long, 18 feet high, and 600 feet around, the standalone coral system formed in the southwest Pacific Ocean over the last 300 years, and can even be seen from space.\n\nNew ghost shark species found in New Zealand\n\nThe newly described Australasian narrow-nosed spookfish, Harriotta avia. National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA)\n\nGhost sharks, also known as \u201cspookfish,\u201d technically aren\u2019t sharks, but instead are a group of fish that are closely related to the ocean predators. One of the newest additions to the family this year was Harriotta avia, described as having an \u201celongated, narrow and depressed snout; long, slender trunk; large eyes; and very long, broad pectoral fins\u201d as well as possessing \u201clovely chocolate brown color.\u201d But don\u2019t expect to encounter one in the open waters\u2014Harriotta avia lives near New Zealand at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, roughly 8,350 feet below surface waters.\n\n\u2018Dark oxygen\u2019 on ocean floor may rewrite the origins of life\n\nThe formations can be found as deep as 20,000 feet below the ocean\u2019s surface. Credit: Wikipedia Commons\n\nOne of the wildest underwater discoveries of 2024 wasn\u2019t a new species of life, but chemical processes that might rewrite our understanding of the origins of life itself. Earlier this year, researchers published findings related to polymetallic nodules\u2014natural mineral deposits located on the pitch-black ocean floor. Despite lacking sunlight, however, evidence suggests these formations appear to function as \u201cgeobatteries\u201d capable of generating trace amounts of oxygen that help sustain deep-sea life. If true, then the planet\u2019s very first living organisms may have gotten their start in a place no one once thought could support life at all.\n\nNew jellyfish discovered near Japan may contain multitudes of venom\n\nThe St. George\u2019s Cross medusa is about four inches wide, three inches long, and has about 240 tentacles. Dhugal John Lindsay/JAMSTEC\n\nLike many other similar species, the newly found St. George\u2019s cross medusa lives around 2,300 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean, and hunts bioluminescent prey with its many tentacles. Unlike its relatives, however, Santjordia pagesi packs an \u201carsenal of venoms\u201d that differs from other known jellyfish. Unfortunately, it might take a little while before researchers start gleaning more information on the creature\u2014it\u2019s difficult to gather more specimens given the jellyfish lives in a deep-sea volcanic caldera about 285 miles south of Tokyo.\n\nResearchers discover neurological mechanism controlling anglerfish lures\n\nFrogfish belong to the larger anglerfish family, and use their front fin as a lure. Credit: Deposit Photos\n\nAnglerfish aren\u2019t a new find for researchers, but biologists did confirm a surprising evolutionary feature in the odd-looking animals this year. Using tracer analysis, a team discovered the exact motor neurons that control one of the subspecies\u2019 front dorsal fin lure. It appears the location of these motoneurons shifted during their evolution compared to their relatives, pointing to evolutionary implications that reach all the way to landwalking vertebrates.\n\nOver 100 possible new ocean species found near Chile\n\nDuring an expedition off the coasts of Chile and Rapa Nui, scientists spotted a bony Chaunacops fish swimming in the waters of Chile\u2019s Nazca-Desventuradas Marine Park. Schmidt Ocean Institute\n\nThe 1,800-mile-long Salas y G\u00f3mez Ridge near Chile is home to some wild creatures that look like they just arrived from an alien planet. Earlier this year, researchers used a remote operated submersible to survey the region and documented over 100 candidates for never-before-seen species. These included crustaceans, mollusks, fish, and even marine mammals. Biologists also glimpsed extremely rare animals, such as the whiplash squid."

Advertisement\n\nCoincidentally, the ceremony coincided with the 61st anniversary celebrations of the Zanzibar Revolution of 1964.\n\nDr Mwinyi reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to recognising the vital role of higher learning institutions in driving development, particularly by producing skilled professionals across various sectors.\n\nThe President pointed out that KIST\u2019s achievements since its establishment in 1966 are a testament to the Zanzibar Revolution\u2019s vision of building an institution that has benefitted many Zanzibari youth.\n\n\u201cMany KIST alumni hold key leadership positions in the country, showcasing the transformative power of education,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Mwinyi noted that the founding of KIST was a direct reflection of the Afro-Shirazi Party\u2019s (ASP) manifesto, which prioritised vocational and technical education to equip students with self-reliance skills.\n\nHe said the goal aligns with the 2020-2025 Election Manifesto of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), which emphasises providing youth with the necessary skills for self-employment, rather than relying on the limited government job opportunities.\n\n\u201cOver the past 61 years, Zanzibar has seen remarkable progress in education, healthcare, infrastructure, ICT and more,\u201d Dr Mwinyi.\n\nHe added: \u201cGraduates from KIST have played a significant role in these advancements, particularly as engineers driving major infrastructural projects.\u201d\n\nHe urged the graduates to actively engage with communities both within and outside their immediate circles and to recognise the critical role KIST continues to play in Zanzibar\u2019s development.\n\nALSO READ: Mwinyi pledges to take Zanzibar to next level\n\nDr Mwinyi also highlighted two major projects initiated under his administration to enhance KIST\u2019s infrastructure and human resources.\n\nThe first project focuses on empowering youth for self-employment and employment in the Blue Economy sector, offering training in oil and gas, marine activities and the processing of marine and agricultural products.\n\nThe second project involves the renovation and expansion of KIST\u2019s facilities, including the construction of three engineering workshop buildings equipped with modern labs and 12 specialised workshops.\n\n\u201cThese projects will not only improve the learning environment but also ensure that graduates have the skills needed to secure employment in various sectors relevant to their fields of study,\u201d he explained."

            "article_content": "Cai Meng/China Daily\n\nThe Trump White House is likely to ignite another round of inflation in new trade and tech wars. And that could drive US-China ties to the edge.\n\nWho do I call when I want to talk to Europe? Kissinger once quipped highlighting the internal divides of the old continent. Today, he'd have a similar problem calling America.\n\nIn recent weeks, President Biden has yielded spotlight to Trump who has talked with foreign leaders like President Macron and Ukraine's Zelensky, while commenting on Syrian turmoil before Biden. After Trump's meetings with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, trade and immigration policy are already out of Biden's hands.\n\nSince 2021 Biden has missed the opportunity to reset Trump's policies. Now he could have used the transition period to warn Americans of the impending Trump's revolution, whick risks disrupting domestic politics and US-China ties.\n\nTrump's triple inflation risks\n\nIf the 2021-23 inflation surge in America killed Biden's second term by instigating widespread voter frustration, Trump's economic agenda is likely to pose a triple threat to US price stability.\n\nThe expected broad tax cuts will compound the already-huge federal deficits and debt, thereby exacerbating inflation. The possible effort to reduce the independence of the Federal Reserve would further foster inflation.\n\nThe second likely source of inflation would be the Trump's pledge to initiate the \"massive\" deportation process, alongside other restrictive immigration policies. Not only would that effort divide Americans, reinforce xenophobia and white nationalism, it would likely disrupt US labor markets, which rely on foreign-born workers, particularly in construction, agriculture and hospitality.\n\nAdditionally, such policies would encourage another ugly wave of anti-Asian sentiment that America witnessed in the Trump era and Biden's protectionism has continued to inflame. It would undermine Chinese immigrant talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Darkly reminiscent of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, America First translates to deporting the Chinese first. The Trump White House needs to scapegoat an \"enemy\" for its policy failures.\n\nThird, Trump seeks to integrate the barely-regulated cryptocurrencies into America's financial and fiscal systems thus opening the henhouse to crypto-foxes. It is a self-interested policy of the Trump oligarchs. The unregulated crypto-sphere, if fully executed, could cause high volatility in the financial markets. By potentially facilitating illicit activities such as money laundering, dark financing and diminishing the Fed's influence over the economy, it could disrupt the dollar hegemony in the world economy.\n\nHence, too, the president-elect's recent threat of 100% tariff on BRICS countries if they pursue creating new currency. In reality, the 34-country bloc is more interested in trading with their own local currencies than a bloc-wide currency. But Trump's economic coercion is a taste of things to come.\n\nTrade and technology wars\n\nSince American hegemony can no longer rely on US dominance in the increasingly multipolar world economy, Washington relies increasingly on trade wars, sanctions and geopolitics to retain that supremacy.\n\nIf the triple inflation threat associated with the Trump White House will materialize, the Fed will slow its rate cuts or return to tightening. That will push up the dollar, which could destabilize international currencies, including the Chinese yuan. When trade tensions take off, economic uncertainty and market volatility will increase worldwide, including Chinese stock market. As investors' risk appetite decreases, markets face downward pressures.\n\nThe Trump administration will exploit sanctions to decouple bilateral high-tech ties with China, especially by targeting semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum technology, possibly advanced manufacturing and biotech. Such measures increase costs in high-tech over time but won't immediately affect daily living costs in the US.\n\nHence the attractiveness of such measures to Trump's trade authorities, including the new trade representative Jamieson Greer, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of ex-trade czar Robert Lighthizer. Greer used to represent US Steel in a lawsuit against China. Rewarded for his loyalty in the Capitol attack four years ago, the Sinophobic Peter Navarro will be Trump's new senior counselor for trade and manufacturing.\n\nAlthough the tough-and-rough Lighthizer managed to sell tariffs to Wall Street during the Trump's first administration, he has now been played out. Treasury Secretary pick Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary selection Howard Lutnick and Kevin Hassett, the new head of the National Economic Council, are all seen as business-friendly establishment figures. But each supports tariff and tech wars as well.\n\nUnlike Lighthizer who saw tariffs as across-the-board duties to resolve America's chronic trade deficits, the Wall Streeters are more likely to use tariffs \"strategically\" on certain products and as a cudgel to coerce other nations to accede to Trump's demands.\n\nChina's counter-measures\n\nAs demonstrated by the just concluded Central Economic Work Conference, China has been preparing for Trump's trade wars. Among priorities for economic policy in 2025, policymakers emphasize the need to maintain stable growth, employment and commodity prices, through steps like higher deficit-to-GDP ratios, rate cuts and the issuance of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, China was the primary tariff target. Now Trump says he will enact a 25 percent tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office, and raise tariffs on goods from China by 10 percent. He has advocated 60-100 percent tariffs on imports from China and 10-20 percent tariffs on imports from all other countries, including allies. The \"spread effect\" could dilute some of the adverse impact on China. Moreover, like seven years ago, US importers have been busy trying to frontload their China purchases to reduce the impact of the impending tariffs. The proposed tariff effect is thus more likely to materialize in 2025-26.\n\nSecond, Chinese economy has changed. In 2017, it was more reliant on US as an export destination. For two decades, China was the top exporter of goods into the US and even in 2022 bilateral trade was still at a record high. Now Mexico has overtaken China's role. Today, the US attracts less than 15 percent of Chinese exports, whereas ASEAN and the EU account over 16 percent and less than 15 percent, respectively. The EU will seek to emulate the US tariffs, but prefers targeted rather than across-the-board tariffs.\n\nThird, China was more dependent on exports in 2017. Today, China is world-class science leader and benefits from more diversified innovation. I am currently touring in Guangdong's Greater Bay Area. In the \"Chinese Silicon Valley,\" research and development (R&D) as of GDP is over 2.4 percent; higher than in France. In Shenzhen, it is over 6.5 percent; more than in any country.\n\nTrue, China is still developing manufacturing processes for advanced semiconductors; a key target of US export controls. But now it is leading in electric vehicles, automotive software and lithium battery technology. Moreover, China's LNG shipbuilding and high-speed rail industries are on track to hit targets. It produces the world's most efficient and lowest-cost solar panels, along with innovative drugs.\n\nHardball or dialogue\n\nRecently, the Politburo, China's top decision-making body, opted to respond more actively to economic downturns, boost demand and stabilize the housing market. Fiscal easing is augmented by \"moderately loose\" monetary policy next year. The decision to foster \"unconventional\" counter-cyclical adjustments is the greatest policy shift since 2008.\n\nHowever, China too can play the tit-for-tat trade games, even if reluctantly. On Dec 2, Washington added more than 100 Chinese companies to a restricted trade list and banned the sale to China of some of the fastest semiconductors and the equipment to make them. China responded by banning US exports of rare minerals - gallium, germanium, and antimony - and other items.\n\nIt was the first time China included a broad ban on so-called transshipment in a government regulation on exports. US sources estimate the likely total cost from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at over $3 billion. Moreover, Beijing has begun an antimonopoly investigation into Nvidia, the US giant dominating the world market for the advanced chips needed for AI.\n\nDoes this mean China has opted for those geopolitical divides in the global economy that Trump and Biden have supported in the past seven years? No. It is a signal to the incoming Trump administration that unilateralism has no future in a multipolar global economy. It is still a move to begin dialogue - unless the Trump White House chooses otherwise.\n\nDr Dan Steinbock is the founder of Difference Group and has served at the India, China and America Institute (US), Shanghai Institute for International Studies (China) and the EU Center (Singapore).
