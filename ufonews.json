Fourth St.\n\nThese vehicles, which include things such as a replica of the 1960s Batmobile, a Delorean with a flux capacitor and even an \"invisible\" Boatmobile from the animated series \"Spongebob Squarepants,\" showcase a look at the most odd, weird and quirky things someone might see driving down the street.\n\n'Oddities' in Salina: A fun exhibition to curate\n\nMatthew Miller-Wells, the director of education for The Garage who worked on getting vehicles this exhibition, said it has been one of the more fun things to curate.\n\n\"There's just some weird, obscure stuff here,\" Miller-Wells said.\n\nIt's not only the 1995 \"ChewBaru,\" a Subaru Boxer covered with dental tools, dentures, toothbrushes and more, that excites Miller-Wells, but the rare vehicles that have gone out of style.\n\n\"The (K-Car) '83 LeBaron that's over there excites me just as much as like the (floating) Amphicar, because you just don't see those anymore,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to the words that have already been used to describe this show, like odd and weird, he said one word is going to stick with him as people visit.\n\n\"I think 'polarizing' could absolutely be one,\" he said. \"There are cars here that people will love to see and ones that people will be really confused and don't like.\n\n\"That's the fun of it, is that what is strange is subjective. Someone may think it makes no sense that a K-Car is in here, because they remember a time when they were everywhere.\"\n\nThe Garage, an automotive museum in downtown Salina, opened its latest exhibition this week: \"Oddities.\" The exhibition, which features such vehicles as the Batmobile, a UFO and an amphibious car, will be on display through the end of the year.\n\nWhen is 'Oddities' on display in Salina? How much is admission?\n\n\"Oddities\" is now open at The Garage for people to come and see.\n\nDaily general admission for the museum is $15, with discounts for seniors, students and military being $12.\n\nThe museum is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays.\n\nMemberships are also available beginning at $45 a year, with unlimited admission to the museum and other benefits included.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Salina Journal: Salina automobile museum's newest exhibit includes the weird and odd"

        "article_content": "Ominous images of a perfectly spherical UFO, seemingly dotted with yellow 'landing lights,' have left some researchers certain one is 'the first selfie with a UFO in history.'\n\nTaken by Brazilian UFO researcher and author Edie Meireles in 2011, the snaps show the apparent craft above a hiking trail to 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n,' a chilly waterfall in Brazil's high-altitude Chapada Diamantina National Park.\n\nWhat followed, at least, according to one of Meireles' UFO-hunting peers, was years of 'threats and intrigues' \u2014 with two members of their group 'killed by the military' and three more 'abducted.'\n\nAnd by Meireles' own account, his sighting in one of South America's most scenic ecological preserves led to a raid on his home by 'soldiers in camouflage and black.'\n\nPhotos, taken by Brazilian UFO researcher and author Edie Meireles in 2011 (pictured), show the an ominous apparent craft above a hiking trail to 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n' - a chilly waterfall in the South American nation's high-altitude Chapada Diamantina national park\n\nIn a recent, March 2022 post to the group UFOs Bahai on Facebook, Meireles boasted that his candid snap was 'the only selfie with a flying saucer.' Above, a second and less clear 'UFO selfie' from Meireles' alleged encounter with a flying orb in Chapada Diamantina national park\n\nWhat followed, at least, according to one of Meireles' UFO-hunting peers, was years of 'threats and intrigues' \u2014 with two members of their group 'killed by the military' and three more 'abducted.' Above, another photo from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nSkeptics on social media, however, have alleged that the photos are everything from 'sky lanterns' held aloft by hot air from candles to outright doctored images.\n\nDailyMail.com reached out to Meireles for further comment \u2014 but the researcher, who serves as admin for 'el Grupo de Pesquisa Tecnol\u00f3gica Extra Avan\u00e7ada' ('the Extra-Advanced Technology Research Group') on Facebook has not replied.\n\nBut, in a March 2022 post, Meireles boasted that his candid snaps were 'the only selfie with a flying saucer.'\n\nAnd, in a submission to Brazilian nonprofit Museu da Pessoa (Museum of the Person) the UFO researcher recounted his trips back to the national park for repeated, but less-well-documented, encounters with these UFOs and their occupants.\n\nThose expeditions, documented in his book Fieldworkers: Pesquisadores de Campo in 2016, according to Meireles, led to further unwanted encounters with the military.\n\n'The result of the interrogation was [...] Fractures: 4 left ribs and left knee [...] Perforation with bleeding in the left lung,' and worse, Meireles told the nonprofit.\n\n'I was hospitalized for 12 days at the Chapada Regional Hospital, in Seabra-Ba, my medical history is there for anyone who wants to investigate,' according to the Brazilian UFO researcher.\n\nMeireles' version of his UFO experiences at the national park, includes more surreal encounters with beings and a prophecy of global environmental cataclysm: 'a natural collapse, with a lack of renewable resources, drinking water, and wood for construction,' as he told the nonprofit museum.\n\nFact or fiction, his story has a fitting setting in Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park, established in September 1985 to protect a host of rare, endangered species native to these Atlantic Forest plateaus 3,000 feet about sea level.\n\nBrazil's giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), its giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) and Chaco eagle (Buteogallus coronatus) are all protected species that call the park home.\n\nAbove, another photo from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nAbove, lateral blur on the apparent craft appears to indicate a form of propulsion in another photo alleged to be from Meireles' 2011 UFO encounter\n\nAbove, another image of lateral blur on the apparent 'alien spacecraft' - which appears to indicate a form of propulsion in another image from Meireles' alleged 2011 UFO encounter\n\nOne account of the 2011 sighting, attributed to Meireles, described a UFO whose onboard devices or novel means of propulsion managed to either accidentally or intentionally leave him stranded in the park.\n\n'I got out of the car and photographed,' according to a Reddit posting quoting Meireles. 'It was an indescribable wonderful emotion to have photographed a UFO so clearly visible.'\n\nBut, the account continues: 'About 40 minutes later, still on the road, my car turned off, I braked, I tried to turn the key and nothing, absolutely nothing.\n\n'I saw a light on the hood and I looked up and there was a UFO standing on top of my car, I opened the door and ran,' the account continues.\n\n'I even stopped to take a Selfie with them. My car was towed by a tractor the next day, it burned all electrical parts.'\n\nThis version of his encounter states that Meireles was travelling to the historic district near the national park, Serra de Igat\u00fa, although a 2016 posting apparently by Meireles on Facebook asserts the images were taken on his was to the waterfall at the park known as 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n.'\n\nAbove, 'Mosquito Waterfall,' one of many waterfalls like the 'La cascada de la purificaci\u00f3n' from Meireles' UFO encounter, visited by tourists of Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nAbove, a final known image from Meireles' alleged 2011 UFO encounter, this time with less fog or low-lying cloud cover along the trail in Brazil's Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nAn aerial view of Chapada Diamantina National Park in Bahia state, Brazil\n\nAbove, tourists admire the 'Poco Encantado' (aka 'the Enchanted Well') a sunken, subterranean pool and tourist destination at Chapada Diamantina National Park\n\nSome champions of Meireles' UFO research have attributed the murky stories around his incredibly crisp and visually compelling photographs to the alleged hostile encounters with the military.\n\nH\u00e9lio Nunes de Camargo, the self-decribed founder of UFOs na Chapada \u2013 Centro Ufol\u00f3gico da Chapada Diamantina, wrote that Meireles' UFOs Bahai research group disbanded over the alleged military harassments and violence.\n\n'They are leaving UFOlogy to live their own lives away from threats and intrigues,' Nunes de Camargo wrote in a 2014 post to his group's Facebook page.\n\nThe UFO researcher recounted the deaths and abductions that UFOs Bahai is alleged to have faced, adding: 'They told me that families are suffering a lot and they don't want to make other families suffer.'\n\nOther UFO researchers online, however, have had trouble with this explanation.\n\n'The fact that he's [Meireles] still uploading those photos to his Facebook account every few months proves that might not be correct,' Reddit user spriz2 opined.\n\n'I've written to Edie multiple times on Facebook over the last year to try and gain more knowledge on this event,' the Redditer explained. 'He's ignored every message and comment.'\n\nOthers, however, not only found the case credible but believed they had seen this same UFO themselves.\n\n'Holy F***, this is identical to what I saw right before Covid hit,' one Redditer, who goes by ehtseeoh, said.\n\nThe poster said that the bottom of the craft he saw 'rotated when it glowed red with an orange center, and then it did a quick zig zag and it was gone,' making 'zero sound' as it vanished in an instant.\n\n'I screamed laughed and cried,' the poster said. 'FINALLY the orb I've been looking for online, this guy has a selfie with it haha.'\n\nDailyMail.com also reached out to noted UFO skeptic and computer programmer Mick West of Sacramento, California, who weighed-in saying: 'They look photoshopped to me, but could be practical effects.'\n\nThe prolific, skeptically minded, UFO researcher and former video game designer noted that UFO cases like this, with limited information like static images and inconsistent eye-witness testimony, should always be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n'In cases like this we need actual evidence that the photos are NOT fake before attempting to explain them,' West told DailyMail.com via email."

        "article_content": "The artificial intelligence-generated image of Taylor Swift endorsing Donald Trump, which the singer said inspired her to endorse Kamala Harris for president this week, came from an unlikely place.\n\nThe image, which caused controversy in August after being shared by the former president on Truth Social, originally circulated with text reading, \u201cTaylor wants you to vote for Joe Biden,\u201d and was posted in a pro-Biden Facebook group with just 8,000 members in December 2023. That post was viewed by NBC News. A reverse-image search conducted by NBC News did not find any earlier incidences of the image being posted online.\n\nAfter the pro-Biden image featuring the AI-generated Swift was first posted on Facebook, it began to travel around the pro-Biden internet, particularly among Gen X and baby boomer supporters of the then-candidate. The Facebook group it was initially posted in is largely a place for Democrats to share memes and information in support of Biden and against Trump.\n\nThe image also traveled to X and Instagram\u2019s messaging platform, Threads. S. E. Hinton, author of \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d shared it on X in December. It was posted in a liberal subreddit the same month.\n\n\u201cI am a Boomer for Biden,\u201d one X post of the image was captioned in January.\n\nThe image\u2019s creator, a Democrat, asked NBC News to keep his identity private, wanting to avoid backlash. Inspired by Swift\u2019s 2020 endorsement of Biden, he said he used a generative AI platform to create an image from the text prompt \u201cTaylor Swift as Uncle Sam,\u201d then used Photoshop to add text over it.\n\nGet Tri-state area news delivered to your inbox. Sign up for NBC New York's News Headlines newsletter.\n\nOn Aug. 17, around nine months after it was posted with the pro-Biden text, a pro-Trump X account with over 340,000 followers posted an edited version that read, \u201cTaylor wants you to vote for Donald Trump.\u201d The X account did not respond to a request for comment about whether it edited the image itself or where it came from. The next day, Trump posted a screenshot of the X post on his Truth Social account with the caption, \u201cI accept!\u201d\n\n\u201cI woke up one morning and I got a text message from somebody who sent me a picture of the altered version and said, \u2018Was this you?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yeah that\u2019s an altered version of my original,\u2019\u201d the person who created the AI image of Swift endorsing Biden told NBC News in a phone interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t think much of it until I sat down and started looking at the news. It started blowing up from there, with people saying Taylor might sue him and I thought, \u2018Holy crap, what did I do?\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, after the presidential debate between Trump and Harris, Swift posted an endorsement for Harris on Instagram. In the caption, she cited the AI-generated image Trump posted as one of the reasons why she wanted to make her stance known publicly.\n\n\u201cRecently I was made aware that AI of \u2018me\u2019 falsely endorsing Donald Trump\u2019s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation,\u201d Swift wrote. \u201cIt brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.\u201d\n\nSwift included a link to the official voter registration website in the Instagram Story announcing her endorsement. In the 24 hours that followed, more than 400,000 people clicked the link from her account.\n\n\u201cI agree with Taylor that AI, when used by bad actors, can be a danger to democracy,\u201d the AI image creator said. \u201cIf this leads to stronger regulation, I\u2019m not only happy to comply, but I\u2019ll be happy that it makes the world a safer place.\u201d\n\nThe AI image creator, an artist, said he initially started experimenting with AI to stay in step with technological advancement he perceived as a threat to his career. He said he realized it could be a useful way to create political satire.\n\nHis public Facebook group is where he posts content in support of Democrats, starting with Biden\u2019s presidential campaign in 2020 and now in support of Harris\u2019 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would go down this way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe intent of it was to boost support for Joe Biden because his communication was poor and his polls were low and Trump was a looming threat and I just couldn\u2019t stand idly by.\u201d\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.

Learn More\n\nMicrosoft has unveiled a groundbreaking benchmark called Windows Agent Arena (WAA) to test artificial intelligence agents in realistic Windows operating system environments. This new platform aims to accelerate the development of AI assistants capable of performing complex computer tasks across diverse applications.\n\nPublished on arXiv.org, the research addresses critical challenges in evaluating AI agent performance. \u201cLarge language models show remarkable potential to act as computer agents, enhancing human productivity and software accessibility in multi-modal tasks that require planning and reasoning,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cHowever, measuring agent performance in realistic environments remains a challenge.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Windows Agent Arena in action: AI agents tackle diverse computer tasks, evaluated rapidly through Azure cloud technology. The system aims to advance human-computer interaction. (Credit: Microsoft Research)\n\nWindows Agent Arena: A virtual playground for AI assistants\n\nWindows Agent Arena provides a reproducible testing ground where AI agents interact with common Windows applications, web browsers, and system tools, mirroring human user experiences. The platform includes over 150 diverse tasks spanning document editing, web browsing, coding, and system configuration.\n\nA key innovation of WAA is its ability to parallelize testing across multiple virtual machines in Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud. \u201cOur benchmark is scalable and can be seamlessly parallelized in Azure for a full benchmark evaluation in as little as 20 minutes,\u201d the paper states. This dramatically accelerates the development cycle compared to traditional sequential testing that could take days.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Windows Agent Arena, a new benchmark for AI agents, simulates real-world Windows tasks across various applications. The platform allows for rapid testing and evaluation of AI assistants, potentially accelerating the development of more sophisticated human-computer interactions. (Credit: Microsoft Research)\n\nNavi: Microsoft\u2019s new AI agent takes on human-level tasks\n\nTo showcase the platform\u2019s capabilities, Microsoft introduced a new multi-modal AI agent called Navi. In tests, Navi achieved a 19.5% success rate on WAA tasks, compared to a 74.5% success rate for unassisted humans. These results highlight both the progress made and the challenges that remain in developing AI that can match human capabilities in operating computers.\n\nRogerio Bonatti, lead author of the study, said, \u201cWindows Agent Arena provides a realistic and comprehensive environment for pushing the boundaries of AI agents. By making our benchmark open source, we hope to accelerate research in this critical area across the AI community.\u201d\n\nThe release of WAA comes amid intensifying competition among tech giants to develop more capable AI assistants that can automate complex computer tasks. Microsoft\u2019s focus on the Windows environment could give it an edge in enterprise scenarios, where Windows remains the dominant operating system.\n\nNavi, Microsoft\u2019s new AI agent, as it confronts a typical Windows task in the Windows Agent Arena: installing the Pylance extension in Visual Studio Code. This demonstrates how AI agents are being trained to navigate common software environments. (Credit: Microsoft Research)\n\nBalancing innovation and ethics in AI agent development\n\nWhile the potential benefits of AI agents like Navi are significant, the development of such technologies raises important ethical considerations. As these agents become more sophisticated, they will have unprecedented access to users\u2019 digital lives, potentially interacting with sensitive personal and professional information across various applications.\n\nThe ability of AI agents to operate freely within a Windows environment \u2013 accessing files, sending emails, or modifying system settings \u2013 underscores the need for robust security measures and clear user consent protocols. There\u2019s a delicate balance to strike between empowering AI to assist users effectively and maintaining user privacy and control over their digital domains.\n\nMoreover, as AI agents become more capable of mimicking human-like interactions with computer systems, questions arise about transparency and accountability. Users may need to be clearly informed when they are interacting with an AI versus a human, especially in professional or high-stakes scenarios. The potential for AI agents to make consequential decisions or actions on behalf of users also raises liability concerns that will need to be addressed as the technology matures.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s decision to open-source the Windows Agent Arena is a positive step towards collaborative development and scrutiny of these technologies. However, it also means that potentially less scrupulous actors could use the platform to develop AI agents with malicious intent, highlighting the need for ongoing vigilance and perhaps regulation in this rapidly evolving field.\n\nAs WAA accelerates the development of more capable AI agents, it will be crucial for researchers, ethicists, policymakers, and the public to engage in ongoing dialogue about the implications of these technologies. The benchmark not only measures technological progress but also serves as a reminder of the complex ethical landscape we must navigate as AI becomes an increasingly integral part of our digital lives."

        "article_content": "The latest iPhones, look virtually identical to last year\u2019s models. But Apple hopes that what\u2019s underneath \u2014 new software that brings what it describes as artificial intelligence to the new phones \u2014 will convince people to upgrade.\n\nApple Intelligence, the company\u2019s new suite of AI services, automates tasks including image generation, rewriting emails and summarizing web articles.\n\nOnly the iPhone 16s or last year\u2019s iPhone 15 Pro can run the new software because older models are too slow to handle those tasks, according to the company.\n\nBut what if I told you there\u2019s another way to get the same perks?\n\nLong before Apple introduced Apple Intelligence at a software conference in June, many apps for automatically producing text and images had been widely available.\n\nRelying on a technology known as generative AI, which predicts what words and images belong together to write a catchy poem or generate a realistic-looking image of a cat on a windowsill, for instance, these types of services have been trendy for the last two years.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBy downloading a handful of apps, iPhone owners can get similar benefits and hold on to their older devices longer.\n\nAfter testing dozens of generative AI apps in the last year, here are my recommendations.\n\nSummarizing Text\n\nOne of Apple Intelligence\u2019s most anticipated features is its ability to take large blocks of text and distill the main points into a few sentences. This capability could be useful for summarizing a lengthy web article or lecture notes.\n\nBut there\u2019s already a popular tool for summarizing web articles: Arc Search, a free browser developed by a startup.\n\nTo test it, I loaded an 8,000-word feature from ProPublica about a chemist who blew the whistle on the manufacturer 3M. When I pinched the screen, the app generated a one-sentence overview of what the article was about, followed by three bullet points summing up the highlights. While the bullet points glossed over important details you would have gotten from reading the full article, I found the summary accurate.\n\nFor summarizing notes, the free web app Humata AI has become popular among academic researchers and lawyers. By visiting Humata.ai on a web browser, you can upload a document such as a PDF, and from there, you can type requests in a window to ask a chatbot to summarize the most important points. In response, the chatbot will show a digital copy of the PDF and highlight relevant portions of the text.\n\nWriting Tools\n\nApple Intelligence also includes tools to rewrite text \u2014 to make an email sound more professional, for instance. Lots of free apps can handle this task proficiently.\n\nThe most well known include the ChatGPT chatbot from OpenAI, along with rivals like Gemini from Google and Bing AI from Microsoft \u2014 all apps that can be downloaded in the App Store. Just paste text into the app and ask the chatbot to rewrite it in a different tone by typing, for instance, \u201cMake this email sound more personable for a client I\u2019ve known for many years.\u201d\n\nFor help with writing, I prefer a lesser-known tool called Wordtune, from the startup AI21 Labs. Its interface, accessible on wordtune.com, is designed like a word processor for composing and editing text. You can type in a paragraph and click on buttons to expand, shorten or rewrite sentences to sound more casual or formal; the app will show a list of rewritten sentences to choose from.\n\nImage Generation\n\nAnother of Apple Intelligence\u2019s hyped features is its ability to generate fun images, such as an emoji of yourself eating pizza, to send to friends.\n\nMany options for generating images exist, including a tool that most iPhone users are likely to already have: Meta AI, Meta\u2019s free chatbot that is included inside Instagram, WhatsApp and its other apps. In the search bar at the top of Instagram, you can ask the chatbot to conjure images by typing \u201c/imagine\u201d followed by a description.\n\nI typed \u201c/imagine me eating steak.\u201d Meta AI then loaded a tool to take photos of my face from multiple angles. It produced an obviously fake rendering of me salivating over a large, rare steak inside a restaurant.\n\nOther similar tools for typing prompts to generate images include Adobe Firefly, found on firefly.adobe.com, and ChatGPT.\n\nPhoto Editing\n\nAnother new Apple Intelligence tool can automatically remove photo bombers with the tap of a button.\n\nGoogle has offered a similar editing tool, Magic Eraser, inside its Google Photos photo album app for iPhone and Android users since 2023.\n\nInside Google Photos, select your photo, tap the \u201cedit\u201d button and select the Magic Eraser tool. You can then circle the distracting objects or people you would like to erase.\n\nI used Magic Eraser on a photo of my corgi, Max, in a dog park \u2014 to remove a citation form from a police officer for letting Max run off leash without a permit. It replaced the maddening piece of bureaucracy with some pine needles.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times."

        "article_content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Can artificial intelligence be an effective wingman?\n\nRoman Khaves, co-founder and CEO of Rizz, thinks so. The AI dating assistant app analyzes screenshots of conversations you\u2019re having on other platforms \u2014 from Tinder to iMessage \u2014 and crafts reply suggestions. Rizz has amassed millions of downloads since launching in 2022, with more and more competition also emerging into the dating scene since.\n\nKhaves recently spoke with The Associated Press about the demand for this kind of platform, how AI is being used to find in-person connections, and what guardrails are needed to bring AI technology into such an intimate part of our lives. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nQ: How does Rizz work?\n\nA: Rizz is an AI dating assistant. If you\u2019re stuck in a conversation or you don\u2019t know how to open up on a dating app, you can pull out Rizz and upload a screenshot of a particular profile or conversation that you\u2019re having trouble with on that other platform. It will give you tons of suggested replies \u2014 and also a strategy on how you could start the conversation or respond to certain things.\n\nThe more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you like. And that trains the model to improve over time.\n\nQ: Why launch this kind of app?\n\nA: Three years ago, I personally found myself stuck in the middle of dating app conversations. Sometimes, I would take a screenshot to send to some of my friends and say, \u201cHey, what do I say next?\u201d And we knew there had to be a better way.\n\nThe moment that ChatGPT hit the scene, that\u2019s when we launched Rizz. We integrated the API technology with our product to make it possible. And we saw immediate traction. We\u2019ve had over 7.5 million downloads to date, growing about 30% month over month, since launching in 2022. There\u2019s clear demand for this type of product.\n\nQ: Who are your biggest competitors?\n\nA: I\u2019d say at least 40% of our screenshots and conversations come from messaging apps like iMessage and Instagram. We get a lot of Instagram, which I would argue is the biggest dating app in the world today \u2014 and Instagram recently added an AI feature that can give you different variations of how to rephrase a message, like more funny or witty suggestions.\n\nSo, for now, Instagram is a huge competitor. Tinder also has suggested openers. It\u2019s still very different than what we do \u2014 we take it a step further and we give users a strategy \u2014 but I think those are the biggest competitors, as well as ChatGPT. And there\u2019s many similar apps now and new ones emerging every single day.\n\nQ: What would you say to folks who may be concerned about bringing AI into their dating life? Where do there need to be guardrails?\n\nA: We\u2019re not trying to replace human connection. We\u2019re just trying to help people get to the date in the first place \u2014 because it is hard out there. A lot of people don\u2019t even know how to start conversations online, and I think AI is helping boost that confidence.\n\nStill, privacy and control is critical in this new world of AI. We could have built Rizz very differently. We could have made it so that Rizz would respond automatically or connect to the dating apps \u2014 but we don\u2019t do any of that. All users are in control of exactly what gets sent out to their match. And we are going to continue building with these priorities in mind.\n\nQ: What\u2019s next for AI and dating?\n\nA: A lot of the big dating companies are thinking about how to leverage AI in order to enhance human connection in this space today. That\u2019s also what we set out to do, and are still improving on.\n\nRizz is currently built to help you get off dating apps as quickly as possible. Next, we might want to help you beyond the first date, perhaps with future date ideas or something like birthday gift ideas. It\u2019s really about supporting the user throughout their journey."

Visit North Carolina unveils First in Fright, a new campaign that highlights otherworldly points of interest from the cloud-shrouded Great Smoky Mountains to the Graveyard of the Atlantic.\n\nVisit North Carolina logo\n\nThe campaign features an 8-part \"First in Fright\" podcast, a new NC Haunted Trail and hotels that speak to encounters between living souls and figures (real or imagined) from other realms. From today's initial release of tales, seekers can sign up for future revelations at NCFirstInFright.com and expand what they know about mysterious lights, recurring sights and unexplained sounds that have long been reported.\n\n\"The timing might scream 'Halloween,' but the spirit of First in Fright rises from age-old narratives instead of costumes and props,\" said Wit Tuttell, executive director of Visit NC. \"The lore surrounding the Brown Mountain Lights near Morganton dates back centuries, and other stories have been retold for decades. It takes more skepticism than I can muster to dismiss the accounts, even if they're impossible to prove.\"\n\nThe First in Fright podcast directs intrepid travelers to places whose stories have endured attempts to explain them away. A Haunted Trail winds through Mountain Mysteries, the Paranormal Piedmont and the Creepy Coast. As they make their way through these regions, travelers can look into Spooky Stays for hotels where long-term guests have never checked out. For those in search of seasonal scares, a rundown of Halloween attractions and events addresses the quest.\n\n\"For anyone intrigued by ghosts, stories are the starting point,\" said Tuttell, who has stayed in the \"Pink Lady Room\" at Asheville's Omni Grove Park Inn (see Mountain Mysteries). \"The podcasts bring the mysteries to life while letting listeners decide what to believe and what to dismiss.\"\n\nWrapped in immersive sound design, the eight podcast segments feature local storytellers and first-hand accounts from the people who experienced them. Episode themes include Carolina Cryptids, Unexplained Phenomena, Old North Witches and Traveling Terrors. Among the stories that await:\n\nThe Devil's Tramping Ground, a strangely barren clearing near Siler City. Curious campers can reserve a spot near the perfect circle of a site that some say is cursed by the devil himself.\n\nBattleship North Carolina, a well-decorated World War II vessel moored in Wilmington. Frequent paranormal reports have emerged: hatches mysteriously opening, lights switched on and off, and the appearance of a young sailor in the washroom. Beyond regular tours, travelers can watch for special events such as those offered this fall by Haunted Rooms of America.\n\nBrown Mountain Lights, a phenomenon that unfolds over Linville Gorge near Morganton. For hundreds of years, the appearance of mysterious lights have been described as rising above the peaks of Linville Gorge. The size, shape and color often change. Viewer guides are available at the Discover Burke visitor center downtown.\n\nMadison Dry Goods, a shop in downtown Madison that owes its popularity in part to its museum, which occupies a former funeral parlor space on the second floor. Hauntings tied to a family's murder in 1929 have been reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe free podcast, with episodes being released today and Oct. 1, can be accessed at NCFirstInFright.com or through Apple, Spotify and other major streaming platforms.\n\n\"North Carolina is known for being 'First in Flight,'\" Tuttell said. \"We're excited that travelers will now recognize our state as 'First in Fright' as well.\"\n\nPhotos: Find photos and graphic for download here.\n\nAbout Visit North Carolina:\n\nVisit North Carolina is part of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina, a private nonprofit corporation that serves as North Carolina's economic development organization. The EDPNC focuses on business and job recruitment, existing industry support, international trade, tourism and film marketing.\n\nThe mission of Visit NC is to unify and lead the state in positioning North Carolina as a preferred destination for leisure travel, group tours, meetings and conventions, sports events and film production. Each year, North Carolina welcomes about 43 million visitors who spend nearly $36 billion during their stay.

A code does not guarantee tickets. Tickets will be sold on a first come first served basis.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the news ticketless fans had hoped to hear, with many taking to social media to vent their frustration.\n\n\u201c'I am so so sad - in the ballot but no code and 9 hours in ticket master queues,\u201d wrote one person on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely devastated\u201d agreed a second.\n\n\u201cNever been to a concert in my life and yours is the only one I ever wanted to go to,\u201d lamented a third.\n\nIt comes after many fans were shocked by standard tickets for the reunion tour more than doubling from \u00a3148 to \u00a3355 on Ticketmaster, prompting the Government and the UK\u2019s competition watchdog to pledge they will look into the use of dynamic pricing.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday the band said they hoped the new private ballot ticket sale strategy would make \u201cthe process far smoother for fans by reducing the stress and time it takes\u201d to obtain tickets.\n\nSaturday\u2019s sale for the extra two Wembley days will be broken into three slots across the day, running from 8.30am to 10am, 12pm to 1.30pm and 3.30pm to 5pm.\n\nSadly, that doesn\u2019t appear to have been the experience for many.\n\nOthers who were successful, including 17-year-old Nathan Palmer, expressed their excitement at securing a ballot code but worried at how tough the competition will be on Saturday to secure a ticket.\n\nHe previously queued for four Oasis tickets but \u201cby the time we got through the queue, Ticketmaster had already raised the prices from \u00a3140 to \u00a3360 each and we all thought that was way too much to be paying so we didn\u2019t get any\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cWe all signed up to this new presale ballot and only one of us got the code but on the email it says that the ticket prices will be definitely set between \u00a375-\u00a3200 which is more reasonable so we have a bit more hope that we will get tickets this time.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s sale for the extra two Wembley days will be broken into three slots across the day, running from 8.30am to 10am, 12pm to 1.30pm and 3.30pm to 5pm."

See our methodology for more information on how we choose the best bad credit small business loan lenders.\n\nOur methodology\n\nTo determine which small business loans offer the best financing for business startup costs, CNBC Select analyzed a dozen U.S. loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar lenders. For this roundup, we didn't evaluate business lines of credit, invoice factoring/financing, merchant cash advances since they either have a long application process (like SBA loans) or act differently than a traditional term loan, which gives you a lump sum that you pay back over a fixed time period. We compared each small business loan on a range of features, including: Minimum and maximum loan amounts\n\nLength of term\n\nCredit score needed\n\nApplication requirements\n\nStreamlined application process\n\nFund disbursement\n\nCustomer support\n\nBetter Business Bureau rating\n\nCustomer reviews, when available The rates and fee structures for small business loans are subject to change without notice, and they often fluctuate in accordance with the prime rate. However, once you accept your loan agreement, a fixed-rate APR will guarantee that the interest rate and monthly payment will remain consistent throughout the entire term of the loan. Your APR, monthly payment and loan amount depend on your credit history and creditworthiness. To take out a small business loan, lenders will conduct a hard credit inquiry and request a full application, which could require both personal and business proof of income, identity verification, proof of address and more. You'll likely also need to put up collateral, which can include business equipment, real estate or personal assets.

As more educational institutions move towards online platforms, there is an increased need for experts who can design, develop, and facilitate engaging virtual learning experiences. E-learning has also become essential in corporate training programs, further increasing the demand for professionals with expertise in this area.\n\nAdditionally, many companies are investing heavily in their online presence and digital marketing strategies. This has led to a surge in job openings for web developers, content creators, social media managers, and other roles related to building an effective online presence. As businesses continue to shift towards e-commerce models and remote work environments due to COVID-19, these positions will remain vital for success.\n\nAnother growing trend that presents significant job opportunities is artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
