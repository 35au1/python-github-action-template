        "article_content": "Game Theory: UFO 50 is a massive trove of twists on old-school gaming genius Scroll until you find a title that sounds cool; you may hit something that'll be one of your favorite games of 2024.\n\nWhen approaching a video game project like Mossmouth\u2019s new release UFO 50\u2014an absolutely massive labor of love that is brilliant, frustrating, fun, mysterious, artistically ambitious, and sometimes just really fucking frustrating\u2014it helps to start from base principles. So: UFO 50, released on Steam this week, is a collection of 50 games of varying length and complexity, all purportedly from a fictional 1980s video game developer called UFOSoft. The games in the collection, which are presented in a fake chronological order built around the loosely sketched history of the company, largely draw their inspirations from the library of the Nintendo Entertainment System; amidst more esoteric or complicated pastiches, you can find games that serve as fairly straight homages to River City Rampage, Uninvited, Solar Jetman, Dragon Quest, and many more. There are meta elements operating to the side of the main draw\u2014notes on the games\u2019 fake development, a terminal that lets you go digging for secrets, markers that indicate when you\u2019ve completed individual titles\u2014but the focus has clearly been put on the games themselves, which were developed (in our world) by the Mossmouth team, including Spelunky creator Derek Yu.\n\nThe obvious comparison point for all this, at least for nerds of a certain vintage, will be clear: Cult Nintendo DS title Retro Game Challenge (and its sadly never-exported-from-Japan sequel), which pulled this same basic \u201cfake games from fake consoles from a fake past\u201d conceit back in 2007. Players who come to UFO 50 looking for a direct recreation of that experience might come away a little disappointed, though: Where that game prided itself on building up the fiction surrounding its faux games, complete with fake manuals and fake magazines for players to peruse in between playing its riffs on Mario or Galaga, UFO 50 is a bit more barebones in its presentation. (You get a few sentences of notes per game, and that\u2019s about it.) Given a choice between putting their emphasis on the games, or on the materials surrounding them, the small Mossmouth team understandably focused on function over form; we might wish for a more lush package, but it honestly feels churlish to complain, when the actual content of the collection is far more expansive than we\u2019ve had time to even come close to coming to terms with.\n\nAs to that content: We wish we could declare each of UFO 50\u2032s 50 games a retro-indie masterpiece, each one preserving what worked from classic game design while jettisoning the chaff, but, uh\u2026 No. Don\u2019t get us wrong: There are extremely good games in here, some more than worth the collection\u2019s $25 asking price all on their own. (We have lost too many hours this past week already to arena shooter Overbold, or mechanically gorgeous dungeon crawler Valbrace.) But many of the games in the collection feel torn between their desire to stay true to the clunky, frequently unfair controls of console ages past, and being genuinely fun games. Yes, it feels authentic that Barbuta, the very first game in the collection, happily wipes your progress every time you lose all your lives, erasing what could be 20 minutes of very fussy trap and dungeon navigation. Whether it\u2019s fun is a much thornier question.\n\nBut while we can\u2019t champion UFO 50 as 50 instant masterpieces, we also can\u2019t paint it with the broad brush of being uniformly old-school ornery for its old sake\u2014or a nostalgia exercise with no appeal for players who didn\u2019t grow up pulling battered NES carts off the rental wall of their local video store. The truth is that this really is 50 different games, each with their own control schemes and design hooks, and the quality is inevitably going to vary. Part of the fun of the package, in fact, is in that kind of discovery: For every game you play five minutes of before concluding \u201cEh, not for me,\u201d you\u2019re just as likely to run into something like the boldly strange Mooncat, or \u201cWhat if we\u2019d invented tower defense games on the NES\u201d hypothetical Rock On! Island. At the bare minimum, each title has something genuinely clever powering it, whether it\u2019s Mortol\u2018s attempt to build an action game out of Lemmings DNA, or Avianos\u2018 bird-based war gaming. Half the time, when we caught ourselves thinking \u201cOkay, we get it, let\u2019s move on\u201d after poking around at a game, we turned out to be basically right; the other half, though, we inevitably stumbled into some new secret or twist of play that deepened the experience of an individual title.\n\nUFO 50 is, in other words, a game that trusts you, the player, to find the fun\u2014with the promise that there is a lot of fun to be found in this odd, massive toy chest. We should note that the game does have a few curation tools\u2014if you scroll down to the bottom of the collection, you can filter games by whether they\u2019re meant to be more reflex based, or cerebral, for instance, or focus in on the title\u2019s large number of same-screen multiplayer games. (Breaking free of the chronology is a good idea in any case; although UFO 50 doesn\u2019t pay as much attention to the \u201ccomplexity increases as fictional time passes\u201d conceit that powered Retro Game Challenge, you\u2019ll still tend to find more robust experiences closer to the end of UFOSoft\u2019s fictional lifespan.) We\u2019re sure we\u2019ll soon see a cottage industry of guides and wider critiques pointing out hidden gems buried in its library. But honestly, we recommend just doing what the game itself advises: Scroll through until you find a title that sounds cool, blow off the fictional dust, and take a gamble on the chance you\u2019ll hit something that\u2019ll be one of your favorite games of 2024."

We love the retro-themed PS5 Pro, have some problems with The Plucky Squire, weighed in on the Space Marine 2 controversy, and spent seven hours with Dragon Age: Inquisition. Check out all of our opinions for this week in games.\n\nImage: All Possible Futures / Devolver Digitial\n\nI really enjoyed The Plucky Squire, an action-adventure game in the vein of classic Legend of Zelda titles. It\u2019s got not one, but two, whimsical art styles: one reminiscent of children\u2019s picture books, and another in which the hero is presented as a miniature toy that comes to life in a child\u2019s bedroom. The game is most often presented in the former, where screen transitions are accompanied by the turning of a page, and the middle of most stages appropriately folds where they meet. The eponymous hero goes on many adventures with his friends Violet and Thrash, who each embody noble and righteous virtues, while triumphantly defeating the forces of evil time and time again. At the close of these journeys, the Plucky Squire comes home and writes about it all, because naturally he\u2019s also a bestselling author in the land of Mojo. It\u2019s a game with all the fixings of a kids\u2019 classic, something that can be shared with the children in one\u2019s life to encourage them to dream big and boldly. As I played the game, though, I did find myself wishing that The Plucky Squire actually believed in its audience as much as it claims to. - Moises Taveras Read More\n\nImage: Sony\n\nSony is marking the 30th anniversary of PlayStation with a new lineup of limited-edition, PS1-inspired consoles and accessories and they look surprisingly good, especially for those of us who still have fond memories of listening to the disc spin in the original console while grinding through our favorite \u201890s RPG late at night. - Ethan Gach Read More\n\nImage: Saber Interactive / Focus Entertainment\n\nWarhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, made by Saber Interactive, is the sequel to a beloved 2011 shooter and has been praised for, among other things, feeling like an old-school Xbox 360-era game. But some have marshaled that classic mystique into a rebuke of modern games that don\u2019t conform to certain views they have about who gaming is for and what it needs to be good. - Ethan Gach Read More\n\nScreenshot: BioWare / Kotaku\n\nI have been waiting for Dragon Age: The Veilguard for 10 years. The last game developer BioWare put out was 2019\u2019s Anthem, an ill-fated loot shooter that chased live-service trends and felt like a misuse of the team\u2019s talents. In the years since, there have been reports and admissions from the studio that the fourth entry in the studio\u2019s fantasy RPG franchise had undergone multiple revamps, including pivoting away from a live-service, multiplayer-driven game in 2021. At a glance, The Veilguard, with its emphasis on narrative and on the multiple well-developed, three-dimensional companions you can befriend or romance, seems like a strategic shift back to core principles for a studio that has been fumbling to find its voice again. - Kenneth Shepard Read More\n\nImage: Mossmouth\n\nEfforts to preserve, spotlight, and celebrate important games of the past have been gaining steam in recent years. Consider, for instance, Digital Eclipse\u2019s Atari 50, a compilation of games from across that company\u2019s history that provides wonderful context in the form of interviews and archival materials, illuminating their colossal impact on gaming. Now, we have another such compilation: UF0 50, a collection of 50 games from UFO Soft, the business-software-maker-turned-game-developer that, across the 1980s, was responsible for dozens of gems which simultaneously reflected the larger gaming trends of the time, while also innovating and pushing the medium forward in their own right. There\u2019s just one small but crucial detail here, however, that sets UFO 50 apart from any other such compilations: UFO Soft never actually existed. - Carolyn Petit Read More\n\nImage: Nintendo / Kotaku\n\nIf you listen closely, it feels like you can hear the jingle of plastic and metal for Nintendo\u2019s next console as its manufactured and assembled in faraway factories. You can almost sense its launch lineup coming into focus as the company\u2019s developers prepare to put their finishing touches on whimsical new experiments. Rumors and speculation around a supposed Switch 2 have reached a fever pitch as fans await a possible official reveal any week now. So it\u2019s our last chance to share our hopes and predictions for the new hardware before dreams become reality. Here\u2019s what we want from a Switch 2, and what we think we\u2019ll actually get. - Ethan Gach Read More\n\nImage: Sony / Kotaku / Sean Gladwell (Getty Images)\n\nAstro Bot is one of the most entertaining and depressing games I\u2019ve played in ages. It\u2019s a loud, unrestrained explosion of creative energy, it\u2019s an antiseptic corporate product drowning in brand fellatio. A shining example of what current-gen first-party games can be, a dreary reminder of everything they\u2019re not. PlayStation is dead; long live PlayStation. - Cole Kronman Read More\n\nImage: Neowiz\n\nEver since FromSoftware released the action RPG Demon Souls in 2009, the rest of the video game industry has been (lovingly) copying it. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, as the saying goes. Amongst a wealth of solid takes on the genre, last year\u2019s dark fantasy title Lies of P stands out as one of the best. Not only does the game expertly emulate what fans love about the Souls genre, but it also iterates on its formula in exciting ways. Though one year after its release, what I find most charming about Lies of P is just how enthralling its absurd premise actually is. - Willa Rowe Read More\n\nGif: BioWare / Kotaku\n\nEarlier this month, myself and several other content creators and members of the press got to go hands-on with BioWare\u2019s long-anticipated RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard. I came away from my seven hours with it really impressed with what feels like the most cohesive game BioWare has put together since probably 2012\u2019s Mass Effect 3. And part of that time was spent exploring the capabilities of the game\u2019s character creator, with which we had full freedom. - Kenneth Shepard Read More\n\nImage: Devolver Digital\n\nMaking a sequel to an amazing game is hard enough, but with each subsequent entry that task gets even harder. So while 1991's point-and-click adventure game Monkey Island 2 is seen as a stunning improvement over its predecessor, the more the series went on, the harder it was to recapture the original sparkle. That is partially due to changing taste in games over the years and who was actually behind its development, but the sentiment still stands. So when Return to Monkey Island, the sixth game in the franchise, released two years ago on September 19, 2022, over three decades after the original, there was no telling what we were going to get. And yet, Return to Monkey Island might just be the best game in the series to date. - Willa Rowe Read More\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

        "category": "ai+app",
        "date": "19h",
        "source": "USA Today",
        "article_content": "Prakash Sangam\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThis story was updated to correct a byline.\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: Due to a production error, an earlier version of this story inadvertently included the wrong byline. It has been corrected.\n\nIf you are looking to buy a new laptop for this school year or as a gift during the holiday season, you will be faced with a major decision: Should you buy a next-generation AI-powered Copilot+ PC? However, the recent flurry of announcements by laptop OEMs and chip providers that power them has made that decision almost a misnomer.\n\nWhat is a Copilot+ PC, and why do you need it?\n\nCopilot+ PCs are a new breed of laptops with significant on-device (Generative) Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities. To get this moniker from Windows provider Microsoft, laptops must meet or exceed specific minimum AI processing requirements. For the technically inclined, the requirement is to have a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) with at least 40 TOPS (Trillion Operations Per Second) processing power. Copilot+ PCs offer a full day or more battery life, lightning-fast performance, enhanced user experience and are very thin, light and sleek.\n\nCurrently, most of the AI processing happens in the cloud, which means all your information, be it your interaction with ChatGPT or text-to-image creation with many tools, is sent to the cloud. However, with Copilot+ PCs, most of that processing happens on the device. That means your data remains private and securely stored in the device. Additionally, on-device AI is more accurate, personalized, relevant and almost free. If you want more details on this, please check my articles here and here.\n\nEven if you are not looking to use AI, you have to buy Copilot+ PCs, as they are the best of the breed, most secure and best-looking laptops in the market today, outperforming anything else, even Apple\u2019s MacBook.\n\nAll Copilot+ PCs are not created equal\n\nCopilot+ PCs have a lot of variances in terms of the chip platforms, various configurations of those platforms, many OEMs, price and performance tiers and more. It all started when the smartphone technology giant Qualcomm joined Microsoft and scores of PC OEMs to introduce the first Copilot+ PCs based on its Snapdragon XElite and XPlus platforms in May of this year. They set a new bar for laptop performance.\n\nFollowing Qualcomm, the personal computing giant Intel and AMD introduced their Copilot+ PC platforms. Intel\u2019s platform is called Core Ultra 200V (project name Lunar Lake), and AMD\u2019s is called Ryzen AI300. Many OEMs announced laptops with these platforms at the recently concluded European consumer show IFA.\n\nThere are some key differences between Qualcomm and Intel/AMD platforms. Qualcomm platforms are designed using the technology from Arm, a British company. This technology has been used in smartphones for over twenty years and is known for its exceptional power efficiency. Qualcomm introduced this for PC platforms to achieve path-breaking battery life and thin, light and sleek designs, and it set the target for other vendors. Because it is new, the Arm for Windows app ecosystem is still developing. Almost all essential apps are supported, but some apps, especially some games, may not yet be supported.\n\nIntel and AMD platforms are based on X86 technology, which has been around for over 30 years, so app compatibility is not the issue. However, the Core Ultra 200V and Ryzen AI300 are new designs, and their performance is not yet proven.\n\nSo, when choosing Copilot+ PCs, along with price points, features and others, users must also be aware of the platforms used on those PCs. For reference, here is my review of Lenovo\u2019s Yoga Slim 7x.\n\nUSA TODAY Home Internet:See the best and most reliable broadband plans in your area\n\nWhy is it a good time to buy them now?\n\nTechnology is akin to waves in the ocean \u2014 by the time one reaches shore, another one is ready just behind it. If you want to get the maximum benefits of the latest technology, you must jump in when it is reasonably mature, with ample choices in the market. Copilot+ PCs are exactly at that stage now.\n\nAlmost all PC OEMs now offer Copilot+ PCs, including Lenovo, Dell, HP, Samsung, Microsoft, Asus, Acer and many others. They are available for both consumer and enterprise segments at all price points. For example, PC market leader Lenovo has ThinkPad for enterprises, Yoga for premium consumers, IdeaPad for mid/value-tier and more. Each segment has different variations to suit every consumer and business need. Other PC OEMs have similar offerings as well. At IFA, Qualcomm even introduced a new platform targeting laptops in the $700 range.\n\nMicrosoft offers many Copilot+ AI features and applications for better video calls, live captioning in many languages, text-to-image creation and more. AI is still in its infancy; as we progress, there will be a continuous flow of innovative and user experience-enhancing AI apps and features.\n\nOne key common factor among all Copilot+ PC platforms is that they have the same AI capability across tiers. For example, Qualcomm\u2019s XElite and XPlus have the same AI processor. This means no matter which Copilot+ PC you choose, you get excellent performance for years to come. In summary, if you are in the market for a laptop this year, go ahead and consider a Copilot+ PC."

In this ubiquitous environment, it\u2019s harder than ever to get a genuine sense of someone\u2019s vibe before deciding to follow them.\n\nEnter Shelf, an app that lets you create a personalized \u201cstorefront\u201d of your media habits, then connect with others based on the movies, shows, books, games, and music they consume. It also lets you track progress while reading your favorite book or watching a trending show.\n\n\u201cIf you observe culture at large on the internet, it\u2019s shifting away from posting selfies to here\u2019s what I\u2019m reading, watching, screenshots of the reviews of my movies and so on. It\u2019s essentially going deeper about a person, trying to understand what they\u2019re in \u2026 that\u2019s what Shelf is all about,\u201d said Jad Esber, co-founder and CEO of Koodos Labs, the startup behind Shelf, in an interview.\n\nEsber grew up writing online poetry anonymously, then spent the early years of his career at YouTube in London from 2015 to 2018. During this time, he worked on the creator side of the Google subsidiary, helping people create content, grow their audience, and monetize their work. This was when YouTube grew its creator ecosystem in various emerging markets outside the U.S.\n\nAfter spending over three years at Google, the Cambridge University master\u2019s graduate returned to academia, joining Harvard University to research consumer internet trends and study the internet academically. That eventually helped him conceptualize Shelf in a market full of social media apps with millions and billions of users.\n\n\u201cWe built many, many products,\u201d Esber told TechCrunch. \u201cThey all didn\u2019t work until Shelf, and Shelf emerged from those learnings.\u201d\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Shelf app, available on iOS and Android, lets you connect your accounts associated with media, including Apple Music, Goodreads, Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube, then builds a customizable \u201cstorefront\u201d web page that updates automatically based on your consumption progress. You can also manually add links to any other internet service to your virtual shelf \u2014 even links to your favorite TechCrunch articles, which you can showcase to your followers.\n\nThe New York-based startup also plans to expand the list of supported services, including Steam for gamers.\n\n\u201c[A]s humans and as people online, we\u2019re very multi-hyphenate. We\u2019re not just into music, movies, shows, and all these things. Adding support for certain categories will expand the user base, but at the same time deepens the use case for existing users,\u201d Esber said.\n\nYou can choose a URL for the digital shelf based on your preference. Likewise, the app lets you customize the interface by changing the background color and moving items depending on your taste.\n\nKoodos plans to monetize Shelf by offering new customization options. It could also explore monetizing insights that the app surfaces, Esber told TechCrunch.\n\nUnlike apps that call the data using APIs, Shelf works regardless of whether the platform has a first-party API. Generally, when users select a third-party service like Spotify or Apple Music from the Shelf UI, they\u2019re signed in (either via a redirect to that app, or via a pop-up screen). Once the user has signed in, Esber can pull all the information about that user\u2019s media consumption directly from the app.\n\nEsber also stated that the startup does not use the data Shelf gets from the services users list on the app to train AI, which has become a common practice among online platforms nowadays.\n\nThis data-sharing is powered by a technology called DataMovers, and Koodos has been working with other apps to expand this solution as well (although Esber wouldn\u2019t say which ones). He compares DataMover with the data transfer network for fintech Plaid.\n\n\u201cIn a similar way [to Plaid], we\u2019re affording that user provision access to data to other applications, too,\u201d he said.\n\nImage Credits: Koodos Labs\n\nPrivate experience in testing\n\nAlongside letting users create their storefronts for the public, Shelf has begun testing a private experience for some users, who only want to track their own media consumption without sharing it.\n\n\u201cWe intend to be a fun utility that anyone can use over time. Everyone has a bookshelf in their living room or at home. So, why can\u2019t everyone have the Shelf?\u201d Esber said.\n\nLaunched publicly this summer after its beta testing at the end of last year, Shelf has added half a billion items by its users. Esber declined to share user numbers but said the number of shelves on the app is growing by 40% month-to-month and that users visit Shelf an average of five times a week to check in on or update their digital shelves or keep up with others\u2019 shelves.\n\nKoodos has raised $7 million in total from investors, including First Round Capital, M13, Blockchain Capital, and IDEO, as well as the founders of companies, including Zynga and VSCO. It also counts Pinterest co-founder Evan Sharp, Dubsmash co-founder (now Reddit VP) Suchit Dash, and the pioneers of market design at Harvard, Professors John Deighton and Scott Kominers."

        "article_content": "When you think about artificial intelligence (AI), things such as self-driving cars and humanoid robots might come to mind. Counterintuitively, it's often a good idea to think about how products are actually brought to life whenever a new big trend emerges. Some of the most lucrative opportunities are also often the least obvious ones.\n\nFor AI to even work properly, companies have to invest large sums of capital expenditures (capex) into data centers. Although data centers might seem like just a piece of real estate, they are far more sophisticated and important. They house critical IT infrastructure, such as chipsets known as graphics processing units (GPUs) -- an important component of generative AI applications.\n\nToday, Nvidia is one of the biggest names in the data center realm. But what if I told you I see another opportunity as the superior choice among data center investments and that it's not even a technology company?\n\nIt's important to consider all options -- even the most tangential ones. Let's dig into a nuclear energy stock that I think may end up being the most important data center company in the long run and explore why this could be a lucrative opportunity for investors.\n\nNuclear-powered data centers are on the rise, and...\n\nA major selling point of AI is that the technology can bring a new wave of efficiency to a host of use cases. From breakthroughs in enterprise software to self-driving cars, AI is promising a new level of productivity and safety that's never been witnessed.\n\nAlthough that sounds great, as with all things, AI comes with some major trade-offs. Namely, building AI applications is a pricey ambition. GPU hardware and high-performance computing software are some of the more obvious expenses in AI development. One of the more subtle costs in an AI roadmap resides with data centers, particularly their energy consumption.\n\nGPUs are constantly running complex algorithms and performing sophisticated computing tasks. This makes IT architecture, such as server racks, consume a lot of energy and, in particular, give off a lot of heat. Data centers are equipped with a number of temperature control protocols, such as air conditioning units, fans, and generators.\n\nHowever, these solutions are both costly and can be inefficient compared to other sources of energy control. An emerging trend at the crossroads of data centers and energy consumption is nuclear power, and some really notable companies and business leaders are getting involved.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n...a lot of big names are involved\n\nOne notable company involved with nuclear-powered data centers is Amazon. One of the biggest businesses in Amazon's ecosystem is its cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Earlier this year, AWS acquired a nuclear-powered data center from Talen Energy for a reported $650 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother player emerging on the nuclear power scene is Oklo. Oklo develops nuclear fission reactors that it aims to sell to data centers and utility companies.\n\nWhen it was still a private company, Oklo raised funding from Peter Thiel and OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman. A few months ago, Oklo went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).\n\nAccording to its investor presentation, the company has received interest for its reactors from major companies, including Diamondback Energy, Equinix, Siemens Energy, and even the U.S. Air Force.\n\nWhile this caliber of attention and Altman's support are impressive, I see Oklo as a risky bet at the moment. The company is still pre-revenue, and the potential deals referenced above are in early-stage negotiations.\n\nOklo will likely require hefty ongoing research and development (R&D) costs to build out its reactors, which will take a toll on the company's liquidity so long as there aren't material sales coming through the door.\n\nMy top pick at the intersection of nuclear energy and data centers is...\n\nMy top choice among nuclear power suppliers for data centers is Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG). The company offers a host of energy services but is making sustainability and nuclear energy a specific focus.\n\nOne of the company's known nuclear power customers is \"Magnificent Seven\" member Microsoft. During the company's second-quarter earnings call in late August, CEO Joseph Dominguez referenced Comcast and Johns Hopkins as other notable customers of Constellation's carbon-free energy services.\n\nOther mega-cap tech companies will likely follow Amazon and Microsoft's moves. Constellation's diverse customer base signals that green energy is not just a use case for data centers or big tech hyperscalers.\n\nInvestors with a long-term horizon may want to consider a position in Constellation Energy right now. I think nuclear energy solutions will become more mainstream as the AI revolution continues to evolve. Given how early the AI narrative seems to be, I think an opportunity such as Constellation Energy is largely overlooked or underappreciated -- making it a tempting buy among other opportunities in AI, data centers, and energy consumption.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Constellation Energy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Constellation Energy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Constellation Energy wasn\u2019t one of them.

Dunfield told me that Fear Factory has a history of paranormal activity that has caused it to become the subject of frequent investigations.\n\nWorkers have reported strange incidents, including unexplained noises, flickering lights and ladders tipping over without warning.\n\nAs previously reported by the Deseret News, this combination of manufactured horror and reported paranormal occurrences has earned Fear Factory a reputation as one of the scariest haunted attractions in Utah \u2014 and the United States.\n\nFear Factory\u2019s expanding lore\n\nFear Factory has six buildings \u2014 some up to six stories high \u2014 and includes two underground passages, per its website. This provides a ton of space to expand their operations, adding to their ever growing catalog of spine-chilling attractions.\n\nLast year, the haunted house introduced a storyline centered around a mysterious, beating heart discovered in the deepest part of the factory.\n\n\u201cThe factory is alive and feeding off your fear,\u201d Dunfield explained. \u201cWhatever your fears are, maybe you will may see that in here.\u201d\n\nVisitors can expect encounters with a diverse range of phobias, such as bugs, spiders, the undead, clowns, heights, darkness and death.\n\nThis year, Dunfield hinted at new revelations about the factory\u2019s ominous power source.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll notice some big changes as you go up the tower,\u201d Dunfield teased. \u201cAt the top of the tower, be sure and look up. You\u2019ll see who\u2019s controlling the brain of the factory.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this frightful addition, Fear Factory will introduce a new 21-and-over bar, which Dunfield said is named \u201cDark Spirits at Fear Factory.\u201d\n\n1 of 10 Zoey Nilsson, of Draper, gets a scare from an actor as she and Noah Goeckeritz, of Alpine, walk through Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 2 of 10 Attendees exit Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 3 of 10 Jex Black, of Salt Lake City, poses in costume at Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 4 of 10 Jessica Reynoso, of Salt Lake City, poses in costume at Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 5 of 10 Kate Ward, of Highland, gets a scare from an actor in the wall as she and other attendees walk through Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 6 of 10 Attendees walk around the entrance area of Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 7 of 10 A portion of Fear Factory stands in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 8 of 10 Attendees walk through Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 9 of 10 Attendees walk through Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News 10 of 10 Kevin Williams, of West Valley City, poses in costume as \u201cGravedigger\u201d at Fear Factory in Salt Lake City on Friday, Sept. 20, 2024. | Isaac Hale, Deseret News\n\nHaunted houses offer a unique experience\n\nAfter speaking with Dunfield, I went through Fear Factory \u2014 my first time ever in a haunted house.\n\nWhile inexperienced, I felt prepared \u2014 I\u2019m no stranger to horror films. But as I quickly realized, a live haunted house is something else entirely.\n\nMy group wore glow sticks around our necks, letting actors know we were open to being touched, which attendees can opt into for a more immersive experience.\n\nEven though I knew the actors weren\u2019t real threats, the fact that they were actual people who could touch and interact with me added more horror than any scary movie can provide. Dunfield\u2019s earlier comments about the factory\u2019s paranormal activity only made it creepier.\n\nWhile the atmosphere was eerie, I attended on a busy day, which did make it less scary. The large crowd made the haunted house feel less personal.\n\nThat\u2019s the challenge of a top-tier haunted house attraction: It offers a thrilling, terrifying experience that draws larger crowds, which in turn can diminish the scary atmosphere.\n\nBut the overall experience was intense, with plenty of jump scares and disturbing visuals.\n\nThe experience was longer than I expected, lasting about 45 minutes, which was a definite plus with so much to see and explore. I\u2019m sure I missed a lot during my first visit, making it well worth a repeat trip.\n\nMemorable props included a lifelike, massive heart, a dummy being electrocuted in an electric chair and much more.\n\nOther standout parts included a section dedicated to clowns where we were given 3D glasses that enhanced the vibrant colors and a final pitch-black, smoke-filled room that led into a blinding light \u2014 a disorienting transition that felt like stepping into the afterlife.\n\nThe most terrifying moment for me, however, didn\u2019t include any props or actors. It was crossing a catwalk between two buildings with a grate floor, letting me to see how far up I was.\n\nFear Factory schedule and pricing\n\nAccording to their website, for the 2024 season Fear Factory operates on Fridays and Saturdays in September from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.\n\nIn October, it extends its hours, opening on weekdays from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and on Friday and Saturday from 7 p.m. to midnight.\n\nThe season ends with a blackout event on Nov. 1-2, during which all house lights are turned off, and guests explore the factory with only a small finger light.\n\nTickets range from $29.99 on weekdays to $36.99 on weekends. For an additional $4, visitors can experience the more immersive option of being touched by actors."

An El Ni\u00f1o is declared when sea temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific rise 0.5 \u00b0C above the long-term average.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd while volcanic activity definitely played a big role in the \u2018Great Dying\u2019 (the worst mass extinction in Earth\u2019s history, also known as the Permian-Triassic extinction), experts say the impact of these El Ni\u00f1os shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nChina University of Geosciences\u2019 Professor Yadong Sun claims that oxygen isotopes in fossils suggest they could have been greatly involved in this mass loss of life.\n\nHe said: \u201cMost life failed to adapt to these conditions, but thankfully a few things survived, without which we wouldn\u2019t be here today. It was nearly, but not quite, the end of life on Earth.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming had an impact (Getty Stock Image)\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd co-lead author of this study, Dr Alexander Farnsworth, from the University of Bristol, added: \u201cClimate warming alone cannot drive such devastating extinctions because, as we are seeing today, when the tropics become too hot, species migrate to the cooler, higher latitudes.\n\n\u201cOur research has revealed that increased greenhouse gases don\u2019t just make the majority of the planet warmer, they also increase weather and climate variability making it even more 'wild' and difficult for life to survive.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the exact cause of the Great Dying remains somewhat uncertain but it\u2019s pretty complicated.\n\nAs well as so much time having obviously passed since, there\u2019s a scarcity of fossils to study and a complexity of evidence. Either way, scientists know something big happened to have such a big consequence."

        "article_content": "In a first, scientists at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), have discovered interaction between a radio jet from a dwarf galaxy and interstellar gas causing shock waves.\n\nThe team found that the radio jet emitted from the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) -- a black hole -- from the centre of the galaxy NGC 4395. AGN is known to emit bright jets and winds and shape their galaxies.\n\nThe bright jet interacted with the surrounding interstellar medium at a small spatial scale of about or about 30 light years. The dwarf galaxy is situated at a distance of about 14 million light years.\n\nIn the study, published in a paper in the Astrophysical Journal, the team combined data from radio to X-ray wavebands from the galaxy NGC 4395 to find the interaction around the black hole.\n\n\"We decided to investigate how the radio jet from a small black hole interacts with the gas in a dwarf galaxy called NGC 4395,\" said lead author Payel Nandi, and doctoral student at IIA.\n\nThe team used data from the UltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board AstroSat -- India's first dedicated space observatory -- launched by ISRO in 2015, as well as Chandra for X-ray data Gemini-North and Hubble Space Telescope for optical data.\n\nThe findings showed a unique radio structure resembling a bipolar jet, whose core was centred at the black hole location.\n\n\"This jet is relatively weak, but our multi-wavelength analysis of this 30-light-year region showed that the jet is interacting with the surrounding gas, and possibly causing shock waves to propagate through it,\" said Prof. C. S. Stalin at IIA, a co-author of the study.\n\nThe light emitted by the ionised oxygen in the optical band, molecular hydrogen in the infrared region, and the X-ray emission, closely match the path of the radio jet.\n\nNandi noted that the study found \"strong evidence for an outflow of material carried by jet into the surrounding medium\".\n\n(With inputs from IANS)"

        "article_content": "A few years ago, a friend of mine was struggling to keep up with the growing demands of his small business. You see, every weekend, he\u2019d spend hours manually setting sports odds, taking calls from his dedicated clients, and recording options with a pen and paper. One particularly busy Sunday, after juggling a dozen calls at once and nearly missing a client\u2019s request, he realized he needed a better system. That\u2019s when he discovered pay per head software. Practically overnight, his operation transformed. With everything automated\u2014from odds management to online player accounts\u2014he was able to scale his business and compete with larger competitors, all while providing a seamless experience for his clientele. That shift marked the start of a new chapter, not just for him, but for sports agents everywhere, and it all came down to the power of technology.\n\nThe industry has undergone a technological revolution in recent years, with pay per head (PPH) software emerging as a powerful tool that is reshaping how smaller local agents operate. These platforms are empowering independent businesses by providing them with cutting-edge technology, which allows them to compete with larger, more established companies.\n\nWhat is Pay Per Head Software?\n\nAt its core, pay per head software is a service that enables sports agents to manage their operations digitally. Instead of handling phone requests, odds, and player figures manually, a PPH platform automates these processes. The agent pays a fee for each active customer\u2014hence the \u201cpay per head\u201d model. In return, they gain access to a fully functional, professional-grade software platform equipped with features like live in-game, prop builder and dynamic odds updates.\n\nThe scalability and affordability of PPH software have made it an attractive option for independent operators looking to modernize their business offering and provide their customers with a first rate user experience.\n\nThe Technology Behind the Software\n\nPPH software relies on several key technologies that make it both efficient and effective. Here are the critical components that make these platforms so transformative:\n\n1. Cloud Computing and Scalability\n\nOne of the major advantages of PPH software is that it is cloud-based, allowing for seamless scalability. Agents can handle a growing number of users without the need for significant upfront investment in infrastructure. Cloud servers automatically adjust to accommodate fluctuations in traffic, ensuring that the platform remains stable even during peak periods like major sporting events.\n\nThe cloud-based nature of PPH software also means that updates and maintenance can be done remotely, without requiring any downtime. This frees up the agent to run their operations smoothly with minimal technical issues.\n\n2. Real-Time Data Processing\n\nSpeed and accuracy are essential, and PPH software excels at both. These platforms use real-time data processing to provide up-to-the-second odds on various sporting events. This dynamic updating ensures that users are getting the most accurate information available, which is crucial to their experience.\n\nAdditionally, real-time data processing allows for the tracking of player activity instantly. This includes monitoring open positions, analyzing trends, and adjusting lines accordingly to manage risk. The ability to process vast amounts of data quickly is what provides the ability to stay competitive in a fast-paced environment.\n\n3. Automation and AI-Driven Analytics\n\nAutomation is at the heart of pay per head software. The platform automatically handles tasks such as managing player accounts, tracking wins and losses, and generating reports. This not only reduces the workload for agents but also minimizes the risk of human error.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, many advanced PPH systems are beginning to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to provide deeper insights into player behavior. AI-driven analytics can help to identify patterns, assess risk, and even predict future trends. By leveraging AI, agents can make more informed decisions, optimizing both profitability and player retention.\n\n4. Mobile Integration and User Experience\n\nToday\u2019s users demand mobile accessibility, and this software delivers. PPH platforms are designed with responsive, mobile-friendly interfaces that allow users to find sporting events, check odds, and manage their accounts from any device.\n\nThe user experience is central to the success of PPH. Many feature sleek, intuitive designs that make it easy for users to navigate and find options quickly. This focus on user experience not only enhances player satisfaction but also increases player retention, which is vital for agents looking to build a loyal customer base.\n\nThe Advantages for Sports Agents\n\nFor independent agents, pay per head software offers a host of benefits that are hard to ignore. Some of the most significant advantages include:\n\nCost Efficiency : With a simple pay per head fee structure, agents avoid the high costs of building and maintaining their own software infrastructure.\n\nFlexibility : PPH platforms offer a wide range of markets, from major sports like football and basketball to niche events like esports.\n\nRisk Management : Automated reporting and AI-driven analytics provide the tools needed to effectively manage risk and protect their bottom line.\n\nProfessionalism : Using a PPH platform elevates the sports agent\u2019s operation to a level that rivals established competitors, offering a professional experience to users.\n\nCustomizable Options : Pay per head platforms often allow agents to customize their offerings, tailoring the experience to their client\u2019s specific needs. Whether it\u2019s focusing on local sports, niche markets, or unique props, this flexibility enables an agent to stand out in a crowded marketplace and better cater to the preferences of their clientele.\n\n24/7 Customer Support : Many PPH services come with round-the-clock customer support for both the agent and their clients. This means that any technical issues or special inquiries can be resolved quickly, providing a seamless experience for users and reducing the operational burden on the agent.\n\nIncreased User Engagement : PPH platforms offer features like live in-game and real-time odds, which keep users more engaged and active. With exciting, up-to-the-minute options, agents can retain clients for longer periods, leading to increased activity and higher revenues over time.\n\nAs sports enthusiasm continues to grow globally, the demand for pay per head software is expected to increase. With advancements in AI, machine learning, and predictive analytics, PPH platforms will only become more sophisticated, giving sports agents deeper insights into user trends and behavior. Additionally, PPH services will continue to democratize the industry, allowing smaller operations to compete with larger companies on a level playing field."

        "article_content": "Data centers play an important role in artificial intelligence (AI) behind the scenes.\n\nWhen you think about artificial intelligence (AI), things such as self-driving cars and humanoid robots might come to mind. Counterintuitively, it's often a good idea to think about how products are actually brought to life whenever a new big trend emerges. Some of the most lucrative opportunities are also often the least obvious ones.\n\nFor AI to even work properly, companies have to invest large sums of capital expenditures (capex) into data centers. Although data centers might seem like just a piece of real estate, they are far more sophisticated and important. They house critical IT infrastructure, such as chipsets known as graphics processing units (GPUs) -- an important component of generative AI applications.\n\nToday, Nvidia is one of the biggest names in the data center realm. But what if I told you I see another opportunity as the superior choice among data center investments and that it's not even a technology company?\n\nIt's important to consider all options -- even the most tangential ones. Let's dig into a nuclear energy stock that I think may end up being the most important data center company in the long run and explore why this could be a lucrative opportunity for investors.\n\nNuclear-powered data centers are on the rise, and...\n\nA major selling point of AI is that the technology can bring a new wave of efficiency to a host of use cases. From breakthroughs in enterprise software to self-driving cars, AI is promising a new level of productivity and safety that's never been witnessed.\n\nAlthough that sounds great, as with all things, AI comes with some major trade-offs. Namely, building AI applications is a pricey ambition. GPU hardware and high-performance computing software are some of the more obvious expenses in AI development. One of the more subtle costs in an AI roadmap resides with data centers, particularly their energy consumption.\n\nGPUs are constantly running complex algorithms and performing sophisticated computing tasks. This makes IT architecture, such as server racks, consume a lot of energy and, in particular, give off a lot of heat. Data centers are equipped with a number of temperature control protocols, such as air conditioning units, fans, and generators.\n\nHowever, these solutions are both costly and can be inefficient compared to other sources of energy control. An emerging trend at the crossroads of data centers and energy consumption is nuclear power, and some really notable companies and business leaders are getting involved.\n\n...a lot of big names are involved\n\nOne notable company involved with nuclear-powered data centers is Amazon. One of the biggest businesses in Amazon's ecosystem is its cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Earlier this year, AWS acquired a nuclear-powered data center from Talen Energy for a reported $650 million.\n\nAnother player emerging on the nuclear power scene is Oklo. Oklo develops nuclear fission reactors that it aims to sell to data centers and utility companies.\n\nWhen it was still a private company, Oklo raised funding from Peter Thiel and OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman. A few months ago, Oklo went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).\n\nAccording to its investor presentation, the company has received interest for its reactors from major companies, including Diamondback Energy, Equinix, Siemens Energy, and even the U.S. Air Force.\n\nWhile this caliber of attention and Altman's support are impressive, I see Oklo as a risky bet at the moment. The company is still pre-revenue, and the potential deals referenced above are in early-stage negotiations.\n\nOklo will likely require hefty ongoing research and development (R&D) costs to build out its reactors, which will take a toll on the company's liquidity so long as there aren't material sales coming through the door.\n\nMy top pick at the intersection of nuclear energy and data centers is...\n\nMy top choice among nuclear power suppliers for data centers is Constellation Energy (CEG 22.29%). The company offers a host of energy services but is making sustainability and nuclear energy a specific focus.\n\nOne of the company's known nuclear power customers is \"Magnificent Seven\" member Microsoft. During the company's second-quarter earnings call in late August, CEO Joseph Dominguez referenced Comcast and Johns Hopkins as other notable customers of Constellation's carbon-free energy services.\n\nOther mega-cap tech companies will likely follow Amazon and Microsoft's moves. Constellation's diverse customer base signals that green energy is not just a use case for data centers or big tech hyperscalers.\n\nInvestors with a long-term horizon may want to consider a position in Constellation Energy right now. I think nuclear energy solutions will become more mainstream as the AI revolution continues to evolve. Given how early the AI narrative seems to be, I think an opportunity such as Constellation Energy is largely overlooked or underappreciated -- making it a tempting buy among other opportunities in AI, data centers, and energy consumption."
