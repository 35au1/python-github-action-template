In short Elon Musk suggests that UFO sightings could be the result of classified US government projects testing new aircraft or missiles, rather than evidence of extraterrestrial life.\n\nHe assures that if he ever discovers proof of alien life, he will immediately share it.\n\nMusk also speculates that if the government knew about aliens, they might portray them as threats to justify increased military spending. Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nMusk said he has not seen any evidence of aliens\n\nElon Musk believes UFO sightings are US government's secret weapons\n\nBy Mudit Dube 04:46 pm Oct 09, 202404:46 pm\n\nWhat's the story SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has weighed in on the recent spate of unidentified flying object (UFO) sightings in the United States. Speaking to political commentator and journalist Tucker Carlson, he argued that these UFOs aren't proof of extraterrestrial life but rather classified \"new weapons programs\" being tested by the US government. Even though he heads his own company, Space Exploration Technologies, Musk said he has \"not seen any evidence of aliens.\"\n\nAlien existence\n\nMusk questions existence of aliens amid numerous satellites\n\nMusk emphasized the fact that there are more than \"6,000 satellites\" in orbit around Earth, and none of them have ever had to dodge an alien spacecraft. He made the observation when Carlson asked him about the reports of US military regularly encountering unexplained objects. \"Well, unidentified flying objects are one thing, but there are always a bunch of classified programs that are underway,\" Musk said.\n\nClassified projects\n\nMusk suggests classified projects behind unexplained sightings\n\nMusk proposed the government could be testing \"new aircraft, new missiles, and things\" under highly classified programs. He said these tests could be so secretive that even high-ranking military officials may not be aware of them. This could explain why pilots report seeing fast-moving objects they can't identify, leading to increased UFO sightings.\n\nDisclosure promise\n\nMusk promises to disclose any evidence of extraterrestrial life\n\nMusk assured that if he ever finds evidence of alien life, he won't keep it a secret. He promised to share any such evidence immediately on the X platform, predicting it would probably be their most popular post ever. The promise is in line with his earlier statements where he hoped for friendly extraterrestrial beings and doubted government cover-ups about their existence.\n\nGovernment response\n\nMusk's views on government's potential response to alien existence\n\nPreviously, Musk had suggested that if the government knew about aliens, it would probably depict them as threats to justify more military spending. This perspective was shared in the context of a 2023 report that failed to confirm any recent alien sightings by service members as extraterrestrial life. The report prompted Congress to direct the Pentagon to examine its UFO files dating back to the end of World War II."

The theory basically talks about the possibilities of alien civilisations on exoplanets capable of colonising galaxies and yet, there is no evidence of it, thus it is a paradox.\n\nALSO SEE: ISRO Chief Shares Fascinating Theories On Aliens; Calls Elon Musk An 'Inspiration'"

        "article_content": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nDatabricks just made app development a piece of cake. The Ali Ghodsi-led company announced Databricks Apps, a capability that allows enterprise developers to quickly build production-ready data and AI applications in a matter of clicks.\n\nAvailable in public preview today, the service provides users with a template-based experience, where they can connect relevant data and frameworks of choice into a fully functional app that could run within their respective Databricks environment.\n\nAccording to the company, it can be used to create and deploy a secure app in as little as five minutes.\n\nThe announcement comes at a time when enterprises, despite being bullish on the potential of data-driven applications, continue to struggle with the operational hassle of the entire development cycle, right from provisioning the right infrastructure to ensuring security and access control of the developed app.\n\nWhat to expect from Databricks Apps?\n\nMuch like Snowflake, Databricks has long provided its customers the ability to build apps powered by their data hosted on the company\u2019s platform. Users can already build applications such as interactive dashboards to delve into specific insights or sophisticated AI-driven systems like chatbots or fraud detection programs.\n\nHowever, no matter what one chooses to develop, the process of bringing a reliable app to production in a secure and governed manner is not an easy one.\n\nThe developers have to go beyond writing the app to handle several critical aspects of the development pipeline, right from provisioning and managing infrastructure and ensuring data governance and compliance to manually bolting integrations for access controls and defining who could use the app and who could not. This often makes the whole development process complex and time-consuming.\n\n\u201cApp authors had to become familiar with container hosting technologies, implement single sign-on authentication, configure service principals and OAuth, and configure networking. The apps they created relied on integrations that were brittle and difficult to manage,\u201d Shanku Niyogi, the VP of product management at Databricks, tells VentureBeat.\n\nTo change this, the company is now bringing everything to one place with the new Databricks Apps experience.\n\nWith this offering, all a user has to do is select a Python framework from a set of options (Streamlit/Dash/Gradio/Flask), a template of the type of app they want to develop (chatbot or data visualization app) and configure a few basic settings, including those for mapping resources (like data warehouses or LLMs) and defining permissions.\n\nOnce the basic setup is done, the app is deployed to the user\u2019s Databricks environment, allowing them to use it themselves or share it with others in the team. When others log in, the app automatically prompts them with single sign-on authentication. Further, if needed, the developer will also get the option to customize the developed app and test their app code in their preferred IDE (integrated development environment).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/databricks/status/1843639454596247664\n\nOn the backend, Niyogi explained, the service provisions serverless compute to run the app, ensuring not only faster deployment but also that the data does not leave the Databricks environment.\n\n\u201cEach app is fortified with robust security measures for seamless and secure user access. Plus, the integration with Unity Catalog provides comprehensive data governance and management capabilities, while the apps inherit the networking protections of your workspace, ensuring a multi-layered security approach for your sensitive data and applications,\u201d he explained.\n\nAt this stage, Databricks Apps only supports Python frameworks. However, Niyogi noted that the company is working to expand to more tools, languages and frameworks, making secure app creation easier for everyone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started with Python, the #1 language for data. Anyone familiar with a Python framework can write their app in code, and anyone with an existing app can onboard it into Databricks Apps easily. We support any Python IDE. We are working with ISV partners to enable their tools to support Databricks Apps, and add support for other languages and frameworks,\u201d he added.\n\nSome 50 enterprises have already tested Databricks Apps in beta, including Addi, E.ON Digital Technology, SAE International, Plotly and Posit. With the public preview launching today, the number is expected to grow in the coming months.\n\nNotably, Snowflake, Databricks\u2019 biggest competitor, also has a low-code way to help enterprises develop and deploy data and AI apps.\n\nHowever, Databricks claims to distinguish itself with a more flexible and interoperable approach.\n\n\u201cDatabricks Apps supports Dash, Gradio, Flask, and Shiny as well as Streamlit, and supports more versions of Streamlit than Snowflake does. Developers can also use their choice of tools to build apps. We will continue to build on this flexible approach, adding support for more languages, frameworks and tools,\u201d Niyogi pointed out."

However, that announcement didn\u2019t make clear whether Rogers and WBD would move forwards as partners on the latter\u2019s lifestyle channel, though a rep indicated there would be no change.\n\nBell has been the Canadian home of WBD and predecessor Discovery\u2019s suite for three decades, operating many of its channels locally. However, in June, Rogers struck a deal to move WBD\u2019s lifestyle and factual channels into its sphere. Bell responded by filing for an injunction at the Ontario Superior Court to stop Rogers distributing the networks, claiming that WBD was blocked from moving its shows.\n\nRogers said today that Bell \u201cacknowledged all claims against Rogers were unfounded and abandoned its legal efforts.\u201d\n\nThe upshot is Rogers will launch Discovery ID and Discovery Channel as linear networks and distribute them to third-parties such as Bell. Content from Cooking, OWN, MotorTrend, Animal Planet and Discovery Science will be available on-demand and via Citytv+ on Amazon Prime Video Channels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already home to Canada\u2019s number one sports network, and this partnership helps solidify our leadership in entertainment with a diverse media portfolio of TV\u2019s most iconic brands,\u201d said Colette Watson, President, Rogers Sports & Media.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

This operation carried out with the French Tech Seed funds, managed on behalf of the State by Bpifrance as part of France 2030, IRDI Investment Capital, Xplore By \u00c9pop\u00e9e Gestion and EuroBIM, will allow the company to accelerate the development of its offer, to strengthen its presence in France and internationally and to recruit new talents.\n\nA unique innovation in the world to meet the energy efficiency needs of electronic chips\n\nGeneral-purpose processors are omnipresent on the market. Offering great versatility, they equip all types of electronic devices, from IoT to the automotive world. Capable of handling a multitude of tasks, these \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d products are the default solution for manufacturers in a hurry to position themselves on the market. However, this general approach presents significant limits in terms of cost, energy efficiency and performance: 50% of the functionalities will never be used during the life of the processor. Well aware of these obstacles, more and more players wish to turn to personalized chips, but are faced with excessively slow and costly development cycles.\n\nA true catalyst for innovation, Keysom responds to this challenge and allows manufacturers to design a tailor-made processor in the space of a few simple and rapid iterations, without any constraints linked to inherent technical development. To this end, with a highly qualified technical team, Keysom devoted 4 years of R&D to develop Keysom Studio, its intelligent and easy-to-use tool capable of exploring, testing, modifying and optimizing a very wide variety of complex architectures in order to arrive at a unique solution each time, entirely adapted to the customer\u2019s needs \u2013 without the need for advanced technical skills or a team of experts.\n\nKeysom thus opens a new era for manufacturers, putting within their reach the design of more efficient, more economical and more ecological tailor-made processors, on both a small and large scale. The launch of this solution marks a turning point for all companies seeking agility and competitiveness.\n\n\u201cWhere manufacturers pay for oversized generic processors, which generate costs and energy waste, a custom processor uses less raw material (in this case silicon), leading to lower production costs and simplified manufacturing processes. In a context where demand for semiconductors continues to increase, reducing the silicon area per chip is a major strategic advantage. Our software allows to explore up to 12 million processor combinations to achieve this.\u201d confides Luca Testa \u2013 Co-founder & Director of Operations of Keysom\n\nRaising \u20ac4M to accelerate sales on an international scale\n\nSupported by the French Tech Seed funds, managed on behalf of the State by Bpifrance as part of France 2030, IRDI Investment Capital, Xplore by \u00c9pop\u00e9e Gestion and EuroBIM, Keysom has just completed a \u20ac4M fundraising. This funding round marks a decisive step for Keysom, thus anchoring its position as a technological pioneer in the field of custom processor design.\n\n\u201cThis fundraising is an important milestone in our growth strategy. It gives us the means to further accelerate the development of our technology and lead our commercial expansion into new markets. We firmly believe that our no code tool will redefine the way manufacturers approach the design and optimization of their systems. \u00bb adds Cyril Sagonero \u2013 President of Keysom\n\nPart of the funds will be dedicated to the recruitment of new R&D technical experts, in order to continue to innovate and improve the performance of hardware and software solutions, as well as to the recruitment of qualified commercial profiles. With the support of its investors, Keysom aspires to continue offering solutions that transform the industry while keeping in mind the democratization of the access to high-tech tools for as many people as possible.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the State, Bpifrance actively participates in the reindustrialization of France and works for the sovereignty of the country by supporting companies in strategic sectors. We are happy to be alongside the deeptech company Keysom, whose talented teams and custom processor design technology promise a real revolution in industrial electronics. \u00bb adds Fran\u00e7ois Charbonnier, Investment Director at Bpifrance.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to support the Keysom team in this kick-off sales phase because we are convinced that Keysom makes it possible to provide an innovative, sovereign solution with a limited carbon impact to industrial players, many of whom need processors. \u00bb Camille Le Roux Larsabal, VC Associate at Epop\u00e9e Gestion.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the elements already cited by my colleagues \u2013 disruptive innovation, technical excellence and environmental impact \u2013 I would add that Keysom is a company with strong local roots, in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region. We are convinced that the managers have all the qualities to make this startup an important player both locally and internationally. \u00bb Vincent Brousse, Investment Director at IRDI Investment Capital.\n\nAbout Keysom\n\nIn 2019, Cyril Sagonero and Luca Testa are beginning to question the market approach of buying off-the-shelf processors in order to reduce time to market. The waste of area and energy consumption is huge. At the same time, version 2.2 of the RISC-V ISA is frozen, opening the door to this new ISA to the industry. The following year, discussions with PhD J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Crenne of the University of Bordeaux and software architecture expert Fabrice Bonnet laid the foundations for Keysom, a French startup which aims to enable semiconductor companies to automatically and simply obtain the RISC-V processor best suited to their needs. In 2022 Keysom is developing the world\u2019s first coding-free tool dedicated to the design of custom processors.\n\nAbout Bpifrance and the French Tech Seed fund:\n\nBpifrance finances companies \u2013 at each stage of their development \u2013 \u200b\u200bwith credit, guarantees and equity. Bpifrance supports them in their innovation projects and internationally. Bpifrance also ensures their export activity through a wide range of products. Consulting, university, networking and acceleration program for start-ups, SMEs and mid-sized companies are also part of the offer presented to entrepreneurs.\n\nThanks to Bpifrance and its 50 regional locations, entrepreneurs benefit from a close, unique and efficient contact to help them face their challenges.\n\nEndowed with 500 million euros, the French Tech Seed Fund aims to support fundraising by innovative start-ups and VSEs less than 3 years old carrying out technologically intensive innovation. Resulting from the Future Investment Program (PIA), now integrated into France 2030 and operated on behalf of the State by Bpifrance, the fund is based on certified business providers, responsible for identifying and qualifying these young companies and put them in touch with private investors. These business providers, ensuring the technological validity of the project, will allow public investment, in the form of Convertible Bonds of up to 400 million euros, in addition to the capital provided by private investors. 100 million euros are also dedicated to equity investments in addition to the conversion of Convertible Bonds.\n\nMore info on: www.Bpifrance.fr \u2013 https://presse.bpifrance.fr / \u2013 Follow-us on X (formerly Twitter): @Bpifrance \u2013 @BpifrancePresse\n\nAbout IRDI Investment Capital\n\nIRDI Investment Capital has been one of the leaders in regional investment capital for 40 years. Working in New Aquitaine and Occitanie, we support companies at all stages of their development (Startup, Venture Capital, Development Capital / Transmission). Since its creation, IRDI Investment Capital has financed more than 1,000 local companies and today manages assets of more than 550 million euros through funds dedicated to each practice.

First Name Last Name Your Email Address (Required)\n\nAs broadcast technology evolves, the debate over software versus hardware-based tools intensifies. This is especially clear in the world of production switchers, where smaller productions and secondary locations are perfect for a move to the cloud.\n\nProduction switchers, essential for live video mixing and effects, are at the forefront of this technological shift. Traditional hardware switchers, long the workhorses of broadcast control rooms, now face competition from software-based alternatives that promise greater flexibility and scalability.\n\nIP-based workflows and remote production have accelerated this trend, making software switchers increasingly attractive for certain applications. However, hardware solutions continue to offer reliability and low latency advantages, particularly for large-scale, high-stakes live productions.\n\nFlexibility and upgradeability\n\nSoftware-based switchers offer significant advantages in flexibility and adaptability to new technologies.\n\n\u201cBecause technology is rapidly changing, the essential difference is that hardware solutions lock you in with the capabilities of today, while software-based solutions provide you with much easier deployment when new advancements are made,\u201d said Ryan Hansberger, head of product development for video mixing at Vizrt.\n\nThis flexibility extends to remote productions, with Hansberger noting that software solutions enable productions to \u201chappen essentially anywhere, while maintaining reliability and performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the software-based switchers, extension of functionalities is possible at any time without changing specific hardware and is always therefore future-proof,\u201d said Greg Huttie, VP of production switchers at Grass Valley, on upgradeability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerformance and reliability\n\nWhile software solutions offer flexibility, hardware switchers maintain advantages in certain performance metrics.\n\n\u201cWhile these software-based offerings can complement a hardware-based production switcher for producing alternative feeds or sub-shows, they still lack the horsepower of today\u2019s purpose-built production switchers,\u201d said Deon LeCointe, director of networked solutions at Sony Electronics.\n\n\u201cA hardware switcher\u2019s latency for processing and operation is minimal, and there are no potential network security issues,\u201d said Satoshi Kanemura, president of For-A.\n\nHowever, Huttie suggests that the gap between software and hardware performance is narrowing.\n\n\u201cBoth software-based and hardware-based production switchers can be optimized for reliability and performance across various applications. Key features such as redundant IP networks, handling multiple formats, and power supplies can enhance the reliability and performance of both types of switchers,\u201d said Huttie.\n\nRemote production capabilities\n\nThe ability to support remote production workflows has become increasingly important. Software-based switchers often have an edge in this area.\n\n\u201cSoftware-based solutions also provide greater flexibility for remote productions, enabling them to happen essentially anywhere, while maintaining reliability and performance,\u201d said Hansberger.\n\n\u201cThe advent of advanced Media over IP technologies including SMPTE ST 2110, SRT, and NDI have ushered in a new age of connectivity for production switchers which has enabled new remote workflows,\u201d said LeCointe.\n\n\u201cOperation of an on-prem switcher can happen remotely as well, if the switcher supports streaming of its multi-viewer outputs and can connect control panels to the switcher via the internet,\u201d said Keith Vidger, principal technical consultant at Panasonic Connect.\n\nFuture-proofing strategies\n\nManufacturers are implementing various strategies to ensure their products remain relevant as technology advances. For hardware switchers, this often involves modular designs.\n\n\u201cThe overall modular structure of the hardware-based K-Frame\u2019s I/O and processing boards affords either introduction of new boards or adding functionality (some examples: introducing onboard JPEG XS signals processing, color mapping of HDR and SDR, and adding additional clean-feeds),\u201d said Huttie on Grass Valley\u2019s approach.\n\nSoftware-based solutions, by nature, offer more straightforward upgrade paths.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re implementing software-based architecture that easily supports any future requirements, all formats, and all compression standards,\u201d noted Kanemura.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shift towards cloud-based production environments is also influencing switcher development.\n\n\u201cWe have already seen the introduction of software-based production switcher platforms, like Sony\u2019s M2L-X, which can be deployed on premises in COTS hardware and on the Cloud,\u201d said LeCointe on Sony\u2019s approach.\n\nHuttie notes that for Grass Valley\u2019s software-based switchers, \u201cThe location of the processing does not limit the functionality or performance of the production switcher and can therefore be freely selected as required.\u201d\n\nChoosing between software and hardware\n\nThe choice between software and hardware switchers depends on specific production needs.\n\n\u201cThe choice between software and hardware solutions often depends on specific production needs rather than inherent limitations in reliability or performance,\u201d said Huttie.\n\nFactors to consider include the scale of production, required features, budget and the importance of remote operation capabilities.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, the lines between software and hardware switchers may blur further.\n\n\u201cIt is just a matter of time until we see software-based solutions that provide the same specs as their hardware-based predecessors,\u201d said LeCointe.\n\nFor broadcasters, the decision between software and hardware switchers involves carefully weighing flexibility, performance and future scalability against current production requirements."
