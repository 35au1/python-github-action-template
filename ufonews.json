He favours a black and white Flying V and helped popularise cocked-wah guitar tone. His new album is an all-star celebration of his UFO days, featuring Slash, Axl Rose and other heavy friends.\n\nWhat guitar did you learn on?\n\n\u201cIt was a guitar that was lying around. It must have been an acoustic. My brother Rudolf [Scorpions guitarist] got a Gibson for his birthday instead of a motorbike. It must have been that one that I secretly played against his will!\n\n\u201cThe first song I played was something to do with San Francisco. It was a hit in those days. [Hums San Francisco by The Mamas And The Papas] Yeah! And there was a solo in there, and I learnt that. I was nine years old and I was very happy.\u201d\n\nWas was there a moment when you felt you had arrived as a player?\n\n\u201cNo, it has always been the same for me. Right from the moment when I was nine years old and picked up a guitar, I was always amazed with what I could discover, and it never stopped. I am in the same place!\n\nHow much did you practise in those early days and how often do you practise now?\n\n\u201cIt is more like play and discover. That\u2019s different. It is less technical. It is more like looking for gold, and once in a while I find a piece of gold. This will automatically become part of my developed style.\u201d\n\nWhat you do with the guitar expresses your personality\n\nWhat is the one song or performance that you\u2019re most proud of?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with everything. For me, it is never about a song. I am a lead guitarist! Ha! Lead guitarists think differently. My whole life has always been about development, so every moment is special, and every moment is different. We can never compare any of them.\"\n\nWhat was your biggest motivation as a player?\n\n\u201cI wanted to express myself. That was my devotion. It still is and I have done it for 50 years, without listening to music so I don\u2019t get influenced, and that\u2019s where the uniqueness comes from. Focus on opening up what\u2019s unique about yourself. Anybody who makes that decision can do it. I am a musical monk or something. That\u2019s my mission. Self-expression is my mission.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want, in every sense, not just music. I just love to self-express and really do what I like to do. I am just in a place where I choose to do it this way instead of copying anyone else. What you do with the guitar expresses your personality.\u201d\n\nWhat technique did you have to work hardest to master?\n\n\u201cThere is no technique for me. Technique is very, very much in the background. The important thing was to find the note. I felt like I knew it was there, somewhere, and I have to find it! And the last thing on my mind was if I do it the right way or the wrong way, as long as I found that note.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, that\u2019s what I did. Day after day after day, I basically developed \u2013 technically \u2013 the wrong way of playing compared to today where you have the guitar schools, where you learn the perfect position of the hand, how to hold your fingers and play with all five fingers. But I couldn\u2019t have found my notes. I couldn\u2019t have written the songs I wrote if I would have followed that first. I just didn\u2019t care if I did it the right or wrong way.\u201d\n\nAs a player, do you have any bad habits?\n\nThere are no bad habits! There is only one thing: to make good music however you do it.\n\n\u201cThere are no bad habits! There is only one thing: to make good music however you do it. Hey, there is no right or wrong for me. I can get better technically because I have plenty of time to get my fingers into easier positions, but the thing is, there are certain ways of playing, like my style, that you cannot necessarily get across if I play it perfectly positioned with my fingers based on what\u2019s taught at guitar schools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like fishing. How you find the note, how you strike or sweep over the strings, how you hit them, that is how the sound comes together. It\u2019s not technical. Technicality makes everything clinical.\n\n\u201cBut fishing for notes as a priority makes everything three dimensional, analogue. It gives it warmth. It\u2019s not perfect \u2013 it\u2019s feeling. It\u2019s more feeling than having the right position of your fingers playing guitar.\u201d\n\nMichael Schenker wears a black felt hat and lets out a scream as he plays his black and white Dean V onstage in London.\n\nIn your early days, what guitar was the game changer for you?\n\n\u201cA triangle guitar! Yeah, very strange. I had never seen a Flying V, but when I was at school, doing this project, building something out of wood, I wanted to make a guitar and ended up building a triangle guitar, which is similar to a Flying V, but it\u2019s not the Flying V.\n\n\u201cYou put a Flying V next to a Les Paul, next to a Strat, on the floor, it won\u2019t do anything. It becomes something with the person who picks up the guitar. That\u2019s what that guitar becomes. I found the Flying V by coincidence. Like many things in my life, it happened by itself. So maybe I was meant to have that guitar.\n\n\u201cI discovered that guitar by accident. I liked the combination of my amplifier with that guitar. It was closer to the sound I imagined, and I found that I was able to do a really good vibrato by putting the V between my legs, so that the neck would not wobble around. I was able to lock it in and so that was one of the main reasons why I felt good about that guitar.\u201d\n\nWith your new album of classic UFO material, was there anything you learned about your playing when revisiting songs you wrote 50 years ago?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t analyse things. I just do it. I don\u2019t analyse what I have done, or why I did it, I just do it because that is the moment of being an artist. You just do it. Less thought!\u201d\n\nWhat do you play when you\u2019re just relaxing and playing for fun?\n\n\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t think. I just pick up the guitar and play. But one thing I do in order to keep shape is I play to a metronome to make sure I am not slowing down in any way, because when you get older the way we perceive time is different from when we are younger, so sometimes you think you are playing as fast as you did the day before but it is do with the biological rhythm. I always measure by a metronome, at a certain speed. I have to make sure that I can play my old songs.\u201d\n\nDo you have any favourite tracks from revisiting your UFO years?\n\n\u201cI love This Kid\u2019s with Biff [Byford, Saxon frontman]. I was amazed. I always wanted to do something with Biff. Every song is different but everybody did a great version. I don\u2019t like comparing things. I just like to listen to it and not compare it like the Olympics! There are so many different qualities, different feelings, but all of them are unique in their own way, so I don\u2019t give them points for their performances.\n\nOne thing I do in order to keep shape is I play to a metronome to make sure I am not slowing down in any way, because when you get older the way we perceive time is different from when we are younger\n\n\u201cIt is all great stuff, what they did. When I heard Dee Snider [ex-Twisted Sister singer] I went, \u2018Wow!\u2019 I didn\u2019t know he had a great voice like this. Kai Hansen [Helloween guitarist/vocalist] was another one. He did a fantastic job on Rock Bottom. And when I heard Joel Hoekstra, he sounds like a saxophone on his guitar. He\u2019s really, really unique. It was fun. It still is fun listening to the different approaches. I didn\u2019t expect anything, but when I heard it I was extremely happy with it.\u201d\n\nAnd Axl Rose?\n\n\u201cAxl originally sang three songs, but he didn\u2019t like his versions of Only You Can Rock Me and Too Hot To Handle, so he decided to stick with Love To Love, which is a fantastic version.\n\nCan you recall a moment when you felt like you\u2019d failed as a player or felt embarrassed by a performance?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big question. Of course you can feel embarrassed when you play a bum note. But I don\u2019t really focus on that. I\u2019d rather focus on the good moments. You know, I played bum notes on Strangers In The Night [UFO\u2019s legendary 1979 live album], and today those bum notes are the right notes! Because everybody got used to it.\n\n\u201cAnd people ask me, \u2018Michael, how do you make this work, playing a major over a minor?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u2019 But they might have been asking about those bum notes!\u201d\n\nMy Years With UFO is out now via EarMUSIC."

For the day that aliens reveal themselves may very well become the beginning of the end of life on Earth as we know it!\u201d\n\nA flying saucer crashes deep in the mountains of Japan. Wary of the hyper-intelligent beings they find inside, the government hides from the public all news of the alien craft. But it's not the strange visitors themselves that they should be afraid of\u2015the real danger is the parasitic spores smuggled aboard! Will Earth survive the UFO MUSHROOM INVASION ?!\n\nOriginally published in 1976, Shirakawa Marina's UFO MUSHROOM INVASION is a masterpiece of sci-fi horror. Drawing on his deep knowledge of Japanese folklore and the supernatural, Shirakawa created one of manga history's cult classics and an unforgettably creepy entry in the canon of spore-horror. With an essay by weirdologist Udagawa Takeo, UFO MUSHROOM INVASION is the second volume of SMUDGE, a line of vintage horror, occult, and dark fantasy manga, curated and translated by award-winning historian Ryan Holmberg .\n\nUFO Mushroom Invasion has a story and art by Marina Shirakawa , with English translation by Ryan Holmberg . This volume was lettered by Ozzy van Eschen and Sean Michael Robinson . Published by Living the Line (September 17, 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs It Worth Reading?\n\n2024 \u00a9 estate of Shirakawa Marina\n\nDo mushrooms make you uncomfortable? Is there something unpleasant about their odd shapes and strange, spongy texture? If the answer is yes, UFO Mushroom Invasion is the manga of your nightmares, because its plot involves alien fungi being brought to Earth in a flying saucer crash and taking over the world. People are colonized by the mushrooms, becoming human versions of insects infected by zombie fungus, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Even if mushrooms aren't the stuff of your nightmares, this is a genuinely unsettling book.\n\nIt's also an interestingly written one. The late Marina Shirakawa , who created manga during the 1970s and 80s, has a style that feels like a combination of Junji Ito , Kazuo Umezz, and Shigeru Mizuki , with creepy, stylized art and a penchant for breaking into folkloric tangents. The book combines traditional manga and illustrated story pages, with the latter covering the history of UFO sightings (primarily in Japan and the U.S.) and \u201cbizarre mushroom tales,\u201d which are retellings of various Japanese stories where mushrooms are the antagonists. It's odd but it does ultimately work, and I found myself enjoying the style mixing much more than anticipated \u2013 it creates an intimacy between author and reader that works to make the manga segments hit harder.\n\nThe science fiction/horror blend is in the classic vein of stories that predict that humans will become the authors of their own downfall. In this case, Professor White's greed to keep the information about an alien to himself allows the spores to spread; had he not silenced Aoki and Sado-sensei early on, the entire tragedy may have been at least partially preventable. But Shirakawa also leaves us room to wonder if maybe the mushrooms reclaiming the earth for nature isn't the best ending, anyway \u2013 it's an environmental message that makes a little bit of sense and one that you've probably seen before in the genre.\n\nAlongside the well-translated story, this also has an essay about Shirakawa's place in the mangaverse as well as a retrospective of some of his works, both of which are interesting and very readable. Fans of 1970s manga (this was published in 1976, set in 1978, which allowed his original readers to wonder if it could happen in two years) or horror shouldn't pass this by.\n\n2024 \u00a9 estate of Shirakawa Marina\n\nUFO Mushroom Invasion does exactly what it says on the tin. Mushrooms from a UFO invade. This isn't as daft as it sounds, and despite its age (it was originally published in 1976) and very dated art style, UFO Mushroom Invasion is genuinely unsettling and creepy. Author Marina Shirakawa intersperses his chapters with relevant factual titbits about biology and folklore that helps to build a sense of looming dread, of inescapable catastrophe.\n\nAoki and his teacher are mere ciphers, headstrong student and stoic teacher. We learn almost nothing about them, their function is to be generic everyman witnesses to extraordinary events. I can't help but compare the opening chapters to the cheesy 1950's movie version of The War of the Worlds , though we soon enter far darker, weirder territory.\n\nAnyone familiar with videogame/TV franchise The Last of Us will know how this goes \u2013 there's even a reference here to a Cordyceps-like fungus that controls its hosts, and the later appearance of fungal-infected zombie people, complete with mushrooms growing from their bodies.\n\nWhat's different about UFO Mushroom Invasion compared to its later equivalents is in its nilhilsm. Even The Last of Us contains a seed of hope for humanity, not so here. In one particularly powerful scene, Aoki is told by a mushroom-infected adult to give in to the fungal invaders, to surrender his body to the soil of the warm Earth. This is a dark fable, an early musing on the Dark Forest hypothesis recently popularised by Cixin Liu's Three Body Problem . If aliens really are out there, we don't want them to know about us, because the moment they do, all life on Earth will change (end)."

        "article_content": "Honor's Magic 7 series, which launches in China on Oct. 30, wants to handle your morning coffee order, tailored exactly to your taste, right down to the type of milk you prefer.\n\nThe Chinese company released a demo video to the media on Tuesday showing a text-based interaction between a person and the device's AI assistant, Yoyo. The user requests the assistant to order him a pick-me-up beverage saying, \"Please help me order a drink. I am feeling a little sleepy.\" The AI assistant then goes on to launch the Meituan app, a popular food deliver app in China, selecting the Raw Milk Latte drink at a local coffee shop and takeout before placing the order.\n\nIn the video, some of the drink's preferences, such as not adding sugar and making it iced, seem to have been preselected rather than inputted on the spot. Presumably, the assistant was repeating the person's most frequent order. Honor said the idea is for the phone to learn a person's habits over time, which will allow the Magic 7 to learn which app to use for takeout as well as whether a user prefers coconut milk with their coffee over dairy milk, for instance.\n\nIn recent years, smartphone-makers have been leaning on generative AI to lure buyers. A recent Motorola AI concept describes a similar feature to what Honor is describing, which would also order a coffee on command from the nearest shop. Every major phone-maker from Google to Samsung and more recently Apple has been promoting new AI features in a bid to drive sales. AI isn't necessarily a contributing factor, but phone sales have been climbing this year. According to research firm Canalys, global smartphone shipments grew by 12% in the second quarter of this year, reaching 288 million units, with Samsung taking the top spot followed closely by Apple.\n\nHonor's Yoyo Assistant placing a coffee order. Honor\n\nHonor also mentioned other assistant-like capabilities that it expects to make its way to the Magic 7. Those include the AI assistant finding and canceling unwanted subscriptions across different apps with just a command, which it previewed with a second demo video.\n\nIn the video, a person asks the Yoyo assistant to check which apps have auto-renewal subscriptions activated. In a matter of seconds, the assistant pulls up a series of apps that are due for renewal and then asks the user whether to cancel all those subscriptions.\n\n\"OK, Yoyo has taken over your phone,\" the assistant said before going on to cancel a subscription.\n\nApart from that, Honor said that the AI agent can help across a broad range of tasks including booking an airplane ticket, notification management and calendar scheduling, among others. These features are set to launch on an upcoming operating system, MagicOS 9.0, before the end of the month. The Magic 7 will run on Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, the company revealed on Monday at a Qualcomm conference.\n\nHonor unveils its Magic 7 flagship series at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summnit conference in Hawaii on Monday. Honor\n\nHonor's vision for its phone AI seems more action-oriented compared to its competitors -- much like the plan Motorola laid out earlier in October, wherein it shared its ambitions of turning their phones into a true assistant. Motorola's vision also included the ability to order coffee using your phone with a simple command, among other tasks.\n\nLast year, Honor teased an AI-powered eye-tracking feature around this time that eventually made its way to the Magic 6 series. Honor gave the Magic 6 Pro, the higher-end predecessor, a global launch at the Mobile World Congress technology conference in February this year. Honor is expected to give the Magic 7 lineup an international launch as well, but currently hasn't confirmed those plans."

        "article_content": "The Fenton History Center is helping community members get into the Halloween spirit with two Halloween Spirit Tours set for Oct 26.\n\nThe tours are presented and run by Kaycee Colburn, a Fenton board member, artist, paranormal investigator and spiritual intuitive. Colburn comes from a background of working with the paranormal community, including at places such as the Dunkirk Lighthouse, other similar museums to the Fenton, and recreational locations such as the Haunted Hinsdale House.\n\nThe first tour will take place from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Fenton, 67 Washington Street. The cost for the first tour is $30 for members and $35 for non-members. The second tour is a special Halloween tour from 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. for adults 18 and up. The cost for the second tour is $40 for members and $45 for non-members. Additionally, guests are encouraged to come in costume for the second tour, which Colburn said helps to bring people into a different mindset.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring the paranormal vibe to the area, see if we can trigger any spirits and enhance the experience for the guests,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cWe don\u2019t say the Fenton is haunted, we leave that up to the guests and hope to give them a fun experience.\u201d\n\nColburn said the paranormal is something that is very popular these days and the tour can help give people insights into what they might see on television, along with allowing them to choose for themselves if the paranormal is or is not for them. She added that the tour is good for this time of year when the paranormal is already popular and people are looking for Halloween related things to do.\n\n\u201cPeople are already interested in the Fenton on its own and now they can come in the dark and see it in a different light, which gives a cool Halloween feeling,\u201d Colburn said.\n\nColburn encouraged participants to bring a flashlight, dress warmly, and be open minded, saying that there are a lot of theories surrounding the paranormal and that it is not for everyone. She said the tours are for people to come have fun and are very educational about the paranormal.\n\nThe Fenton has done other Spirit Tours throughout the year, and Colburn thought it was something that could possibly be done again next year after having received good responses this year to previous tours. She said some participants have requested the tours be longer or be overnight, which is something she said they are not currently able to do, but that overall there has been a positive response.\n\n\u201cIt gets people out of the house,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else quite like it locally.\u201d\n\nThe Spirit Tours are set to offer a safe Halloween, family friendly, fun event to let people learn more about the paranormal and spiritualist movement. Colburn said the tours are a way to bring information in and discuss the paranormal where in today\u2019s society that cannot always happen as it is labeled as creepy.\n\n\u201cThere was a time where the paranormal was not seen as creepy, including right here in Jamestown,\u201d Colburn said. \u201cSo being able to talk about it this way is cool.\u201d\n\nRegistration for both Oct 26 Spirit Tours is available on the Fenton History Center\u2019s website, fentonhistorycenter.org, under the events tab."

        "article_content": "This spooky season, which brings with it Fear the Spotlight\u2019s release as the first in a very cool slate out of Blumhouse, feels like quite a culmination of a tremendous year for horror video games. After sampling the game\u2019s horrific opening chapter back at Summer Game Fest, I was left wanting more. Fear the Spotlight really does feel like a tribute to so many of the classic games that paved the way for it, from its lo-fi, dithering graphics that leave enough doubt in your mind to jump at shadows, to its tactile, hands-on puzzle solving.\n\nFear the Spotlight, which is an expanded upon iteration of its release only a year ago, begins on a stormy night as Vivian, the player-character, and Amy break into Sunnyside High to perform a seance in the school\u2019s library. Quite predictably, things go haywire as the supernatural descends upon their night, leading to far more trouble than a simple breaking and entering should. Amy is found in a fugue state before she\u2019s drawn in by a powerful light, forcing Vivian to descend deeper into the belly of the school, which has cracked upon a portal to its past which, it seems, has plenty of skeletons in its closet to unearth after a fire decimated the campus in 1991.\n\nAlthough they spend relatively no screen time together, it is the burgeoning relationship of the two schoolgirl leads that drives events forward. While I won\u2019t divulge where the game goes, having seen where the original release rolled credits, I do think the direction of the expanded content is a genius move and undeniably builds out other characters within the game\u2019s lore while servicing the story at large. The entire game might only be four hours, however not one, singular second is wasted.\n\nUnlike Crow Country, another low-fi survival horror game that released this year, which gives its player the option to leave combat at the door entirely, Fear the Spotlight sensibly decided against turning Vivian into a super soldier who mows down ghosts and ghouls while trawling the locker bays. Although she\u2019s resourceful, she is young, in over her head, and she\u2019s absolutely terrified, which I think is evident through several of the design choices in the game\u2014particularly the one to not give Vivian any offensive firepower, whatsoever.\n\nThe character\u2019s fear and vulnerability is integral to not only the game\u2019s overarching themes, it also plays into the tense, hide and seek encounters with the fearsome titular antagonist, Spotlight. Leaving embers in his wake, he has sure but uncertain ties to the 1991 fire. He\u2019s a tall, slender figure with an ominous, oscillating light for a head, which strikes a horrifying picture whenever he shows unexpectedly, forcing you to sneak behind and underneath desks toward the nearest door. Seeing the ashen ghouls, who I presume are symbolic of the students lost, peering around corners and watching you is unsettling as it is, but Spotlight\u2019s sudden and heart-pounding appearances teeter at the periphery of being iconic.\n\nWhere other games might equip you with herbs or bandages to patch your cuts up with, Fear the Spotlight once again leans full bodied into Vivian\u2019s anxiety which can spike during these panicked chases. All it takes is a quick puff of her one-and-done inhalers with each hit serving as a calming cure-all for these moments of dread.\n\nShe\u2019s able to make use of her book smarts to solve several of the game\u2019s riddles which, in keeping with genre tropes, often involve scouring the immediate areas for key items before backtracking and piecing the whole picture together. I enjoyed all of the puzzles in Fear the Spotlight, even if they do lean ever-so-slightly towards being too simple, there\u2019s a satisfying flow that sees each problem Vivian faces snowball into the next, and it really helps keeping a great pace up.\n\nAs I mentioned in the opening, there\u2019s a wonderful, tactile feel to this game\u2019s world and its objects. You mightn\u2019t be able to thoroughly examine and turn items in-hand, however there\u2019s an interactivity to everything that kept me locked in throughout. Whether it\u2019s prying nails out of boarded windows, thumbing open the latch on a toolbox, or dialling in a phone number on a pay phone, you\u2019re charged with every input and it\u2019s a cool, albeit simple, touch.\n\nDespite an obvious, and deliberate, lack of fidelity due to the developer\u2019s pursuit of the in vogue retro, lo-fi aesthetic, everything still has a surprising amount of detail. Obviously it carries with it the warts of the style, with plenty of clipping and blocky textures, however it\u2019s one that lends itself so well to horror. The environment design is excellent, with the school itself getting extra credit for twisting its everyday halls into something dark and worthy of the tragedy that the school faculty swept under the rug. Darkness and shadow is used to great effect, as the dithering, the grain effect that helps cement the dated appearance Fear the Spotlight is shooting for, helps in creating optical illusions.\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no real danger through so much of the game, you still second guess what the hard-to-see hallucination at the end of the hall could be. I also love that the game doesn\u2019t resort to jump scares to unsettle its audience, relying solely on a slow, steady build to keep the player on edge.\n\nUnlike some of its contemporaries, Sunnyside High\u2019s map isn\u2019t an open one. This creates a feeling of linearity throughout, which itself feels like a guiding hand showing the way. By solving small, self-contained zones one at a time, it minimises the laborious, time-consuming backtracking that often plagues games like this, but it certainly shines a spotlight, so to speak, on both the game\u2019s overall lack of difficulty and brevity.\n\nFear the Spotlight might only clock in at around four hours, but it\u2019s so well-paced and its puzzles, for the most part, feel as though they make sense in-world, which cements Sunnyside High, in my mind, as a horror spot that read the brief and passed with flying colours. It\u2019s staggering what a team of two has been able to achieve with Fear the Spotlight, it\u2019s a sublime survival-horror title that delivers in story and tone.\n\nAlong with being a tremendous first blow for Blumhouse\u2019s slate of smaller-scoped horror games, Fear the Spotlight could very well be my horror game of the year. I knew there was a reason I kept out of the library when I wasn\u2019t to school, nothing good ever comes of it."

        "article_content": "Nilpena Ediacara National Park in South Australia is well known for its collection of fossils from the Ediacaran period\u2014a geologic timespan that predates the Cambrian explosion.\n\nAn international team of researchers discovered a new specimen called Quaestio simpsonorum\u2014a pancake-shaped creature that represents on of the earliest examples of complex life on Earth.\n\nThis discovery provides more insight into how animals evolved from single-celled organisms and shows that there\u2019s more to be discovered at this world-famous fossil bed.\n\nAcross the vast expanse of Earth\u2019s 4.6-billion-year-long history, life has taken many forms. With the first microbes likely appearing a good billion years following the planet\u2019s initial formation, the history of life is filled with long periods of seemingly unchanging stability punctuated by moments of immense destruction or practically exponential growth. One of the best known examples of that latter phenomenon is the Cambrian Explosion\u2014the geologic period some 530 million years ago when Earth saw an immense uptick in the complexity of life in its oceans.\n\nHowever, complex life was well underway even before this \u201cexplosion,\u201d and nowhere can this be seen more clearly than at the 150,000-acre Nilpena Ediacara National Park in South Australia. Located on the western fringe of the Flinders Range\u2014the largest mountain range in the Australian state\u2014this national park (as its name suggests) contains the richest collection of fossil specimens from the Ediacaran period (a 96 million-year-long geologic span that follows the Cryogenian period and is known to some as \u201cSnowball Earth\u201d) and the aforementioned Cambrian period. Since this fossil bed\u2019s discovery in 1946, paleontologists have uncovered 40 species embedded in the rock of what was once an ancient seafloor.\n\nRelated Story A New Study Unravels a Major Microfossil Mystery\n\nNow, an international team of scientists lead by Scott Evans\u2014assistant professor of geology at Florida State University\u2014has uncovered what could be one of the earliest (and strangest) forms of animal life to date at the site. Called Quaestio simpsonorum (pronounced kways-tee-oh), this ancient marine animal likely lived around 555 million years ago, and looked like a flattened pancake with a question mark shape in the middle of its body.\n\nWhile that\u2019s puzzling in itself, the more shocking piece of this discovery is evidence that Q. simpsonorum could move on its own\u2014it would have shifted around sort of like a robotic vacuum cleaner, slowly hoovering up all kinds of microscopic algae and bacteria. The results of this study were published in the journal Evolution & Development .\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t other fossils from this time that have shown this type of organization so definitively,\u201d Evans, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. \u201cThis is especially interesting as this is also one of the first animals that was capable of moving on its own.\u201d\n\nAccording to the researchers, as Q. simpsonorum puttered around this ancient seafloor gobbling up microbes, it left behind an organic mat of nutrients, which they describe as a kind of slime. These left-behind trails became trace fossils, which the team also uncovered in its discovery of Q. simpsonorum.\n\nRelated Story Life Might\u2019ve Had a Pretty Electrifying Beginning\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the most exciting moments when excavating the bed where we found many Quaestio was when we flipped over a rock, brushed it off, and spotted what was obviously a trace fossil behind a Quaestio specimen\u2014a clear sign that the organism was motile; it could move,\u201d Harvard University\u2019s Ian Hughes, a co-author of the study, said in a press statement.\n\nThe importance of this discovery extends far beyond just one species that\u2019s been extinct for half a billion years. It gives researchers a glimpse at the gene expressions necessary to create these first forms of complex life, all while adding context to how complex life can form\u2014whether on Earth or some other planet.\n\nOf course, it also gives hope to experts who continue excavating the area that something else might be waiting to be discovered. \u201cWe\u2019re still finding new things every time we dig,\u201d Hughes said in a press statement. \u201cEven though these were some of the first animal ecosystems in the world, they were already very diverse. We see an explosion of life really early on in the history of animal evolution.\u201d"

The animal had the body of a greyhound, a long neck and tail, and a small, nipping beak. Running on four, upright legs, the reptile looked remarkably like an early dinosaur. Yet it lived almost 10 million years before any other known dinosaurs.\n\nA study published last month in the journal Gondwana Research argues that this animal, Gondwanax paraisensis, in fact is one of the oldest dinosaurs ever found. Further support for this finding could solve the mystery of how and where the largest family of plant-eating dinosaurs emerged.\n\nSince the 1800s, most paleontologists have agreed that all dinosaurs share a common ancestor that emerged in the Triassic Period about 200-250 million years ago, said Steve Brusatte, who is a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh and was not involved in the study. They were reptiles called archosaurs, and some had shared anatomical traits.\n\nThose ancestral dinosaurs split into three major subgroups: predatory theropods, long-necked sauropods and the ornithischians. The last group included diverse and well-known beaked herbivores like Triceratops, Stegosaurus and Iguanodon."

There are six related CVEs listed on their sites, five relating to Bitdefender Total Security and one for Trend Micro Deep Security Agent, and all advise updating to more recent releases. Bitdefender Total Security users are advised to be on product version 27.025.115 or newer, attainable through auto-update, and Trend Micro Deep Security Agent users are advised to update to or download product version 20.0.1-17380.\n\nOf the two companies, Bitdefender seems to have had to patch more vulnerabilities than Trend Micro, though all five are targeted at MITM vulnerabilities in some way. Man In The Middle vulnerabilities allow for the interception and alteration of communications between users and given sites, allowing false pages and certificates to appear legitimate.\n\nBitdefender's HTTPS scanning functionality was failing to verify certificates across five key scenarios properly: certificates lacking \"Server Authentication\" specs in Extended Key Usage extensions, incorrect checks of site certificates using MD5 and SHA1 collision hash functions, trust of unauthorized entities who exploit the \"Basic Constraints\" certificate extension, and improper trust of both certificates using the DSA signature algorithm and self-signed certificates, in general.\n\nThat said, Local Privilege Escalation is also quite a major cybersecurity issue, even if Trend Micro is addressing just one relevant vulnerability. Local Privilege Escalation refers to standard users gaining admin or system-level access, and Trend Micro's gap came about as a result of insufficient authentication controls, which doesn't sound like a great issue for software called Deep Security Agent.\n\nFortunately, the related issues have already been addressed in their respective software updates and these problems shouldn't impact Bitdefender or Trend Micro customers anymore. However, it is noteworthy that, unlike many cyberattacks which find other vectors of infection, these vulnerabilities were all found within existing security software installed specifically on systems trying to avoid attacks like these. Sometimes, less is more \u2014 though of course, the applicability of that mentality can vary greatly depending on your industry."
