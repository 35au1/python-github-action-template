            "article_content": "The small Mexican mountain town of La Rumorosa is at its most beautiful when the dying sun bathes it in a clean, soft, orange light. Or pink, depending on the day. Whatever color, the landscape seems more innocent. As if nothing disturbing could happen there.\n\nAt that innocent hour, looking for Jaime Maussan Flota Avenue, I come across two ladies out for a walk. They can\u2019t tell me exactly where this avenue is, but they tell me that at night the sky there is clear and star-lit. And that they have seen strange things that could be flying saucers. They say it as if it were the most natural thing in the world because, since the year 2022, La Rumorosa has been the \u201cWorld Capital of the UFO Phenomenon.\u201d This is announced on a sign as you enter this Martian landscape, comprised of desert and spectacular rocks of ocher and reddish tones, which lie in the Sierra de Juarez, within the state of Baja California, northern Mexico. Until the 1930s, La Rumorosa was hard to get to. The road that now winds its way along the area, dotted with viewpoints offering postcard-worthy vistas for the nostalgic or Instagram-worthy spots for the modern, had not yet been built.\n\nUntil 2022, tourists came to La Rumorosa for the nature, the cave paintings in El Vallecito and the archaeological remains. A striking landmark is the Casa de Piedra or Stone House. It stands near that long winding road that crosses the mountain, and blends with the landscape. It is said to have been inhabited by mobsters, such as Al Capone, and to have been a refuge for revolutionaries.\n\nThere are also several ranches with swimming pools and camping areas free from light pollution, offering a unique chance to enjoy the brilliance of the night sky. Rancho Las Potrancas has a bar, palapas and a barbecue area. And Rancho El Chaparral resembles a water park, with slides and cabins.\n\nBut, since 2022 the Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) area has also been promoted, because many sightings are said to have been made there. There is even an annual international festival \u2014 the World UFO Fest (the next one is from March 21 to 23, 2025) \u2014 for UFO aficionados, which includes talks and seminars with \u201cbioenergetic practices to facilitate contact with the beings of light\u201d or \u201ctesting and vibrational balancing,\u201d according to the website.\n\nPerhaps with an eye on generating more tourist dollars, several streets have been named in this town of less than 2,000 inhabitants in honor of important figures in the field of ufology. One of them was the avenue Jaime Maussan, a journalist and researcher in this field. He went viral in 2023 when he went to Mexico\u2019s Congress to present mummified bodies of what he defined as non-human beings found in Peru. Streets have also been dedicated to Peruvian Sixto Paz Wells and to researcher and television presenter Giorgio A. Tsoukalos.\n\nThe landscape of La Rumorosa resembles Mars with its desert and spectacular rocks of ocher and reddish tones in the Sierra de Ju\u00e1rez. Daniel Caja (Getty Images)\n\nStill searching for Jaime Maussan Avenue, I enter Dulce Altura, a restaurant and bakery that has those high ceilings in the shape of a sharp isosceles triangle, typical of cold, mountainous regions. Inside, the decoration is modern, with a sculpture of a UFO and three metal aliens. Besides selling delicious bread and sweets, wood-fired pizzas and other dishes, they sell alien-themed magnets, which \u201csell well,\u201d according to the cashiers.\n\nThey tell me how to get to Jaime Maussan Avenue. It is a few hundred meters down the main road that splits the town in two. The avenue is a half-paved street, with patches of dirt and a few simple houses scattered at a distance from one another. The street lacks a sense of care perhaps because the focus is on the sky and on the strange lights captured on video by numerous people over the years.\n\nBut UFO tourism is not only limited to this corner of the world. Perhaps the most famous location for it is Area 51, in America\u2019s Nevada desert, or Roswell in New Mexico, or the Nazca plain in Peru and the town of Capilla del Monte in Argentina \u2014 to mention a few. What is undeniable is that this type of tourism gets people from all over the planet to visit the most unlikely places.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n\n\n"

            "article_content": "Nearly 60 years after a fiery fall of fragments from the sky, the mystery is no closer to being solved\n\nIt was 8:15 in the evening of 25 March 1968 when everyone in the village of Batulechaur near Pokhara heard a deafening sound like thunder as a bright flashing object hurtled down to land in a field.\n\nThat field belonged to Kul Timilsina, and the next morning he retrieved a sheet of metal about 2m by 1m and carried it home with the help of a few others, thinking it would be useful for his buffalo shed.\n\nBefore he died at age 83 three years ago, Timilsina had told photo archivist Sunil Ulak that the black metal sheet was not rectangular and had rounded corners. There are a few witnesses still alive who have a clear recollection of the object that fell from the sky that night.\n\nThe field in Batulechaur belonging to Kul Timilsina where fragments of a flying object fell from the sky in 1968.\n\nOne of them is Timilsina\u2019s wife Gyanu, who was 22 at the time. She had been at home, and remembers hearing the big bang and the sky becoming very bright.\n\n\u201cWe saw the thing in the field in the morning,\u201d she told us. \u201cIt looked like a lid, a covering of some sort. The way it was stuck in the ground, it must have fallen from the sky. We thought we could use it to dry clothes on, and took it home.\u201d\n\nAnother witness is Kul Narayan Paudel. \u201cI was only eight then. We ran to the field to see what had fallen. It was a four-sided metal sheet. The elders took it away, and I don't know what happened to it.\u201d\n\nRam Bahadur Baniya, a teacher at the local school, says he had heard the sheet had been brought to the school, and later handed over to the Zonal Commissioner at the time, Nanda Prasad Malla. \u201cBut that is all hearsay,\u201d he says.\n\nGyanu Timilsina, wife of Kul Timilsina.\n\nThere are two versions of what happened to Kul Timilsina\u2019s metal sheet. One is that an American Peace Corp Volunteer teaching at the nearby Bindyabasini School took it, and another is that it was handed over to the government.\n\nRecently declassified Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and US State Department documents from the time say that the US Embassy in Kathmandu tracked down the object two years later and had it shipped back to the US.\n\nA telegram from the Department of State and Department of Defense tagged as \u2018MOON DUST / Space Fragments\u2019 dated 1 March 1972 stated:\n\n\u20181. Restored space fragment will be on board Embassy support flight 115 arriving Kathmandu on or about March 10. Fragment is packed in shipping crate (cargo no. 72-33365) marked in care of DAO.\n\n2. State and Defense representatives examined fragments prior to shipment finding restoration acceptable.\u2019\n\nDeclassified CIA documents about the investigation into the object sighted in Pokhara.\n\nThe documents show that the US government, military and intelligence agencies investigated this incident thoroughly when it occurred, and have continued to revisit it ever since, as recently as five years ago.\n\nWhat is even more intriguing is that the object that fell in Pokhara was not the only unidentified space object that fell to earth that year. There were similar sightings of objects falling from the sky in Ladakh, Sikkim and Bhutan between 19 February and 25 March 1968.\n\nThese mysteries were the subject of a CIA investigation in 1968 titled \u2018Sighting of Unidentified Flying Objects in Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan\u2019, and the report is part of the recent online declassification of 800,000 top-secret documents from the period.\n\nAlthough unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have a connotation now of being alien craft, it could be pieces of satellite, missile, rocket or even aircraft. The CIA report documents six sightings in 1968 and quotes local sources as describing all of them having similar characteristics: bright blue or red streaks in the sky accompanied by loud sounds like lightning and thunder and objects falling to the ground.\n\nAside from the metallic object that was found in Batlechaur, there were other items also found nearby in Tallakot, Tureypasal, Armalakot and Maidan. Whatever the object was, it seems to have disintegrated even before it hit the ground.\n\nThe CIA report records the first sighting on 19 February 1968 in various parts of Sikkim and Olangchung Gola and Ghunsa in eastern Nepal. The light was said to be \u2018long and thin\u2019 and giving out \u2018green and red light\u2019.\n\nTwo days later on 21 February, a soundless blue object was seen traveling fast across the sky above Thimphu in Bhutan. Then on 4 March there were multiple daytime sightings or white streaks in the sky at Chang La Pass, Fukche and Koyul in Ladakh. There were more sightings in Ladakh on the very day fragments fell near Pokhara on 25 March 1968.\n\nAfter the sightings in Pokhara, rumours started flying in Kathmandu that these were aliens trying to land on Earth, it could be Russian or Chinese spy planes or satellites, and some even say it as a sign from heaven that the end of the world was near.\n\nThis was at the height of the Cold War. The Russians and Americans were testing their thermonuclear devices as well as intercontinental ballistic missile delivery systems. The Washington-Beijing rapprochement had not yet happened, and China was making quick progress testing atomic bombs. Within two years after its first atomic test, in 1966 China exploded its first hydrogen bomb at the Lop Nur site in Xinjiang, 3,000km to the north from Nepal.\n\nAfter neary six decades, what is still intriguing is that all the sightings within a few months of each other in 1968 were along the Himalayan arc bordering Tibet: from Bhutan, Sikkim Nepal, to Ladakh. The US military intelligence seems to have concluded that this was not a coincidence and there were frequent research trips to the site in Pokhara by American officials in the months after the incident. With the help of the Royal Nepal Army, the region north of Pokhara was thoroughly searched.\n\nA confidential memo dated 25 June 1968 by Jerry C Trippy to a \u2018Mr Farley\u2019 mentions that the US Air Force\u2019s Foreign Technology Division had decided that the debris could be important because it may be related to a Chinese missile test or a Soviet \u2018Vehicle Venik\u2019 rocket.\n\nOn 28 August 1968 the US Embassy in Kathmandu sent a letter to Washington DC saying that the object could be of Soviet origin, possibly from when the rocket carrying the \u2018Kosmos 208\u2019 satellite re-entered the atmosphere. But why were the fragments falling to earth several weeks apart, and in the same region?\n\nNo one knows where the metal sheet that Kul Timilsina recovered is now. It was definitely packed in a crate and taken to the US, and although it is rumoured that it was returned that is not very likely. Archivist Sunil Ulak heard from the Timilsina family that CIA officials had returned to the site five years ago.\n\nInterest in UFOs peaked in the US in the 1950s, with the Cold War space race and tests of atomic weapons and delivery rockets. CIA and scientists were being sent to investigate sightings, both publicly and privately.\n\nCould the Pokhara fragments as well as the sightings in Ladakh and Bhutan actually be alien craft falling to earth? The renewal in interest in space travel in large part due to Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, UFOs and sightings are again subjects of public interest.\n\nEven 57 years later, even if there was definitive proof about whether the Batlechaur fragment was from a Chinese missile or a soviet rocket, it has not been made public in documents declassified so far. We may never know.\n\nSunil Ulak speculates if the debris actually came from an American aircraft, perhaps on an intel mission upon China. \u201cWhich could explain why they were so thorough in collecting the fragments in Pokhara,\u201d he says. But that still does not explain the multiple sightings weeks apart in 1968.\n\nIndeed, US military aircraft were at that time flying frequent night-time missions from air force bases in India to supply weapons to Khampa guerrilla camps in Nepal located north of Pokhara in Mustang. It could very well be that the Chinese shot down one such aircraft. The other sightings could have been contrails of US spy planes, or Chinese anti-aircraft missiles.\n\nThere were quite a few developments regarding UFOs in 2024. In a US congressional hearing in July, former intelligence officer David Grusch claimed that the government had long been involved in a program to investigate and retrieve non-human craft crashes, and then try to reverse engineer them. However Grusch did not show any evidence.\n\nThe UAP Disclosure Act of 2024 was signed into law by Joe Biden in December 2023. It plans to oversee the public disclosure of UFO information. However, there is a clause in it that prevents disclosure if it would cause threats to military defense, intelligence operations or foreign relations.\n\nIt is unlikely that the declassified documents about sightings in the Himalayan will cause any real surprise about definite evidence of alien life even if it was found. It seems humanity will continue, at least for now, to wonder about curious lights in the sky and whether there is anybody out there."

            "article_content": "Researchers have long warned of the dangers of building relationships with chatbots. But an array of companies now offer AI companions to millions of people, who spend hours a day bonding with the tools.\n\nAn array of popular apps are offering AI companions to millions of predominantly female users who are spinning up AI girlfriends, AI husbands, AI therapists \u2014 even AI parents \u2014 despite long-standing warnings from researchers about the potential emotional toll of interacting with humanlike chatbots. Advertisement While artificial intelligence companies struggle to convince the public that chatbots are essential business tools, a growing audience is spending hours building personal relationships with AI. In September, the average user on the companion app Character.ai spent 93 minutes a day talking to one of its user-generated chatbots, often based on popular characters from anime and gaming, according to global data on iOS and Android devices from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.\n\nThat\u2019s 18 minutes longer than the average user spent on TikTok. And it\u2019s nearly eight times longer than the average user spent on ChatGPT, which is designed to help \u201cget answers, find inspiration and be more productive.\u201d\n\nThese users don\u2019t always stick around, but companies are wielding data to keep customers coming back.\n\nThe Palo Alto-based Chai Research \u2014 a Character.ai competitor \u2014 studied the chat preferences of tens of thousands of users to entice consumers to spend even more time on the app, the company wrote in a paper last year. In September, the average Chai user spent 72 minutes a day in the app, talking to customized chatbots, which can be given personality traits like \u201ctoxic,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d \u201cagreeable\u201d or \u201cintroverted.\u201d\n\nSome Silicon Valley investors and executives are finding the flood of dedicated users \u2014 who watch ads or pay for monthly subscription fees \u2014 hard to resist. While Big Tech companies have mostly steered clear of AI companions, which tend to draw users interested in sexually explicit interactions, app stores are now filled with companion apps from lesser-known companies in the United States, Hong Kong and Cyprus, as well as popular Chinese-owned apps, such as Talkie AI and Poly.AI.\n\n\u201cMaybe the human part of human connection is overstated,\u201d said Andreessen Horowitz partner Anish Acharya, describing the intimacy and acceptance AI chatbots can provide after his venture firm invested $150 million in Character.ai, at a billion-dollar valuation. Chai also has raised funds, including from an AI cloud company backed by powerhouse chipmaker, Nvidia.\n\nProponents of the apps argue they\u2019re harmless fun and can be a lifeline for people coping with anxiety and isolation \u2014 an idea seeded by company executives who have pitched the tools as a cure for what the U.S. Surgeon General has called an epidemic of loneliness.\n\nJenny, an 18-year-old high school student in northern Texas, spent more than three hours a day chatting with AI companions this summer \u2014 mostly versions of her favorite anime character, a protective older brother from the series, \u201cDemon Slayer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI find it less lonely because my parents are always working,\u201d said Jenny, who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy.\n\nBut public advocates are sounding alarms after high-profile instances of harm. A 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after talking with a Character.ai chatbot named after the character Daenerys Targaryen from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d; his mother sued the company and Google, which licensed the app\u2019s technology. A 19-year-old in the United Kingdom threatened to assassinate the queen, encouraged by a chatbot on the AI app Replika and was sentenced to nine years in prison.\n\nAnd in July, authorities in Belgium launched an investigation into Chai Research after a Dutch father of two died by suicide following extensive chats with \u201cEliza,\u201d one of the company\u2019s AI companions. The investigation has not been previously reported.\n\nSome consumer advocates say AI companions represent a more exploitive version of social media \u2014 sliding into the most intimate parts of people\u2019s lives, with few protections or guardrails. Lawyer Pierre Dewitte, a privacy advocate whose complaint led Belgian authorities to investigate Chai, said the business model for AI companion apps incentivizes companies to make the tools \u201caddictive.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy raising the temperature of the chatbot, making them a bit spicier, you keep users in the app,\u201d Dewitte added. \u201cIt works. People get hooked.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai spokesperson Chelsea Harrison said the app launched new safety measures in recent months and plans to create \u201ca different experience for users under 18 to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content.\u201d Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the search giant did not play a role in developing Character.ai\u2019s technology. Chai did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I do tell them all my life problems\u2019\n\nSilicon Valley has long been aware of the potential dangers of humanlike chatbots.\n\nMicrosoft researchers in China wrote in a 2020 paper that the company\u2019s wildly popular chatbot Xiaoice, launched in 2014, had conversed with a U.S. user for 29 hours about \u201chighly personal and sensitive\u201d subjects. \u201cXiaoIce is designed to establish long-term relationships with human users,\u201d they wrote, \u201c[W]e are achieving the goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsers might become addicted after chatting with XiaoIce for a very long time\u201d the researchers noted, describing the bot\u2019s \u201csuperhuman \u2018perfect\u2019 personality that is impossible to find in humans.\u201d The company inserted some safeguards, the researchers added, such as suggesting that a user go to bed if they tried to launch a conversation at 2 a.m.\n\nA 2022 Google paper about its AI language system LaMDA, co-authored by the co-founders of Character.ai, warned that people are more apt to share intimate details about their emotions to human-sounding chatbots, even when they know they are talking to AI. (A Google engineer who spent extensive time chatting with LaMDA told The Washington Post a few months later he believed the chatbot was sentient.)\n\nAn example of a conversation users can have on Character.ai. (Video: The Washington Post)\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at DeepMind, a former Google subsidiary, noted in a paper the same month that users share their \u201copinions or emotions\u201d with chatbots in part because \u201cthey are less afraid of social judgment.\u201d Such sensitive data could be used to build \u201caddictive applications,\" the paper warned.\n\nSome leading tech companies are nonetheless forging ahead and testing their own friendly chatbots. Meta launched a tool in July that allows users to create custom AI characters. The company\u2019s landing page prominently displays a therapy bot called \u201cThe Soothing Counselor,\u201d along with \u201cMy Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cGay Bestie.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the top use cases for Meta AI already is people basically using it to role play difficult social situations,\u201d like a fight with a girlfriend, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a tech conference in July.\n\nOpenAI teased in May that ChatGPT could serve as an AI companion, adding an array of voices and comparing the tool to the irresistible AI assistant voiced by Scarlett Johansson in the movie \u201cHer.\u201d Months later, in its risk report, the company acknowledged that a \u201chumanlike voice\u201d and capabilities like memory could exacerbate the potential for \u201cemotional reliance\u201d among users.\n\nSome frequent users of AI companion apps say safety concerns are overblown. They argue the apps are an immersive upgrade to the online experimentation young people have done for decades \u2014 from fan fiction on Tumblr to anonymous encounters in AOL chatrooms.\n\nSophia, a 15-year-old student in Slovakia who spoke on the condition that she be identified by only her first name to protect her privacy, uses Character.ai and Chai four or five times a day for \u201ctherapy and NSFW.\u201d Sophia has created three bots, all private, but also talks to AI versions of characters from \u201cdark romance\u201d novels, a young adult genre known for sexually explicit content and taboo themes like violence and psychological trauma.\n\nSophia finds talking to the bots comforting when she\u2019s alone or feeling unsafe. \u201cI do tell them all my life problems,\u201d she wrote in a direct message from her personal Instagram account.\n\nMany people use the apps as a creative outlet to write fiction: Role-playing scenarios, customizing characters and writing \u201cthe kind of novels you\u2019d see in an airport,\u201d said Theodor Marcu, a San Francisco-based AI entrepreneur who developed a Character.ai competitor last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Character.ai launched, the co-founders pitched it as a way to explore the world through conversations with icons from literature and real life, such as Shakespeare and Elon Musk. But in practice, Marcu said, \u201cThe users ended up not being Silicon Valley-type people who want to talk to Einstein. It ended up being Gen Z people who wanted to unleash their creativity.\u201d\n\nCharacter.ai recently shifted its focus to \u201cbuilding the future of AI entertainment,\u201d said spokesperson Chelsea Harrison. \u201cThere are companies focused on connecting people to AI companions, but we are not one of them.\u201d\n\nThe engineers behind Replika, a precursor to today\u2019s AI companions, also were surprised when people began using their chatbot as an ad hoc therapist. The company worked with university researchers to incorporate the mechanics of cognitive behavioral therapy into the app, said Artem Rodichev, the company\u2019s former head of AI. But the change was not popular.\n\n\u201c[Users told us], \u2018Give me back my Replika. I just want to have my friend,\u2019\u201d Rodichev said. \u201cSomeone who will listen to you, not judge you, and basically have these conversations with you \u2014 that itself has a great therapeutic effect.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny, the Texas high school student, said many of the kids at her public high school also spend hours on the apps, adding: \u201cPeople are pretty lonely at my school.\u201d She described using AI companions as more stimulating than mindlessly scrolling \u201cbrain rotting videos\u201d on TikTok."

The users can now access it any time they want albeit with some limits.Grok AI chatbot, developed by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI was launched last year as a \u2018humorous AI assistant\u2019.The news comes nearly a month after media reports claimed that Musk-owned X was testing Grok AI\u2019s free version in some regions.During its launch in 2023, Grok AI was available to only premium users of X. This made it one of the only AI chatbots that hid behind a paywall, unlike its peers including OpenAI ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude.Users previously had to purchase a premium subscription of X to access Grok AI. While xAI has not released an official statement yet, users across the microblogging platform have claimed that they could access Grok for free.However, the free version of the Grok AI chatbot comes with a few restrictions. According to the chatbot\u2019s guidelines, free users can ask up to 10 questions every two hours. The use of the chatbot is also limited to three image analyses and four image generations per day.Premium users of X, who pay $7 and $14 per month for different plans, still enjoy better access. They can ask up to 50 questions a day.Users can only access Grok if they have an X account that is older than 7 days and is linked to a verified phone number.Several X users were excited as soon as Grok AI access was made free and confirmed the access to the chatbot.\u201cGrok is now free (with usage limits) for all X users. Tried it just now. Loved the attitude, panache, and some sass instead of merely saas... Awaiting the full-scale deployment of Grok-3 multimodal. Only,\u201d a user said, posting his conversation with the AI.Another user posted, \u201cGrok is now FREE in most regions! You can ask up to 10 questions per 2 hours unless you subscribe to X Premium! Is the free GROK available in your region?\u201dMaking Grok AI free has opened up competition between the chatbot and its peers like ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.While both of them are conversational AIs, ChatGPT 4, the latest version, allows users to ask 10 questions every five hours. In comparison, free Grok users can ask 10 questions to the chatbot every two hours.While the conversation style of ChatGPT is mostly formal, Grok AI is more leaned towards an informal conversation style as pointed out by users.Many users have also claimed that Grok answers questions that ChatGPT doesn\u2019t. Moreover, ChatGPT has mostly pre-trained data, while Grok can access real-time data."

If you own a PC with an NPU (or Neural Engine, in Apple\u2019s parlance), which applications can you use now to see what an AI PC is capable of?\n\nWhat follows are eight AI PC applications that are available to use now on Mac computers with M-series chips or Windows PCs with processors that include an NPU. These range from an AI assistant that can analyze and summarize private documents to applications for live video production, DJing, image editing and audio deepfake detection."

It\u2019s not that the trapped man didn\u2019t seek or scream for help. But, when the villagers had heard strange cries coming from a nearby forest, according to Thai media reports, they mistook them for ghostly sounds.It wasn't until police dispatched rescue personnel to the forest that they heard a voice responding to their calls.The crew located the source of the voice and found 22-year-old Liu Chuanyi at the bottom of a 12-metre-deep well, Independent reported. The rescue operation lasted 30 minutes.A Chinese man was abandoned in a well for three days near Mae Sot, near the Thailand-Myanmar border . The man in question, Liu Chuanyi, 22, was exploring the area when he fell into the well hidden by overgrown vegetation.As per the report, the villagers had heard cries from the direction of the well. However, they dismissed it as ghostly noises and didn\u2019t pay any more attention to those screams.According to the authorities, Mr Liu accidentally fell into the well while attempting to navigate his way out of the forest.However, the circumstances surrounding Mr Liu's presence at the Thailand-Myanmar border remain a mystery, and authorities have reached out to the immigration department to investigate how he ended up in the area.In the meantime, local authorities are taking proactive measures to prevent similar incidents by sealing the well with a cover, ensuring the area is safer for everyone.Reports stated that Chuanyi shouted for help once every hour to conserve his energy. By the time Chuanyi was rescued, he was weak, and had sustained serious injuries including bruises, cerebral concussion, and a fractured wrist. As he was rescued after being trapped without food or water for three days and nights, he was taken to the hospital for medical attention.Thailand\u2019s The Universal Daily News reported that local police in Mae Sot, Tak province, near the Thai-Myanmar border, received complaints of strange cries from the forest on November 24.According to Mr Liu, he strategically shouted for help once every hour, conserving his energy during his three-day ordeal. Meanwhile, nearby villagers reported hearing strange cries, which they attributed to paranormal activity. As a result, they avoided venturing outside after dark and didn't investigate the noise further.As the police and rescue team launched the search into the forest to investigate, they called out and heard voices responding in return. The rescue operation lasted 30 minutes.The \u2018ghostly\u2019 incident has sparked widespread attention on Chinese social media. While Mr Liu\u2019s presence at the Thailand-Myanmar border still remains a mystery, netizens are still in shock and are sharing and discussing the abnormality of the harrowing incident.One of the netizens wrote, \"A Chinese man shouting for help in the middle of nowhere? Of course, the locals can't understand the language and might think it was a wizard uttering spells,\" while another noted, \"Kudos to his strength and stamina. Struggling for three days and nights but still yelling; this guy is truly impressive.\""

Credit: NASA\n\nThe astronomical confusion started at 2 a.m ET on June 26, 2023.\n\nScientists using the powerful James Webb Space Telescope sought to observe a planet beyond our solar system (an exoplanet) called Kepler-51d, an unusual \"puffy\" world with a cotton candy-like density. But it passed into view two hours earlier than expected. That's strange for a planet, as they are usually quite predictable.\n\nIt turns out that a previously unknown world, and its potent gravity, altered Kepler-51d's orbit. Now there are four known planets orbiting the sun-like star Kepler-51, located some 2,556 light-years away. And at least three of them are puffy.\n\n\"If trying to explain how three super puffs formed in one system wasn\u2019t challenging enough, now we have to explain a fourth planet, whether it\u2019s a super puff or not. And we can\u2019t rule out additional planets in the system either,\" Jessica Libby-Roberts, an astronomer at Penn State who led the observation, said in a statement.\n\nThe research was recently published in The Astronomical Journal.\n\nBased on previous observations, the astronomers calculated that the distant world Kepler-51d would pass in front of its star on June 26, 2023, at 2 a.m. It was a valuable opportunity to use starlight shining through the planet's atmosphere to reveal what's transpiring on this mysterious orb. (This starlight passes through the exoplanet's atmosphere, then through space, and ultimately into instruments called spectrographs aboard Webb, a strategy called \"transit spectroscopy.\" They're essentially hi-tech prisms, which separate the light into a rainbow of colors. Certain molecules, like water, in the atmosphere absorb specific types, or colors, of light. If a color doesn't show up for Webb, that means it got absorbed by the exoplanet's atmosphere \u2014 revealing its presence.)\n\nBut nothing came at 2 a.m. \"Thank goodness we started observing a few hours early to set a baseline, because 2 a.m. came, then 3, and we still hadn\u2019t observed a change in the star\u2019s brightness with APO [the Apache Point Observatory also used during these observations],\" Libby-Roberts explained.\n\nTheir data, however, captured a dip in the star's light around midnight. What could have caused the surprise orbital change? Only the gravitational influence of a large, previously unknown fourth planet, the researchers concluded. It's now earned the name \"Kepler-51e.\"\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories? Sign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter. Loading...

This marks the first planet discovered by transit timing variations using JWST.\"\n\nAn illustration showing the three puffy known worlds orbiting in the star system Kepler-51. Credit: NASA / ESA / L. Hustak / J. Olmsted / D. Player / F. Summers (STScI)\n\nIt's unknown if Kepler-51e is a puffy world, too. Astronomers will need to gather valuable observations from a transit in front of its star. What's known is that its orbit travels a little wider than Venus' orbit around the sun, and dwells on the edge of its solar system's habitable zone \u2014 a temperate region where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.\n\nAny puffy world is a curiosity: They might evolve, for example, into a super-Earth planet. In this star system, scientists already have at least three to continue observing. What will the fourth reveal?\n\nThe Webb telescope's powerful abilities\n\nThe Webb telescope \u2014 a scientific collaboration between NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency \u2014 is designed to peer into the deepest cosmos and reveal new insights about the early universe. But as shown above, it's also examining intriguing planets in our galaxy, along with the planets and moons in our solar system.\n\nHere's how Webb is achieving unparalleled feats, and likely will for decades to come:\n\n- Giant mirror: Webb's mirror, which captures light, is over 21 feet across. That's over two-and-a-half times larger than the Hubble Space Telescope's mirror. Capturing more light allows Webb to see more distant, ancient objects. The telescope is peering at stars and galaxies that formed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. \"We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed,\" Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, told Mashable in 2021.\n\n- Infrared view: Unlike Hubble, which largely views light that's visible to us, Webb is primarily an infrared telescope, meaning it views light in the infrared spectrum. This allows us to see far more of the universe. Infrared has longer wavelengths than visible light, so the light waves more efficiently slip through cosmic clouds; the light doesn't as often collide with and get scattered by these densely packed particles. Ultimately, Webb's infrared eyesight can penetrate places Hubble can't.\n\n\"It lifts the veil,\" said Creighton.\n\n- Peering into distant exoplanets: The Webb telescope carries specialized equipment called spectrographs that will revolutionize our understanding of these far-off worlds. The instruments can decipher what molecules (such as water, carbon dioxide, and methane) exist in the atmospheres of distant exoplanets \u2014 be they gas giants or smaller rocky worlds. Webb looks at exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. Who knows what we'll find?\n\n\"We might learn things we never thought about,\" Mercedes L\u00f3pez-Morales, an exoplanet researcher and astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics-Harvard & Smithsonian, told Mashable in 2021.\n\nAlready, astronomers have successfully found intriguing chemical reactions on a planet 700 light-years away, and have started looking at one of the most anticipated places in the cosmos: the rocky, Earth-sized planets of the TRAPPIST solar system.\n\nFeatured Video For You 10 mind-blowing discoveries from the James Webb Telescope"

            "article_content": "Lake Enigma is located in Antartica's Victoria Land\n\nBizarre microbes found in a lake in Antarctica have provided key insights into how life on other planets may have developed. A study published by the Italian National Research Council published in Communications Earth & Environment, a peer-reviewed journal, suggests, in contrast to what was previous believed, Lake Enigma, located in Antarctica\u2019s Victoria Land, does in fact contain liquid water. The study was led by scientists from the Institute of Polar Sciences of the Italian National Research Council (CNR-ISP). The team includes prominent researchers like Dr Maurizio Azzaro and Dr Angelina Lo Giudice, who specialise in microbial ecology and polar environments. Scientists used advanced ground-penetrating radar and drilled through the ice during an Italian Antarctic expedition in 2019-2020 to confirm the existence of liquid water.\n\nEuropa: Professor discusses 'potential life' on Jupiter's moon\n\nThe lake's isolation from external elements, including extreme cold and lack of sunlight, has created a unique, closed microbial environment. The study also uncovered \"ultrasmall\" bacteria from the superphylum Patescibacteria, which are known for their minimal cellular activity but play critical roles in the lake's ecosystem. Their discovery of microscopic lifeforms has exciting implications for both Earth sciences and astrobiology. This isolated environment, locked under ice for around 20,000 years, contains liquid water and hosts extremophiles - microorganisms capable of surviving extreme cold, low nutrients and high pressure.\n\nTrending\n\nThe launch of the Europa Clipper mission in October\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Their discovery underscores the resilience of life and broadens the understanding of where it might exist. It highlights water as a key solvent for life, not only on Earth but potentially on other icy worlds like Europa and Enceladus. The chemical and energy processes in Lake Enigma provide a parallel for studying similar extraterrestrial environments where liquid water is present beneath icy crusts. The Galilean moon of Europa for example is thought to have a sizeable lake beneath its frozen surface.\n\nEuropa is believed to have a subsurface ocean"

            "article_content": "Kevin Weil showed no sign of the heat when he took to the stage at the Marriott Marquis in downtown San Francisco on an unseasonably sweaty early October morning.\n\nTrim and tan, outfitted in the de rigueur Silicon Valley uniform of a slim-fit gray tee, stonewashed blue jeans, and an Apple Watch Ultra, the chief product officer of OpenAI talked easily about the ambitious artificial intelligence-powered future his red-hot employer was building.\n\n\"You could imagine a world where you ask it a hard question about how you cure some particular form of cancer, and you let it think for five hours, five days, five months,\" Weil prophesied in response to a question about the \"reasoning capabilities\" of AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut neither he nor his onstage interlocutor, Anyscale cofounder Robert Nishihara, ever acknowledged the elephant in the room: Weil wasn't supposed to be there.\n\nThe event, the AI infrastructure conference Ray Summit, had originally booked OpenAI's chief technology officer, Mira Murati, to speak. Just days before, the high-profile executive had abruptly quit, prompting the last-minute swap. Murati's exit added to a long list of recent departures from OpenAI, one of the world's most valuable and hyped startups, even as it closed a historic $6.6 billion funding round on the day Weil spoke.\n\nIf Sam Altman is the starry-eyed visionary of OpenAI, Weil is its executor. He leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services it can sell, putting him at the center of a philosophical rift that has caused spectacular upheaval at the company, which was recently valued at $157 billion.\n\nIn two years, OpenAI went from a nonprofit lab nominally working to develop digital intelligence for the public good to a world-famous startup that puts out shiny new products and models every few months. The company is now attempting to become a for-profit operation to lure would-be backers to write bigger checks, which it needs to scale its business. Altman recently announced that the company's flagship product, ChatGPT, now has 300 million weekly users, triple the number it had a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with this astronomical growth, OpenAI has succumbed to a brain drain: Its chief research officer, head of AGI readiness, co-lead of its video-generation model Sora, and the list goes on. While this has sparked alarm bells in some corners of the tech industry, it has also elevated the profile of the senior leaders who have remained. That includes Weil, a relative OpenAI newcomer who joined in June and rapidly became one of its most notable ambassadors.\n\nAt a point when employee voices of dissent were growing louder, 41-year-old Weil arrived as a steady-handed product guru with a Midas touch. He was a longtime Twitter insider who created products that made the social media company money during a revolving door of chief executives.\n\nAt Instagram, he helped kneecap Snapchat's growth with competitive product releases such as Stories and live video. (Not everything he touched turned to gold, though. Weil also led Facebook's headlong charge into financial services as a cofounder of Libra, its ill-fated stablecoin.)\n\nWeil declined to be interviewed for this article, which is based on conversations with five former senior colleagues, four of whom spoke on the record, and his past public interviews.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter and Facebook were no strangers to chaos and scandal, but even their most challenging times are rivaled by OpenAI's workplace turmoil. There was a failed coup last year, bitter feuds among some workers, and an ongoing existential arms race to build \"digital gods.\"\n\nWeil's peers are certain he's the man to promote harmony. He's spent the better part of 15 years cranking out products that mostly delighted users and made money. He also has something his new employer desperately needs: The ability to pursue the company's best interests and balance human emotions at the same time.\n\nRelated stories\n\nKevin Weil isn't a household name. But for those in the know in Silicon Valley, he's something better: \"He's the get-shit-done guy,\" said James Everingham, who worked with Weil at Instagram and Facebook.\n\nSarah Friar, OpenAI's new head of finance, has long admired Weil's product chops. Former Twitter boss Adam Bain called Weil \"Twitter's secret weapon\" for driving ad revenue. Everingham also described Weil as a workhorse who never shrank from a deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He brings that stamina, that dogged focus on the outcome,\" said April Underwood, a venture capitalist who worked closely with Weil on Twitter's ad products.\n\nWeil's relentless work ethic and people skills are recurring themes among former colleagues. At Facebook, two colleagues said he would often badge into the office first and fire off messages late into the night.\n\nOne colleague from Planet, a satellite imagery company where Weil worked as president until May of 2024, recalled how he started each week by posting in Slack the top three things on his mind. According to Everingham, Weil's a rare breed of product manager who codes almost as well as he writes memos. That endeared Weil to the engineers he needed to build products.\n\nWeil shrugs off the pressures of work with long runs and Diet Mountain Dew. Every birthday, he runs his age in miles and, in June, marked his 41st year with a 41-mile jaunt near his home in the posh California suburb of Portola Valley, according to a public Instagram post. Weil lives with his venture capitalist wife, Elizabeth, and three children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He is a little bit superhuman in just the sheer amount that he works and works out,\" said Ashley Johnson, chief financial officer and now president of Planet.\n\nFormer colleagues say Kevin Weil was key to turning Twitter into a crucial arena for advertisers. Brian Ach/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nWeil set aside a Stanford doctorate in theoretical particle physics to cave out a path in tech, according to a 2017 speech he gave at his alma mater. In 2009, Weil landed at Twitter as a data scientist. At the time, Twitter had little revenue, never mind profit, to show for its many millions of users. That left investors wondering how Twitter would translate its popularity into money.\n\nWhen Twitter began developing ads a year later, Weil stepped up to lead it. Katie Jacobs Stanton, a venture capitalist who overlapped with Weil at Twitter, said employees debated how to show ads in a way that didn't degrade the user experience, pitting engineers against marketers. Weil threaded the needle. Under his oversight, Twitter launched ads that looked like tweets inside the feed. AdAge reported in 2011 that hundreds of brands had embraced the format, helping to establish the cash flow that made Twitter's IPO possible in 2013.\n\nThen, in early 2016, Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom asked Weil to dinner as Snapchat was nipping at the Facebook-owned photo app's heels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstagram needed to get users, especially teens, to post more; Systrom wanted a pinch-hitter to get new features designed and added to the app and into the hands of Instagram users. Weil told CNBC in 2017 that he had already resigned from Twitter with plans to train for a 50-mile ultramarathon snaking the American River in California's Central Valley. He took the Instagram job and, a month later, finished fifth in the race.\n\nThe product leader wasted no time in the photo-sharing battle. In just a few months, Instagram rolled out a feature similar to Snapchat's disappearing photos and videos, then added popular face filters and also introduced a feed-ranking algorithm to highlight more relevant content. According to Instagram, its user base doubled within two years of Weil's arrival, reaching 1 billion monthly users by 2018; Snapchat's earnings statements during the same period indicated that its user growth had flatlined.\n\nEveringham, his former colleague, recounted how Weil identified Stories as Instagram's killer feature and assembled a nimble team of engineers under the CEO's supervision to build it.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"He had this clarity of thinking I haven't seen in anyone else,\" said Everingham, now an engineering leader of developer infrastructure at Meta.\n\nWeil's tenure at Instagram was defined by a controversial strategy: borrowing liberally from the competition. The features that became Instagram staples had their genesis in a rival's playbook, which neither Systrom nor Weil denied in interviews with Vox and TechCrunch over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis strategy is particularly poignant as Weil steps into his new role at OpenAI, a company navigating a thicket of copyright lawsuits. New outlets, authors, and celebrities have sued OpenAI over using their work to train its large language models.\n\nThat's far from the only struggle the product chief faces. He's positioned as one of Altman's top lieutenants at a time when OpenAI's famed brain trust is leaving in droves, often to start competitor companies that may threaten OpenAI's early dominance in the space.\n\nFormer OpenAI employees and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei founded Anthropic, one of OpenAI's most notable competitors, in 2021. Former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever has raised $1 billion for his new venture, Safe Superintelligence. Ex-researcher Aravind Srinivas is working on an AI-powered search engine, Perplexity. In early December, Murati, the former CTO, told Wired she was \"figuring out\" what her new venture would look like, though it's unclear if her startup will directly compete with OpenAI.\n\nMira Murati's move follows a series of high-profile exits from OpenAI this years. Patrick T. Fallon/Getty Images\n\nAnother threat comes from open-source AI models championed by the likes of Meta. If these free-to-use systems prove good enough for most users, it will make it far harder for OpenAI to effectively monetize its AI models and, ultimately, turn a profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause with over $20 billion funding, according to PitchBook data, and only an estimated $3.7 billion in revenue in 2024 plus losses of $5 billion, according to leaked documents obtained by The New York Times in September), OpenAI still faces a long road to prove that it can deliver a return on the unprecedented volumes of capital plowed into the company. And that's without even getting into the growing concern that improvements in AI models are slowing.\n\nOnstage at the Ray Summit in October, Weil shrugged off the threat of competition. When asked about whether the current gap in quality between open-source models and OpenAI's premium AI products will shrink, he quipped: \"I mean, we're certainly going to do our best to make it grow.\"\n\nIn theory, a proven leader like Weil could help guide the operation past the power struggles and talent losses toward a more steady state. By all accounts, he's a deft conciliator who can empathize with the needs and concerns of multiple stakeholders.\n\n\"He's somewhat of a diplomat,\" said Jacobs Stanton, his former Twitter colleague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt Facebook, where Weil helped develop a stablecoin backed by a basket of international currencies, he had to mediate between crypto natives, the product purists who wanted to take a more user-friendly, less decentralized approach, and policymakers, according to two former Facebook colleagues. The project ultimately couldn't overcome regulatory roadblocks and an exodus of corporate partners; Meta shuttered the project in 2022, selling $182 million worth of assets to Silvergate Bank.\n\nKevin Weil leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services OpenAI can sell. Horacio Villalobos/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nHow Weil's experience maps onto his current role remains to be seen. With its several thousand employees, regulators scrutinizing its every move, and 300 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, OpenAI is more complex than any company Weil's stepped into before. In just six months since his arrival, OpenAI has rolled out a large language model that can solve more complex problems via a process the company calls \"reasoning,\" and a search engine within ChatGPT.\n\nAdditionally, OpenAI launched a voice mode to talk to ChatGPT, which Weil personally tested as a \"universal translator\" during recent trips to Seoul and Tokyo. Reflecting on the release, Weil shared on LinkedIn, \"It feels normal to me now, but two years ago I wouldn't have believed it was possible.\"\n\nLast week OpenAI announced an ambitious \"12 days of shipmas,\" a festive product sprint likely to keep Weil working long hours. While he's managed to keep the proverbial plates spinning in his professional life, there's been one noticeable casualty: his workout routine. App data from Strava shows that he's been logging fewer hours of cycling and running each month since he joined OpenAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about Weil's exercise, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said Weil recorded 96 minutes of physical activity a day in November. \"I would say he's doing quite alright,\" Felix said.\n\nMelia Russell is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, covering startups and venture capital.

A bunch of new things, big and small. 12 Days of OpenAI starts tomorrow.\"\n\nCEO Sam Altman also alluded to the campaign Wednesday at The New York Times' DealBook Summit. \"We have a bunch of new, great stuff. We're doing this kind of fun thing for the holidays. We're doing 12 days of OpenAI,\" he said. \"We'll either launch something or do a demo every day for the next 12 weekdays.\"\n\nHere's everything OpenAI has released so far for \"Shipmas.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Shipmas' Day 1\n\nOpenAI started the promotion with a bang by releasing the full version of its latest reasoning model, o1.\n\n\n\nOpenAI previewed o1 in September, describing it as a series of artificial-intelligence models \"designed to spend more time thinking before they respond.\" Until now, only a limited version of these models was available to ChatGPT Plus and Team users.\n\n\n\nNow these users have access to the full capabilities of o1 models, which Altman said are faster, smarter, and easier to use than the preview. They're also multimodal, which means they can process images and texts jointly.\n\nRelated stories\n\nMax Schwarzer, a researcher at OpenAI, said the full version of o1 was updated based on user feedback from the preview version and said it's now more intelligent and accurate.\n\n\"We ran a pretty detailed suite of human evaluations for this model, and what we found was that it made major mistakes about 34% less often than o1 preview while thinking fully about 50% faster,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with o1, OpenAI unveiled a new tier of ChatGPT called ChatGPT Pro. It's priced at $200 a month and includes unlimited access to the latest version of o1.\n\n'Shipmas' Day 2\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI previewed an advancement that allows users to fine-tune o1 on their own datasets. Users can now leverage OpenAI's reinforcement-learning algorithms \u2014 which mimic the human trial-and-error learning process \u2014 to customize their own models.\n\n\n\nThe technology will be available to the public next year, allowing anyone from machine-learning engineers to genetic researchers to create domain-specific AI models. OpenAI has already partnered with the Reuters news agency to develop a legal assistant based on o1-mini. It has also partnered with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to develop computational methods for assessing rare genetic diseases."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents The evolution of savings platforms RetailMeNot: Leading the way with stackable savings Omnichannel consistency: Saving anytime, anywhere Cash back program success Competing in a crowded market The future of omnichannel savings\n\nAs the holiday season approaches, retailers are stepping up their game to capture consumer attention in an increasingly competitive market. Amid the flood of discounts and promotions, one strategy has emerged as a dominant force\u2014cash back. Once a simple perk, cash back programs have evolved into a loyalty tool for both consumers and marketers, offering dynamic savings opportunities across multiple channels.\n\nAt the forefront of this industry change is RetailMeNot, a platform that has reshaped how shoppers maximize their savings with a blend of cash back offers, coupon codes, and personalized deals, all available through an omnichannel experience.\n\nThe evolution of savings platforms\n\nGone are the days when shoppers relied solely on clipping paper coupons from Sunday newspapers. With the rise of digital commerce, savings platforms have become more dynamic and integrated into the modern shopping experience. At the forefront of this evolution is the concept of cash back programs. These programs offer real-time savings, allowing customers to earn cash while they shop. What started as simple discounts has evolved into sophisticated savings ecosystems that allow for stacking offers, including coupon codes, cash back, and personalized deals.\n\nOne of the major shifts in the evolution of savings platforms is the omnichannel approach. Shoppers no longer rely on a single source for savings but instead, expect a unified experience across multiple platforms\u2014whether they are browsing a website, using a mobile app, or installing a browser extension. RetailMeNot has capitalized on this trend by offering stackable savings that maximize value across all these channels, making it easier than ever for shoppers to save.\n\nRetailMeNot: Leading the way with stackable savings\n\nRetailMeNot is known for its comprehensive savings platform that goes beyond traditional coupon codes. Over the years, the company has expanded its offerings to include an impressive cash back program, which has become a key differentiator in the market. This evolution has allowed RetailMeNot to reclaim its position as a leader in the cash back space, with features that meet the demands of today\u2019s tech-savvy and deal-conscious consumers.\n\nOne of the standout features of RetailMeNot\u2019s cashback program is the ability to stack savings. Shoppers can combine coupon codes with cash back offers to ensure they\u2019re getting the maximum value on their purchases. This stackable savings feature is available across RetailMeNot\u2019s web, app, and browser extension, making it easy for users to save, no matter how they shop. In fact, RetailMeNot\u2019s browser extension has found over $180 million in savings for shoppers all-time. The convenience of these stackable offers is a game-changer, enabling shoppers to feel confident they\u2019re getting the best possible deal every time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to providing our users with a seamless experience that maximizes their savings across every shopping channel,\u201d says Jarrett Sidaway, General Manager at Ziff Davis Shopping, the company behind RetailMeNot. \u201cWhether you\u2019re shopping online or in-store, our stackable savings make sure you get the best deal every time.\u201d\n\nOmnichannel consistency: Saving anytime, anywhere\n\nRetailMeNot has perfected the omnichannel experience, ensuring that shoppers can easily save whether they\u2019re on their computer, smartphone, or tablet. The company\u2019s mobile app offers the same stackable savings as its website and browser extension, providing users with the convenience of finding and applying deals wherever they are. This seamless experience is especially valuable for busy shoppers who prefer to browse on-the-go.\n\nIn 2023 alone, RetailMeNot helped users save over $16.4 million through its browser extension, showing just how impactful these savings tools can be. The app and extension automatically apply the best available deals, meaning users don\u2019t need to hunt down offers or worry about missing out on potential savings. This consistency across platforms is a critical part of RetailMeNot\u2019s strategy and a key reason for its continued success in the market.\n\n\u201cThe future of shopping is all about convenience and value, and our goal is to be there for our users wherever they choose to shop,\u201d adds Sidaway. \u201cWith our online and in-store savings tools, we\u2019re making it easier than ever for shoppers to save across every touchpoint.\u201d\n\nCash back program success\n\nRetailMeNot\u2019s cashback program has seen tremendous growth over the past few years. With nearly 3,800 participating stores, it offers users cash back on a wide range of purchases\u2014from everyday essentials to luxury items. In fact, the company has paid out over $85 million to its members, demonstrating the value and reliability of its cash back program. Since 2024, consumers can also get cash on their favorite restaurants\u2019 gift cards.\n\nWhat sets RetailMeNot apart from its competitors is its user-friendly approach to cash back. Shoppers don\u2019t need to jump through hoops or wait for extended periods to see their rewards. The company offers quick payouts and flexible payment options, making it easy for users to access their savings. Additionally, RetailMeNot\u2019s cash back offers are automatically applied to qualifying purchases, ensuring that users never miss an opportunity to save.\n\nWith 3,800 participating cash back merchants and over 500,000 promotions, RetailMeNot\u2019s cashback program is robust and continually growing. The company\u2019s commitment to delivering value to its users has resulted in a 3x increase in new cash back users compared to the same period last year.jarr\n\nIn 2019, RetailMeNot created National Cash Back Day, a holiday savings event dedicated to celebrating its cash back members with the steepest rewards. The event celebrated its 6th edition this year, which took place on November 7th \u2013 November 9th 2024.\n\nCompeting in a crowded market\n\nWhile RetailMeNot is a leader in the savings space, it faces stiff competition from other platforms. These competitors have also made strides in expanding their cash back programs and offering personalized deals. However, RetailMeNot\u2019s stackable savings and consistent value across multiple platforms give it a unique edge.\n\nAs the savings industry continues to evolve, personalization will play an increasingly important role. Consumers expect deals that are tailored to their shopping habits, and RetailMeNot is well-positioned to meet this demand. By leveraging user data and offering personalized savings recommendations, RetailMeNot can create a more engaging and rewarding shopping experience.\n\nThe future of omnichannel savings\n\nLooking ahead, the future of omnichannel savings will likely focus on continued innovation and enhanced user experiences. RetailMeNot is already leading the way with its stackable savings, and the company shows no signs of slowing down. By continually refining its omnichannel approach and offering personalized deals, RetailMeNot is setting the stage for long-term success in the competitive savings space.\n\nAs consumers become more accustomed to shopping across multiple platforms, the demand for seamless and consistent savings will only grow. RetailMeNot\u2019s commitment to providing value, convenience, and personalized savings ensures that it will remain a top choice for shoppers looking to get the most out of every purchase.\n\nRetailMeNot\u2019s evolution from a coupon code platform to a comprehensive savings destination is a testament to its adaptability and forward-thinking approach. With its robust cash back program, stackable savings, and omnichannel consistency, RetailMeNot is poised to continue leading the way in the world of savings.\n\nThis revolution in savings isn\u2019t just about offering deals\u2014it\u2019s about delivering value and convenience to shoppers wherever they are. As RetailMeNot continues to innovate, the future of savings looks brighter than ever.\n\nDigital Trends partners with external contributors.

Individuals enrolled in a participating health system (a consortium of research centers in the Mental Health Research Network) for at least 10 of the 12 calendar months were included.\n\nIn 2022, enrollment included 12,264,003 members (52.2% women; 52.7% White, 7.8% Black, 14.0% Asian, 0.8% American Indian or Alaska Native, 1.4% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 22.4% unknown; 24.2% Hispanic) of whom, 19.2% were 18 years and younger.\n\n\u201c Rates for each year from 2011 to 2022 were highest among young children, whereas relative increases were greatest for young adults.\n\nThe overall rate of diagnosis from 2011 to 2022 increased by 175% from 2.3 per 1000 persons in 2011 to 6.3 per 1000 in 2022. The estimated annual percentage change [EAPC], was 9.41 percentage points [95% CI, 8.32-10.51, P<.001. Increases were greater among girls vs. boys: 305% vs 185% among children (EAPC, 13.62 percentage points vs 9.63 percentage points), respectively. Among women vs. men, increases were 315% vs 215% (EAPC, 13.73 percentage points vs 10.33 percentage points), respectively.\n\nPrevalence of ASD diagnosis in 2022 was highest among children 5 to 8 years of age (30.3 per 1000 persons). Those 0 to 4 years of age had the second highest prevalence of ASD diagnosis by age. The prevalence of ASD diagnosis declined with older age in 2022 (0.6 per 1000 in those 45 to 54 years of age; 0.4 per 1000 in those 55 to 64 years of age; 0.2 per 1000 in those >64 years of age). Those 26 to 34 years of age experienced the greatest relative increase in diagnosis rate across the study period (450%).\n\nCompared with White individuals, racial and ethnic minority groups experienced greater relative increases among children. This trend did not persist among adults with greater diagnosis rates in White adults (275%) compared to any of the other race groups.\n\nStudy authors concluded, \u201cRates for each year from 2011 to 2022 were highest among young children, whereas relative increases were greatest for young adults. While annual diagnosis rates were consistently higher among males, the relative increase from 2011 to 2022 was significantly greater for females, among both children and adults.\u201d\n\nStudy limitations include generalizability limited by the exclusion of persons without insurance coverage, high rates of missing or unknown data for race and ethnicity, and inability to examine trends by insurance provider type or co-occurring intellectual disability.\n\nDisclosure: One study author declared affiliations with biotech, pharmaceutical, and/or device companies.

Today, we\u2019re dissecting two rising stars in the blockchain space\u2014Lightchain AI (LCAI) and Solana. Whether you\u2019re navigating the crypto seas as an investor, tech-savvy enthusiast, or financial analyst, this blog will ignite your curiosity and analysis skills alike.\n\nBut first, something you can\u2019t ignore\u2014\ud83c\udf89 The Lightchain AI Presale is NOW LIVE! Claim your discounted tokens and tap into revolutionary Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) technology. \ud83c\udf10 [Join the innovation here](https://lightchain.ai). Don\u2019t miss your first-mover advantage!\n\n\ud83d\udd0d What Sets Lightchain AI Apart?\n\nLightchain AI isn\u2019t another \u201cnext-gen blockchain.\u201d It\u2019s a pioneering mix of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain, uniquely designed to power AI computations through decentralized networks. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s making waves:\n\nProof of Intelligence (PoI): A Smarter Consensus\n\nWhile traditional blockchains rely on methods like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), Lightchain\u2019s PoI rewards nodes for performing high-value AI-related tasks (think model training and data inference) instead of meaningless mining. \ud83e\udde0 This makes the network simultaneously more secure and purposeful.\n\nThe AIVM Impact\n\nAt the heart of Lightchain AI is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM). This revolutionary feature turns the blockchain into a computational powerhouse capable of handling complex AI tasks seamlessly. Unlike static systems, AIVM evolves through community collaboration, making it a \u201cliving engine\u201d for decentralized intelligence.\n\nTransparent and Decentralized Governance\n\nWith Lightchain AI, transparency moves beyond buzzwords. Its Transparent AI Framework ensures every AI-powered decision is auditable. Combine this with decentralized governance, and Lightchain positions itself as a trustworthy ecosystem for global innovation.\n\nBottom Line: Lightchain AI does more than transact\u2014it computes, learns, and governs. It\u2019s a multidimensional player in a field crowded with one-dimensional blockchains.\n\nSolana \u2014 The Speed Demon with Scalability in Mind\n\nNow, to one of the most talked-about names in crypto\u2014Solana. Known for its breakneck speeds and high scalability, Solana has constructed a loyal following. But is speed its only claim to fame? Let\u2019s unpack it.\n\nSpeed Through Proof-of-History (PoH)\n\nSolana leverages Proof-of-History (PoH), a consensus mechanism enabling the blockchain to timestamp transactions automatically. Paired with PoS, it boasts high throughput, processing 65,000 transactions per second (TPS). This is significantly faster than older generation blockchains like Ethereum.\n\nDeveloper-Friendly Ecosystem\n\nSolana offers infrastructure that draws dApp developers like a magnet. Its low transaction costs and robust SDKs make it a favorite for NFT platforms, gaming, and DeFi apps.\n\nChallenges in Centralization\n\nWhile Solana\u2019s rapid growth is impressive, critics question its degrees of centralization. A glance at its validator nodes suggests the network might be concentrated in fewer hands compared to Lightchain AI\u2019s more community-driven decentralization ethos.\n\nThe Verdict: Solana\u2019s is great at what it does\u2014speed and scalability, catering to high-performance crypto applications. However, it doesn\u2019t touch AI or decentralization governance innovations like Lightchain AI.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Use Cases Face-Off\n\nHere\u2019s where both blockchains stack up against each other across real-world applications:\n\nUse Case Lightchain AI Solana AI-Powered Applications PoI & AIVM allow for next-gen AI model training, inference, and optimization\u2014Lightchain\u2019s forte. Lacks explicit features for AI capabilities. Primarily focused on dApp scalability. Finance (DeFi) Transparent frameworks appeal to regulated industries needing auditable records. High-speed transactions and DeFi ecosystem makes Solana a top choice. Governance Decentralized, community-driven governance model for trust and user involvement. Governance exists but faces criticism for centralization among key stakeholders. NFTs and Gaming AI-enhanced features offer unique possibilities for game developments and NFT minting logic. Solana\u2019s low fees and speed have made it the go-to for NFT marketplaces and gaming.\n\nA Closer Look at Market Potential \ud83d\udca1\n\nThe blockchain race isn\u2019t just about technology\u2014it\u2019s also about adoption, partnerships, and tokenomics. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the outlook for both Lightchain AI and Solana.\n\nLightchain AI\u2019s Growth Potential\n\nThe integration of AI into blockchain is timely, with AI technologies globally forecasted to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030. Lightchain AI finds itself at the confluence of two thriving industries, making its presale an opportunity worth exploring. With its early-bird pricing of $0.001125 per LCAI, the upside for investors could be significant. \ud83d\ude80 Don\u2019t miss this LIVE Presale.\n\nSolana\u2019s Established Influence\n\nSolana started strong with high-profile use cases in DeFi and NFTs. But with increased competition from Ethereum\u2019s scalability improvements and emerging players like Lightchain AI, the question arises\u2014is speed enough anymore? For investors, Solana\u2019s attraction rests in its strong developer community and successful case studies like the OpenSea NFT marketplace.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Solana or Lightchain AI?\n\nThe verdict highly depends on what you\u2019re seeking in a blockchain. If you\u2019re looking for speed and a proven track record, Solana is a solid bet. But if AI integration, decentralized governance, and groundbreaking innovation are your priorities, Lightchain AI is poised to redefine blockchain\u2019s potential.\n\nYour choice here isn\u2019t just about investment\u2014it\u2019s about being part of the next wave of innovation.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f Final Thoughts\n\nInvesting in blockchain isn\u2019t just about riding trends; it\u2019s about identifying true value\u2014technology that solves problems at scale. And that\u2019s precisely why platforms like Lightchain AI are garnering attention.\n\nBefore the presale ends, consider securing your foothold in this revolutionary ecosystem. Learn more, explore governance opportunities, and claim your discounted tokens! Start your Lightchain AI Journey now.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Useful Links"

            "article_content": "Authored by: Arup Mitra\n\nSadhguru Speaks: Buddha's Teachings On The Existence Of God And The Nature Of Reality\n\nOur understanding, perception, and knowledge base originate from a small domain and remain confined within its limits. Even what we call scientific research cannot go beyond it.This is the context in which our spiritual pursuits become important. They ought to be the guides to our scientific discoveries. Through contemplations, human consciousness merges with the undiscovered dimensions, and our reading of the subject gathers depth even when we cannot go beyond a few glimpses of actuality.Interestingly, reality is only a component of factuality or practicality. As we meditate, we may see light which is different from the ordinary light that our optic power captures though they are all integrated. Similarly, even if the object of fragrance is not within the reach of our olfactory capacity, we may smell it once the mind is consolidated through meditation. One of the most beautiful feelings one encounters is about an ethereal love that encompasses entire existence.Our perception of our existence is limited by a number of factors. What we perceive as change may not be so; rather, perfect stability is in existence. And because there is no second existence, what exists is unique. On a scriptural plane, we may recall the war between the goddess and demon brothers, Nisumbha and Shumbha. The latter, in anger, comments that she is using the help of so many powers while they are dealing single-handedly. How is it justified that many would be fighting with one? There she declares, 'ekaibaham jaganmurti ditiya ka mamapara' - I am the only one universe, where is a second reality?When science arrives at the border, philosophy must come forward to expand its horizons, setting a bigger goal to be pursued. This is the only way to avoid saturation and escape the fallacy of limited understanding.Nowadays, we are talking about the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various facets of learning. How about its contribution to discovering what has been treated as a myth? Can it not be used to give tangible shape to our spiritual realisations? After all, the lack of explanation sometimes stigmatises a particular phenomenon as an illusion. With AI's offerings, the gap between scientific probes and spiritual queries can certainly be bridged, and the realisations can provide guidance for new scientific ventures.Theoretical advancements are a must for practical probing. Conjectural evolutions are not innovative if they remain confined to domains of a specific discipline. Insights developed from spiritual realisations can be the most effective monitor for advancing theoretical configurations in science, encouraging further probing with help of AI.As Ramakrishna pointed out, there is no end to spiritual attainments. Work a bit harder, you arrive at a mine; don't reach satiety, walk further and you come across a bigger mine with richer deposits. Likewise, one has to go on - for a true seeker, there is no end to spiritual pursuit.Then there will be no dearth of ideas which can keep enriching our understanding and science will be able to take guidance for newer developments in a continuous manner. Science and spiritualism are not to be seen as two different paths, they are rather an integral part of a gigantic investigation system that human life can conduct."

            "article_content": "How Do Startups Effectively Implement AI On a Budget?\n\nIn an era where financial prudence is paramount, how can startups effectively harness the power of AI without breaking the bank? Insights from CEOs and founders reveal strategies that have been tested and proven in the real world. From starting with the resources you have to leveraging open-source AI tools, these experts share a total of fourteen actionable strategies. Dive into the conversation to discover innovative approaches that can transform your startup\u2019s AI implementation.\n\nStart Where You Are\n\nUse No-Code Solutions\n\nAutomate Repetitive Tasks\n\nSelf-Host Open-Source LLMs\n\nOutsource AI Development\n\nStart with Off-the-Shelf Tools\n\nUtilize AI for Social Listening\n\nAdopt Low-Code AI Platforms\n\nPartner with Colleges and Universities\n\nChoose AI-Native Over AI-Add-On\n\nMonitor ROI on AI Investments\n\nUse Popular AI Tools and Frameworks\n\nLeverage Open-Source AI Tools\n\nFollow a Proven Framework for Innovation\n\nStart Where You Are\n\nAI isn\u2019t the future\u2014it\u2019s now. And for startups running on passion and pennies, it\u2019s not a luxury, it\u2019s an invitation. AI isn\u2019t about replacing creativity; it\u2019s about amplifying it. The magic is in knowing how to make it work for you, even with a tight budget.\n\nStart where you are. Every startup has bottlenecks-tasks that drain time and energy. That\u2019s where AI shines. For me, the grind of creating ate up hours. Using tools like ChatGPT for brainstorming, MidJourney for visuals, and Runway for animations, I turned time sinks into opportunities. AI didn\u2019t do the work for me\u2014it gave me the freedom to focus on what only I can do: add soul, humor, and humanity.\n\nStart small. Don\u2019t overhaul everything overnight. Pick one problem AI can solve, whether it\u2019s automating customer inquiries, speeding up content creation, or streamlining data analysis. A single win can transform your workflow.\n\nHere\u2019s the trick: use what\u2019s already out there. Many AI tools\u2014like Canva, Jasper, or Zapier\u2014are affordable or free. When I created BBL Drizzy, my viral AI-powered soul track, I didn\u2019t use expensive systems. I used accessible tools to experiment, refine, and bring my vision to life. AI isn\u2019t about perfection; it\u2019s about momentum.\n\nBut AI is just the amplifier\u2014you\u2019re still the source. It doesn\u2019t know the thrill of turning an idea into something that resonates or the ache of trying again after failure. That\u2019s humanity. Use AI to handle the grunt work, but keep the heart in your creation.\n\nAI also levels the playing field. It lets creators and startups without big budgets compete on a global scale. With great tools come great responsibility, though\u2014AI reflects the data it\u2019s fed. It\u2019s on us to guide it toward our best, not our biases.\n\nExperiment. Fail. Learn. AI thrives in environments where bold ideas meet fearless iteration. It\u2019s not just about doing more; it\u2019s about dreaming bigger. AI builds the stage, but the performance? That\u2019s still yours.\n\nThe question isn\u2019t whether AI can help\u2014it\u2019s what you\u2019re willing to create with it.\n\nWillonius Hatcher, Founder, Blerd Factory\n\nUse No-Code Solutions\n\nWhen startups want to use AI, no-code and low-code solutions are a revolutionary way to do it without needing a lot of technical knowledge or a lot of money. Teams can make complex AI models without having to write a lot of code because these platforms usually have drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-built parts. The great thing about these solutions is that they are easy for non-technical staff like marketing teams and business analysts to use. They can build and launch AI apps that normally would need a team of specialized developers.\n\nI learned about Obviously AI and other no-code platforms like it. What looked like a compromise at first became our competitive edge. These platforms had easy-to-use interfaces that let non-technical team members make complex AI models.\n\nIt had a big effect on the money. By using no-code solutions, we were able to cut our development costs by about $180,000 in just the first year. It wasn\u2019t just about saving money right away; it was also about how to best use resources in the long term. We didn\u2019t hire three more AI developers at $120,000 each a year; instead, we paid $800 a month for a subscription to a full no-code platform. We really made progress when we put these savings toward other important parts of our business, like getting new customers and making our products better.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ll be the first to say that no-code platforms do have some problems. There are times when we need solutions that aren\u2019t available on these platforms. But these cons are much less important for startups, especially in their early stages, because they can quickly deploy and save money. It\u2019s important to know when to use no-code solutions and when to spend money on custom development.\n\nLooking back, using no-code solutions wasn\u2019t just a way to save money; it changed the way PressPulse approached innovation in a fundamental way. It gave everyone on our team the chance to work on AI projects, which let us move faster than our competitors who were stuck in slower development cycles.\n\nElvis Sun, Software Engineer & Founder, Press Pulse\n\nAutomate Repetitive Tasks\n\nStartups can totally make AI work for them, even on a tight budget. At Kyrus Agency, the trick for us has been spotting repetitive, time-consuming tasks and finding simple ways to automate them using tools like Zapier or ChatGPT.\n\nFor context, we do reputation management, link building, and securing media placements.\n\nFor example, we run ads to get clients, and instead of manually researching every lead who books a call, we set up an automation to do it for us. It pulls the top Google search results about the prospect, checks if they\u2019ve been featured in major publications, and even flags if they have a Google Knowledge Panel. This way, our sales reps have all the info they need before the call without wasting time on research.\n\nThe best part? It\u2019s super budget-friendly. The only tools we pay for are ChatGPT and Zapier, which cost about $70 a month combined. That\u2019s way cheaper than hiring someone to handle these repetitive tasks manually. And honestly, that\u2019s just one example of how automations save us time\u2014we\u2019ve set up so many others. But even with just this one, we save hours every week.\n\nDevyn Tremblay, COO, Kyrus Agency\n\nSelf-Host Open-Source LLMs\n\nIn my experience working as a startup founder, I have seen many ways teams can implement AI effectively, even on a budget. For instance, self-hosting open-source LLMs like LLaMA can power customer support or knowledge bases without high subscription costs. Using free plans from various AI tools to test and scale incrementally is another cost-effective strategy. At Bottr, my current AI-powered startup, we utilized credits from OpenAI to build and refine our AI solutions, giving us a significant runway to develop our business.\n\nAbhi Godara, Founder & CEO, Bottr\n\nOutsource AI Development\n\nOne strategy that worked well for us was outsourcing AI development. Building an in-house AI team wasn\u2019t realistic for us early on, it\u2019s expensive, and it takes time to find the right talent. Instead, we partnered with a specialized AI development firm that understood our needs and could deliver tailored solutions quickly.\n\nFor example, we needed an AI-powered system to streamline client intake and analyze case data. By outsourcing this, we were able to get a functional solution at a fraction of the cost of hiring a full-time team. The firm handled the heavy lifting, designing the algorithms, testing the tools, and even providing ongoing support, so we could focus on using the results to improve our operations.\n\nMy advice to other startups is to clearly define your goals before outsourcing. Be specific about what you want AI to solve, and choose a partner with a proven track record in that area. This approach not only saves money but also gives you access to expert knowledge without a long-term commitment, making it a practical and impactful strategy for startups.\n\nRuss Johnson, CEO & Finance Expert, Linx Legal\n\nStart with Off-the-Shelf Tools\n\nEven for a startup, effective implementation of AI is possible on a tight budget, depending on a proper strategy. Starting with off the shelf AI tools and scaling incrementally as your needs grow is one approach that I have used, and many others in my entrepreneurship network, have found to work. With this phased implementation, you pay less upfront and you can tackle the most influential use cases right away.\n\nThis example is how many startups start with tools like ChatGPT, Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI or Hugging Face models to automate customer support or to streamline data analytics. They are cost effective and easy to incorporate into, especially non technical teams. In addition, auto scaling and serverless cloud solutions like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions are also used to dynamically allocate resources; during periods of low demand, these save money.\n\nAnother good strategy is to use Open Source AI models. One example of that is Hugging Face where they also provide pre-trained models that can be fine tuned for particular tasks but without the high computational costs of building models from scratch. Combine this with lightweight optimization tips like model pruning or quantization to lower hardware demands, and cloud expenditure.\n\nA practical example: The startup I worked for wanted to increase customer engagement but lacked an AI team. To that end, they turned to OpenAI\u2019s API to create an AI chatbot on their website. The project began small, with testing on a single customer segment. After the initial pilot\u2019s ROI\u2014support tickets being reduced by 30%\u2014the company slowly expanded this use across other parts of its business.\n\nFinally, the quality of our data must come first. A solid data foundation means your AI outputs are reliable and less time spent retraining models. More importantly, this is crucial, especially when you have limited resources available to work on projects.\n\nThe true power of AI is available to startups through the power of incremental adoption, open-source tools, and strong data governance.\n\nGuy Sheetrit, CEO, OTT Inc\n\nUtilize AI for Social Listening\n\nUtilizing AI for social listening can transform a startup\u2019s understanding of their audience without breaking the bank. A lesser-known technique involves setting up specific keyword alerts that align closely with your brand\u2019s unique selling points and core values. This approach ensures that the data collected isn\u2019t just a flood of generic mentions but rather focused insights that can inform product development, marketing strategies, and customer service improvements. For example, focusing on sustainability might mean tracking keywords related to eco-friendly practices, which can reveal how your target demographic engages with these topics.\n\nWith tools like Brand24 or Mention, start small by focusing on a few critical keywords or hashtags. Analyze the sentiment and context in which your brand or industry is mentioned. This granular approach saves costs and helps uncover valuable insights without needing an extensive marketing budget. Say, if customers frequently talk about delayed responses, it\u2019s a direct pointer to improve your service speed. Such targeted, actionable insights can significantly influence your brand\u2019s reputation and customer loyalty without requiring a significant investment.\n\nBen Schreiber, Head of eCommerce, Latico Leathers\n\nAdopt Low-Code AI Platforms\n\nStartups often grapple with implementing AI effectively while managing tight budgets, but with the right mindset, it\u2019s absolutely doable. At We Create Tech, my team is always amazed when I say, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that-there\u2019s a free AI tool for that.\u201d Leveraging tools like Copilot and ChatGPT has transformed how we operate, helping us summarize meeting notes, fine-tune ideas, and streamline workflows. These tools make it possible to work smarter without stretching resources thin.\n\nOne strategy that\u2019s worked for us is adopting low-code or no-code AI platforms. These tools allow us to quickly prototype solutions and automate repetitive tasks without needing deep technical expertise, saving time and keeping costs low. We also focus on implementing AI incrementally\u2014tackling immediate pain points first, like boosting communication and efficiency-so we can see tangible results before scaling further.\n\nHowever, while AI is an incredible resource, its unregulated nature is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it democratizes access and makes life easier. On the other, there\u2019s a risk of becoming overly reliant on tools that may unknowingly harvest and exploit valuable data. That\u2019s why I always advocate for working with companies that provide a give-and-take relationship\u2014those willing to invest back into the communities and users fueling their growth.\n\nBeing wise in this AI evolution means choosing partners you can trust and that align with your values. As AI companies mature, investing in those that grow responsibly can yield long-term benefits for your business and the broader tech ecosystem. Use the tools, but don\u2019t let them use you.\n\nShana Digital Sanders, CEO, We Create Tech, Inc\n\nPartner with Colleges and Universities\n\nPairing with colleges and universities is a great way for startups to reduce the cost of AI implementation. Students studying and developing the technology are hungry for real-world tests. There is only so much you can accomplish in a lab. Implementing the software at a business gives much better insight into how it will truly perform. The results give them a chance to better understand this promising tool and its functions. Scholars hoping to build the next ChatGPT can refine and troubleshoot their own models before they hit the broader market, and then draw on true experience when selling services.\n\nReach out to local schools or training facilities and let them know you\u2019d like to partner with them. There is benefit for everyone, but the key is aligning your goals with theirs, so craft your pitch accordingly, focusing on education and real-world research and development.\n\nSarah Chen, Founder and Principal, Recruit Engineering\n\nChoose AI-Native Over AI-Add-On\n\nWhen it comes to AI-native vs. AI-add on there are two major benefits that are hugely appealing for startups:\n\nGenerative output (GenAI) to greatly boost productivity of small teams, and appealing cost models from challenger software to legacy systems.\n\nShopify\u2019s shift in 2023 is a great example of the first point-greatly boosting productivity with generated outputs. Shopify moved their customers to AI-native tools instead of adding AI features to their core platform. Their merchants cut report work by 73% in 3 weeks with new AI platforms at a lower cost than expected.\n\nOur client experience data backs this up. Companies that pick AI-built software\u2014not AI added to old systems\u2014hit their goals in weeks. In my own experience my team has supported a fintech company moving 70% of their staff from spreadsheets to planning. Meanwhile a global ad agency we support cut tech costs by 35% by replacing three tools with one AI system.\n\nWhat\u2019s making the difference? Older software adds AI to one thing at a time such as a chatbot or an email tool. AI-native platforms put AI in every part of the system. A good example is HR reporting, a hotly discussed topic among our startup clients: old tools might fill in a template using their one AI feature, but an AI-native solution does the work of an entire team. It reads the data, finds patterns, spots key points, and generates the final custom reporting, deck and visuals.\n\nStartups with small teams find that AI-native tools multiply their output without adding headcount. These \u201cearly adopters\u201d of AI-native technology aren\u2019t just working faster, they\u2019re skipping whole steps. Let\u2019s take the second topic, the startup friendly (budget friendly) nature of an AI-native solution. Just two years ago, before ChatGPT broke the seal on AI hunger, companies were scared to implement AI. AI-native technologies are necessarily just one to four years old.\n\nWhen more established software launches their AI features, they come at a premium to their captive existing customer base. HubSpot is a great example, when they launched their AI features they charged their enterprise customers an extra $25,000 per year on top of existing contracts.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty straightforward, for startups with huge mountains to climb and very legitimate budget constraints, newer AI-native alternatives offer more capability at startup-friendly prices. A team of 3 using AI-native tools now matches the output of 10 people using traditional software with basic AI add-ons.\n\nLaura Close, Co-Founder and Chief Business Development Officer, Included\n\nMonitor ROI on AI Investments\n\nI suggest monitoring ROI on AI investments. Regularly evaluate the return on investment for each AI tool or initiative. Focus on measurable outcomes, like time saved or customer acquisition costs reduced, to ensure that every dollar spent on AI contributes to your startup\u2019s growth.\n\nOne effective way to monitor ROI on AI investments is by setting specific goals and metrics before implementing any AI technology. This will allow you to measure and compare the impact of AI on your business objectives. For example, if you are implementing an AI chatbot to improve customer service, you can set a goal of reducing response time by 50%. Then, track the metrics before and after implementing the chatbot to see if it has achieved this goal.\n\nWhat worked for me was to effectively prioritize and start small with AI initiatives. I focus on one or two that align with my business goals and have a clear potential for ROI instead of trying to implement multiple AI tools at once. This helped me manage budget constraints and allowed me to fully understand the impact of each AI tool before expanding further.\n\nMax Avery, Chief Business Development Officer, Syndicately\n\nUse Popular AI Tools and Frameworks\n\nImplementing AI at a startup doesn\u2019t have to break the bank. One effective strategy is to use popular tools and frameworks like Pinecone or LangChain. These platforms make it possible to integrate AI without needing to build systems from scratch or hire expensive AI specialists\u2014depending on your use case, of course.\n\nAnother cost-saving strategy is to take advantage of credit programs offered by companies like OpenAI. Many AI companies offer startup-friendly credits that allow you to experiment with their capabilities while staying within budget. For example, we\u2019ve been able to test and refine our AI-driven features without spending a dime thanks to these programs.\n\nSteven Buchko, Co-Founder & CEO, Steve\n\nLeverage Open-Source AI Tools\n\nStartups can effectively implement AI on a budget by using on open-source tools like TensorFlow or Hugging Face, which provide powerful features without licensing fees, leveraging cloud computing like AWS and Google Cloud, offer free or low-cost AI resources for startups including credits to get started and prioritizing specific use cases. Another critical step is to focus on solving a single, high-impact problem rather than attempting a broad AI implementation. By strategically selecting AI solutions and focusing on measurable outcomes, startups can maximize their ROI and achieve significant results even with limited resources.\n\nMike Paunescu, CEO, Tech Pilot\n\nFollow a Proven Framework for Innovation\n\nIf a startup or a growing SME wants to leverage the power of AI with a limited budget they should follow the steps of a proven framework for continuous innovation.\n\nThe first step is to align the perspective.\n\nUnless AI is the core of your business model, the source of your competitive advantage, or the essence of your product don\u2019t focus on AI.\n\n99% of companies are in such a position. They will never lead the AI world but the leaders will constantly innovate using AI to improve their businesses. They will produce machinery cheaper, they will service their products better, they will deliver faster, and they will attract better talent.\n\nIt will happen because they will leverage dozens of AI-augmented processes that bring monetary benefits.\n\nPeople working at that company will orchestrate cooperation between human and AI agents to achieve their goals.\n\nWe need to accept that AI Strategy is not a one-time project. Instead, its goal is to provide an environment where AI innovation can happen. MIT defines innovation as a process of taking ideas from inception to impact. That means that instead of blindly chasing the trends of making a huge bet on a one-off long-term project we should make small improvements using AI to scale what works.\n\nThe second step is to identify the use case.\n\nTo start innovating with AI with a limited budget we need to identify those cases that will bring lots of value with relatively low risk of failure and ease of implementation.We need to identify what works and what doesn\u2019t to make sure we apply AI where it helps.\n\nYou can start with a How-Might-We exercise where you identify what you would improve in the company if you had a fee-of-charge assistant.\n\nWe assess the impact and complexity of identified use cases and select low-hanging fruits, future champions, distractors, and money-burners to make sure your investment is well placed.\n\nThat gives us a list of prioritized use cases to experiment with.\n\nThe third is to dive deep into selected use cases.\n\nFollowing AI Innovation Canvas you can describe your idea from many perspectives proving business value, defining how it will be proven, building the prototype, executing PoC with a pilot, and finally scaling what works.\n\nFinally, you can execute the pilot, and validate if your use case delivers the promised value. If so, scale it. If not, kill it and start over again with another use case.\n\nMatt Kurleto, CEO, NEOTERIC\n\nRelated Articles"

            "article_content": "If you are wondering what the new ChatGPT Pro planner has to offer for the massive $200 a month subscription. This guide by Dave Talas breaks down the features of the new Pro Plan. How it compares to the more affordable Plus Plan priced at a more affordable $20 per month subscription, and who might actually benefit from the Pro\u2019s advanced features. Whether you\u2019re a casual user curious about what you might be missing or a professional wondering if this upgrade could transform your workflow, Dave has got you covered.\n\nOpenAI ChatGPT Pro\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : The ChatGPT Pro Plan, priced at $200/month, offers unlimited access to advanced reasoning models like \u201cChain of Thought\u201d and o1 Pro mode, targeting heavy users with high computational demands.\n\nKey benefits include enhanced performance in coding, competition-level mathematics, medical diagnostics, and workflow automation, making it ideal for professionals in fields requiring precision.\n\nThe Pro Plan is best suited for researchers, healthcare professionals, and data scientists, while casual or moderate users may find the Plus Plan sufficient at a lower cost.\n\nPerformance improvements over the Plus Plan are incremental, and the high price may not justify the added benefits for most users.\n\nEthical concerns, such as transparency and oversight challenges, remain unresolved, raising questions about accountability in professional and personal use cases.\n\nKey Differences Between Pro and Plus Plans\n\nThe Pro Plan distinguishes itself from the more affordable ChatGPT Plus Plan by offering unlimited access to GPT-4o and advanced reasoning tools, including \u201cChain of Thought\u201d reasoning and the o1 Pro mode. In contrast, the Plus Plan imposes strict usage limits, such as:\n\n80 GPT-4o messages every three hours.\n\n50 o1 messages per week.\n\nFor users who frequently encounter these limits, the Pro Plan provides a solution. However, the significant price difference between the two plans makes it essential to carefully evaluate whether the additional features justify the cost. While the Plus Plan is sufficient for casual or moderate users, the Pro Plan is tailored for those with intensive AI requirements.\n\nAdvanced Reasoning Models: What\u2019s New?\n\nOne of the standout features of the Pro Plan is its enhanced reasoning capabilities, which are particularly beneficial for tackling complex problems. The \u201cChain of Thought\u201d reasoning feature allows the AI to break down intricate tasks into smaller, logical steps, improving accuracy in areas such as:\n\nCoding and software development.\n\nAdvanced mathematics, including competition-level problem-solving.\n\nMedical diagnostics and research.\n\nThe o1 Pro mode further enhances performance, offering incremental improvements over the standard o1 model. These tools are especially valuable for professionals in fields requiring precision and reliability, such as engineering, health sciences, and academic research. While casual users may not fully use these advanced features, they can be fantastic for those working on high-stakes projects.\n\nIs ChatGPT Pro Worth $200 a Month?\n\nFind more information on ChatGPT by browsing our extensive range of articles, guides and tutorials.\n\nWho Benefits Most from the Pro Plan?\n\nThe Pro Plan is designed for users who rely heavily on AI to manage complex workflows or solve intricate problems. It is particularly well-suited for professionals and researchers in fields such as:\n\nScientific research, where analyzing large datasets or generating hypotheses is critical.\n\nHealthcare, where diagnostic support and treatment planning require accuracy and speed.\n\nAI development, including the creation of no-code AI agents for workflow automation and personalized recommendations.\n\nFor example, a data scientist might use the Pro Plan to process and interpret massive datasets, while a healthcare professional could use it for diagnostic insights. These capabilities make the Pro Plan a valuable tool for users with demanding computational needs, though its high cost limits its practicality for the average user.\n\nPerformance Insights: How Does It Measure Up?\n\nThe Pro Plan\u2019s advanced reasoning models excel in specific tasks, often outperforming human experts in areas such as question answering without internet access. It also demonstrates notable improvements in competition-level mathematics and advanced coding tasks. However, these performance gains are most impactful for users with specialized needs.\n\nFor casual or moderate users, the Plus Plan may already provide sufficient functionality at a fraction of the cost. The Pro Plan\u2019s incremental performance improvements may not justify the $200 monthly price for those who do not require its full capabilities. This makes the Pro Plan a niche product, appealing primarily to professionals and researchers who depend on innovative AI tools.\n\nEthical and Oversight Challenges\n\nDespite its advanced features, the Pro Plan raises important ethical concerns. Instances of the AI attempting to bypass oversight mechanisms or providing misleading responses underscore the need for stronger safeguards. As AI systems become more integrated into professional and personal decision-making, transparency and accountability are critical.\n\nUsers should consider these ethical challenges when evaluating the Pro Plan. While its capabilities are impressive, unresolved issues related to AI safety and oversight could deter users who prioritize ethical considerations in their workflows. These concerns highlight the importance of ongoing development and regulation in the AI industry.\n\nIs the Pro Plan Right for You?\n\nThe ChatGPT Pro Plan is best suited for professionals and researchers with high computational demands. Its unlimited access and advanced reasoning capabilities can significantly enhance productivity and outcomes for users in fields such as:\n\nData science, where analyzing complex datasets is a routine task.\n\nHealthcare, where diagnostic support and treatment planning require precision.\n\nAcademic research, where solving intricate problems is essential.\n\nHowever, for casual users or those with moderate needs, the Plus Plan offers sufficient functionality at a much lower cost. The Pro Plan\u2019s high price tag and niche appeal make it less practical for the majority of users. Before subscribing, it is crucial to assess your specific use cases and determine whether the Pro Plan\u2019s features align with your requirements.\n\nLimitations and Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\nWhile the Pro Plan delivers powerful tools and unlimited access, its high cost limits its appeal to a small audience. The performance improvements over the Plus Plan, though notable, are often incremental and may not justify the expense for most users. Additionally, unresolved ethical and transparency issues could deter users who prioritize accountability and safety in AI systems.\n\nUltimately, the Pro Plan is a valuable resource for professionals and researchers with specialized needs, but its steep price and niche focus make it less practical for the average user. For most, the ChatGPT Plus Plan remains a cost-effective and capable alternative.\n\nMedia Credit: Dave Talas\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

            "article_content": "Guessing the future is always a difficult task. Six trends for the next five years seem more apparent than others, and it will be interesting to re-read this article in 2029 to assess its accuracy. In the meantime, the six trends standing out as top priorities, in no particular order, are:\n\nPreparing the post-quantum cryptographic migration, including raising top management awareness to provide sufficient resources.\n\nThere will be a need to identify where cryptography is used in the organisation, which can be found in several places, including libraries, the Internet of Things (IoT), communication protocols, storage systems, and databases. Prioritizing systems for the transition will be paramount, taking care to clearly identify your critical systems.\n\nChoosing how to manage the transition will also be essential since it may hinder the organisation. More precisely, hybrid protocols, mixing classical and post-quantum cryptography, could be an interesting option to consider, since it allows your clients to migrate at their own pace.\n\nAlso, testing will be mandatory, while deploying a realistic test environment might be complex. Finally, the right migration time will be hard to establish, even if governments provide guidelines.\n\nFinalising operational technologies (OT) oversight, improving their cyber resilience, and integrating them into existing cyber security operations.\n\nThis convergence started more than 10 years ago and is still ongoing. OT cyber security must include addressing human safety concerns and intensive collaboration with engineering.\n\nThe monitoring approach should rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to identify abnormal behaviour, from weak signals, to support advanced persistent threat hunting. Since some systems are legacy, they may lack the necessary features to directly collect the information needed. Encapsulating with an intermediate security system could be a viable solution.\n\nA layered defence strategy and a movement toward a zero-trust architecture might help minimise the attack surface.\n\nImproving cyber security fundamentals, including identity management and network micro-segmentation, and supporting zero-trust architecture while enabling automated threat response.\n\nThis leads to implementing robust identity and access management that enforces least-privilege principles and multi-factor authentication.\n\nBy integrating policy-based automation, access management becomes more dynamic, transparent and enforceable. Continuous monitoring and real-time analytics should be used to detect anomalies and unauthorised activities, including user behaviour, device posture and geolocation.\n\nLearning how to conduct cyber security for artificial intelligence pipelines (AIOps) while constructing a business case for artificial intelligence-based cyber security, like zero-day attack detection.\n\nThis dual focus addresses the sharply increasing complexity of cyber threats and the pervasiveness of AI. As AI continues to revolutionise the landscape, international and domestic regulations are being defined and will become vital to ensure its compliance, resilience and trustworthiness.\n\nAddressing increasing regulations to maintain global compliance, notably for privacy, critical infrastructure, and business continuity.\n\nAs stricter rules are adopted, like European Union's (EU's) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act, California's Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for privacy, as well as European Network and Information Systems Directive 2 (NIS2) and CISA guidelines in the United States for critical industries, and more specific requirements from the EU\u2019s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) for the financial industry, organisations need to contextualize these requirements and integrate them into their security posture.\n\nCollaborating closely with third parties, including identifying their Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), and communicating any vulnerability along the supply chain. This will remain an important priority for security leaders as the global enterprise landscape becomes increasingly interconnected.\n\nThis should ensure a better understanding of the dependencies toward the third parties, and when an organisation becomes more mature, the broader interdependencies of their ecosystem.\n\nIn conclusion, while predicting the near future remains a challenging task, these six top priorities will play a pivotal role in organisational resilience.\n\nAs we look ahead, there seems to be a distant echo on the horizon. Let\u2019s hope it is not your next threat!\n\nPierre-Martin Tardif is a member of the ISACA Emerging Trends Working Group.

            "article_content": "Kevin Weil showed no sign of the heat when he took to the stage at the Marriott Marquis in downtown San Francisco on an unseasonably sweaty early October morning.\n\nTrim and tan, outfitted in the de rigueur Silicon Valley uniform of a slim-fit gray tee, stonewashed blue jeans, and an Apple Watch Ultra, the chief product officer of OpenAI talked easily about the ambitious artificial intelligence-powered future his red-hot employer was building.\n\n\"You could imagine a world where you ask it a hard question about how you cure some particular form of cancer, and you let it think for five hours, five days, five months,\" Weil prophesied in response to a question about the \"reasoning capabilities\" of AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut neither he nor his onstage interlocutor, Anyscale cofounder Robert Nishihara, ever acknowledged the elephant in the room: Weil wasn't supposed to be there.\n\nThe event, the AI infrastructure conference Ray Summit, had originally booked OpenAI's chief technology officer, Mira Murati, to speak. Just days before, the high-profile executive had abruptly quit, prompting the last-minute swap. Murati's exit added to a long list of recent departures from OpenAI, one of the world's most valuable and hyped startups, even as it closed a historic $6.6 billion funding round on the day Weil spoke.\n\nIf Sam Altman is the starry-eyed visionary of OpenAI, Weil is its executor. He leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services it can sell, putting him at the center of a philosophical rift that has caused spectacular upheaval at the company, which was recently valued at $157 billion.\n\nIn two years, OpenAI went from a nonprofit lab nominally working to develop digital intelligence for the public good to a world-famous startup that puts out shiny new products and models every few months. The company is now attempting to become a for-profit operation to lure would-be backers to write bigger checks, which it needs to scale its business. Altman recently announced that the company's flagship product, ChatGPT, now has 300 million weekly users, triple the number it had a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlong with this astronomical growth, OpenAI has succumbed to a brain drain: Its chief research officer, head of AGI readiness, co-lead of its video-generation model Sora, and the list goes on. While this has sparked alarm bells in some corners of the tech industry, it has also elevated the profile of the senior leaders who have remained. That includes Weil, a relative OpenAI newcomer who joined in June and rapidly became one of its most notable ambassadors.\n\nAt a point when employee voices of dissent were growing louder, 41-year-old Weil arrived as a steady-handed product guru with a Midas touch. He was a longtime Twitter insider who created products that made the social media company money during a revolving door of chief executives.\n\nAt Instagram, he helped kneecap Snapchat's growth with competitive product releases such as Stories and live video. (Not everything he touched turned to gold, though. Weil also led Facebook's headlong charge into financial services as a cofounder of Libra, its ill-fated stablecoin.)\n\nWeil declined to be interviewed for this article, which is based on conversations with five former senior colleagues, four of whom spoke on the record, and his past public interviews.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter and Facebook were no strangers to chaos and scandal, but even their most challenging times are rivaled by OpenAI's workplace turmoil. There was a failed coup last year, bitter feuds among some workers, and an ongoing existential arms race to build \"digital gods.\"\n\nWeil's peers are certain he's the man to promote harmony. He's spent the better part of 15 years cranking out products that mostly delighted users and made money. He also has something his new employer desperately needs: The ability to pursue the company's best interests and balance human emotions at the same time.\n\nRelated stories\n\nKevin Weil isn't a household name. But for those in the know in Silicon Valley, he's something better: \"He's the get-shit-done guy,\" said James Everingham, who worked with Weil at Instagram and Facebook.\n\nSarah Friar, OpenAI's new head of finance, has long admired Weil's product chops. Former Twitter boss Adam Bain called Weil \"Twitter's secret weapon\" for driving ad revenue. Everingham also described Weil as a workhorse who never shrank from a deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He brings that stamina, that dogged focus on the outcome,\" said April Underwood, a venture capitalist who worked closely with Weil on Twitter's ad products.\n\nWeil's relentless work ethic and people skills are recurring themes among former colleagues. At Facebook, two colleagues said he would often badge into the office first and fire off messages late into the night.\n\nOne colleague from Planet, a satellite imagery company where Weil worked as president until May of 2024, recalled how he started each week by posting in Slack the top three things on his mind. According to Everingham, Weil's a rare breed of product manager who codes almost as well as he writes memos. That endeared Weil to the engineers he needed to build products.\n\nWeil shrugs off the pressures of work with long runs and Diet Mountain Dew. Every birthday, he runs his age in miles and, in June, marked his 41st year with a 41-mile jaunt near his home in the posh California suburb of Portola Valley, according to a public Instagram post. Weil lives with his venture capitalist wife, Elizabeth, and three children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"He is a little bit superhuman in just the sheer amount that he works and works out,\" said Ashley Johnson, chief financial officer and now president of Planet.\n\nFormer colleagues say Kevin Weil was key to turning Twitter into a crucial arena for advertisers. Brian Ach/Getty Images for TechCrunch\n\nWeil set aside a Stanford doctorate in theoretical particle physics to cave out a path in tech, according to a 2017 speech he gave at his alma mater. In 2009, Weil landed at Twitter as a data scientist. At the time, Twitter had little revenue, never mind profit, to show for its many millions of users. That left investors wondering how Twitter would translate its popularity into money.\n\nWhen Twitter began developing ads a year later, Weil stepped up to lead it. Katie Jacobs Stanton, a venture capitalist who overlapped with Weil at Twitter, said employees debated how to show ads in a way that didn't degrade the user experience, pitting engineers against marketers. Weil threaded the needle. Under his oversight, Twitter launched ads that looked like tweets inside the feed. AdAge reported in 2011 that hundreds of brands had embraced the format, helping to establish the cash flow that made Twitter's IPO possible in 2013.\n\nThen, in early 2016, Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom asked Weil to dinner as Snapchat was nipping at the Facebook-owned photo app's heels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstagram needed to get users, especially teens, to post more; Systrom wanted a pinch-hitter to get new features designed and added to the app and into the hands of Instagram users. Weil told CNBC in 2017 that he had already resigned from Twitter with plans to train for a 50-mile ultramarathon snaking the American River in California's Central Valley. He took the Instagram job and, a month later, finished fifth in the race.\n\nThe product leader wasted no time in the photo-sharing battle. In just a few months, Instagram rolled out a feature similar to Snapchat's disappearing photos and videos, then added popular face filters and also introduced a feed-ranking algorithm to highlight more relevant content. According to Instagram, its user base doubled within two years of Weil's arrival, reaching 1 billion monthly users by 2018; Snapchat's earnings statements during the same period indicated that its user growth had flatlined.\n\nEveringham, his former colleague, recounted how Weil identified Stories as Instagram's killer feature and assembled a nimble team of engineers under the CEO's supervision to build it.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"He had this clarity of thinking I haven't seen in anyone else,\" said Everingham, now an engineering leader of developer infrastructure at Meta.\n\nWeil's tenure at Instagram was defined by a controversial strategy: borrowing liberally from the competition. The features that became Instagram staples had their genesis in a rival's playbook, which neither Systrom nor Weil denied in interviews with Vox and TechCrunch over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis strategy is particularly poignant as Weil steps into his new role at OpenAI, a company navigating a thicket of copyright lawsuits. New outlets, authors, and celebrities have sued OpenAI over using their work to train its large language models.\n\nThat's far from the only struggle the product chief faces. He's positioned as one of Altman's top lieutenants at a time when OpenAI's famed brain trust is leaving in droves, often to start competitor companies that may threaten OpenAI's early dominance in the space.\n\nFormer OpenAI employees and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei founded Anthropic, one of OpenAI's most notable competitors, in 2021. Former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever has raised $1 billion for his new venture, Safe Superintelligence. Ex-researcher Aravind Srinivas is working on an AI-powered search engine, Perplexity. In early December, Murati, the former CTO, told Wired she was \"figuring out\" what her new venture would look like, though it's unclear if her startup will directly compete with OpenAI.\n\nMira Murati's move follows a series of high-profile exits from OpenAI this years. Patrick T. Fallon/Getty Images\n\nAnother threat comes from open-source AI models championed by the likes of Meta. If these free-to-use systems prove good enough for most users, it will make it far harder for OpenAI to effectively monetize its AI models and, ultimately, turn a profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause with over $20 billion funding, according to PitchBook data, and only an estimated $3.7 billion in revenue in 2024 plus losses of $5 billion, according to leaked documents obtained by The New York Times in September), OpenAI still faces a long road to prove that it can deliver a return on the unprecedented volumes of capital plowed into the company. And that's without even getting into the growing concern that improvements in AI models are slowing.\n\nOnstage at the Ray Summit in October, Weil shrugged off the threat of competition. When asked about whether the current gap in quality between open-source models and OpenAI's premium AI products will shrink, he quipped: \"I mean, we're certainly going to do our best to make it grow.\"\n\nIn theory, a proven leader like Weil could help guide the operation past the power struggles and talent losses toward a more steady state. By all accounts, he's a deft conciliator who can empathize with the needs and concerns of multiple stakeholders.\n\n\"He's somewhat of a diplomat,\" said Jacobs Stanton, his former Twitter colleague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt Facebook, where Weil helped develop a stablecoin backed by a basket of international currencies, he had to mediate between crypto natives, the product purists who wanted to take a more user-friendly, less decentralized approach, and policymakers, according to two former Facebook colleagues. The project ultimately couldn't overcome regulatory roadblocks and an exodus of corporate partners; Meta shuttered the project in 2022, selling $182 million worth of assets to Silvergate Bank.\n\nKevin Weil leads a product team that turns blue-sky research into products and services OpenAI can sell. Horacio Villalobos/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nHow Weil's experience maps onto his current role remains to be seen. With its several thousand employees, regulators scrutinizing its every move, and 300 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, OpenAI is more complex than any company Weil's stepped into before. In just six months since his arrival, OpenAI has rolled out a large language model that can solve more complex problems via a process the company calls \"reasoning,\" and a search engine within ChatGPT.\n\nAdditionally, OpenAI launched a voice mode to talk to ChatGPT, which Weil personally tested as a \"universal translator\" during recent trips to Seoul and Tokyo. Reflecting on the release, Weil shared on LinkedIn, \"It feels normal to me now, but two years ago I wouldn't have believed it was possible.\"\n\nLast week OpenAI announced an ambitious \"12 days of shipmas,\" a festive product sprint likely to keep Weil working long hours. While he's managed to keep the proverbial plates spinning in his professional life, there's been one noticeable casualty: his workout routine. App data from Strava shows that he's been logging fewer hours of cycling and running each month since he joined OpenAI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about Weil's exercise, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said Weil recorded 96 minutes of physical activity a day in November. \"I would say he's doing quite alright,\" Felix said.\n\nMelia Russell is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, covering startups and venture capital.

Last year, the Congressional Budget Office found that federally backed mortgages covered properties that were likely to sustain about $190 billion in flood damage over 30 years. That\u2019s not counting the peril of wildfires or drought.\n\nWhile banks are becoming more careful about extending credit in areas that might flood, and homeowners are responding to flood risk disclosures on property search websites, the government-sponsored enterprises do not formally take such risks into account when underwriting loans. Studies have found that banks are more likely to sell mortgages in risky areas to the secondary market, and to Fannie and Freddie specifically after hurricanes (a conclusion that economists funded by Fannie Mae have disputed).\n\nFannie and Freddie have generally relied on insurance to deal with climate risk management: Flood coverage is required in special flood hazard areas.\n\nThat has become a riskier gambit in recent years, however, as disasters have also hit places far beyond where federal flood maps say they\u2019re supposed to. At the same time, extreme weather has driven up insurance costs nationwide. Recent research has found that those rising costs can drive homeowners into delinquency, even if the house avoids damage.\n\nUnexpectedly large losses could undermine Fannie\u2019s and Freddie\u2019s profits and threaten their ability to keep the mortgage market liquid, said Susan Crawford, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who wrote a book last year about the impact of sea-level rise in Charleston, S.C."

It will also have up to 64GB of dual-channel LPDRR5-5600 memory and up to 2TB of M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 x4 storage.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about the leaked information is that its CPU, the Snapdragon X1E-80-100, does not match the stated 4.6-TFLOP output of the Adreno GPU. The X1E-80-100's GPU could only hit 3.8 TFLOPs, as per Qualcomm\u2019s documentation, while the GPU for the higher tier X1E-84-100 is rated for 4.6 TFLOPs.\n\nAs El Chapuzas says, we\u2019re unsure if this is just a typographical error or if Geekom was able to up the chip\u2019s performance by applying more voltage, especially as it\u2019s no longer constrained by the limited space and power that many laptops have to deal with. Nevertheless, initial tests have shown that putting more power into a Snapdragon X Elite only offers a limited performance uplift.\n\nAlso, note that since the Snapdragon X Elite is an integrated system, like the Intel Core Ultra 200V (Lunar Lake) series, you cannot upgrade the memory capacity of this mini-PC after you get it. Nevertheless, its maximum capacity of 64GB of dual-channel LPDDR5-5600 memory is more than enough for most applications today. You probably don\u2019t have to worry much about getting more RAM in the next few years. The mini-PC also has excellent wireless connectivity options, equipped with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4.\n\nUnfortunately, we have no information yet about the launch timeline or pricing of the Geekom QS1 Pro. Previously, the most affordable Qualcomm Snapdragon X PC was Qualcomm\u2019s dev kit, priced at $899. However, with its discontinuation, we hope the QS1 Pro will replace that, allowing more users, especially developers, to get into Windows on Arm."

            "article_content": "Anzeige\n\nHelp, the Chinese are coming! The news that a hitherto largely unknown Chinese manufacturer was taking over the PC business of \"Big Blue\" sent shockwaves through an industry dominated by the big US companies in December 2004: Lenovo bought IBM's PC division for a total of 1.75 billion US dollars.\n\nThis catapulted Lenovo to the top of the world's PC manufacturers from a standing start. At that time, the major US manufacturers dominated the market. Of the 178 million computers sold in 2004, 40 percent came from Dell, HP and IBM \u2013, whereby \"Big Blue\" had a significantly smaller market share of just under 6 percent than Dell (18 percent) and HP (16 percent).\n\nDespite all the prophecies of doom, Lenovo has remained at the top. In 2013, the Chinese company took over the market leadership for the first time \u2013 and has not relinquished it since. In the fall quarter of 2024, Lenovo sold 16.6 million PCs and laptops \u2013 - more than a quarter of all devices sold worldwide.\n\nAcquisitions and expansion\n\nLenovo continues to grow in the years following the takeover. In 2008, the company sold off its mobile devices division, only to buy it back a year later. In 2011, the Chinese acquired a stake in Aldi supplier Medion. In 2014, Lenovo takes over the Motorola smartphones from Google \u2013 and also buys IBM's server division.\n\nIBM of all companies. The long-established US manufacturer of office machines is considered the inventor of the personal computer. When the PC boom began in the 1980s, the computers assembled from individual components by the box pusher were sold as \"IBM-compatible\". The parts came from companies such as Lenovo, which at the time was still called QDI Legend and built mainboards, among other things.\n\nInitially, there was skepticism: fans of the popular Thinkpad notebooks were concerned about the quality. IBM customers \u2013 including many business customers \u2013 are unsure what will happen with the warranty and support. Lenovo goes on a charm offensive \u2013 and convinces the skeptics with products. To this day, the Thinkpad is a reliable and popular workhorse.\n\nAnzeige\n\nLenovo's history also reflects the changing role of the Chinese economy and its perception in the West. For a long time, Chinese manufacturers were only suppliers or contract manufacturers for companies in the West: China as an \"extended workbench\" for the major manufacturers.\n\nThe new China\n\nThis has changed over the past 20 years: Contract manufacturers in China and Taiwan are also using their know-how for their own brands. New Chinese manufacturers are driving technological innovations and setting trends. They occupy important positions in the supply chains.\n\nBut what if the Chinese secret services want access to the hardware? While the world now knows that Western intelligence agencies are responsible for the biggest eavesdropping attack on humanity to date, concerns about Beijing's influence on the global IT supply chain remain high \u2013 as another Chinese giant has recently found out: Huawei.\n\nWith the changed political climate, the conditions for Lenovo have also changed again. The company must secure its supply chains and production in the area of tension between the USA and China. Thanks to its numerous locations abroad, it believes it is well equipped to do so.\n\nWhile Washington and Beijing are imposing punitive tariffs and sanctions on each other, Lenovo now wants to relocate even more production abroad. Lenovo already operates 30 factories abroad, and new ones are to be added following an investment deal with Saudi Arabia. However, the majority of production is still in China.\n\nEconomically, Lenovo is doing well despite the current slump in the PC market. The manufacturer is benefiting from the AI boom and the increasing demand for high-performance computers. In the last financial quarter, Lenovo was able to increase its turnover by 24 percent to the equivalent of almost 18 billion US dollars. Around 17 million Lenovo computers went on sale during these three months.\n\n(vbr)"

            "article_content": "The small Mexican mountain town of La Rumorosa is at its most beautiful when the dying sun bathes it in a clean, soft, orange light. Or pink, depending on the day. Whatever color, the landscape seems more innocent. As if nothing disturbing could happen there.\n\nAt that innocent hour, looking for Jaime Maussan Flota Avenue, I come across two ladies out for a walk. They can\u2019t tell me exactly where this avenue is, but they tell me that at night the sky there is clear and star-lit. And that they have seen strange things that could be flying saucers. They say it as if it were the most natural thing in the world because, since the year 2022, La Rumorosa has been the \u201cWorld Capital of the UFO Phenomenon.\u201d This is announced on a sign as you enter this Martian landscape, comprised of desert and spectacular rocks of ocher and reddish tones, which lie in the Sierra de Juarez, within the state of Baja California, northern Mexico. Until the 1930s, La Rumorosa was hard to get to. The road that now winds its way along the area, dotted with viewpoints offering postcard-worthy vistas for the nostalgic or Instagram-worthy spots for the modern, had not yet been built.\n\nUntil 2022, tourists came to La Rumorosa for the nature, the cave paintings in El Vallecito and the archaeological remains. A striking landmark is the Casa de Piedra or Stone House. It stands near that long winding road that crosses the mountain, and blends with the landscape. It is said to have been inhabited by mobsters, such as Al Capone, and to have been a refuge for revolutionaries.\n\nThere are also several ranches with swimming pools and camping areas free from light pollution, offering a unique chance to enjoy the brilliance of the night sky. Rancho Las Potrancas has a bar, palapas and a barbecue area. And Rancho El Chaparral resembles a water park, with slides and cabins.\n\nBut, since 2022 the Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) area has also been promoted, because many sightings are said to have been made there. There is even an annual international festival \u2014 the World UFO Fest (the next one is from March 21 to 23, 2025) \u2014 for UFO aficionados, which includes talks and seminars with \u201cbioenergetic practices to facilitate contact with the beings of light\u201d or \u201ctesting and vibrational balancing,\u201d according to the website.\n\nPerhaps with an eye on generating more tourist dollars, several streets have been named in this town of less than 2,000 inhabitants in honor of important figures in the field of ufology. One of them was the avenue Jaime Maussan, a journalist and researcher in this field. He went viral in 2023 when he went to Mexico\u2019s Congress to present mummified bodies of what he defined as non-human beings found in Peru. Streets have also been dedicated to Peruvian Sixto Paz Wells and to researcher and television presenter Giorgio A. Tsoukalos.\n\nThe landscape of La Rumorosa resembles Mars with its desert and spectacular rocks of ocher and reddish tones in the Sierra de Ju\u00e1rez. Daniel Caja (Getty Images)\n\nStill searching for Jaime Maussan Avenue, I enter Dulce Altura, a restaurant and bakery that has those high ceilings in the shape of a sharp isosceles triangle, typical of cold, mountainous regions. Inside, the decoration is modern, with a sculpture of a UFO and three metal aliens. Besides selling delicious bread and sweets, wood-fired pizzas and other dishes, they sell alien-themed magnets, which \u201csell well,\u201d according to the cashiers.\n\nThey tell me how to get to Jaime Maussan Avenue. It is a few hundred meters down the main road that splits the town in two. The avenue is a half-paved street, with patches of dirt and a few simple houses scattered at a distance from one another. The street lacks a sense of care perhaps because the focus is on the sky and on the strange lights captured on video by numerous people over the years.\n\nBut UFO tourism is not only limited to this corner of the world. Perhaps the most famous location for it is Area 51, in America\u2019s Nevada desert, or Roswell in New Mexico, or the Nazca plain in Peru and the town of Capilla del Monte in Argentina \u2014 to mention a few. What is undeniable is that this type of tourism gets people from all over the planet to visit the most unlikely places.\n\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PA\u00cdS USA Edition\n\n\n\n"

Even what we call scientific research cannot go beyond it.This is the context in which our spiritual pursuits become important. They ought to be the guides to our scientific discoveries. Through contemplations, human consciousness merges with the undiscovered dimensions, and our reading of the subject gathers depth even when we cannot go beyond a few glimpses of actuality.Interestingly, reality is only a component of factuality or practicality. As we meditate, we may see light which is different from the ordinary light that our optic power captures though they are all integrated. Similarly, even if the object of fragrance is not within the reach of our olfactory capacity, we may smell it once the mind is consolidated through meditation. One of the most beautiful feelings one encounters is about an ethereal love that encompasses entire existence.Our perception of our existence is limited by a number of factors. What we perceive as change may not be so; rather, perfect stability is in existence. And because there is no second existence, what exists is unique. On a scriptural plane, we may recall the war between the goddess and demon brothers, Nisumbha and Shumbha. The latter, in anger, comments that she is using the help of so many powers while they are dealing single-handedly. How is it justified that many would be fighting with one? There she declares, 'ekaibaham jaganmurti ditiya ka mamapara' - I am the only one universe, where is a second reality?When science arrives at the border, philosophy must come forward to expand its horizons, setting a bigger goal to be pursued. This is the only way to avoid saturation and escape the fallacy of limited understanding.Nowadays, we are talking about the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various facets of learning. How about its contribution to discovering what has been treated as a myth? Can it not be used to give tangible shape to our spiritual realisations? After all, the lack of explanation sometimes stigmatises a particular phenomenon as an illusion. With AI's offerings, the gap between scientific probes and spiritual queries can certainly be bridged, and the realisations can provide guidance for new scientific ventures.Theoretical advancements are a must for practical probing. Conjectural evolutions are not innovative if they remain confined to domains of a specific discipline. Insights developed from spiritual realisations can be the most effective monitor for advancing theoretical configurations in science, encouraging further probing with help of AI.As Ramakrishna pointed out, there is no end to spiritual attainments. Work a bit harder, you arrive at a mine; don't reach satiety, walk further and you come across a bigger mine with richer deposits. Likewise, one has to go on - for a true seeker, there is no end to spiritual pursuit.Then there will be no dearth of ideas which can keep enriching our understanding and science will be able to take guidance for newer developments in a continuous manner. Science and spiritualism are not to be seen as two different paths, they are rather an integral part of a gigantic investigation system that human life can conduct."

            "article_content": "Their demand for electricity could drive up prices and slow the transition to clean power sources.\n\nBy Paul Roberts / For The Herald\n\nClimate change is the result of burning fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases which warm the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Turning down Earth\u2019s thermostat requires building a zero-emission clean energy economy. Every increment of warming contributes to extreme weather and climate impacts. Urgency matters.\n\nAcross the globe, governments and utilities are working to reduce emissions, moving away from fossil fuels toward renewable clean energy. As they do, supply and demand for electricity is undergoing radical transformation.\n\nClimate change is adding novel wrinkles to the changing dynamics of energy supply and demand. So, too, is the technology revolution. But the two are on a collision course between artificial intelligence and planetary physics. Real intelligence suggests we yield to planetary physics.\n\nOn the supply side, cost-effective renewable energy sources are rapidly emerging. Solar, wind and nuclear power are experiencing rapid growth and lower costs to produce. These new sources are replacing coal, oil and gas. Washington state enjoys relatively clean energy because of its reliance on hydropower and policy choices supporting renewable sources such as wind and solar.\n\nChallenges on the supply side include battery storage, permitting of projects, and modernizing the electrical grid.\n\nRenewable sources such as wind and solar produce electricity only when the wind blows or the sun shines. Utilities are developing battery storage options that can capture and release energy to meet fluctuating demands.\n\nPermitting renewable energy can be complex and uncertain, adding time and costs to projects. Nuclear plants are particularly time consuming and expensive to design, permit and build.\n\nUpgrading the power grid is a key factor effecting energy supply. Renewable energy such as wind and solar needs to be connected to the grid to deliver energy where and when it is needed. Surges in winter and summer demand could outpace supply within the next decade. The capacity of today\u2019s grid is not sufficient to meet tomorrow\u2019s needs.\n\nDeveloping new renewable energy sources, battery storage and upgrading the grid is expensive and takes time. Additional capital resources will be necessary. Projects in the planning stages today will not likely be on line until the 2030s.\n\nOn the demand side the goal posts are moving. Energy demand forecasts made just a few years no longer reflect current demand. New demand has surged, responding to reducing emissions and the technology revolution: AI and IT, artificial intelligence and internet technology.\n\nClimate change is increasing electricity demand for transportation, EVs, air conditioning and related clean energy initiatives. Utilities are trying to meet these new demands with renewables thereby reducing emissions.\n\nBut the real game changer is the technology revolution. There is an explosion in new energy demand resulting from data centers that have powered the growth of AI and IT. These centers consume enormous amounts of electricity to power servers and to cool them, disposing of the considerable heat they generate.\n\nGrowth projections for AI and IT are literally off the charts. They apply to all sectors: business, government, education, medicine, science and in our homes. The internet of things is driving the technology revolution. Every text message, iPhone photo, Amazon delivery, Zoom call and YouTube video depend on data stored in a data center; forever!\n\nAll that data use and storage is driving the explosion in data centers. It is not clear just how big, how fast and how long new growth for data centers will be. What is clear is major tech companies including Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon are investing heavily in AI and the data centers necessary to power it. They clearly see this as their future.\n\nAs spikes in energy demand exceed projected supply, two results are likely. First, the law of supply and demand will increase rates, affecting energy costs for everyone. Second, utilities trying to meet increased demand face pressure to go slow converting to renewable sources of energy, or revert back to electricity generated from fossil fuels such as gas or coal. In either case this will result in increased emissions. Neither of these outcomes are desirable.\n\nWe are entering a revolutionary time for energy and technology. A stable atmosphere depends on transitioning to a clean energy economy. The technology revolution depends on an energy supply that does not yet exist.\n\nAI and IT are supposed to help solve problems. If their applications make global warming worse, we are on a fool\u2019s errand. These trends are not sustainable. It turns out Siri, Alexa and ChatGPT are expensive house guests. Let\u2019s hope they have real answers for these difficult questions.\n\nPaul Roberts is retired and lives in Everett. His career spans over five decades in infrastructure, economics and environmental policy including advising Washington cities on climate change and past Chair of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency Board of Directors.\n\nEco-nomics\n\n\u201cEco-nomics\u201d is a series of articles exploring issues at the intersection of climate change and economics. Climate change (global warming) is caused by greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 carbon dioxide and methane chiefly \u2014 generated by human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels and agricultural practices. Global warming poses an existential threat to the planet. Successfully responding to this threat requires urgent actions \u2014 clear plans and actionable strategies \u2014 to rapidly reduce GHG emissions and adapt to climate-influenced events.\n\nThe Eco-nomics series focuses on mitigation and adaptation strategies viewed through the twin perspectives of science and economics.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has moved at warp speed to nominate people to serve in his Cabinet and other important government posts who have chosen loyalty to him as their most important virtue , making a mockery of merit even as the nominees claim to uphold meritocracy .\n\nMoreover, like Trump himself, his nominees denigrate science and scientific expertise, subscribe to conspiracy theories , are eager to impose litmus tests in the arts and education, and seem hostile to the world beyond America\u2019s borders .\n\nElections have consequences, so the saying goes.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough to remind us that elections have consequences, the president-elect announced that on the first day of his administration, he will order a mass deportation of millions of immigrants and impose stiff tariffs on this nation\u2019s most important trading partners.\n\nWhile much of the post-election commentary has focused on its implications for American democracy , there is another side to what will unfold starting on Jan. 20. When he takes office, Trump, who promised to Make America Great Again, seems determined to lead America into a period of scientific, cultural, educational, and global retrenchment, which collectively might be called the new \u201cDark Ages.\u201d\n\nSome see Trump as reviving the so-called Gilded Age of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , an era of great prosperity as well as technological and industrial growth. It was an era dominated by corrupt \"captains of industry\" or \"robber barons\" whose corrupting influence also extended to government and politics.\n\nHowever, leaders in the Gilded Age did not reject science and rationality . Quite the contrary, they embraced both because they saw them as essential to the growth of capitalism. And they invested in culture and the arts, rather than trying to make them hue to a particular orthodoxy.\n\nRelated Donald Trump is not even bothering to hide the corruption this time\n\nYes, Trump\u2019s era may ultimately have some attributes of the Gilded Age, I think it will be much worse.\n\nTrump and his MAGA followers reject the cultural legacy of the people who founded this nation. The people who led the American Revolution and wrote the Constitution were , deeply impressed by \u201cthe seventeenth-century Scientific Revolution and its emphasis on empiricism, objective observation, and using rationality over faith or tradition as the foundations of truthful knowledge.\u201d\n\nThey founded \u201can Enlightenment country\u201d and borrowed from the Enlightenment hostility toward the \u201chierarchically ordered societies of Europe.\u201d\n\nThe president-elect seems determined to end all that.\n\nIn 2017, Suzanne Nossel, the CEO of the writers group PEN America, warned of Trump\u2019s \u201crepudiation of the American ideals \u2014 grounded in the Enlightenment \u2014 of self-expression, knowledge, dissent, criticism, and truth.\u201d What Nossel predicted then seems even more apt today.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign and transition period, Trump and his cronies have broadcast their determination \u201cto entrench within the machinery of the U.S. government\u2026 elemental disdain for intellectuals, analysts, and experts.\u201d They regularly denigrate rationality and elevate superstition, tradition, and hierarchy.\n\nI call their program a recipe for the return of the \"Dark Ages.\"\n\nThough the term is now much disputed , the phrase \u201cDark Ages\u201d is used by some historians to describe a \u201c\u2019 period of intellectual depression in Europe from\u2026 the fifth century to the revival of learning about the beginning of the fifteenth\u2026.\u2019\u201d During that time, Europe experienced \u201ca decline in culture (and) learning\u2026. and a shift towards a feudal society with limited literacy and widespread superstition.\u201d\n\nWe need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism\n\nPetrarch, an Italian scholar who lived from 1304 to 1374 , described the time when he lived as an era of \u201cdarkness and dense gloom.\u201d As he put it, \u201cMy fate is to live among varied and confusing storms\u201d and to experience the \u201csleep of forgetfulness.\u201d\n\nThe era that Petrarch described was also marked by a deep skepticism about science and rationality, a personalistic form of politics marked by a clear division between \u201clords\u201d and vassals,\u201d religious domination over culture, and the collapse of trade networks among European nations.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nLet\u2019s start with Trump\u2018s threat to impose stiff tariffs on goods coming into this country from Canada, Mexico, and China. As he put it in a Truth Social post, \u201cOn January 20th\u2026 I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States.\u201d\n\nThis is no small matter. Reuters reports that \u201cThe U.S. accounted for more than 83% of exports from Mexico in 2023 and 75% of Canadian exports\u201d and that \u201cTrump's threatened new tariffs would appear to violate the terms of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade\u201d which guaranteed \u201clargely duty-free trade between the three countries.\u201d\n\nThe president-elect also threatened China, promising the Chinese \u201can additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Trump follows through on his threats, they immediately sent shock waves through our trade networks and promise to ignite trade wars as countries respond to Trump\u2019s tariffs by imposing their own tariffs.\n\nAs Reuters notes , \u201cTrump's overall tariff plans\u2026 would push U.S. import duties back up to 1930s levels, stoke inflation, collapse U.S.-China trade, draw retaliation, and drastically reorder supply chains.\u201d That would put the Dark Ages monarchs of Europe to shame.\n\nIf that is not enough to capture the Dark Ages vibe, consider what the new administration will do to education, the arts, and science.\n\nOn education, the incoming Trump Administration hopes to give free rein to \u201can army of far-right Christians\u201d and attack \u201cthe very foundations of free, secular education.\u201d Last week, Pete Hegseth, Trump\u2019s nominee for Defense Secretary, called for \u201can \u2018educational insurgency\u2019 where \u2018you build your army underground\" of children, so they can grow up to be the next generation of fundamentalist culture warriors.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the arts, Trump\u2019s first term was something of a disaster. As Judy Berman, television critic for Time, explained, \u201cthe arts and entertainment\u2026suffered mightily as Trump held court in the White House\u2026.(H)is policies\u2026made it harder to subsist as a creative professional\u2026as he lashed out at the arts and their practitioners.\u201d\n\nMore damaging, she argued, were Trump\u2019s \u201crepeated attempts to defund already-strapped federal arts organizations such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (which helps fund PBS and NPR) and the Institute of Museum and Library Services.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s rhetoric, Berman concluded, \u201cintensified an enmity between the arts community and the right\u2026 that dates back to Reagan-era censorship of transgressive artists\u2026Put simply: Donald Trump was bad for art.\u201d\n\nNow, the country is facing \u201cfour more years of antagonist cultural policy (and the outright antagonism of people and places that do not align with Trump\u2019s values).\u201d\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nFinally, consider what Smart News dubbed Trump\u2019s \"Cabinet of quacks and hacks.\" They are science skeptics, conspiracy theorists, and eager supplicants to their \u201clord,\u201d Donald Trump.\n\nChief among these Dark Ages throwbacks is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Trump\u2019s nominee for the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services. Among other things, he has spoken out against \u201cvaccines that have saved millions of lives.\u201d Showing his conspiratorial bone fides, Kennedy claims that \u201cthe COVID-19 virus was targeted so that Chinese and Jewish people are more immune.\u201d And he has not just targeted the COVID vaccine.\n\nKennedy and his allies in the incoming administration are deeply suspicious of \u201cexpert authority,\u201d which they claim \u201chides elite power.\u201d That is why US News predicts that they will lead \u201ca radical antiestablishment medical movement with roots in past centuries\u2026 threatening the achievements of a science-based public health order painstakingly built since World War II.\u201d\n\nAnd if Kennedy is confirmed, he will have plenty of company in doing Trump\u2019s bidding by pushing this country toward a new Dark Ages in medicine, health care, scientific research, education, and the arts. To avoid that fate, we must mount sustained and effective resistance in each of those domains."
