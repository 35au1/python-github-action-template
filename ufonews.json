            "article_content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nU.S. Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ), who posted to his X (formerly known as Twitter) account Friday a video he took of swarms of mysterious drones that have been spotted nightly during the past few weeks, said he was increasingly concerned about the unexplained phenomenon.\n\nKim, who joined local police in rural Clinton Township, New Jersey, 36 miles north of Trenton, said he spotted small clusters of two to four drones a number of times throughout the evening.\n\n\u201cWe often saw about 5-7 lights at a time that were low and not associated with aircraft we could see on the tracker app,\u201d Kim said, noting that the group used a flight tracker app to distinguish the drones from airplanes. \u201cSome hovered while others moved across the horizon.\u201d\n\nLast night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here\u2019s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDn \u2014 Andy Kim (@AndyKimNJ) December 13, 2024\n\nKim said police have tried to get close to the drones using helicopters, but when approached, the drones would turn off their lights and go dark, echoing a statement by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis has gone on for weeks,\u201d Kim wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren\u2019t able to track these devices to determine origin, and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and countermeasures.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, eyewitnesses are pushing back against government claims that the drones pose no threat to communities or infrastructure. The growing story has spread to New York, Maryland, and Connecticut, where officials are demanding answers, while new reports of \u201ccar-sized\u201d UFOs were registered in California and parts of Europe.\n\n\u201cWhy is no one talking about the incident that caused an evac helicopter to not be able to pick up a patient due to these drones being in the way of where the helicopter had to go, and made the helicopter turn around and not be able to get the patient?\u201d New Jersey resident Roseann Stanley said on X. \u201cYet they are saying these drones have not caused any problems. That is a huge problem.\u201d\n\nOn November 26, a medical helicopter heading to an accident in Branchburg Township in Somerset County was unable to pick up an injured patient due to drones hovering near the landing zone, according to a report by New Jersey media outlet NJ.com.\n\nHundreds of drones were first spotted in mid-November flying over New Jersey; eyewitnesses have reported seeing convoys of drones almost every night since then and have described the crafts, in some cases, as being as big as the hood of a car, and performing in more sophisticated ways than off-the-shelf, consumer-oriented drones.\n\nThough the mysterious objects have been reported in the vicinity of a number of New Jersey-based military installations, with speculation about their provenance ranging from aliens from outer space to Iranian spycraft, Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Wednesday that no government facilities have been threatened by the drones.\n\nWhite House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said during a press conference on Thursday that \u201cwhile there is no known malicious activity occurring, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight a gap in authorities.\u201d\n\nKirby argued for new legislation that will better \u201cidentify and mitigate any potential threats to airports or other critical infrastructure, and so that state and local authorities are provided all the tools that they need to respond to such threats as well.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, many people believe the whole thing is much ado about nothing, and probably a stunt of some kind.\n\n\u201cI think these are just normal drones,\u201d Joseph Steinberg, a local resident, told Decrypt. \u201cMy daughter saw a large one, I went outside with her and we looked, but it was hard to judge the size.\u201d\n\n\"The first problem in situations like this is that beyond the initial drone sightings, you quickly get an overwhelming number of reports of things that aren\u2019t drones,\" Grant Jordan, the CEO of San Diego-based drone detection software company SkySafe, told Decrypt. \"When I look at these videos, the vast majority\u201499 out of 100\u2014aren't drones. They're aircraft, helicopters, satellites.\"\n\nAs Jordan explained, the flood of recent drone reports in New Jersey reveals two issues. First, people rarely observe the night sky, and mistake normal air traffic\u2014flashing lights, moving objects\u2014for something unusual. Second, judging the size and distance in the sky is difficult.\n\nWhile Jordan did not attribute these ongoing sightings to a growing hysteria, he did caution that copycats are likely at work, trying to capitalize on the public\u2019s fear and interest.\n\n\"When a story like this gets attention, it draws more people in\u2014some flying drones to look for others, and some just flying them to mess with people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are now seeing these drones in San Diego and the videos that were shown, it's just standard air traffic going into the San Diego Airport.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nWhistleblowers have claimed there is a secret Pentagon UFO data retrieval program codenamed Immaculate Constellation. The program supposedly is used to \u201cdetect\u201d and \u201cquarantine\u201d the military\u2019s best UFO imagery, videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis program has supposedly been hidden from Congressional oversight since 2017, the whistleblowers claim. Immaculate Constellation is what is known, according to a government source, as an \u201cUnacknowledged Special Access Program,\u201d or USAP.\n\nNaturally, a Pentagon spokesperson denied the existence of the program. Really though, what else could they have said about a government program that the whistleblowers claim is \u201cabove top secret?\u201d\n\nThis week, more fuel was added to the conspiratorial fire when an email containing UFO images allegedly from the U.S. military were leaked online by an anonymous source.\n\nAccording to DailyMail.com\u2026\n\nThe black-and-white images show ornately spiked \u2018cruciform\u2019 UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating \u2018hot\u2019 cube, traditional flying saucers and several other craft that look straight out of classic science fiction. The screengrabs are said to be from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by military \u2018heads up displays,\u2019 but details were redacted to protect both sensitive US national security interests.\n\n\u201cThis person has asked me to redact their email address, although I can tell you that there is nothing identifiable in it,\u201d said Nathan Latvaitis of the YouTube channel Strange Mysteries, which has almost two million subscribers and is where the images were first made public.\n\n\u201cThe UAPs [Unidentified Aerial Phenomena] observed demonstrate capabilities far beyond conventional aerospace benchmarks,\u201d the whistleblower wrote about the photographs that were allegedly taken at sensitive military locations.\n\n\u201cShape-shifting has been observed \u2014 possibly due to advanced cloaking or optical refraction \u2014 referred to as \u2018morphogenic behavior,\u2019 allowing for adaptation to environments or missions,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also addressed those who doubt the images authenticity.\n\n\u201cMany traditional media outlets would require verification of my identity and credentials,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is not feasible due to the risks involved. [Those news media] organizations, despite their best intentions, are not equipped to handle the level of secrecy and potential retaliation associated with this information.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was part of one of the legacy programs,\u201d he continued. \u201cI know that\u2019s vague, but unfortunately that\u2019s all I can offer at this point.\u201d\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger, founder of the website Public, was one of the witnesses to testify before Congress in November. He said in his testimony that the Immaculate Constellation program has thousands of images of UFOs.\n\n\u201cWhat the American people need to know is that the U.S., military and intelligence community are sitting on a huge amount of visual and other information: still photos, video, photos, other sensor information, and they have for a very long time,\u201d Shellenberger said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not those fuzzy photos and videos that we\u2019ve been given. There\u2019s very clear, high resolution [images].\u201d"

While some believe the objects could be Iranian drones sent to spy on Americans, the truth might be far less thrilling.\n\nAccording to a post shared on X, the unidentified objects are most likely just one object, a drone developed by PteroDynamics. The XP-4 is one of the company\u2019s latest technological developments, and it\u2019s being developed for the U.S. Navy as a logistics and recon drone.\n\nThis matches the videos I've seen and certainly helps explain the government's odd response. pic.twitter.com/RiOVhspWEY \u2014 Samuel Hammond \ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udfdb (@hamandcheese) December 13, 2024\n\nPart of the confusion surrounding New Jersey\u2019s mysterious UFO reports, though, is the response from the U.S. government, which has continued to say that they aren\u2019t sure who the flying objects belong to. Based on the news shared on X, though, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case at all.\n\nHowever, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that the U.S. government has been secretive about something like this. In fact, the government continues to hold the specifics of the various missions that its secret space plane are conducting close to the chest. And, since the XP-4 is a drone designed for the U.S. military, it makes sense it wouldn\u2019t want to talk about it too openly if it were behind sightings of New Jersey\u2019s mysterious UFOs.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nHowever, not everyone will buy this explanation. Some will likely still continue to hold that New Jersey\u2019s mysterious UFOs are drones spying for other countries. What makes the PteroDynamics angle so believable, though, is the fact that the drone is the same size as what has been reported.\n\nAdditionally, the XP-4\u2019s flight path matches with the reported sightings that have been coming in over the past several weeks in New Jersey. All of that tied together with the U.S. governments reluctance to say exactly who the drones belong to could very well point to this being the truth."

The \u201capp function\u201d feature likely provides Gemini capabilities to automate daily phone activities with little to no human intervention.\n\nGoogle explains the \u201capp function\u201d as \u201ca specific piece of functionality that an app offers to the system,\u201d adding that \u201cthese functionalities can be integrated into various system features.\u201d It will let \u201capplications \u2026 execute functions they define.\u201d\n\nThis means Gemini can execute a specific function of an application when triggered or called upon by the system, as long as such a function is \u201cregistered and made available.\u201d In other words, Gemini can shop online using the phone\u2019s app with very little or no intervention from the user. For example, an \u201corderFood\u201d function lets the AI assistant do the job without the need for the user to open a food delivery service app to order pizza.\n\nGemini is currently the default AI assistant for most Android phones and devices. However, the upgraded Gemini would be more than just an AI assistant that interacts with phone apps and external services\u2014giving it the capacity to control the functions inside the applications on behalf of the phone\u2019s user adds a hefty measure of utility and power to smartphones."

            "article_content": "Increasingly, over the last few decades, modern pop culture has warmed up to embracing the frightful chills of the winter holidays in films like Gremlins, Black Christmas, Terrifier 3 \u2026 Love Actually. But the historical roots of this time of year have always had a darker, spookier side. Long before Charles Dickens\u2019 A Christmas Carol \u2014 an era when families of Victorian England gathered to share ghost stories by the fire on Christmas Eve \u2014 pre-Christian folklore told of a thin veil between worlds, where spirits (and goblins, beasts, and gods) lingered during the winter solstice.\n\nThose ancient beliefs blend with modern natural introspection of the holidays. Along with the (sometimes saccharine) jubilations, Christmas and the winter festivities encourage people to reflect on the past, lost loved ones, and the lingering \u201cghosts\u201d of memory. Add to that how this month is populated by magical home invaders, and a creepy surveillance imp on the shelf, and December is a rather fitting time for mystery, the macabre, and paranormal tales.\n\nCelebrating the scarier side of the holidays is not only a sort of subversive counter-programming by pairing cheer with fear, it allows us to acknowledge the dichotomy of light and dark, contrasting cozy, nostalgic evenings with long, eerily silent nights.\n\nAll of this is a very drawn out way of saying I love getting creepy, spooky, and downright scary gifts for the holidays, and I love shopping for loved ones who also appreciate a little splash of blood red with their Christmases so white. And so, we return with a Talking Strange Show \u201cSeason\u2019s Screamings Gift Guide\u201d for 2024. After the success of last year\u2019s guide, we are going bigger and bloodier with gift suggestions for the horror and paranormal fans in your life. Comic books, action figures, statues, graphic novels, swanky shirts and hats, paranormal investigation equipment, and even some vodka and cologne are all included, and all part of the theme."

(WKRC) -\n\nWhile the physical structure is being dismantled, the fate of the supernatural entities that allegedly haunted the venue for decades remains a mystery. Laura Roland, who runs and has offered tours detailing the haunted history of Bobby Mackey's for 10 years, shared her insights on the paranormal activity associated with the site.\n\n\"Everything from shadowy figures, full-bodied apparitions. We hear voices either just with our ears or on a recorder. Pretty much everything has happened here at Mackey's. People have been scratched, touched, pushed,\" Roland said.\n\nRoland explained that because paranormal study isn't an exact science, the future of the spirits is uncertain.\n\n\"Many people think that the spirits are attached to the land and that whatever is built on this property, the spirits will still be here,\" said Roland.\n\nIf the spirits are indeed tied to the land, they may linger around whatever is constructed on the site. However, Roland noted another possibility: the supernatural specters might be connected to the building or its contents, in which case they would dissipate and move on.\n\n\"I definitely think that there were spirits that were attached to the building. Like I said, the man that was killed. But also, I think there could be some that are attached to the land. And Bobby does plan to rebuild a new club on the spot. So there's a very good chance that that new club will be haunted as well,\" Roland said.\n\nBobby Mackey's has temporarily relocated to the old Mugbee's location in Florence, with plans to open a new building and club on the original site by 2026.\n\nThe mystery of Bobby Mackey's continues to captivate those intrigued by the paranormal, leaving many to wonder if the apparitions and specters will continue to haunt the property."

            "article_content": "It may not have won \u201cWord of the Year,\u201d but romantasy is still the reigning champion of many readers' hearts.\n\nAlex Belanger shares her romantasy recommendations with more than 16,000 followers on TikTok. Because the 31-year-old Kentuckian grew up in a sheltered religious sect, she's always been drawn to \u201cRapunzel\u201d stories. Fairytales about broadening worldviews and unexplored places were a childhood comfort. During the pandemic, she stumbled into romantasy books on TikTok, and found they both reminded her of her youth and reflected her interests as an adult.\n\nBelanger is just one of the many readers steering one of publishing's prized horses \u2013 the genre's sales increased 42% from 2022 to 2023, according to Circana.\n\nWhat is romantasy?\n\nA portmanteau of the words \u201cromance\u201d and \u201cfantasy,\u201d romantasy blends two beloved genres. Readers get all the best parts of swoony love story tropes, magical world-building and high-stakes adventure.\n\nCheck out: USA TODAY's weekly Best-selling Booklist\n\nMany romantasy books include fae or fairies, dragons, elves and other mythical creatures. Popular series \u201cA Court of Thorns and Roses\u201d by Sarah J. Maas is a \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d retelling set in a divided realm of humans and faeries. \u201cFourth Wing\u201d by Rebecca Yarros, another romantasy favorite, follows a young girl training to become a dragon rider.\n\nThe world-building is more expansive than many other romance subgenres. In paranormal romance, for example, magical characters often appear in normal society rather than in an entirely new, imagined land.\n\nBut the two genres often overlap, especially with their readership. Ali Hazelwood\u2019s \u201cBride,\u201d which features a romance between a vampire and werewolf, was a recent hit with romantasy fans.\n\n\u201cThe blurring of these lines is just exciting and expansive and allows authors and publishers to have a greater diversification of contents, of character,\u201d says Ashley Doliber, the senior director of marketing strategy at Entangled Publishing, which houses such series as Rebecca Yarros' \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Obsidian\" by Jennifer L. Armentrout. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to color within certain lines, you have the opportunity to really push those boundaries.\u201d\n\nIs romantasy the right genre for you?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a fantasy fanatic to get in on the fun. Many readers credit romantasy series like \u201cACOTAR\u201d as the reason they got back into reading, even if they were initially hesitant to try the genre. And despite their length, they tend to be fast-paced, immersive reads.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to choose from, which keeps the genre fresh, says Belanger. She recommends switching up the tropes and types of mythical beings in your books. Worlds inhabited by fairies or dragons are among the most popular, but she's recently seen an uptick in \u201cshifter\u201d protagonists, who, as the name suggests, can morph between human and animal forms.\n\nRomantasy is also the perfect genre for those who grew up reading fan fiction.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to find a lot of the people that write romantasy are the people that wrote fan fiction in the past,\u201d Belanger says.\n\nJulie Soto, author of \u201cRose in Chains,\u201d used to write \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fan fiction. Hazelwood\u2019s \u201cThe Love Hypothesis\u201d was originally published online as \u201cReylo\u201d fan fiction (yes \u2013 as in Rey and Kylo Ren from \u201cStar Wars\u201d).\n\nMore than just \u2018spicy\u2019: Readers find romantasy empowering\n\nThere\u2019s something so unputdownable about stepping into a magical world and finding your OTP (one true pairing).\n\nSteamy romance novels are sometimes seen as the fluff of the literary world. Society has long been quick to invalidate female sexuality and empowerment as \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d reads.\n\n\u201cThat escapism aspect is certainly key,\u201d Doliber says. \u201cBut I think what a lot of genre fiction allows is the opportunity to simultaneously have that fun, joyful, thought-provoking escapism (and) at the same time, you\u2019re tackling real-world themes\u201d like female empowerment and agency.\n\nIt\u2019s also one corner of the internet where readers have been able to embrace their sexuality and center female pleasure. Some readers told HuffPost that romance books and erotica have helped improve their sex lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really great way to help your mind become open and break away from purity culture,\u201d Belanger says. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in a woman\u2019s pleasure and knowing what you want.\u201d\n\nBest romantasy books\n\nRomantasy may be buzzy, but it\u2019s not a new genre. Belanger cites \"foundational\" romantasy reads (which, in the 2010s, were more medieval than fae) like Mary E. Pearson\u2019s \u201cThe Remnant Chronicles\u201d and Marissa Meyer\u2019s fairytale retellings in \u201cThe Lunar Chronicles.\u201d\n\nModern classics include Sarah J. Maas' three bestselling romantasy series \"A Court of Thorns and Roses,\" \"Throne of Glass\" and \"Crescent City.\" Rebecca Yarros is another big name in romantasy with \"Fourth Wing,\" \"Iron Flame\" and her upcoming \"Onyx Storm,\" which releases in January.\n\nIf you want to dive into the romantasy genre, here are the titles Belanger suggests starting with:\n\n\u201cA River Enchanted\u201d by Rebecca Ross\n\n\u201cHouse of Dragons\u201d by K.A. Linde\n\n\u201cSong of the Forever Rains\u201d by E.J. Mellow\n\n\u201cA Court this Cruel and Lovely\u201d by Stacia Stark\n\n\u201cFor the Wolf\u201d by Hannah Whitten\n\n\u201cThe Bridge Kingdom\u201d by Danielle L. Jensen\n\n\u201cLedge\u201d by Stacey McEwan\n\n\u201cQuicksilver\u201d by Callie Hart\n\n\u201cFeather\u201d by Olivia Wildenstein\n\n\u201cThrone in the Dark\u201d by A.K. Caggiano\n\n\u201cA Fate Inked in Blood\u201d by Danielle L. Jensen\n\n\u201cBelladonna\u201d by Adalyn Grace (YA)\n\n\u201cSinner\u2019s Isle\u201d by Angela Montoya (YA)\n\n\u201cAn Enchantment of Ravens\u201d by Margaret Rogerson (YA)\n\n\u201cA Curse So Dark and Lonely\u201d by Brigid Kemmerer (YA)\n\n\u201cThe Shadows Between Us\u201d by Tricia Levenseller (YA)\n\n\u201cImmortal Dark\u201d by Tigest Girma (YA)\n\nAnd here are some favorites from USA TODAY staff:\n\n\u201cFrom Blood and Ash\u201d Jennifer L. Armentrout\n\n\u201cThese Hollow Vows\u201d Lexi Ryan\n\n\u201cHouse of Beating Wings\u201d Olivia Wildenstein\n\n\u201cThe Serpent and the Wings of Night\u201d Carissa Broadbent\n\n\u201cDivine Rivals\u201d Rebecca Ross\n\n\u201cSpark of the Everflame\u201d Penn Cole\n\nNot the right fit for you? Try these other genres:\n\nCozy mystery books have octogenarian protagonists and combine crime with comfort. Paranormal romances deal in otherworldly love (literally). And cozy fantasy books have all the loveable characters with less of the blood-pressure-raising stakes. Still not it?

            "article_content": "Charming and ebullient, Ducotterd does not fit the stereotype of a research scientist. She grew up in Wigan, and her accent has survived long years abroad. Like many involved in dementia research, she has a personal connection to the disease. With a dentist father and social worker mother, Ducotterd initially planned to become a vet, but when she didn\u2019t get into veterinary school she studied biology at the University of Edinburgh instead. Around the same time, her grandmother\u2019s mental state began to decline.\n\n\u201cI was watching my granny start to buy food for people who didn\u2019t live with her anymore and forget big details about her life,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving that personal connection to the story made me so motivated by what I was doing in the lab. I thought: this is exactly what I want to do. Make medicines.\u201d She went on to a PhD at Newcastle. In the face of diminished neuroscience investment in the UK, she moved to Japan for a postdoctoral position studying Parkinson\u2019s disease. Later she worked at GSK in China and later at Eisai Pharmaceuticals in the USA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an amazingly global experience of drug discovery,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to be innovative you have to think differently. And the more different ways of thinking you have in your group, the more you\u2019re going to challenge each other.\u201d\n\nShe ended up staying in America for nine years, before moving back to the UK at the end of 2022, by which time she had acquired a husband and a daughter. While she had been away, Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK had taken the lead in establishing new Drug Discovery Institutes at Oxford, Cambridge and in London, enabling them to function like biotech startups in a university setting, adding free-market pep to academic excellence.\n\nSince Ducotterd was an undergraduate, there has been revolutionary progress in neurodegenerative diseases, mostly driven by advances in computing.\n\n\u201cI went to university just after they\u2019d cloned Dolly the sheep,\u201d she says. \u201cThe molecular technologies have transformed the field \u2013 being able to sequence genomes in minutes rather than years; methods that let us do more rapid analysis of big data; artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u201d\n\nThe success of lecanemab, a drug that has been shown to slow Alzheimer\u2019s progression by 30 per cent in early-stage patients (but which has yet to be approved on the NHS) has also energised the field by showing that progress is possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019ve never seen a trial that has shown we can slow the disease at all. It gives massive amounts of hope and investment because everyone now knows it is possible.\u201d\n\nOne of the projects she is particularly excited about involves leveraging human genetics to mimic natural resilience against dementia. \u201cThere is a really interesting study in a group in Holland where they\u2019re looking at people who live healthily into their hundreds cognitively,\u201d she says."

For instance, ChatGPT Plus currently charges $20 per month with reports from Bloomberg suggesting this could double in the coming years. OpenAI\u2019s $200 per month plan further illustrates the industry\u2019s upward pricing trajectory.

If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\n\nA former OpenAI employee and whistleblower, Suchir Balaji, was recently found dead in his apartment in San Francisco, California.\n\nThe San Francisco Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has identified Balaji, 26, as the deceased person, according to the San Jose Mercury News. The manner of death has been ruled suicide.\n\nThe medical examiner said it had notified Balaji's family.\n\nLisa Kudrow Began To Fear Ai After Seeing Tom Hanks Movie\n\nThe OpenAI ChatGPT logo is seen on a mobile phone in this photo illustration on May 30, 2023, in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nBalaji was found dead in his Buchanan Street apartment on November 26, a spokesperson for the San Francisco Police Department told the outlet. First responders were called to his home to perform a wellness check, and no evidence of foul play was found during the initial probe.\n\nRead On The Fox News App\n\n\"We are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news today and our hearts go out to Suchir\u2019s loved ones during this difficult time,\" a spokesperson for OpenAI told Fox News Digital.\n\nThis comes after Balaji, an AI researcher, raised concerns about OpenAI breaking copyright law in an interview with The New York Times in October.\n\nA man is seen using the OpenAI ChatGPT artificial intelligence chat website in this illustration photo on July 18, 2023.\n\nBalaji resigned from OpenAI after working there for nearly four years when he learned the technology would bring more harm than good to society, he told the newspaper, noting that his main concern was the way the company allegedly used copyright data, stating that he believed its practices were damaging to the internet.\n\n\"I was at OpenAI for nearly 4 years and worked on ChatGPT for the last 1.5 of them,\" Balaji wrote in October on the social media platform X. \"I initially didn't know much about copyright, fair use, etc. but became curious after seeing all the lawsuits filed against GenAI companies.\"\n\nWhat Is Artificial Intelligence (Ai)?\n\nThe OpenAI logo is arranged on a laptop in Beijing, China, on Friday, Feb. 24, 2023.\n\n\"When I tried to understand the issue better, I eventually came to the conclusion that fair use seems like a pretty implausible defense for a lot of generative AI products, for the basic reason that they can create substitutes that compete with the data they\u2019re trained on,\" his post continued.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft are currently facing several lawsuits from media outlets who accuse OpenAI of breaking copyright law.\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to the medical examiner and San Francisco Police.\n\nFox News' Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal article source: OpenAI whistleblower found dead in San Francisco apartment from apparent suicide"

            "article_content": "YouTube has had quite a monumental year in terms of user engagement, logging in over a billion hours of content streamed daily on TV sets alone. However, the platform is also home to a sea of content that isn\u2019t safe for children, which is why a dedicated \u201ckids\u201d experience has been there for a while.\n\nNow, YouTube is adding a password protocol that will keep young users from accessing any other profile, apart from their designated \u201ckids\u201d profile on a TV. In a community update, the company introduced the new Parent Code feature that will block kids from accessing user profiles for adults in their household.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIt is an opt-in feature that needs to be enabled manually. Once activated, this code will be required if kids want to access a profile meant for other members of their family. Moreover, they will also be prompted to enter the code if they want to access the video platform without any Google account signed in.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to view this content\n\nGoing a step further, the team will also require the parent code if an individual attempts to remove an account from the shared TV. YouTube has also clarified that enabling the new feature won\u2019t affect other devices on which the same account is being used.\n\nIn order to enable the Parent code feature, just follow this path:\n\nIn the YouTube app installed on your TV, navigate to the Settings page. You will see a dedicated Parent Code tab in the Settings dashboard. Go through the on-screen prompts and set up the four-digit Parent Code. In order to disable the safety feature, you need to enter the same code in the future.\n\nDo keep in mind that once you remove the parent code, anyone can enjoy YouTube sans any age restrictions for content, and without having to sign up with a Google account. Moreover, all user profiles belonging to adult members will be openly accessible.\n\nThe latest safety-focused feature update from YouTube is actually a corrective measure on the company\u2019s end. Earlier this year, Google pulled away the separate YouTube Kids app icon in the YouTube experience for TVs and smart devices.\n\nInstead, the profiles for Kids and adults were all clubbed together under the \u201cWho\u2019s watching\u201d launch banner. \u201cNow, you can easily select your child\u2019s profile from within the YouTube app, and you\u2019ll be brought right into the new YouTube Kids experience on TV,\u201d the company reasoned back then.\n\nHowever, it seems that not all parents and guardians were happy with the move, apparently because it makes it far easier for kids to access other user profiles that show content without any age restrictions. Locking non-kids profiles behind a passcode is a step in the right direction.\n\nThe Parent Code feature on YouTube is now rolling out and will start appearing for all users within the next few days."

Here\u2019s how to submit a claim.\n\nVERIFY often fact-checks settlement notices so our readers know whether they are legitimate or fraudulent.\n\nSome people, including a VERIFY journalist, received emails in December notifying them about a ParkMobile class action settlement due to a data breach. ParkMobile is a mobile parking payment app that is used in many U.S. states.\n\nGoogle Trends data show many people online are wondering if the ParkMobile data breach settlement is legitimate.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nIs the ParkMobile data breach settlement real?\n\nTHE SOURCES\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nYes, the ParkMobile data breach settlement is real.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nParkMobile customers who were notified about the parking app\u2019s 2021 data breach could receive up to $25 as part of a proposed class action settlement.\n\nThe parking payment app company agreed to a $32.8 million settlement following a 2021 lawsuit alleging it failed to protect people\u2019s personal information, court records show. ParkMobile denied any wrongdoing or liability, an official settlement website says.\n\nParkMobile also acknowledged the settlement and linked out to the official website on Dec. 5.\n\nA class action lawsuit was filed in Georgia about two months after ParkMobile confirmed a \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d linked to a third-party software in March 2021. The lawsuit alleges that about 21 million users\u2019 personal information was compromised in the data breach.\n\nAccording to ParkMobile, the leaked information included license plate numbers, email addresses, phone numbers and mailing addresses, as well as encrypted passwords but not the encryption keys required to read them. Users\u2019 credit card numbers were not leaked, the company said.\n\nWho qualifies for the settlement\n\nAnyone who received a notice from ParkMobile about the 2021 data security incident is eligible to submit a claim, according to the official website. People who are eligible also should have received an emailed notice about the class action settlement.\n\nIf you are still unsure about whether you\u2019re eligible for the settlement, you can contact the Settlement Administrator at 1-866-944-4062.\n\nAccording to the official website, $9 million of the proposed settlement has been set aside for cash payments to people affected by the data breach. The amount of money each person can receive is capped at $25, the website says.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t submit claims for cash payments will receive $1 credits from ParkMobile via email.\n\nHow to submit a claim\n\nPeople who are eligible for the settlement must submit a claim by Wednesday, March 5, 2025, the settlement website says.\n\nYou can submit a claim online using the ID and confirmation code on your mailed or emailed notice. If you don\u2019t have the notice ID and confirmation code, you can look up your login by entering your name and email address.\n\nYou can also print out a claim form here and mail it postmarked no later than March 5 to this address: ParkMobile Data Security Incident, Attn: Claim Forms, 1650 Arch Street, Suite 2210, Philadelphia, PA 19103.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly when people who are eligible for the settlement could receive their payments."

            "article_content": "In 2024, researchers turned up possible evidence of ancient life on Mars, hints that Alzheimer\u2019s disease can spread from person-to-person and a slew of other scientific findings that could be a big deal \u2014 if they\u2019re the real deal.\n\nMartian microbes, maybe\n\nAlien microbes may have once made their home on Mars (SN: 8/24/24, p. 6). In July, NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover uncovered a rock on the Red Planet that sports white spots with black rings laced with iron phosphate (see Page 28). On Earth, such specks have been linked to ancient micro\u00adbial life. But they\u2019re not surefire signs of microbes. The only way to know for certain is to bring the rock back to Earth for closer inspection.\n\nNASA\u2019s Perseverance rover discovered leopard spot\u2013like features in this Martian rock (closeup image shown). On Earth, similar structures are associated with microbial life. MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASA\n\nSparking superconductivity\n\nLight may be the secret ingredient for making superconductors that don\u2019t require frigid conditions. In an experiment, blasting a copper and oxygen compound with a laser caused the material to throw off magnetic fields. That magnetism, the scientists say, is a smoking gun for superconductivity \u2014 the ability to ferry electricity with no resistance (SN: 8/10/24, p. 6). But skeptics contend that those magnetic fields might have arisen from some other, unknown physics.\n\nIn experiments, a compound made of copper and oxygen atoms (blue and red spheres in this illustration) blasted with laser light (red) threw off magnetic fields (blue). This effect signals that the compound transformed into a superconductor, some physicists say. Sebastian Fava, J\u00f6rg M. Harms\n\nAncient engineering\n\nBuilders used a water-powered elevator to construct Egypt\u2019s first pyramid nearly 4,700 years ago, researchers propose (SN: 9/7/24 & 9/21/24, p. 11). That controversial idea is based on a computer model of structures in and around the Step Pyramid of Djoser. Controlling the flow of floodwater in and out of a shaft inside the pyramid could have lifted and lowered a block-hoisting platform, the model shows. But critics argue that occasional rains wouldn\u2019t have supplied enough water to sustain such a system.\n\nAncient workers could have built Egyptian King Djoser\u2019s pyramid (shown) using a water-powered elevator to hoist the heavy stone blocks, a computer simulation suggests. But not all archaeologists are on board with the idea. Anton Petrus/Moment/Getty Images\n\nTectonic shake-up\n\nPlate tectonics got off to an early start in Earth\u2019s history, a rock in South Africa suggests. Layers in the rock bear scars of 3-billion-year-old landslides that may have been caused by an earthquake (SN: 4/6/24, p. 6). That quake, scientists say, could have been triggered by slabs of crust colliding. The finding lends support to the contested idea that plate tectonics dates back more than 2.8 billion years. But other geologists are not convinced that this quake marks the start of global plate tectonics.\n\nLayers of rock at the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa contain hints of a huge earthquake triggered by plate tectonics more than 3 billion years ago. Simon Lamb\n\nMedium size, maximum hype\n\nFor the first time, astronomers may have spotted a midsize black hole in our galaxy (SN: 8/10/24, p. 7). Telescope data suggest that a black hole at least 8,200 times as massive as the sun lurks in the star cluster Omega Centauri. But another study disputes the claim. Instead, the star cluster could harbor a horde of smaller black holes (SN: 8/20/24).\n\nIf a rare midsize black hole truly does lurk in the heart of the Omega Centauri star cluster, it would be the first black hole of its size found in the Milky Way. In this Hubble Space Telescope image, the supposed black hole\u2019s location is marked by the white box. Hubble/ESA, NASA, M. H\u00e4berle/MPIA\n\nTransmissible Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is not contagious in everyday life, but under extremely rare conditions, it may spread from one person to another (SN: 2/24/24, p. 6). Five people who in childhood received contaminated growth hormone injections later developed early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 most likely because the hormones were tainted with amyloid-beta, a protein whose buildup is linked to the disease, researchers say. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether the growth hormones are to blame, other experts note. Perhaps the health conditions that those hormones were meant to treat or other medical procedures led to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s in these patients.\n\nHigh levels of the protein amyloid-beta \u2014 a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 appear orange and purple in this brain scan of a man with the disease. Childhood exposure to the protein via contaminated growth hormone injections may have led the man to develop Alzheimer\u2019s later in life. G. Banerjee et al/Nature Medicine 2024\n\nShedding light on dark energy\n\nDark energy may have gotten even more mysterious. The enigmatic stuff, which makes up the bulk of the cosmos, is generally thought to maintain a constant density. But new observations of 6.4 million galaxies and quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, or DESI, paired with data on exploding stars, cast doubt on that idea. These data more closely fit a model of the universe in which the relationship between dark energy\u2019s density and its pressure changes over time (SN: 5/4/24 & 5/18/24, p. 6). If confirmed, this finding would rewrite the history of the universe. Experts are withholding judgment until DESI completes its survey of over 30 million other galaxies (SN: 12/14/24 & 12/28/24, p. 7)."

            "article_content": "Standing Up for Science with Science Communication\n\nURBANA, Illinois, US, Dec 13 2024 (IPS) - New research shows that AI-generated summaries of scientific writing made the information more approachable and easier to understand, and thus created more public engagement with the information. This is notable because most scientists aren\u2019t trained in science communication tactics and so their jargon affects many people\u2019s ability to understand and trust scientific papers and findings.\n\nScience communication has always been an important part of the scientific process because discoveries, solutions and findings that can help solve our world\u2019s greatest challenges cannot be adopted or understood by the public without clear communication. Communicating science well also can shape and inform public policy.\n\nScientists, therefore, have a responsibility to make sure that they communicate their knowledge and findings in a way that the public and policymakers can understand, but too often that is not happening.\n\nScientists have a responsibility to make sure that they communicate their knowledge and findings in a way that the public and policymakers can understand, but too often that is not happening\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the importance of science communication, it is necessary for scientists to be trained in science communication. That is why I started a science communications course at my university.\n\nI have taught it for over 4 years and cover topics like the art of writing opinion pieces and creating science stories, communicating science to different audiences through careful use of metaphors and minimal use of jargon.\n\nAdditionally, the class covers topics such as communicating science using social media and communicating with politicians and creating visual science stories. Students who have taken the class have continued to use the skills learned in class in their careers while others went on to become science communicators\n\nThe people who need to learn these skills include recent PhD graduates, post-doctoral fellows, assistant professors, newly tenured and full professors.\n\nThere are several resources including textbooks, science communication workshops, and many trusted organizations and institutions to which scientists can turn. Science communication newbies can also turn to social media including Bluesky social and Instagram to meet other science communication enthusiasts.\n\nNotably, there are institutions and organizations to which scientists can turn. The American Association for the Advancement of Science, for example has developed a communication toolkit to help science communication newbies.\n\nThe OpED project has programs to help people learn how to write OpEds and a few times a year, they offer science communication workshops. Moreover, most universities also have webpages listing science communication resources.\n\nFor example, Duke University has a webpage listing the resources available including science communication workshops, events and classes.\n\nCommunicating science effectively via OpEds, blogs, and social media outlets is not only important for reaching the public and policy makers, but it can help scientists themselves, too.\n\nFirst, through public publishing and engagement, scientists can establish their own reputation. Journalists and policymakers will often reach out to whatever expert they can easily find, and being active on social media and op-ed pages will make a person easier to find.\n\nBeing a consistent public voice \u2013 backed up by good work \u2013 can help establish someone as an expert in their field. Moreover, scientists that regularly and consistently participate in science communication can track its impact and include that on tenure promotion packages.\n\nThis happened to me. Being consistent with writing over 150 OpEds, since 2015, for example has helped to advance my career.\n\nSecond, communicating science publicly help a person build a professional network, which can lead to peers reaching out for collaborations and co-writing of grant proposals.\n\nIt can lead to people recommending each other for awards or invitations to speak on panels, workshops or to give plenary talks.\n\nThis has been my experience, and I\u2019ve received a few invitations thanks to my public writing. For instance, I was invited to give a plenary talk at the annual 2019 British Ecological Society, and I\u2019ve been invited to speak at various universities.\n\nIn 2021, I was awarded the American Association for the Advancement of Science Mani L. Bhaumik Award for Public Engagement with Science.\n\nThird, communicating science can help a scientist grow their skills and become better at speaking and writing in publicly accessible language. And it can help scientists learn to become better at capitalizing on newsworthy moments. In addition, this can also facilitate the building of trust among different communities and the public.\n\nFourth, it can allow scientists to offer a public service and provide accurate information about their discoveries and recent scientific and technological advancements to reporters and policymakers.\n\nOf course, for new beginners, it can be overwhelming to join the science communication bandwagon. Not only may it be unfamiliar and a new skill to develop, but there are concerns like being unable to control what happens to your writing or how it is used once it\u2019s published, or the fact that science is ever evolving, and new information may agree or disagree with previously held truths. But the benefits outweigh the negatives.\n\nScience communication is critical for conveying important scientific information. Scientists must stand up for science. When scientists become better science communicators, the public, society, and scientists benefit.\n\nEsther Ngumbi, PhD is Assistant Professor, Department of Entomology, African American Studies Department, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"

I reviewed F-Secure Total, an affordable antivirus solution that let me build a plan that covers all my devices with just the features I need.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhile we all like to keep an eye on the budget, computer security isn\u2019t the right place to cut corners. The best antivirus software provides excellent protection against online and offline malware at an affordable price.\n\nF-Secure has flexible pricing that you can customize to precisely match your needs. The most affordable plan starts at $50 annually, covering one device with real-time antivirus, scam, and ransomware protection in the browser and offline.\n\nYou probably use a computer, phone, and possibly several other devices. If one gets hacked, all of your social and financial accounts are at risk, as is the personal data stored on that device.\n\nIt makes sense to protect them all and F-Secure plans can cover 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, or more devices. A three-device plan starts at $65, five devices cost $70, and 10 computers, phones, and tablets is $85.\n\nThe options don\u2019t stop there. You can add a VPN with unlimited data for $10 more per year. A password manager and identity monitoring also adds $10 annually. With F-Secure, you pay only for what you need.\n\nStill, you can find better deals on antivirus software, at least for the first year of service. I do like that F-Secure doesn\u2019t have shocking price increases when it\u2019s time to renew.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a free solution, F-Secure has a free malware scan and removal tool. The website describes it as an online scanner, but it\u2019s actually a Windows app that installs on your PC before running.\n\nThe free scanner detects and clears malicious apps that are already active on your computer, but doesn\u2019t protect you from future threats. The best free antivirus software offers good browser protection without requiring a subscription.\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nF-Secure Total Platforms Windows, macOS, iOS, Android Devices Customizable (1-26) Support 24/7 Live Chat Free version? Windows malware scan and removal\n\nDesign\n\nI tested F-Secure Total, the version that includes antivirus, a VPN, identity monitoring, and more. After installing the app, the dashboard showed that real-time protection was active, but there were several other features to set up to maximize my cybersecurity.\n\nI installed the browser extension for online protection, the password manager extension to help secure account logins, and a VPN to prevent activity tracking, then added my email address for monitoring.\n\nWith setup complete, I explored the user interface. The dashboard shows all the active features at a glance and lets me select one to make adjustments. A button at the top left opens a menu with more options, including account details, settings, support, and quick access to all the features.\n\nI opened settings and found there are plenty of options to fine-tune each security feature, such as choosing which folders are locked to protect against ransomware.\n\nOverall, F-Secure Total was easy to get started with and the design is clear and simple, with advanced features accessible via settings.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe number one job of an antivirus is to protect my computer from malware. It should offer real-time detection and blocking to prevent infection. As a second line of defense, it should regularly scan for malicious apps and quarantine them so no harm is done.\n\nTo test how well F-Secure Total performed, I checked its score at full-time cybersecurity labs that continuously monitor the threat landscape and rate the effectiveness of leading antivirus software. F-Secure shows excellent AV-Test scores, falling below perfect only once with a minor miss in June 2023.\n\nF-Secure didn\u2019t fare well in AV-Comparatives scoring system, but a deeper dive into the real-time report reveals it blocked as many threats as antivirus leaders Norton, Avira, and McAfee, which have good protection track records.\n\nF-Secure\u2019s score dropped because it had a high false-positive rate, which includes incorrect app and website blocking. An overprotective antivirus can be annoying, but it isn\u2019t dangerous. In my tests, I didn\u2019t get any false alerts.\n\nI always do spot-checks by visiting Wicar\u2019s malware test website. F-Secure Total\u2019s browser extension successfully identified and blocked all 13 malware downloads and browser exploits.\n\nI tested the password manager and it autofilled logins as expected. It\u2019s not as sophisticated as the best password managers that allow organization and password sharing, but it handles the basics well and syncs across devices.\n\nF-Secure Total\u2019s VPN defaults to OpenVPN protocol, which isn\u2019t the fastest. I tried the only other option, IKEv2, which helped. Still, the best speed I measured was 20% as fast as my usual 900 Mbps. With the best dedicated VPN services, I enjoy over 700 Mbps downloads.\n\nSupport\n\nF-Secure claims it offers 24/7 support via live chat, so I tested that out by asking about login sharing. A live agent answered immediately and continued to respond quickly as I clarified my question.\n\nI\u2019ve reviewed several antivirus services and found that live chat support varies. Solutions like ESET have good support, but during limited hours. Others use chat services that start off quickly, then slow dramatically after the first response. I also verified that live chat with a human is available for F-Secure customers all day, every day.\n\nAs I mentioned above, there\u2019s no password sharing option in F-Secure, but the agent suggested I could copy and send the password via a message, email, or written on paper. I liked the inclusion of an offline solution from tech support.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nF-Secure\u2019s privacy policy is very clear and states that it won\u2019t sell or share your personal data to third-party advertisers. It will comply with legal requests, but it doesn\u2019t allow backdoors in its software. The company is based in Finland, which isn\u2019t part of any intelligence alliances for information sharing.\n\nI couldn\u2019t find any record of customer data breaches or cybersecurity incidents, so your personal and financial information should be secure when using F-Secure Total antivirus protection.\n\nIs F-Secure right for you?\n\nThe least inexpensive option, F-Secure Internet Security, offers good protection, but doesn\u2019t beat the best antivirus software. While the VPN and password manager are nice additions to F-Secure Total, dedicated services offer more advanced features.\n\nThe best password managers aren\u2019t that expensive, and you can even find excellent free password managers. The same is true of VPNs. Proton offers a great free VPN], and you can often find VPN deals that minimize your cost without sacrificing speed.\n\nWhile F-Secure Total\u2019s high false positive score is a drawback, I didn\u2019t have any problems with apps or websites being blocked. Also, a false positive is better than allowing malware to run wild on your computer.\n\nThat said, antivirus software like Bitdefender and Norton provide solid protection without the annoyance of overzealous blocking. However, I liked F-Secure Total\u2019s customizable subscription plans and consistent pricing on renewal and still recommend it as a good solution if you want to fine-tune your subscription to exactly what you need."

            "article_content": "Visibility has reached virtually zero as the snow squall rips over the car. The two German engineers shuttling us for a ride in an all-electric prototype of the coming 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class are now talking in somewhat strained tones as more German crackles in over the walkie. We\u2019re backing up slowly as the CLA\u2019s front and rear motors spin all four wheels.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why the road we\u2019re on, the Timmelsjoch Hochalpenstra\u00dfe, a mountain pass that zigzags through the Alps between Austria and Italy and crests at more than 8,200 feet, is closed this time of year. But that\u2019s also the reason why Mercedes decided to hold an event here and get the road open in the first place, so it could highlight how well its 4Matic-equipped cars like the new CLA can handle snowbound road conditions. This was a little bit dicier than Mercedes expected, however.\n\nAfter the conditions calm down some, we\u2019re finally able to rejoin the convoy at the summit on the Italian border where the angular concrete pillbox that is the Timmelsjoch Experience Pass Museum looms over the proceedings, jutting out from the rockface and surveying a breathtakingly dramatic view of the Italian Alps. It\u2019s all been a bit surreal.\n\nFirst Frigid Glances Look Positive\n\nOn the way back, with things more settled weather-wise, we get a chance to ponder the 2026 CLA prototype we\u2019re riding in. This is one of the dual-motor cars, which makes it a 4Matic model in the new-age EV sense. (It will be available in rear-motor EV and hybrid-powered versions, as well.) It employs a 268-hp permanent-magnet motor at the rear supplemented by a 107-hp permanent-magnet motor up front. A two-speed transmission is integrated into the rear drive unit, another efficiency play that makes sense in today\u2019s environment where every mile of range is precious. The front motor's single-speed transmission employs an axle disconnect to further improve efficiency during highway cruising.\n\nMaximizing efficiency was an overarching focus of the new CLA\u2019s development, and Axel Heix, our ace driver and director of development for Mercedes-Benz passenger cars, made sure to call it out when talking about the CLA\u2019s body shape. From what we experienced up close and from the inside, the new car should retain much of the present car\u2019s sloping greenhouse feel, which has been a calling card since its debut. It was already an efficient car from a drag, or lack thereof, perspective, and it will no doubt be even more so for the new model. Mercedes is also claiming the CLA will be 93 percent efficient from the battery to the wheel while driving over long distances.\n\nFrom what we briefly experienced in the back and front passenger seat of the 2026 CLA, this is still a compact car inside, but given its all-new Mercedes Modular Architecture (MMA) and packaging, this 6-footer had no problem with leg- or headroom in the rear of the car, and that was with this car\u2019s glass roof that extended over the greenhouse. Up front, there was more than ample room in the passenger area, as well. The materials of the door panels and armrests that weren\u2019t covered in camouflage featured several soft-touch areas, with a decidedly upscale look reminiscent of today\u2019s higher-end Mercedes models; the seating itself seemed top notch in feel and execution. Although this is the cheapest car in the automaker\u2019s U.S. lineup at present, the new one it won\u2019t be the cheapest-looking or cheapest-feeling from what we experienced.\n\nAbout that packaging. As outlined, the 2026 CLA will be the first Mercedes to roll on the automaker\u2019s new MMA setup, which has been configured to accommodate 800-volt charging. We\u2019re told the car\u2019s 85-kWh battery pack (the only one we\u2019ll get in U.S. models) should charge at up to 320 kW, among the highest power in the industry. (We\u2019ve previously outlined all the ins and outs of the battery and the powertrain. You can read about that here .) The headlines are that we\u2019re estimating the CLA\u2019s overall range should be 350 miles or so to a full charge, with 10 minutes of DC fast charging gaining some 140 miles of range or more, which would make it one of the quickest-charging cars we\u2019ve tested to date. For its part, Mercedes claims the pack can be charged from 10 to 80 percent in less than 22 minutes.\n\nAbout that Charging\n\nSounds great, right? This is where things get a bit choppy. The battery\u2019s 320-kW charging capability is tremendous, and it will be one of only a few cars on the road with that ability when it launches late next year. One potential issue as we see it, though, is with the 2026 CLA\u2019s dual-port charger setup, which has a J1772 plug (the connector that many EV owners have in their garages) for Level 2 AC charging and a NACS plug (the Tesla-designed connector that every automaker is now scrambling to use in the future) for DC fast charging. On the surface, this also sounds good, and for its part, Mercedes sees this, like its 800-volt ability, as another way to help future-proof the CLA. Here\u2019s what it had to say about the setup:\n\n\u201cThe current AC charging infrastructure predominantly utilizes J1772 connectors. By offering both ports, Mercedes-Benz accommodates the existing infrastructure while positioning itself for a future transition to NACS as it becomes more widely adopted. The dual-port configuration in the CLA EV reflects Mercedes-Benz's commitment to providing flexible and user-friendly charging solutions, ensuring compatibility with existing infrastructure while preparing for future advancements in charging standards.\u201d\n\nThe problem is the present. Of the 17,000 or so Tesla Superchargers in the U.S. to date, exactly zero of them are 800-volt units so far. CLA owners who plug into a 400-volt Supercharger will find that their cars only charge at 100 kW rather than the maximum 320 kW. At the moment, the number of 800-volt DC chargers with NACS ports is extremely small\u2014you'll mostly find them on the EVgo network. Electrify America\u2019s chargers are also capable of charging 800-volt vehicles at full power, but those units almost all use the CCS connector (the other DC fast-charging plug that\u2019s eventually going away) . CLA owners will have to carry CCS-to-NACS adapters for the first few years if they want to enjoy the benefits of the MMA platform\u2019s powerful charging capability.\n\nOne of the chief advantages of the slim NACS connector is that it supports AC and DC charging on the same connector pins. But, inexplicably, Mercedes\u2019 NACS port won\u2019t support the AC side of the equation. Plug a Tesla home charger or one of the 40,000 Tesla Destination chargers into the CLA\u2019s NACS port, and the Mercedes just won\u2019t charge.\n\nThe idea of putting two ports on one car sounds like the best of both worlds, but Mercedes has managed to configure the CLA in the most confusing way possible. It seems like somewhere in development a decision was made to do both ports. Maybe things were already too far along, maybe it was easier/more cost effective, but it seems as though the true future-proofing choice would have been to commit to NACS for both AC and DC charging. We get it, though; it\u2019s Monday morning quarterbacking at this point, and it won\u2019t be the end of the world for most owners.\n\nSome Software Revisions Left\n\nThose issues aside, and they are relatively minor in the grand scheme, especially if technology advances quickly, the automaker\u2019s new MMA platform alone is a huge leap forward for the brand, and as a whole the 2026 CLA on paper looks to be a technological tour de force, with dramatically upgraded software being a part of it. At the summit, we asked Heix what was still left to do or further tune before launch. He expressed confidence in the mechanicals of the car and the powertrain. His only real callout was software, which he said was last in line to fine tune by design.\n\nAccording to Heix, the CLA will be using a new iteration of the automaker\u2019s MB.OS software suite of tools. From the brief glimpses of the infotainment screen that we noticed under the flap of camo draping over it, it looks to be a significantly different setup than what\u2019s in present Mercedes models from an interface perspective, and there\u2019s still more than a little development work to do from the sound of it. Just as important, as the world continues to move toward software-defined vehicles, the CLA is also serving as the vanguard of the automaker\u2019s latest efforts in those crucial areas, such as enhanced over-the-air updates.\n\nOur brief snowbound look at the new 2026 Mercedes CLA only further whets our appetite for the final product. We\u2019ll know much more about it sometime early next year when additional details and uncamouflaged photos are revealed, with Mercedes expected to launch the car for sale here late in 2025."

            "article_content": "The lawsuit between Elon Musk and OpenAI is really heating up.\n\nOpenAI just dropped a new blog post defending itself against Musk that outlines some new text messages between cofounders Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and former board member Shivon Zilis.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sue your way to AGI,\u201d the OpenAI blog post reads, referring to artificial general intelligence, which Altman has promised soon. \u201cWe have great respect for Elon\u2019s accomplishments and gratitude for his early contributions to OpenAl, but he should be competing in the marketplace rather than the courtroom. It is critical for the U.S. to remain the global leader in Al. Our mission is to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity, and we have been and will remain a mission-driven organization. We hope Elon shares that goal, and will uphold the values of innovation and free market competition that have driven his own success.\u201d\n\nSome of the new messages revealed show Brockman telling Zilis in July 2017 about a meeting he had with Musk, who allegedly said that a non-profit was definitely the right structure early on but \u201cmay not be the right one now.\u201d Later that month, Brockman wrote to Musk that path for OpenAI should be: \u201c1. AI research non-profit (through end of 2017) 2. AI research + hardware for-profit (starting 2018) 3. Government project (when: ??).\u201d\n\nThe blog also highlights Musk\u2019s attempts to maneuver into the CEO position and gain majority control of the company (though it adds that on one call Musk said he \u201cdidn\u2019t care about equity\u201d but \u201cjust needed to accumulate $80B for a city on Mars\u201d). Musk also proposed that OpenAI spin into Tesla, which has been previously revealed. When the negotiations fell apart because OpenAI\u2019s cofounders rejected his proposal (Brockman and Sutskever admitted they had fears of a power struggle), Musk resigned from the company.\n\nThe blog said that after Musk resigned, he hosted a goodbye all-hands with the team where he encouraged them to \u201cpursue the path we saw to raising billions per year\u201d and that \u201che would pursue advanced Al research at Tesla, which was the only vehicle he believed could obtain this level of funding.\u201d\n\nLater, around the time Musk was working to acquire Twitter, he texted Altman that he was \u201cdisturbed\u201d to see the company\u2019s new $20 billion valuation. \u201cDe facto. I provided almost all the seed, A and most of B round funding,\u201d he wrote, according to the disclosed texts. \u201cThis is a bait and switch.\u201d\n\nA few months after that interaction, Musk started an OpenAI competitor, xAI.\n\nSome of the messages published by OpenAI were previously outlined in court filings that Musk made in his ongoing suit against OpenAI and its partner Microsoft. The lawsuit, filed by Musk in March, alleges that OpenAI had strayed from its original nonprofit mission to develop AI for the public good (he withdrew it in June 2024 without explanation, then refiled in August 2024)."

            "article_content": "Consumer sentiment and spending will remain strong in 2025, Goldman Sachs says.\n\nAnalysts expect discretionary cash flow for US consumers to grow 5.2% compared to a 4.4% rise in 2024.\n\nThat strength will lead to outsize gains among discretionary stocks, with some outperformance in staples, too, they say.\n\nConsumer spending will be solid again next year, boosting stocks in discretionary sectors as well as consumer staples, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe firm expects discretionary cash flow for US consumers to pick up in 2025, growing 5.2% compared to a 4.4% rise in 2024, helped by more reasonable inflation levels and falling interest rates.\n\nMore robust cash flows will support a healthy discretionary spending backdrop and higher savings for US consumers, though disposable income will grow slightly slower than in 2024, down to 4.9% from 5.8%, though still robust given historical levels, the firm says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Aggregate household balance sheets remain robust, with net worth to DPI and household home equity as a share of GDP near all-time highs, which along with encouraging signs in consumer confidence should support a resilient spending backdrop despite supporting a modestly higher savings rate for 2025,\" the analysts said.\n\nThe analysts added that there are signs of improving consumer sentiment more generally. The firms' 2024 holiday survey found that lower-income consumers plan to spend more this year, while perceptions of prices and the importance of promotions moderated from last year.\n\nGiven the sustained healthy outlook for consumers, a few corners of the stock market are poised for strong gains, the analysts said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe firm sees the most upside for discretionary stocks, adding that the sector will likely continue to outperform the more defensive consumer staples sector as bullishness continues to soar. However, consumer staples will also enjoy some tailwinds going into 2025.\n\n\"We saw a rotation away from Staples (given its defensive nature) to Discretionary over the last few months as the market's assessment of recession risk fell,\" the analysts said, adding, \"We expect this to continue in 2025 as well.\"\n\nThe analysts said discretionary stocks are poised for growth amid easing interest rates and as their share of consumers' wallets normalizes, particularly among stocks like Target, Bath & Body Works, and DICK'S Sporting Goods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey added that shares of consumer sector companies like Walmart, with healthy supply chain investments and long-term drivers like growth in alternative revenue streams, will continue to outperform. The retailer's stock is up around 78% in 2024.\n\nThose names seeing greater competition and higher risks related to tariffs, though, will likely see a tougher environment in 2025, the bank said, pointing to companies including Autozone and RH (formerly Restoration Hardware).\n\nThe analysts said defensive sectors like consumer staples also have an improving setup as consumer sentiment rises. The sector saw inflows toward the end of the summer as recession fears spiked, but it has since seen losses amid stronger bullish sentiment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We see emerging tailwinds as volume/mix continues to improve amid a constructive consumer backdrop, and pricing could return as a top line lever for some given a reacceleration in input costs,\" they said.\n\nThey said they see continued momentum from market share gainers like Philip Morris and Monster Beverage Corporation. They warned, though, that companies with increasing competition from private labels and eroding returns on promotions\u2014like Kraft Heinz, Hershey and Clorox\u2014warrant more caution."

Hungry and skinny bears take more risks than fat bears.\"\n\nEssentially, eating berries and smaller prey isn't enough to tide a polar bear over.\n\n\"This study really brings home the message that there\u2019s no salvation from terrestrial feeding to help polar bears through the ice-free period,\" Derocher added.\n\nThe polar bear population in this area is estimated to have fallen 30 percent since 1987, and this study appears to prove that global warming will continue to make it even harder for the species to survive."

            "article_content": "The drones are everywhere, and Black internet is concerned. After weeks of complaints, the frenzy is reaching a new peak as mysterious drone sightings in New Jersey and now in parts of New York and Connecticut continue to ramp up, even leading government officials like Senator Cory Booker share concern about the lack of transparency from federal government officials about these alarming sightings.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been enough transparency,\u201d the Black Senator from New Jersey explained to CBS News. \u201cIt\u2019s allowing a lot of potential misinformation to spread or fear. We should know what\u2019s going on in our skies.\u201d\n\ntiktok-7447606032727084334\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Senator is certainly right about that, as the conspiracy theories have taken off on the internet, especially the Black internet. You know how it goes, we will absolutely bring up some conspiracies in our conversations and online as we already tend to be pretty wary of things. And now, even one of the biggest Black politicians in the country is stating his concern about drones, which makes matters even more worrisome. Naturally, the conversation has taken to social media with their ideas regarding the origin and meaning of these large, mysterious drones that are reportedly 6 feet in size, per AP News.\n\nOne user on X, formerly known as Twitter, echoes what many are feeling, writing that in their opinion there are two options when it comes to these drones, that \u201cthey really don\u2019t know what they are and, therefore, our air defense is extraordinarily weak,\u201d or \u201cthey know what they are but can\u2019t say.\u201d They added, \u201cNot sure which is crazier.\u201d\n\nThe same user also gave \u201ctin foil\u201d takes, that either the drones are aliens (classic) or that they are our government themselves.\n\nThe mysterious drones over Jersey.\n\n\n\n1. They really don\u2019t know what they are and, therefore, our air defense is extraordinarily weak; or\n\n\n\n2. They know what they are but can\u2019t say.\n\n\n\nNot sure which is crazier. \u2014 kyle alex brett (@kyalbr) December 13, 2024\n\nMy tin foil take.\n\n\n\n1. The drones belong to aliens who live under the ocean and they\u2019re intimidating our top secret government to stop the government from doing something; or\n\n\n\n2. It\u2019s our top secret government looking for something that has been stolen and emits a faint trace. \u2014 kyle alex brett (@kyalbr) December 14, 2024\n\nThe fact that the government seems to be just as much in the dark as we are certainly doesn\u2019t help matters either! We have gotten little confirmation from federal government officials in the days since the sightings increased. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said that they have \u201cno evidence\u201d that the drones are from an adversary or a foreign entity. She also said that the drones are \u201cnot U.S. military drones.\u201d Again, still not making any of us feel better!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\ntiktok-7447530870233222442\n\nThe House Homeland Security Committee also addressed concerns over the drones with the FBI in a now-viral TikTok from CBS News, with a representative confirming that they are \u201cactively\u201d investigating but they \u201cdon\u2019t have an answer\u201d for who is responsible. Again, the lack of answers has only led to more speculation, as seen in the comments of the Tiktok alone.\n\ntiktok-7447237219506474282\n\nAs ABC News has reported, the rise in conspiracy theories surrounding drones has even led to a massive Facebook page. Titled New Jersey Mystery Drones \u2014 let\u2019s solve it, the page has nearly 44,000 members as of Friday. On the page, theories are able to run wild as residents share their video footage, photos and sightings, while also offering their own suggestions for how to handle the situation, with some even suggesting shooting them down themselves.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Senator Booker shared when shooting them down was suggested, he explained, \u201cSafety first. You\u2019re over populous neighborhoods and areas,\u201d while adding that Jersey is the most densely populated state in America.\u201d He added, \u201cThe most important thing right now is the safety and security of our communities.\u201d\n\nOf course, along with the conspiracy theories, has come some levity on the internet as well, with some just marveling over the situation in general. One user on X took a little jab at the state of Jersey, writing, \u201cAlien 1: You know where we should go next? Alien 2: Where? Alien 1: New Jersey.\u201d Another shared the same sentiment, writing, \u201cOf course the alien invasion would start in New Jersey.\u201d\n\nAlien 1: You know where we should go next?\n\n\n\nAlien 2: Where?\n\n\n\nAlien 1: New Jersey. \u2014 Alex Cole (@acnewsitics) December 14, 2024\n\nOf course the alien invasion would start in New Jersey \u2014 Cydel (@cydelmg) December 14, 2024\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

            "article_content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nU.S. Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ), who posted to his X (formerly known as Twitter) account Friday a video he took of swarms of mysterious drones that have been spotted nightly during the past few weeks, said he was increasingly concerned about the unexplained phenomenon.\n\nKim, who joined local police in rural Clinton Township, New Jersey, 36 miles north of Trenton, said he spotted small clusters of two to four drones a number of times throughout the evening.\n\n\u201cWe often saw about 5-7 lights at a time that were low and not associated with aircraft we could see on the tracker app,\u201d Kim said, noting that the group used a flight tracker app to distinguish the drones from airplanes. \u201cSome hovered while others moved across the horizon.\u201d\n\nLast night I went out with local police to spot drone flying over New Jersey, here\u2019s what I saw. We drove to Round Valley Reservoir and the officer pointed to lights moving low over the tree line. Sometimes they were solid white light, others flashed of red and green.THREAD pic.twitter.com/ly7kUUDWDn \u2014 Andy Kim (@AndyKimNJ) December 13, 2024\n\nKim said police have tried to get close to the drones using helicopters, but when approached, the drones would turn off their lights and go dark, echoing a statement by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis has gone on for weeks,\u201d Kim wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand how with the technology we have we aren\u2019t able to track these devices to determine origin, and this makes me much more concerned about our capabilities more broadly when it comes to drone detection and countermeasures.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, eyewitnesses are pushing back against government claims that the drones pose no threat to communities or infrastructure. The growing story has spread to New York, Maryland, and Connecticut, where officials are demanding answers, while new reports of \u201ccar-sized\u201d UFOs were registered in California and parts of Europe.\n\n\u201cWhy is no one talking about the incident that caused an evac helicopter to not be able to pick up a patient due to these drones being in the way of where the helicopter had to go, and made the helicopter turn around and not be able to get the patient?\u201d New Jersey resident Roseann Stanley said on X. \u201cYet they are saying these drones have not caused any problems. That is a huge problem.\u201d\n\nOn November 26, a medical helicopter heading to an accident in Branchburg Township in Somerset County was unable to pick up an injured patient due to drones hovering near the landing zone, according to a report by New Jersey media outlet NJ.com.\n\nHundreds of drones were first spotted in mid-November flying over New Jersey; eyewitnesses have reported seeing convoys of drones almost every night since then and have described the crafts, in some cases, as being as big as the hood of a car, and performing in more sophisticated ways than off-the-shelf, consumer-oriented drones.\n\nThough the mysterious objects have been reported in the vicinity of a number of New Jersey-based military installations, with speculation about their provenance ranging from aliens from outer space to Iranian spycraft, Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Wednesday that no government facilities have been threatened by the drones.\n\nWhite House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said during a press conference on Thursday that \u201cwhile there is no known malicious activity occurring, the reported sightings there do, however, highlight a gap in authorities.\u201d\n\nKirby argued for new legislation that will better \u201cidentify and mitigate any potential threats to airports or other critical infrastructure, and so that state and local authorities are provided all the tools that they need to respond to such threats as well.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, many people believe the whole thing is much ado about nothing, and probably a stunt of some kind.\n\n\u201cI think these are just normal drones,\u201d Joseph Steinberg, a local resident, told Decrypt. \u201cMy daughter saw a large one, I went outside with her and we looked, but it was hard to judge the size.\u201d\n\n\"The first problem in situations like this is that beyond the initial drone sightings, you quickly get an overwhelming number of reports of things that aren\u2019t drones,\" Grant Jordan, the CEO of San Diego-based drone detection software company SkySafe, told Decrypt. \"When I look at these videos, the vast majority\u201499 out of 100\u2014aren't drones. They're aircraft, helicopters, satellites.\"\n\nAs Jordan explained, the flood of recent drone reports in New Jersey reveals two issues. First, people rarely observe the night sky, and mistake normal air traffic\u2014flashing lights, moving objects\u2014for something unusual. Second, judging the size and distance in the sky is difficult.\n\nWhile Jordan did not attribute these ongoing sightings to a growing hysteria, he did caution that copycats are likely at work, trying to capitalize on the public\u2019s fear and interest.\n\n\"When a story like this gets attention, it draws more people in\u2014some flying drones to look for others, and some just flying them to mess with people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are now seeing these drones in San Diego and the videos that were shown, it's just standard air traffic going into the San Diego Airport.\u201d\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

            "article_content": "In 2024, researchers turned up possible evidence of ancient life on Mars, hints that Alzheimer\u2019s disease can spread from person-to-person and a slew of other scientific findings that could be a big deal \u2014 if they\u2019re the real deal.\n\nMartian microbes, maybe\n\nAlien microbes may have once made their home on Mars (SN: 8/24/24, p. 6). In July, NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover uncovered a rock on the Red Planet that sports white spots with black rings laced with iron phosphate (see Page 28). On Earth, such specks have been linked to ancient micro\u00adbial life. But they\u2019re not surefire signs of microbes. The only way to know for certain is to bring the rock back to Earth for closer inspection.\n\nNASA\u2019s Perseverance rover discovered leopard spot\u2013like features in this Martian rock (closeup image shown). On Earth, similar structures are associated with microbial life. MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASA\n\nSparking superconductivity\n\nLight may be the secret ingredient for making superconductors that don\u2019t require frigid conditions. In an experiment, blasting a copper and oxygen compound with a laser caused the material to throw off magnetic fields. That magnetism, the scientists say, is a smoking gun for superconductivity \u2014 the ability to ferry electricity with no resistance (SN: 8/10/24, p. 6). But skeptics contend that those magnetic fields might have arisen from some other, unknown physics.\n\nIn experiments, a compound made of copper and oxygen atoms (blue and red spheres in this illustration) blasted with laser light (red) threw off magnetic fields (blue). This effect signals that the compound transformed into a superconductor, some physicists say. Sebastian Fava, J\u00f6rg M. Harms\n\nAncient engineering\n\nBuilders used a water-powered elevator to construct Egypt\u2019s first pyramid nearly 4,700 years ago, researchers propose (SN: 9/7/24 & 9/21/24, p. 11). That controversial idea is based on a computer model of structures in and around the Step Pyramid of Djoser. Controlling the flow of floodwater in and out of a shaft inside the pyramid could have lifted and lowered a block-hoisting platform, the model shows. But critics argue that occasional rains wouldn\u2019t have supplied enough water to sustain such a system.\n\nAncient workers could have built Egyptian King Djoser\u2019s pyramid (shown) using a water-powered elevator to hoist the heavy stone blocks, a computer simulation suggests. But not all archaeologists are on board with the idea. Anton Petrus/Moment/Getty Images\n\nTectonic shake-up\n\nPlate tectonics got off to an early start in Earth\u2019s history, a rock in South Africa suggests. Layers in the rock bear scars of 3-billion-year-old landslides that may have been caused by an earthquake (SN: 4/6/24, p. 6). That quake, scientists say, could have been triggered by slabs of crust colliding. The finding lends support to the contested idea that plate tectonics dates back more than 2.8 billion years. But other geologists are not convinced that this quake marks the start of global plate tectonics.\n\nLayers of rock at the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa contain hints of a huge earthquake triggered by plate tectonics more than 3 billion years ago. Simon Lamb\n\nMedium size, maximum hype\n\nFor the first time, astronomers may have spotted a midsize black hole in our galaxy (SN: 8/10/24, p. 7). Telescope data suggest that a black hole at least 8,200 times as massive as the sun lurks in the star cluster Omega Centauri. But another study disputes the claim. Instead, the star cluster could harbor a horde of smaller black holes (SN: 8/20/24).\n\nIf a rare midsize black hole truly does lurk in the heart of the Omega Centauri star cluster, it would be the first black hole of its size found in the Milky Way. In this Hubble Space Telescope image, the supposed black hole\u2019s location is marked by the white box. Hubble/ESA, NASA, M. H\u00e4berle/MPIA\n\nTransmissible Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is not contagious in everyday life, but under extremely rare conditions, it may spread from one person to another (SN: 2/24/24, p. 6). Five people who in childhood received contaminated growth hormone injections later developed early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 most likely because the hormones were tainted with amyloid-beta, a protein whose buildup is linked to the disease, researchers say. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether the growth hormones are to blame, other experts note. Perhaps the health conditions that those hormones were meant to treat or other medical procedures led to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s in these patients.\n\nHigh levels of the protein amyloid-beta \u2014 a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 appear orange and purple in this brain scan of a man with the disease. Childhood exposure to the protein via contaminated growth hormone injections may have led the man to develop Alzheimer\u2019s later in life. G. Banerjee et al/Nature Medicine 2024\n\nShedding light on dark energy\n\nDark energy may have gotten even more mysterious. The enigmatic stuff, which makes up the bulk of the cosmos, is generally thought to maintain a constant density. But new observations of 6.4 million galaxies and quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, or DESI, paired with data on exploding stars, cast doubt on that idea. These data more closely fit a model of the universe in which the relationship between dark energy\u2019s density and its pressure changes over time (SN: 5/4/24 & 5/18/24, p. 6). If confirmed, this finding would rewrite the history of the universe. Experts are withholding judgment until DESI completes its survey of over 30 million other galaxies (SN: 12/14/24 & 12/28/24, p. 7)."

This state of matter also has properties that mimic how light and particles interact in the universe.\n\nHowever, proving the theory has, until now, proved very challenging. To this end, the international team developed advanced experiments (like neutron-scattering) and theoretical models to attempt to observe this state of matter for the first time.\n\nAnd, by all accounts, they appear to have been successful.\n\nA major breakthrough\n\n\u201cFractional matter quasiparticles, long theorized in quantum spin liquids, required significant advancements in experimental resolution to be convincingly tested in this type of material,\u201d said Romain Sibille, the experimental team leader at Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland."

Addressing the teachers at his official residence, Mann lauded their successful training in Finland and emphasized the critical role they play in building a strong foundation for the nation\u2019s future.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historic day for Punjab as our teachers return equipped with world-class expertise,\u201d said the Chief Minister, urging the teachers to serve as role models, imparting skills and knowledge that would allow students to compete with their peers from private schools. The Chief Minister highlighted that the state\u2019s initiative to send 72 primary teachers for advanced training in Finland was not just a trip but a mission to overhaul the education system.\n\n\n\nMann elaborated on why Finland was chosen for this program, citing its globally acclaimed education system. \u201cThe training has provided our teachers with innovative techniques and best practices that will not only enhance their teaching abilities but also bring a much-needed boost to our education sector,\u201d he stated.\n\n\n\nThe program is aimed at broadening the professional skills of teachers, fostering leadership qualities, and equipping them with advanced pedagogical tools.\n\n\n\nThe Chief Minister emphasized that the enriched expertise of these educators would empower government school students to excel academically and socially. \u201cThis initiative will enable the creation of an education system that nurtures every child's potential,\u201d Mann asserted.\n\n\n\nMann called the Finland training program a \u201cred-letter day\u201d in Punjab\u2019s history. He expressed confidence that such initiatives would help Punjab become a frontrunner in education. \u201cThis training will act as a seed, growing into a tree of knowledge that benefits not just individuals but entire communities,\u201d he envisioned.\n\n\n\nTo further support these efforts, Mann announced plans for creating platforms where Finland-trained teachers could share their experiences and expertise with colleagues, fostering a culture of continuous improvement. He encouraged teachers to take pride in their transformative role, adding, \u201cEducation is the most powerful tool for progress, and you hold the keys to unlocking our state\u2019s potential.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Chief Minister also underscored the importance of aligning students\u2019 academic paths with their interests rather than societal pressures. He urged parents and teachers to nurture children\u2019s individual strengths, allowing them to achieve their aspirations.\n\n\n\nAdding an exciting dimension to the occasion, Education Minister Harjot Singh Bains announced upcoming student visits to premier institutions like the Indian Institute of Science and Google\u2019s headquarters. \u201cThis will provide students with valuable exposure to cutting-edge technologies and inspire them to dream big,\u201d he stated.\n\n\n\nTeachers Laud Initiative, Share Experiences\n\nEquipped with innovative methodologies, the delegation of 72 educators \u2014 including BPEOs, CHTs, HTs, and primary teachers \u2014 shared their transformative experiences.\n\n\n\nManmeet Singh, a teacher from Ludhiana, reflected on how Finland\u2019s playful learning techniques replaced their reliance on traditional methods. \u201cWe\u2019ve started sharing these techniques with fellow educators, and the results are promising,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBathinda\u2019s Daljit Singh recalled praise from Finnish trainer Cristina, who applauded Punjab\u2019s initiative. \u201cHer encouragement inspired us to share our experiences with local communities, bringing renewed energy to our teaching,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Talwara\u2019s Amrinderpal Singh Dhillon emphasized how the training instilled a profound sense of responsibility among the participants. \u201cThis visionary program will drive grassroots change in education,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBaljit Kaur Parmar, a primary teacher from Fatehgarh Sahib, expressed how the experience boosted her confidence. \u201cI feel equipped to contribute more effectively, both inside and outside the classroom,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nEducators were especially impressed by Finland\u2019s emphasis on practical education. Anoop Singh Maini from Tarn Taran highlighted, \u201cThe Finnish system focuses on practical learning alongside academics, a model we aspire to replicate in Punjab.\u201d\n\n\n\nSCERT director Amaninder Kaur Brar emphasized the need for integrating practical tools into classrooms, such as carpentry workshops, to provide hands-on learning experiences. \u201cThis approach will ensure students apply theoretical knowledge effectively,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\nSeveral teachers acknowledged the psychological benefits of the training. Hoshiarpur\u2019s Vandana Heen said: \u201cIt was a joyful learning experience that encouraged us to rethink our teaching practices.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers, like Nirmaljeet Kaur of Tarn Taran, highlighted Finland\u2019s unique approach to time management and moral education. \u201cThese lessons will prove invaluable as we apply them in our schools,\u201d she shared.\n\n"
