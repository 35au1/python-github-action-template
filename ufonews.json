        "article_content": "There are many reasons that creating a video game can take a long time. It may take a while to land on the mechanics, or to nail the story beats. For big-budget games, the sheer scale of ambition and world building can cause development cycles nearly a decade long, during which shifting audience trends may force a developer to scrap its initial vision.\n\nFor UFO 50, which began its development in 2016, the protracted path to completion is right there in the name: It is not just one video game, but 50.\n\nThere are arcade-style sports games (Bushido Ball, Hot Foot), platformers (Cyber Owls, Mini & Max), puzzle games (Block Koala), deck builders (Party House), role-playing games (Grimstone) and dungeon crawlers (Valbrace). While each \u201980s-style title is not necessarily feature length by modern terms, they\u2019re fully built out, with narratives, multiple levels and multiplayer modes when appropriate."

        "article_content": "Discovery in video games has changed over the last 40 years. While we are arguably in a golden age of creativity and innovation in the medium, it's a different type of creativity than when games were in their infancy--learning to crawl, grappling for new ideas, and guessing at best practices. Modern-day games have become largely standardized, and that's mostly for the better. But when we look back at retro game collections like the NES Classic or compilations from Digital Eclipse, we're often remembering the trailblazers, not the oddballs. That's what makes UFO 50 so special--it invokes the sense of wild experimentation and surprise that you would find in a cross-section of the earliest video games.\n\nThe pitch is simple: UFO 50 is a compilation of fictional retro games made throughout the 1980s by a prolific developer called UFO Soft. They range from 1982 to 1989, and span across the entire gamut of retro genres. The presentation leans into this, as selecting a game for the first time has you blowing the dust off of it. You get the sense that you discovered these forgotten gems in an attic or garage sale. And for the most part, the games carry the design and story aesthetic that was common in '80s games, which I would describe as \"sci-fi pulp as reimagined by early computer programmers.\"\n\nIn reality, of course, the games were created by a team of modern-day developers led by Spelunky's Derek Yu. That makes the decision to make not just a retro game but 50 retro games remarkably ambitious. One would expect such a massive undertaking to result in minigames at most, but that is not the case. These are almost universally the size and scope of actual games you would buy in the 1980s--still often smaller than the games we'd expect today, but not compromised for their fictional time period.\n\nThe character-select screen in Fist Hell\n\nGallery\n\nAnd while UFO 50 doesn't tell a straightforward narrative story, there is a lot of richness to be found in the meta-fiction of UFO Soft. You see the logo changing over time. The games themselves get more complex and more refined, and have better art direction and better quality-of-life features, over the fictional timeline. The games themselves have little notes about their development, and you can piece together criss-crossing plotlines involving the studio's personalities and leadership. The occasional sequel will appear, showing an early style of iterative development that might result in radically different gameplay styles springing from the same core concepts. One of the games--a point-and-click adventure called Night Manor--has glimpses of the early cinematic achievement that you could see being influential in the fiction of the world.\n\nLike a lot of early games, the simplicity of the controls means you more-or-less figure out the game by playing. This can be slightly frustrating sometimes, especially when a game ventures into territory with more complex, board game-like mechanics, like Devilition. Others, like Mooncat, have strange and counterintuitive controls that I struggled to get a proper feel for. This is realistic in that a lot of old video games tried to approximate board-game complexity or experiment with control schemes, but the wealth of other games to play made it difficult to remain patient with those more inscrutable ones.\n\nDespite basing themselves around retro games, though, most of these have some special twist or feature that makes them stand out from similar games of their genre. You can mark a game as a favorite for easy reference later, and as I reached further and the games grew more refined, I kept marking more and more of them, eager to go back and experience them all to their fullest. And while UFO 50 is very casual in how it lets you approach the games in any order, there is a reward for delving deeply into each one--you get rewards to place in your garden for an achievement in each game, along with a golden cartridge for finishing it.\n\nTo give a taste, here are mini-reviews of some of my favorites in the compilation:\n\nMortol\n\nThis puzzle platformer gives you an array of peons willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good, making your resources and lives draw from the same large pool. Each one can perform a \"ritual\" to stick into walls, turn into a stone block, or blow up passages, so you progress through the stage by carefully managing when and how to sacrifice them to keep progressing further. It was followed by a sequel, Mortol II, later in the collection, which includes a more sophisticated class-based system for utilizing your willing sacrifices, but there's something very pure and engaging about the original idea.\n\nBushido Ball\n\nA dodgeball-meets-fighting game with a selection of samurai characters to choose from. You smack the projectiles with your katana to ricochet it back at the other side, and on top of requiring precision timing, each character has their own special abilities, providing lots of replay value and room for skill-building.\n\nCamouflage\n\nCamouflage is a brilliant little puzzle game with a root in stealth mechanics. As a largely helpless chameleon, you need to navigate to your home while avoiding watchful predators. But being a chameleon, you can change your colors to match the tile you're standing on. That makes navigating through a stage a tense exercise in planning your route to pick up new camouflage patterns. For extra challenge, each stage has collectibles to pick up, including a baby chameleon who will follow you around and pick up its own camouflage pattern, thus doubling the challenge.\n\nParty House\n\nPossibly my favorite surprise of the bunch, Party House is an ingenious puzzle game with mechanics similar to modern deck-builders. You're given a strict number of turns to throw a series of parties, and you control the guest list. Each guest comes with bonuses to your cash and popularity--cash expands your house, and popularity goes toward inviting new guests. Some guests have \"Troublemaker\" attributes that will attract the cops, while others might sacrifice some popularity for cash, or vice-versa. Dancers stack as a multiplier for popularity. One party-goer even brings a random friend who risks overloading your party and summoning the fire marshall to kick someone out.\n\nThe party commences, a random assortment of your rolodex of party-goers shows up, and you tabulate your cash and popularity to put toward the next party, all while steering toward some particular win condition like having four aliens attend a single party. It's shockingly compelling, and easy to keep the party going for just one more turn late into the night.\n\nThe cops break up the party in Party House\n\nThe Big Bell Race\n\nThe is one of the shortest games of the collection but also one most suited to multiplayer. The Big Bell Race is pure game mechanics: You're a spaceship navigating through a boxy maze-like racetrack while bouncing off the other racing ships and grabbing power-ups that create track hazards for your competitors. A single tournament is eight quick races, but the competition can be fierce, and you can always play two-player to bump elbows against a friend.\n\nWarptank\n\nAt first glance, Warptank appears similar to the classic Blaster Master tank segments, but it's the \"warp\" in the name that really sets it apart. At any point, your tank can flip from floor to ceiling or to opposing walls. Navigating a stage is a delicate balance of avoiding traps and taking out enemies by frequently gaining access to new vantage points, giving it a fierce action-game feeling that also tickles your brain.\n\nVainger\n\nThis metroidvania-like platformer has a hook similar to Warptank, but the application of it in this genre makes it feel very different. As an alien soldier, you can swap the gravity polarity by double-tapping the jump button, so all of the traps and enemies are positioned to take advantage of stages that could be upside-down at any time. The result is something like the second quest of Symphony of the Night in a reversed castle, except you control when the whole thing flips on its head.\n\nThe alien protagonist of Vainger\n\nPingolf\n\nLots of early games tried to approximate sports like golf, but Pingolf is a more modern take with a sci-fi aesthetic. The side-scrolling stages are set up like platforming stages with some elements of pinball, with narrow corners and bounce pads. It feels not quite like anything else, though the closest analogue is probably the recent Cursed to Golf.\n\nFist Hell\n\nIt wouldn't be a retro-style compilation without a River City Ransom riff, but Fist Hell sets itself apart with fantastic pixel art and an engaging hook: zombies! You're taking on the hordes of the undead with nothing but your fists and found objects, which leads to neat twists like lopping the skull off of one zombie and throwing it at another. It's the kind of comical early gore that felt daring in the '80s, and with four characters to choose from, there's lots of replay value.\n\nValbrace\n\nAnother surprising favorite from a genre I haven't had much experience with, Valbrace is a first-person dungeon-crawling RPG, similar to Dungeon Master or Wizardry 2. The presentation is top-notch for emulating the peculiar, pixelated look of those dungeon crawlers, and when you encounter monsters, you enter a more active real-time third-person combat system. What really helps it stand out, though, is the magic system, which maps spells onto a particular pattern drawn with your D-pad. You discover those spells as you proceed through the dungeon, but even if you die, the spell pattern will still work on your next run. That means if you can remember the spells--or map them onto graph paper--you'll make each subsequent run that much easier.\n\nFighting goblins in Valbrace\n\nRakshasa\n\nA side-scrolling action game along the lineage of Ghosts & Goblins, this one has you taking on hordes of demons with a unique revival mechanic. You're extremely vulnerable to attacks and bound to die, but each time you die, you can recover your life by navigating around the demons of the spiritual plane. Each time you die, more demons are added, making it increasingly difficult--but not impossible--to recover your body.\n\nStar Waspir\n\nThis is less of a retro genre reimagined, and more of an anachronistic take on the bullet hell. Lots of shoot-'em-ups graced the NES and its similarly powered consoles, but Star Waspir has the tense risk-reward dynamic of populating constant power-ups that are just temptingly close to enemy fire. It's the kind of tough, responsive combat that has made the genre such a hit, given new context through a retro filter.\n\nGrimstone\n\nAn old-school JRPG-style game set in a fantastical version of the Old West, Grimstone begins as an angel rescues a handful of adventurers from a burning saloon, who then form a posse to go after outlaws. The aesthetic is reminiscent of the earliest Final Fantasy games, but its setting and a timing-based combat system gives it a modern twist.\n\nLords of Diskonia\n\nWhat if a strategy game got a dose of air hockey? Lords of Diskonia has you collect income from villages and use it to buy an army of knights, archers, champions, and more, and then take them into battle. But far from a typical warzone, your soldiers here are differently sized circular disks who get fired into and bump against enemy units to attack. It's a wildly different take on the strategy genre and feels tactical and dynamic at once.\n\nCyber Owls\n\nThe final game of the collection is also a smart, cheeky commentary on the prominence of Turtle-mania in the late '80s, and the efforts from just about every cartoon studio or video game developer to make their own franchise-friendly animals with attitude. Cyber Owls is the kind of game you'd see then, with an elite band of owl soldiers, each with their own stages to match their specialty--from beat-'em-up to stealth action. It's probably the single most varied game of the set, and one of the most cinematic, serving as a perfect bookend to the fictional journey of game development throughout the decade.\n\nSimply put, UFO 50 is an audacious triumph. Dozens of the games are compelling enough to warrant a full playthrough, and even some of the less successful experiments have some intriguing element or inventive idea to draw you in. Best of all, it's exciting to have such a rich vein of strange, creative video game experiences to examine. This is nostalgia, but not the candy-coated feeling of reliving what we've already experienced. It's remembering how it felt to discover something new."

        "article_content": "WEST PARIS \u2014 Deb Hewins was interviewed recently for \u201cCursed Echoes: Beyond the Veil,\u201d a paranormal documentary about the notorious Bridgewater Triangle.\n\nThe Bridgewater Triangle is an area about 200 square miles in southeastern Massachusetts that has had an unusually high number of reports of alleged paranormal phenomena, including unidentified flying objects, poltergeists, and other spectral events, sightings of Bigfoot-like creatures and giant snakes and birds.\n\nCryptozoologist Loren Coleman coined the term in the 1970s in the book \u201cMysterious America\u201d after researching the area and its paranormal reports.\n\nHewins, who lives in Mechanic Falls, moved to Bridgewater, Massachusetts, when she was 9 years old. The move happened shortly after a curious incident with her father in which he was unresponsive or frozen in time for several minutes while reading the newspaper one Sunday morning.\n\nHewins said her father told the family that they had to move to Bridgewater \u201cbecause God told him to.\u201d\n\nDuring the recent interview in West Paris, Hewins described her paranormal experiences and encounters, or \u201cvisits,\u201d from extraterrestrials she has experienced along with her twin sister, Audrey Hewins, as far back as they both can remember.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would tell my parents I was afraid to go to bed. I was afraid the bald men were going to get me,\u201d Hewins said. \u201cI was seeing all sorts of things behind the veil that people don\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nLiving near the Hockomock Swamp and the Freetown-Fall River State Forest, sites where many strange occurrences have been reported, only intensified the experiences that the twins were having, Hewins said during the documentary interview.\n\n\u201cWe had the Hockomock swamp pretty much in our backyard,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nShe said there are many different extraterrestrial species that she sees and communicates with, both benevolent and malevolent.\n\n\u201cAll these beings are highly intelligent,\u201d Hewins said. \u201cAnd they know everything about us because they\u2019re telepathic.\u201d\n\nShe described a battle between the dark and the light side of these beings, which she called angels and demons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHewins eventually realized how to repel the negative beings, by projecting love.\n\n\u201cEvery religion has pieces of the truth but, where they are in certain parts of the world, things are different. Things are interpreted differently,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nShe said there is a \u201cspiritual awakening\u201d happening in the world that is being helped along by extraterrestrials.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s falling apart. If somebody doesn\u2019t intervene, we\u2019re in trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cI do believe this is a global intervention and they\u2019re doing it in steps.\u201d\n\nShortly after moving to Maine in 2006, the Hewins twins founded Starborn Support, a national online support group \u201cto assist and provide emotional support to those who feel they have had an extraterrestrial encounter,\u201d according to the group\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine doing this alone. A lot of people do it. That\u2019s why I started the support group,\u201d Hewins said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group hosts gatherings for \u201cexperiencers,\u201d those who report having a UFO or ET encounter.\n\nAfter the interview on Sept. 11, Hewins, filmmaker Tyler Roberts, and film producer Jess Weiner gathered with other experiencers to call on ETs to visit and then watch the sky for UFOs.\n\nThe group saw several bright floating dots that could not be readily identified, but many were suspected satellites moving across the night sky.\n\nAccording to NASA\u2019s website, UFOs can be \u201crocket launches, comets, military jets, weather balloons, sounding rockets, satellites, meteors and fireballs, experimental craft (if you are lucky) and odd clouds (such as lenticular clouds, which are lentil-shaped and resemble flying saucers).\u201d\n\nIn recent years, UFOs, or as the federal government has started referring to them, unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs, have gained mainstream attention with hearings held before the U.S. Congress.\n\nFilmmaker Roberts grew up in Billerica, which is a part of the triangle and home to what he referred to as the \u201cmost haunted road in Massachusetts.\u201d He feels like he is meant to tell the story he is crafting in his first feature-length film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe more I think the world is black and white, the more gray I see,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nHe also traveled to Bridgewater and Salem, Massachusetts, where he encountered many synchronicities which led him to Hewins.\n\n\u201cThese are things I\u2019m running into, and I can\u2019t ignore them,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s slapping me in the face over and over again, saying \u2018tell the story.\u2019\u201d\n\nRoberts hosts a podcast, \u201cTotal Disclosure,\u201d in which he interviews people about UFOs and cover-up conspiracies, including credible sources like retired federal government officials.\n\nThere is a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for post-production expenses on Roberts\u2019 self-funded documentary. The trailer is expected to be released in October, just in time for \u201cspooky season,\u201d he said."

        "article_content": "Maxis has pushed out The Sims 4 update 1.99 on both consoles and PC this September 18, and this is one heck of a patch. There\u2019s a lot of improvements touching on performance, the base game\u2019s various bugs, the various expansions got fixes as well. There\u2019s a lot to take in, so read on for what\u2019s new in The Sims 4 in the official patch notes.\n\nThe Sims 4 Update 1.99 Patch Notes:\n\nSul Sul, Simmers!\n\nThis patch is a big one and brings many new updates and fixes into the game that span across different packs, including improvements to apartment walls, ceiling lighting, and a whole host of fixes for our recently released expansion pack, Lovestruck. These, along with so many more across both Base Game and Packs, can be found below.\n\nThank you for your continued reporting efforts at AnswersHQ. It really helps to let us know the issues you care most about. We hope these fixes keep improving your game and allow you to keep having more fun! More to come.\n\nThe Sims 4 team\n\nWhat\u2019s New in The Sims 4\n\nThere\u2019s a colorful update to Build/Buy items! 650 color variants have been added and there are new items such as archways, doors, and even ground covers to spruce up your terrain. Check out the vibrant colors and new items in the video. For more details, scroll to the end of the patch notes to see a list of all the Build/Buy items. We can\u2019t wait to see how you mix and match!\n\nPerformance\n\nReducing Memory Usage:\n\nFrequent Memory Updates \u2013 Increased the frequency of memory usage data updates to prevent out-of-memory crashes.\n\nImproving Simulation Performance:\n\nStreamlining Data Storage \u2013 We restructured how we store game data to reduce the overhead of using Python objects, making the game run faster and use less memory.\n\nEfficient Buff Generation \u2013 Reworked how temporary data is generated and stored to fix previous issues and optimize memory usage.\n\nReducing Load Times:\n\nOptimizing Render Target Allocation \u2013 Stopped unnecessary allocation of large color targets during certain rendering processes, now saving valuable memory especially in high-resolution settings.\n\nDirectX 11 (DX11) Updates\n\nWe\u2019re pleased to announce improvements to the DirectX 11 executable for PC users. While these updates are focused on Windows PC\u2019s, Xbox Simmers will also see benefits from these changes as the Xbox runs a console-based variant of DirectX 11. Here\u2019s what to expect:\n\nNVIDIA and AMD\n\nNVIDIA and AMD Graphics Cards Players using NVIDIA and AMD GPUs will now automatically default to the DX11 executable. Players on other GPUs like Intel, will continue to enjoy The Sims 4 on DX9 until a later update.\n\nDirectX 11 Enhancements Faster Graphics Processing \u2013 Implemented changes to how graphics data is updated, reducing delays between the CPU and GPU for smoother gameplay.\n\nPerformance Boost with Constant Buffers (cbuffers) This enhances performance by reducing overhead and managing memory more efficiently. Users with mid to high-end GPUs should notice improved performance!\n\nNew DirectX 9 Option in Graphics Setting\n\nBy default, Simmers on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs will launch The Sims 4 using DX11. If you prefer, you can switch to DX9 via Game Options > Graphics and enable the DirectX 9 toggle before re-launching The Sims 4 to play using DirectX 9.\n\n\n\nIntel\n\nOngoing Intel Development We are continuing development on bringing DirectX 11 to Intel GPU based PC\u2019s but it needs a little longer before we can bring it to Simmers as the default option. For now Intel based Simmers will continue to use DirectX 9 when running The Sims 4.\n\nDirectX 11 Opt-In\n\nDirectX 11 is available for those Simmers who want to try it, including those using an Intel GPU, you may experience visual issues with mods. We recommend disabling all mods while using the -dx11 command line argument.\n\n\n\nThe Gallery\n\nPack filters now properly work for Home Chef Hustle in The Gallery and library.

        "article_content": "The University of Texas at Austin has been chosen to lead a new institute that harnesses artificial intelligence to explore some of the leading mysteries of the universe, including dark matter and the fundamentals related to the search for life. Housed in UT\u2019s Oden Institute for Computational Sciences and Engineering, the NSF-Simons AI Institute for Cosmic Origins will be funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Simons Foundation. Its mission is to develop AI technologies for astronomical research to advance our understanding of the cosmos and accelerate the pace of new scientific discoveries.\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting opportunity to advance our understanding and help answer some of the most fundamental questions about the universe. As part of our campus, NSF-Simons CosmicAI will drive discovery using AI, enabled by an incredible set of talented people and the largest GPU cluster in all of academia. And, through the Oden Institute, it will collaborate with eight scientific domains that are among the best in the country,\u201d said UT President Jay Hartzell. \u201cAs astronomical data tend to be public and nonproprietary, CosmicAI aligns with our University\u2019s mission to use open AI as an enabler for the public good. We are grateful for our partnership with NSF and the Simons Foundation to launch this institute.\u201d\n\nCosmicAI, which further advances UT\u2019s \u201cYear of AI\u201d initiative, will unite an interdisciplinary group of faculty members and researchers under one umbrella to expand AI innovation in astronomy. It will span eight departments with more than 17 faculty members in the areas of astronomy, computer science, statistics and data science, linguistics, information sciences, math, mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering.\n\n\u201cBy building next-generation AI tools, the institute will accelerate discoveries related to the most basic human question: \u2018Where do we come from?\u2019 The CosmicAI research will investigate the origins of the universe including the formation of galaxies, stars, planets and even the building blocks for life,\u201d said Stella Offner, director of the new institute. Offner is an associate professor of astronomy in the College of Natural Sciences and co-director of the Center for Scientific Machine Learning at the Oden Institute.\n\nCosmicAI will develop AI approaches to efficiently process large astronomical datasets, explore the nature of dark matter and model prebiotic molecules that are key to life in the universe. The institute also plans to democratize access to astronomical data by developing a powerful AI-based astronomy \u201cco-pilot\u201d to streamline the scientific method in astrophysics and assist researchers with visualizing data, producing statistical analyses, understanding the scientific literature and more.\n\n\u201cThe Oden Institute is thrilled to provide an interdisciplinary home for CosmicAI. It has been particularly exciting to see cross-campus collisions taking place and laying foundations for this exciting new effort,\u201d said Karen Willcox, director of the Oden Institute.\n\nWith a goal to make AI training and methods accessible to all, the grant includes extensive education and outreach components to help train the AI-literate workforce of tomorrow. From multitiered programs to engage high school students with astronomy data, to research training for undergraduates, to graduate-level courses offered through an AI-astronomy certificate-type program, CosmicAI will build opportunities through reducing barriers, lowering costs and expanding online opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, CosmicAI will leverage the resources of the Texas Advanced Computing Center to launch a data platform that hosts large astronomical datasets within an AI-enabled analysis. The data platform will serve as a nexus for community calculations and collaboration.\n\nThe new institute will be co-directed by Matthew Lease, professor in UT\u2019s School of Information and an expert in AI modeling and human-computer interaction. He is a faculty founder and leader of the University\u2019s Good Systems initiative, a nine-year campuswide grand challenge to develop ethical AI technologies.\n\n\u201cIt is exciting to witness AI transforming the scientific discovery pipeline, which will accelerate progress at an unprecedented pace, unlocking innovations that promise to transform our understanding of the universe,\u201d said Arya Farahi, a research group lead for CosmicAI and assistant professor in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences at UT.\n\nThe new National Artificial Intelligence Research Institute for astronomical sciences is part of the NSF-led National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes program, which now includes 27 AI institutes across the U.S., two of them led by UT: the AI Institute for Foundations of Machine Learning and CosmicAI. The new institute will receive $20 million over five years: $10 million from NSF and $10 million from the Simons Foundation.\n\nInstitutional partners in NSF-Simons CosmicAI include the NSF National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, the NSF National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the University of Virginia, the University of Utah and the University of California, Los Angeles. These institutions will be joined by private collaborators, including the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which drives open-source generative AI efforts in the scientific domain through their foundation model OLMo.\n\nLearn more at cosmicai.oden.utexas.edu."

        "article_content": "For years, scientists thought they had a good grasp on what happens when a molecule of water meets air. You know, the stuff we read in textbooks? Turns out, we\u2019ve been wrong.\n\nA group of researchers discovered that the molecules at the surface of salt water organize themselves in a way that\u2019s totally different than we ever thought.\n\nDr. Yair Litman from the Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry led the team, and this revelation shakes up some long-held beliefs in climate science.\n\nIt might sound like just another science experiment, but this one has real-world implications, especially when it comes to understanding how our atmosphere works and how to mitigate human impacts on the planet.\n\nChemistry at the surface of water molecules\n\nWhen we think about where important chemical reactions happen, we might not immediately picture the surface of the ocean or a glass of salt water. But that\u2019s exactly where critical interactions take place, especially when water meets air.\n\nThink of it: the evaporation of ocean water affects our climate, drives weather patterns, and even influences the chemistry of the air we breathe. It\u2019s a big deal.\n\nFor years, the science community has been trying to get a handle on exactly what happens at that surface, particularly how ions \u2014 those tiny charged particles in salt \u2014 behave when they hang out at the water\u2019s edge.\n\nAre they neatly lined up? Do they play nice with water molecules? Well, until now, it was all pretty much guesswork. The exact behavior of ions at the water-air interface has been hotly debated.\n\nThat\u2019s where Litman\u2019s team, along with Dr. Kuo-Yang Chiang from the Max Planck Institute, comes in. Their study, published in Nature Chemistry, changes the game.\n\nBy combining cutting-edge technology with advanced simulations, they\u2019ve shown that water molecules at the surface of salt water don\u2019t behave the way we\u2019ve always thought. And yes, this is big news.\n\nLooking at the surface of water molecules\n\nThe traditional view, found in most textbooks, was simple: ions, which are either positively or negatively charged, line up at the surface and organize water molecules in one direction. But according to this new research, that\u2019s not how things work at all.\n\nThe team used a more advanced form of a technique called vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG). In the past, VSFG allowed scientists to look at molecular vibrations on the surface of water.\n\nBut it had a flaw \u2014 it couldn\u2019t tell whether these vibrations were positive or negative, which made it hard to interpret what was really going on. Kind of like trying to figure out a conversation by only hearing half of it.\n\nTrying a different technique\n\nThat\u2019s where heterodyne-detected (HD)-VSFG came into play. This technique takes things a step further, allowing the team to not only measure the vibrations but also figure out their direction.\n\nThe result? They discovered that ions at the surface of salt water don\u2019t just form a single layer and organize water molecules in one direction.\n\nInstead, ions organize water molecules both up and down, flipping the textbook model on its head.\n\n\u201cOur work demonstrates that the surface of simple electrolyte solutions has a different ion distribution than previously thought,\u201d Litman explained.\n\n\u201cAt the very top, there are a few layers of pure water, followed by an ion-rich layer, and then the bulk salt solution.\u201d\n\nThis means that, rather than ions neatly lining up and orienting water molecules in one direction, they create a much more complex and dynamic environment.\n\nIt\u2019s like discovering that your once-quiet neighborhood is actually buzzing with activity behind closed doors.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking, \u201cOkay, but why should I care how ions behave at the surface of water?\u201d The answer lies in how this discovery affects atmospheric science.\n\nThe surface of water \u2014 especially ocean water \u2014 is where a lot of important reactions take place. Evaporation, cloud formation, and even how pollutants break down in the atmosphere all hinge on these water-air interfaces.\n\nWhen we don\u2019t fully understand how ions behave at the water\u2019s surface, we can\u2019t make accurate models for climate science. And in a world where understanding climate is crucial, having an accurate model is everything.\n\nDr. Kuo-Yang Chiang from the Max Planck Institute adds that this research not only deepens our understanding of liquid interfaces but could also be applied to other fields.\n\n\u201cThis paper shows that combining high-level HD-VSFG with simulations is an invaluable tool that will contribute to the molecular-level understanding of liquid interfaces.\u201d\n\nIn other words, this important revelation could help scientists develop better technologies for things like batteries and energy storage.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe it\u2019ll even help us better understand how to manage some of the environmental issues we\u2019re facing today.\n\nTechnique has far-reaching applications\n\nThe implications of this study don\u2019t stop at atmospheric science. Mischa Bonn, head of the Molecular Spectroscopy department at the Max Planck Institute, believes that this discovery could pave the way for a deeper understanding of other interfaces, like those found in batteries.\n\n\u201cThese types of interfaces occur everywhere on the planet, so studying them not only helps our fundamental understanding but can also lead to better devices and technologies,\u201d Bonn explained.\n\nIf we can get a better grip on how molecules behave on the surface of salt water, it could improve our understanding of how they behave on the surface of a solid material, too. That\u2019s huge for anyone working on improving batteries or other energy storage solutions.\n\nThis is one of those discoveries where the impact might not be immediately obvious, but down the road, it could change everything \u2014 from how we build devices to how we think about climate science.\n\nApplications of this water molecule discovery\n\nTo sum it all up, the findings from Dr. Litman\u2019s team are just the beginning. Their discovery challenges decades of assumptions about water and ions, and it opens the door to a whole new area of research.\n\nThe next steps? Applying these techniques to even more complex systems, like the interactions between water and solids, which could help us understand everything from pollution to clean energy.\n\nIt\u2019s rare that a scientific discovery completely rewrites what we thought we knew. But when it does, it\u2019s a reminder that science is always evolving.\n\nThe full study was published in the journal Nature Chemistry.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

The fossil site is only accessible by helicopter.\n\nOver 90 fossils were found, including teeth belonging to a relative of the T-Rex, teeth belonging to a relative of the Triceratops, bones from a large herbivore, and a foot belonging to a small meat-eater.\n\nFurther analysis, including extracting the fossils from concrete-like rock, is needed, but the findings could potentially mean discovering a species unknown to science.\n\nDinosaurs once roamed parts of BC, and this discovery could help researchers understand more about the specifics of the ones who did.\n\n\u201cThis is truly a remarkable discovery that will not only help us to understand more about the dinosaurs who roamed British Columbia but also highlights the remarkable dedication of this team of researchers,\u201d said Royal BC Museum CEO Tracey Drake.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in checking out the fossils, you\u2019ll have to wait a couple of years, including a visit to Colwood, BC.\n\n\u201cVisitors will have the opportunity to observe the research process through viewing windows into the palaeontology lab at PARC Campus.\u201d\n\nThe Royal BC Museum says that evidence of dinosaurs in BC can even be found on Vancouver Island, the Kootenays and the Peace Region.\n\nYou can read more about dinosaurs in BC here."

Singh says the debate around Newsom\u2019s AI policies \u201cis bringing a lot of focus on what a good governance framework look like.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs companies \u201care building very powerful foundation models that potentially could impact massive misinformation concerns [and] cyber attacks, we need to start thinking about how do you put guardrails\u201d on the tech, Singh says.\n\nHeading into the presidential election, Singh believes \u201cAI is going to be one of the most critical points moving forward, irrespective of who comes to power. This is going to be a core agenda for all the legislatures across the globe.\u201d\n\nSingh says AI governance should matter to investors because a safe and responsible framework is the way to see AI investments pay off. \u201cWe are seeing day in and day out companies and enterprises using [Credo\u2019s] software, they are able to build trust, [and] as a result of which they are able to not only acquire new customers faster, they are able to retain customers.\u201d\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Asking for a Trend.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan."
