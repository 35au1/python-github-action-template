            "article_content": "A flight crew on a private Surjet plane bound for Florida witnessed a bizarre phenomenon while flying over the Bahamas at high altitude. According to the New York Post, the crew - consisting of two pilots and a flight attendant - saw strange, glowing orbs darting around in the night sky, leaving them stunned. The incident occurred on December 23 as they flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane when they received a transmission from Miami air traffic control.\n\nThe flight attendant said she saw the objects appear as white lights in the night sky and transform into green as they observed. Cassandra Martin shared her extraordinary experience with NBC News, revealing that the mysterious object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness.\n\n\"It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it. All of a sudden I heard traffic control say, we have a foreign object, can you please identify it? I looked to the left, and a pilot saw three objects, I only saw one, and I grabbed my phone, I just pressed it to the window to see if I could get a video of what the object was,\" Ms Martin told NBC Miami.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again, and we were about 43, 45 thousand feet and it was way above us,\" she added.\n\nThe object's high altitude and irregular \"zig-zag\" movements, as described by Ms Martin, effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon, respectively.\n\n\"I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is. Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,\" Ms Martin explained."

There is no doubt in the world that this house is a very haunted house. It always has been.\n\n\"It started off with smaller things that nobody really cared about.\n\n\"The doors would open, the kettle would turn itself on, the implements by the fire would swing back and forward, the doors would open and shut, the latches on the doors would go up, the taps would turn on. All that general stuff.\n\n\"All of the sudden the room would go freezing cold and you could see the black thing there. That started off quite soon, within days really. I knew the first day.\n\n\"I've been the guardian of this special house since 2004. It's now time for me to let somebody else look after it.\"\n\nThirteen witches were kept there before they were put on trial.\n\nThe most famous was Ursula Kemp who was tried for witchcraft and hanged in 1582 along with two others.\n\n7 Vanessa claimed mysterious blood spatters appeared on the walls Credit: swns\n\n7 The kitchen possesses plenty of character Credit: swns\n\n7 The most recent owners used the two-bed property as a holiday let\n\nThe Cage remained as a prison for men, women and children up until 1908 before it became a private residence.\n\nThe house featured in Channel 4 documentary True Horror 'The Witches Prison' which aired on Halloween night in 2018.\n\nParanormal experts have visited from all over the world.\n\nVanessa has also penned a book \u2018Spirits of the Cage\u2019 about the events.\n\nShe left the home with son Jesse in 2008 to move into rented accommodation and has since desperately been trying to flog it.\n\nThe cottage itself comprises three reception rooms, a kitchen, a ground floor cloakroom, plus two bedrooms and a bathroom on the split level first floor.\n\nA plaque on the building describes the plight of Ursula Kemp, who was imprisoned in The Cage on suspicion of witchcraft before being hanged in Chelmsford in 1582.\n\nEstate agent Florent Lambert, director of Home Domus, said: \u201cVanessa did try to sell The Cage numerous times since 2008 and with a number of different estate agents.\n\n\u201cMost agents advised her to sell at auction at ridiculous prices or were not at all interested as they predicted it could not be sold.\n\n\u201cI took it as a challenge and a mission to find the way to best sell it.\u201d"

            "article_content": "At one point in Choo Mantar, we see the chilling hide-and-clap scene from The Conjuring being played on a tablet. It\u2019s a terrific scene that relies more on concept than sound. Karvaa Navaneeth\u2019s latest horror drama needed such out-of-the-box thinking to achieve its full potential.\n\nChoo Mantar has all the tropes of a typical horror film. You have a haunted mansion built during the British era. Expectedly, there is a backstory to it. Unusual happenings inside the bungalow trap a family of four, and a paranormal activist has to crack the mystery.\n\nSharan plays the ghostbuster who decides to fix the dreaded reputation of the mansion. Called Dynamo, he is hailed as one of the best paranormal researchers in the country. His subordinates are essayed by Chikkanna, Aditi Prabhudeva, and Kiran Chandrashekhar.\n\nChoo Mantar (Kannada) Director: Karvaa Navaneeth Cast: Sharan, Chikkanna, Aditi Prabhudeva, Meghana Gaonkar, Runtime: 142 minutes Storyline: Four friends enter a haunted house looking for a treasure. Unexpected events threaten their lives\n\nChoo Mantar begins as a horror comedy, with Chikkanna and Sharan delivering witty lines, but the humour soon loses its sheen because the dialogues turn from cheeky to silly. The film takes quite a while to get going, with the first big twist arriving at the interval point. The surprise, though, is worth the wait, and Navaneeth sets the film up nicely, only to deliver an underwhelming second half.\n\nThe film lacks solid jump scares. Showing the ghosts as hideous monsters, Choo Mantar takes the old-school route to scare people. Despite the valiant performances of Meghana Gaonkar and Aditi Prabhudeva, the movie doesn\u2019t grip you with fear.\n\nALSO READ:Finding Bengaluru in Kannada cinema\n\nIt\u2019s confusing why director Navaneeth treats the film as a thriller. Every plot point in the story leads to a surprise. While such twists aren\u2019t bad, Choo Mantar fails to do the basic duty of a horror film: to scare the audience. The movie is well mounted with the cinematography and the background score doing justice to the backdrop. The rousing climax is whistle-worthy but feels force-fitted to produce an impact similar to what we experienced in Kantara (2022).\n\nI enjoyed the final surprise, a nod to a yesteryear horror hit involving a superstar. Sharan\u2019s character, in fact, has a lot of similarities to that famous character from the popular movie. Though gimmicky, the sequel idea feels quite juicy to think of, especially if you consider the probability of a horror universe in Kannada cinema. In case there is a continuation, the franchise must have a perfect balance of suspense and horrifying drama.\n\nChoo Mantar is currently running in cricket"

            "article_content": "San Francisco: Close to two months ago, 26-year-old OpenAI Whistleblower, Suchir Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment under mysterious circumstances; while initially his death was termed as a suicide, his family and some investigative journalists believe it to be a murder. Suchir Balaji's mother, Poornima Rao, in a recent interview, has claimed that her son was not okay with OpenAI becoming \u2018for-profit\u2019. Her interview has been reshared by Elon Musk who has also reacted to it amid his feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\n\u2018He Was Not Okay with OpenAI Becoming For-Profit\u2019: Suchir Balaji's Mother\n\nPoornima Rao, Suchir Balaji's mother who has been raising her voice against OpenAI and claiming her son's death to be a murder, has recently made shocking claims in a fresh interview. In a conversation with Mario Nawfal, the OpenAI whistleblower's mother said that her son had joined OpenAI with the belief to help humanity and was not okay with the organisation becoming for-profit.\n\nSuchir Balaji's mother said, \u201cThe reason he joined OpenAI was his belief that AI will help humanity. He was very impressed with OpenAI initially because they were nonprofit. That's when his concern started to arise, and he started questioning himself.\u201d\n\nElon Musk Reshares Interview of Suchir Balaji's Mother, Reacts To Her Shocking Claims\n\nPoornima Rao's interview clip where she is claiming that her son was not happy with OpenAI becoming for-profit, reached Elon Musk as well who shared it on \u2018X\u2019 (formerly known as Twitter). Along with the reshare, he reacted to it with two exclamation marks, \u2018!!\u2019.\n\n\u2018Suchir Balaji Was A Genius\u2019: OpenAI Whistleblower's Mother\n\nIn the same interview, Suchir Balaji's mother talked about how her son was a genius. She said, \u201cWhen he was in high school, for 2 years, every weekend, day and night, he was practicing algorithms. He downloaded data related to machine learning from many different universities. Way before anyone else knew about AI, he was already a champion in machine learning and algorithms. At the age of 11, he started programming. Within 6 months, he used to ask me questions that I could not answer on algorithms.\u201d\n\n\u2018No Acknowledgement from OpenAI of His Contributions\u2019\n\nIn her interview, Suchir Balaji's mother also expressed her sadness because OpenAI never recognised or appreciated her son for his work and contribution to the company, not even after his unfortunate death. She said, \u201cHe did something to fine-tune ChatGPT that made it faster and more efficient. But what bothered him was that there was no recognition for his work until he passed away. Even now, there's no acknowledgement from OpenAI of his contributions. That's very unfortunate.\u201d\n\nSuchir Balaji's Mother Alleges Murder of Her Son\n\nAmid reports about Suchir Balaji Death Case being a suicide, the 26-year-old boy's mother Poornima Rao has claimed her son's death to be a \u2018cold-blooded murder declared by authorities as suicide\u2019. She further claimed that there was a stark difference between the initial police report and a private autopsy report, that her son's apartment was ransacked and that there were signs of struggle in the bathroom suggesting he was hit and this is not a suicide, but a case of murder.\n\n\u2018This Doesn\u2019t Seems A Suicide': Elon Musk\n\nBillionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has responded to the plea made by the mother of OpenAi Whistleblower Suchir Balaji saying that, \u201cThis doesn't seems a suicide\u201d, in which she called for an FBI investigation following her son's death. Balaji accused the AI gaint of copyright violations, and he was found dead a month after the allegations surfaced.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, his mother, Poornima Ramarao, revealed that they had hired a private investigator and conducted a second autopsy to further investigate the cause of death. According to Ramarao, the private autopsy did not confirm the police's conclusion. In her post, she tagged billionaire Elon Musk and Indian-American tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, both of whom will join the incoming Donald Trump administration and are key ally of president-elect. Mr. Musk, known for his ongoing feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, replied to her post, stating, \u201cThis doesn't seem like a suicide.\u201d\n\nSuchir Balaji Case: Controversy Surrounding Indian-American's Death\n\nIndian-American tech researcher Suchir Balaji, 26, who openly criticized the use of copyrighted data in artificial intelligence (AI), was found dead in his San Francisco apartment. Balaji, a computer science graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, had interned with OpenAI and Scale AI during his college years. He joined OpenAI in 2019 and during his four years at the company, he worked on several projects, including GPT-4 training and improving ChatGPT\u2019s performance. He left OpenAI in August this year, expressing concerns over the potential harm OpenAI could cause. During his tenure, he played a significant role in data collection for OpenAI's flagship product, ChatGPT. On his personal website, Mr. Balaji elaborated on his concerns, claiming that OpenAI's method of copying data for training its models potentially amounted to copyright infringement.\n\nJust a day before his death, Balaji\u2019s name was mentioned in a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI. Though details about his involvement remain unclear, his public criticism of the company\u2019s data usage practices likely drew attention to his stance on ethical AI development. Suchir Balaji had accused OpenAI of training its AI models on copyrighted material scraped from the internet without proper authorization, a practice he argued was detrimental. \"If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,\" Mr. Balaji said in an interview with The New York Times earlier this year. The Indian-origin tech professional resigned from OpenAI in October 2023 after nearly four years with the company."

More info\n\nWith staycations steadily becoming a thing of the past, experts pinpointed the cheapest hidden gems across Europe that offer return flights for under \u00a375. Money-saving experts at Savoo delved into the details of upcoming flights and travel trends for 2025 to find the cheapest flights, and the top tips for getting your holiday in under budget.\n\nSpain\n\nDespite holding some of the most popular cities for Brits to vacay in, Spain earned not one but two spots on the list of cheapest return prices. In first place is the seaside Costa del Sol, with return flights going as low as \u00a351.\n\nIt takes roughly the same amount of time to fly to Costa del Sol from London as it does to get you to Manchester via train, only with a hefty price difference as the money-saving experts noted an average one-way train up north costs \u00a354.50. Mallorca also made the list with potential return flights from \u00a362 if you pick your times and dates right.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nOne of the more high profile destinations on the list is the capital city of the Czech Republic, Prague, with return flights starting at \u00a357. Including average hotel prices, cheap and mid-range food to keep you going as well as some beers and coffees over a weekend trip will set you back \u00a3254.27 according to the money experts.\n\nPoland\n\nKrakow comes in third place at \u00a359.50 for return flights and the alternative in Warsaw has a slightly higher premium at \u00a364.30. But both areas also earned a spot on Savoo\u2019s cheapest long weekend getaways in second at \u00a3231.57 and third place with \u00a3242.60 respectively including hotels, food and drinks.\n\nSlovakia\n\nRounding out the top five is Barislava in Slovakia with \u00a363.40 return flights available. The historic city also came in just under Prague for the cheapest weekend getaway, costing roughly \u00a3267.89 for three days and two nights.\n\nFinally, Budapest in Hungary, Vilnius in Lithuania, Riga in Latvia and Lisbon in Portugal rounded out the latter part of the top 10 with return flights ranging between \u00a365 and \u00a371. The experts warned that while hidden gems and lesser-known destinations like Bratislava are likely to have cheaper flights all-year round, there are some ways to bag a bargain on even the most popular tourist destinations.\n\nThe experts shared their top five money-saving tips while booking flights. Starting with the most obvious in avoiding popular dates like Fridays or school holidays when trips are likely to be more expensive due to increased demand.\n\nIf you can be even more flexible with dates, the experts recommended: \u201cLast-minute deals can save you a ton of money. So if you\u2019re brave, try to hold off booking until a couple of weeks before you want to go.\u201d\n\nJust like avoiding popular travel dates, avoiding the popular airports can save some change for your getaway. The experts explained: \u201cConsider an airport close by. For example, if you\u2019re headed to Orlando, you don\u2019t just need to fly into Orlando International Airport. Both Melbourne and Tampa have airports with flights from the UK, which can cost a lot less.\u201d\n\nLayovers generally tend to be cheaper than direct flights, up to 50% in some cases, they claimed, although it is more time-consuming. Using voucher codes, discounts and comparison sites can also earn back some cash for your trip.\n\nOne subtle way to ensure you\u2019re not getting priced out of a getaway is to look for flights using an incognito mode browser tab, the experts recommended. This avoids installing permanent cookies on your browser so you\u2019re less likely to be shown inflated prices sometimes given to people who are consistently browsing some flights."

X (formerly Twitter) has introduced specific labels for parody accounts on its platform.\n\nThe new labeling system will require parody account holders to explicitly identify themselves as such in their account names and bios. To further enhance clarity, X will add a visible label to these accounts, ensuring users can recognise their nature.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re rolling out profile labels for parody accounts to clearly distinguish these types of accounts and their content on our platform. We designed these labels to increase transparency and to ensure that users are not deceived into thinking such accounts belong to the entity being parodied,\u201d X\u2019s Safety team said.\n\nCurrently, users can voluntarily add the label to their profiles on X\u2019s settings page. However, the platform intends to make these labels mandatory for parody, commentary, and fan (PCF) accounts in the future.\n\nX also said that users cannot use manufactured identities to engage in disruptive or deceptive behavior. This may include using stock, stolen or AI-generated profile photos, copied or stolen profile bios, and/or misleading profile information for the purpose of deceiving others."

The offers on each coupon page are updated every few days to ensure we feature the freshest ways to save, and our commercial team (based in London) also sources exclusive codes and sales info directly from some of the biggest retailers around.\n\nHow we test coupon codes\n\nAll the coupon codes we list on our pages have been tested by our deals & offers teams to check they work as intended before they\u2019ve been uploaded. You\u2019ll find a wide range of coupons on Tom\u2019s Guide, including free shipping offers, student discounts, and savings on various kinds of products.\n\nTo ensure that all listed codes are available to use, we don\u2019t include any one-time use or user-specific coupons. We also provide as much information as we can to keep things as clear as possible - any expiry dates or terms & conditions will be listed alongside the code.

However, although we keep up to date with expiry dates and any terms & conditions, sometimes retailers change these before we can update our pages.\n\nShould a coupon fail to work as expected, check you meet any listed requirements. These can include minimum spends, multibuy offers, or product-specific promotions (i.e. 10% off selected tablets). You can view all associated requirements by clicking \u201cView terms and conditions\u201d below your code.\n\nIf this does not solve your issue, you can contact our customer service team by emailing coupons.tomsguide@futurenet.com. Make sure to let us know which coupon you were trying to use and which page this was listed on, and we\u2019ll be in touch to help as soon as possible.\n\nHow we make money\n\nTom\u2019s Guide makes money from coupons through a commission-based model. We have agreements in place with each retailer on our site - for every purchase made using one of our coupons or deals, we earn a small percentage of the order total back in commission.\n\nThanks to this model, we can save our customers money without charging them a thing. You won\u2019t pay a penny to get the discounts listed on our pages, so whichever code or deal you choose, you\u2019ll get exactly what it says on the tin."

            "article_content": "FAQs\n\nCan you pay with Crypto at CDKeys? Absolutely, CDKeys accepts a number of cryptocurrencies. They also have been known to offer exclusive deals for payments made with specific cryptocurrencies.\n\nHow does CDKeys work? Instead of sending you a physical copy of the game, CDKeys sends you a \u2018key\u2019, which is a product code/serial number for the game you\u2019re purchasing. You then use the key to activate the game.\n\nHow long does it take for CDKeys to send the code? Not long at all! You should receive your code straight after you\u2019ve made your payment so there\u2019s no waiting around! You\u2019ll get your key on your CDKeys account as well as your email address.\n\nHow do I contact CDKeys? You can get in touch with the CDKeys customer service team by either sending them an email at support@cdkeys.com or calling the team at +1 (855) 534-4806.

You can only get a refund at CDKeys if you haven\u2019t opened your code and you\u2019re requesting a refund within 7 days of purchase. Your refund will be sent to your original payment method, and it can take up to 10 business days to show the refund on your bank statement.\n\nWhat are CDKoins? CDKoins are CDkeys version of a rewards program. If you have an account with CDkeys you'll receive CDKoins for every purchase made which can be redeemed for a discount on your next purchase.\n\nHints and tips\n\nShop the Daily Deals: The dedicated \u2018Daily Deals\u2019 section is exactly what it says it is - daily deals! Here you\u2019ll find a collection of games with a price cut for one day only, and you\u2019ll often find big discounts like 30% off. The Daily Deals section sometimes has offers for pre-order games, which gives you a chance to get them at a lower price than the release date.\n\nBrowse the sale: CDKeys loves a good sale, and there\u2019s always one running throughout the year. The sale includes games for PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch, so whatever your preferred way of gaming, you can pick up a bargain in the CDKeys sale. It\u2019s also worth checking the website during key seasonal events like Black Friday as there\u2019s bound to be some huge price cuts if past years are anything to go by!\n\nSign up for the newsletter: Guess what? You don\u2019t have to go onto the CDKeys website to find an offer, you can get the offers to come to you when you sign up for the newsletter! Not only will you find out about the latest deals, but you\u2019ll also find out about upcoming releases and news.\n\nFollow CDKeys on social media: Make sure to follow CDKeys on social media to never miss out on a deal or saving.

This will make a pop-out box appear, showing the code. 3) Copy the code by clicking on the \u2018Copy\u2019 button, then head to the website. 4) Once you have everything, head to the shopping cart. Click \u2018Secure Checkout\u2019 when you\u2019re on the shopping cart page and scroll down the page until you see the \u2018Discount Code\u2019 text. 5) Click on the arrow next to the text to reveal a box. Paste your code in the box that says \u2018Enter Discount Code\u2019 and then click \u2018Apply Discount\u2019.\n\nHow we source coupon codes\n\nAll the codes you see on PC Gamer have been sourced by our dedicated coupons team. Using our affiliate networks, partnerships with brands, and the world wide web, we track down the latest and best coupon codes and ways to save on your online orders. Our pages are updated multiple times a week, and our commercial team also uses their connections to negotiate exclusive codes with big name brands, so you can find all the best available codes and promotions listed in one place.\n\nHow we test coupon codes\n\nTo ensure that every code you see is ready to use, our team tests each one before uploading it to a page. Whether it's for free shipping, a multibuy offer, a student discount, or savings in the sales, we check that the code can be applied at the checkout and works as described. We don\u2019t include any one-time or user-specific codes, so you haven\u2019t got to worry about anyone else beating you to the punch, and you\u2019ll find codes for products across all kinds of categories.\n\nWe also include all the information about a coupon, such as terms and conditions and the expiry date, on the page below the offer description. Simply click \u2018Terms & Conditions\u2019 and you\u2019ll expand the code box, where you\u2019ll be able to read any specific instructions or requirements associated with your chosen coupon. We do our best to update this information whenever any changes are made, with each page checked at least twice a week.\n\nWhat to do if a coupon code doesn\u2019t work\n\nDespite our best efforts, sometimes coupons won\u2019t work as expected. Expiry dates and terms and conditions can be changed by the retailer, or the code may simply no longer be accepted. Should you run into any issues, don\u2019t worry - our customer service team is available to offer support.\n\nThe first port of call should always be to check the coupon\u2019s terms and conditions to make sure you meet all requirements. Codes may be product-specific (i.e. 5% off gaming laptops), require a minimum order value (i.e. when you spend $50 or more), or need you to verify your status (i.e. verify with a valid military email address). Click the \u2018terms & conditions\u2019 text below the \u2018Get Code\u2019 button to view all available information.\n\nIf you\u2019re still having issues once you\u2019ve confirmed that you meet the necessary requirements, you can get in touch with our team by sending an email to coupons.pcgamer@futurenet.com. Include a summary of which code you tried to use, where you found it, and what went wrong, and we\u2019ll reply as soon as we can to help out.\n\nHow we make money\n\nPC Gamer earns money from its coupon pages through a commission model. We have deals in place with every retailer that has a corresponding coupon page on our site. When you shop with one of these retailers and use one of our codes to get a discount, the brand will pay us a percentage of the final order total in commission.\n\nUsing this model means that redeeming a discount through PC Gamer never costs you a thing. We don\u2019t charge any fees to apply a code, and all our money is made directly from retailers, not our audience. You\u2019ll only ever pay for the products or services you buy, with lower prices just as they\u2019re described on the page."

Los Angeles won six away games this season, a fact that appears to be baked into the spread.\n\nThe Chargers, who rebounded from last season\u2019s last-place finish in the AFC West, led the NFL in scoring defense during the regular season, at 17.7 points per game. Justin Herbert has passed for 10 TDs and no interceptions in his past eight road starts. He finished the regular season strong, passing for two-plus TDs in four consecutive games.\n\nThe Texans dropped two consecutive games, to the Ravens and Chiefs, before closing the regular season with a meaningless win over Tennessee. Baltimore held Houston to two points in the Week 17 loss. In his past five games, C.J. Stroud has not passed for 250 yards, while totaling six TD passes during that span. In three of his past four games, Joe Mixon failed to rush for 30 yards.\n\nIf I were signing up for this FanDuel new user promo I\u2019d make my first bet on the Chargers to cover. Herbert is rolling into the postseason and the Los Angeles defense will certainly hold Stroud down."

            "source": "CNET",
            "article_content": "Though it sometimes feels like everyone's following the same trend (AI), the technology we saw at CES 2025 was remarkably diverse, from practical devices for your home to mind-bogglingly powerful laptops to the next revolutions in health tech.\n\nSome of the concepts at CES might come years in the future (or never), while many other products are available for sale right now. Here are the six biggest trends from CES that we think will make the largest impact in 2025.\n\nIf you're looking for the very top products from the trade show, be sure to check out the official 2025 Best of CES Awards, selected by the CNET Group.\n\nRobots keep getting better, smarter, cuter, smaller and creepier\n\nMost of the non-novelty robots shown at CES bear a functional resemblance to the robots used commercially -- by that I mean you can tell they're the product of the same research in movement and AI as they pick things up, fold, clean and so on. Expensive models like Mi-Mo, Beatbot, R2D3 and more.\n\nSamsung's yellow Ballie home robot is going to ship this year. James Martin/CNET\n\nMore consumer-friendly models were less functional, like the tiny, fuzzy bots that you hang on your handbag as a fashion statement or the adorable model with huge anime eyes that follows you around on wheels but seems like a surveillance nightmare (the TCL AI Me). There were also the concepts of yesteryear that finally edged toward saleability, such as Samsung's Ballie -- a spherical bot with a projector in its belly, like a baby Teletubbie.\n\nWatch this: Sorry, There Are No 'Best Robots' at CES This Year 03:22\n\nOn the \"whut?\" front perches a tiny robot whose function is simply to blow on hot beverages.\n\nBut the models that resonated the most with us were home helpers that don't cost tens of thousands of dollars, like Roborock's Saros Z70 robot vacuum cleaner -- it sports an arm that can pick up your socks -- or Eureka's J15 Max Ultra, which detects spills and untangles its own brushes. And one of the most innovative was the Lymow One, a robot mower that cuts the grass and feeds mulched matter back to your lawn. There's always a ton of laundry robots -- unsurprising given how much everyone hates laundry -- like Tenet's AI Laundry Robot, which washes and folds.\n\nAnd we can't forget the token \"most human-looking\" robot, Realbotix's $175K Aria robot, which is designed for \"companionship and intimacy\" -- and looks it, given she's built along the lines of an old-school Barbie.\n\nUltimately, we chose not to pick a best robot because of how removed they were from interaction. In fact, many of the expensive models were in more of a zoo environment: Look at the magical creature in its habitat, repeatedly picking things up and moving them elsewhere. That's the kind of thing we've been seeing for years.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nNvidia doesn't make robots, but it's been working on its robot LLMs and operating systems for years. And every time Nvidia trots out this visual at its events, I can't help but think that Nvidia is building a robot army. Well, that and Metropolis.\n\nAI inside, again, but more powerful\n\nThere seemed to be less hype about AI in devices (though it's possible I have successfully learned to tune it out), but about the same in mobile apps like Delta's AI concierge. However, it was everywhere in laptops thanks to the annual chip updates from Intel and AMD -- which of course brought the usual faster, better and improved battery life -- plus bundles of \"try it!\" software for your out-of-the-box AI experience.\n\nWatch this: Everything Announced at Nvidia's CES Event in 12 Minutes 11:47\n\nBut in this respect, Nvidia stole the show for its Cosmos AI model (Nvidia has been working on and licensing its various models for autonomous cars, robots and more for years, but this seemed to be its biggest \"moment\"), as well as its unveiling of the newest generation of consumer graphics.\n\nRead more: Nvidia Hands-Down Won AI at CES 2025, and Also the Show Itself. Here's Why That Matters\n\nThe GeForce RTX 50 series not only promises the typical performance bump PC gamers expect, but thanks to the new Blackwell generation of GPUs, it brings more powerful and better generative AI capabilities down to your local system. That means cheaper entry for developers, the ability for end users to run bigger models, as well speed improvements (via Nvidia's DLSS 4) and more sophisticated capabilities for games.\n\nWatch this: These New Smart Glasses Want to Be Your Next AI Companion 02:31\n\nThere weren't a lot of new smart glasses, but Halliday's stood out for the way they present information: Rather than on the screen, they have a tiny monochrome display that shows text.\n\nRead more: Commentary: The Smart Glasses Moment Is Here. But They're Still Missing Something Big\n\nThe big AI news for cars at CES wasn't, for once, autonomininity: It was Volkswagen bringing ChatGPT to its voice assistant for more complex, natural-language help.\n\nRead more: Nvidia's CEO Explains How Its New AI Models Could Work on Future Smart Glasses\n\nCouch potato 'tainment\n\nOne of CES' core pillars is entertainment (it used to be baked right into the name), which generally means TVs and audio. There weren't any new screen technologies, but there were improvements and innovations with existing ones.\n\nThe suction cups on the back of the Displace TV James Martin/CNET\n\nTweaks to OLED came to TVs, with LG's G5 OLED's quality bump impressing us the most for its better brightness and contrast, along with HiSense's 116-inch MicroLED model. But the TV that seemed to make the biggest impact on us were Displace's hang-anywhere-thanks-to-huge-suction-cups TVs, shipping versions of prototypes we've seen in past years.\n\nWatch this: Displace TV's 55-Inch Television Hangs From a Wall Using Suction Cups 03:15\n\nI think its impact was partly due to the enormous opportunity for \"suck\" puns.\n\nThere was the usual complement of gaming desktops, laptops and monitors, the latter offering the typical year upgrade to higher refresh rates (500Hz and 600Hz).\n\nWatch this: Lenovo's New Legion Go S Gaming Handheld Is Lighter and Smaller but Packs a Big Surprise 03:30\n\nBut the biggest hit was Lenovo's new handheld console. The company is the first to offer (or at least announce) a SteamOS-based model, one of the new Legion G S models. Acer's Nitro Blaze 11 gaming handheld, however, earned some mockery, because you can't really respect a \"handheld\" if it's bigger than your head.\n\nRead more: Commentary: The Time for an Xbox Handheld Is Now\n\nBut it was also kind of hard to sustain excitement about gaming hardware at CES this year, because of a shiny new thing possibly on the horizon. Rumors say the Nintendo Switch 2 is coming soon.\n\nHealth and beauty, the staples of CES\n\nSometimes I think CES specializes in sleep, skin and smart rings, plus technology designed to make you feel like a loser -- so many smart mirrors, though none yet use generative AI to simulate your mother's critical voice or to show you what you could look like if you just tried harder. But maybe that's just me.\n\nThere may not have been as many this year, but there were some standouts. Withing's Omnia smart mirror combines a scale and a mirror to not only tell you if you're overweight and in bad health, but to show you as well. There's always a device for analyzing your skin to tell you what to buy to fix it, such as L'Oreal's BioPrint. (To be fair, I don't know what it's suggestions are.)\n\nWatch this: I Said Yes to Trying a Smart Ring You Can Propose With 01:45\n\nAnd, oh, the rings. One way to attract attention among the plethora of rings designed to monitor your health is to make it gold and platinum, like the UltraHuman Rare ring: Nothing's more romantic than a ring that says, \"Marry me\" and \"Please don't die,\" simultaneously. Or alternatively, \"Show me off on Instagram.\"\n\nDon't forget the annual dose of flatware that makes you healthier. This year's entrant is Kirin Electric Salt Spoon, intended to give you that salty taste without any of the nasty sodium -- by zapping your tongue with a bit of electricity. On the other hand, if they could do that for chocolate, I'd be first in line.\n\nLisa Eadicicco/CNET\n\nAnd while the Nike x Hyperice's \"boatlike booties are basically recovery high-tops festooned with buttons and designed to help your weary tootsies recover from soreness and strain,\" they sound pretty awesome.\n\nBut there were some truly practical and innovative new products, like the Ozlo Sleepbuds, which stay in, are flush with your ears for side sleepers and have sensors and other tech to help improve the quality of your sleep. Our team also called out the YoctoMat, a smart yoga mat that provides feedback on your poses. And while I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as health or beauty, in the interest of hydration, the Roam SodaTop is a bottle cap with a CO2 cartridge so you can carbonate your water on the go.\n\nHome is where the heat is\n\nHome tech tends to cover a lot of bases, many of them robotic. No one really likes to vacuum, do laundry or mow the lawn like the AI-driven robot vacuums and lawnmower I mentioned above.\n\nRead more: Commentary I Really Don't Want an AI Pot to Turn My Plant Into a Tamagotchi From Hell\n\nVideo smart locks seemed to be the focus of home security upgrades this year -- we call out Lockly's Vision Prestige and TCLs Smart Lock D1 Ultra -- providing more information than existing models. Notable, also, because someone breaking in doesn't use the video doorbell.\n\n23 Fascinating Home Tech Gadgets We Saw at CES 2025, the Biggest Tech Show on Earth +21 More See all photos\n\nCooling and heating were hot as well, especially Samsung's DHS Mono R32 HT heat pump, which heats outside air, condenses it to water and feeds it to your water tank. As an apartment dweller, I'm partial to the Gradient All-Weather 120V Window Heat Pump, which supplies heat when the weather gets frosty. Cooling and heating go hand-in-hand with utility bills and power backup -- I was really intrigued by the BioLite, which provides battery backup for a couple of key appliances, like the refrigerator.\n\nAnd Savant's Smart Budget is designed to save you money by routing power automatically (and manually) to balance output, thereby potentially saving you the expense of rewiring your home to support new, power-sucking devices. Plus, Aqara introduced the Touchscreen Dial V1, a clever and useful dial that can control all your smart devices\n\nAnd lest we forget the bread-and-butter of small appliances. There are always plenty, though really it's the oddballs and gimmicks that catch more attention than the mundane. This year, we saw the phone-controlled Panasonic HomeChef 4-in-1 Multi-Oven, the Apecoo tortilla and roti maker (food samples really seemed to attract us), LG's \"Perfect Fancy Microwave for Social Media\" with a 27-inch display and much, much more.\n\nThe future and the future's future\n\nThe big deals for cars (and other things that tote people) tend to be new technologies and other future-flung concepts. BMW gave us panoramic IDrive with operating system X, a three-tier, ultra wide holographic 3D windshield display that's actually not too far out from your next BMW, and Hyundai Mobis holographic windshield display one-ups it by constraining the angle of view to the driver.\n\nWatch this: Aptera Solar EV Gets All the Energy It Needs From the Sun 04:45\n\nWe see flying cars at the show every year, but sadly we're no closer to me getting one. This year's concept-du-jour was the Xpeng AeroHT, a massive six-wheeler with an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle in its trunk. Aptera's solar EV isn't a flying car, but it really looks like it should have wings.\n\nThe Pebble Flow Electric RV concept -- solar chargeable -- came back for a visit, as did Sony's Afeela, and the latter is ready for your money, if not delivery. Honda trotted out prototypes of its 0 series EVs (one step closer to reality than the concept we saw last year), a sports sedan and a van. See the new photos.\n\nBut a new motor concept claims to vastly increase the range of EVs -- arguably more important than all the shiny paint and glowy dashboards.\n\nGeoffrey Morrison/CNET\n\nAnother concept that appealed to me personally was Nanosys' next-gen MicroLED, dubbed UV LED, which uses ultraviolet light to energize RGB quantum dots to precise frequencies: Different lIght frequencies are how we perceive color. MicroLED may potentially supplant OLED in big screens and small. It somewhat upstaged Samsung's MicroLED watch concept with an uber-bright screen. Samsung also brought us a somewhat disturbing-looking stretchable screen for a 3D-ish view and a transparent MicroLED screen. Lenovo's concept ThinkBook with a rollable screen looks and gesture controls appear sleek.\n\nIn a class by itself, the Flint Paper Battery claims to be a new, sustainable power source that may eventually replace lithium ion with cellulose.\n\nWatch this: I Made Things Weird Trying TSA's New Shoe Scanner Machine 03:53\n\nFinally, I will never forget Bridget Carey smuggling Gummy Worms in her shoe to test TSA's new scanner -- after complaining about the ick factor of shuffling our socks or bare soles across a floor that's had thousands of other shoes scrape across it. Gummy Worms in your shoe has a pretty high ick factor, too."

            "article_content": "Tomorrow\u2019s workplace will see the proliferation of automation, robots, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Data will go from big to colossal, and video-enabled collaboration will push teams further, faster. Exponential technological growth is changing work as we know it forever; yet key values endure.\n\nAI\u2019s transformative technology will solve complex problems and enhance human capabilities across industries, yet it must be responsibly developed. AI is not only a technology challenge, it\u2019s a leadership opportunity. This is what business schools must focus on every day: How can we best prepare students for responsible leadership? How can we prepare them to lead others into the unknown and to create value and positive change in a world of new driving forces, including AI?\n\nActive learning\n\nThe best preparation for future action is active learning. The Socratic method, complemented by the case study method, builds leadership capacity at a higher and faster rate than other methods of learning. In 2000 BCE, Socrates strolled through Athens\u2019 agora (marketplace) and shared his belief that true wisdom comes not from having all of the answers but in knowing how to ask the right questions. Questions peel away layers of assumption, encourage dialogue, make room for curiosity and innovation and require a strong dose of humility. This timeless posture of learning through questions \u2014 the Socratic Method \u2014 strengthens the muscle of critical thinking and develops the skills of collaboration and communication.\n\nThere are few business schools in the world that use the Socratic method and even fewer that underpin it with the case study method. Here\u2019s how it works: Faculty do not deliver lectures while students take notes. Instead, learners engage in active and experiential learning.\n\nIn the case study method, MBA students examine hundreds of real-life business case studies, replete with challenges and twists. They review these cases with their teams and come to class prepared to express their own formulated ideas and arguments and to apply their knowledge. Ethics, innovation and sustainability are themes woven across the curriculum. Up to 50% of a student\u2019s grade comes from participating in classroom conversation. The faculty orchestrate this symphony of ideas, opinion, debate and feedback, ensuring that the students learn not just from the professor but from each other.\n\nBuild leadership\n\nStudents also evaluate their purpose and articulate their values. They join learning teams and take on leadership positions in student organisations. Student self-governance means that students aren\u2019t just passengers; they are co-pilots. This interactive learning model teaches learners to solve problems with imperfect information, and to speak persuasively and confidently. Putting the learner in the role of the general manager builds leadership capacity and prepares them for the work they will be hired to do: to make recommendations for action.\n\nThe writer is Dean of the University of Virginia Darden School of Business."

            "article_content": "The collapse of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria has alarmed many regional countries, including the UAE and Egypt - but Israel is particularly concerned by this development.\n\nAn Israeli government committee has even suggested that a Syria ruled by Sunni Islamists who don\u2019t recognise Israel\u2019s right to exist could potentially pose a bigger threat to the country than Iran, Israel\u2019s archenemy.\n\nThe committee was particularly unnerved by Turkey\u2019s influence in Syria, claiming that Ankara could use the new Syrian government as a proxy force \u201cto restore the Ottoman Crown to its former glory\u201d - whatever that means.\n\nThe report noted that Ankara could rapidly rearm the new Syrian government, potentially triggering a direct conflict between Israel and Turkey.\n\nBut is this a realistic scenario? In short, the answer is no.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nAlthough Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has gradually weakened Turkish-Israeli bilateral relations - cutting trade ties, denying air travel to senior Israeli officials, accusing Tel Aviv of genocide at the International Court of Justice, and delivering fiery populist speeches hinting that the Turkish army could one day aid the Palestinian people - there is no indication that Ankara seeks a military confrontation with Israel.\n\nApart from the fact that both Turkey and Israel are US allies, and the two sides have never engaged in a military conflict, Ankara has no appetite for such adventures - especially while the region is already grappling with an ongoing war between Iran and Israel, alongside the catastrophe unfolding in Gaza.\n\nTurkey's objectives in Syria\n\nTurkey\u2019s aims in Syria are very clear, and they have been communicated both publicly and privately to all actors involved.\n\nFirstly, as Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan noted, Ankara wants a stable Syria that poses no threat to other nations. Secondly, Turkey envisions a democratic, unitary and civil state in Syria - one that embraces minorities and all ethnic groups, while preventing the formation of a Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) statelet.\n\nAfter hosting millions of Syrian refugees for more than a decade and conducting multiple military operations, which have cost Turkish lives and hundreds of millions of dollars, Ankara wants a Syria that can economically and socially flourish. A conflict with Israel, whether direct or indirect, does not align with that goal.\n\nAn Israeli report recently suggested that Tel Aviv prefers a fragmented Syria to safeguard its security interests. This is a mistake\n\nSo far, Turkey\u2019s actions have supported these objectives.\n\nAnkara initially - and to a large extent - turned a blind eye to Israel\u2019s aerial campaign to destroy remnants of the Assad regime\u2019s military facilities. But after Israel expanded its targets significantly, Fidan announced that Turkey had relayed a message to Israel that such attacks must stop.\n\nFidan acknowledged Israeli concerns that arms, such as chemical weapons, could fall into the wrong hands. Notably, Israel has avoided striking any Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) targets.\n\nFurthermore, Turkey has reportedly taken the first steps to establish a deconfliction mechanism with the Israeli military in Syria. Reports also point to routine engagements between Turkish and Israeli intelligence agencies.\n\nIn addition, according to my sources, Ankara has encouraged HTS leaders, including Ahmed al-Sharaa, to issue statements advocating calm with Israel. Several HTS figures have publicly said they are not seeking a clash with Israel.\n\nRisks of fragmentation\n\nMeanwhile, according to my Turkish contacts, there are indications that Damascus may seek to engage Ankara militarily, potentially moving Turkish advisers to Syrian military academies and airbases, to help re-establish a unified Syrian army under the Syrian defence ministry.\n\nTurkey is mindful of Israeli concerns regarding such cooperation. What I hear is that Turkey's deployments will be limited. They would not go beyond Hama and, to some extent, Damascus - an effort to reassure Israel that Ankara\u2019s actions are not hostile.\n\nBut Israel must come to terms with the fact that Ankara will not tolerate a PKK-controlled statelet in northern Syria. Turkey has consistently insisted that Kurdish groups must be integrated into a unified Syrian state.\n\nIsrael\u2019s attacks on Syria threaten regional stability and will ultimately backfire Read More \u00bb\n\nAn Israeli report recently suggested that Tel Aviv prefers a fragmented Syria to safeguard its security interests. This is a mistake.\n\nAnother report in Israel Hayom this week also talked about Israel's plan for an international conference to divide Syria into canons.\n\nA fragmented Syria would be a breeding ground for armed groups, further destabilising the region and creating long-term risks for Israel. By contrast, a democratic and inclusive Syria serves everyone\u2019s interests.\n\nUnfortunately, it is clear that Israel\u2019s leadership prefers dealing with autocratic regimes, which are more transactional and reliable in their oppressive policies - making Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and the occupied West Bank easier to justify and swallow.\n\nIt is true that Turkey now has a friend in Damascus. Erdogan stands to benefit from this relationship on multiple fronts: domestically, economically and regionally.\n\nBut this does not mean that the new Syrian government will become a Turkish proxy. On the contrary, if fortune is on our side, Syria will - for the first time - have a legitimate administration focused on one thing only: rebuilding the country as a place of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye."

            "article_content": "While it's still too early for an accurate tally of the financial toll, the losses so far likely make the wildfires the costliest ever in the U.S., according to various estimates.\n\nThe devastating blazes have killed at least 11 people and incinerated more than 12,000 structures since Tuesday, laying waste to entire neighborhoods once home to multimillion-dollar properties.\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The wildfires that erupted this week across Los Angeles County are still raging, but already are projected to be among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.\n\nA preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. By comparison, AccuWeather estimated the damage and economic losses caused by Hurricane Helene, which tore across six southeastern states last fall, at $225 billion to $250 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis will be the costliest wildfire in California modern history and also very likely the costliest wildfire in U.S. modern history, because of the fires occurring in the densely populated areas around Los Angeles with some of the highest-valued real estate in the country,\u201d said Jonathan Porter, the private firm\u2019s chief meteorologist.\n\nGet Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nAccuWeather factors in a multitude of variables in its estimates, including damage to homes, businesses, infrastructure and vehicles, as well as immediate and long-term health care costs, lost wages and supply chain interruptions.\n\nThe aftermath of the Palisades Fire in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles on Saturday. John Locher/Associated Press\n\nThe insurance broker Aon PLC also said Friday that the L.A. County wildfires will likely end up being the costliest in U.S. history, although it did not issue an estimate. Aon ranks a wildfire known as the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, in 2018 as the costliest in U.S. history up to now at $12.5 billion, adjusted for inflation. The Camp Fire killed 85 people and destroyed about 11,000 homes.\n\nThe L.A. County wildfires, which were fueled by hurricane-force Santa Ana winds and an extreme drought, remained largely uncontained Saturday. That means the final tally of losses from the blazes is likely to increase, perhaps substantially.\n\n\u201cTo put this into perspective, the total damage and economic loss from this wildfire disaster could reach nearly 4% of the annual GDP of the state of California,\u201d AccuWeather's Porter said.\n\nIn a report Friday, Moody's also concluded that the wildfires would prove to be the costliest in U.S. history, specifically because they have ripped through densely populated areas with higher-end properties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the state is no stranger to major wildfires, they have generally been concentrated in inland areas that are not densely populated. That's led to less destruction per acre, and in damage to less expensive homes, Moody's noted.\n\nThat\u2019s far from the case this time, with one of the largest conflagrations destroying thousands of properties across the Pacific Palisades and Malibu, home to many Hollywood stars and executives with multimillion-dollar properties. Already, numerous celebrities have lost homes to the fires.\n\n\u201cThe scale and intensity of the blazes, combined with their geographic footprint, suggest a staggering price tag, both in terms of the human cost and the economic toll,\u201d Moody's analysts wrote. The report did not include a preliminary cost estimate of the wildfire damage.\n\nIt could be several months before a concrete tally of the financial losses from the wildfires will be possible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the very early stages of this disaster,\u201d Porter said."

What they describe is uncannily similar to the reconstructions of Homo floresiensis.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"It's a very small bodied, physically primitive member of the homo group.\"\n\nHe noted that the way the locals spoke about the Homo floresiensis species was not as if they were talking about a 'spirit' or a 'belief', rather an actual sighting.\n\n\"The descriptions all had a fixed form: it varied, as you would expect from different observers, but at the same time, all the different accounts lent plausibility to this idea there might be some kind of natural species,\" he continued.\n\nLocals are convinced that they've witnessed the species up close (Getty Stock Images)\n\nAdvert\n\n\"Two young men from the UK, as a matter of fact, had been to Flores, mostly on a snorkeling holiday.\n\n\"And they, they climbed a mountain which I'm familiar with, and they claim they saw something that sounded very much like, very much like the ape men.\"\n\nForth's book, Between Ape and Human: An Anthropologist on the Trail of a Hidden Hominoid, tries to examine just why the Lio people were convinced that the tiny, ape-like creatures live among us.\n\nBut if you think that's crazy, Flores is also home to Komodo dragons and the world's largest rat.\n\nAdvert\n\nI think we're all less interested in the rat."

            "article_content": "A flight crew on a private Surjet plane bound for Florida witnessed a bizarre phenomenon while flying over the Bahamas at high altitude. According to the New York Post, the crew - consisting of two pilots and a flight attendant - saw strange, glowing orbs darting around in the night sky, leaving them stunned. The incident occurred on December 23 as they flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane when they received a transmission from Miami air traffic control.\n\nThe flight attendant said she saw the objects appear as white lights in the night sky and transform into green as they observed. Cassandra Martin shared her extraordinary experience with NBC News, revealing that the mysterious object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness.\n\n\"It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it. All of a sudden I heard traffic control say, we have a foreign object, can you please identify it? I looked to the left, and a pilot saw three objects, I only saw one, and I grabbed my phone, I just pressed it to the window to see if I could get a video of what the object was,\" Ms Martin told NBC Miami.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again, and we were about 43, 45 thousand feet and it was way above us,\" she added.\n\nThe object's high altitude and irregular \"zig-zag\" movements, as described by Ms Martin, effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon, respectively.\n\n\"I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is. Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,\" Ms Martin explained."

            "article_content": "The elixir of life: When AI meets genomics\n\nDr. Khaled Walid Mahmoud\n\nThe revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) and genetic engineering represents an unprecedented turning point in human history. By merging digital capabilities with biology, these fields are unlocking the secrets of life and reshaping it in profound ways. Among the leaders in this transformative era is the biotech company Shift Bioscience, which recently secured $16 million in seed funding to support its groundbreaking research on reversing aging. Utilizing generative AI, the company simulates human cells to identify genes capable of rejuvenation, paving the way for treatments aimed at slowing or even reversing the effects of aging.\n\nHowever, this scientific leap forward is intertwined with deeper complexities concerning humanity\u2019s understanding of existence and the boundaries of scientific intervention. Genomics, one of the most intricate sciences, deciphers the DNA code that holds information about our biological history, present, and future. Dubbed the \u201celixir of life,\u201d genomics enables humans to correct genetic mutations that impact health. Yet, it also raises thorny ethical questions about the limits of genetic modification and its implications for human nature itself.\n\nAI excels in tackling the challenges inherent in this complexity. With tools like CRISPR-Cas9, precise genetic modifications can now correct hereditary errors responsible for various diseases. Advanced technologies such as DeepCRISPR and CRISPR-Net enhance the accuracy of these modifications and accelerate scientific breakthroughs. AI not only identifies target genes but also designs guide RNA sequences to ensure precise execution of genetic edits. These extraordinary capabilities are redefining our relationship with our bodies, making it possible to predict future diseases, prevent them, and even improve genetic traits before future generations are born.\n\nDespite these advancements, the scientific revolution is not without its challenges and risks. While scientists pursue the dream of biological immortality, privacy concerns emerge as one of the most significant threats. Genetic data analysis, also known as genetic fingerprinting, reveals the biological secrets of individuals, which could potentially be exploited to develop biological weapons or invade personal privacy. Without robust legal and ethical frameworks, these technologies become a double-edged sword\u2014either enhancing human well-being or exposing humanity to exploitation.\n\nBeyond ethical risks, humanity faces new challenges related to increasing reliance on technology. A notable example is the impact of modern devices like GPS systems on the human brain. Studies show that drivers who rely on these systems experience shrinkage in brain regions responsible for navigation, while those who rely on natural skills maintain the health of these areas. This \u201ctechnological colonization,\u201d which threatens to undermine human capabilities, raises questions about the price we pay for technological progress.\n\nThe ongoing scientific revolution is not merely about technical achievements; it is a test of our ethical and human values. Genetic modification and anti-aging technologies may bring biological immortality closer to reality, but the larger question remains: How do we balance scientific ambition with the preservation of human essence? While AI delves into the \u201cbiological library\u201d within our bodies, humanity bears the responsibility of ensuring these innovations serve, rather than dominate, us.\n\nThis complex question gains urgency as scientific progress accelerates, tempting some to prioritize profit or power over ethics. It is crucial to establish regulatory frameworks to govern the use of genetic data and protect it from misuse. Yet, regulations alone are insufficient; societies need a collective awareness of the importance of balancing technological progress with respect for human values.\n\nAs AI and genetic engineering open unprecedented doors to enhancing and prolonging life, the greatest challenge remains ensuring that these innovations reflect our shared aspiration for a more humane and secure future. Technology, with all its potential, is merely a tool; its true value lies in how it is used to serve humanity.\n\nGenomics stands as humanity\u2019s most ambitious and transformative scientific pursuit\u2014a profound journey to decipher the very code of life and reshape its narrative. In unraveling the mysteries of DNA, we are not merely advancing the boundaries of biology; we are fundamentally redefining what it means to be human. This monumental endeavor holds the promise of becoming the ultimate \u201celixir of life,\u201d capable of curing diseases, extending longevity, and enhancing our existence. Yet, it also carries the weight of profound ethical and societal challenges. The true legacy of genomics will be determined by our capacity to wield its power with wisdom, foresight, and responsibility.\n\nThe writer is a researcher specializing in cyber politics, holding a PhD on the topic of \u201cCyberspace and Power Shifts in International Relations.\u201d"
