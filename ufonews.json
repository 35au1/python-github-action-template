Just like the original game, this bizarre conclusion is unlocked through some very specific actions you carry out during a New Game Plus run.\n\nThe original game had James Sunderland meeting Harry Mason from the first Silent Hill. In this version, James meets Space James, who uses his model from the original game.\n\nThis version of James reveals that the James you\u2019re playing is just a clone before an alien swoops in and zaps James with a ray gun before abducting him.\n\nIf you\u2019re a longtime fan of the franchise, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s a tradition for the Silent Hill games to feature a fever dream-like UFO ending in each one.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty funny and lighthearted moment that gives you a breathing moment in between the games\u2019 nonstop onslaught of psychological and gruesome horror.\n\nHow to Get the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake\n\nAll you need to do is stare at this shiny object in a few places around town.\n\nTo unlock the UFO Ending in Silent Hill 2 Remake, you\u2019ll need to follow a few specific steps during your New Game Plus playthrough.\n\nYou need to finish the game at least once. The UFO Ending can only be unlocked in a New Game Plus file, so make sure you\u2019ve wrapped up a full run before attempting this Easter egg.\n\nIn the New Game Plus file, you need to locate the Blue Gem item. It\u2019s the key to triggering the UFO Ending and only appears after your first playthrough, so don\u2019t bother trying to find it during your first run.\n\nOnce you\u2019re in New Game Plus, head to Neely Street in Eastern South Vale. There, you\u2019ll find the Jeweller\u2019s Store, located north of Big Jay\u2019s. Smash through the store window to grab the Blue Gem, which is sitting on top of a jewelry box.\n\nTo trigger the UFO Ending, you\u2019ll need to use the Blue Gem in four specific locations:\n\nSaul Apartments Rooftop (Eastern South Vale)\n\nRosewater Park Pier (Western South Vale)\n\nLakeview Hotel Docks\n\nRoom 312 in Lakeview Hotel\n\nOnce you\u2019ve used the Blue Gem in the first three locations, head to Room 312 in the Lakeview Hotel and inspect the gem there.\n\nTip When you inspect the Blue Gem at each location, it should glow and make alien-like noises.\n\nIf you\u2019ve done everything correctly, the game will instantly cut to the UFO Ending, skipping the final boss fight entirely.\n\nYou\u2019ll also get the \u2018Tinfoil Hat\u2019 trophy, needed as part of getting the Platinum for this game\u2014check out our trophy guide for more information.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it for this Silent Hill 2 ending.

        "article_content": "Have you ever heard of Grendizer and Spazer? Grendizer, also known as Goldorak, is a giant monster robot that connects and synchronizes with Spazer, a flying saucer that enables the robot to fly. FYI, the robot and flying saucer are characters in the 1970s Japanese manga and anime series UFO Robot Grendizer. How do I explain this to a watch audience not up to speed with Japanese animation? Think of Louis Abraham Breguet\u2019s world\u2019s first \u201csympathique clock\u201d first presented in 1798. It\u2019s a system consisting of a clock and a pocket watch. When putting the watch in the clock\u2019s cradle, it will automatically reset, adjust, and synchronize with the mother clock. Now you know how the robot and his flying saucer interact, but how did Grendizer end up on the dial of the Tissot PRX?\n\nThere are two possible answers to that question. The first is that it teamed up with Spazer, took off, and perfectly executed a precision landing on the dial of the 40mm watch. The second answer is a bit more lengthy but more realistic. To understand what Grendizer is, please check out the Wikipedia page on the anime series. That\u2019s what I did, and it made me decide not to dive too deep into the complicated world of Duke Fleed, King Vega, and the flying saucer Spazer. Instead, I will just focus on the watch, the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer ref. T137.407.11.041.02.\n\nTissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer \u2014 Who needs a 1970s glow-in-the-dark monster robot on a watch dial?\n\nI need to stop asking questions before answering them. So let me get back to the second possible answer to the previous question: Grendizer appears on the dial of a PRX because the decision-makers at Tissot think manga and anime are cool. The Swiss watch and the Japanese manga and animated TV series originated in the 1970s, creating a timeline-correct connection. The PRX is a retro-hip watch embraced by a large audience. A PRX with a manga robot on the dial appeals to anime fans. I perceive the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer as a clever brand extension constructed to win retro-futurism enthusiasts\u2019 hearts and minds. The Tissot marketing must have done extensive research on the target audience and how big it is.\n\nGrendizer comes with Spazer\n\nI am sure you don\u2019t want a summary of all the technical details of this Grendizer watch because, apart from the styling, it is a 40mm PRX Powermatic 80 model you have been reading about on Fratello for quite a while now. The manga-inspired PRX presents itself with Grendizer\u2019s Super-LumiNova-coated bust on the deep blue dial. The central seconds hand is modeled after the Harken weapon that Grendizer wields, and the robot\u2019s image is engraved on the rotor visible through the transparent case back.\n\nThe Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer landed on my desk, and that was some sort of miracle. Why? Because Grendizer did that without using Spazer. When you buy the watch, though, the box the watch comes in is shaped like Spazer. Maybe this is the coolest feature of the watch. Can the luminescent outline of Grendizer beat the hero\u2019s legendary spacecraft doubling as a box? Maybe not, but the PRX does have some very neat details.\n\nI already mentioned the central seconds hand with its weapon-like counterweight, but there\u2019s also a thematic engraving on the flange. If you angle the watch and look closely, you can read \u201cUFO\u30ed\u30dc \u30b0\u30ec\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u201d (Y\u016bf\u014d Robo Gurendaiz\u0101), the original Japanese title of the manga series.\n\nFinal thoughts on the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer\n\nThe agony of choice is a phenomenon that applies to Tissot\u2019s PRX collection. There are more than plenty of variations to choose from. The Grendizer broadens the collection while simultaneously being a niche product. What I appreciate about the manga-inspired watch is that it doesn\u2019t look too gimmicky. In the dark, the robot presents itself more prominently, but you will only discover his weapon turning around the dial once a minute after close observation. The same goes for the engraving on the flange and the rotor.\n\nThe standard steel versions of the 40mm PRX Powermatic 80 and the versions with the gradient \u201cChameleon\u201d models cost \u20ac775. The PRX UFO Robot Grendizer is a special edition, not a limited one, and costs \u20ac895. You pay extra for the additional lume on the dial and some other details, including Grendizer\u2019s Spazer doubling as a watch box. To be clear, putting the PRX in the box won\u2019t automatically reset, adjust, and synchronize with a mother clock because it\u2019s just a box. And since it is just a box, the watch will also not be able to fly like Grendizer could with Spazer. Anyway, if you, like me, are not into manga, paying \u20ac120 extra doesn\u2019t make much sense, although I do appreciate the execution of the Grendizer theme. So, Fratello-reading manga fans out there, what do you think of the Tissot PRX UFO Robot Grendizer? Let me know in the comments."

        "article_content": "Computer vision applications are getting a huge boost from advances in smartphones combined with AI that helps fill in the gaps of what everyday devices cannot see. Using these tools, a startup out of Munich called Beyond Presence believes it holds the keys to what is coming next: Hyper-realistic avatars that look and sound exactly like their human counterparts and can be used in real-time, conversational situations.\n\nThe startup today said it raised its first outside funding, a pre-seed round of $3.1 million from a number of backers. German firm HV Capital is leading the round, with 10x Founders, Alba VC, and individuals from Meta, DeepMind and Zalando also participating.\n\nBeyond Presence hasn\u2019t actually released its technology into the world just yet, but it is close, Awais Shafique, the startup\u2019s CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch.\n\nPart of the new capital will be used to continue developing the company\u2019s foundational models, he said, and some will fund the release of its public beta by the end of this month.\n\nSo far, some 300 companies are on the waitlist for the product, which will likely have early applications in areas like customer service and support, recruitment, sales, and e-learning. All of these are areas in which companies are looking to scale up interactions with users without having to hire and train more people.\n\nThe founders\u2019 backgrounds serve to explain how the startup has managed to raise a multi-million round even before it\u2019s launched a product, and come this far as a resource-intensive AI company without any outside funding.\n\nShafique previously co-founded Presize, a computer vision startup that could accurately take users\u2019 measurements by recording a clip of the users turning around once in front of their smartphone cameras. Those measurements could then be used to help buy apparel online. The Munich-based startup had an outsized profile in its home country because the founders participated in the German TV version of \u201cDragons Den\u201d/\u201cShark Tank\u201d in 2020, where they raised a record-breaking \u20ac650,000.\n\nThen in April 2022, it emerged that Meta had acquired Presize. Although the price and exact date of the transaction were never disclosed, some signals point to a big deal.\n\nSubsequent SEC filings show that Meta spent between $774 million (from January to March) and $1.15 billion (in the first six months of the year) on acquisitions. Presize was the only deal publicly disclosed at that time. Wikipedia\u2019s list of Meta acquisitions, meanwhile, has been edited with a much more modest estimate: $100 million.\n\nSources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that a deal value in the lower nine figures would be more accurate than ten figures, in this case.\n\nRegardless of where Presize fell in that range, given that the startup had only raised \u201ca couple of million,\u201d in Shafique\u2019s estimate, he and his co-founders exited very well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucrative enough that we don\u2019t have to work,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\n(They\u2019re all still working anyway. In addition to Shafique\u2019s latest startup, Presize\u2019s other co-founders, Leon Szeli and Tomislav Tomov, are still at Meta, working on its generative AI projects. They remain in contact with Shafique, though: both are investing in Beyond Presence.)\n\nAt its heart, Presize was aiming to solve a thorny computer vision problem, and that is what Beyond Presence is aiming to do as well.\n\nAdmittedly, my initial thoughts about Beyond Presence\u2019s pitch were skeptical.\n\nDigital avatars are not exactly uncharted territory. Not only have they been around for decades, but they have been getting a boost of attention more recently \u2014 and maybe some hype \u2014 with the latest innovations in AI and processing, not to mention the craze for all things chatbot.\n\nThere are also no clear ideas of what will work in the realm of avatars as a long-term business. Some, like Hyper and Ready Player Me (backed respectively by Amazon and A16Z), are drawing from gaming culture and the theory that avatars should not be realistic versions of the people using them. Those who want to hide their identities to preserve their privacy might opt for these approaches over those that replicate their exact likeness.\n\nOthers, like Synthesia, can create likenesses of people. But they require studio visits, and are not the basis of the main product, which uses modest devices like phone cameras to capture your expressions to power avatars that do not look like you.\n\nAnd some others are trying to build tools that you can interact with using everyday devices \u2014 these include Veed and Deepbrain.\n\nBeyond Presence is aiming for not only an avatar that can be created on-the-fly using your phone, but one that looks like you and can be used in real-time, unscripted conversational situations. Something like a video version of the text-based chatbots offered by OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta and many others.\n\nThe startup is not the only one in this space, of course. Zoom appears to be working on hyper-realistic custom avatars, and CommonGround is also developing something along similar lines.\n\nFor now, Beyond Presence is focusing on building something unique in the video component of its product.\n\nEleven Labs is powering the voice part of the experience, and OpenAI\u2019s GPT is the generative AI model powering the content. Business customers can flexibly change which model they use.\n\n\u201cYou can also leave everything up to us, [or use] any LLM that you would like, or any voice agent that you would like. And then we do the face on top of it,\u201d he said. This feature addresses the fact that enterprise customers might already be working with particular LLM providers, for example, or do not want to share any proprietary data externally, he noted.\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting detail about Beyond Presence\u2019s early decisions around funding: It turns out that the company was accepted to participate in Y Combinator earlier this year, but opted out of the prestigious incubator.\n\nAlthough YC definitely gives access to great networks, Shafique and his co-founder Felix Altenberger (CTO; and a former deep learning specialist at Presize) chose not to give up equity and autonomy to access that.\n\nWhile YC partners might have had their own input on how to grow the company with sales, Shafique said he and Altenberger had a \u201chorizontal\u201d approach they wanted to pursue.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to move more on the core technology and foundation model layer,\u201d he said."

The recent release of Apple Intelligence on the iPhone 16 series stands to further threaten Google\u2019s ambitions of leading the AI space. The search giant still has a numbers advantage, though, with the entire Android ecosystem at its disposal. So unsurprisingly, we\u2019re now starting to see Google\u2019s Gemini Nano AI model on more and more devices, including Samsung and Xiaomi phones.\n\nSo what does Gemini Nano achieve on Android and should your next smartphone support it? Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nWhat is Gemini Nano and why does it matter? Gemini Nano is Google\u2019s smallest AI model designed specifically to run directly on smartphones like the Pixel 9 series. Specifically, it\u2019s a large language model that excels at text-based tasks \u2014 it can suggest replies for chat conversations, draft messages, and more. Recent Gemini Nano releases are also multimodal, meaning it can understand images and audio. However, it\u2019s not as capable as a full language model either \u2014 you can\u2019t directly talk to Gemini Nano like you would with ChatGPT or the standalone Gemini app. The latter is Google\u2019s AI chatbot that\u2019s accessible on any device.\n\nThe advantage of Gemini Nano is that it runs on-device, which means it does not send any data to Google\u2019s servers for processing. In fact, Gemini Nano will work offline even if you don\u2019t have an active internet connection. This translates to faster response times and better privacy, since most online AI platforms use your data to train future models.\n\nGemini Nano runs in the background, allowing your phone to process AI tasks without a connection.\n\nGemini Nano is specifically optimized for mobile hardware, but it still takes up some memory as it has to run in the background. This is why the Pixel 9 series ships with 16GB of RAM \u2014 a sizable chunk is reserved for AI models like Gemini Nano. Modern chipsets like the Tensor G4 and Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 also have neural processing units (NPUs) to efficiently run such AI models.\n\nWith Gemini Nano support now extending beyond the Pixel lineup, Google\u2019s goal is to make AI capabilities a core part of the Android experience. However, we may only see the model supported on premium phones given the relatively higher processing requirements. You can find a full list of devices with Gemini Nano support below.\n\nGemini Nano features: What do you get? The list of Gemini Nano features will differ depending on your device, but here\u2019s a quick rundown of what the model is capable of. We\u2019re starting to see more and more features trickle down to other devices, but chances are that you\u2019ll need a modern phone with powerful enough hardware to ever see Gemini Nano support.\n\n1. Gboard Smart Reply\n\nGoogle\n\nWhile smartphone keyboards have offered next-word suggestions for over a decade, Google added experimental Gemini Nano support to Gboard for \u201csmart replies\u201d with \u201cconversational awareness\u201d. In simpler terms, the keyboard now uses AI to suggest replies based on the text of your chats. The feature works within WhatsApp, Line, and KakaoTalk, but is limited to US English for now.\n\n2. Summarize in Recorder\n\nGoogle\n\nThe Pixel Recorder app relies on Gemini Nano to offer AI-generated summaries of audio recordings. On the Pixel 8 series, the model could only summarize around fifteen minutes of audio. However, Google\u2019s latest Pixel 9 series includes a newer version of the model that allows for summaries of recordings over half an hour long.\n\nThe Galaxy AI suite also includes a similar AI summarization feature in Samsung\u2019s Voice Recorder app. However, it relies on Google\u2019s larger Gemini Pro model that can only run in the cloud. The upside is that Samsung\u2019s competing feature can handle hours-long recordings at the expense of privacy and speed.\n\n3. Magic Compose\n\nMagic Compose in Google Messages\n\nMagic Compose is a feature within the Google Messages app that uses Gemini Nano to generate suggested replies based on the last 20 messages in a conversation. It offers various writing styles like Formal, Excited, Chill, and even Shakespearean, allowing you to adjust the tone of the AI-generated responses.\n\n4. Pixel Screenshots\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nIntroduced with the Pixel 9 series, the Pixel Screenshots app uses Gemini Nano to extract and identify important information from past screenshots. The app offers a search bar so you can ask for specific details like a recipe you saved or an address from a friend\u2019s chat in plain English instead of scrolling through a list of unorganized screenshots.\n\nSince all of the AI processing takes place offline, you get near-immediate results even with thousands of screenshots in your gallery.\n\n5. TalkBack TalkBack, Android\u2019s accessibility feature, is getting a boost thanks to Gemini Nano\u2019s multimodal abilities. It provides rich and detailed descriptions of images, allowing users with blindness or low vision to understand what\u2019s on their screen.\n\nUnlike TalkBack\u2019s older model, which only offered simple descriptions, Gemini Nano can identify specific landmarks or details. You can think of it as a reverse AI image generator, meaning it can offer useful results like \u201cA panoramic view of Sydney Opera House at night.\u201d\n\n6. Pixel Weather AI reports\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nAs you may have guessed from the name, this is an AI integration within Google\u2019s dedicated Weather app. Prior to the Pixel 9\u2019s release, tapping on the weather forecast would take you to the Google app. However, the Pixel Weather app offers more data, better widgets, a smoother UI, and support for Gemini Nano.\n\nWhy would you need an on-device AI to know the weather? The idea is that Gemini Nano generates a short summary of the upcoming weather at the top of the app, saving you the trouble of reading through the expected precipitation, temperature, and other forecast numbers. It can also take additional factors such as UV index and air quality index into account, giving you well-rounded information at a glance.\n\n7. Call Notes\n\nGoogle\n\nCall Notes is another Pixel-exclusive feature that debuted alongside the Pixel 9 series. The feature records your phone calls and then employs Gemini Nano to generate a summary of the conversation. However, you\u2019ll need to manually activate the feature for each phone call that you\u2019d like to record and summarize. The other party will hear an audible message that says \u201cGoogle Call Notes is on. The call is recorded.\u201d Galaxy AI offers a similar feature, which also processes recordings offline.\n\nWhich phones support Gemini Nano?\n\nRyan Haines / Android Authority\n\nGemini Nano made its debut exclusively on the Pixel 8 Pro, but it has slowly made its way to more devices, including several non-Google ones. Here\u2019s a list of devices that support Gemini Nano:\n\nGoogle Pixel 9 series, including the Pixel 9 Pro Fold\n\nGoogle Pixel 8a\n\nGoogle Pixel 8 series\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 series\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 FE\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 Xiaomi 14T series (support announced)\n\nXiaomi MIX Flip (support announced)\n\nMotorola Edge 50 Ultra\n\nMotorola Razr 50 Ultra\n\nWe expect future premium smartphones to include Gemini Nano support especially since regular apps on your phone will soon be able to take advantage of the AI model. Google has streamlined the process of downloading and updating the Gemini Nano model via AICore, which also provides an interface to third-party developers. In early 2024, Google said that it provided an early access preview to companies like Adobe and Grammarly to incoporate the on-device model within their apps. This could allow a PDF reader like Adobe Acrobat to generate AI summaries without an internet connection.\n\nYou might like\n\nComments"

        "article_content": "Big Read\n\nHave you ever had an experience that was a little bit\u2026 well\u2026 spooky? Some people believe they have had encounters with ghosts, had premonitions that came true, or even met an uncannily accurate psychic.\n\nOpinions can be divided about whether such experiences are real, though, with some insisting that everything must have a rational explanation.\n\nFor sceptics, supernatural beliefs may be hard to fathom, but there are at least six mental traits that push people into believing in the paranormal, Professor Chris French, a psychologist at Goldsmiths, University of London, said on Saturday at the London science festival, New Scientist Live.\n\nExpectation effect\n\nYou might think that we sense the world around us simply by our senses. In fact, the brain\u2019s complex circuitry means much of our conscious experiences are a mix of what the brain \u201cexpects\u201d to perceive, based on past events \u2013 a system sometimes called \u201ctop-down processing\u201d.\n\nBut sometimes the brain\u2019s predictions are wrong. Top-down processing is behind most optical illusions \u2013 and can explain why someone might report seeing or hearing something that didn\u2019t really happen.\n\nThe predictions are easily influenced by external suggestions, which can explain why people often claim to have had creepy encounters when they have been primed to expect them \u2013 like at a s\u00e9ance or a supposedly haunted location, as Prof French explains in his recent book, The Science of Weird Shit: Why our minds conjure the paranormal.\n\nIn an experiment, Professor Richard Wiseman at the University of Hertfordshire held a s\u00e9ance with a fake medium to see how easy it would be to convince members of the public that spirits were present. While some of the special effects were achieved with trickery, the medium\u2019s misleading statements also influenced what people experienced.\n\nFor instance, the medium sometimes said, incorrectly, that the table was moving. Afterwards, a third of the participants said that the table had moved.\n\nSome people reported extra effects they had imagined, like a strange sweet and acrid smell \u2013 presumably influenced by the spooky atmosphere.\n\nIn another study, a conjuror tried to convince people that he could use psychic powers to bend a metal key, by secretly switching the original key for a crooked one. After revealing the bent key, he put it down on a table and said: \u201cIt\u2019s still bending.\u201d About four in 10 thought it had warped in front of their eyes.\n\nPattern spotting\n\nThe human brain is designed by evolution to understand our surroundings by spotting patterns and connections.\n\nFor instance, when our ancestors were vulnerable to predators, they could have been more likely to survive if any suspicious rustles were taken as a threat until proven otherwise, said Prof French. \u201cOne Stone Age man assumes it\u2019s a tiger and gets the hell out of there. If his neighbour stands there until he\u2019s certain, that could be a more costly error.\u201d\n\nPeople vary in how prone they are to drawing conclusions during uncertainty \u2013 something that can be tested in the lab. This could help explain why some people believe they have had ghostly encounters, when others who were also present disagree, said Prof French.\n\nFacial recognition\n\nOne clear case of incorrect pattern recognition is our tendency to \u201csee\u201d faces when they are not there. \u201cYou can see how this tendency might lead us to think we\u2019ve seen a face in the shadows,\u201d said Prof French.\n\nSpotting faces is such an important part of human social lives, there is a part of the brain that has facial recognition as its main job. Babies just a few days old are especially interested in faces and spend more time looking at even quite simple drawings of faces than other drawings.\n\nThe brain\u2019s interest in faces is probably also why images of Jesus and the Virgin Mary have been reported in chapatis, windows and plastered walls, said Prof French. In one study that tested people\u2019s ability to spot faces in confusing visual images, paranormal believers were better at seeing face-like features that had been deliberately added \u2013 but also more prone to wrongly seeing faces that weren\u2019t really there.\n\nUnconscious powers\n\nSome strange experiences can unknowingly be generated by our own bodies, for instance, when people use Ouija boards, where a glass or pointer seems to move around an inscribed alphabet, to spell out messages from spirits. Crucially, though, several people are usually resting their hand on the pointer for this to happen.\n\nAs long as no one is deliberately cheating, the messages are usually down to the \u201cideomotor effect\u201d, when people make tiny muscle movements without realising it. With Ouija boards, if all those sat around the board are blindfolded, no meaningful messages can be produced, said Prof French.\n\nThe ideomotor effect can also explain dowsing, when some believe they can find underground water by the movements of hand-held sticks or a pendulum. Many people are convinced they can personally dowse, although whenever Prof French has tested dowsers by using bottles of water hidden in boxes, they have always failed.\n\nFalse memories\n\nMemory doesn\u2019t work like a video camera that gives perfect replay. Whenever we recall a memory, the brain circuits that encode it become temporarily more malleable, with the result that the same memory is effectively re-recorded again and again.\n\nIf someone hears incorrect information about the event in question while recalling it, that can lead to the wrong facts becoming mixed in with the right ones. That\u2019s partly why eyewitness reports of crimes are so often wrong.\n\nFor obvious reasons, the fallibility of our memory could contribute to people saying they have experienced paranormal events that didn\u2019t really happen at all.\n\nIn another version of the \u201ckey-bending\u201d demonstration, Prof Wiseman got the volunteers to watch the trick alongside another person who was a secret helper. When the helper insisted they had seen the key bend, the volunteer was more likely to report later that they had also seen this happen. \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple manipulation with a big effect,\u201d said Prof French.\n\nPre-determined conclusions\n\nIf a situation is uncertain, people tend to be more impressed by evidence that supports what they already believe to be true. \u201cWe tend to notice more of such evidence compared to evidence that contradicts our belief,\u201d said Prof French. \u201cWe find it more compelling.\u201d\n\nThis tendency, sometimes called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d helps to explain why some mediums and psychics can be very convincing.\n\nThey typically bombard their clients with multiple statements. Usually only a few will be correct, perhaps by chance \u2013 but these are more likely to be remembered. Prof French estimates he has tested about a dozen psychics in his career, and so far none has demonstrated any genuine abilities against his rigorous testing methods.\n\nIt isn\u2019t only believers in the paranormal who may be guilty of this bias, though, Professor Neil Dagnall, a psychologist at Manchester Metropolitan University told i . Non-believers might also pay more attention to evidence that supports their sceptical stance, he said.\n\nBut belief in the supernatural is very widespread \u2013 shared by nearly half the UK population according to some surveys, with higher figures obtained if belief in superstitions are included. \u201cA lot of people will claim to have had paranormal experiences themselves,\u201d said Prof Dagnall.\n\n\u201cAnd even if people deny paranormal beliefs, they will say things like \u2018touch wood\u2019,\u201d he said. Superstitions would also be classed as paranormal beliefs, as phenomena unexplainable by science, said Prof Dagnall."

Half were rested in the infamous Pennhurst Asylum in Spring City, Pennsylvania, which closed in 1987 amid decades of controversy. The other half spent time in the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, West Virginia, which opened in 1864, closed in 1994, and is a favorite site among ghost hunters and paranormal TV shows for its reported hauntings and unexplained activity.\n\nharridan vodka\n\nWhat does hanging out in such places do to the spirits? There's only one way to find out.\n\nEach bottle is hand-numbered and comes packaged in a locally carved wood box, with a prescription pad, an authenticity card and gloves for safe handling. That last bit could be overkill, or it could be necessary. Hard to say, but as every horror movie has taught us, this is no time to be cavalier.\n\n\n\nThe Asylum Edition follows the brand's release last year, in which the vodka spent time in two of the country's most haunted hotels. Before that, Harridan released 666 bottles that were rested for 30 days at the Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut, which houses the infamous Annabelle doll. Clearly they've got a theme here.\n\nAnd now seems like a great time for a drink."

        "article_content": "Since the Nobel Prizes were created in 1901, just 24 women have received awards in the sciences. This year, that number stayed the same: All seven laureates in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine were men.\n\nSome scientists have expressed frustration about the lack of women among this year\u2019s awardees, particularly the omission of two women who contributed to the work honored for the prize in physiology or medicine. Experts who study gender bias in the sciences say the Nobel\u2019s gender gap reflects the larger barriers to success faced by women in science \u2014 and that science is poorer for it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe men who received this year\u2019s prizes are \u201csuperstars,\u201d said Liselotte Jauffred, a physicist at the Niels Bohr Institute who has studied gender bias in the Nobels. But \u201cwhat are the mechanisms that make it easier for men to enter that pool of superstar scientists that could even be nominated for a Nobel Prize?\u201d\n\nCertain fields, like biology, chemistry and social sciences are reaching gender parity in undergraduate and graduate degrees. But representation falls further up the academic ladder \u2014 a problem known as the leaky pipeline. Some women are pushed out of science altogether because of experiences of sexism. Those who persist are less often promoted to senior professorships, and even fewer become chief physicians, department heads, or journal editors.\n\nEven once in academia, women are not given tenure as often as men. They are not listed as the key author on as many papers, are cited less often than male colleagues, and receive fewer prestigious awards overall.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFiguring out whether the Nobels reflect even more bias than academia as a whole was \u201cnot easy\u201d Jauffred said. Researchers had to account for the lag between when a discovery is made and when it is recognized, and for the lower representation of women in science over the years. But even when accounting for those factors, she and her colleagues found in a 2019 study that the likelihood that bias against women played a role in the decision of who gets awards was around 96%.\n\nThis year\u2019s Nobel for physiology or medicine, which was awarded to Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros for the discovery of microRNA, has attracted particular scrutiny with regard to gender bias. Many outside observers commented on the fact that Rosalind Lee, Ambros\u2019 wife and long-time collaborator, was not recognized for the discovery despite being a first author on one of the studies cited by the committee. To some, the story seemed to write itself \u2014 another Rosalind overlooked by the committee, much like Rosalind Franklin, whose contributions to the discovery of DNA\u2019s double helix were not initially recognized.\n\nThere are, however, reasons beyond sexism that can lead collaborators like Lee to get overlooked. The Nobel committee limits awards to three people, which some scientists have pointed out is an antiquated way to reward discoveries that are increasingly part of large collaborations.\n\n\u201cAny project of any complexity rolls out over years with many contributors,\u201d said Bruce Wightman, a biologist at Muhlenberg College who was in Ruvkun\u2019s lab and worked on an aspect of the discovery of microRNA. \u201cScience takes a village.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for UMass Chan Medical School said Lee and Ambros are \u201ccelebrating the Nobel Prize and view it as a recognition of the team\u2019s collaborative work.\u201d\n\nThe push to reduce gender bias in Nobel Prizes\n\nThat said, how credit is distributed to scientists that are part of a large collaboration may also be the product of bias. One study found that women who co-authored papers were less likely to receive tenure compared to those who published papers alone. This kind of collaboration didn\u2019t have any effect on men\u2019s ability to get tenure. Another found that women tended to receive authorship on papers or patents to which they had contributed less often than male colleagues.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Nobels tend to \u201crecognize people who were in a position of power and authority, instead of the people who actually made a discovery or had an idea or proved it experimentally,\u201d said Pnina Abir-Am, a historian of science at Brandeis University, who has studied collaborative couples in science as well as documented the women who were not recognized for the Nobel prize for RNA splicing.\n\nNewsletter Weekdays Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address.

You may opt out of receiving STAT communications at any time.\n\nThe Nobel committee is often \u201cnarrow-minded\u201d in who it gives awards to, Abir-Am said, favoring those who are heads of the lab where the research was conducted as well as those who have trained with other Nobel laureates. That means lower chances of receiving the prize for women, racial minorities, and more junior scientists who have made breakthrough discoveries but are less likely to be in positions of power.\n\nNobel winners also tend to come from socioeconomically privileged backgrounds, according to Paul Novosad, an economist at Dartmouth College who studies access to opportunity and upward mobility. Novosad and his colleagues published a white paper this week finding that on average, laureates came from households with fathers in the 87th percentile of income in their country. Around half were in the top 5% by income.\n\nFemale laureates tended to be from even more elite families, which the authors write may be because the higher socioeconomic status helps them overcome some of the gendered obstacles in academia. But \u201cit means that elite women in the sciences are drawn from an even smaller socioeconomic pool than men, implying substantial misallocation,\u201d they write in the paper.\n\n\u201cIf children who are brilliant but poor fail to make it into the sciences, then all of humanity loses out on their potential discoveries,\u201d said Novosad.\n\nThings may be changing. The analysis found that the average socioeconomic status of laureates is creeping downward, which could signal a slow democratization of the sciences. \u201cThis kind of research is really important for the same reasons that we would like to see less elite demographics represented in various top positions,\u201d said Novosad. \u201cUnfortunately there is still a surprising amount of work to do just to convince men in senior scientific positions that these barriers exist at all.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne change that may make recognition more fair going forward is the growing practice of papers delineating what each author has contributed to a paper. \u201cJournals require scientists to say who contributed to conception and who contributed to experiments,\u201d Abir-Am said. This creates less ambiguity around who directly contributed to discoveries that are being honored by awards \u2014 as opposed to assuming lab heads or senior authors did the lion\u2019s share of the work. \u201cI don\u2019t care who is a director and who is a junior [researcher], I want to know who did what.\u201d\n\nThe organizations that select Nobel laureates have taken steps to address the laureates\u2019 lack of diversity in recent years. In 2019, Nobel committees began asking nominators to consider gender and ethnicity to encourage a wider range of diversity in nominees. And since scientists have to be invited to contribute nominations, \u201c[w]e are extending invitations to an increasing number of individuals from regions beyond traditional academic research hubs in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan,\u201d Thomas Perlmann, the secretary for the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, told Nature this week. \u201cMoreover, we\u2019re actively identifying more women and younger scientists as nominators.\u201d\n\nJauffred has also seen improvement. She was motivated to write her paper on gender bias in the Nobels after Donna Strickland in 2018 became the first woman to win the Nobel in physics in 55 years. Since 2018, two more women have also won the Nobel in physics. Still, progress is slow.\n\n\u201cThe demography of fields has been changing for a long time, but it\u2019s not yet reflected in Nobel Prizes,\u201d Jauffred said. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t see that diversity represented in the Nobel Prizes, of course we ask ourselves questions. Why does it have to be like that?\u201d\n\nMegan Molteni contributed reporting."
