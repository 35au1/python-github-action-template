The more and more people that come out, the less likely it is that it isn\u2019t true.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the largest public disinformation campaign in government history if it\u2019s true.\u2019\n\n\u2018We gotta see the evidence. Time for stories is over,\u2019 added Chad Remsen.\n\nPopular UFO account Joe Murgia shared the trailer but cautioned: \u2018This is the game changer you\u2019ve been hearing about for a while now. We\u2019ll see.\u2019\n\nThe Age of Disclosure will premiere at the SXSW Film Festival.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page \u2013 we\u2019d love to hear from you.\n\nArrow MORE: Katie Price\u2019s need for baby number six suddenly makes sense\n\nArrow MORE: Jack the Ripper is \u2018ground zero\u2019 for our true crime obsession"

I never went looking for the paranormal, it found me,\u201d he said.\n\nJust as his fascination with the Buoys and Timothy \u2014 he was the founder and publisher on the rock magazine Timothy which later became Pennsylvania Musician \u2014 led to the paranormal aspects of the Sheppton book \u201cCoal Region Hoodoo\u201d which led him to Bigfoot. The Bigfoot book evolved from two chapters in his \u201cCoal Region Hoodoo\u201d book.\n\nFurek, who splits his time between his hometown Mocanaqua and Hernando, Florida, said his Bigfoot research has struck a nerve within the believers\u2019 community.\n\nChapters in Coal Region Hoodoo \u2014\u201dThe Bigfoot Enigma\u201d and \u201cThe Bigfoot Hypothesis\u201d \u2014opened a few doors for him.\n\nHe was interviewed on Art Bell\u2019s \u201cMidnight in the Desert\u201d radio show and by George Noory on the \u201cCoast to Coast\u201d radio show which airs on over 600 affiliates and is considered the top paranormal show in the country by many in the paranormal community. York County\u2019s Fox TV 43 chose Coal Region Hoodoo as the Book of the Month in October 2023.\n\nThis year, interest in his paranormal research isn\u2019t slowing down. He\u2019s been invited for the second time to the the Central Pennsylvania Bigfoot and Cryptid Festival and conferences in Baltimore and Virginia. \u201cIt\u2019s like an extended family. Everybody knows everybody else,\u201d he said of the paranormal community.\n\nIn 23 chapters over 197 pages, \u201cThe Lost Tribes of Bigfoot\u201d explores all the well-known Bigfoot sightings from the origin story to Chestnut Ridge, an area in the Laurel Highlands in Western Pennsylvania known as a hotbed for sightings. He also writes about hoaxes including The Piltdown Man and The Minnesota Iceman. He devotes a couple chapters to the hoaxers, a pet peeve.\n\nAsked why it was important for him to call out the hoaxers, he said, \u201cThey damage the reputation of legitimate paranormal research and need to be called out.\u201d\n\nAsked about interviewing Bigfoot witnesses, he said, \u201cOne guy from western Pennsylvania claimed that he has PTSD from seeing a Bigfoot at 15 feet. A neighbor of mine saw two Bigfoot creatures outside of Mocanaqua. I questioned him about it several times and all his responses seemed credible. An elderly guy from Catawissa told a police officer that he wasn\u2019t scared when he saw a Bigfoot because the creature had \u2018kind eyes.\u2019 The stories have a commonality, but they are all unique. Remember, too, that about three percent of anomalous sightings remain unexplained. People are seeing things.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s his own take on Bigfoot\u2019s existence? \u201cI\u2019m not a true believer or zealot. I\u2019m just fascinated with paranormal themes and looking for answers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only theory that makes sense is that an interdimensional pathway may link our reality to somewhere else. It\u2019s a theory explored by Einstein, Tesla, and others and may provide the key to understanding the universe\u2019s secrets.\u201d\n\nThe book is available in paperback and digital versions at amazon.com., hanger1publishing.com, and maximfurek.com."

For centuries, people have admired tides for their predictability, beauty, but there is something that lies beneath the surface of these waters and is quietly shaping our world. This groundbreaking discovery promises to open new doors in geophysics, revealing the most intricate details about Earth's magnetic field , never seen before. How were these signals discovered, and what secrets might they hold? As researchers dig deeper, the implications could range from improving global navigation systems to unlocking clues about our planet's evolution. The tides, it seems, have much more to tell.Scientists have detected the weakest magnetic signals produced by Earth's ocean tides, opening up new windows into the inner workings of the planet. These faint signals, recorded by satellites in very low orbits, are produced as seawater flows through Earth's magnetic field, creating weak electric currents. Researchers analyzed data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Swarm mission to successfully interpret these elusive signals.Published 2 December 2024, scientists have made this new discovery after the ocean tide can tell what's beneath them in terms of magma. Here is the part where the findings of Alexander Grayver, from the University of Cologne, an author and leader of scientific research, mention that it will be the lowest signals that these swarms ever sense.The European Space Agency consists of three satellites launched in 2013. Its mission was to complete the study about Earth's magnetic field in the year 2017, but it was further extended due to its huge contribution to science, and it did so gradually at the expense of atmospheric drag causing the orbit lowering of the spacecraft.The recent study also had the advantage of a solar minimum, a period during which there is a decrease in solar activity approximately every 11 years. This means that interference from the Sun's electromagnetic radiation and charged particles decreases, so a satellite might sense the minute signatures of magnetic waves that exist on Earth.Swarm is anticipated to be operational up to 2030 which will coincide with the next solar minimum, potentially providing yet another unique opportunity to look for hidden oceanic signals. \"This extended mission has allowed scientists to answer new and unexpected research questions\", says mission manager Anja Str\u00f8mme."

            "article_content": "A breakthrough discovery, the coins are worth around \u00a3258,000.\n\nThe discovery, made near the village of Holzthum in northern Luxembourg, includes 141 gold solidi, coins minted under the rule of nine Roman emperors between 364 and 408 AD. Found near the base of a burgus\u2014a fortified Roman watchtower used for military observation\u2014the coins are believed to have belonged to high-ranking military officers. \u201cThis is a major archaeological discovery, as it is extremely rare to study an intact ancient monetary deposit within its original archaeological context,\u201d announced Luxembourg's National Institute for Archaeological Research (INRA). The hoard\u2019s sheer size and exceptional condition have stunned researchers. Each solidus weighs around 4.5 grams of nearly pure gold, amounting to over 6 kilograms. Rebecca Usherwood, an Assistant Professor in Late Antique and Early Byzantine Studies at Trinity College Dublin, described the discovery as extraordinary.\n\nA Gallo-Roman site located in Echternach, Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cThis represents a huge amount of personal wealth for the individual or group who collected these coins,\u201d said Prof Usherwood. \u201cMost people in the Roman Empire would rarely, if ever, have seen a single gold coin. To find this many indicates the owner was of considerable social standing, likely a military officer rather than a common soldier.\u201d The coins, which were typically used for imperial gifts or military payments, are thought to reflect the site's strategic importance. The area where the hoard was found marked the edge of the Roman Empire, an area heavily fortified against external threats. Among the most notable coins are three bearing the image of Emperor Eugenius, who ruled for just two tumultuous years (392\u2013394 AD). Eugenius, supported by the Western Roman general Arbogast, attempted to revive pagan traditions but was defeated by the Christian Eastern Emperor Theodosius I at the Battle of Frigidus in 394 AD. Coins from Eugenius\u2019 brief reign are particularly rare, adding to the significance of the find. The solidi were uncovered during a series of excavations conducted between 2020 and 2024. Luxembourg\u2019s Army Mine Action Service was involved due to nearby unexploded ordnance from World War II. The discovery was kept secret for nearly four years to protect the site and its findings. Luxembourg law stipulates that the treasure\u2019s estimated value of $322,000 (\u00a3257,919) belongs to those with legal claims to the land.\n\nJust two of the hoard of Roman coins discovered.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nHow intelligent is a model that memorizes the answers before an exam? That\u2019s the question facing OpenAI after it unveiled o3 in December, and touted its model's impressive benchmarks. At the time, some pundits hailed it as being almost as powerful as AGI, the level at which artificial intelligence is capable of achieving the same performance as a human on any task required by the user.\n\nBut money changes everything\u2014even math tests, apparently.\n\nOpenAI's victory lap over its o3 model's stunning 25.2% score on FrontierMath, a challenging mathematical benchmark developed by Epoch AI, hit a snag when it turned out the company wasn't just acing the test\u2014OpenAI helped write it, too.\n\n\u201cWe gratefully acknowledge OpenAI for their support in creating the benchmark,\u201d Epoch AI wrote in an updated footnote on the FrontierMath whitepaper\u2014and this was enough to raise some red flags among enthusiasts.\n\nImage: Epoch AI via ArXiv\n\nWorse, OpenAI had not only funded FrontierMath's development but also had access to its problems and solutions to use as it saw fit. Epoch AI later revealed that OpenAI hired the company to provide 300 math problems, as well as their solutions.\n\n\u201cAs is typical of commissioned work, OpenAI retains ownership of these questions and has access to the problems and solutions,\u201d Epoch said Thursday.\n\nNeither OpenAI nor Epoch replied to a request for comment from Decrypt. Epoch has however said that OpenAI signed a contract in advance indicating it would not use the questions and answers in its database to train its o3 model.\n\nThe Information first broke the story.\n\nWhile an OpenAI spokesperson maintains OpenAI didn't directly train o3 on the benchmark, and the problems were \u201cstrongly held out\u201d (meaning OpenAI didn\u2019t have access to some of the problems), experts note that access to the test materials could still allow performance optimization through iterative adjustments.\n\nTamay Besiroglu, associate director at Epoch AI, said that OpenAI had initially demanded that its financial relationship with Epoch not be revealed.\n\n\"We were restricted from disclosing the partnership until around the time o3 launched, and in hindsight we should have negotiated harder for the ability to be transparent to the benchmark contributors as soon as possible,\u201d he wrote in a post. \u201cOur contract specifically prevented us from disclosing information about the funding source and the fact that OpenAI has data access to much, but not all of the dataset.\u201d\n\nTamay said that OpenAI said it wouldn\u2019t use Epoch AI\u2019s problems and solutions\u2014but didn\u2019t sign any legal contract to make sure that would be enforced. \u201cWe acknowledge that OpenAI does have access to a large fraction of FrontierMath problems and solutions,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, we have a verbal agreement that these materials will not be used in model training.\u201d\n\nFishy as it sounds, Elliot Glazer, Epoch AI\u2019s lead mathematician, said he believes OpenAI was true to its word: \u201cMy personal opinion is that OAI's score is legit (i.e., they didn't train on the dataset), and that they have no incentive to lie about internal benchmarking performances,\u201d he posted on Reddit.\n\nThe researcher also took to Twitter to address the situation, sharing a link to an online debate about the issue in the online forum Less Wrong.\n\nAs for where the o3 score on FM stands: yes I believe OAI has been accurate with their reporting on it, but Epoch can't vouch for it until we independently evaluate the model using the holdout set we are developing. \u2014 Elliot Glazer (@ElliotGlazer) January 19, 2025\n\nNot the first, not the last\n\nThe controversy extends beyond OpenAI, pointing to systemic issues in how the AI industry validates progress. A recent investigation by AI researcher Louis Hunt revealed that other top performing models including Mistral 7b, Google\u2019s Gemma, Microsoft\u2019s Phi-3, Meta\u2019s Llama-3 and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen 2.5 were able to reproduce verbatim 6,882 pages of the MMLU and GSM8K benchmarks.\n\nMMLU is a synthetic benchmark, just like FrontierMath, that was created to measure how good models are at multitasking. GSM8K is a set of math problems used to benchmark how proficient LLMs are at math.\n\nImage: Louis Hunt\n\nThat makes it impossible to properly assess how powerful or accurate their models truly are. It\u2019s like giving a student with a photographic memory a list of the problems and solutions that will be on their next exam; did they reason their way to a solution, or simply spit back the memorized answer? Since these tests are intended to demonstrate that AI models are capable of reasoning, you can see what the fuss is about.\n\n\"It's actually A VERY BIG ISSUE,\" RemBrain founder Vasily Morzhakov warned. \"The models are tested in their instruction versions on MMLU and GSM8K tests. But the fact that base models can regenerate tests\u2014it means those tests are already in pre-training.\"\n\nGoing forward, Epoch said it plans to implement a \"hold out set\" of 50 randomly selected problems that will be withheld from OpenAI to ensure genuine testing capabilities.\n\nBut the challenge of creating truly independent evaluations remains significant. Computer scientist Dirk Roeckmann argued that ideal testing would require \"a neutral sandbox which is not easy to realize,\" adding that even then, there's a risk of \"leaking of test data by adversarial humans.\"\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

New Crime Scene Photos Cast Doubts On OpenAI Whistleblower's Death\n\nCurated By :\n\nNews18.com\n\nLast Updated: January 26, 2025, 13:31 IST\n\nOpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji was found dead at his one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco. While police declared it a suicide, his parents insist their son was murdered.\n\nSuchir Balaji's death has been under scrutiny as his parents and private investigators have criticised the investigation. (X/Reuters)\n\nThe mystery over ChatGPT whistleblower Suchir Balaji continues to deepen with the release of new photos from the crime scene. While authorities have declared it a suicide, Balaji\u2019s parents have blamed OpenAI and claim their son was murdered.\n\nSuchir Balaji died in November after he had publicly raised ethical concerns about OpenAI\u2019s practices. The police deemed his death as an act of suicide but his family has called for an FBI investigation as they said that there were several lapses in the police probe.\n\nrelated stories\n\nHowever, his parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy have raised around $85,000 to pay lawyers, investigators and forensic experts to prove their son was murdered. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also weighed in on the case, saying the allegations were \u201cextremely concerning\".\n\nPhotos obtained by the UK-based Daily Mail showed blood pooled next to the bathroom where Suchir Balaji\u2019s head lay, but also splattered around the bathroom far from the body, casting doubts on the suicide theory.\n\nALSO READ: Suchir Balaji\u2019s Mother Claims Her Son Had \u2018Documents Against OpenAI\u2019, Elon Musk Backs Her\n\n\u2018Blood Everywhere, Home Ransacked\u2019\n\nThe crime scene photos showed one of Balaji\u2019s wireless earbuds and two mysterious tufts of what appeared to be synthetic hair on the bloodstains at his high-end residence in San Francisco\u2019s Buchanan Street. His home also appeared to be ransacked, \u201cLike someone was searching for something\".\n\n\u201cAfter seeing there is so much blood everywhere, I don\u2019t know how they think it\u2019s a suicide, it doesn\u2019t look close,\" Balaji\u2019s father told the Daily Mail. Since his death in November, the former OpenAI employee\u2019s apartment has hardly been touched and never been cleaned.\n\nUCLA pathology professor Dinesh Rao, who was hired by Balaji\u2019s parents, wrote a preliminary report containing dozens of photos showing the condition of his one-bedroom apartment. These images show his last meal, a half-eaten ready meal with brown rice, still in the plastic tray on his cluttered desk.\n\nNEW: Photos released of the scene where Open AI whistleblower Suchir Balaji was found deceased, family doesn\u2019t believe he took his own life.Balaji\u2019s parents say they believe their son was m*rdered. Their son had worked for OpenAI and had blown the whistle on the company\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Gqond5ASR8 \u2014 Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) January 25, 2025\n\nHis kitchen table was also cluttered, some of which spilled onto the floor along with pieces of chocolate. Rao said these surroundings indicated the possibility of a fight or resistance, and urged this to be corroborated with other evidence collected from the scene.\n\nOne of Balaji\u2019s earbuds was found on the floor near his bedroom entrance which had blood stains and hair strands on it. A large pool of dried blood was located just outside the bathroom door, along with the other earbud and a red shopping bag.\n\nRao slammed the police investigation as \u201cincomplete and inadequate\" that missed vital clues like the fake hair and earbuds, which he called \u201ca very serious error\". He said the disturbing scenes from the crime site were \u201cmore likely seen in homicidal death scenes and rarely observed in alleged suicidal cases\".\n\nPrivate Autopsy Showed Balaji Was Shot\n\nRao further said splattered blood was seen dripping down to the floor from the door and the doorframe. There were also drops of blood across the bathroom tiles, on the cabinet next to the sink and on the cabinet handle. He said some of the drops appeared to have fallen while the victim was sitting or possibly crawling, and some may have been coughed up.\n\nMore alarmingly, Balaji\u2019s mother Poornima Ramarao said a private autopsy she paid for showed that the victim was shot from above, with the bullet entering above his nose and lodging just below the back of his skull. She said the bullet completely missed his brain and he bled for 15-30 minutes to death at the bathroom door.\n\nFurthermore, the autopsy showed that Balaji had a second trauma wound on the side of his head. His parents have theorised that the victim was attacked from behind while he was listening to music and cleaning his teeth, and his head smashed into the wall or cabinet.\n\nAfter fighting back, Balaji was likely pulled up onto his knees or sitting down, and shot in the head. As the wound wasn\u2019t fatal, he survived for some minutes and got out of the bathroom before dying from blood loss. The deceased engineer\u2019s father said the apartment was ransacked because the killer was looking for a storage device that had damning evidence on it.\n\nBalaji\u2019s gun, a Glock pistol that records show he bought on January 4, 2024, was found near his body, along with a box of 9mm ammunition in his closet with six rounds missing. One of the rounds was found in the gun case, which included the record of sale, another four elsewhere, and one unaccounted for.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nBalaji\u2019s father Ramamurthy said he was the last person to speak to the victim in a phone call on November 22. \u201cHe was happy, he didn\u2019t show any depression. He had just returned, and in the end he said, \u2018I\u2019m going for dinner, I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u2019 Usually, he goes out for dinner,\" said Ramamurthy.\n\nBalaji was outspoken about the ethical and legal concerns he encountered during his tenure at OpenAI. In an interview with The New York Times shortly before his death, he claimed that the company\u2019s AI models had been trained on copyrighted material scraped from the internet without proper authorisation.\n\nLocation : San Francisco, California, USA\n\nFirst Published: January 26, 2025, 13:31 IST"

Reforms of such magnitude require an audacity of vision,\u201d she said.\n\nHighlighting the significance of the proposed bill aimed at synchronising election schedules across the country, Murmu noted, \u201cThe \u2018One Nation One Election\u2019 plan can offer numerous benefits, including enhanced governance and reduced financial strain.\u201d In discussing legal reforms, she pointed out the need to replace the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Indian Evidence Act with new laws reflective of Indian traditions.\n\nShe mentioned the introduction of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, which prioritise the delivery of justice over mere punishment and place a strong emphasis on addressing crimes against women and children.\n\nReflecting on the significance of the Constitution, the President highlighted the progress achieved over the past 75 years.\n\n\u201cAt the time of Independence, many parts of the country faced extreme poverty and hunger. However, we maintained a belief in ourselves and created conditions for growth,\u201d she said.\n\nNoting the contributions of farmers and labourers, she said India\u2019s economy now plays a pivotal role in global economic trends, asserting that this transformation is rooted in the framework established by the Constitution.\n\nThe President also pointed to the persistently high economic growth rate in recent years, which has generated job opportunities, increased income for farmers and labourers, and lifted many out of poverty.\n\nShe underscored the importance of inclusive growth and the government\u2019s commitment to welfare, making basic necessities such as housing and access to clean drinking water entitlements for citizens.\n\nEfforts to support marginalised communities, particularly those belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC), were also highlighted.\n\nMurmu mentioned various initiatives, including pre-matric and post-matric scholarships, national fellowships, and dedicated schemes aimed at the socio-economic development of these communities, such as the Pradhan Mantri Anusuchit Jaati Abhyuday Yojana and the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan.\n\nThe President\u2019s address underscored the government\u2019s commitment to fostering inclusive growth and redefining governance standards in the country, creating a vision for a more equitable and prosperous future for all citizens.\n\nShe emphasised that this occasion is a collective celebration of joy and pride for all citizens and remarked that while 75 years may seem like a brief moment in the life of a nation, it has been a significant period for India, marked by the revival of its long-dormant spirit and its journey to reclaim its rightful status among the world\u2019s civilisations.\n\nReflecting on India\u2019s historical journey, she urged citizens to remember the brave souls who sacrificed their lives for the nation\u2019s freedom, highlighting the 150th birth anniversary of Bhagwan Birsa Munda, whose contributions to the freedom movement are now receiving due recognition.\n\nThe President praised the early 20th-century freedom fighters for uniting the nation in a well-organised independence movement and credited iconic figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, and Babasaheb Ambedkar for helping India rediscover its democratic values.\n\n\u201cJustice, liberty, equality, and fraternity are not just modern concepts; they have always been integral to our civilisational heritage,\u201d she asserted, noting that skeptics of the Constitution\u2019s future were proven wrong.\n\nMurmu highlighted the inclusive nature of the Constituent Assembly, which represented diverse communities across the nation, including 15 women members who played pivotal roles in shaping the country\u2019s democratic framework.\n\n\u201cWhen women\u2019s equality was a distant goal in many parts of the world, Indian women were actively engaged in the nation\u2019s destiny,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Constitution, according to the President, has evolved into a living document that serves as the foundation of India\u2019s collective identity and has guided the nation\u2019s progress over the past 75 years.\n\nShifting focus to present-day advancements, she highlighted the government\u2019s emphasis on physical infrastructure development, which has laid the groundwork for sustained growth.\n\nShe commended the innovative use of technology in finance, noting that digital payment systems and direct benefit transfers have enhanced inclusion and transparency in the economy.\n\nThe health of the banking system has improved due to reforms like the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which significantly reduced non-performing assets in commercial banks.\n\nLooking towards the future, the President underscored the importance of education in shaping the next generation.\n\nThe government has increased investments in the education sector, resulting in substantial improvements in learning quality and digital inclusion, especially in regional languages.\n\nMurmu noted that women teachers have played a crucial role in this educational transformation, with over 60 percent of new teachers being women As India marches confidently towards the future, the President affirmed that the dreams of today\u2019s youth, particularly young women, will shape the nation by the time it celebrates a century of independence.\n\nShe expressed hope that future generations will recognise the pivotal role of the Constitution in guiding their journey.\n\nQuoting Mahatma Gandhi, she reiterated the importance of morality in governance and civic life, stating, \u201cIf Swaraj was not meant to civilize us, it would be nothing worth.\u201d\n\nThe President called for a renewed commitment to Gandhiji\u2019s ideals of truth, nonviolence, and compassion - not just towards fellow humans but also towards nature.\n\nShe urged all citizens to reaffirm their dedication to realising the dreams of a prosperous, inclusive, and morally conscious India as the country looks forward to its future.\n\n30 unsung heroes awarded Padma Shri\n\nA 100-year old freedom fighter from Goa, a Dhak player from West Bengal who trained 150 women in the male-dominated field and India\u2019s first woman puppeteers, who is 96.

Now, by granting them full ownership rights and aligning with the Ministry of Housing\u2019s regulations and Delhi\u2019s by-laws, we will give them the right to construct and sell.\u201d\n\nOwnership rights would also be granted to those staying in refugee colonies, such as Rajendra Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, and Kingsway Camp, established post-Partition, he said.\n\nThe BJP leader added that over 13,000 shops in the capital had been sealed [for various violations]. The party would work with lawyers to find a legal path to reopen them within six months.\n\nThe party also promised an investment of \u20b920 crore to develop an integrated public transport network and convert 13,000 buses into electric buses, to make Delhi an 100% electric bus city under the BJP government. The practice of manual scavenging would be abolished, he said.\n\nHighlighting initiatives to promote tourism in the capital, the BJP has promised a collaborative Mahabharata corridor with the Uttar Pradesh and Haryana governments and a Yamuna riverfront similar to the Sabarmati riverfront in Gujarat. Shah said \u201cI would like to invite AAP Chief Arvind Kejriwal to join us after three years of our government to take a dip in the Yamuna with his family.\u201d\n\nThe party leader further said if not for the Central government\u2019s investments of \u20b941,000 crore on building roads, \u20b915,000 crore on laying railway lines, and \u20b921,000 crore on airports in the capital, \u201cDelhi would have become uninhabitable for citizens.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s first and second manifestos, released by BJP president J.P. Nadda and Lok Sabha MP Anurag Thakur respectively promise \u20b92,500 per month for women, free education from KG to PG, implementation of all Central government schemes, welfare boards for auto-rickshaw, taxi, e-rickshaw drivers and domestic workers. The BJP\u2019s manifesto includes over 20 promises for the capital.\n\nAAP chief Arvind Kejriwal described the BJP manifesto as \u201cold promise\u201d. In posts on X, he said \u201cThis is the same promise that the Prime Minister made in 2015 and 2020...You don\u2019t even hesitate to lie so openly. False promises in every election?\u201d\n\nHe said Shah always hurled abuses at him. \u201cWill abusing me lead to development of Delhi,\u201d he asked. The BJP had no vision for Delhi and had conceded defeat, Kejriwal said.\n\nHitting out at the BJP, Jangpura candidate and former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia dubbed \u201cBJP\u2019s \u2018Sankalp Patra\u2019 yet another \u201cJumla [hollow promise] Patra\u201d. Questioning the promise of 50,000 jobs in a city with 2.5 crore residents, the senior AAP leader slammed Shah for \u201cmocking Delhiites\u201d and contrasted the BJP\u2019s claims with \u201cMr. Kejriwal\u2019s record of creating over 12 lakh jobs post-COVID\u201d.\n\n\u201cDelhi needs lakhs and crores of jobs, not hollow promises,\u201d he said, urging Mr. Shah to focus on ensuring the safety of Delhi\u2019s residents, including women and traders, instead of peddling empty rhetoric.\n\nSisodia pointed out, \u201cDelhi has a population of 2.5 crore people, and you are saying you will create 50,000 jobs. What about the rest, what will they do? This means you have no plan, no vision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen Amit Shah promised that shops would be unsealed. Who has been sealing shops for the past 20 years? Who has been snatching the livelihoods of poor shopkeepers? For the last 20 years, and especially in the past five-seven years, BJP leaders have been at the forefront of sealing shops. When AAP leaders opposed it, no one listened to them. Recently, after the AAP came to power in Delhi, when AAP leaders went to unseal the shops, BJP leaders stood in opposition, ensuring that it was not lifted.\u201d\n\nHe further added, \u201cAmit Shah said the BJP will bring electric buses to Delhi. Perhaps your team didn\u2019t brief you here either. Delhi has already become the e-bus capital, not just in India but globally. Delhi has the largest fleet of e-buses in the world. No other city in the world has as many e-buses as Delhi. What new things are you promising?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know very well that your government is not going to be formed. So, you are merely copying and pasting Arvind Kejriwal\u2019s promises. You keep cursing Arvind Kejriwal in your press conferences, but in the end, you are the promising works he has already done,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Assembly election is set to see a close contest between the AAP, BJP and the Congress. While the AAP is hoping for a third term, and the Congress an entry into the capital after getting no seats for over two terms, the BJP is pushing hard to form a government after being out of power for nearly 28 years.\n\nFIITJEE owner among 12 booked for closure of centres in Delhi-NCR\n\nThe owner of FIITJEE and 11 others have been booked on a complaint by the parents of the coaching institute\u2019s students after several of its centres in Delhi-NCR shut down, police said on Saturday.\n\nFIITJEE founder D.K. Goyal, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Rajiv Babbar, Chief Operating Officer (COO) Manish Anand and its Greater Noida branch head Ramesh Batlesh have been named in the FIR, a Noida Police spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cBased on the complaint of parents, a case has been registered on charges of criminal conspiracy and breach of trust,\u201d Deputy Commissioner of Police (Noida) Rambadan Singh said.\n\nOn Friday, students and parents said several FIITJEE centres have unexpectedly shut down across Delhi-NCR and many teachers have resigned allegedly due to non-payment of salaries for months.\n\nFIITJEE provides coaching for competitive exams to engineering aspirants and has 73 centres across the country.\n\nCiting the complaint of Satsang Kumar, a resident of Greater Noida, the Noida Police spokesperson said that the institute\u2019s centre in Noida, Sector-62 was open till Tuesday but closed an hour before schedule. Later, it was found that the centre had been completely closed. He claimed that more than two thousand students studied at the centre.\n\nSimilar allegations have also been made by Manoj Kumar, a resident of Sector Omega-2 of Greater Noida.\n\nThe abrupt closure of FIITJEE centres has left many students and their parents, who have paid fees running into lakhs of rupees, in the lurch.\n\nGaza ceasefire: Hamas frees 4 female Israeli soldiers; Israel releases 70 Palestinians\n\nHamas militants handed over four captive female Israeli soldiers to the Red Cross in Gaza City on Saturday after parading them in front of a crowd. Israel followed with the release of the first 70 of 200 Palestinian prisoners or detainees due to be set free as part of the fragile ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe four smiled broadly as they waved and gave the thumbs-up from a stage in Gaza City\u2019s Palestine Square, militants on either side of them and a crowd of thousands watching, before they were led off to waiting Red Cross vehicles. They were likely acting under duress, with previously released hostages saying they were held in brutal conditions and forced to record propaganda videos.\n\nIsrael meanwhile released 70 Palestinian prisoners who will not be allowed to return to the Gaza Strip or West Bank, according to Egypt\u2019s state-run Qahera TV, which said they had arrived on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egypt served as a key mediator in more than a year of talks that led to the truce agreement.\n\nAs the four soldiers were released, hundreds of people cheered in Tel Aviv\u2019s Hostages Square where they were watching the drama unfold on a big screen television.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speechless,\u201d said Aviv Bercovich, one of the onlookers. \u201cI had goosebumps watching them. I just want the war to end.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office later released a video showing the freed hostages being welcomed at an Israeli army base. One of them, Liri Albag, smiled, gave two thumbs up and made a heart shape with her hand before getting into a van.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s office later said that Arbel Yehoud, a civilian hostage held by Hamas, was supposed to have been released Saturday. It said Israel would not allow Palestinians to begin returning to northern Gaza, which had been expected to begin by Sunday, until she is freed.\n\nA senior Hamas official said the group has informed mediators that Yehoud will be released next week.\n\nMeantime, an Egyptian official involved in the negotiations called the matter a \u201cminor issue\u201d that mediators are working to resolve. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nThe crowds in Tel Aviv and also in Gaza City began gathering early in the day in anticipation of the second such exchange between Israel and Hamas since a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip last weekend. The excitement in Israel was palpable, with TV stations filled with live reports from smiling news anchors and reporters interviewing ecstatic friends and relatives of the hostages.\n\nThe truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and the militant group. The fragile deal has so far held, quieting airstrikes and rockets and allowing for increased aid to flow into the tiny coastal territory.\n\nWhen the ceasefire started Sunday, three hostages held by the militants were released in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children.\n\nThe four Israeli soldiers, Karina Ariev, 20, Daniella Gilboa, 20, Naama Levy, 20, and Albag, 19, were captured in Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war.\n\nIn exchange, Israel was to release 200 prisoners, including 121 who were serving life sentences, according to a list released by Hamas.\n\nThe more notorious militants being released include Mohammad Odeh, 52, and Wael Qassim, 54, both from east Jerusalem. They were accused of carrying out a series of deadly Hamas attacks against Israelis, including a bombing at a cafeteria at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2002 that killed nine people, including five U.S. citizens.\n\nThe four soldiers released were taken from Nahal Oz base near the border with Gaza when Palestinian militants overran it, killing more than 60 soldiers there. The female abductees had all served in a unit of lookouts charged with monitoring threats along the border. A fifth female soldier in their unit, Agam Berger, 20, was abducted with them but not included in the list.\n\n\u201cThis is huge,\u201d said Gaza City resident Radwan Abu Rawiya, one of thousands who watched the hostages turned over in Palestine Square.\n\n\u201cPeople forgot about the war, destruction and are celebrating,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a televised statement, Israel\u2019s Army spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari confirmed the released hostages were in Israeli hands and on their way home, while criticizing what he called the \u201ccynical\u201d public display of the young women by Hamas before their release.\n\nHe also said that Israel is concerned about the fate of the two youngest hostages \u2014 Kfir and Ariel Bibas \u2014 and their mother Shiri. Kfir Bibas marked his second birthday in captivity earlier this month.\n\nHagari said the army is committed to bringing all hostages home.\n\nIsrael had been expected to begin pulling back from the Netzarim corridor \u2014 an east-west road dividing Gaza in two \u2014 and allowing displaced Palestinians in the south to return to their former homes in the north for the first time since the beginning of the war.\n\nBut that appears to be on hold pending the release of Yehoud.\n\nThe Hamas-run Interior Ministry said earlier said that displaced Palestinians will be allowed to return to northern Gaza starting Sunday (January 26, 2025). The Ministry, which oversees police forces, said Palestinians will be able to move between southern and northern Gaza on foot through the coastal Rashid road.\n\nWhat happens after the deal\u2019s initial six-week phase is uncertain but many hope it will lead to the end of a war that has levelled wide swaths of Gaza, displaced the vast majority of its population and left hundreds of thousands of people at risk of famine.\n\nThe conflict began with a cross-border attack led by Hamas on October 7, 2023, when Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 others hostage.\n\nMore than 100 hostages were freed in a weeklong truce the following month. But dozens have remained in captivity for over a year with no contact with the outside world. Israel believes at least a third of the more than 90 captives still inside Gaza were killed in the initial attack or died in captivity.\n\nWhile many rejoiced in Tel Aviv\u2019s Hostage Square after the four soldiers were released Saturday, some worried about the fate of those still in captivity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard that she\u2019s still there,\u201d said Yoni Collins, a family friend of Berger, the fifth female soldier taken from Nahal Oz base.\n\n\u201cThere were five girls, four are out and now she\u2019s there alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just waiting for her to come home.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s air and ground war, one of the deadliest and most destructive in decades, has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not say how many were militants. They say women and children make up more than half the fatalities.\n\nAustralian Open 2025: Sparkling Madison Keys stuns Aryna Sabalenka to claim maiden Grand Slam title\n\nAmerican Madison Keys produced an inspired display to dethrone top seed Aryna Sabalenka at the Australian Open and capture her maiden Grand Slam title with a battling 6-3 2-6 7-5 victory in the final on Saturday.\n\nThe 29-year-old became the fourth-oldest first-time Grand Slam champion in the professional era after Flavia Pennetta, Ann Jones and Francesca Schiavone, and her win ended Sabalenka\u2019s bid for a third straight Melbourne Park crown.\n\nSabalenka made a couple of double faults to drop serve in the opening game and looked off colour in the early exchanges as the free-hitting Keys heaped pressure on the top seed with a dipping crosscourt winner en route to a double break.\n\nThe American 19th seed rode her luck after a net cord winner and went up 5-1 in 20 minutes before conceding a break with a wayward backhand before Sabalenka gifted her set point with a fourth double fault.\n\nKeys, who was hitting much harder than her opponent on both flanks, fired her 11th winner with a backhand down the line to clinch the opening set but Sabalenka began to mix up her game in the next set and sliced her way through to level the match.\n\nBoth players relied on their powerful serves and shot-making to remain level until 5-5 in the decider but there was one final momentum shift as Keys produced some blistering winners to claim the next two games and the biggest triumph of her career.\n\nIn Brief:\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has cleared Mumbai-attack convict Tahawwur Rana\u2019s extradition to India, dismissing his review petition against the move. Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana is accused of playing a major role in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in India. Rana, 63, has been incarcerated in a Los Angeles prison since the extradition request by India was accepted by the U.S. He faces several criminal charges for his role in the Mumbai terror attacks."

            "article_content": "Discovery of magnetic signals from ocean tides\n\nHow ESA\u2019s Swarm satellites detect hidden ocean signals\n\nAlso Read:\n\nScientists have uncovered something extraordinary hidden in the rhythmic rise and fall of Earth's tides: mysterious magnetic signals that may rewrite how we think about the inner workings of the planet. For centuries, people have admired tides for their predictability, beauty, but there is something that lies beneath the surface of these waters and is quietly shaping our world. This groundbreaking discovery promises to open new doors in geophysics, revealing the most intricate details about Earth's magnetic field , never seen before. How were these signals discovered, and what secrets might they hold? As researchers dig deeper, the implications could range from improving global navigation systems to unlocking clues about our planet's evolution. The tides, it seems, have much more to tell.Scientists have detected the weakest magnetic signals produced by Earth's ocean tides, opening up new windows into the inner workings of the planet. These faint signals, recorded by satellites in very low orbits, are produced as seawater flows through Earth's magnetic field, creating weak electric currents. Researchers analyzed data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Swarm mission to successfully interpret these elusive signals.Published 2 December 2024, scientists have made this new discovery after the ocean tide can tell what's beneath them in terms of magma. Here is the part where the findings of Alexander Grayver, from the University of Cologne, an author and leader of scientific research, mention that it will be the lowest signals that these swarms ever sense.The European Space Agency consists of three satellites launched in 2013. Its mission was to complete the study about Earth's magnetic field in the year 2017, but it was further extended due to its huge contribution to science, and it did so gradually at the expense of atmospheric drag causing the orbit lowering of the spacecraft.The recent study also had the advantage of a solar minimum, a period during which there is a decrease in solar activity approximately every 11 years. This means that interference from the Sun's electromagnetic radiation and charged particles decreases, so a satellite might sense the minute signatures of magnetic waves that exist on Earth.Swarm is anticipated to be operational up to 2030 which will coincide with the next solar minimum, potentially providing yet another unique opportunity to look for hidden oceanic signals. \"This extended mission has allowed scientists to answer new and unexpected research questions\", says mission manager Anja Str\u00f8mme."

            "article_content": "For the first time, researchers have measured the shape of an electron as it moves through a solid. This achievement could open a new way of looking at how electrons behave inside different materials.\n\nTheir discovery highlights many effects that could be relevant to everything from quantum information science to electronics manufacturing.\n\nThose findings come from a team led by physicist Riccardo Comin, MIT\u2019s Class of 1947 Career Development Associate Professor of Physics and leader of the work, in collaboration with other institutions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve essentially developed a blueprint for obtaining some completely new information that couldn\u2019t be obtained before,\u201d says Comin. His colleague and co-author, Mingu Kang, performed much of this research at MIT before continuing at Cornell University.\n\nNew angles on electron shape\n\nPhysicists have examined electrons for decades, but the wave-like aspect of these particles brings extra complexity. Electrons can be described not just as small points, but also as \u201cwave functions.\u201d\n\nThese wave functions look like shapes or surfaces in higher-dimensional spaces. Sometimes these shapes are relatively simple. Other times, they\u2019re tangled and tricky to measure.\n\nBy using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, or ARPES, the team recorded details about how electrons behaved as light hit them.\n\nARPES helped them pin down a previously elusive property of electrons that holds the key to better understanding their geometry.\n\nWhy electron shape matters\n\nIn usual settings, we talk about an electron\u2019s energy or velocity. Those are familiar concepts. Geometry, on the other hand, points to the patterns or forms that electron waves can take when arranged in a solid.\n\nQuantum geometry affects how these particles interact, pair up, and even give rise to unusual behaviors. One example is superconductivity, where electrons zip along a material without resistance.\n\nAnother is when electrons form orderly patterns, a bit like a collection of synchronized dancers. Observing geometry could help scientists design new materials with novel electronic traits.\n\nThe kagome connection\n\nThe team measured this geometric effect in a class of materials called kagome metals. Kagome metals are named for a repeating pattern of atoms that resembles a series of interlocking triangles. This lattice structure can influence how electrons navigate and share energy.\n\nPhysicists have long found kagome metals interesting because they host special behaviors that aren\u2019t common in many other materials.\n\nObserving the geometry inside them could explain why electrons in these metals sometimes align in peculiar ways that set off advanced superconductivity or other strange effects.\n\nARPES and quantum shapes\n\nDuring ARPES experiments, researchers shine a beam of photons on a crystal. The light pushes electrons out of the material, allowing scientists to measure those electrons\u2019 angles and spins.\n\nBy gathering that data, they reconstruct how electrons inside the crystal are moving and what shapes they form.\n\nThis method is demanding because it requires intricate equipment and specialized facilities. Yet it gives a unique window into what happens on distances smaller than a billionth of an inch.\n\nApplications and potential benefits\n\nA precise measurement of quantum geometry can lead to progress in areas that rely on electron control. Quantum computing, for instance, depends on maintaining stable electronic states while performing computations.\n\nResearchers want materials that can reliably keep these states without unwanted disruptions. If scientists understand and possibly design the geometry of electrons, they might improve superconductors or even develop electronic devices that lose very little energy through heat.\n\nWith energy efficiency becoming ever more critical, there\u2019s real value in controlling electron flow on such tiny scales.\n\nInsights from global teamwork\n\nThis study was a partnership among institutions spanning different parts of the world. Collaborators brought together theoretical and experimental backgrounds.\n\nTheir collective expertise made it possible to design, synthesize, and measure the electronic structure of a kagome metal.\n\nThe pandemic forced some members to work remotely, but it also enabled other team members to take on new roles in labs that were partially shut down.\n\nThat unexpected shift helped push the work forward and demonstrated how closely linked theory and experiment must be when tackling high-precision measurements.\n\nOne electron shape, many possibilities\n\nQuantum geometry is far richer than standard geometry we learn in everyday math. The shape of an electron\u2019s wave function isn\u2019t like a typical circle or a neat sphere. It can take on forms that twist and loop in higher dimensions.\n\nObserving that shape in a real material confirms predictions that theorists have pursued for a long time. It means those theoretical constructs describing wave functions have real, measurable consequences.\n\nAnd now, there is a proven route to measure them, so future studies might target exotic materials that exhibit other patterns or new behaviors.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nScientists plan to refine techniques like ARPES and adapt them to explore a range of materials. They hope to see how quantum geometry influences conductivity, magnetism, and other conditions that matter for practical applications.\n\nPhysicists also see promise in discovering how manipulating geometry might encourage electrons to swap their usual habits for more synchronized, cooperative behavior.\n\nThat synchronization is important for technologies that rely on controlling multiple electrons at once, such as quantum sensors or memory elements.\n\nExperts say these findings will likely inspire more ambitious experiments to uncover aspects of quantum geometry we haven\u2019t been able to measure before.\n\nWith each new result, materials researchers step closer to engineering designs for the electronic components of tomorrow. The electron might be tiny, but it\u2019s revealing secrets about shaping the future of technology.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Physics.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "A breakthrough discovery, the coins are worth around \u00a3258,000.\n\nThe discovery, made near the village of Holzthum in northern Luxembourg, includes 141 gold solidi, coins minted under the rule of nine Roman emperors between 364 and 408 AD. Found near the base of a burgus\u2014a fortified Roman watchtower used for military observation\u2014the coins are believed to have belonged to high-ranking military officers. \u201cThis is a major archaeological discovery, as it is extremely rare to study an intact ancient monetary deposit within its original archaeological context,\u201d announced Luxembourg's National Institute for Archaeological Research (INRA). The hoard\u2019s sheer size and exceptional condition have stunned researchers. Each solidus weighs around 4.5 grams of nearly pure gold, amounting to over 6 kilograms. Rebecca Usherwood, an Assistant Professor in Late Antique and Early Byzantine Studies at Trinity College Dublin, described the discovery as extraordinary.\n\nA Gallo-Roman site located in Echternach, Luxembourg.\n\n\u201cThis represents a huge amount of personal wealth for the individual or group who collected these coins,\u201d said Prof Usherwood. \u201cMost people in the Roman Empire would rarely, if ever, have seen a single gold coin. To find this many indicates the owner was of considerable social standing, likely a military officer rather than a common soldier.\u201d The coins, which were typically used for imperial gifts or military payments, are thought to reflect the site's strategic importance. The area where the hoard was found marked the edge of the Roman Empire, an area heavily fortified against external threats. Among the most notable coins are three bearing the image of Emperor Eugenius, who ruled for just two tumultuous years (392\u2013394 AD). Eugenius, supported by the Western Roman general Arbogast, attempted to revive pagan traditions but was defeated by the Christian Eastern Emperor Theodosius I at the Battle of Frigidus in 394 AD. Coins from Eugenius\u2019 brief reign are particularly rare, adding to the significance of the find. The solidi were uncovered during a series of excavations conducted between 2020 and 2024. Luxembourg\u2019s Army Mine Action Service was involved due to nearby unexploded ordnance from World War II. The discovery was kept secret for nearly four years to protect the site and its findings. Luxembourg law stipulates that the treasure\u2019s estimated value of $322,000 (\u00a3257,919) belongs to those with legal claims to the land.\n\nJust two of the hoard of Roman coins discovered.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "source": "Wired",
            "article_content": "On January 20, DeepSeek, a relatively unknown AI research lab from China, released an open source model that\u2019s quickly become the talk of the town in Silicon Valley. According to a paper authored by the company, DeepSeek-R1 beats the industry\u2019s leading models like OpenAI o1 on several math and reasoning benchmarks. In fact, on many metrics that matter\u2014capability, cost, openness\u2014DeepSeek is giving Western AI giants a run for their money.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s success points to an unintended outcome of the tech cold war between the US and China. US export controls have severely curtailed the ability of Chinese tech firms to compete on AI in the Western way\u2014that is, infinitely scaling up by buying more chips and training for a longer period of time. As a result, most Chinese companies have focused on downstream applications rather than building their own models. But with its latest release, DeepSeek proves that there\u2019s another way to win: by revamping the foundational structure of AI models and using limited resources more efficiently.\n\n\u201cUnlike many Chinese AI firms that rely heavily on access to advanced hardware, DeepSeek has focused on maximizing software-driven resource optimization,\u201d explains Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney, who studies Chinese innovations. \u201cDeepSeek has embraced open source methods, pooling collective expertise and fostering collaborative innovation. This approach not only mitigates resource constraints but also accelerates the development of cutting-edge technologies, setting DeepSeek apart from more insular competitors.\u201d\n\nSo who is behind the AI startup? And why are they suddenly releasing an industry-leading model and giving it away for free? WIRED talked to experts on China\u2019s AI industry and read detailed interviews with DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng to piece together the story behind the firm\u2019s meteoric rise. DeepSeek did not respond to several inquiries sent by WIRED.\n\nA Star Hedge Fund in China\n\nEven within the Chinese AI industry, DeepSeek is an unconventional player. It started as Fire-Flyer, a deep-learning research branch of High-Flyer, one of China\u2019s best-performing quantitative hedge funds. Founded in 2015, the hedge fund quickly rose to prominence in China, becoming the first quant hedge fund to raise over 100 billion RMB (around $15 billion). (Since 2021, the number has dipped to around $8 billion, though High-Flyer remains one of the most important quant hedge funds in the country.)\n\nFor years, High-Flyer had been stockpiling GPUs and building Fire-Flyer supercomputers to analyze financial data. Then, in 2023, Liang, who has a master's degree in computer science, decided to pour the fund\u2019s resources into a new company called DeepSeek that would build its own cutting-edge models\u2014and hopefully develop artificial general intelligence. It was as if Jane Street had decided to become an AI startup and burn its cash on scientific research.\n\nBold vision. But somehow, it worked. \u201cDeepSeek represents a new generation of Chinese tech companies that prioritize long-term technological advancement over quick commercialization,\u201d says Zhang.\n\nLiang told the Chinese tech publication 36Kr that the decision was driven by scientific curiosity rather than a desire to turn a profit. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to find a commercial reason [for founding DeepSeek] even if you ask me to,\u201d he explained. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not worth it commercially. Basic science research has a very low return-on-investment ratio. When OpenAI\u2019s early investors gave it money, they sure weren\u2019t thinking about how much return they would get. Rather, it was that they really wanted to do this thing.\u201d"

The company\u2019s share price touched an all-time low of INR 395 during the intraday trading on Friday (January 24). The stock got listed in December at INR 442.25 on the BSE, a 58.5% premium to the issue price of INR 279.\n\nMobiKwik announced on Friday, after market hours, that the cofounder and CEO of its payments division, Chandan Joshi, had tendered his resignation with immediate effect due to \u201cpersonal reasons and family commitments\u201d.\n\nThis week also saw multiple other new-age tech stocks touch fresh 52-week lows.\n\nAfter announcing its results for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2024-25 (Q3 FY25) on January 21, shares of online B2B marketplace IndiaMART InterMESH fell to a 52-week low of INR 2,064.10 on January 22.

We expect the pressure on paid subscriptions to sustain in the near term, thus limiting meaningful upside to collections growth,\u201d the brokerage said.\n\nFintech major Paytm also released its Q3 numbers this week. While it managed to narrow its consolidated net loss by 6% on a YoY basis to INR 208.5 Cr, its revenue from operations slipped 36% YoY to INR 1,827.8 Cr.\n\nFollowing this, the company\u2019s shares plunged 10.22% to end the week at INR 807.75. Besides the lukewarm financials, another development that fuelled the bearish sentiment was a report which said that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) was probing the fintech major, along with other payment gateways, in connection with a crypto scam linked to HPZ Token. However, Paytm, and the other companies, denied the allegations, but this still led to a near 9% decline in the Vijay Shekhar Sharma-led company\u2019s share prices on Friday.\n\nSaaS major Unicommerce ended the week 10.78% lower at INR 141.60 after touching an all-time low at INR 141.25 during the intraday trading on Friday. With this, the company\u2019s shares have now slipped 38.43% below its listing price of INR 230.\n\nBesides, shares of Delhivery, EaseMyTrip and FirstCry also touched fresh lows this week. Other losers this week included PB Fintech, Nykaa, Ola Electric, Swiggy, Zomato, among others.\n\nMeanwhile, Go Digit, TAC Infosec, RateGain, EaseMyTrip, MapmyIndia and DroneAcharya were the gainers this week, rising in a range of 0.14% to just under 8%. Of these, shares of cybersecurity firm TAC Infosec touched an all-time high at INR 1,697 on Friday. Its shares ended 6.07% higher this week.\n\nIn the broader market, Sensex fell 0.56% to 76,190.46 and Nifty 50 declined 0.48% to end the week at 23,092.20. The benchmark indices have gone down nearly 3% since January 1.\n\nIn its India Strategy Report 2025, \u20182025\u2014the pricey paradise; cloudy skies\u2019, BNP Paribas\u2019 head of India equity research Kunal Vora said that the weak start for the Indian markets in 2025 is due to rising US bond yields which have led to the strengthening of the US dollar and FII selling. Besides, the weak earnings reports from listed entities for the December quarter have also been a cause of concern.\n\n\u201cThough DII holdings are rising, India is not immune to FII selling as FII holdings are still 1.6X that of DIIs. Locally, earnings growth has slowed across sectors as the benefits of the post-pandemic reopening and commodity tailwinds are now behind. Slowing corporate tax and GST collections could constrain the government\u2019s ability to stimulate the economy while maintaining fiscal discipline,\u201d he added.\n\nMoving forward, Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, believes that uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s economic policies and high valuations may impact the stock market in the short term. He said that while the Q3 results are broadly in-line with expectations, they are not helping the market which is following the sell-on-news trend.\n\n\u201cKey events, such as the FOMC meet and Union Budget, will influence market sentiment. While the FOMC maintains a hawkish stance, Trump\u2019s push for rate cuts can add a positive undertone in the future. Expectations for the Union Budget remain subdued; however, the conclusion of this major event without any negative surprises could help alleviate market concerns,\u201d he added.\n\nFurther, he opined that the Indian market seems to be in the final phase of consolidation. He highlighted that India\u2019s GDP growth is expected to accelerate and expected to increase to 7% in FY26 from 6.4% in FY25. In line with this economic improvement, earnings growth for Indian companies is also expected to revert to the long-term historical average of 15% by FY26.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a deeper look at the performance of some of the new-age tech stocks this week.\n\nA Tough Week For Zomato\n\nShares of foodtech major Zomato plummeted 13.25% this week to end at INR 215.80. The downward trend in the stock began on Monday (January 20) after the company reported underwhelming financial numbers for Q3 FY25. Despite its top line growing 64% YoY to INR 5,405 Cr, its net profit dipped 57.2% YoY to INR 59 Cr.\n\nA slow down in the food delivery segment and rise in the loss of quick commerce vertical Blinkit dragged down the foodtech giant\u2019s profit.\n\nFor its core food delivery business, almost all key metrics \u2013 from gross order value to average monthly transacting users \u2013 were down sequentially.\n\nBrokerage ICICI securities pointed out that Zomato likely lost market share in the food delivery segment in the quarter amid rising competition. It attributed this potential decline to Zomato\u2019s rivals scaling up 10-15 minute food delivery business faster.\n\nMeanwhile, as a result of the rising competition in the quick commerce space, Blinkit\u2019s adjusted EBITDA loss surged about 13X YoY to INR 103 Cr. The vertical spent heavily on expanding its dark store network in the quarter, which also helped it double its revenue on a YoY basis in Q3 FY25.\n\nMeanwhile, Zomato\u2019s bid to make a mark in the 10-minute food delivery space has irked the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), which has warned of a legal action against the company and its rival Swiggy.\n\nIn response, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal reached out to restaurant partners to assuage their concerns. He said that Zomato will never compete with its own restaurant partners, adding that Bistro is neither a \u201cprivate label\u201d nor a \u201cZomato Kitchen\u201d.\n\nGo Digit Shines Post Upbeat Financial Results\n\nBuoyed by its impressive financial performance, insurtech major Go Digit General Insurance emerged as the top gainer this week. Its shares ended up 7.90% to end the week\u2019s trade at INR 314.10.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that the company\u2019s shares touched an all-time low at INR 276.80 on January 13.\n\nGo Digit\u2019s profit surged 176.46% to INR 118.52 Cr in Q3 FY25 from INR 42.87 Cr in the previous fiscal year, driven by strong revenue growth and controlled expenses.\n\nThe company\u2019s net written premium grew 5.13% YoY to INR 2,084.14 Cr. In the first nine months of FY25, Go Digit sold 0.9 Cr policies, served 6.2 Cr customers, and captured a 3.3% market share in the insurance sector.\n\nDespite the upbeat financials, brokerage firm Emkay reiterated its \u2018Sell\u2019 rating on Go Digit and revised the price target to INR 250."

            "article_content": "In November last year, an inter-ministerial committee of the Union government recommended that any dietary or nutritional supplements that claim to \u2018cure diseases\u2019 should be brought under the ambit of the Central Drug Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) and be classified as \u2018drugs\u2019.\n\nThe eight-member committee, headed by former health secretary Apurva Chandra, which was constituted in January last year, was supposed to decide whether nutraceuticals \u2014 which are currently regulated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) \u2014 should be scrutinised under CDSCO instead, and their pricing be decided by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA).\n\nThe panel\u2019s recommendation, as quoted in reports, read, \u201cFSSAI may regulate only nutritional and health claims that are listed under FSS (Advertising and Claims) Regulations, 2018, while the claim to cure or mitigate any specific disease, disorder or condition including disease risk reduction shall be regulated by CDSCO.\u201d\n\nAlso Read The hidden giant behind India\u2019s digital economy holds great potential as India\u2019s economy grows\u2026 What Trump 2.0 means for India? Vijay Kedia says\u2026 The Pharma Sector is Sitting on a Multibagger Opportunity\u2026 Three metal stocks to watch out for in this fearful market\n\nAlso Read How to reduce excess sebum on your face for clearer skin?\n\nInterestingly though, this is not the first time that the government has been mulling over categorising nutraceuticals differently. Multiple discussions on this have been held since 2015. As recently as August 2024, the state banned 156 combination drugs \u2014 including those administered as multivitamins \u2014 while also reviewing approvals for 34 other multivitamin supplements.\n\nThe need for regulation also comes as, in 2024, India\u2019s nutritional supplements market was said to be worth $30.37 billion, according to business consulting firm Grand View Research. It\u2019s expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6% between 2025-2030.\n\nThe Union ministry of food processing industries estimates that India\u2019s share in the global nutraceuticals market is close to 2%. As per a Deloitte report, US, Japan, and Europe control over 90% of the global market.\n\nWith nutritional supplements having such a big market share in India, and in the absence of regulations, products that might not be up to the mark could be escaping scrutiny.\n\nDr Pooja Tripathi, a public health expert, feels the panel\u2019s recommendations are a welcome step. She says, \u201cHealth and wellness are separate industries but the lines between them are being blurred because of no regulation and unqualified/uncertified people preaching to you the goodness of unsubstantiated supplements.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I prescribe any medicine to a patient, I do that based on their medical history, and formulate a proper dosage and duration for the drug. Wellness experts are simply promoting supplements without any guidelines. This is a dangerous environment where consumers are misled,\u201d adds Dr Tripathi.\n\nBut what is leading to this increased demand in the nutraceuticals market?\n\nShivam Puri, the managing director and CEO of Cipla Health, the consumer healthcare subsidiary of Cipla, says, \u201cThe \u2018illness to wellness\u2019 shift has contributed to a steady uptake for multivitamins post COVID, propelling a change in the consumption patterns from curative to preventive.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just tablets. Multivitamin gummies, powders, etc, are on the rise as well. Varun Khanna, co-founder of Fullife Healthcare and Fast&Up, a nutrition supplement brand, says, \u201cGummies, as a format, tend to be seen as a more niche, premium choice in India, and their widespread adoption may take another 5-10 years. On the other hand, formats like powders, effervescent tablets, and capsules resonate more with Indian consumers, proving to be a better fit for the market at present.\u201d\n\nGrowth potential\n\nWould the business of nutraceuticals be impacted though if they are brought under the ambit of the CDSCO?\n\nKhanna doesn\u2019t think so. He says, \u201cThe classification or governing authority does not directly impact sales. What matters most is consumer trust in product quality and safety.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Khanna believes that under more scrutiny, subpar products will leave the market, which will allow \u201chigh-quality supplements to stand out.\u201d\n\nPuri agrees: \u201cFactors such as high burden of lifestyle-induced chronic diseases, growing wave of health-consciousness, and increased awareness about the benefits of nutritional supplements will only boost further uptake.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, people across different demographics are actively choosing to consume nutraceuticals, says a Mintel Market Research report, estimating that close to 48% of working women and 33% of working men take supplements.\n\nIfs and buts\n\nHowever, given the rate at which the market size of nutritional supplements is increasing, the question arises whether we even need these supplements.\n\nDr Manisha Arora, director of internal medicine at Delhi\u2019s CK Birla Hospital(R), doesn\u2019t think so. She says, \u201cPeople should increase their intake of vitamins and nutrients via natural means like fruits and vegetables, instead of relying on supplements excessively. A healthy person does not need additional vitamin supplements.\u201d\n\nDr Pankaj Soni, principal director of internal medicine, Fortis Escorts Hospital, New Delhi, agrees, and says, \u201cVitamin supplementations should always be prescribed by a trained medical professional.\u201d\n\nThe experts add that people who might be vegan, pregnant, old, or have some health problems can go for supplements, but only with a doctor\u2019s prescription to understand their needs better.\n\nThe doctors also emphasise this because excessive intake of certain vitamins or nutrients can impact your health. For instance, says Dr Soni, excessive amounts of vitamin A in the body can lead to hypervitaminosis A which can cause symptoms like mild headaches, nausea, hair loss, blurred vision, even birth defects, liver abnormalities, and central nervous system disorders.\n\nOn the other hand, if excessive vitamin D accumulates in the liver, he explains that it can cause bone calcification, kidney stones, and weakness.\n\nDr Soni adds, \u201cPatients on anticoagulants/blood thinners or cholesterol-lowering medications should not take vitamin E supplements because mild vitamin E toxicity can cause nausea and digestive problems. Similarly, vitamin C is toxic at very high levels.\u201d\n\nExcess vitamin B6 in the body can lead to nerve damage and excess niacin intake can cause a burning sensation in the skin and damage your liver.\n\nDr Arora recommends, \u201cUnless your doctor prescribes supplements, eat multi-coloured fruits, salads, and green vegetables because they are nutrient rich.\u201d\n\nKnow your vitamins"

            "article_content": "In 2016, Herschel Hepler was browsing Google Images to practice his paleography \u2014 the study of historical writing systems \u2014 when he stumbled upon an eerily familiar photo that would lead to a groundbreaking discovery.\n\n\u201cI recognized it immediately and said, 'That\u2019s a manuscript in our collection,'\u201d Hepler, a curator at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, recalls.\n\nThe museum had recently acquired the manuscript \u2014 a rare Jewish prayer book \u2014 believing it to be part of the famous Cairo Geniza, a trove of ancient Jewish documents uncovered in a Cairo synagogue in the late 19th century.\n\nBut the black and white picture in Tablet magazine described the manuscript as a \u201c16th to 17th century Hebrew book of Psalms, said to be from the Bamiyan area\u201d of central Afghanistan.\n\nStunned by the revelation, Hepler set out to verify it. Tracking down the author of the Tablet article, British historian and archaeologist Jonathan Lee, Hepler confirmed that Lee had in fact found the book in an Afghan warlord\u2019s possession in 1998 and photographed the cover and two inside pages.\n\n\u201cWithout Jonathan\u2019s documentation from his trip to Bamiyan in 1998, we would still be assuming this is probably from the Cairo Geniza,\u201d Hepler said.\n\nBut if Hepler was surprised to learn about the book's origin in the remote mountains of Afghanistan, Lee was equally stunned when Hepler revealed that the manuscript had been carbon-dated to at least the 9th century.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I realized that the discovery was of major importance,\u201d Lee said via email.\n\nRecognizing their combined expertise \u2014 Hepler in Hebrew manuscripts and Lee in Afghan history \u2014 the duo joined forces and invited in other experts.\n\nTheir yearslong research not only established the manuscript as the oldest-known Hebrew book but also unearthed evidence that Jews had lived in Afghanistan \u2014 and along the ancient Silk Roads \u2014 for longer than historians previously believed.\n\nBut the thrill of discovery was dampened by the realization that the manuscript had probably been smuggled out of war-torn Afghanistan and bought on the antiquities market.\n\nAt the time, the museum, founded by the Green family, owners of the Hobby Lobby arts and craft company, was still reeling from its acquisition of artifacts smuggled from Iraq and Egypt.\n\nThe museum faced a significant challenge: Before it could showcase it to the world, it needed to legitimize its ownership of the manuscript. This required years of delicate negotiations with New York\u2019s small Afghan Jewish community and an Afghan government teetering on the brink of collapse. The stakes were high, and the path to secure the manuscript\u2019s rightful place in the museum would prove be too complex and demanding.\n\nLee\u2019s discovery\n\nLee, who has spent the better part of the last five decades researching and writing about Afghan history and archaeology, discovered the book by chance.\n\nIn April 1998, he was guiding a Japanese TV crew in Bamiyan and was on the lookout for a Bactrian language inscription and gold coins looted from an ancient Buddhist shrine.\n\nAt the time, the Bamiyan Valley, with its famed Buddha statues still standing, was controlled by a local Shiite insurgent group, while the Taliban ruled most of the rest of the country.\n\nThe anti-Taliban group\u2019s leader, Karim Khalili, kept a collection of antiquities, among them the cache of gold coins Lee had been looking for. Lee photographed them.\n\n\"Then, his [Khalili\u2019s] advisers brought in a miscellaneous collection of other antiquities that included the ALQ,\u201d Lee said, using the acronym for the \u201cAfghan Liturgical Quire,\u201d the Hebrew book in the Bible Museum\u2019s collection.\n\nA local man affiliated with the Shiite insurgent group had found the book under a collapsed roof in a cave the prior year and given it to Khalili.\n\nUnversed in Hebrew, Khalili apparently showed the book to other foreigners visiting Bamiyan, trying to figure out what it was.\n\n\u201cI was told it had been found in Bamiyan, but then everything is found in Bamiyan,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAs Lee recalls, the pocket-size book looked remarkably well-preserved for its age.\n\n\u201cThe cover was somewhat bent, damaged and watermarked, but the folios were relatively well-preserved, and most of the texts readable,\u201d he said.\n\nTo Lee, that suggested the manuscript was \"not that old.\u201d He left Afghanistan and for years didn\u2019t give it much thought.\n\nHow and when the manuscript left Afghanistan remains unknown.\n\nThe 1990s were a dark period for Afghanistan\u2019s rich cultural heritage. As armed groups fought over territory, their men \u2014 often directed by their commanders and guided by traffickers \u2014 plundered the country\u2019s vast archaeological sites and ransacked its museums. Seventy percent of the national museum\u2019s treasures vanished, according to one estimate, many ending up in private collections and some reputable institutions.\n\n\u201cThere is a long history of illicit export of antiquities from the country that goes back for decades but ultimately back to colonial times,\u201d said Cecilia Palombo, a University of Chicago professor who has researched the plunder of Afghan antiquities.\n\nA leading researcher with extensive experience in Afghanistan said the manuscript was likely taken out of the country after the Taliban overran Bamiyan in late 1998. The researcher spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nResearch by the Bible museum found that an unnamed Khalili deputy made multiple sales attempts in the United States and Europe between 1998 and 2001 before \u201capparently\u201d offloading it to a private collector in London in fall 2001. The collector kept it for a decade or more before Hobby Lobby bought it in 2013 and donated it to the museum.\n\nThe office of Khalili, who later served as a vice president, declined a VOA interview request.\n\nThe Tablet article\n\nAlthough Lee had found the book in Afghanistan, he didn\u2019t know how significant it was. On returning to England, he showed his photographs to a Hebrew specialist, who thought it was from the 16th or 17th century.\n\nThen, after a cache of ancient documents dubbed the \u201cAfghan Geniza\u201d surfaced on the international art market, Lee decided to publish his photograph, along with an article about Afghan Jewish history. Citing the book as an example of \u201cJewish material [turning up] occasionally\u201d in Afghanistan, he wrote that the \u201cwhereabouts of this manuscript is now unknown.\u201d\n\nHe would find out four years later. That's when, \u201cout of the blue,\u201d Hepler contacted him via LinkedIn and told him the manuscript was not the Book of Psalms but a prayer book, comprising Sabbath prayers, poetry and a partial Haggadah, the Jewish text recited at the Passover seder.\n\nThe Green family bought the book from an Israeli antiquities dealer in 2013 during a buying spree of ancient artifacts. Some of these items were later returned after it was discovered they had been illegally taken out of Iraq and Egypt.\n\nThe Afghan Liturgical Quire came with a forged provenance of its own, tracing the manuscript to collectors in London in the 1950s, masking any ties to Afghanistan. With Lee\u2019s documentation, the museum was able to correct its provenance.\n\nThe museum had initially thought the book was from the 9th century, but a second carbon-dating test performed in 2019 showed it dates to the 8th century, making it two centuries older than the previous oldest-known Hebrew book in the world.\n\nThe discovery electrified experts.\n\nFor Hebrew scholars, the discovery offered the earliest evidence of a bound Hebrew book.\n\nFor Afghanistan specialists, it highlighted \"how significant this region was in respect of the history of the Middle East, Inner Asia and Northern India, and Afghanistan's ancient connectivity with cultures and religious traditions,\" Lee said.\n\nYet the realization that it had been smuggled out of Afghanistan cast a cloud over its legitimacy.\n\nAfghan laws and the 1970 UNESCO Convention make it illegal to export cultural artifacts and heritage items without government approval.\n\nTo legitimize its custody of the manuscript, the museum adopted what it calls a \u201chuman rights-based approach\u201d to cultural heritage.\n\nInvoking the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the museum argued that the Afghan people and Afghan Jews living in New York have a right to access the manuscript.\n\n\u201cOne of the things this project is focused on is on access \u2014 so, access to the Afghan Jewish community, access to the people of Afghanistan,\u201d Hepler said.\n\nTo get the backing of both stakeholders, the museum initiated discussions with officials of the former Afghan government and members of the Jewish community in New York.\n\nThese efforts culminated in the signing of a memorandum of understanding in 2021 with the Afghan embassy in Washington before the Taliban takeover, ensuring the document would be held in custodianship.\n\nThe Afghan ambassador at the time, Roya Rahmani, did not respond to a request for an interview. Another former Afghan ambassador wrote a letter of support for the project.\n\nJack Abraham, head of the Afghan Jewish Federation who was born in Afghanistan, said his group offered its full support for keeping the manuscript in the United States.\n\n\u201cI told [Hepler], \u2018What you have in your hands is our heritage. It belongs to us. It could be any of our forefathers,\u2019\u201d Abraham said.\n\nBut some Afghans see it as equally part of their heritage.\n\n\u201cThis is the property of Afghanistan and must be returned to Afghanistan,\u201d a senior former government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nBarnett Rubin, a leading Afghanistan scholar and an advisor on the ALQ project, said both communities can legitimately lay claim to the book.\n\n\u201cThe museum wanted to have the approval of any one of the two main entities that might have a claim on it to their custody of it,\u201d Rubin said.\n\nWith a custodianship agreement secured, the museum launched an exhibit in September, celebrating the project as an interfaith collaboration among Jews, Christians and Muslims.\n\nA second exhibit is planned for New York starting this month.\n\nWhile the Bible Museum technically owns the manuscript, Hepler said Afghanistan and the Afghan Jewish community \"have a lot of agency in this custodianship.\" To that end, the museum plans to provide one high-quality replica to the Jewish community and three to major cultural institutions in Afghanistan."

Turritha, recorded in the late 19th century on the Lebanese side of the border, may correspond to Tirathas.\n\nThe resemblance of the names \u201ccan hardly be coincidental,\u201d they noted, though only \u201clarge heaps of basalt stones\u201d were documented at the time.\n\nThe search for Golgol, however, remains inconclusive.\n\nSome scholars believe a round hill near Abel Beth Maacah could hold the answer, though no definitive archaeological link has been made.\n\nThe boundary stone adds to a collection of over 20 similar finds in the northern Hula Valley, dating to a period of heightened Roman administrative control.\n\n5 Scientists say that the basalt stone served as a boundary marker under Roman rule Credit: Getty\n\n5 Israel, including the Galilee region (pictured) was under Roman Rule from 63 BC until 135 AD Credit: AFP\n\nThese markers were used to define land ownership, streamline taxation, and enforce imperial authority.\n\nThe artifact\u2019s placement in Galilee, where Biblical history and Roman governance collide, marks how ancient geography, economy, and culture are interconnected.\n\nIt comes after an ancient amulet once believed to have protected women and children from 'evil spirits' was also unveiled in the Biblical region of Galilee by archaeologists.\n\nThe 1,500-year-old artefact is called 'Solomon's Seal' and was found in northern Israel by a local resident living in the village of Arbel about 40 years ago.\n\nMeanwhile, a religious shrine sealed up by the ancestors of Jesus was discovered in the ancient heart of Jerusalem, frozen in time for nearly 3,000 years.\n\nCarved into the rock on the east slope of the City of David, near Temple Mount, the remarkably preserved structure comprises eight rooms containing an altar and a sacred standing stone\n\nAnd experts believe it may have featured in the Bible, because the partially-destroyed site lines up with the story of how Hezekiah \u2013 one of Jesus\u2019s paternal grandfathers \u2013 smashed idolatrous places of worship."

Tim Burchett has brought up his theory about underwater alien activity.\n\nTennessee Representative Tim Burchett has taken the trending extraterrestrial conversation to the depths of Earth\u2019s oceans.\n\nAccording to a report from WREG Memphis News Channel 3 (via The Hill), The Republican congressman has openly declared his belief that aliens might be operating secret underwater bases right here on our planet. Burchett\u2019s claims are now making waves in Washington and beyond due to the interesting intersection between religion and science that his beliefs clash on.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on former Rep. Matt Gaetz\u2019s One America News show, he clearly states that he arrived at this point base on his thought process of the unlimited power of the most high. \u201cI just think travelin\u2019 light years, I think it happens,\u201d Burchett said. Burchett also pondered the unimaginable distances aliens might travel to reach Earth.\n\n\u201cThe light from those stars that we see at night left there before the time of Christ,\u201d he added, mixing astronomy and theology in his explanation.\n\nBurchett\u2019s fascination with the unknown isn\u2019t new. Last year in April, following a classified briefing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), he hinted that the U.S. government is deliberately withholding information about these mysterious occurrences.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a cover-up,\u201d Burchett alleged. \u201cWe\u2019ve had departments tell us that they have recovery units, but they won\u2019t release full reports. Everything\u2019s covered up.\u201d\n\nThe congressman\u2019s interest in aliens gained momentum in the summer of 2023, when whistleblowers came forward during a series of UAP hearings. These insiders alleged that the government has long concealed evidence of advanced crafts of either foreign or extraterrestrial origin.\n\nBurchett took action by requesting the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general investigate these shocking claims. Burchett described one case that had him particularly spooked. \u201cWhen they tell me something\u2019s moving at hundreds of miles an hour underwater, and our capabilities\u2026and these things, this one was, it was large as a football field underwater,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this was a documented case, and\u2026and I have an admiral telling me this stuff.\u201d he said.\n\nBurchett has even led efforts to establish a UAP caucus in the House, joining a bipartisan group of lawmakers demanding greater transparency from the military on all things alien. With tens of millions spent on mysterious investigations, Burchett believes Americans deserve the full story\u2014even if it means unearthing secrets that sound straight out of a sci-fi movie.\n\nInterestingly, Burchett isn\u2019t the first U.S. lawmaker to explore the outer edges of plausibility. One prominent example of recent congressional conspiracy theories involves Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.). In 2018, she speculated about a secretive \u201cspace laser\u201d potentially being used to start wildfires in California.\n\nThe theory, which linked wildfires to a powerful and shadowy elite, was widely debunked and criticized but highlighted her willingness to amplify far-fetched claims. Her comments about various conspiracy theories, including QAnon, have sparked national debates and raised concerns about the influence of such ideas within government institutions."

For centuries, people have admired tides for their predictability, beauty, but there is something that lies beneath the surface of these waters and is quietly shaping our world. This groundbreaking discovery promises to open new doors in geophysics, revealing the most intricate details about Earth's magnetic field , never seen before. How were these signals discovered, and what secrets might they hold? As researchers dig deeper, the implications could range from improving global navigation systems to unlocking clues about our planet's evolution. The tides, it seems, have much more to tell.Scientists have detected the weakest magnetic signals produced by Earth's ocean tides, opening up new windows into the inner workings of the planet. These faint signals, recorded by satellites in very low orbits, are produced as seawater flows through Earth's magnetic field, creating weak electric currents. Researchers analyzed data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Swarm mission to successfully interpret these elusive signals.Published 2 December 2024, scientists have made this new discovery after the ocean tide can tell what's beneath them in terms of magma. Here is the part where the findings of Alexander Grayver, from the University of Cologne, an author and leader of scientific research, mention that it will be the lowest signals that these swarms ever sense.The European Space Agency consists of three satellites launched in 2013. Its mission was to complete the study about Earth's magnetic field in the year 2017, but it was further extended due to its huge contribution to science, and it did so gradually at the expense of atmospheric drag causing the orbit lowering of the spacecraft.The recent study also had the advantage of a solar minimum, a period during which there is a decrease in solar activity approximately every 11 years. This means that interference from the Sun's electromagnetic radiation and charged particles decreases, so a satellite might sense the minute signatures of magnetic waves that exist on Earth.Swarm is anticipated to be operational up to 2030 which will coincide with the next solar minimum, potentially providing yet another unique opportunity to look for hidden oceanic signals. \"This extended mission has allowed scientists to answer new and unexpected research questions\", says mission manager Anja Str\u00f8mme."

            "article_content": "For the first time, researchers have measured the shape of an electron as it moves through a solid. This achievement could open a new way of looking at how electrons behave inside different materials.\n\nTheir discovery highlights many effects that could be relevant to everything from quantum information science to electronics manufacturing.\n\nThose findings come from a team led by physicist Riccardo Comin, MIT\u2019s Class of 1947 Career Development Associate Professor of Physics and leader of the work, in collaboration with other institutions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve essentially developed a blueprint for obtaining some completely new information that couldn\u2019t be obtained before,\u201d says Comin. His colleague and co-author, Mingu Kang, performed much of this research at MIT before continuing at Cornell University.\n\nNew angles on electron shape\n\nPhysicists have examined electrons for decades, but the wave-like aspect of these particles brings extra complexity. Electrons can be described not just as small points, but also as \u201cwave functions.\u201d\n\nThese wave functions look like shapes or surfaces in higher-dimensional spaces. Sometimes these shapes are relatively simple. Other times, they\u2019re tangled and tricky to measure.\n\nBy using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, or ARPES, the team recorded details about how electrons behaved as light hit them.\n\nARPES helped them pin down a previously elusive property of electrons that holds the key to better understanding their geometry.\n\nWhy electron shape matters\n\nIn usual settings, we talk about an electron\u2019s energy or velocity. Those are familiar concepts. Geometry, on the other hand, points to the patterns or forms that electron waves can take when arranged in a solid.\n\nQuantum geometry affects how these particles interact, pair up, and even give rise to unusual behaviors. One example is superconductivity, where electrons zip along a material without resistance.\n\nAnother is when electrons form orderly patterns, a bit like a collection of synchronized dancers. Observing geometry could help scientists design new materials with novel electronic traits.\n\nThe kagome connection\n\nThe team measured this geometric effect in a class of materials called kagome metals. Kagome metals are named for a repeating pattern of atoms that resembles a series of interlocking triangles. This lattice structure can influence how electrons navigate and share energy.\n\nPhysicists have long found kagome metals interesting because they host special behaviors that aren\u2019t common in many other materials.\n\nObserving the geometry inside them could explain why electrons in these metals sometimes align in peculiar ways that set off advanced superconductivity or other strange effects.\n\nARPES and quantum shapes\n\nDuring ARPES experiments, researchers shine a beam of photons on a crystal. The light pushes electrons out of the material, allowing scientists to measure those electrons\u2019 angles and spins.\n\nBy gathering that data, they reconstruct how electrons inside the crystal are moving and what shapes they form.\n\nThis method is demanding because it requires intricate equipment and specialized facilities. Yet it gives a unique window into what happens on distances smaller than a billionth of an inch.\n\nApplications and potential benefits\n\nA precise measurement of quantum geometry can lead to progress in areas that rely on electron control. Quantum computing, for instance, depends on maintaining stable electronic states while performing computations.\n\nResearchers want materials that can reliably keep these states without unwanted disruptions. If scientists understand and possibly design the geometry of electrons, they might improve superconductors or even develop electronic devices that lose very little energy through heat.\n\nWith energy efficiency becoming ever more critical, there\u2019s real value in controlling electron flow on such tiny scales.\n\nInsights from global teamwork\n\nThis study was a partnership among institutions spanning different parts of the world. Collaborators brought together theoretical and experimental backgrounds.\n\nTheir collective expertise made it possible to design, synthesize, and measure the electronic structure of a kagome metal.\n\nThe pandemic forced some members to work remotely, but it also enabled other team members to take on new roles in labs that were partially shut down.\n\nThat unexpected shift helped push the work forward and demonstrated how closely linked theory and experiment must be when tackling high-precision measurements.\n\nOne electron shape, many possibilities\n\nQuantum geometry is far richer than standard geometry we learn in everyday math. The shape of an electron\u2019s wave function isn\u2019t like a typical circle or a neat sphere. It can take on forms that twist and loop in higher dimensions.\n\nObserving that shape in a real material confirms predictions that theorists have pursued for a long time. It means those theoretical constructs describing wave functions have real, measurable consequences.\n\nAnd now, there is a proven route to measure them, so future studies might target exotic materials that exhibit other patterns or new behaviors.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nScientists plan to refine techniques like ARPES and adapt them to explore a range of materials. They hope to see how quantum geometry influences conductivity, magnetism, and other conditions that matter for practical applications.\n\nPhysicists also see promise in discovering how manipulating geometry might encourage electrons to swap their usual habits for more synchronized, cooperative behavior.\n\nThat synchronization is important for technologies that rely on controlling multiple electrons at once, such as quantum sensors or memory elements.\n\nExperts say these findings will likely inspire more ambitious experiments to uncover aspects of quantum geometry we haven\u2019t been able to measure before.\n\nWith each new result, materials researchers step closer to engineering designs for the electronic components of tomorrow. The electron might be tiny, but it\u2019s revealing secrets about shaping the future of technology.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Physics.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Have you ever wondered how certain problems are so complex that even the fastest computers struggle to solve them? These types of problems are often found in industries like transportation, finance, healthcare, and science. They\u2019re called \u201coptimization problems,\u201d where the goal is to find the best solution out of many possible options.\n\nWhile regular computers (called \u201cclassical computers\u201c) are great for many tasks, they can have a hard time handling these massive challenges. Enter quantum computers.\n\nQuantum computers are an exciting new kind of technology that could change the way we solve difficult problems, especially Quantum Computing Problems. Instead of using regular computer bits (which are like tiny on/off switches), quantum computers use something called \u201cquantum bits,\u201d or qubits.\n\nQubits are super special because they follow the rules of quantum physics, which means they can process information in ways that classical computers can\u2019t. This makes quantum computers much more powerful at solving certain types of puzzles.\n\nWhat Are Optimization Problems?\n\nOptimization problems sound fancy, but you deal with them every day without even realizing it. Imagine you\u2019re trying to pick the fastest route to school on a map, or you\u2019re deciding how to spend your pocket money to get the best value. These are simple examples of optimization problems\u2014finding the best option out of many choices.\n\nNow imagine you work at an airport and have to decide the best way to schedule hundreds of flights, manage thousands of bags, and make everything run smoothly without delays. Or maybe you work for a delivery company and you want to find the most efficient way to deliver millions of packages across the country. These problems are way too complicated to solve with just guesswork!\n\nRegular computers try to solve these tough problems by testing every possible solution one by one, which can take an enormous amount of time. Even supercomputers may need days, months, or even years to do the job, depending on how big the problem is.\n\nWhat Makes Quantum Computers Different?\n\nQuantum computers are special because they use principles from quantum mechanics, a branch of science that studies the tiniest building blocks of our universe\u2014like atoms and particles. Unlike classical computers, which use bits that can be either 0 or 1, qubits can be in multiple states at once, thanks to something called \u201csuperposition.\u201d This allows quantum computers to look at many possible solutions simultaneously, instead of one by one.\n\nQuantum computers also use something called \u201centanglement,\u201d where qubits are connected in a way that lets them share information instantly. These features allow quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\n\nFor optimization problems, this means quantum computers can solve puzzles with millions (or even billions!) of possibilities in a fraction of the time it would take a classical computer.\n\nThis breakthrough is particularly exciting for industries like logistics, where the rise of technology has revolutionized traditional operations. If you interested in exploring this further, can check out our blog, \u201cF2000s and the Rise of Technology in Logistics,\u201d to learn how advanced computing and innovation are shaping supply chains globally.\n\nReal-Life Benefits of Quantum Computing in Optimization\n\nNow that we understand how quantum computers work, let\u2019s explore some real-life benefits for solving optimization problems.\n\n1. Faster Deliveries and Better Logistics\n\nHave you ever ordered something online and tracked its delivery route? Companies like Amazon or FedEx need to figure out the fastest and cheapest way to deliver packages to millions of customers. Using quantum computers, these companies could create better delivery plans in real time, saving money and ensuring you get your package as quickly as possible.\n\n2. Smarter Traffic Management\n\nTraffic jams are another optimization challenge. Cities around the world face growing traffic problems as more and more cars hit the roads. Quantum computing can help plan better traffic flows, reduce congestion, and make public transportation more efficient. This could save time, lower fuel usage, and reduce pollution!\n\n3. Improved Healthcare Scheduling\n\nHospitals deal with optimization problems all the time, like scheduling surgeries, assigning doctors, and managing beds for patients. Quantum computers could help hospitals make better schedules that improve patient care and reduce waiting times. This means more lives saved and a smoother healthcare experience.\n\n4. More Accurate Financial Predictions\n\nBanks and investment companies often deal with risky decisions, like where to invest money or how to predict market changes. These are complex optimization problems that involve analyzing a huge amount of data. Quantum computers could help make faster and smarter financial decisions, which could stabilize markets and improve the global economy.\n\n5. Advancing Science and Research\n\nFrom designing new medicines to improving renewable energy systems, scientists rely on optimization to solve tough problems. Quantum computers can speed up this research and bring us closer to breakthroughs in important areas like curing diseases or fighting climate change.\n\nChallenges and the Future of Quantum Computing\n\nQuantum computers sound amazing, but they\u2019re not perfect yet. Building and maintaining them is incredibly hard. They need to be kept in extremely cold environments and are still in the early stages of development. Right now, only a few companies and research labs have working quantum computers.\n\nStill, progress is happening quickly. Scientists and engineers are working hard to make quantum computers more powerful and accessible. Many believe that within the next 10 to 20 years, we\u2019ll see quantum computing become a common tool for solving real-world problems.\n\nWhy Should You Care About Quantum Computing?\n\nEven if you\u2019re not a scientist or an engineer, quantum computing is something exciting to keep an eye on. The benefits it could bring, from better technologies to smarter ways of solving problems, have the potential to impact nearly every part of our lives. Quantum computing could lead to a better, more efficient, and more sustainable future.\n\nThink of quantum computers like the superheroes of the technology world. They take on the toughest challenges and uncover solutions that normal computers just can\u2019t handle. And who knows? Maybe one day you\u2019ll be working on quantum computing or benefiting from its amazing advancements!\n\nQuantum computing may still sound like science fiction to some, but it\u2019s quickly becoming a reality. Its ability to solve advanced optimization problems could transform industries and improve the world in countless ways.\n\nThe possibilities are limitless, and we\u2019re just getting started!

Photo: Courtesy of NeuroXess\n\nPerhaps she never imagined that one day she would be able to communicate with others in this way. As a 43-year-old epilepsy patient hospitalized at Huashan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University, who asked to remain anonymous, with a brain tumor in the language area, she can now simply conceive the words she wants to say and the actions she wants to take in her mind, and through computer decoding, make them a reality.This marks a major advancement in a collaborative brain-computer interface (BCI) technology project between NeuroXess, a Shanghai-based life science company focusing on flexible electrode BCI technologies, and Huashan Hospital.With ongoing technical progress, goals like controlling actions and speech through thought are gradually becoming a reality in China.Technological breakthroughsIn 2024, multiple clinical trials based on partially-invasive and invasive BCI technologies were conducted in China.Based on real-time Chinese decoding, the patient mentioned above was able to synthesize Chinese speech through thoughts, drive digital avatar, interact with large language models, as well as convert language neural signals into commands to control dexterous robotic hands in real-time, Global Times learnt from NeuroXess.NeuroXess said that just two days after the surgery, the patient began training and, within seven days, attained a 71 percent accuracy in decoding for 142 commonly used Chinese syllables, and demonstrated a delay of under 100 milliseconds for single-character decoding.In December 2024, Hong Bo, a professor from the School of Medicine with Tsinghua University told Global Times that their partially invasive BCI device, NEO, would begin large-scale clinical trials in 2025, intended to recruit 30-50 patients suffering spinal injury for implantation. After completing these surgeries, the team plans to seek regulatory approval for market launch.The development of technology has facilitated the layout of industries. At the beginning of 2025, tech departments in cities like Beijing and Shanghai have been actively releasing action plans for the development of BCI technology, focusing on regulatory policies, clinical trials and industrial chain development, CCTV reported on January 14.Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission aims to break through key technologies by 2027, and by 2030, the BCI ecosystem will be in its early stages. Similarly, the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality focuses on medical-grade applications and strategic products, primarily promoting the deployment of invasive and partially invasive BCI technologies.Partially-invasive and invasive BCI technologies, due to their closer proximity to neurons, offer better spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratios, said Zhou Zhitao, Professor at the Shanghai Institute of Microsystems and Information Technology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to the Global Times.\"These paths are primarily used in serious medical fields, treating neuro-diseases that conventional medical methods cannot address, such as motor or speech disorders, helping patients regain basic life functions and improve their quality of life,\" Zhou said.\"Currently, the most likely scenario for large-scale application of BCI technology in China is for the treatment of neurological diseases after obtaining medical device registration. Neurological diseases often come with impaired functions, with the most common being motion and speech dysfunctions,\" Zhou said.\"In China, there are about 20 million patients with motor dysfunction and around 5.8 million with speech dysfunction. Once BCI receives medical device certification, it can serve this population,\" he added.Ethical challengesAt the same time, experts emphasized to the Global Times that BCI technology is still in its early stages and faces numerous challenges. It needs constant adjustments and balancing to ensure that the technology minimizes harm to patients and improves practical application outcomes.Zhou mentioned two key challenges for the future. \"One is how to quickly obtain medical device approval and conduct large-scale clinical trials to serve more people in need. The other is how to address privacy protection and medical ethics issues after large-scale BCI trials.\"Professor Mao Ying, president of Huashan Hospital affiliated with Fudan University, also emphasized to the Global Times the importance of the second challenge. \"Although BCI technology offers great rehabilitation opportunities for patients, we must remain cautious. If patients' brain data is not properly handled, it may lead to severe privacy leakage risks,\" Mao said.Additionally, Mao stressed that medical ethics demand that any innovative technology and clinical trial must adhere to the fundamental principle of \"do no harm to patients.\" \"Clinical research on high-precision technologies like BCI is not something that can be rapidly scaled up. In surgical practice, we need to continuously make precise pioneering efforts, and then keep refining and improving. If expectations are too high, patients may ultimately be disappointed, which could even cause psychological harm,\" he said.Besides suggesting the establishment of a regulatory mechanism for medical ethics, Mao also pointed out that public acceptance and understanding of this technology need to improve gradually to better promote its widespread use.\"Currently, BCI technology is mainly focused on treating clinical diseases, especially for patients with lost neural functions. Some people expect it to significantly enhance brain functions or replace traditional learning methods, however, BCI's clinical applications are still in the early stages, and there is a long way to go before full development is achieved.\"\"China, along with other major countries like the US, has the ability to integrate industrial chains and drive scientific research. China should actively participate in this field, maintaining its leading advantage and taking on the responsibility for technological development,\" Mao said. \"Our current start is good. If we don't try, we'll never reach the goal.\""
