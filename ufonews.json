            "article_content": "Before his upset win in the Wisconsin primary, most were ready to write Jimmy Carter off.\n\nEven into the early morning hours of April 7, 1976, the day after the election, Carter\u2019s Democratic opponent, Morris Udall, was projected to win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big win for my campaign,\u201d Udall told his backers earlier at the Marc Plaza Hotel in Milwaukee. \u201cOh, how sweet it is.\u201d In its early edition, the Milwaukee Sentinel\u2019s front page headline read, \u201cCarter upset by Udall.\u201d\n\nBut Carter came from behind to notch a 1% victory propelling him to the Democratic nomination and eventual presidency.\n\nThe victory came after Carter \u2014 and his family, including his mother, Lillian, and busloads of campaign workers known as the \u201cpeanut brigades\u201d \u2014 made numerous last-minute visits to Wisconsin, during which the Georgia peanut farmer was pelted with peanuts (in Madison) and also quizzed about UFOs (in Appleton, where he promised the local UFO center that if he was elected president, he would make public federal records on UFO sightings).\n\nIn the general election that year in Wisconsin, Carter beat Republican candidate Gerald Ford in a squeaker, 1,040,232 to 1,004,987.\n\nFour years later, Carter lost Wisconsin to Ronald Reagan, 1,088,845 to 981,584. In certain corners, Carter backers with long memories still bemoan the 160,657 votes Independent Party candidate John Anderson received in Wisconsin that year, helped by his running mate, former Democratic Wisconsin Gov. Patrick Lucey.\n\nCarter, however, made it clear he had a soft spot in his political heart for the state because of its support in 1976. He didn\u2019t return very often after that, but two of his dearest projects, Habitat for Humanity and Friendship Force, took root early in the state. Today, there are Habitat for Humanity chapters in more than 30 Wisconsin communities.\n\nBill Dixon, a colorful Wisconsin mover in the Democratic Party and coordinator of Carter\u2019s 1976 campaign in Wisconsin, recalls that the night Carter was elected it was Wisconsin\u2019s then-11 electoral votes that put him over the 270 needed to assure victory.\n\n\u201cHe was the greatest ex-president we ever had,\u201d Dixon said of his longtime friend.\n\n\u201cHe certainly had his quirks. But that win in 1976, that was when Wisconsin\u2019s primary was the Iowa of the United States. Wisconsin had the first open primary, it was the first Midwestern state primary, it was a great gauge of broad public opinion and very important for Jimmy to win. When he beat Udall here, there was no serious contender after that.\u201d\n\nA week before the election, even Carter had described his chances of beating Udall as \u201cunlikely.\u201d\n\nMadison resident John Anderson \u2014 not the 1980 candidate \u2014 remembers Carter\u2019s 1976 Wisconsin presidential campaign vividly.\n\n\u201cI was a fan when I met him as a kid,\u201d recalled Anderson, who worked in the state Capitol and has been a Madison resident since 1981. \u201cMy dad was involved in politics, but was not a big Carter fan. I had been following all of the primaries\u2019 results every Tuesday night, as it got closer and closer to Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cI had met him a week before the primary when his campaign did a touchdown in Eau Claire,\u201d said Anderson.\n\nWhen Carter won the primary, Anderson\u2019s dad did not think he would win the presidency. \u201cHe said if he wins, I will take you to the inauguration,\u201d said Anderson.\n\nThat January, Anderson and his dad took Amtrak to the inauguration. \u201cI was in the eighth grade. It was fantastic.\u201d\n\nWisconsin connections\n\nCarter made news in Wisconsin in April 1977 when he tapped Lucey to be U.S. ambassador to Mexico, a reward for Lucey\u2019s support in 1976. But the Carter-Lucey connection was quickly frayed, as Lucey quit the ambassador job in 1979 to join the Ted Kennedy presidential campaign. Then Lucey became John Anderson\u2019s running mate in the 1980 race against Carter.\n\nThat race brought Carter back to Wisconsin for campaign trips, but not enough to carry the state a second time.\n\nMany residents who remember Carter\u2019s visits to Wisconsin recall the peanut-pelting incident, from March 1976, when Carter campaigned in Madison. After a luncheon address at the Athens restaurant on Gilman Street, a crowd of anti-Carter demonstrators threw peanuts. A Secret Service agent had to shield Carter\u2019s head with a briefcase.\n\nThat was not the only crude behavior directed at candidates stopping in Madison that week. Sen. Henry Jackson was spat upon by a demonstrator at Dane County Regional Airport, and Alabama Gov. George Wallace was greeted at a luncheon speech by demonstrators wearing masks of Arthur Bremer, the man who attempted to assassinate Wallace in 1972. For years afterward, candidates for national office seemed to skip over Madison as a campaign stop.\n\nDuring his presidency, Carter occasionally hosted visitors from Madison \u2014 officially, from UW-Madison \u2014 at the White House, according to his presidential archives. Also in those archives are records of Carter\u2019s daily briefings that include Attorney General Griffin Bell\u2019s plans \u2014 detailed in a March 2, 1979, memo to Carter \u2014 to send \u201cseveral\u201d government lawyers to Madison to negotiate with The Progressive magazine editor Sam Day over the magazine\u2019s plans to publish an article on how to make an H-bomb.\n\nAnother appointment made by President Carter in 1977 was of a young associate professor of politics at Columbia University to be assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Donna Shalala would be hired as chancellor at the UW-Madison in 1988.\n\nCarter also visited Madison after his presidency, to boost the Friendship Force in 2000, when he invited conference participants to join him and wife Rosalynn in a jog along Lake Monona. About 40 admiring fans joined him that day, including one who told the Wisconsin State Journal: \u201cThat\u2019s the nice thing about the Carters. They\u2019re very open. Sometimes you don\u2019t find that when people climb the ladder.\u201d\n\nCarter never did release UFO records, as he promised the Appleton man during the 1976 campaign. Carter in 1973 had filed a report with the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, claiming \u2014 and repeating many times over the years \u2014 he had seen an unidentifiable light in October 1969, in Leary, Georgia, endearing him to yet another stratum of voters."

            "article_content": "Smaller artificial intelligence stocks have seemingly gone parabolic at the close of 2024, especially those that have been backed by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) in the form of an investment. Although Nvidia invested a mere $3.7 million in voice-AI start-up SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) about a year ago, that investment put SoundHound squarely on the map as a potential AI winner.\n\nAfter making several accretive acquisitions and racking up an impressive customer list, SoundHound's stock has soared in recent weeks.\n\nIs this price increase a signal that SoundHound could be the next \"killer app\" AI platform? Or is it a sign of a bubble waiting to burst?\n\nWhy SoundHound has made a big noise lately\n\nSoundHound appears to have achieved escape velocity as the go-to voice-enabled AI system outside big tech, especially within the automotive and quick-serve restaurant (QSR) verticals. SoundHound has landed seven of the top 20 QSR brands, including heavyweight Chipotle, for things like phone and drive-through ordering. In automotive, SoundHound's voice AI is now embedded in many leading auto brands such as those owned by car giant Stellantis, as well as four major electric vehicle manufacturers as of last quarter.\n\nIn addition to those two big verticals, this past summer's acquisition of Amelia, another voice-based start-up for enterprises, has boosted SoundHound's enterprise platforms both for customer service applications and employee-facing IT AI applications.\n\nWhy SoundHound has an early lead in voice AI\n\nWhile the generative AI craze has only been happening for two years, SoundHound has actually been around since 2005, and first released its Houndify voice AI platform 10 years later in 2015. So, the company has been developing this technology for a long time.\n\nWhile SoundHound does incorporate other third-party large language models into its products when necessary, it has distinguished itself by building its own proprietary model called Polaris. Polaris is built on its two decades of experience spanning billions of conversations and millions of hours of audio in dozens of languages.\n\nSoundHound has only been building Polaris since LLM training was available, but the platform is already in use for one-third of the company's restaurant ordering transactions, while management aims to eventually use Polaris in all of SoundHound's interactions across its platform.\n\nIn the age of AI, having proprietary data to build one's own model or augment a general-purpose LLM -- in this case, SoundHound's billions of voice transaction data going back decades -- should be a competitive advantage.\n\nStory Continues"

Most importantly he emphasized solving real-world problems.\n\nHe also prioritizes \u201cbuilding big, new business\u201d which could mean creating new business opportunities with AI, reflecting a strong focus on AI as the engine for innovation in 2025.\n\nGemini App\n\nPichai also cited Gemini App as a central focus for 2025, commenting that they\u2019re experiencing growth with Gemini and that scaling broader adoption of Gemini will be a focus in 2025. This aligns with the observation that Google is increasingly focusing on a Search-adjacent approach to consumer focused AI products and services.\n\nWhat this means for SEO is that we really need to start thinking in terms of a bigger picture of what Search means. Perhaps 2025 will be, after over 15 years of Google\u2019s departure from the ten blue links paradigm, that the SEO community thinks deeper about what search means when it\u2019s multimodal.\n\nPichai was quoted as saying:\n\n\u201cWith the Gemini app, there is strong momentum, particularly over the last few months\u2026 But we have some work to do in 2025 to close the gap and establish a leadership position there as well. \u2026Scaling Gemini on the consumer side will be our biggest focus next year.\u201d\n\nAI Products Will \u201cEvolve Massively\u201d\n\nThe co-founder of Google Deep Mind was quoted as saying that Google was going to \u201cturbo charge\u201d the Gemini app, saying that:\n\n\u201c\u2026the products themselves are going to evolve massively over the next year or two.\u201d\n\nThat means that the Gemini app is going to gain more functionalities in a bid to make it more ubiquitous as the interface between potential website visitors and Google Search, a significant departure from interfacing with the search box.\n\nThis is something that publishers and SEOs need to think really hard about as we enter 2025. Google is focusing on increasing user adoption of the Gemini app. If that happens then that will mean more people interfacing with that instead of the Google Search box.\n\nUniversal Assistant (Project Astra)\n\nAnother thing that the SEO industry seriously needs to consider is Google\u2019s universal assistant that\u2019s code-named Project Astra. The Deep Mind co-founder is reported to have discussed their Universal Assistant, which what Project Astra is referred as.\n\nHe\u2019s quoted as saying that it can:\n\n\u201c\u2026seamlessly operate over any domain, any modality or any device.\u201d\n\nWhat that word \u201cdomain\u201d means is that it can function across any subject, like answering questions about healthcare, directions, entertainment, over any topic. The part about modality is a reference to text, voice, images, and video.\n\nThis is a serious situation for SEO. Google\u2019s new Deep Research agentic search is an example of a disruptive technology that may have a negative impact on the web ecosystem.\n\nOne of the Google Deep Mind researchers cited as working on Project Astra is also listed as a co-inventor on a patent about controlling interactive AI agents through multi-modal inputs.\n\nThe patent is titled, Controlling Interactive Agents Using Multi-Modal Inputs. The description of the invention is:\n\n\u201cMethods, systems, and apparatus, including computer programs encoded on a computer storage medium, for controlling agents. In particular, an interactive agent can be controlled based on multi-modal inputs that include both an observation image and a natural language text sequence.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just one of dozens of researchers cited as having worked on Project Astra. Astra is another one of the projects that Google is working on that replaces the traditional search box as people\u2019s point of contact for interacting with web data.\n\nTakeaway About Google\u2019s Plans For 2025\n\nThe takeaway from all this is that publishers and SEOs need to take a break from focusing solely on the search box and give some time to considering what\u2019s going on in multimodal AI. In 2025, AI is not just AI Overviews. AI is Gemini, it\u2019s new features coming to Gemini and possibly the release of features developed from Project Astra, a multimodal universal agent. Agentic Search is already here in the form of Gemini Deep Research. All of these are a departure from the traditional search box as the point of contact between users, Google and websites.\n\nRead the report on CNBC\n\nGoogle CEO Pichai tells employees to gear up for big 2025: \u2018The stakes are high\u2019\n\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/Rokas Tenys"

            "article_content": "A woman vanishes into thin air with a man who does not exist, a dreary village visited by a police party disappears the next day, a burly man suspected of murdering his wife dies mysteriously, and the police officer who witnesses this all is transported 30 years back to his class of 1986 as he steps inside the old building of his alma mater.\n\n\n\nThese are some of the stories in retired IPS officer and ex-chief of the National Security Guard (NSG) M.A. Ganapathy\u2019s debut book Whispers in the Shadows: Paranormal Encounters of a Policeman. The book is unusual in more ways than one. Unlike most ex-cops who would write of tales of bravery, achievements, administrative ills, or insider info, Ganapathy detours towards a path less taken and fictionalises a policeman\u2019s life and gives it a paranormal twist, as if to make sense of many puzzling events he must have witnessed in his long and illustrious career.\n\nThis is an interesting choice given his writing about his work at the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Ministry of Home Affairs, Central Industrial Security Force, and as the DGP of Uttarakhand before hanging his boots as the chief of the NSG earlier this year, could have made for a juicy read.\n\nHowever, the ex-cop takes the Ruskin Bond route of paranormal tales, who also serves as an inspiration. \u201cRuskin Bond\u2019s stories in this genre became my staple at one point, which I read several times over,\u201d Ganapathy writes about the much-loved writer, who, in turn, reviews the book as \u201ccompelling, intriguing and genuine\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy interest in the paranormal was fuelled in no small measure by the stories of certain odd events narrated by my grandfather, a retired forester, who had served in remote corners of South India,\u201d the author writes in the introduction, and it shows. While every short story in this quick-to-read book spanning just over 100 pages is engrossing, the tales where he absolutely shines are those set against forests with spirits and wildlife appearing periodically to seek redemption for the victims through a paranormal route.\n\nThe stories are told through the eyes of Avinash, a diligent and low-profile cop. The first book of any writer is an autobiography of sorts, they say, and it\u2019s evident in Ganapathy\u2019s work as he takes the readers through India\u2019s varied landscapes where he grew up and worked, from his native home in the Western Ghats and alma mater in Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and the Naxal-hit regions of central India.\n\nUnlike how policemen are generally showcased in popular culture as either god-sent or pure evil, Ganapathy doesn\u2019t portray them as either but rather shines the light on the victims. And in the process, he also humanises his lot by focusing on what they experience on the field and their relationship with their work, colleagues, families, teachers, alma mater, and even the victims and the offenders. \u201cWhy do human beings inflict such unspeakable atrocities on other human beings, that too for an outdated ideology, he (Avinash) wondered,\u201d he writes, giving a peak into a policeman\u2019s psyche.\n\nWhispers in the Shadow isn\u2019t your typical horror read. In fact, it doesn\u2019t even use horror to spook the reader but to make sense of the difficult-to-comprehend events and offer closure where none exists. From spooky forest spirits to post-death experiences and time travel, Ganapathy employs just enough elements to make his debut book an interesting and captivating read.\n\nWhispers in the Shadows: Paranormal Encounters of a Policeman\n\nAuthor: M.A. Ganapathy\n\nPublisher: Srishti Publishers and Distributors\n\nPages: 120\n\nPrice: Rs 299"

            "article_content": "In September, 2011, I drove to Plains, Georgia, with Gerald Rafshoon, President Jimmy Carter\u2019s former media adviser. Rafshoon had asked me to write a play about the 1978 Camp David summit between Carter, President Anwar Sadat, of Egypt, and Menachem Begin, the Israeli Prime Minister. They were three pious men. Sadat called himself \u201cthe first man of Islam.\u201d He plotted against the British and was charged with complicity in an assassination of a pro-British minister, and had come to the Presidency only through the death of the charismatic leader of the Arab world, Gamal Abdel Nasser. Begin was an Orthodox Jew\u2014the first non-secular leader of Israel and the founder of the Likud Party\u2014and had lost his parents in the Holocaust. He had also been the head of a terrorist organization, the Irgun, and was responsible for the deaths of more than ninety people in the bombing of the King David Hotel, in Jerusalem, in 1946. Carter, an evangelical Christian, had had little prior political experience other than a single term as the governor of Georgia. These men spent thirteen days secluded near Maryland\u2019s Catoctin Mountain and produced a peace treaty that has endured for forty years. It was Jimmy Carter\u2019s signature accomplishment and one that has never been matched in the region, despite decades of strenuous attempts.\n\nThe Carters lived in a ranch house on the edge of town. We met in the front room, where Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, sat on a couch upholstered in a blue print that matched the curtains. Behind them was a painting that Carter had made of the same room, with its grandfather clock, rocking chairs, and roll-top desk. It looked like an illustration from the children\u2019s book \u201cGoodnight Moon.\u201d Not depicted were two matching elliptical machines that faced the television. Carter was eighty-six at the time. He wore khaki pants, short athletic socks, and a blue shirt that almost disappeared against the couch. His silver belt buckle was a horseshoe enclosing the initials J.C. He had not shaved, and his white stubble made his face more wintry than usual. I was just beginning my research, and I didn\u2019t yet know who the characters in the play should be, beyond Carter, Sadat, and Begin.\n\nRafshoon introduced me by saying that I had recently published an article in The New Yorker about Scientology. \u201cOh, I read that,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI found it most intriguing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when did you start reading The New Yorker?\u201d Rosalynn asked.\n\n\u201cI read it every week!\u201d he protested.\n\nRosalynn rolled her eyes. It was as if she had leapt onstage. Dramatically, I needed someone who could talk to Carter with the unvarnished candor and the unsparing insight that comes from a lifetime spent together. Rosalynn was born in Plains, and her family lived next door to the house where the Carter family then lived, though she and Jimmy didn\u2019t become romantically involved until 1945, when he came home for the summer from the United States Naval Academy, in Annapolis. After their first date, he told his mother that he was going to marry Rosalynn. They were wed the following year, after his graduation. He was twenty-one and she was eighteen.\n\nCarter owned a stand of pines, which were being harvested, so we rode out in a Secret Service Tahoe to watch the trees being cut, trimmed, and loaded onto a flatbed truck. The agent driving the car was new and unfamiliar with the back roads. Carter was testy and snapped at him when he missed a turn. I felt sympathy for the agent, who had signed up to protect his country and found himself driving down on a dirt road, answering to an impatient old man who had once been the most powerful figure in the world and had since become the closest approximation in public life to an American saint. Along the way, Carter gave us a drive-by tour of his childhood home, which is now a historic site, the Jimmy Carter Boyhood Farm, in the small community of Archery, three miles west of Plains, where his family moved when he was four. \u201cThis is where I learned blacksmithing. This is the barn where I used to corral mules,\u201d he said, not bothering to get out of the car. There was a dirt tennis court that his father had built. \u201cI could beat every kid in town, but I never beat my father,\u201d Carter told us.\n\nThe Carters were the only white family in Archery, and his playmates were the children of Black tenant farmers. The lessons he drew from his background in southern Georgia would define his political career. He lost his first run for governor, in 1966, to Lester Maddox, one of the most racist figures in modern Georgia history. That defeat sent him into a spiritual crisis, and he later credited his experience of being \u201cborn again\u201d for getting him through this bleak period. In his gubernatorial inaugural address, in 1971, Carter said, \u201cI say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over.\u201d In the South at that time, the declaration was a landmark, and it got him on the cover of Time magazine.\n\nCarter made a point of showing me the family cemetery\u2014a dirt patch surrounded by a hurricane fence. His people had been in the area since the early nineteenth century, and the tombstones were worn and covered in lichen. He was clearly proud of how tidy the ground was, having cleared it himself, nearly stepping on a rattlesnake in the process.\n\nWe passed a deserted farmhouse that Carter said was haunted. \u201cBy what?\u201d I asked. \u201cHaints,\u201d Carter said, using an old Southern term for ghosts. He said that, as a boy, when he was working in town or staying late at school after dark, he was terrified of walking past the house. Several times, he thought he saw a haint in the window, \u201ca woman with a lamp.\u201d There was a legend that a woman who once lived there kept her daughter in the attic, he told me. \u201cMaybe that was her.\u201d\n\nWhen we got back to the house, the Carters decided that we should all go into town for dinner\u2014i.e., lunch\u2014at Mom\u2019s Kitchen. The Carters rode in the Tahoe, and Rafshoon and I drove with Mary Prince, an African American woman who had worked for the Carters for decades. Prince had been convicted of murder following the shooting of a man outside a bar in Lumpkin, Georgia, in 1970. When the Carters lived in the Governor\u2019s Mansion, she was assigned there as a trusty prisoner, and worked as a nanny to their daughter, Amy. During Carter\u2019s Presidency, he arranged to be designated as Prince\u2019s parole officer, so that she could work in the White House. She was eventually declared innocent of the murder and was granted a full pardon.\n\nMom\u2019s turned out to be an all-you-can-eat buffet serving fried chicken, meat loaf, and collard greens. We talked a bit about politics and the 2012 election. Carter had his differences with President Barack Obama but thought that he would be re\u00eblected. Rick Perry, then the governor of Texas, had just jumped into the race as an early favorite. Carter thought he had no chance of winning, but, if he did, \u201cit may be a disaster for the Republican Party.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d Rosalynn observed, \u201cwe thought the same about Reagan.\u201d\n\nI was still intrigued by Carter\u2019s paranormal experiences, so I asked him about a time in the nineteen-sixties when he said he saw a U.F.O. He was the head of several Lions Clubs in Georgia, and had gone to make a speech at a club in another town. \u201cThere were about twenty-five other men standing outside,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThere was a light over the trees, at first no bigger than a star, then like a moon, then it hovered over the trees. It was big and round. Then it moved away.\u201d\n\nI said that I had once seen something similar, while driving through Alabama. An astronomer friend had said it was a \u201cnoctilucent cloud,\u201d a mysterious phenomenon which, at the time, was common enough to have acquired a name but still defied understanding. It was shaped like a perfect globe and appeared solid, like a hovering moon, until it slowly dissolved.\n\n\u201cSomething else strange did happen, while I was President,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe had a plane go down in Zaire with some important documents. We searched for it. We adjusted our satellites to comb through the area, without success. Finally, my director of intelligence, Stansfield Turner, said he knew of a psychic in California. Apparently, he spoke to her, and she wrote down some co\u00f6rdinates. And we programmed that into the satellite, and, the next time it passed over, there was the plane.\u201d \u201cThat tells me a lot about the intelligence community,\u201d I said. \u201cIndeed,\u201d Carter said. \u201cOne of our few successes.\u201d\n\nIn 1973, when Carter was still governor, he and Rosalynn journeyed to Israel. It was both a spiritual and a political pilgrimage. Golda Meir was the Prime Minister, and, as a courtesy, she accorded the Georgia governor and his wife an old Mercedes and a driver to ferry them around the Holy Land. The trip to Israel fortified Carter\u2019s international portfolio and awarded him credibility among American Jews, a critical Democratic constituency for the improbable race that he was considering. The Carters also visited several Jewish settlements on the West Bank, which he concluded posed a significant obstacle to peace. He was profoundly moved by Israel\u2019s struggle, and on his first day in the Oval Office, in January, 1977, he stunned his Vice-President, Walter Mondale, by saying that his first priority was to bring peace to the Middle East. Carter later told me that he believed God had put him into the Presidency for that very reason."

            "article_content": "Dandadan, Dandadan, Dandadan, Dandadan, Dandadan. Even before it got its anime adaptation, the title of one of this year\u2019s best shows feels like it was destined to be turned into rhythm. Thank god the Japanese band behind the anime\u2019s catchy and propulsive opening had the same idea, one that\u2019s compelled over 32 million views and counting on YouTube alone (and that\u2019s just one of its listings \u2013 there\u2019s another on Netflix\u2019s channel). The bouncy, fast-paced backing track already feels perfectly representative of this animated take on the manga by Yukinobu Tatsu, in a goofy, chaotic and idiosyncratic genre mash-up.\n\nThe show itself, directed by F\u016bga Yamashiro with animation produced by Science Saru, is similarly flexible. A marriage of science fiction and horror, reflections on contemporary urban living and age-old folklore, high school romance and hard-hitting action, there\u2019s a little bit of something for everybody. \"Dandadan\" is the story of Momo Ayase and Ken \u201cOkarun\u201d Takakura, two seemingly opposite classmates at school who are drawn together by a mutual fascination with the paranormal. Momo insists that ghosts and spirits are real, while Ken (whom Momo later nicknames Okarun) believes in aliens.\n\nNeither believe the other at first, before each land themselves into an encounter with those very things. Momo is abducted by aliens, Okarun is possessed by Turbo Granny, a spirit haunting a tunnel (and yes, Turbo Granny is the actual name of a spirit from Japanese urban legend). Both survive the experience, but gain strange new powers as a result, and use those to solve various hauntings and other abductions throughout this 12-episode run (with more to come next year). Not only that, but the two have to begin a search: during his possession by Turbo Granny, Okarun\u2019s balls got stolen.\n\nTurbo Granny in \"Dandadan\" (Yukinobu Tatsu/Shueisha, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\nAs well as the general mayhem that emerges it\u2019s fun seeing how each episode of \"Dandadan\" highlights its different building blocks: One episode might be more ghostly, the next leaning more into sci-fi, with some surprisingly long stretches dedicated to fleshing out the budding romance between Momo and Okarun. In action-oriented anime, romance is usually an afterthought, but in \"Dandadan\" it's one of the driving forces of the story \u2013 including arcs about communication and anxiety that are surprisingly sincere and generous about these feelings, while giving a lot of space for characters to figure out some tangled emotions.\n\nRelated The 12 biggest moments in animation in 2023\n\nIt\u2019s the balancing act to the rest of the show\u2019s sometimes willfully juvenile humor, which actually never tips into insufferable, just silly (though this is perhaps underselling how deranged the first couple of episodes are). The show has been a standout this year in part because of its sense of unpredictability as well as its sincere investment in its romance, and its eye-catching visual approach, which is perhaps not as experimental as the studio\u2019s other work has been (though one standout episode has an astonishing first person conceit), but it\u2019s consistently beautiful.\n\nThose \"Dandadan\" main titles\n\nDirected by Abel Gongora of \"Scott Pilgrim Takes Off\" fame, the viral opening credits encompass all of these sides to the show. The backing song \u2013 performed by a band called Creepy Nuts, oddly appropriate for this \u2013 first kicks things off with wild and energetic rapping before settling into a gentler, poppy hook, almost reflective of the tonal swings in the show that follows. It\u2019s also just an earworm, perhaps even surpassing Gongora\u2019s last efforts as director on the opening for Science Saru\u2019s \"Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!!\" which also went viral in its day.\n\nAll this and having style to spare, it\u2019s also just fun.\n\nThe animation itself complements these change-ups beautifully \u2013 shifting art styles as it moves from the quickfire montage of detailed, goofy expressions hinting at the main cast\u2019s personalities to the more heavily stylized touches, as the camera zooms out until the person in frame becomes a shape amidst a block color background. Interspersed throughout are some paintings of the various spirits and aliens, silhouetted against the block colors which within the show itself become strongly associated with them: each spiritual or alien encounter leading to the following scenes being taken over by that single block color. It\u2019s not just a hint at the show\u2019s own style, but a reference to its influences; many have noted that much of the opening refers back to that of the original \"Ultraman,\" the monsters from which have inspired a lot of those in \"Dandadan.\" This wild minute-and-a-half eventually settles into a hint at something more tender as the two main characters lean on each other and look at the stars.\n\nMomo in \"Dandadan\" (Yukinobu Tatsu/Shueisha, DANDADAN Production Committee)\n\nAll this and having style to spare, it\u2019s also just fun. There\u2019s giant crabs, guys running so fast they turn into a mess of jagged lines, there\u2019s a maneki-neko doll running around, there\u2019s dancing (modeled on moves from a Rihanna video, as pointed out by some eagle-eyed fans).\n\nIt speaks to something which has felt missing from a lot of television in recent years, as so many opening sequences have gotten tied up in feeling prestigious, leading down the same road of moody and atmospheric music over a montage of animated statues. Even the animated smash hit \"Arcane,\" which is more eclectic than even \"Dandadan\" in its visual approach, fell into this same trap as it relented to these prestige TV trends.\n\n\"Dandadan\u2019s\" opening, for all the influences it proudly presents, doesn\u2019t feel so anonymous. It has personality and energy, no anxiety about not being taken seriously. Admittedly, though on average they trend to being more, well, animated than a lot of TV main titles, anime opening and ending credits tend to follow their own medium's tropes. Think images of hands reaching out the sun, the protagonist running . . . somewhere, the cast falling out of the sky. You can get generic versions of these too; there\u2019s no ironclad rule, and Gongora\u2019s work on \"Dandadan\" (and \"Eizouken\") feel idiosyncratic within that space too.\n\nWhy not have an opening that encourages you to sing the title?\n\nStill, they\u2019re at the pinnacle of a format which can sometimes feel like an afterthought, as television gets absorbed more and more into an age of \u201cSkip Intro\u201d buttons and streamers attempting to push you through to the next episode as soon as possible. It should be said that there are notable recent exceptions: think \"Peacemaker,\" \"Pachinko\" (I promise, I\u2019m not just naming intros with dance routines), \"Severance\" or \"Succession\" (there you go). These are shows with different priorities, yes, and anime like \"Dandadan\" is looking toward pop sensibilities rather than HBO\u2019s \u201cit\u2019s not TV\u201d mindset, something many treat as aspirational. But openings like this (and like \"Peacemaker\") are part of the fun, a chance to capture the show in microcosm, and chasing trends feels like it diminishes that chance.\n\nPerhaps this is all part of my wider problem with streaming, the expectation to get everything at once, ravenously consume it, and click to the next thing, rather than have fun with the ritual of television, of seeing something on a weekly basis and growing familiar with it. I can\u2019t get \"Dandadan\" out of my head, so I\u2019ll be coming back. Why not have an opening that encourages you to sing the title?"

By using AI\u2019s unparalleled ability to process and analyze complex datasets, researchers are now equipped to address some of the most intricate challenges in science. From breakthroughs in protein folding to advancements in quantum computing, the implications of this shift are expected to accelerate innovation at a pace previously unimaginable. The integration of AI into these domains signals a new era of discovery and progress.\n\nBut what exactly is digital biology, and how can AI transform fields as complex as biology and drug development? Think of it as a innovative way of viewing life itself\u2014as an information system that can be analyzed, predicted, and even simulated. With tools like AlphaFold already making waves by solving the decades-old puzzle of protein folding, the possibilities seem endless.\n\nWhat Is Digital Biology?\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Digital biology, powered by AI, is transforming biology and drug discovery by decoding complex biological systems, exemplified by breakthroughs like DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold in protein folding.\n\nAI accelerates scientific discovery by reducing research timelines, simulating biological systems, and solving long-standing challenges in areas like cellular mechanisms and drug development.\n\nAI is most effective in problems with massive search spaces, clear objectives, and large datasets, with synthetic data generation expanding its applicability in data-scarce scenarios.\n\nClassical and quantum computing serve as complementary tools, with quantum systems addressing extreme computational demands while classical computing remains vital for many efficient algorithms.\n\nAI\u2019s integration into science is driving fantastic advancements across disciplines, including materials science, physics, and engineering, promising new discoveries in the coming decades.\n\nDigital biology envisions biological systems as information-processing frameworks, where AI serves as a powerful \u201cdescription language\u201d to decode life\u2019s complexities. A prime example of this is DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold, an AI system that has significantly advanced protein folding research. For decades, scientists grappled with the challenge of predicting protein structures, a critical task for understanding biological processes and developing treatments. AlphaFold solved this long-standing problem with unprecedented accuracy, offering insights that are already transforming drug discovery and disease research.\n\nThis achievement underscores how AI can enhance our understanding of life at the molecular level. By treating biological systems as data-rich environments, digital biology enables researchers to uncover patterns and mechanisms that were previously hidden. The success of AlphaFold demonstrates the potential of AI to bridge knowledge gaps and accelerate progress in fields that rely on molecular and cellular insights.\n\nAI\u2019s Expanding Role in Scientific Discovery\n\nAI\u2019s applications in science extend far beyond protein folding, offering fantastic benefits across multiple disciplines. In drug development, for instance, AI can drastically reduce the time required to identify promising drug candidates. What once took years can now be accomplished in months or even weeks. By simulating biological systems, AI allows researchers to predict experimental outcomes with remarkable precision, minimizing the need for costly and time-consuming laboratory trials.\n\nBeyond drug discovery, AI is addressing complex challenges in biology, such as modeling cellular mechanisms, simulating entire organisms, and analyzing genetic interactions. These capabilities are reshaping how science is conducted, allowing researchers to explore questions that were previously considered too complex or resource-intensive. AI\u2019s ability to process vast amounts of data and identify meaningful patterns is unlocking new opportunities for innovation in areas such as genomics, neuroscience, and environmental science.\n\nGoogle Deepmind CEO\u2019s Prediction \u2013 Digital Biology\n\nUncover more insights about Artificial Intelligence (AI) in previous articles we have written.\n\nWhen Is AI the Right Tool?\n\nAI is not a universal solution for all scientific problems, but it excels in specific scenarios where its strengths can be fully used. The most promising applications of AI in science share three defining characteristics:\n\nMassive combinatorial search spaces that require evaluating countless possibilities\n\nClearly defined objective functions that guide the AI toward optimal solutions\n\nAccess to large datasets, which provide the foundation for training and refining AI models\n\nIn cases where real-world data is limited, researchers can generate synthetic datasets to train AI systems. This approach enables scientists to simulate scenarios that would otherwise remain inaccessible, further expanding the scope of AI\u2019s utility. By combining real and synthetic data, researchers can tackle problems that demand high levels of precision and adaptability.\n\nClassical vs. Quantum Computing: Complementary Tools\n\nWhile classical computing has been instrumental in advancing scientific research, it faces limitations when dealing with extreme computational demands. Quantum computing offers a complementary solution, using its unique ability to process information in fundamentally different ways. For example, Google\u2019s advancements in quantum systems, such as reducing error rates, highlight the potential of this technology to solve problems that are beyond the reach of classical methods.\n\nHowever, classical computing remains indispensable for many applications, particularly those where existing algorithms efficiently model natural phenomena. Together, classical and quantum computing form a synergistic partnership, providing researchers with a diverse set of tools to address a wide range of scientific challenges. By integrating these technologies, scientists can push the boundaries of what is computationally possible, opening new avenues for discovery.\n\nBroader Implications for Science\n\nThe integration of AI into scientific research is set to redefine numerous disciplines, extending far beyond biology. In materials science, AI can accelerate the discovery of new materials with desirable properties, such as superconductors or lightweight alloys. In physics, AI-driven models are helping researchers unravel the mysteries of the universe, from dark matter to the behavior of subatomic particles. In engineering, AI is optimizing designs for greater efficiency, sustainability, and performance.\n\nAI\u2019s influence also extends to fields like complexity theory and information theory, where it is allowing researchers to analyze and model intricate systems with unprecedented accuracy. The rapid pace of AI innovation suggests that the coming decades will bring breakthroughs across a wide range of scientific domains. By automating routine tasks and enhancing analytical capabilities, AI is empowering scientists to focus on creative problem-solving and hypothesis generation.\n\nLooking Ahead: A New Frontier\n\nThe prediction of a digital biology revolution underscores the fantastic potential of AI in reshaping science and technology. From solving protein folding with AlphaFold to accelerating drug discovery and exploring the possibilities of quantum computing, AI is unlocking new frontiers of innovation. As researchers continue to harness AI\u2019s capabilities, the boundaries of what is scientifically achievable will expand, paving the way for discoveries that were once considered unattainable.\n\nThis era of digital biology and AI-driven science represents a paradigm shift in how humanity understands and interacts with the natural world. By integrating AI into the fabric of scientific inquiry, researchers are not only solving existing problems but also uncovering entirely new questions to explore. The future of science lies at the intersection of human ingenuity and machine intelligence, promising a wealth of opportunities for discovery and progress.\n\nMedia Credit: Matthew Berman\n\n\n\nLatest Geeky Gadgets Deals\n\nSome of our articles include affiliate links.

            "article_content": "There are a lot of things in the world that we don't quite understand. And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

            "article_content": "A new artificial intelligence (AI) model has just achieved human-level results on a test designed to measure \u201cgeneral intelligence\u201d.\n\nOn December 20, OpenAI\u2019s o3 system scored 85% on the ARC-AGI benchmark, well above the previous AI best score of 55% and on par with the average human score. It also scored well on a very difficult mathematics test.\n\nCreating artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is the stated goal of all the major AI research labs. At first glance, OpenAI appears to have at least made a significant step towards this goal.\n\nWhile scepticism remains, many AI researchers and developers feel something just changed. For many, the prospect of AGI now seems more real, urgent and closer than anticipated. Are they right?\n\nGeneralisation and intelligence\n\nTo understand what the o3 result means, you need to understand what the ARC-AGI test is all about. In technical terms, it\u2019s a test of an AI system\u2019s \u201csample efficiency\u201d in adapting to something new \u2013 how many examples of a novel situation the system needs to see to figure out how it works.\n\nAn AI system like ChatGPT (GPT-4) is not very sample efficient. It was \u201ctrained\u201d on millions of examples of human text, constructing probabilistic \u201crules\u201d about which combinations of words are most likely.\n\nThe result is pretty good at common tasks. It is bad at uncommon tasks, because it has less data (fewer samples) about those tasks.\n\nUntil AI systems can learn from small numbers of examples and adapt with more sample efficiency, they will only be used for very repetitive jobs and ones where the occasional failure is tolerable.\n\nThe ability to accurately solve previously unknown or novel problems from limited samples of data is known as the capacity to generalise. It is widely considered a necessary, even fundamental, element of intelligence.\n\nGrids and patterns\n\nThe ARC-AGI benchmark tests for sample efficient adaptation using little grid square problems like the one below. The AI needs to figure out the pattern that turns the grid on the left into the grid on the right.\n\nEach question gives three examples to learn from. The AI system then needs to figure out the rules that \u201cgeneralise\u201d from the three examples to the fourth.\n\nThese are a lot like the IQ tests sometimes you might remember from school.\n\nWeak rules and adaptation\n\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how OpenAI has done it, but the results suggest the o3 model is highly adaptable. From just a few examples, it finds rules that can be generalised.\n\nTo figure out a pattern, we shouldn\u2019t make any unnecessary assumptions, or be more specific than we really have to be. In theory, if you can identify the \u201cweakest\u201d rules that do what you want, then you have maximised your ability to adapt to new situations.\n\nWhat do we mean by the weakest rules? The technical definition is complicated, but weaker rules are usually ones that can be described in simpler statements.\n\nIn the example above, a plain English expression of the rule might be something like: \u201cAny shape with a protruding line will move to the end of that line and \u2018cover up\u2019 any other shapes it overlaps with.\u201d\n\nSearching chains of thought?\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know how OpenAI achieved this result just yet, it seems unlikely they deliberately optimised the o3 system to find weak rules. However, to succeed at the ARC-AGI tasks it must be finding them.\n\nWe do know that OpenAI started with a general-purpose version of the o3 model (which differs from most other models, because it can spend more time \u201cthinking\u201d about difficult questions) and then trained it specifically for the ARC-AGI test.\n\nFrench AI researcher Francois Chollet, who designed the benchmark, believes o3 searches through different \u201cchains of thought\u201d describing steps to solve the task. It would then choose the \u201cbest\u201d according to some loosely defined rule, or \u201cheuristic\u201d.\n\nThis would be \u201cnot dissimilar\u201d to how Google\u2019s AlphaGo system searched through different possible sequences of moves to beat the world Go champion.\n\nYou can think of these chains of thought like programs that fit the examples. Of course, if it is like the Go-playing AI, then it needs a heuristic, or loose rule, to decide which program is best.\n\nThere could be thousands of different seemingly equally valid programs generated. That heuristic could be \u201cchoose the weakest\u201d or \u201cchoose the simplest\u201d.\n\nHowever, if it is like AlphaGo then they simply had an AI create a heuristic. This was the process for AlphaGo. Google trained a model to rate different sequences of moves as better or worse than others.\n\nWhat we still don\u2019t know\n\nThe question then is, is this really closer to AGI? If that is how o3 works, then the underlying model might not be much better than previous models.\n\nThe concepts the model learns from language might not be any more suitable for generalisation than before. Instead, we may just be seeing a more generalisable \u201cchain of thought\u201d found through the extra steps of training a heuristic specialised to this test. The proof, as always, will be in the pudding.\n\nAlmost everything about o3 remains unknown. OpenAI has limited disclosure to a few media presentations and early testing to a handful of researchers, laboratories and AI safety institutions.\n\nTruly understanding the potential of o3 will require extensive work, including evaluations, an understanding of the distribution of its capacities, how often it fails and how often it succeeds.\n\nWhen o3 is finally released, we\u2019ll have a much better idea of whether it is approximately as adaptable as an average human.\n\nIf so, it could have a huge, revolutionary, economic impact, ushering in a new era of self-improving accelerated intelligence. We will require new benchmarks for AGI itself and serious consideration of how it ought to be governed.\n\nIf not, then this will still be an impressive result. However, everyday life will remain much the same.\n\nMichael Timothy Bennett, PhD Student, School of Computing, Australian National University and Elija Perrier, Research Fellow, Stanford Center for Responsible Quantum Technology, Stanford University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

X - @suchirbalaji / AP\n\nThe death of OpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji has become a subject of debate.\n\nBalaji, 26, a former OpenAI employee, was found dead in November.\n\nWhile authorities have said that Balaji\u2019s death \u201cappeared to be a suicide,\u201d his parents are insisting that there are signs of foul play and have demanded an FBI investigation.\n\nBut what do we know about Balaji\u2019s death? And what are his parents alleging?\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look:\n\nWhat happened?\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a brief look at Balaji.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBalaji grew up in San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area.\n\nAs per The Guardian, Balaji studied computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIt was at this time that he did an internship at Open AI \u2013 then a fledgling AI research lab.\n\nHe began working at OpenAI in November 2020.\n\nBalaji is said to have helped train the artificial intelligence systems behind\n\nAs per The Guardian, John Schulman, one of the founders of OpenAI, said Balaji worked on WebGPT \u2013 a precursor to ChatGPT.\n\nBalaji later shifted to organising the huge datasets of online writings and other media used to train GPT-4 \u2013 the fourth generation of OpenAI\u2019s flagship large language model and a basis for the company\u2019s famous chatbot.\n\nIt was that work that eventually caused Balaji to question the technology he helped build, especially after newspapers, novelists and\n\nothers began suing OpenAI and other AI companies for copyright infringement.\n\nBalaji ended up quitting the San Francisco firm in August.\n\nAccording to The Times of India, Balaji then accused the firm of violating copyright law in its training of ChatGPT.\n\nJohn Schulman, one of the founders of OpenAI, said Suchir Balaji worked on WebGPT \u2013 a precursor to ChatGPT. Reuters\n\nBalaji in October told The New York Times that the company had violated copyright law.\n\nHe claimed programmes like ChatGPT were damaging the internet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,\u201d Balaji told the newspaper.\n\nBalaji later told The Associated Press he would \u201ctry to testify\u201d in the strongest copyright infringement cases and considered a lawsuit brought by The New York Times last year to be the \u201cmost serious.\u201d\n\n_Times l_awyers named him in a November 18 court filing as someone who might have \u201cunique and relevant documents\u201d supporting allegations of OpenAI\u2019s willful copyright infringement.\n\nHis records were also sought by lawyers in a separate case brought by book authors including the comedian Sarah Silverman, according to a court filing.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right to be training on people\u2019s data and then competing with them in the marketplace,\u201d Balaji told the AP in late October. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be able to do that. I don\u2019t think you are able to do that legally.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe told the AP that he gradually grew more disillusioned with OpenAI, especially after the internal turmoil that led its board of directors to fire and then rehire CEO Sam Altman last year. Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations.\n\nBut of the \u201cbag of issues\u201d he was concerned about, he said he was focusing on copyright as the one it was \u201cactually possible to do something about.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that it was an unpopular opinion within the AI research community, which is accustomed to pulling data from the internet, but said \u201cthey will have to change and it\u2019s a matter of time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFound dead\n\nBalaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26 by the police.\n\nAs per The Guardian, his mother Poornima Ramarao, who lives in California\u2019s Union City, had filed a missing persons complaint with the police.\n\nThis, after she was unable to get in touch with her son for a few days.\n\nPolice in Union City then reached out to authorities in San Francisco \u2013 who found Balaji dead.\n\n\u201cOfficers and medics arrived on scene and located a deceased adult male from what appeared to be a suicide,\u201d police said. \u201cNo evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation.\u201d\n\nOpenAI after Balaji\u2019s death released a statement saying, \u201cWe are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news and our hearts go out to Suchir\u2019s loved ones during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchulman, who incidentally quit on the same day as Balaji, was quoted as saying by The Guardian, \u201cI was heartbroken to hear of Suchir\u2019s passing. I worked with Suchir on and off since around 2021, and he was one of my favorite and most talented collaborators.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuchir\u2019s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn\u2019t have succeeded without him,\u201d Schulman, who recruited Balaji to his team, said.\n\nHe wrote that what made him such an exceptional engineer and scientist was his attention to detail and ability to notice subtle bugs or logical errors.\n\n\u201cHe had a knack for finding simple solutions and writing elegant code that worked,\u201d Schulman wrote. \u201cHe\u2019d think through the details of things carefully and rigorously.\u201d\n\nBut Balaji\u2019s family said he showed no signs of wanting to take his own life.\n\nThey also pointed out that Balaji had no history of mental illness.\n\nThey added that no suicide note was recovered.\n\nBalaji Ramamurthy, who was the last person to talk to his son on 22 November, said they discussed his trip to Los Angeles as part of his birthday celebration.\n\n\u201cHe was in LA and having a good time. So he sent us all the pictures,\u201d Ramamurthy said. \u201cHe was in a good mood.\u201d\n\nBalaji\u2019s family described him as a \u201chappy, smart and brave young man\u201d who loved to hike.\n\n\u201cI was the last person to talk to him,\u201d Ramamurthy told The Times of India. \u201cHe was happy, not depressed or anything. It was his birthday week. How can anyone believe there was no note left?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe made plans to see us in January. That was the last phone conversation he had with anyone. He went into his apartment and never came out,\u201d Ramarao claimed as per Hindustan Times.\n\n\u2018Foul play involved\u2019\n\nBalaji\u2019s family has insisted that foul play is involved.\n\nHis mother Ramarao claimed it took the medical examiner under a minute to call the incident a suicide.\n\n\u201cThe reason they said is he went inside and did not come out, nobody was with him \u2026 and he shot himself,\u201d she was quoted as saying by The Guardian. \u201cThere was a gun near him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were signs of a fight in the bathroom. Blood shots. This cannot be ignored,\u201d she was quoted as saying by The Times of India.\n\nHis parents have demanded that the FBI investigate Balaji\u2019s case.\n\nRamarao on X wrote that they hired a private investigator and even carried out a second autopsy.\n\nShe said the autopsy did not confirm cause of death as stated by police.\n\nShe claimed her son\u2019s apartment was ransacked, there were signs of struggle in the bathroom and that based on blood spots, it looked like someone had hit him.\n\nShe claimed that the authorities had declared as suicide what is a cold blooded murder.\n\n\u201cLobbying in SF city doesn\u2019t stop us from getting justices. We demand FBi investigation,\u201d she concluded.\n\nThe family has also started a GoFundMe to raise funds for litigation and to conduct a detailed investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk, has thrown his two cents in too.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like a suicide,\u201d the world\u2019s richest man wrote on his social media platform X.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk was an early investor in OpenAI. Source: Reuters.\n\nMusk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company earlier this year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.\n\nMusk and OpenAI founder Sam Altman were said to be at odds over whom would run the firm.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of users on social media also rallied behind Balaji\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cThis is a high profile case that needs to be thoroughly investigated,\u201d one user wrote.\n\n\u201cIs America really struggling to handle basic investigations? This is so concerning. He was a whistleblower, clearly at risk, and calling this a su**cide just doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d another added.\n\nBalaji had not been deposed.\n\nIt remains unclear to what extent his revelations will be admitted as evidence in any legal cases after his death.\n\nHe also published a personal blog post with his opinions about the topic.\n\nWith inputs from agencies"

            "article_content": "Based on conversations with industry insiders, Business Insider rounded up the hedge funds to watch in 2025.\n\nFirms include Walleye Capital, Lone Pine, Renaissance Technologies, and an OpenAI-connected launch.\n\n2024 was a strong year for the industry, though pressure is building on the industry's middle class.\n\nWith trillions of dollars in assets and dozens of billionaires, the hedge fund industry is doing fine, even if there's been a renewed push from the industry's biggest backers to rein in costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFunds performed well in 2024, returning more than 10% through November, according to industry tracker PivotalPath \u2014 even though the average firm won't match the returns of the S&P 500, which is on track to finish above 20% for the second year in a row. Managers handled the volatility around the reelection of former president Donald Trump well, and top managers can still command eye-popping fees and yearslong lock-up periods.\n\nBut, like any sector, the industry is increasingly splitting between the haves and the have-nots. Based on conversations with a dozen industry insiders \u2014 from LPs to prime brokers to fund executives themselves \u2014 Business Insider compiled a list of 10 hedge funds to watch in the coming year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's a mix of longtime giants, new launches, struggling managers, and overseas specialists.\n\n1. Walleye Capital\n\nWalleye is run by Will England. Walleye Capital\n\n$7.4 billion Walleye \u2014 a firm that is hoping to be the best midsize multistrategy fund in the industry \u2014 spent 2024 reconfiguring.\n\nComing into the firm were big names from bigger firms: former Citadel executives and investors like Matt Giannini and Rory Murphy, one-time ExodusPoint marketer Anil Jethanandani, former Balyasny PM Anil Gondi, WorldQuant's options head Rupert Graham, and more. Meanwhile, leaders like Raj Sethi, who topped the manager's macro and fixed-income team, and Anuraj Dua, who had led some systematic macro efforts at the firm, departed the manager.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe firm's ambitions have grown. The manager, which started in Minnesota as an options market maker, now has offices across the US as well as in London and Dubai. And it has former Citadel executive Tom DeAngelis as president.\n\nWith strong performance in 2024 \u2014 Walleye was up 15.4% through November \u2014 the firm is set to continue to make headlines in 2025.\n\n2. Pinpoint Asset Management\n\nPeople walk along a busy street in the Pudong financial district in Shanghai. Reuters/Carlos Barria\n\nAsia's hedge fund scene has been booming, with new launches in Singapore and Hong Kong from former Millennium executives as well as expansions from regional players like Dymon Asia. But while many players in the region focus on markets like Japan or South Korea \u2014 or look westward to the Middle East \u2014 Pinpoint boasts its China focus proudly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe manager, which has headquarters in Hong Kong but offices in Shanghai, is set to have its best year in its $1.2 billion multistrategy fund since 2020, with an 8.6% gain through November. Yet it is the firm's China fund, which is soft closed, that has been the story of the year, with a 17.3% gain through November, according to HSBC's Hedge Weekly report. As Trump woos China's leader, Xi Jinping, Pinpoint hopes its expertise in the country will set it apart in 2025.\n\n3. Viking Global Investors\n\nViking's billionaire cofounder Andreas Halvorsen is the CEO of the asset manager. Photo: Matthew Staver/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAnother year, another CIO departure. Since 2015, Viking Global, the $48 billion stockpicker run by cofounder Andreas Halvorsen, has had four CIOs or co-CIOs depart the firm, including Ning Jin, who left the firm in August.\n\nViking, however, has proven its ability to train the next generation of investment talent internally and keep the trains on schedule when a senior leader departs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Jin follows the path of many former Viking investing heads in setting up a new fund, the firm \u2014 up 12.2% through November \u2014 has tapped portfolio manager Justin Walsh to be its latest CIO.\n\nAccording to a presentation he gave to Harvard Business School students this year, one of his biggest worries is a possible multistrategy meltdown.\n\nRelated stories\n\n4. Eisler Capital\n\nEisler has offices in the US, Europe, and Middle East. Eisler Capital\n\nEd Eisler's eponymous firm has struggled to keep up with the multistrategy pack. With most firms in the firm's peer group expected to return around 10% or more this year, $4 billion Eisler will likely end 2024 with returns below 5%. The manager had returned a little over 2% on the year through November, a person close to the manager said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's not for a lack of trying, of course \u2014 another person familiar with the firm told BI that Eisler forced portfolio managers to be fully deployed earlier, meaning all of the capital they managed had to be invested in something, even if they didn't necessarily see a good opportunity.\n\nOne tough year doesn't doom a manager, and turnaround stories like Schonfeld prove that any fund is just a strong stretch of performance away from being back on top. Whether Eisler can rise to the occasion in 2025 remains to be seen.\n\n5. Marshall Wace Asset Management\n\nBillionaire Paul Marshall is one of the two cofounders of Marshall Wace. Photo by: Heidi Gutman/CNBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images\n\nOne of London's blue-chip managers, $70 billion Marshall Wace spent 2024 institutionalizing even further. The firm is fully invested in the war for talent, despite its billionaire cofounder speaking out against the trend \u2014 the manager has spent recent years poaching talent from rivals and added a talent surcharge on top of its existing fees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt led to some growing pains internally, as Business Insider reported, as some of the new hires clashed with some of the firm's old guard. Still, the manager is on as stable a ground as ever.\n\nThe firm's expansion to the Middle East, with a new office in Abu Dhabi, is proof that it's not slowing down, and the firm just nabbed a former Citadel portfolio manager to trade for them. Its Eureka multistrategy fund was up 14.5% through October, a person close to the firm said.\n\n6. Situational Awareness LP\n\nLeopold Aschenbrenner worked for OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA new San Francisco-based hedge fund is set to launch in the new year with serious backers and Silicon Valley-flavored team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeopold Aschenbrenner, a former OpenAI employee who graduated from Columbia at 19, is set to launch his AI-powered fund with capital from Stripe's founding brothers, Patrick and John Collison, as well as former Y Combinator partner Daniel Gross and one-time GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.\n\nNamed after a series of blogs Aschenbrenner wrote on AI's impending might, Situational Awareness will be a good test of what pure AI can do in the hypercompetitive investing industry.\n\n7. Ilex Capital\n\nIlex Capital is based in London. Karl Hendon/Getty Images\n\n2024's biggest launch, Bobby Jain's new firm, has sputtered out of the gate. One of the biggest from 2023 has not faced the same challenges \u2014 and is attracting new capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIlex Capital, a stock-picking multimanager run by former Citadel employees Jonas Diedrich and Dave Sutton out of London, is set to end the year with more than $3 billion in assets after raising another $1.5 billion this year. The firm is one of the most notable, alongside former Millennium PM Diego Megia's Taula Capital, to spin out of the big multistrategy firms.\n\nAs managers like Millennium look for places to put their ever-growing assets, deals with former employees looking to start their own firm offer an interesting opportunity.\n\n8. Lone Pine Capital\n\nLone Pine's billionaire founder Steve Mandel stepped back from the firm five years ago. YouTube/ TFANow\n\nLong-running Tiger Cub Lone Pine Capital is getting its mojo back. Its long-short hedge fund Cypress made 9% in November alone, bumping its 2024 gains to 34.3% through the year's first 11 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond strong performance though, the firm is investing in its business and looking to grow. After the retirement of its billionaire founder Steve Mandel five years ago, and the departure of buzzy industry star Mala Gaonkar in 2022, the $16 billion Connecticut-based manager has dealt with rocky performance and outflows.\n\nIn response, the firm has performed well the last two years and \u2014 for the first time in its history \u2014 put resources into its marketing. The 27-year-old manager hired Pat Cronin to be its first-ever business development leader in 2022, redid its website, and even attended last January's iConnections conference in Miami to meet with potential investors.\n\nWhile some managers slowly fade away after a founder steps back, Lone Pine has decided to ramp up \u2014 and has two strong years of performance to go off of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Renaissance Technologies\n\nRenaissance founder Jim Simons died in May of 2024. TED\n\nThe late Jim Simons had already passed the torch of his legendary quant manager Renaissance to the next generation, but his death in May was still a monumental milestone for the asset manager.\n\nRenaissance, known for the world-beating performance of its Medallion fund, which is only available to fund employees, had battled redemptions and poor performance in recent years in its largest strategies available to outside investors. But 2024 was a strong year, as its largest external fund returned close to 24% through November.\n\nUnlike some of its quant rivals like Two Sigma and D.E. Shaw, Renaissance has not expanded into non-systematic strategies. In its first year without its visionary founder, the Long Island-based manager is one to watch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Whale Rock Capital Management\n\nWhale Rock founder Alex Sacerdote has had a big year. Twitter\n\nBoston-based Whale Rock has dealt with the market's peaks and valleys in recent years. It surged 32% in 2023 after losing 40% and 9%, respectively, the two years prior. This year was another peak.\n\nThe manager's flagship fund is up 51% through November, thanks to a tech-heavy portfolio full of big-name US companies and under-the-radar international firms. A recent report notes that Alex Sacerdote's $9 billion firm plans to reopen to new capital, hoping to raise between $200 million and $300 million."

            "article_content": "There are workarounds. There are now dozens of chains running Ethereum or Ethereum-like protocols and their gas costs can be much lower. But many programmers still find that they don\u2019t need much more than a trustworthy ledger for many tasks. The relative costs of the two systems are a rough indicator of general demand. While this is always clouded by the hype and foolish dreams, it still can be a gauge for just what the people need from the systems.\n\nHot: GraphQL\n\nNot: REST\n\nIt\u2019s not as if REST is dead. It\u2019s just that we want to do more with the API, and GraphQL is a way to do it. GraphQL returns the data in JSON, just like REST. GraphQL starts off with an HTTP POST, just like many REST calls. It\u2019s just that the GraphQL syntax allows you to specify very complex queries with only a few keystrokes. This makes it simpler for programmers to ask for just what they want, and it reduces the amount of server-side work that must be done when someone wants a slightly different API.\n\nHot: Static site generators\n\nNot: Single-page apps\n\nRemember when URLs pointed to web pages filled with static text and images? Then the single-page web apps came along and replaced them all with some clever JavaScript that would fetch the content dynamically, without refreshing the entire page. Guess what? The pendulum is swinging back and all of the cool kids are building static site generators. There are dozens of them. It\u2019s like a hybrid. You put all of the data in one pile and then you write some code that sticks the data into some templates. You end up with one HTML file for each static URL, which corresponds to each row in your table of data."

            "article_content": "\"The cloud\" refers to the smooth delivery of computer services via the Internet. Businesses and individuals can use cloud computing to access computer resources, including databases, software, and storage, through the Internet and only pay for the services they use. The word \"cloud computing\" refers to a broad category of services that are constantly growing, such as software (SaaS), development platforms (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS). Instead of investing millions of dollars in on-premise infrastructure and IT staff to maintain it, businesses can concentrate on their core competencies thanks to the rapid and reasonably priced access to these services. Nowadays, it's challenging to think of a company that doesn't use cloud computing in some capacity. To stay competitive, foster collaboration, and accelerate time to market, the top performers in every industry are increasingly investing in the cloud. Given the increasing severity of cybercrimes, we predict that more and more businesses will use DevSecOps in 2025 to create highly safe software. Let's read further about Cloud Computing Trends for 2025.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat does cloud computing look like in 2025?\n\nTo improve resilience and flexibility, businesses will move increasingly to multi-cloud systems by 2025, eschewing reliance on a single vendor. Distributing workloads among several cloud providers helps enterprises maximize both cost and performance.\n\nWill AI replace cloud computing?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlthough AI is changing technology, cloud computing is unlikely to be entirely replaced by it. Instead, these technologies work in tandem to improve one another's capabilities.\n\nCloud Computing Trends for 2025\n\nGrowing Adoption of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nTo improve operational flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, businesses are shifting to hybrid and multi-cloud strategies. Thanks to this development, Businesses may now use the advantages of several cloud providers. The increased use and adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud models is the second trend on our list of the most critical cloud trends. When a company divides its data between a private cloud or on-premise data center and a public cloud, this is known as a hybrid cloud setup. Using a hybrid cloud strategy, you can choose which workload or process to move to the cloud and which data and apps to run in an internal data center.\n\nA multi-cloud environment is another computer configuration where businesses disperse their infrastructure across two or more cloud environments. Numerous advantages result from this strategy, including greater flexibility, access to particular cloud environment features, and the absence of vendor lock-in concerns. Businesses are already investing in hybrid and multi-cloud architectures to support their operations, guarantee higher customer happiness, and reduce development costs. Cloud service companies will keep improving their products over the next ten years. However, many companies will realize that implementing a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy is more beneficial.\n\nAI Integration:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAI will play a crucial role in cloud operations by automating resource allocation, scaling, and security protocols. Businesses will become more cost-effective and efficient as a result of this integration. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are essential elements of the contemporary IT environment. These technologies automate processes, decrease human error, increase operational efficiency, and produce rapid, data-driven insights.\n\nTheir applications in various industries are expanding. For instance, businesses like Netflix and Amazon employ AI to understand consumers' preferences and dislikes better and provide more tailored recommendations. However, to create and run customized models, spot trends, and forecast the future, AI and machine learning need enormous volumes of clean data\u2014a handy and crucial skill for someone in the manufacturing industry. The need for nearly limitless cloud computing resources was further accelerated by generating, storing, and processing such vast volumes of data.\n\nLeading cloud service providers now provide built-in AI and ML solutions to support their clients' innovation and AI/ML capabilities integration into their software products. Prominent companies and brands believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future and that it will likely transform how we use applications and services and do business in less than ten years. The market for cloud computing is expected to develop significantly due to the sharp increase in demand for AI and ML-driven apps and solutions, which will also fuel demand for more affordable and integrated cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEdge Computing:\n\nEdge computing will become more popular as the need for real-time data processing increases. This technology lowers latency and boosts efficiency by processing data closer to its source. Our list of the leading trends in the cloud sector also includes edge computing. The phrase \"edge computing\" is self-explanatory: it moves processing and storage closer to the gadgets that generate information and the people who utilize it. Software programs are typically made to send and receive data from remote storage sites, like cloud infrastructure or on-premises servers. For increasing use cases, this type of computing and processing configuration may not be the ideal choice.\n\nReduced latency, enhanced productivity, remote data collecting, enhanced data security and compliance, and dependable performance are just a few advantages that edge computing can help you access. Top cloud service providers like Amazon AWS also offer edge computing services to assist clients in reacting to information more quickly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nServerless Computing:\n\nAs serverless architectures become more popular, developers can concentrate on writing code rather than maintaining infrastructure, speeding up deployment times. Development teams may create and execute apps at the speed of business with serverless computing, a cloud computing execution methodology.\n\nThe computing model abstracts the intricacies of server administration from the app development process. Provisioning and administering the cloud infrastructure by the particular requirements of the software application or development team is the duty of cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. Since serverless computing is still in its infancy, not all possible applications can benefit. However, there will be significant advancements in cloud computing over the next ten years or more.

            "article_content": "Web scraping and data engineering can turn that wish into a reality. With these two, you can automate the process of gathering data from different websites and sources, processing, and organizing that data into useful actionable insights for your business. This facilitates faster and better decision-making, giving your business a competitive edge \u2013 all without the hassle of having to visit websites to manually collect, process, and organize data every now and then.\n\nEmploying web scraping services and solutions from a trusted web scraping company can help you save time, cut down manual labor, and obtain accurate, up-to-date data to allow your company to make better business decisions that would keep you ahead of the competition.\n\nWhat is web scraping?\n\nWeb scraping uses software tools to automate the process of extracting data from different websites and sources, including emerging market trends, customer reviews, stock prices, contact information, sentiment analysis, and competitor pricing. After it is extracted, the data is then converted from unstructured HTML content to structured information, making it easier to store, analyze, and use for market research, price intelligence, lead generation, or any other intended purpose. This structured format can be in the form of CSV, PDF, DOC files, or Excel spreadsheets.\n\nEssentially, web scraping provides businesses with an efficient way of collecting vast data from the web, making it a key tool for corporations in the current digital era.\n\nFor example, partnering with a data scraping company can provide access to advanced tools and expertise for extracting structured data efficiently and ethically.\n\nSo how does web scraping work?\n\nThere are a number of techniques that can be used to scrape data from the web; for instance:\n\nAPI scraping \u2013 this method uses an API (Application Programming Interface) provided in a specific website to access and extract data. Websites like Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Amazon, among others, include APIs that can be used to scrape and access data more easily and in a structured format.\n\nDOM parsing \u2013 in this method, the required data is retrieved from nodes on the webpage using DOM (Document Object Model), which transforms HTML code into a tree-like structure to make it easy to scrape the information.\n\nHTML parsing \u2013 in this web scraping approach, the HTML code is broken down into basic elements like classes, attributes, tags, and text content, making it easier to locate and scrape the relevant data.\n\nRegardless of the web scraping technique, each of these methods allows you to extract information from a website, process it, and create a data file (like a PDF or Excel spreadsheet) containing the scraped data. In general, the process includes requests being sent to a specific site\u2019s server using a bot, script, or program. After the HTML code is retrieved, the program then parses it to find specific data elements using \u201clocators\u201d like XPath, class names, or tags. Finally, the identified elements are used to get the necessary information, which is stored in a structured format like a PDF or CSV file.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say that your company wants to know the pricing of your competitors\u2019 products or services. Instead of going through the hassle of visiting their websites or social media pages to check individual products or services, you can employ the services of a web scraping company to automate the process. This includes special programs being used to analyze various web content and extract the specific data needed to eliminate the need for manually entering data. This way, the relevant data is automatically extracted across different sources, including social media platforms, blogs, e-commerce websites, and review aggregator sites, among others, and then organized in a structured format like PDF to make it easier to read, compare, and analyze.\n\nBenefits of web scraping and data engineering\n\nThe explosion of information on social media, e-commerce websites, and other websites in the past two decades has led to vast volumes of data. And with more and more organizations adopting data-driven approaches, web scraping has become a key tool for businesses to gain valuable insights. In fact, a recent Statista report shows that over 149 zettabytes of data have been generated, extracted, copied, and consumed in 2024 and projects that this figure will increase to over 394 zettabytes in the next 5 years. And with such exponential growth, data engineering and web scraping techniques are preferable over manual collection for a number of reasons, for example:\n\nCustomer analysis \u2013 web scraping allows you to study and understand customer behavior and sentiment based on reviews from different platforms, including social media and review aggregator sites like Yelp, Google My Business, and Capterra, among others.\n\nLead generation \u2013 employing web scraping services allows you to easily collect contact information from different platforms and create a list of potential clients that can also be used to create marketing campaigns.\n\nData aggregation \u2013 by automatically visiting and extracting relevant content from different sources and platforms, web scraping techniques make it easy to create a comprehensive database that can be used to provide key insights by a business to give them a competitive edge.\n\nPrice intelligence \u2013 using web scraping tools and programs, you can track real-time changes in products and services\u2019 pricing from different competitors\u2019 websites or social media platforms.\n\nMarket research \u2013 the data collected using web scraping and organized using data engineering techniques can be used to inform your company of the best business strategies to take based on the current market trends and competitor products and pricing.\n\nTo outsource or not to outsource web scraping services\n\nYou might think that web scraping is a simple process. After all, it only includes the few steps of identifying the target site, collecting the target pages\u2019 URL, making requests to the server to extract the relevant content, and saving the information in PDF or CSV files. However, you would be largely mistaken. While the process might be clear-cut for small web scraping tasks, it gets rather complex if you need to scrape data on a large scale or in other sophisticated situations. Take, for instance, if you wanted to scrape data from a site whose layout keeps changing or where you have to manage proxies, execute JavaScript, or work around antibots. Such situations would require complex scraping solutions, e.g., the constantly-changing website layout might require the implementation of a dynamic scraper that uses patterns like XPath to adapt to the changes. To bypass the antibot processes, it might mean using APIs to ensure that you are fetching data from the website ethically and legally. All these processes can be very complex, requiring technical expertise to develop advanced programs, implement them properly, and constantly monitor to ensure that everything runs smoothly and accurately.\n\nThis is one of the many reasons why it is recommendable to outsource web scraping solutions from a trusted web scraping company. Outsourcing with GroupBWT gives you a smooth operation, providing you with efficient, worry-free web scraping, content extraction, and data organization experience.\n\nWhy you need a web scraping and data engineering company\n\nGroupBWT uses advanced tools and processes that ensure efficient extraction, cleaning, and organization of data to save you time and resources while providing quality, actionable insights to facilitate decision-making processes in your business. Other key reasons include:\n\nCost-effectiveness \u2013 employing web scraping services eliminates the costs that would have been on acquiring specialized infrastructure and software as well as hiring, training, and maintaining a support team.\n\nExpertise \u2013 as one of the leading data scraping companies, GroupBWT includes some of the world\u2019s best web scraping services and state-of-the-art infrastructure to ensure that you get accurate and quality data extraction.\n\nScalability \u2013 outsourcing web scraping services and solutions means that as your company\u2019s data needs grow, you can easily scale your data collection efforts without needing to invest in additional personnel or tools.\n\nLegal compliance \u2013 with tons of experience from years of service, GroupBWT ensures that your web scraping and data extraction efforts are in line with legal and ethical guidelines, such as GDPR.\n\nRisk management \u2013 this includes ensuring that your IP isn\u2019t banned when scraping data from different platforms or experiencing disruptions.\n\nTo sum up\n\nWeb scraping solutions are beneficial for numerous reasons, including data extraction, market insights, price intelligence, competitor analysis, and real-time updates, among many others. However, the process should be undertaken in consideration of the guiding laws, industry standards, and organizational policies to ensure that it is done ethically and legally. This is why it is important to outsource from a web scraping service company to ensure compliance and responsible use of data.\n\nAt GroupBWT, we ensure that businesses get valuable insights and competitive intelligence through ethical web scraping services to avoid litigation and promote credibility."

            "article_content": "Our fascination with black holes is pretty understandable; their one-way boundary, the \"event horizon,\" traps light, meaning no signal can ever travel from inside a black hole to outside. The edge of the black hole is thus a region of space and time that expressly forbids interlopers. That's a recipe for mystery. And we all love a mystery, especially scientists.\n\nThis is compounded by the fact that at the center of the black hole lies a singularity, at which point all our laws of physics break down, making gibberish of even our most nuanced and profound achievements in physics. Approach the event horizon of a black hole on a one-way mission of discovery, and even if you survive, your distant colleagues won't be able to wave you away. Because time and space warp so dramatically at that point, you'll forever appear frozen at the edge of the event horizon.\n\nThat doesn't mean we know nothing about these cosmic titans, however. Each year, humanity makes more discoveries about black holes, some of them shocking, some of them reassuring (they are the ideal laboratories to test and confirm general relativity, our best theory of gravity), and some of them just plain weird.\n\nThe last 12 months have been no excpetion to this progress. Space.com is proud to guide you through the most important black hole discoveries of 2024.\n\n1) Fasting-growing black hole eats a sun a day!\n\nAs Christmas 2024 rolls over to New Year 2025, many of us will turn our minds to diets to offset the effects of our annual period of overindulgence. In February 2024, astronomers discovered a distant black hole that is the master of overindulgence.\n\nThe supermassive black hole is so far from Earth that it has taken 12 billion years for the light emitted by material around it to reach us. It is visible at almost the dawn of time because this monster, with a mass of between 17 billion and 19 billion times that of the sun, powers the brightest quasar ever seen by humanity.\n\nMaintaining this emission requires the black hole to consume the equivalent of the mass of the sun in gas and dust every day!\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n\"We have discovered the fastest-growing black hole known to date. It has a mass of 17 billion suns and eats just over a sun per day,\" discovery team leader and Australian National University astronomer Christian Wolf said in a statement. \"This makes it the most luminous object in the known universe.\"\n\nThis quasar, designated J0529-4351, is so luminous that if placed next to the sun, it would be 500 trillion times brighter than our star! Might as well take the Christmas lights down early.\n\nRead more: Brightest quasar ever seen is powered by black hole that eats a 'sun a day'\n\n2) 1st binary stars found around the Milky Way's supermassive black hole\n\n\ufeffBinary stars are pretty common, with over half of all stars predicted to share space with a partner. So you might be surprised to find the discovery of a binary star system on this list (especially since it is supposed to be about black holes, and this is only entry two, darn it).\n\nHowever, this discovery isn't really about what astronomers found; it's where they found it. In mid-December 2024, scientists discovered a pair of binary stars designated D9 orbiting each other close to Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way.\n\nThis is extraordinary because the immense gravity of Sgr A*, which has a mass of around 4.2 million times that of the sun, and that of other supermassive black holes was thought to be too destructive to allow binary stars to exist nearby.\n\nThough D9 is relatively young at just 2.7 million years old (compared to our 4.6 billion-year-old sun, anyway) and its discoverers expect that its two stars will soon be forced to merge, this discovery indicates that the environments around supermassive black holes might not be as turbulent as feared.\n\nThat means there is the possibility that planets may even form, albeit briefly, around the high-velocity stars whipped around by the gravity of Sgr A*.\n\n\n\n\"Black holes are not as destructive as we thought,\" research lead author and University of Cologne scientist Florian Pei\u00dfker said in a statement.\" It seems plausible that the detection of planets in the galactic center is just a matter of time.\"\n\nRead more: Astronomers discover 1st binary stars orbiting supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way\n\n3) 1st 'black hole triple' discovered\n\nCleary \"two is company\" for some stars orbiting black holes, but in October 2024 astronomers discovered to their surprise that some stars in triple systems allow a companion to stick around even after it has transformed into a black hole.\n\nThis knowledge came via the discovery of the first \"black hole triple,\" consisting of a black hole hungrily feeding on a companion star while being orbited by a more distant, cautious star.\n\nThe system V404 Cygni, which is located within the Milky Way about 8,000 light-years from Earth, was already known to astronomers and had been well studied, but it was only this year that scientists linked the more distant star with the system.\n\nAn illustration shows the black hole of V404 Cygni feeding from a stellar victim as a more cautious star in the system keeps its distance (Image credit: NASA)\n\nThe discovery is important because it implies that black holes can form in a more gentle way that doesn't \"kick away\" more loosely bound distant stars like the supernova explosions usually thought to accompany black hole birth would.\n\n\"This system is super exciting for black hole evolution, and it also raises questions of whether there are more triples out there,\" Kevin Burdge from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) told Space.com via email. \"The fact that this star is still bound is surprising because it implies it received a low-energy natal kick.\n\n\"Overall, it's not surprising that black holes should be in triples because a large fraction of massive stars are in triples, but what's surprising is that this system held onto the triple after forming the black hole.\"\n\nRead more: 1st triple black hole system discovered in 'happy accident'\n\n4) Elusive intermediate-mass black holes come out of hiding\n\nThus far on this list, we've talked about supermassive black holes with masses of millions to billions of times that of the sun and stellar-mass black holes with a much smaller mass range of 10 to 1,000 solar masses. But there must be some black holes between these two classes of black holes.\n\nIndeed there are. Intermediate-mass black holes are thought to sit within this mass gap, acting as a \"missing link\" that helps some black holes reach supermassive status. The prefix \"missing\" applies because this class of black hole has been frustratingly elusive.\n\nIn July of 2024, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers caught sight of what they believe is a missing link black hole in Omega Centauri, the remains of a galaxy long ago cannibalized by the Milky Way.\n\nThis act of cosmic cannibalism deprived this intermediate-mass black hole of the food it needed to grow past its mass of 8,200 times that of the sun, effectively \"freezing it in time.\"\n\n\"At a distance of about 18,000 light-years, this is the closest known example of a massive black hole,\" team member and Max Planck Institute for Astronomy Ph.D. student Maximilian H\u00e4berle said in a statement.\n\nThe following month, a separate team of researchers discovered evidence of a different intermediate-mass black hole, this time lurking near the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) at the heart of the Milky Way, some 27,000 light-years from Earth.\n\nYou wait ages for a medium-sized black hole, and then two turn up nearly at once.\n\nRead more: Hubble Space Telescope finds closest massive black hole to Earth \u2014 a cosmic clue frozen in time\n\n5) Supermassive black hole throws a tantrum\n\nIn 2018, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) revealed to the world the first image of a black hole, namely the supermassive black hole at the heart of the distant galaxy Messier 87 (M87).\n\nSix years later, the study of this black hole, designated M87*, which has a mass equal to about 5.4 billion suns, by the EHT is still delivering important science. In December 2024, the scientists behind the project revealed that the EHT, comprised of telescopes around the globe that form a virtual Earth-sized instrument, witnessed the same black hole erupt with a powerful and unexpected explosion.\n\nLight curve of the gamma-ray flare (bottom) and collection of quasi-simultaneous images of the M87 jet (top) at various scales obtained in radio and X-rays during the 2018 campaign. (Image credit: EHT Collaboration, Fermi-LAT Collaboration, HESS Collaboration, MAGIC Collaboration, VERITAS Collaboration, EAVN Collaboration)\n\nThis gamma-ray flare lasted for three days at the end of April 2018. Not only was this the first time M87* has flared since 2010, but this blast was more energetic than previous emissions.\n\nBy studying this blast, EHT scientists hope to learn more about the structure around supermassive black holes, particularly the flattened disks of gas and dust that feed them called accretion disks. The emission has already revealed that the jet of high-speed particles erupting from M87* at near-light speed stretches so far that its emergence from M87* was compared to a blue whale erupting from a single bacteria.\n\n\"In particular, these results offer the first-ever chance to identify the point at which the particles that cause the flare are accelerated, which could potentially resolve a long-standing debate about the origin of cosmic rays [very high-energy particles] from space detected on Earth,\" team leader and University of Trieste researcher Giacomo Principe said in a statement.\n\nRead more: 1st monster black hole ever pictured erupts with surprise gamma-ray explosion\n\n6) Gaia discovers sleeping giant black hole close to Earth\n\nIn April 2024, the star-tracking space telescope Gaia discovered its third black hole. Not only is this black hole, known as \"BH3,\" the second closest to Earth at just 2,000 light-years away (the closest black hole, BH1, was also discovered by Gaia, but in 2023), it is also a bit of a monster.\n\nBH3 has a mass equivalent to around 33 suns. While that means it pales into insignificance compared to supermassive black holes, compared to other close stellar-mass black holes, BH3 is pretty monstrous. It's a bit like comparing Frankenstein's monster to Godzilla.\n\nThis was the first time that such a massive stellar-mass black hole has been found close to Earth.\n\nA diagram showing the location of the three black holes discovered by Gaia (Image credit: ESA/Gaia Collaboration)\n\n\"Finding Gaia BH3 is like the moment in the film 'The Matrix' where Neo starts to 'see' the matrix,\" George Seabroke, a scientist at Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London and a member of Gaia's Black Hole Task Force, said in a statement sent to Space.com. \"In our case, 'the matrix' is our galaxy\u2019s population of dormant stellar black holes, which were hidden from us before Gaia detected them.\"\n\nThe discovery team's lead researcher, Pasquale Panuzzo of CNRS, Observatoire de Paris in France, said in a statement: \"This is the kind of discovery you make once in your research life.\"\n\nRead more: Record breaker! Milky Way's most monstrous stellar-mass black hole is sleeping giant lurking close to Earth (video)\n\n7) A new look at 'our' supermassive black hole\n\nThis list has taken us out to the very edge of the observable universe to look at some of the earliest black holes. What better way to wrap up than returning home to pop in on Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy?\n\nThis isn't just a cursory visit, though; Sgr A* was making news in 2024, particularly in March, when the EHT caught a new aspect of the familiar black hole. The Earth-sized virtual telescope was able to capture Sgr A* in polarized light for the first time.\n\nThe supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way, Sgr A*, seen in polarized light for the first time (Image credit: EHT Collaboration)\n\nNot only did this new observation reveal that powerful magnetic fields are well organized around Sgr A* just as they are around the much more massive M87*, but it hinted at an undiscovered feature about our black hole.\n\n\"We expect strong and ordered magnetic fields to be directly linked to the launching of jets as we observed for M87*,\" Sara Issaoun, research co-leader and NASA Hubble Fellowship Program Einstein Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) at Harvard & Smithsonian told Space.com. \"Since Sgr A*, with no observed jet, seems to have a very similar geometry, perhaps there is also a jet lurking in Sgr A* waiting to be observed, which would be super exciting!\"\n\nMaybe further evidence of such a jet will manifest itself in 2025.\n\nRead more: New view of the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way hints at an exciting hidden feature (image)\n\nAs mentioned above, black holes like to keep their secrets close to their hearts, so who knows what major developments will make it to this list in twelve months as 2025 draws to a close.\n\nOne thing that is no mystery, however: Just as we have been for the past quarter of a century, Space.com will be there in 2025 to document every step taken in the quest to understand black holes, and we hope you will be right there beside us."

            "article_content": "Canton Repository entertainment writer lists what he's most looking forward to in 2025.\n\nEd Balint's top 10 list includes local food discoveries, Finney's Arcade in downtown Canton and Mural Fest 2.\n\nBig concerts in 2025 will include Pearl Jam selling out two shows in Pittsburgh, and another headliner at the Concert for Legends in Canton.\n\nA new year always holds the promise of good times and stress relief \u2014 music, concerts, amusement parks, the outdoors, local art, tasty eats and more.\n\n2024 was chock-full of personal highlights, from a trip abroad with my 18-year-old daughter as she embarked on her post high school life to meeting one of my rock 'n' roll heroes backstage \u2014 Gary Cherone, who briefly fronted the mighty Van Halen, one of my all-time favorite bands.\n\nNext year has the potential to please, too, from snagging tickets to a sold-out concert to anticipating the insanity of a new thrill ride to carving up the slopes. Here are the top 10 things I'm looking forward to in 2025, although whittling down the list wasn't easy.\n\n1. Finney's Arcade in downtown Canton\n\nFinney's Arcade & Parlor checks my box for nostalgia.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nRyan Miller, owner of the successful Deli Ohio in downtown Canton, said Finney's Arcade, 417 Market Ave. N, will be retro in character and vibe, as well as in the rotating video game and pinball inventory.\n\nOld souls will appreciate Skee-Ball and Pop-A-Shot! Newer video and pinball games are also planned such as Avatar and John Wick.\n\nBesides the games, Finney's Arcade is partnering with UnHitched Brewing Co. and its downtown spot The Woodshop to create a custom brew \u2014 Finney's Brew Skee Ball Cream Ale, described as light, crisp and refreshing.\n\nThe arcade is scheduled to open in the first quarter of next year. And I'm rooting for Miller and his business partner, Micah Dorward, to pull off another entrepreneurial triumph and inject a cool new entertainment option downtown.\n\n2. Hail, Hail Pearl Jam\n\nThat's a reference to a song from Pearl Jam's 1996 album, \"No Code.\"\n\nBack when Pearl Jam were bona fide rock stars and pioneers of the grunge rock scene and Seattle sound. Fast forward to 2024, and Pearl Jam is remarkably and impressively still intact and musically potent.\n\nOther grunge bands sadly have lost their frontmen. Nirvana and Kurt Cobain. Soundgarden and Chris Cornell. Alice In Chains and Layne Staley. Stone Temple Pilots and Scott Weiland.\n\nVocalist Eddie Vedder and bandmates have transitioned into elder statesmen of the modern rock scene. Pearl Jam is also a highly successful touring act, selling out shows and curating a new setlist for each concert while playing for around three hours.\n\nPearl Jam is hitting the road next year, but announced only 10 concerts. That's why I'm stoked to have snagged tickets to the first of two Pittsburgh dates in May. Seats are in the upper deck, but just being there is the point.\n\n3. Pizza Palooza in North Canton\n\nA food fest arrives early with North Canton's new Pizza Palooza on Feb. 2.\n\nPizza Palooza will be in the cafeteria of Hoover High, 525 Seventh St. NE.\n\nMy only disappointment is the timing. Pizza Palooza screams summertime and outdoors. Casting that quibble aside, count me in. Pizza is my No. 1 favorite food. All types, all shops, all countries.\n\nPizza masters will include Luigi's in Akron, who I consider to be the Cadillac of za. Nothing compares to its robust, distinctive flavor. The dough, the sauce, the cheese baked a beautiful golden brown. It's pizza perfection.\n\nGrab a slicePizza paradise coming to North Canton with new Pizza Palooza event\n\nCanton shops also will be showcasing their pizza prowess. Lots of standouts, including the OGs of the local scene \u2212 Pizza Oven and Italo's. Also excellent are Park City Pizza and SOL Pie Pizza. Zepp's also has a loyal legion of fans.\n\nToo many to choose from? Don't fret. A passport ticket allows you to indulge in multiple pizzerias.\n\nTickets can be purchased at https://ticketscandy.com/e/2025-pizza-palooza-7254.\n\n4. Siren's Curse at Cedar Point\n\nCedar Point has been a summertime tradition with my daughter since she was a toddler.\n\nWe're ride warriors no matter the month. Busy times, slow times, sweltering August days ... and even a few years ago on Nov. 1 when snowflakes were falling.\n\nEach summer, Paige advanced to more thrilling rides. Until the insanity stage hit in her teenage years. All the biggies \u2014 Magnum XL\u2212200, Millennium Force, Steel Vengeance, Maverick, Valravn and Top Thrill 2, which is scheduled to reopen in 2025. But Cedar Point is once again trying to top itself with the introduction of Siren's Curse in 2025.\n\nThe newest scream machine will be the tallest, fastest and longest tilt coaster in North America, the amusement park boasts.\n\nHighlights include a 160-foot tower, 90-degree vertical position, and plunging and zooming on nearly 3,000 feet of track before reaching a top speed of 58 mph. And there's more \u2014 13 weightless airtime moments and two 360-degree, zero-gravity barrel rolls.\n\nYowza! My daughter undoubtedly will be game. I'll take some convincing.\n\n5. Snowboarding in the ... spring\n\nLearning how to snowboard was knocked off my bucket list years ago. And it's become a passion and way to spend quality time with my daughter for more than a decade.\n\nWe frequently take to the slopes of the Cuyahoga Valley. For more challenging terrain, we day trip to Seven Springs in Pennsylvania. And we recently took advantage of an early-season discount in rates at The Inn at Holiday Valley in Western New York.\n\nBut what I love perhaps even more than carving the hills in December, January and February is doing so in March. Spring skiing and snowboarding can be sloppy due to warming temperatures. Regardless, it's still glorious to slay the slopes in early spring under a sunlit blue sky while wearing a fleece sans a bulky jacket.\n\n6. Mural Fest 2\n\nCanton Mural Fest was a vibrant new addition to Stark County's roster of summer events last year.\n\nAround a dozen artists created eye-catching and inspired murals in the Cherry and Walnut Avenue NE area. Special ones include a sprawling, multi-colored peregrine falcon at the Strauss Studios building, and a racoon in Boy Scout attire near Deli Ohio.\n\nAnother is a gorgeous tribute to The O'Jays, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame singing group hailing from Canton. Imparting a throwback and classic vibe, it's a beauty, created by Northeast Ohio artist Derrin Fletcher and stretching 40 feet.\n\nFellow art lovers can look forward to the second Canton Mural Fest in 2025. Maureen Ater, CEO of ArtsinStark, said the goal is to have the follow-up event in September.\n\n\"We don't expect that in our second year we will unveil 14 murals like we did this year,\" she said. \"But continuing to grow the number of murals from this original 14 was always part of our goal.\"\n\n7. More food discoveries like Liebermann's Bakery\n\nI'm embarrassed to admit it took me this long to discover the legend of Liebermann's Bakery\n\nNot only are the baked goods scrumptious, but the friendliness of the staff was exemplary on a recent visit to Liebermann's, 49 First St. SE, in downtown Massillon.\n\nLiebermann's raspberry-filled doughnuts are sublime. A ginormous pastry combined elements of a cinnamon roll and glazed doughnut, topped with a generous amount of peanut butter icing. Wow! Flaky and light and originally delicious, I loved it. There's nothing else quite like it.\n\nLiebermann's awakened the need to be a culinary adventurer. And I look forward to more local food finds in 2025.\n\n8. Canton area music festivals and concerts\n\nEach summer, I anticipate Stark County's big music events that draw nationally touring performers.\n\nI'm eager to learn who will be headlining the Concert for Legends during the Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Festival. The Hall of Fame Village hasn't disappointed the last three years, booking Journey, Zac Brown Band and Carrie Underwood.\n\nCountry star:6 fun and cool things about the Carrie Underwood show at the Pro Football HOF Fest\n\nAlive Music Festival, The Country Fest and Neon Nights are also highly recommended for even casual fans of their respective genres. The relaxed, welcoming and festive atmosphere at each event is as good as the music.\n\nNeon Nights is an increasingly stellar sister event to The Country Fest, mixing country and classic rock. Foreigner, Brooks & Dunn, Night Ranger and Bret Michaels should make for a rousing, raise your drink in the air affair in August.\n\n9. More Civic Center concerts\n\nAnother big concert is coming to the Canton Memorial Civic Center.\n\nCeCe Winans, a Grammy-winning gospel singing legend, will open her tour at the 73-year-old downtown arena on Feb. 12.\n\nDowntown arena:'Possibilities are endless.' City, business leaders discuss future of Canton Civic Center\n\nWhile working on an extensive series of articles about the future of the Civic Center, I gained a new appreciation for its rich history and continued relevance as a concert venue.\n\nBoth the Brantley Gilbert and Chris Tomlin shows were outstanding in 2024, far exceeding my expectations for a concert at the 5,200-seat arena. Acoustics, atmosphere and the view were tremendous.\n\nI'm eager to see what else the Civic Center books in 2025.\n\n10. Tent camping\n\nTent camping is another family favorite.\n\nBeach vacations are fun. European adventures are amazing. But camping in the wilderness at a state or national park is in a class of its own.\n\nThere's a lot of work and preparation \u2014 loading a cargo box on the roof of an SUV; going through a detailed checklist of camping and cooking supplies and other essentials; and then unpacking it all and setting up camp while hoping it doesn't rain.\n\nBut it's well worth the effort and inconveniences. Rewards include falling asleep to the sound of wind blowing through towering pines; gazing up at the glitter of a star-filled night sky; and campfire breakfasts with crispy bacon, fried potatoes and scrambled eggs that can't be replicated at restaurants.\n\nFinding new camping spots is part of the fun. This past summer, we experienced Letchworth State Park in Western New York. And what a prize it is, adorned with waterfalls, ravines, creeks and woodlands.\n\nAnother camping gem awaits discovery in 2025. High on my list are Blackwater Falls State Park in West Virginia and Indiana Dunes National Park in Indiana.\n\nReach Ed at ebalint@gannett.com.

            "article_content": "There are workarounds. There are now dozens of chains running Ethereum or Ethereum-like protocols and their gas costs can be much lower. But many programmers still find that they don\u2019t need much more than a trustworthy ledger for many tasks. The relative costs of the two systems are a rough indicator of general demand. While this is always clouded by the hype and foolish dreams, it still can be a gauge for just what the people need from the systems.\n\nHot: GraphQL\n\nNot: REST\n\nIt\u2019s not as if REST is dead. It\u2019s just that we want to do more with the API, and GraphQL is a way to do it. GraphQL returns the data in JSON, just like REST. GraphQL starts off with an HTTP POST, just like many REST calls. It\u2019s just that the GraphQL syntax allows you to specify very complex queries with only a few keystrokes. This makes it simpler for programmers to ask for just what they want, and it reduces the amount of server-side work that must be done when someone wants a slightly different API.\n\nHot: Static site generators\n\nNot: Single-page apps\n\nRemember when URLs pointed to web pages filled with static text and images? Then the single-page web apps came along and replaced them all with some clever JavaScript that would fetch the content dynamically, without refreshing the entire page. Guess what? The pendulum is swinging back and all of the cool kids are building static site generators. There are dozens of them. It\u2019s like a hybrid. You put all of the data in one pile and then you write some code that sticks the data into some templates. You end up with one HTML file for each static URL, which corresponds to each row in your table of data."

            "article_content": "\"The cloud\" refers to the smooth delivery of computer services via the Internet. Businesses and individuals can use cloud computing to access computer resources, including databases, software, and storage, through the Internet and only pay for the services they use. The word \"cloud computing\" refers to a broad category of services that are constantly growing, such as software (SaaS), development platforms (PaaS), and infrastructure (IaaS). Instead of investing millions of dollars in on-premise infrastructure and IT staff to maintain it, businesses can concentrate on their core competencies thanks to the rapid and reasonably priced access to these services. Nowadays, it's challenging to think of a company that doesn't use cloud computing in some capacity. To stay competitive, foster collaboration, and accelerate time to market, the top performers in every industry are increasingly investing in the cloud. Given the increasing severity of cybercrimes, we predict that more and more businesses will use DevSecOps in 2025 to create highly safe software. Let's read further about Cloud Computing Trends for 2025.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhat does cloud computing look like in 2025?\n\nTo improve resilience and flexibility, businesses will move increasingly to multi-cloud systems by 2025, eschewing reliance on a single vendor. Distributing workloads among several cloud providers helps enterprises maximize both cost and performance.\n\nWill AI replace cloud computing?\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlthough AI is changing technology, cloud computing is unlikely to be entirely replaced by it. Instead, these technologies work in tandem to improve one another's capabilities.\n\nCloud Computing Trends for 2025\n\nGrowing Adoption of Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Environments:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nTo improve operational flexibility and prevent vendor lock-in, businesses are shifting to hybrid and multi-cloud strategies. Thanks to this development, Businesses may now use the advantages of several cloud providers. The increased use and adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud models is the second trend on our list of the most critical cloud trends. When a company divides its data between a private cloud or on-premise data center and a public cloud, this is known as a hybrid cloud setup. Using a hybrid cloud strategy, you can choose which workload or process to move to the cloud and which data and apps to run in an internal data center.\n\nA multi-cloud environment is another computer configuration where businesses disperse their infrastructure across two or more cloud environments. Numerous advantages result from this strategy, including greater flexibility, access to particular cloud environment features, and the absence of vendor lock-in concerns. Businesses are already investing in hybrid and multi-cloud architectures to support their operations, guarantee higher customer happiness, and reduce development costs. Cloud service companies will keep improving their products over the next ten years. However, many companies will realize that implementing a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy is more beneficial.\n\nAI Integration:\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAI will play a crucial role in cloud operations by automating resource allocation, scaling, and security protocols. Businesses will become more cost-effective and efficient as a result of this integration. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are essential elements of the contemporary IT environment. These technologies automate processes, decrease human error, increase operational efficiency, and produce rapid, data-driven insights.\n\nTheir applications in various industries are expanding. For instance, businesses like Netflix and Amazon employ AI to understand consumers' preferences and dislikes better and provide more tailored recommendations. However, to create and run customized models, spot trends, and forecast the future, AI and machine learning need enormous volumes of clean data\u2014a handy and crucial skill for someone in the manufacturing industry. The need for nearly limitless cloud computing resources was further accelerated by generating, storing, and processing such vast volumes of data.\n\nLeading cloud service providers now provide built-in AI and ML solutions to support their clients' innovation and AI/ML capabilities integration into their software products. Prominent companies and brands believe that artificial intelligence (AI) is the way of the future and that it will likely transform how we use applications and services and do business in less than ten years. The market for cloud computing is expected to develop significantly due to the sharp increase in demand for AI and ML-driven apps and solutions, which will also fuel demand for more affordable and integrated cloud infrastructure and services.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nEdge Computing:\n\nEdge computing will become more popular as the need for real-time data processing increases. This technology lowers latency and boosts efficiency by processing data closer to its source. Our list of the leading trends in the cloud sector also includes edge computing. The phrase \"edge computing\" is self-explanatory: it moves processing and storage closer to the gadgets that generate information and the people who utilize it. Software programs are typically made to send and receive data from remote storage sites, like cloud infrastructure or on-premises servers. For increasing use cases, this type of computing and processing configuration may not be the ideal choice.\n\nReduced latency, enhanced productivity, remote data collecting, enhanced data security and compliance, and dependable performance are just a few advantages that edge computing can help you access. Top cloud service providers like Amazon AWS also offer edge computing services to assist clients in reacting to information more quickly.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nServerless Computing:\n\nAs serverless architectures become more popular, developers can concentrate on writing code rather than maintaining infrastructure, speeding up deployment times. Development teams may create and execute apps at the speed of business with serverless computing, a cloud computing execution methodology.\n\nThe computing model abstracts the intricacies of server administration from the app development process. Provisioning and administering the cloud infrastructure by the particular requirements of the software application or development team is the duty of cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS. Since serverless computing is still in its infancy, not all possible applications can benefit. However, there will be significant advancements in cloud computing over the next ten years or more. These advancements will undoubtedly make cloud computing a far more thrilling, cost-effective, and speed-driven experience for businesses and individuals everywhere.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nLow-Code and No-Code Platforms:\n\nBy enabling individuals with little to no coding knowledge to create applications, these platforms will democratize app creation and lessen reliance on IT departments. AI-powered low-code and no-code cloud solutions are the newest talking points among tech and business leaders and the development community.\n\nLow-code and no-code development has seen significant investments from many start-ups and well-established IT giants in Silicon Valley and other parts of the world. Because of this, LCNC platforms are included in our list of important cloud technology developments for 2025 and beyond. These cloud-based solutions, which appear to be magical, abstract away the complexity of coding and make it more accessible to all types of enterprises. The development and uptake of low-code and no-code technology are still in their infancy."

However, the rise in fraudulent expense claims poses a significant challenge for organizations worldwide. Fraudulent activities not only drain resources but also damage trust within the workplace. Detecting such fraud manually can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. This is where machine learning comes into play, offering innovative ways to combat expense fraud efficiently and proactively.\n\nWhat Is Expense Fraud?\n\nExpense fraud refers to the act of submitting false or exaggerated claims for reimbursement. Employees may manipulate receipts, inflate mileage claims, or create fake invoices to gain undeserved compensation. Common examples of expense fraud include:\n\nSubmitting personal expenses as business-related costs.\n\nAltering the amounts on genuine receipts.\n\nCreating entirely fictitious receipts or invoices.\n\nReimbursing duplicate claims for the same expense.\n\nThese fraudulent activities can cost businesses thousands, if not millions, of dollars annually. While traditional audits can uncover some discrepancies, they often miss more sophisticated schemes. This highlights the need for advanced technologies like machine learning to tackle fraud more effectively.\n\nThe Role of Machine Learning in Fraud Detection\n\nMachine learning (ML) leverages algorithms that analyze data, learn patterns, and make predictions. Unlike rule-based systems, ML models continuously improve over time as they process new data. In the context of expense fraud detection, machine learning offers the following advantages:\n\nAutomated Data Analysis: ML systems can process vast amounts of expense data in real time, identifying anomalies that may signal fraudulent behavior.\n\nPattern Recognition: By analyzing historical data, machine learning models can detect unusual patterns that deviate from normal expense behaviors.\n\nRisk Scoring: ML algorithms assign risk scores to expense claims, flagging those with high likelihoods of fraud for further review.\n\nAdaptive Learning: As fraud tactics evolve, machine learning models adapt by learning new patterns and identifying emerging threats.\n\nKey Machine Learning Techniques for Expense Fraud Detection\n\nMachine learning employs various techniques to identify fraudulent expense claims. Below are some of the most commonly used approaches:\n\nSupervised Learning\n\nSupervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where the outcomes (fraudulent or non-fraudulent) are already known. The model learns to classify new expense claims based on the patterns it observes in the training data. Algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks are commonly used in supervised learning for fraud detection.\n\nUnsupervised Learning\n\nUnlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. This approach is ideal for detecting unknown types of fraud. Techniques like clustering and anomaly detection help group similar data points and identify outliers. For instance, if an employee\u2019s expense claim is significantly higher than their peers\u2019, the system flags it for investigation.\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nNatural language processing is used to analyze text-based data, such as descriptions in expense claims. NLP can identify inconsistencies, suspicious keywords, or unusual phrasing that may indicate fraudulent intent.\n\nReinforcement Learning\n\nReinforcement learning involves training models through a reward-based system. In fraud detection, the algorithm receives rewards for accurately identifying fraudulent claims and penalties for false positives or negatives. This iterative process improves the model\u2019s accuracy over time.\n\nBuilding an Effective Machine Learning Framework for Fraud Detection\n\nImplementing a machine learning-based expense fraud detection system requires careful planning and execution. Below are the critical steps:\n\nData Collection and Preprocessing\n\nThe first step is gathering expense-related data, such as receipts, invoices, and transaction records. Preprocessing this data is crucial to ensure accuracy and consistency. Steps include:\n\nCleaning and removing duplicate entries.\n\nConverting unstructured data into structured formats.\n\nNormalizing numerical data for better model performance.\n\nFeature Engineering\n\nFeature engineering involves selecting and creating relevant variables (features) that help the model identify fraud. Examples include:\n\nFrequency of claims per employee.\n\nAverage claim amount by department.\n\nExpense categories with unusually high costs.\n\nModel Training and Testing\n\nOnce features are defined, the next step is training machine learning models. A portion of the data is used for training, while the rest is reserved for testing. This ensures that the model performs well on unseen data.\n\nDeployment and Monitoring\n\nAfter successful testing, the model is deployed to monitor expense claims in real-time. Continuous monitoring and periodic retraining are essential to maintain effectiveness and adapt to new fraud patterns.\n\nChallenges in Machine Learning-Based Fraud Detection\n\nWhile machine learning offers powerful tools for expense fraud detection, it is not without challenges. Some common obstacles include:\n\nData Quality Issues: Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to unreliable model predictions.\n\nHigh False Positives: Over-sensitive models may flag legitimate claims as fraudulent, leading to inefficiencies.\n\nEvolving Fraud Tactics: Fraudsters continuously adapt, requiring models to be updated regularly.\n\nPrivacy Concerns: Handling sensitive financial data necessitates strict adherence to data protection regulations.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a collaborative approach involving robust data governance, regular model audits, and input from domain experts.\n\nBenefits of Machine Learning in Expense Fraud Detection\n\nDespite the challenges, machine learning brings numerous benefits to expense fraud detection:\n\nEfficiency: Automating fraud detection reduces the manual workload, allowing finance teams to focus on high-priority tasks.\n\nAccuracy: ML models often outperform traditional methods, identifying subtle patterns that humans might miss.\n\nScalability: Machine learning systems can handle large volumes of data, making them suitable for organizations of all sizes.\n\nCost Savings: By preventing fraud, businesses can save significant amounts of money that would otherwise be lost.\n\nReal-World Applications of Machine Learning in Expense Fraud Detection\n\nMany organizations have successfully implemented machine learning to combat expense fraud. For instance:\n\nCorporate Finance Departments: Large corporations use ML tools to monitor employee expense reports, flagging anomalies in real-time.\n\nExpense Management Software: Companies like Expensify and Concur integrate machine learning algorithms to provide fraud detection features for their clients.\n\nFinancial Institutions: Banks and credit card companies employ ML models to detect suspicious transactions that could indicate fraudulent expense claims.\n\nConclusion\n\nExpense fraud is a pressing issue that requires proactive measures to mitigate its impact on businesses. Machine learning offers a transformative solution, enabling organizations to detect and prevent fraud with unprecedented efficiency.Furthermore, By leveraging techniques like supervised and unsupervised learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning, companies can build robust fraud detection systems that evolve alongside emerging threats. Although challenges remain, the benefits of machine learning far outweigh the drawbacks, making it an indispensable tool in the fight against expense fraud.

It lost some of its most experienced troops at the very start of the invasion, then shipped off tens of thousands of convicts without seeming to care whether they survived.\n\nNow, still desperately seeking sufficient manpower to maintain pressure on Ukraine, Russia has expanded recruitment even more. Men (and women) no longer have to be convicted of a crime \u2014 under new laws, any suspects detained by the police are informed that pending charges will disappear if they volunteer. The military also is taking anyone with large, unpaid debts; recent immigrants caught in repeated dragnets; and even corrupt officials.\n\nIn one recent example from St. Petersburg, two men were arrested on charges of smuggling about 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of cocaine from Peru, worth roughly $30 million, in the roof of a container filled with more than 5,000 cases of mangoes, according to the press service of the St. Petersburg court system. The charges were dropped after the two signed contracts to serve as riflemen in an assault company, the court said.\n\nLocal papers nationwide are full of cases of suspected murderers, rapists and thieves who are headed off to war after signing contracts instead of facing trial."

            "article_content": "2024 marked an unprecedented crisis for children globally, with record numbers displaced, malnourished, and deprived of basic rights due to escalating conflicts.\n\nQuick Summary:\n\n\u2022 Over 473 million children\u20141 in 6 globally\u2014lived in conflict zones in 2024, nearly double the percentage in the 1990s.\n\n\u2022 47.2 million children were forcibly displaced by conflict and violence, with children making up 40% of refugees and nearly half of internally displaced people.\n\n\u2022 Grave violations against children, including killings, maimings, and sexual violence, reached record levels, with thousands killed or injured in Gaza and Ukraine in 2024.\n\n\u2022 More than 52 million children were out of school due to conflict, as educational infrastructure in Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine was destroyed or repurposed.\n\n\u2022 Malnutrition skyrocketed, with over half a million people in conflict zones experiencing famine-like conditions, disproportionately affecting children.\n\n\u2022 Children in war zones face severe mental health impacts, including depression, nightmares, and behavioral issues, as violence and loss disrupt their lives.\n\n\u2022 Humanitarian access is increasingly restricted, with 2024 being the deadliest year on record for aid workers, complicating relief efforts.\n\nMore than 473 million children\u20141 in 6 globally\u2014are living in conflict zones, making 2024 one of the most devastating years for children in conflict in the history of UNICEF. This grim reality reflects a world marred by escalating wars, displacement, and systemic failures to protect the most vulnerable. UNICEF\u2019s Executive Director Catherine Russell warned, \u201cWe cannot allow a generation of children to become collateral damage to the world\u2019s unchecked wars.\u201d\n\nThe report sheds light on a stark reality: children affected by conflicts are increasingly deprived of education, healthcare, and basic necessities. Entire childhoods are being shaped by war, with devastating consequences for future generations.\n\nA record number of children impacted by conflict are having their rights brutally violated.\n\n\n\nUNICEF is calling for all parties to conflict, and for those with influence over them, to take decisive action to end the suffering of children. pic.twitter.com/7NsDhqHanl \u2014 UNICEF (@UNICEF) December 28, 2024\n\nAs conflicts in Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine, and Haiti intensified in 2024, displacement reached unprecedented levels. By the end of 2023, over 47.2 million children had been forcibly displaced due to violence and war, with the numbers climbing further in 2024. Children account for 40% of global refugees and nearly half of all internally displaced people, despite making up just 30% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nThe number of children living in conflict zones has almost doubled since the 1990s, increasing from 10% to 19%. These children face disproportionate risks of malnutrition, homelessness, disease, and violence. In many cases, they are forced to flee repeatedly, losing any semblance of stability in their lives.\n\nGrave violations of children\u2019s rights, including killings, maimings, and sexual violence, have surged. In 2023 alone, the United Nations verified 32,990 grave violations against 22,557 children\u2014the highest number ever recorded.\n\nUNICEF expects 2024 to exceed those figures, citing examples such as Gaza, where thousands of children have been killed or injured, and Ukraine, which saw more child casualties in the first nine months of 2024 than in all of 2023.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire for vulnerable groups:\n\n\u2022 Girls face heightened risks of sexual violence. Haiti reported a 1,000% increase in child sexual violence cases in 2024.\n\n\u2022 Children with disabilities are disproportionately affected, often facing neglect and violence in conflict zones.\n\nEducation and Healthcare in Ruins\n\nThe destruction of infrastructure and prolonged insecurity have disrupted essential services for children, including education and healthcare.\n\n\u2022 Education: More than 52 million children are out of school in conflict-affected countries.\n\n\u2022 In Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine, schools have been bombed, repurposed, or abandoned, leaving millions without access to learning.\n\n\u2022 Many children in Gaza and Sudan have missed more than a year of education due to prolonged violence.\n\n\u2022 Healthcare: Around 40% of unvaccinated or undervaccinated children live in conflict zones, making them particularly vulnerable to preventable diseases such as measles and polio.\n\nConflict is the leading driver of hunger, and malnutrition rates in war-torn regions are skyrocketing. In 2024, more than half a million people across five conflict-affected countries faced famine-like conditions (IPC Phase 5). These dire circumstances are exacerbated by the destruction of food systems, displacement of populations, and restricted humanitarian access.\n\nChildren bear the brunt of this crisis:\n\n\u2022 Malnutrition is stunting their growth and development.\n\n\u2022 In Sudan, famine conditions were determined in North Darfur\u2014the first such determination since 2017.\n\nThe mental health toll on children in conflict zones is severe. Exposure to violence, destruction, and loss manifests in depression, nightmares, and behavioral changes. Many children grapple with fear, sadness, and withdrawal, while others show signs of aggression and hopelessness.\n\n\u201cChildren in war zones face a daily struggle for survival that deprives them of a childhood,\u201d said Russell. \u201cTheir schools are bombed, homes destroyed, and families torn apart. They lose not only their safety and access to basic life-sustaining necessities but also their chance to play, to learn, and to simply be children.\u201d\n\nAid workers face increasing dangers in delivering assistance to children and families. In 2024, 281 humanitarian personnel were killed globally\u2014the highest number on record. Attacks on aid workers further restrict access to life-saving services, worsening conditions for children in conflict zones.\n\nGovernments and international organizations must prioritize adhering to international humanitarian law to ensure children\u2019s safety.\n\nUNICEF is urging global leaders to act decisively to end the suffering of children in war zones. Investments in education, healthcare, and food security are critical to safeguarding their future. The organization is also calling on parties to conflict to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law.\n\n\u201cAs we look towards 2025, we must do more to turn the tide and save and improve the lives of children,\u201d said Russell. \u201cThe world is failing these children, and it is our responsibility to act now to protect them.\u201d"

            "article_content": "In the ferocious civil war between ethnic rebel groups and the junta (military) in Myanmar, the Arakan Army, the biggest of all the rebel groups, is now in control of large parts of the Rakhine province. The security dynamics along Myanmar's border with Bangladesh have considerably altered in the second week of December as the junta lost control over the area.\n\nThis uncertainty is bound to have a spillover effect along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, raising concerns of a fresh wave of Rohingya refugees attempting to escape the region. Myanmar has been consumed by civil war after the military coup in 2021, which ousted the democratically-run government.\n\nFor the world grappling with wars in Europe and West Asia, Myanmar's strife is forgotten. Except as the looming reality for its neighbours, the world doesn't seem to remember the disastrous events unfolding within Myanmar and the volatile politics consuming it. India is closely watching the developments as there may be implications.\n\nWhy the continuing strife?\n\nDeprived of fair play, various ethnic armed organisations like the Arakan Army have been battling the military since independence for autonomy and control of beneficial resources.\n\nThe Arakan Army is part of the anti-junta group called Three Brotherhood Alliance (the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army are the other two). The same alliance had initiated an assault in October 2023, gaining several considerable wins along Myanmar's border with China.\n\nIn August this year, the alliance gained command of the north-eastern town of Lashio, indicating the first capture of a regional military command in Myanmar's history.\n\nThere are even reports that the Arakan Army now commands areas inside Bangladesh along the Myanmar-Bangladesh border and that may lead to a fight between Bangladesh Army and the Arakan Army and exacerbate the security crisis in the region.\n\nExperts say the Arakan Army operates as the military wing of the ULA (United League of Arakan), the political organisation of the Buddhist people in Myanmar's western Rakhine state.\n\nIn the last 15 months, the Arakan Army has gained ground, capturing dozens of townships and military outposts. The group's continuous capture of regions in its fold have raised questions about its motive.\n\nMyanmar has never recognised the Rohingya community residing in the Rakhine province as its citizens. In 2017, after a brutal crackdown on Rohingya villages by Myanmar's military, hundreds of thousands Rohingya fled across the border into neighbouring Bangladesh to escape the atrocities. India has faced an influx of Rohingya refugees since then.\n\nAs of now, keeping a larger picture of Rakhine province's autonomy, the Arakan Army wants to project the Rohingya as their own, but in the past, the organisation is known to have committed deadly atrocities against the community.\n\nHighlighting the events of the region, Sripathi Narayanan, foreign and security policy analyst, said, \"The Rohingya have been used as cannon fodder by both the junta and the rebels. Much of the supplies of the AA (Arakan Army) come from across the western border of Myanmar. The communities across the border also share fraternal ties with one another.\"\n\nIndia's interests\n\nIndia's attitude towards Myanmar has been mixed as it has been facing its own problems in the northeast, particularly in Manipur, for the past 20 months, and the arrival of Christian and Buddhist refugees from Myanmar have further complicated the issues.\n\nThere are fears about advanced weaponry in the hands of Myanmar's rebel groups reaching terrorist groups operating in India's northeastern states. Also, there are reports of Myanmar's rebel groups increasing drug trafficking activities to raise funds, which is another major concern for India.\n\nSensing the risks, the Centre recently tightened the rules for the movement of people from either side of the border in India and Myanmar. The new rules further restrict the movement of people from 16 km under the free movement regime (FMR) to 10 km now, on either side.\n\nA common trait of the ever-altering political scenario of India's neighbourhood - be it Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or Myanmar - is their growing reliance on China. This offers Beijing with chances to further contain India's influence in the Global South as a part of its known strategy.\n\nThe political turmoil in Myanmar and Bangladesh can be used by China to its advantage to foment further internal troubles in the northeastern border states of India.\n\nChina has been engaging with the junta and the rebel groups to derive the maximum protection of its own interests in Myanmar. Beijing has invested billions into the country's oil and gas sector, as well as other physical infrastructure. The Myanmar military controls Kyaukphyu, a major town in Rakhine state that is the terminus of a $1.5 billion oil pipeline and a parallel natural gas pipeline running to Kunming, the capital of the Yunnan province in southwestern China.\n\nThe pipelines are a major part of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, which is an important part of Beijing's ambitious BRI (Belt and Road Initiative).\n\nWith the help of the Arakan Army, China also wants to keep an eye on India's Kaladan project in Rakhine, which is meant to connect the Bay of Bengal with India's northeast. However, the Kaladan project, which entails building new port facilities at Sittwe (Rakhine province capital), a river transit system and a road to India's Mizoram state, seems to be delayed. It would have also reduced India's dependence on Bangladesh for its transit routes. Now, India may have to engage with the Arakan Army, a non-state actor, for starting the delayed project work.\n\nIndia is engaging both with the rebel group and the military government, and has initiated other diplomatic channels.\n\n\"In the past few months, India has started benign engagement with the rebel groups/EAOs (also called Ethnic Armed Organisations) in the regions bordering India because we want to keep our strategic interests of protecting the northeast region at priority,\" says Cchavi Vasisht, senior research associate, Chintan Research Foundation.\n\n\"We need to make further efforts to increase our engagements with AA. To protect our bordering areas as well as the Kaladan project which crosses through the Rakhine state,\" she adds.\n\nAs a way out, there is a need to facilitate dialogue between the rebel groups and junta for initiating an inclusive democratic process where all communities have a say. \"India has been vocalising its concerns with respect to Myanmar, it wants a smooth transition of the country into a federal and democratic setup,\" says Ms Vasisht."

            "article_content": "As investors approach the new year, they dream of profits to come and the risks that might accompany them.\n\nWhen pondering the future, I like to set my expectations by looking to the past, because it offers clues to the rewards, and risks, associated with investing in stocks.\n\nToday I\u2019ll focus on the Canadian stock market, as represented by the S&P/TSX Composite Index, and start with its happier moments, which have predominated over the long term.\n\nThe market index produced average annual total returns of 9.2 per cent from the end of January, 1956, through to the end of November, 2024. The gains aren\u2019t too far off the commonly expected long-term annual growth rate of 10 per cent.\n\nBut the happy 9.2-per-cent annual returns do not, alas, account for inflation, which is the propensity for the purchasing power of the dollar to decline over time. While inflation was modest and largely ignored by investors in recent decades, it resurfaced with a vengeance after the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020.\n\nAdjusting for inflation, the market index gained an average of 5.4 per cent annually from the end of January, 1956, through to the end of November, 2024, which is still mighty fine all things considered. (The returns herein are based on monthly data from Bloomberg and include dividend reinvestment but not fund fees, taxes, commissions or other trading costs. The figures that follow are adjusted for inflation.)\n\nMost people aren\u2019t lucky enough to invest for 70 years, but the market index also produced strong returns over shorter periods that reflect the experience of many investors.\n\nFor instance, the accompanying graph shows the market\u2019s average annual returns over rolling 30-year periods.\n\nYou can see that the market\u2019s annual return rate varied depending on the 30-year period in question. Its lowest inflation-adjusted return rate was 3.3 per cent over the 30 years to the end of January, 1995. Its top rate was 8.4 per cent over the 30 years to the end of October, 2007.\n\nIn happy news, investors enjoyed positive returns over all the rolling 30-year periods shown. Similarly, moving to rolling 20-year periods was also uniformly profitable. But there were a cluster of 10-year rolling periods (that ended in the mid-to-late 1970s and early 1980s) when the average annual return rate was negative.\n\nThe 10-year returns hint at hard times that are highlighted in the second graph, which shows how far the market index fell, from its prior highs, in down periods.\n\nYou can see that investors suffered through a great number of serious declines over the almost 69 years from the end of January, 1956, through to the end of November, 2024.\n\nThe biggest downswings, in chronological order, began with the crash of 1973, which saw the market fall 41 per cent and remain below its former highs for 6.5 years. It was followed by a decline in the early 1980s, which was shorter in duration at 4.4 years but deeper with a plunge of 49 per cent.\n\nIn more recent decades, the market fell 46 per cent in the aftermath of the internet bubble, which reached its apex in the summer of 2000. The market remained below its highs for 5.3 years. It was followed by the financial crisis of 2008-2009, which prompted the market to plunge 43 per cent, but lasted only 3.3 years. Mind you, even a year spent in such a downturn can seem like a century to investors who suffered through it.\n\nOverall, long-term investors should be encouraged by the historical record because buy-and-hold investors gained in the end.\n\nLooking on the bright side, big downturns might come as good news to young investors who are growing their portfolios and are able to buy more shares when prices are good.\n\nOn the other hand, crashes can induce panic among retirees who must draw on their portfolios to sustain themselves. It\u2019s a big reason why it is often suggested that retirees keep their annual withdrawal rates below 4 per cent, subsequently adjusted for inflation. Alas, some retirees might not make it through the biggest downturns with money to spare.\n\nThe historical record helps investors to set their expectations for the market. Mind you, it will eventually serve up even more extreme results and I fear 2025 might be a record breaker given the state of the world.\n\nSo, crack open some bubbly and enjoy the good times while they last, but be sure to save enough to also make it through the bad times to come.\n\nNorman Rothery, PhD, CFA, is the founder of StingyInvestor.com.\n\nBe smart with your money.

            "article_content": "I still can\u2019t quite believe that I\u2019m using an Arm-powered Windows laptop every day. After more than a decade of trying to make Windows on Arm a reality, Microsoft and Qualcomm finally nailed it this year with Copilot Plus PCs. These new laptops have excellent battery life and great performance \u2014 and the app compatibility issues that have plagued Windows on Arm are mostly a thing of the past (as long as you\u2019re not a gamer). Microsoft wanted 2024 to be \u201cthe year of the AI PC,\u201d but I think it was very much the year of Windows on Arm. If 2024 was anything to go by, 2025 is going to be even bigger for Windows on Arm.\n\nMicrosoft set the stage for the 2024 year of Windows on Arm announcements in January at CES with promises of AI PCs and the first big change to Windows keyboards in 30 years. Laptop manufacturers started putting a Copilot key on keyboards early this year, providing quick access to Microsoft\u2019s AI assistant. While the Copilot experience on Windows has gone through several confusing revisions, it\u2019s still a key I accidentally press and then get frustrated when a Copilot window appears.\n\nAfter the Copilot key was met with a lukewarm reception, Microsoft reignited the Mac vs. PC war a few months later. Inside Microsoft, confidence had gradually been growing throughout the early months of 2024 that it could finally beat Apple\u2019s MacBook Air after falling behind for years. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella unveiled the company\u2019s new Copilot Plus PC devices at a special event in May, setting the stage for a summer of Windows on Arm laptops from every major OEM.\n\nThe processor is the key\n\nThe key to Windows on Arm\u2019s revival this year was Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processors, which were announced in April. They\u2019ve provided the type of performance and power efficiency only previously available with Apple\u2019s MacBooks and challenged Intel and AMD to do better in the x86 space. After much debate over Microsoft\u2019s MacBook Air-beating benchmarks, the reviews rolled in and showed that Windows on Arm was indeed capable of matching and beating Apple\u2019s MacBook Air. Qualcomm even hired the \u201cI\u2019m a Mac\u201d guy to promote Windows on Arm PCs, showing how confident it was in challenging Apple\u2019s laptop dominance.\n\nThe Surface Laptop 7 is one of the best Windows laptops available right now. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm also worked closely with developers to make key apps compatible, and it\u2019s now very rare to run into an app compatibility issue that can\u2019t be solved by a native Arm64 version or Microsoft\u2019s improved emulator. Even Google, which previously shunned Windows Phone, has created Arm64 versions of Chrome and Google Drive to support Microsoft\u2019s efforts. With developers continually providing native versions of their apps, it makes it a lot easier to switch to a Windows on Arm laptop. The only big exception is gaming, where x86 still reigns supreme for compatibility and performance.\n\nIntel didn\u2019t sit still while all this Windows on Arm hype was occurring, nor AMD. Intel struck back with Lunar Lake at IFA in September, delivering impressive performance and battery life improvements. AMD\u2019s latest Ryzen AI chips are also competing directly with Qualcomm, and both AMD and Intel have the key advantage of game compatibility that Windows on Arm is definitely not ready for.\n\nWhile we\u2019re still waiting for an M4-powered MacBook Air, Apple did refresh its cheapest MacBooks in October with a surprise upgrade to 16GB of RAM. Apple would probably argue it\u2019s related to Apple Intelligence, but the unusual change came months after Copilot Plus PCs launched, with a minimum of 16GB of RAM at price points that challenge the MacBook Air. Apple did manage to squeeze its new M4 chip into the MacBook Pro recently, though, showing that Qualcomm has some ground to make up in 2025.\n\nApple and Microsoft have both been focusing on AI-powered features for laptops this year, and the end results have been underwhelming on both sides. While a lot of the initial Copilot Plus PC buzz was around Windows on Arm, Microsoft also rolled out some Windows AI features on these devices in June.\n\nIncomplete Recall\n\nThe flagship feature was supposed to be Recall, a feature that snapshots mostly everything you do on a laptop and then lets you recall moments or scroll through a timeline of how you\u2019ve used your PC. But because Recall was met with privacy and security concerns, undermining Microsoft\u2019s entire Copilot Plus PC marketing effort, Microsoft was forced to delay Recall several times to improve its security. In fact, it has only recently appeared in test versions of Windows.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think Microsoft\u2019s stumbles with Recall will mean the company slows down with its Windows AI efforts. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri recently told me that the very future of Windows is about cloud and AI, so expect a lot more of this in 2025.\n\nMicrosoft is increasingly focusing on Windows AI features like Recall. Image: Microsoft\n\nComing in 2025\n\nNext year will also be a fascinating battle between x86 and Windows on Arm. AMD and Intel are teaming up to fend off Arm-based chips from Qualcomm, and Intel is facing a period of turbulence after ejecting its CEO, facing desktop chip issues, and a wave of layoffs earlier this year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to see 2025 as the year that Windows on Arm continues to eat into the laptop space. A Dell leak revealed Qualcomm is preparing new chips for 2025, and the chip maker has also been rolling out cheaper Arm-based chips to bring laptop prices down. I\u2019d expect we\u2019ll see more of those at CES in January, alongside the usual slew of laptops that set the stage for the year.\n\nThe Dell leak also hinted at Nvidia\u2019s next-gen GPU plans, which now look set for a CES announcement. Leaks suggest we\u2019ll see RTX 50-series desktop GPUs and even the laptop variants, with OEMs rumored to be preparing new models to show at CES. Given the Windows on Arm gaming situation, a new generation of Nvidia\u2019s GPUs could help generate fresh excitement around x86 laptops throughout 2025.\n\nNvidia might also be planning to help the Windows on Arm effort. The chip maker has long been rumored to be planning to launch Arm PC chips as soon as 2025. Nvidia\u2019s expertise in AI chips and gaming could certainly shake up the Windows laptop world and make Windows on Arm even more enticing."

And there are some things that we'd probably be better off not knowing about.\n\nCase in point, a 400ft-deep hole in the sea.\n\nWith most of the world's oceans being unexplored by humans, it's no wonder it gives some of us the heebie-jeebies.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is located 60 miles off the coast of Belize.\n\nThe rim rises up out of the Caribbean Sea, so it's not hard to miss either.\n\nThis hole was made famous by French explorer and naval officer Jacques Cousteau.\n\nCousteau was a groundbreaker in the field of oceanography, being the co-inventor of the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA). He also produced some of the world's first underwater documentaries and wrote books on his incredible findings.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe Great Blue Hole is approximately 60 miles from Belize (Schafer & Hill/Getty)\n\nCousteau's grandson Fabien would continue his grandfather's legacy by journeying down the giant hole in 2018.\n\nHe made this journey alongside Richard Branson, travelling in two submarines.\n\nAs you might imagine, a 400ft pit isn't the most welcoming and hospitable place. At around 300ft, they discovered a layer of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nAdvert\n\nBelow that point, the water was dark and devoid of life. But there was more to come.\n\nWhen the explorers finally made it to the bottom, they made a disturbing discovery.\n\nThere was some rubbish lying on the ground, including a two-litre plastic bottle, as well as a long-lost GoPro.\n\nThe GoPro contained some shots from a holiday. Usually seeing someone's vacation snaps would be enough to inspire envy, but in this situation, it'd be enough to send a shiver down your spine.\n\nAdvert\n\nHowever, that's nothing compared to the two bodies also sitting down there.\n\nThey made a disturbing discovery (VW Pics/Contributor/Getty)\n\nThese were explorers who had gone missing on a previous expedition.\n\nWhile the living explorers determined it'd be best to leave the corpses put, they did inform the Belize government. The hole was also filled with a series of caves, filled with hanging stalactites - mineral formations found on the ceilings of caves.\n\nAdvert\n\nVisualise a stone icicle and you'll have a clearer idea of what they look like.\n\nAt any rate, they form in caves above water level so seeing them down below was rather unusual.\n\nThis indicated that this hole had once been on dry land.\n\nWriting on the Virgin website, Branson reflected: \"The Blue Hole is made of a complex system of caves that once formed on dry land. It is proof of how oceans can rise quickly and catastrophically.\n\n\"Sea levels were once hundreds of feet lower. 10,000 years ago the sea level rose by about 300 feet when a lot of ice melted around the world. At 300 feet down you could see the change in the rock where it used to be land and turned into sea.\"\n\nHe said it was 'one of the starkest reminders of the danger of climate change [he's] ever seen'."

            "article_content": "As the year draws to a close, China has set its sights firmly on the future, with a roadmap laid out during the recently concluded annual Central Economic Work Conference. The focus is clear \u2014 scientific and technological innovation will be the cornerstone of the nation's economic strategy heading into 2025.\n\nThe goal is nothing short of transformative \u2014 to create new quality productive forces and overhaul China's industrial system, building a framework for a modernized, tech-driven economy.\n\nAs a journalist, I find it fascinating to see how the country is positioning itself at the forefront of the next industrial revolution.\n\nWith major technological projects and large-scale demonstrations of new technologies, China is laying the groundwork for fostering new quality productive forces. This initiative, which centers around emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things, promises to dramatically reshape industries across the board.\n\nThe government is keen to foster innovation in emerging sectors, nurturing the industries of the future while ensuring that China maintains its competitive edge in strategic technological areas.\n\nYu Hongjun, former vice-minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, explained that China's push into digital infrastructure is already paying off.\n\nOver the past few years, the country has made major strides in establishing a robust digital economy.\n\nThe widespread adoption of 5G and the development of 6G satellite communication systems have set the stage for what Yu calls a smart, connected economy.\n\nHe said during the World Internet of Things Convention held recently in Beijing that the rise of new IoT, new data and new business models are quietly but powerfully reshaping China's economic landscape. This is the bedrock of the new quality productive forces the country is betting on for long-term success.\n\nAs I dug deeper into the details, I realized the scale of what's unfolding here.\n\nHe Xuming, chairman of the World Internet of Things Convention Executive Committee, said the global digital economy, driven by IoT technologies, is growing at an annual rate of 20 percent. This year, global IoT connections are expected to increase by more than 23 percent to surpass 25 billion.\n\nWhat's even more impressive is that China is leading the charge in IoT infrastructure construction and innovative development in the digital economy.\n\nChina is poised to build over 4.3 million 5G base stations this year, helping to connect over 3 billion IoT devices, said He, adding that the traditional digital economy in China is projected to reach an annual output value of over 70 trillion yuan ($9.59 trillion), growing at a rate of more than 20 percent. With nearly a million companies already operating in the IoT space, the groundwork for China to lead in new quality productive forces is well underway.\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing aspect of this push is its potential to trigger the fourth industrial revolution. Wei Jianguo, former vice-minister of commerce, said the core of this revolution is the convergence of digital technologies with manufacturing processes. The digitalization of industry, Wei argues, will redefine global production systems, and China, with its advanced manufacturing supply chains and digital leadership, is uniquely positioned to spearhead this transformation.\n\nWei further emphasized that the fourth industrial revolution will not only drive economic growth, but also profoundly impact China's social structure, economic models, and the relationship between humans and nature.\n\nAs I reflect on these developments, it's clear that the shift toward new quality productive forces, driven by AI, IoT and other next-generation technologies, will inevitably position China as a global innovation powerhouse.\n\nThe government's proactive approach to fostering these changes is strategic, forward-thinking and deeply embedded in its broader economic goals for the next few years.\n\nThe story unfolding here isn't just about economic growth \u2014 it's about reshaping the very fabric of industry and society in ways we're only just beginning to comprehend.\n\nAs 2025 approaches, all eyes will be on China to see how it executes this ambitious plan and whether it can truly lead the world into the next industrial revolution."
