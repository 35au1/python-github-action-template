            "article_content": "Leroy Chiao, a seasoned former NASA astronaut, has added a compelling account to the growing list of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) sightings in the United States.\n\nWhile flying his private plane over Texas in August 2024, Chiao claims to have witnessed two metallic orbs whizzing past at close range, an encounter that has left him and others pondering the origins and implications of these mysterious objects.\n\nChiao was flying at an altitude of 9,000 feet, en route from Colorado to Houston, when the incident occurred. The orbs, described as spherical and roughly three feet in diameter, zipped by his aircraft at an estimated distance of only 20 feet.\n\n\"It could've been a bad result if they had actually hit me,\" Chiao told NewsNation. \"It happened so quick, there wasn't even a chance to get scared.\"\n\nDespite their proximity, the objects were not detected on radar or by the FAA-required transponders visible on Chiao's cockpit display. Air traffic control did not alert him to any nearby aircraft, adding to the enigma.\n\n\"I don't know what it was,\" Chiao admitted, describing the sighting as both \"mysterious\" and \"disconcerting.\"\n\nGovernment transparency and the drone mystery\n\nChiao's encounter comes amid a surge of drone and UFO sightings across the United States, many near sensitive military installations and urban centers. These incidents have sparked widespread concern and speculation about their origins, with theories ranging from foreign espionage to top-secret military programs to extraterrestrial activity.\n\nChiao leans toward the explanation that the orbs may be advanced military drones, but he remains cautious.\n\n\"At first blush, to me, it seems like some kind of a military program, our military,\" he said. \"And if it's not that, then it gets a little more scary.\"\n\nIn the past month, reports of drone and UFO activity have increased dramatically, particularly in the northeastern United States. New Jersey, for example, has seen a flurry of sightings, including reports of SUV-sized drones hovering near residential areas.\n\nBelleville Mayor Michael Melham, a vocal critic of the federal government's handling of the issue, recently expressed frustration after attending a \"mayors-only\" briefing on the topic.\n\n\"The mayors are livid,\" journalist Michael Shellenberger reported, citing one mayor's account of automobile-sized drones hovering near his home."

            "article_content": "Google launched the first Gemini model in December 2023 when its chatbot was still named Bard. Since then, the search giant has gradually adopted the name Gemini for almost everything it does related to AI.\n\nThe Bard chatbot was the first to fall, becoming simply Gemini earlier this year. This was soon followed by the Gemini Assistant largely replacing the previous assistant on Android. The company also uses Gemini in Docs and for developers.\n\nAfter the initial flurry of activity things seemed to slow down for Google. Rather than a new name, as they'd done previously, the company doubled down on Gemini, adding it to ever more products and services.\n\nThen, in December Google released Gemini 2.0. CEO Sundar Pichai described its release as the start of the Agent Era. This is where AI models perform tasks on your behalf based on an initial set of instructions.\n\nWhat is Gemini?\n\nIntroducing Gemini 2.0 | Our most capable AI model yet - YouTube Watch On\n\nThe Gemini model has been trained not just on text, but as a multimodal model which can process images, video, audio and even computer code. This is similar to OpenAI's GPT-4o and as of Gemini 2 it can also output those modalities.\n\nIn line with Google\u2019s typical mode of operation, the latest version of the model has been quietly developed over the past months and offers some features that more hyped products like ChatGPT have overlooked.\n\nFor example, there are now over 50,000 variations of Gemini on Hugging Face, covering a multitude of languages and uses.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

The latest flurry of Gemini launches has made things even worse, and so we thought it was time to lay out a clear map of the Gemini universe to make things easier to understand.\n\nThe first thing to realize is Google likes to mix and match model technology and applications, with variations of the same name. Once you get that clear, everything else starts to slot into place.\n\n1. Models\n\n(Image credit: Google)\n\nIn the beginning was DeepMind, the AI lab launched in London in 2010. This foundation stone of the whole AI industry delivered the LaMDA, PaLM, and Gato AI models to the world. Gemini is the latest iteration of this generational family.\n\nVersion 1.0 of the Gemini model was launched in three flavors, Ultra, Pro and Nano. As the names suggest, the models ranged from high power down to petite versions designed to run on phones and other small devices.\n\nNote that much of the confusion from the subsequent launches has come about because of Google's philosophical tussle between its search and AI businesses.\n\nAI cannibalism of search has always been a sword hanging above the company\u2019s head, and has contributed mightily to its \u2018will they, won\u2019t they\u2019 attitude towards releasing AI products.\n\n(Image credit: Google)\n\nGemini 1.5, released ten months ago, was an incremental improvement of the original model, incorporating mixture of experts (MoE) tech, a one million token context window and new architecture. Since that time we\u2019ve seen the launch of Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro-002 and Gemini 1.5 Flash-002 - the latter released just three months ago.\n\nAt the same time the company also made a surprising foray into open model territory, with the launch of the free Gemma product. These 2B and 7B parameter models were seen as a direct response to Meta\u2019s release of the Llama model family. Gemma 2.0 was released five months later.\n\nGemini 2.0 launched in December 2024, and is billed as a model for the agentic era. The first version to be released was Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, a high performance multimodal model, which supports tool use like Google search, and function calling for code generation.\n\nWithin weeks the company launched Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced, apparently the full version of the current generation. We say apparently because at this point in time nobody\u2019s really sure what\u2019s full and what\u2019s early code.\n\nWhat can be said with certainty is that Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental is an extremely capable and performant AI model all round.\n\nGemini models\n\nGemini 1 Ultra - powerful\n\nGemini 1 Pro - mid-range\n\nGemini 1 Nano \u2013 small\n\nGemini 1.5 Flash \u2013 fast, cheaper\n\nGemini 1.5 Pro \u2013 slower, more expensive\n\nGemini 2.0 Flash Experimental\n\nGemini 2.0 Flash Thinking\n\nGemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced\n\nGemma models ( Gemmaverse)\n\nGemma 1 (2B, 7B parameters)\n\nGemma 2 (2B, 9B, 27B): 27B trained from scratch.\n\nCodeGemma (2B and 7B): fine-tuned for code generation.\n\nRecurrentGemma (2B, 9B): Griffin-based, instead of Transformer-based.\n\nPaliGemma 2 (3B, 10B, 28B): vision model accepts text and image inputs. Multilingual.\n\nDataGemma: data focused model\n\nGemmaScope: AI research tool\n\n2. Applications\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nGoogle is both a research and a product company. DeepMind and Google AI lead the research and release the models. The other side of Google takes those models and puts them into products. This includes hardware, software and services.\n\nChatbots\n\nChatbots lead the charge in terms of Google applications, as they do for so many other foundation model suppliers. Again, this being Google, things get a little bit fuzzy in terms of names and functions.\n\nGemini chatbot. This used to be called Bard, and is completely separate to the Gemini model. Ten months ago Bard and Duet AI, another Google product, were merged together under the Gemini brand with the launch of an Android app.\n\nSubsequent to that action, Gemini chat has now been integrated into more Google products, including Android Assistant, the Chrome browser, Google Photos and Google Workspace.\n\nAt the time of writing the Gemini Chatbot and legacy Android Assistant are offered as dual options on the latest versions of the Android phone operating system. Gemini Live is seen as the Google alternative to OpenAI\u2019s low latency, high speed Advanced Voice Mode, and is expected to roll out across Google Pixel smartphones in the near future.\n\nProducts\n\nWhile Gemini as a chatbot might get most of the new models and attention from AI aficionados, most of the eyes on AI will be going to Gemini on mobile.\n\nThis comes in two forms, first through the Gemini App on iPhone and Android, and then through its deep integration into the Android operating system.\n\nOn Android developers can even use the Gemini Nano model in their own apps without having to use a cloud-based, or costly model to perform basic tasks.\n\nThe deep integration allows for system functions to be triggered from Gemini, as well as the use of Gemini Live \u2014 the AI voice assistant \u2014 to play songs and more.\n\nExperiments\n\nThe latest Gemini model launch has been accompanied by a series of major Google application releases or previews tied into the new model. The list is long and impressive. Some of them include:\n\nProject Astra: spectacular demonstration of the power of visual understanding for AI assistants\n\nProject Mariner: a great showcase of the power of multimodal AI for real world use cases\n\nNotebookLM: a stunning new paradigm for research and study applications\n\nDeep Research: hugely powerful agentic research tool with deep search ability and huge contexts\n\n3. Platforms\n\n(Image credit: Shutterstock)\n\nOutside of the mobile and web-based versions of Gemini there are some premium and developer focused products. These usually offer the most advanced models and features such as Deep Research in Gemini Advanced."

ADB appointed me as a staff consultant without waiting for the mandatory \u2018cooling off\u2019 12-month period expired. A memo signed by the President, a Vice President, and two Directors Generals of ADB stated why I should be re-recruited immediately. It stated, \u201cMr. Perera\u2019s experience as a senior and highly respected member of ADB as a safeguard specialist makes him ideal for this position \u2026 He is a well-respected ADB staff and was one of ADB\u2019s leading experts in the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people\u2019s development issues; he was the only international staff member at ADB who had technical knowledge and expertise in all three safeguard areas\u2026\u2026..\u201d\n\nOne of my major assignments as a consultant was to conduct training in 10 Pacific countries for senior government officials on how to address social and environmental issues to meet ADB\u2019s safeguard policy standards. Fiji, Samoa, Pohnpei, Tonga, Cook Islands and Marshall Islands were among the countries chosen. Each country offered its rich culture, natural beauty, and the opportunity to meet people with vivid personalities and experience paranormal encounters. Pohnpei, an island state in the Pacific, etched a dazzling world I will never forget.\n\nPohnpei and three island states form the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in the western Pacific Ocean. Pohnpei is the largest island in FSM, with a land area of 335 sq. kilometres. The other three states are Yap, Chuuk, and Kosrae. Pohnpei State also owns several small islands in the vast Pacific Ocean.\n\nPohnpei means \u2018stone altar.\u2019 Presumably, it refers to a large stone platform on the island. The island\u2019s population is about 37,000. Its terrain is mountainous and jungle-covered. It is one of the wettest places on Earth, with an annual rainfall exceeding 7,600 mm. A circular, tarred, narrow road connects dispersed towns. Access to the interior, especially to hilly areas, is challenging.\n\nThe people are proud of their history and boast about Nan Madol, an ancient city-kingdom. Its civilisation flourished for 700 years, from the 10th century to the 17th century. Its downfall began with the arrival of Spanish sailors in the early 19th century, followed by whalers, traders, missionaries, educators, and colonisers. After the Spaniards, the Germans occupied it. During the Second World War, the Japanese captured it, and the USA took it from the Japanese in the late 1940s.\n\nLocals suffered severely when colonisers plundered their treasures and destroyed cultural artefacts. Spaniards brought cholera and smallpox to Pohnpei, nearly annihilating the local population. The Japanese not only looted local treasures but also enslaved people. During the Second World War, Japanese warlords used local slaves to move heavy cannons to strategic mountaintops. Most of the workers died because of starvation and illnesses.\n\nIn 1986, Pohnpei became an independent state within FSM. The five traditional small kingdoms on the island constitute independent Pohnpei, and the Pohnpei State Council represents them. Kolonia is the capital of Pohnpei State, and Palikir is the capital of FSM. The two cities are adjacent to each other. The local kingdoms occasionally clash with the State Council on matters of development. About 10 years ago, for example, the State Council tried establishing a casino complex in the territory of a traditional kingdom. Its king opposed the proposal and took his protest to an international forum for arbitration.\n\nEnglish is the official language, and people consider themselves non-immigrant citizens of the United States. In other words, the USA guarantees they can become US citizens whenever they want. The currency in the country is the US dollar. Postage is paid in US$, and postal stamps are US postal stamps. A taxi charges one dollar to travel within Kolonia.\n\nFortunately, I got a seat on United Airlines from Honolulu to Kolonia. The Filipino hotel manager told me to wait a few hours before occupying my room. When I asked him why, he said hotel guests who had left in the morning might return if their flight was cancelled. The hotel\u2019s policy is to accommodate such stranded travellers on a priority basis in the rooms they had occupied earlier.\n\nI was tired, hungry, and sleepy. The manager gave me a hot tuna sandwich and coffee at the restaurant. He told me he could give me a room with a door facing the jungle behind the hotel. I feared small insects and reptiles might creep into my room after sunset. The incessant rain added a gloomy atmosphere to my fear. I could hear water gushing down a drain. Rainwater trickled down from the eves of the roof, flooding the narrow corridor in front of the room and making it slippery.\n\nI moved into the room and slept several hours. When I woke up, it was dark and still raining. I did not know how to go to the restaurant. There was no telephone in my room. I was nervous about going to the bathroom. When I opened the tap in the bathroom, it took about five minutes to see clear water. I was reluctant to pull the shower curtain. When I pulled it, a six-legged, black, long, gecko-like creature was in the bathtub. The bathtub was cracked and dirty and covered with dead leaves. The room\u2019s light bulb was weak, and the bathroom was not lit up to see what else was waiting there to meet me. I regretted my decision to occupy an outer room.\n\nThe manager came to take me to dinner. He had a strong flashlight and a large umbrella. I asked him about possibly moving to a room inside the hotel. But by then, the hotel was fully occupied. The manager told a Filipina woman to clean my room again and to keep a heater in it. I insisted that the bedsheets and pillows should also be changed. When I returned to my room after supper, it looked neat and smelled good. The gecko-like creatures had disappeared.\n\nI had a free weekend in Pohnpei before leaving for Honolulu. The hotel manager suggested I hire his four-wheel drive Jeep and travel around the island. He charged me $100 for the trip, which included a driver-cum-guide, a lunch box, snacks, and soft drinks. He advised me to carry one-dollar bills with me to pay local taxes. I changed a 50-dollar note for one-dollar and five-dollar bills. The bills were dirty and discoloured; some were as hard as cardboard.\n\nThe Jeep was a rickety old van without a spare wheel. It spluttered dark, unburned diesel, and its engine noise was unbearable. Roger, the jeep driver, was a local young man with long hair and a ferocious-looking black beard. He carried a big, heavy knife. The hotel manager handed him food boxes and an umbrella.\n\nI thought Roger might sacrifice me to a native god by cutting my neck at a remote place. I had read on Google about human sacrifices to gods on the island. I wished I had invited another hotel guest to accompany me, but it was too late. Roger promised to show me places that foreign visitors rarely visit. His offer made me more nervous. I told him that I should return to the hotel before 5 p.m.\n\nRoger drove the old Jeep with care. He stopped the Jeep in front of churches to talk to his friends who came for the Sunday mass. Sometimes, he offered them a ride in the Jeep without asking me. At a church, at least 10 people entered the Jeep, and two sat next to me in the front seat, pushing me onto the gear shift. They were fat people dressed in large white shirts and baggy blue jeans. They had unshaven faces and unwashed mouths. They spoke English. They invited me to visit their church and to join them for a communal lunch. I politely declined the offer by saying I was on a tight travel programme and should return to Kolonia early.\n\nLater, I visited a small Christian church. The church had a neat front yard, and a local artist had painted beautiful murals of the genesis and the crucifixion. I could see some well-thumbed prayer books and hymn books on a small table covered with an embroidered white tablecloth. The small board on the table invited donations. One could donate money by dropping dollar bills or cents into a small glass box, which a small padlock secured.\n\nSeveral people were in the church, wearing their Sunday best. Men wore European clothes, and women wore long white dresses with beautiful shoes. Some of them had heavy makeup. All adult women wore head covers. Many devotees, especially the women, carried rosaries in their hands.\n\nPeople sat in circles by the road and ate from large metal pots. Roger explained that Christians do not work on Sundays except for attending mid-morning service. They cook on Saturday and partook of it on Sunday after the church service. Pork was the main dish. Raw tuna fish competed with fried pork to be the best food item. Someone told me they had learned how to raise pigs and cook pork dishes from Filipino friends whose ancestors came with the Spaniards as cooks and servants.\n\nSuddenly, Roger drove off the main road, saying he wanted to show me the statue of Henry Nanpie. The figure was about 100 metres from a protestant church and was on an elevated stone dais. I thought it was built of steel with a hollow interior. Henry was in an elite tailcoat with a walking stick in his right hand. Roger told me that Henry had lived in Pohnpei in the late 19th century and early 20th century. He was the son of a local army commander. His mother was an English woman \u2013 the daughter of an English beachcomber.\n\nHenry inherited lots of land from his powerful father. Then, he wanted to acquire land from another local kingdom. Henry visited the kingdom\u2019s palace carrying a loaded gun and a bag of goodies. He took the weapon to kill the king and the goodies to bribe palace servants to get their allegiance. When he saw the king in an inner palace chamber, he tried to kill the king. But his gun misfired. Then Henry aimed the weapon at a flowerpot and pulled the trigger. The bullet went through the flowerpot and damaged the wall behind it.\n\nHenry cunningly claimed that he had supernatural powers and could stop a gun from firing a bullet. He explained to the king that before he aimed the weapon at the king, he had \u201ccharmed\u201d the gun. Because of the charm, the gun misfired. After removing the charm from the gun, a bullet fired from it smashed the flowerpot. The king was amazed and convinced himself of Henry\u2019s supernatural powers. The king asked him to be the kingdom\u2019s protector offering him a mansion and a vast stretch of land.\n\nHenry opened a large supply shop to supply food, water, oil, and labour to whaling ships in the Pacific. He used his new wealth to add more land to his estate. In Pohnpei, he established protestant groups and spread Western cultural practices and beliefs among the locals through them. Even today, local people consider him a semi-god who brought wealth and salvation to them and connected them with the outside world. Roger sang a folk song about Henry, which depicted Henry as a local god. A copper plaque beside his statue indicates that he still has admirers to spread, invent and reinvent myths about him.\n\nRoger was hurrying me to go to the ruined capital of Nan Madol Kingdom. He told me that the kingdom was on the banks of a large lagoon connected to the eastern shoreline. It was the only ancient city ever built atop a coral reef. In 2016, the UN declared it a World Heritage Site. We drove on a narrow gravel road and parked the Jeep. From there, we walked about two kilometres to Nan Madol. We walked through private lands, and landowners charged a fee for crossing their land. Some landlords collected a dollar or two, but one landlord demanded seven dollars.\n\nWe entered a rocky trail from the last property. The land rapidly became marshy, and we walked on an elevated narrow bund. Both sides of the bund were inundated, and walking on it was risky. Henry dexterously cut down weeds and plants that obstructed the path. He wanted me to follow him closely but did not say why. The thought that he might sacrifice me to a local god began looming in my mind. I did not look around as I wanted to keep my eyes on him and the bund. He walked fast, brandishing his knife as if in a frenzy.\n\nThe narrow bund that stretched through a grotesque jungle of mangroves looked never-ending. I thought that spirits were watching and following me. I tried to avoid looking at large trees because I thought they were beckoning me. Some tree trunks, I thought, turned into hobgoblins. I remembered reading how funny elves resort to mischievous acts towards human beings who encroach on their territories.\n\nSuddenly, I felt some invisible force pulling me back. I could not see Roger. I thought that I got lost among the mangroves forever. I saw the shallow water in marshy fields swelling to engulf me. I stopped walking. I thought how silly I was to think about bizarre things. Then Roger returned and asked me whether I had seen anything or anybody. I told him that some trees had tried to talk to me and were making faces at me. He said that many visitors had similar supernatural encounters. Roger explained that Pohnpiens treated the ruins at Nan Madol as sacred. They also knew various spirits haunt the place. The spirits came out at night, but a few hovered around during the daytime to harass visitors. Roger gave me several small, polished stones connected in a string. It reminded me of the rosaries that churchgoers had in their hands. He said that the string would fend off evil spirits. I then remembered my grandmother, who gave me my first rosary when I was seven, advising me to carry it with me to protect myself from evil forces.\n\nWe arrived at a stagnant shallow canal from where we could see the temple entrance. To reach the temple, we crossed a shallow canal. There were several decayed logs in the canal, and we had to push them aside to cross it. About 50 metres from the canal were the elegant stone walls three to five metres high. Just under a stone arch was a conduit from a table-flat wall top where, presumably, human sacrifices were conducted. According to Roger, the blood of those victims trickled down from the wall top to the main entrance through the conduit, where priests performed rituals to appease gods. Many city outer walls remain intact, although mangroves have engulfed them.\n\nLocal people believe twin brothers, who were sorcerers, built Nan Madol. They came to Pohnpei from another island in a large canoe to build an altar where they could perform ancestor worship. The legend is that the two brothers levitated large stones with the help of a flying dragon and built the entire city in three years. They transported basalt columns from a faraway island. Most of the columns are now under shallow water in the lagoon.\n\nThe temple consists of about 90 rectangular islets linked by narrow channels. Each islet had a coral-filled platform. Nan Madol means \u201cwithin the intervals,\u201d and the \u201cintervals\u201d are the complex canal grid. It is unclear who lived on islets, but locals believe priests who performed rituals at the altar lived in single-house units built on islets.\n\nThere were reserved locations among the islets for priests to feed turtle innards to a sacred eel who lived in a deep well. After feeding the eel, priests shared the rest of the turtle as a sacrament. To this day, eels are considered holy and are never killed or eaten.\n\nThe main enclosure is a large stone chamber with hundreds of human bones. About 15 years ago, several German archaeologists dusted and rearranged the bones to examine their age. That night, one archaeologist died in his hotel room in Kolonia, and the other fell gravely ill. Roger said his ancestors were unhappy when foreigners excavated and labelled their bones. They, as spirits, protect the monuments and punish anyone who disturbs them.\n\nRoger\u2019s father and two uncles had seen several light beams starting from the temple\u2019s main altar late one night. The light beams travelled across the sea to faraway islands and large stars. When I asked Roger if he would camp at Nan Madol after sunset to watch the light beams, he said he would not risk meeting his ancestors! He advised me not to talk about them as they were holy spirits with enormous powers and could harm us in their domain.\n\nWe spent two hours walking around the temple. The shallow sea and the lagoon behind the ruins were very picturesque. We tried to count the heaps of basalt rafts submerged in the lagoon. When we decided to leave Nan Madol, I felt I could not move. I was unsure whether the feeling came from my fear of hobgoblins or the perplexity in my mind. I told Roger to walk with me to the Jeep. He walked ahead of me, occasionally checking whether I was following him. I tried to walk fast without looking at the trees I had seen earlier. I felt a powerful, unseen force pulling me backwards. I imagined a tree with strange roots moving towards me. The gushing winds created a bizarre atmosphere. I felt I had not left the ruins, so I called Roger and asked him to walk with me. We plodded to the Jeep from the ruins. He reassured me that the spirits would not follow us. I was glad to leave Phonpei the following day."

            "article_content": "Despite Max\u2019s pivot to purging films and TV shows from its programming library, the platform still has plenty of excellent new releases to check out during this year\u2019s holiday season. Whether you\u2019re into live-action dramas, sci-fi spectacles, or animated epics, the streamer has a little bit of everything to offer. Naturally, we\u2019ve put together a handy list of some of our favorites we think you might get a kick out of.\n\nThe Penguin\n\nIt sounded like Warner Bros. and DC were having a laugh when they started referring to The Penguin\u2019s central mobster as \u201cOz Cobb,\u201d as if that has ever been that character\u2019s name. It also seemed odd that the studios were bullish about airing a series spun off from Matt Reeves\u2019 The Batman when all signs have suggested that those characters won\u2019t make it into James Gunn\u2019s new universe of DC films. Somehow, though, The Penguin proved to be a surprisingly compelling return to Gotham as it explored the inner workings of Oz Cobb\u2019s (Colin Farrell) mind and reframed him as a twisted underdog fighting to keep up with fellow crimelord Sofia Gigante (Cristin Milioti).\n\nBy largely removing Batman from the equation, The Penguin was able to present its murderous gangsters as people (rather than costumed weirdos) who were really just trying to get by in a city that was all too ready to throw them away. And by the show\u2019s season 1 finale, The Penguin establishes itself as one of the better Batman stories that DC has produced in recent years \u2014 one that definitely deserves a second chapter.\n\nInvincible Fight Girl\n\nThere\u2019s nothing fun about getting punched in the face, but in Invincible Fight Girl\u2019s world, where everyone is a superpowered professional wrestler, it\u2019s the kind of thing that lights a fire within young brawler Andy \u200b\u200b(Sydney Mikayla). Even though her parents would rather she live a quiet life of accounting, Andy knows in her heart that she\u2019s a born wrestler who just needs a trainer who can bring out her inner greatness. And while Quesa Poblana (Rolonda Watts) is none too pleased about the idea of taking on a newbie mentee, she, too, can see that Andy has what it takes to become a legend.\n\nThe way Invincible Fight Girl borrows elements of classic shonen shows like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, Pok\u00e9mon, and Hajime no Ippo feels like it could almost be too much at first. But the show blends its influences together brilliantly to tell its own unique story and create fight sequences that are cool as hell.\n\nLike Water for Chocolate\n\nBy easing up on the magical realism of Laura Esquivel\u2019s novel, Francisco Javier Royo Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s new adaptation of Like Water for Chocolate makes it somewhat easier to appreciate the depth of its central love story set during the Mexican Revolution.\n\nThere is still something otherworldly about Tita de la Garza\u2019s (Azul Guaita) ability to channel her emotions into the food she cooks. Tita\u2019s sisters Rosaura (Ana Valeria Becerril) and Gertrudis (Andrea Chaparro) and her forbidden love Pedro Muzquiz (Andr\u00e9s Baida) can attest to the way her culinary creations leave people overwhelmed as they experience whatever feelings were roiling inside of her. But that detail is really just one small ingredient the new Like Water for Chocolate adaptation uses to enhance its rumination on the ways that class conflict and war have shaped the arc of Tita\u2019s life.\n\nDune: Prophecy\n\nIn Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Dune films, the Bene Gesserit order is so shrouded in mystery that it\u2019s hard to tell whether their strange abilities are rooted in the supernatural. But Dune: Prophecy dives into the Sisterhood\u2019s ancient history to unpack the many ways in which secret science rather than sorcery is what turned them into one of the most influential forces in the entire spice-addicted Imperium.\n\nThe show\u2019s exploration of how Valya (Emily Watson / Jessica Barden) and Tula (Olivia Williams / Emma Canning) Harkonnen reestablished their family as one of the galaxy\u2019s Great Houses adds new depth to the Dune franchise\u2019s larger story about the rise of a long-awaited messiah. Through the Harkonnen sisters, Prophecy demystifies some of the legend of the Kwisatz Haderach and reveals how ruthless the fight to control spice has always been. And it makes for an excellent way to get your sandworm fix while we wait for the next Dune feature to premiere.\n\nCreature Commandos\n\nThough James Gunn and Peter Safran are mostly starting over fresh for Warner Bros.\u2019 new cinematic universe of DC films, a tiny portion of the old DCEU is being reborn through the animated Creature Commandos series. After the events of The Suicide Squad and season 1 of Peacemaker, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) can no longer force teams of superhumans to covertly do her bidding under threat of death. But there are no laws forbidding her from recruiting a squad of supernatural monsters like Nina Mazursky (Zo\u00eb Chao), Eric Frankenstein (David Harbour), the Bride (Indira Varma), and Circe (Anya Chalotra) to go on suicidal missions that Waller would rather the public not know about.\n\nPart of what\u2019s intriguing about the show is the way characters like Waller, Weasel (Sean Gunn, who will also voice G.I. Robot), and Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo) will establish a narrative continuity between DC\u2019s old films and many of its upcoming live-action projects. And with Gunn going all in on actors reprising their roles across different mediums, Creature Commandos seems like it might be the start of an era worth tuning in to.\n\nCivil War\n\nThough there\u2019s a certain degree of absurdity to the political details of Alex Garland\u2019s Civil War, its depiction of the United States descending into chaos after a tyrannical president refuses to leave office feels like a haunting vision of a future that isn\u2019t as improbable as we\u2019d hope. As a respected war reporter, Lee Smith (Kirsten Dunst) feels she has a duty to document the reality of what has become of her country in the time since the president (Nick Offerman) came into power.\n\nLee\u2019s years of reporting from the front lines of conflicts all over the world have taught her how important it is for people to be able to see how war ruins lives and pushes societies to (if not over) the brink of collapse. But as Lee sets out to secure the interview of a lifetime, she quickly realizes that no amount of reporting has prepared her to see war unfolding in the place she calls home. And with rookie journalist Jessie (Cailee Spaeny) by her side, the only thing that keeps Lee grounded is her hope that she can pass her skills on to the next generation.\n\nI Saw the TV Glow\n\nOne doesn\u2019t need to be queer or a Buffy fan to appreciate the neon-drenched strangeness of Jane Schoenbrun\u2019s I Saw the TV Glow. But the movie\u2019s story about two lonely teens bonding over a cheesy sci-fi show might hit differently for anyone who grew up in the \u201990s feeling like they would be more at home in Sunnydale than living their own humdrum lives.\n\nEven though young outcasts Owen (Justice Smith / Ian Foreman) and Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine) don\u2019t initially have the words to articulate what it is that makes them different from other kids, there\u2019s something about The Pink Opaque that speaks to them both. The teens don\u2019t understand why they feel such a powerful, instinctive kinship to the TV show\u2019s monster-fighting heroines or how the program is influencing the way they see the world. But by the time they\u2019ve both grown up a bit, they can\u2019t shake the feeling that The Pink Opaque has changed something within them \u2014 something that might mean everything they\u2019ve been raised to believe is a lie.\n\nTrap\n\nIn any other M. Night Shyamalan movie, you would expect the big twist to come closer toward the end in order to leave audiences reeling, but Trap does something much more intriguing with its story about the cops tracking down a famous serial killer. Family man Cooper (Josh Hartnett) prides himself on the way he\u2019s able to keep his double life secret from his loved ones. His daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) and wife Rachel (Alison Pill) have no idea that he has other houses than the one they live in. And they would never guess that he spends much of his free time watching a livestream feed of a man he has tied up in a secret basement.\n\nCooper seems like exactly the sort of Good Guy\u2122 who would surprise his daughter with a trip to see her favorite singer Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan) in concert because that\u2019s what he wants people to see. But what Cooper doesn\u2019t realize is that the concert is an elaborate trap and the centerpiece of one of Shyamalan\u2019s most fun thrillers yet.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\n\nThere are only a few choice scenes in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice that achieve the kind of horror-comedy brilliance that made Tim Burton\u2019s original 1988 film such a batshit revelation. Those fleeting moments and a pitch-perfect performance from Michael Keaton just manage to make the sequel feel like a film that has something to offer fans beyond nostalgia for the Deetz family and their favorite incorporeal dirtbag.\n\nYears after Lydia Deetz\u2019s (Winona Ryder) first encounter with Beetlejuice (Keaton), she has become the host of a paranormal television show and mother to a sullen teenager of her own. Though Astrid (Jenna Ortega) is certain her mom can\u2019t actually see ghosts, Lydia knows that her eyes aren\u2019t playing tricks on her when she spots Beetlejuice during one of her tapings. And when Lydia\u2019s overbearing boyfriend Rory (Justin Theroux) tries to prove that she\u2019s just imagining things, his thrice-over utterance of Beetlejuice\u2019s name sends them all straight to the afterlife for an unhinged reunion of sorts that none of them are prepared for.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\n\nIn the grand scheme of Warner Bros.\u2019 decision to greenlight a gritty, Batman-free Joker film that had nothing to do with its core cinematic universe of DC films, there\u2019s a certain kind of poetry to the way things played out with Todd Phillips\u2019 Folie \u00e0 Deux. At first blush, the idea of a jukebox musical about the Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) falling in love with Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga) while they\u2019re both doing time in Arkham Asylum sounded inspired. And you could see how, with the right story, a song-filled take on the iconic criminals might make for an enjoyable change of pace from WB\u2019s previous forays into Gotham."

            "article_content": "(ID 328527023 \u00a9 Dmitry Buksha | Dreamstime.com)\n\nStudy reveals extraordinary self-healing potential in advanced heart failure patients\n\nTUCSON, Ariz. \u2014 For decades, medical science has insisted that the human heart cannot repair itself in any meaningful way. This dogma, as fundamental to cardiology as a heartbeat itself, is now being challenged by game-changing research that reveals our hearts may possess an extraordinary power of regeneration\u2014provided they\u2019re given the right conditions to heal.\n\nThe study, published in Circulation, offers potential new directions for treating heart failure, a condition that affects nearly 7 million U.S. adults and accounts for 14% of deaths annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTraditionally, the medical community has viewed the human heart as having minimal regenerative capabilities. Unlike skeletal muscles that can heal after injury, cardiac muscle tissue has been thought to have very limited repair capacity.\n\n\u201cWhen a heart muscle is injured, it doesn\u2019t grow back. We have nothing to reverse heart muscle loss,\u201d says Dr. Hesham Sadek, director of the Sarver Heart Center at the University of Arizona College of Medicine \u2013 Tucson, in a statement.\n\nIt\u2019s long believed that human heart muscle cells weren\u2019t capable of regeneration, but a new study shows the \u201cstrongest evidence\u201d yet, researchers say. (\u00a9 appledesign \u2013 stock.adobe.com)\n\nHowever, this new research, conducted by an international team of scientists, demonstrates that hearts supported by mechanical assist devices can achieve cellular renewal rates significantly higher than previously observed. The study examined tissue samples from 52 patients with advanced heart failure, including 28 who received left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) \u2013 mechanical pumps surgically implanted to help weakened hearts pump blood more effectively.\n\nThe research methodology centered on an innovative approach to tracking cell renewal. Using a technique that measures carbon-14 levels in cellular DNA \u2013 taking advantage of elevated atmospheric levels from Cold War nuclear testing \u2013 researchers could effectively date when cardiac cells were created. This method provided unprecedented insight into the heart\u2019s regenerative processes.\n\nThe findings revealed a stark contrast between different patient groups. In healthy hearts, cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) naturally renew at approximately 0.5% per year. However, in failing hearts, this renewal rate drops dramatically \u2013 to 0.03% in cases of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (heart failure not caused by blocked arteries) and 0.01% in ischemic cardiomyopathy (heart failure from blocked arteries).\n\nCardiac muscle cells, or cardiomyocyte, under a microscope. (Credit: Trevor Atkeson and Madhavi Pandya, Garvan Institute)\n\nThe most significant finding emerged from patients who responded positively to LVAD support. These \u201cresponders,\u201d who showed improved cardiac function, demonstrated cardiomyocyte renewal rates more than six times higher than those seen in healthy hearts. This observation provides what Dr. Sadek calls \u201cthe strongest evidence we have, so far, that human heart muscle cells can actually regenerate.\u201d\n\nThe study builds upon previous research, including Dr. Sadek\u2019s 2011 publication in Science showing that heart muscle cells actively divide during fetal development but cease shortly after birth to focus solely on pumping blood. His 2014 research provided initial evidence of cell division in artificial heart patients, laying the groundwork for the current study.\n\nThe mechanism behind this increased regeneration may be linked to the unique way LVADs support heart function. These devices effectively provide cardiac muscle with periods of reduced workload by assisting with blood pumping, potentially creating conditions that enable regeneration. This observation aligns with established knowledge about how other tissues in the body heal and regenerate when given adequate rest.\n\nScientists now hope to figure out why some patients are capable of having the advanced regenerative response and others aren\u2019t. (\u00a9 LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS \u2013 stock.adobe.com)\n\nThe research team found that in failing hearts, most cellular DNA synthesis is directed toward making existing cells larger or more complex through processes called polyploidization and multinucleation, rather than creating new cells. However, in LVAD patients who showed improvement, a significant portion of DNA synthesis was dedicated to generating entirely new cardiac muscle cells \u2013 a more beneficial form of cardiac adaptation.\n\nApproximately 25% of LVAD patients demonstrate this enhanced regenerative response, raising important questions about why some patients respond while others do not. Understanding these differences could be crucial for developing new therapeutic approaches. \u201cThe exciting part now is to determine how we can make everyone a responder,\u201d says Sadek.\n\nThe implications of this research are particularly promising because LVADs are already an established treatment option. As Dr. Sadek points out, \u201cThe beauty of this is that a mechanical heart is not a therapy we hope to deliver to our patients in the future \u2013 these devices are tried and true, and we\u2019ve been using them for years.\u201d"

            "article_content": "On Friday, Conservation International published the discovery of 27 new animal species in Peru's Amazon rainforest, including an 'amphibious mouse' and a spiny mouse. The expedition, conducted over 38 days in 2022 in the Alto Mayo region, documented more than 2,000 species of wildlife and plants.\n\nThe team of 13 scientists, local technicians, and members of Indigenous groups, including the Awaj\u00fan people, ventured into the Alto Mayo landscape, which spans the Andes mountains to the Amazon River and includes the Alto Mayo Protected Forest. They uncovered four new mammals, eight fish species, three amphibians, and ten butterfly species that were previously unknown to science.\n\nAmong the extraordinary new species discovered is an amphibious mouse with partially webbed feet that feeds on aquatic insects. Trond Larsen, Senior Director at Conservation International, described finding the mouse as \"shocking and exciting,\" noting that it was found only in a unique piece of forest threatened by agriculture, suggesting it may not live anywhere else. \"Amphibious rodents are almost mythical to mammal experts,\" Larsen said, according to Clar\u00edn.\n\nAnother remarkable find was a spiny mouse with stiff guard hairs that function similarly to hedgehog spines. The expedition also uncovered a blob-headed fish, a type of armored catfish with an enlarged, blob-like head. Scientists are still uncertain about the function of this peculiar feature. \"The blob-headed fish has an incredibly bizarre head that looks almost like a giant swollen nose,\" Larsen told CNN.\n\nThe team discovered a dwarf squirrel measuring just 14 centimeters long, around half the length of an average gray squirrel. Larsen described the squirrel as \"adorable and beautiful chestnut-brown colour, very fast.\" He added, \"It jumps quickly and hides in the trees.\"\n\nA new species of tree-climbing salamander was also found, abundant but only in a small patch of unique white sand. The researchers documented 955 different plant species and recorded more than 2,000 species of wildlife and plants during the expedition. This included 536 bird species, with 26 classified as threatened, such as the speckle-chested piculet and the long-whiskered owlet.\n\nDespite significant human influence, the Alto Mayo region revealed unexpected high levels of biodiversity. \"We were very surprised to find such high biodiversity in a landscape with so much human influence,\" Larsen stated, according to The Straits Times. The Alto Mayo landscape is a densely populated area, home to 280,000 people, facing pressures from deforestation and agricultural expansion.\n\nThe expedition highlighted the urgent need for conservation efforts in the region. \"Unless steps are taken now to safeguard these sites and help restore parts of the landscape, there's a strong chance they won't persist in the long term,\" Larsen said, emphasizing the threats posed by habitat loss and human activity.\n\nThe involvement of the Awaj\u00fan people was integral to the success of the expedition. \"It was really fantastic to work so closely with the Awaj\u00fan people,\" Larsen expressed, as reported by GreekReporter.com. \"They have extensive traditional knowledge about the forests, animals and plants they live side-by-side with.\" The Indigenous communities provided valuable insights that helped researchers identify and understand the species they discovered.\n\nAmong the recorded species, at least 49 are considered at risk of extinction, including the yellow-tailed woolly monkey and the tree monkey. The findings underscore the importance of protecting areas like Alto Mayo to preserve the rich biodiversity that exists there. Stay updated with the latest news!

Naming these new species will require further research, as many are extremely rare and difficult to collect.\n\nThe article was written with the assistance of a news analysis system."

            "article_content": "OpenAI saved its biggest announcement for the last day of its 12-day \u201cshipmas\u201d event.\n\nOn Friday, the company unveiled o3, the successor to the o1 \u201creasoning\u201d model it released earlier in the year. o3 is a model family, to be more precise \u2014 as was the case with o1. There\u2019s o3 and o3-mini, a smaller, distilled model fine-tuned for particular tasks.\n\nOpenAI makes the remarkable claim that o3, at least in certain conditions, approaches AGI \u2014 with significant caveats. More on that below.\n\nWhy call the new model o3, not o2? Well, trademarks may be to blame. According to The Information, OpenAI skipped o2 to avoid a potential conflict with British telecom provider O2. CEO Sam Altman somewhat confirmed this during a livestream this morning. Strange world we live in, isn\u2019t it?\n\nNeither o3 nor o3-mini are widely available yet, but safety researchers can sign up for a preview for o3-mini starting today. An o3 preview will arrive sometime after; OpenAI didn\u2019t specify when. Altman said that the plan is to launch o3-mini toward the end of January and follow with o3.\n\nThat conflicts a bit with his recent statements. In an interview this week, Altman said that, before OpenAI releases new reasoning models, he\u2019d prefer a federal testing framework to guide monitoring and mitigating the risks of such models.\n\nAnd there are risks. AI safety testers have found that o1\u2019s reasoning abilities make it try to deceive human users at a higher rate than conventional, \u201cnon-reasoning\u201d models \u2014 or, for that matter, leading AI models from Meta, Anthropic, and Google. It\u2019s possible that o3 attempts to deceive at an even higher rate than its predecessor; we\u2019ll find out once OpenAI\u2019s red-team partners release their testing results.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, OpenAI says that it\u2019s using a new technique, \u201cdeliberative alignment,\u201d to align models like o3 with its safety principles. (o1 was aligned the same way.) The company has detailed its work in a new study.\n\nReasoning steps\n\nUnlike most AI, reasoning models such as o3 effectively fact-check themselves, which helps them to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models.\n\nThis fact-checking process incurs some latency. o3, like o1 before it, takes a little longer \u2014 usually seconds to minutes longer \u2014 to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside? It tends to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and mathematics.\n\no3 was trained via reinforcement learning to \u201cthink\u201d before responding via what OpenAI describes as a \u201cprivate chain of thought.\u201d The model can reason through a task and plan ahead, performing a series of actions over an extended period that help it figure out a solution.\n\nIn practice, given a prompt, o3 pauses before responding, considering a number of related prompts and \u201cexplaining\u201d its reasoning along the way. After a while, the model summarizes what it considers to be the most accurate response.\n\no1 was the first large reasoning model \u2014 as we outlined in the original \u201cLearning to Reason\u201d blog, it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d an LLM trained with RL. o3 is powered by further scaling up RL beyond o1, and the strength of the resulting model the resulting model is very, very impressive. (2/n) \u2014 Nat McAleese (@__nmca__) December 20, 2024\n\nNew with o3 versus o1 is the ability to \u201cadjust\u201d the reasoning time. The models can be set to low, medium, or high compute (i.e. thinking time). The higher the compute, the better o3 performs on a task.\n\nNo matter how much compute they have at their disposals, reasoning models such as o3 aren\u2019t flawless, however. While the reasoning component can reduce hallucinations and errors, it doesn\u2019t eliminate them. o1 trips up on games of tic-tac-toe, for instance.\n\nBenchmarks and AGI\n\nOne big question leading up to today was whether OpenAI might claim that its newest models are approaching AGI.\n\nAGI, short for \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d broadly refers to AI that can perform any task a human can. OpenAI has its own definition: \u201chighly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d\n\nAchieving AGI would be a bold declaration. And it carries contractual weight for OpenAI, as well. According to the terms of its deal with close partner and investor Microsoft, once OpenAI reaches AGI, it\u2019s no longer obligated to give Microsoft access to its most advanced technologies (those that meet OpenAI\u2019s AGI definition, that is).\n\nGoing by one benchmark, OpenAI is slowly inching closer to AGI. On ARC-AGI, a test designed to evaluate whether an AI system can efficiently acquire new skills outside the data it was trained on, o3 achieved an 87.5% score on the high compute setting. At its worst (on the low compute setting), the model tripled the performance of o1.\n\nGranted, the high compute setting was exceedingly expensive \u2014 in the order of thousands of dollars per challenge, according to ARC-AGI co-creator Fran\u00e7ois Chollet.\n\nChollet also pointed out that o3 fails on \u201cvery easy tasks\u201d in ARC-AGI, indicating \u2014 in his opinion \u2014 that the model exhibits \u201cfundamental differences\u201d from human intelligence. He has previously noted the evaluation\u2019s limitations, and cautioned against using it as a measure of AI superintelligence.\n\n\u201c[E]arly data points suggest that the upcoming [successor to the ARC-AGI] benchmark will still pose a significant challenge to o3, potentially reducing its score to under 30% even at high compute (while a smart human would still be able to score over 95% with no training),\u201d Chollet continued in a statement. \u201cYou\u2019ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible.\u201d\n\nIncidentally, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll partner with the foundation behind ARC-AGI to help it build the next generation of its AI benchmark, ARC-AGI 2.\n\nOn other tests, o3 blows away the competition.\n\nThe model outperforms o1 by 22.8 percentage points on SWE-Bench Verified, a benchmark focused on programming tasks, and achieves a Codeforces rating \u2014 another measure of coding skills \u2014 of 2727. (A rating of 2400 places an engineer at the 99.2nd percentile.) o3 scores 96.7% on the 2024 American Invitational Mathematics Exam, missing just one question, and achieves 87.7% on GPQA Diamond, a set of graduate-level biology, physics, and chemistry questions. Finally, o3 sets a new record on EpochAI\u2019s Frontier Math benchmark, solving 25.2% of problems; no other model exceeds 2%.\n\nThese claims have to be taken with a grain of salt, of course. They\u2019re from OpenAI\u2019s internal evaluations. We\u2019ll need to wait to see how the model holds up to benchmarking from outside customers and organizations in the future.\n\nA trend\n\nIn the wake of the release of OpenAI\u2019s first series of reasoning models, there\u2019s been an explosion of reasoning models from rival AI companies \u2014 including Google. In early November, DeepSeek, an AI research firm funded by quant traders, launched a preview of its first reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1. That same month, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen team unveiled what it claimed was the first \u201copen\u201d challenger to o1 (in the sense that it could be downloaded, fine-tuned, and run locally).\n\nWhat opened the reasoning model floodgates? Well, for one, the search for novel approaches to refine generative AI. As TechCrunch recently reported, \u201cbrute force\u201d techniques to scale up models are no longer yielding the improvements they once did.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s convinced that reasoning models are the best path forward. They tend to be expensive, for one, thanks to the large amount of computing power required to run them. And while they\u2019ve performed well on benchmarks so far, it\u2019s not clear whether reasoning models can maintain this rate of progress.\n\nInterestingly, the release of o3 comes as one of OpenAI\u2019s most accomplished scientists departs. Alec Radford, the lead author of the academic paper that kicked off OpenAI\u2019s \u201cGPT series\u201d of generative AI models (that is, GPT-3, GPT-4, and so on), announced this week that he\u2019s leaving to pursue independent research.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

            "article_content": "On Friday, Conservation International published the discovery of 27 new animal species in Peru's Amazon rainforest, including an 'amphibious mouse' and a spiny mouse. The expedition, conducted over 38 days in 2022 in the Alto Mayo region, documented more than 2,000 species of wildlife and plants.\n\nThe team of 13 scientists, local technicians, and members of Indigenous groups, including the Awaj\u00fan people, ventured into the Alto Mayo landscape, which spans the Andes mountains to the Amazon River and includes the Alto Mayo Protected Forest. They uncovered four new mammals, eight fish species, three amphibians, and ten butterfly species that were previously unknown to science.\n\nAmong the extraordinary new species discovered is an amphibious mouse with partially webbed feet that feeds on aquatic insects. Trond Larsen, Senior Director at Conservation International, described finding the mouse as \"shocking and exciting,\" noting that it was found only in a unique piece of forest threatened by agriculture, suggesting it may not live anywhere else. \"Amphibious rodents are almost mythical to mammal experts,\" Larsen said, according to Clar\u00edn.\n\nAnother remarkable find was a spiny mouse with stiff guard hairs that function similarly to hedgehog spines. The expedition also uncovered a blob-headed fish, a type of armored catfish with an enlarged, blob-like head. Scientists are still uncertain about the function of this peculiar feature. \"The blob-headed fish has an incredibly bizarre head that looks almost like a giant swollen nose,\" Larsen told CNN.\n\nThe team discovered a dwarf squirrel measuring just 14 centimeters long, around half the length of an average gray squirrel. Larsen described the squirrel as \"adorable and beautiful chestnut-brown colour, very fast.\" He added, \"It jumps quickly and hides in the trees.\"\n\nA new species of tree-climbing salamander was also found, abundant but only in a small patch of unique white sand. The researchers documented 955 different plant species and recorded more than 2,000 species of wildlife and plants during the expedition. This included 536 bird species, with 26 classified as threatened, such as the speckle-chested piculet and the long-whiskered owlet.\n\nDespite significant human influence, the Alto Mayo region revealed unexpected high levels of biodiversity. \"We were very surprised to find such high biodiversity in a landscape with so much human influence,\" Larsen stated, according to The Straits Times. The Alto Mayo landscape is a densely populated area, home to 280,000 people, facing pressures from deforestation and agricultural expansion.\n\nThe expedition highlighted the urgent need for conservation efforts in the region. \"Unless steps are taken now to safeguard these sites and help restore parts of the landscape, there's a strong chance they won't persist in the long term,\" Larsen said, emphasizing the threats posed by habitat loss and human activity.\n\nThe involvement of the Awaj\u00fan people was integral to the success of the expedition. \"It was really fantastic to work so closely with the Awaj\u00fan people,\" Larsen expressed, as reported by GreekReporter.com. \"They have extensive traditional knowledge about the forests, animals and plants they live side-by-side with.\" The Indigenous communities provided valuable insights that helped researchers identify and understand the species they discovered.\n\nAmong the recorded species, at least 49 are considered at risk of extinction, including the yellow-tailed woolly monkey and the tree monkey. The findings underscore the importance of protecting areas like Alto Mayo to preserve the rich biodiversity that exists there. Stay updated with the latest news!

Naming these new species will require further research, as many are extremely rare and difficult to collect.\n\nThe article was written with the assistance of a news analysis system."

            "article_content": "Yeah! Science! Scientists at the CERN Large Hadron Collider \u2013 the most powerful particle accelerator ever built \u2013 have detected the heaviest form of antimatter observed. This discovery is as important as CERN's previous breakthroughs, like the Higgs Boson particle, B-meson decay, and hypernuclei.\n\nScientists from the ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) at CERN's Large Hadron Collider reported evidence of a new antimatter particle called antihyperhelium-4, essentially the \"evil twin\" of another weird particle called hyperhelium-4. This incredibly exotic form of matter contains two antiprotons, an antineutron, and an unstable particle called an antilambda comprised of subatomic quarks.\n\nThis discovery is important because it allowed physicists to study the extreme conditions of the cosmos when it was less than a second old. It also gives us insights into one of our biggest mysteries: the baryon asymmetry problem.\n\nWhen the universe burst into existence during the Big Bang, matter and antimatter should have existed in equal amounts. Since the opposing pairs always annihilate each other, all matter and antimatter should have converted into pure energy. Somehow, we ended up with a universe dominated by regular matter, with just a tiny bit of antimatter surviving. Studying hyperhelium and its antimatter twin could help unlock this puzzle.\n\nThe discovery of antihyperhelium-4 resulted from a collision experiment performed with the LHC in 2018. It slammed together lead ions at stupendous speeds, recreating the hyper-hot conditions of the newborn universe. Researchers then used a cutting-edge machine learning model to study the data from the collision. The analysis spotted the signature of antihyperhelium-4 particles as they decayed into other particles.\n\nAlso spotted was the lighter antihyperhydrogen-4. The researchers precisely measured the masses of these two particles and were able to match the data with the most current physics theories. The experiment's results confirm that matter and antimatter are created in equal portions. So, what tipped the balance if the universe started with level proportions?\n\nPhysicists are still without adequate answers. However, the LHC receives occasional upgrades, like the one that installed supersized magnets for sharper beams earlier this month. Who knows what new antimatter extremes may emerge next?"

The second most important thing is that the odds for your qualifying wager don\u2019t matter. For instance, if you think Tennessee will win the game, you don\u2019t have to bet on the moneyline with +220 odds. You don\u2019t even have to bet on the Vols\u2019 point spread (+7.5) with -110 odds.\n\nIf you think Ohio State will win, you don\u2019t have to wager on the Buckeyes to win by eight points (and covering the 7.5-point spread). You could bet on the Buckeyes on the moneyline (-280 odds). If you want something safer, there are more options at FanDuel. The sportsbook offers alternate point spreads and totals.\n\nYou can wager on Tennessee +33.5 or Ohio State +18.5. The over/under is 46.5 points, but FanDuel offers a total as low as 17.5 points so you could bet Over on that. You can go as high as 76.5 points for the total and bet Under. You won\u2019t get much of a profit on your $5 wager if you bet one of those extremes, but that isn\u2019t important. You just want to win so you can grab your $150 welcome bonus."

            "article_content": "In 2025 we will see AI and machine learning leveraged to make real progress in understanding animal communication, answering a question that has puzzled humans as long as we have existed: \u201cWhat are animals saying to each other?\u201d The recent Coller-Dolittle Prize, offering cash prizes up to half-a-million dollars for scientists who \u201ccrack the code\u201d is an indication of a bullish confidence that recent technological developments in machine learning and large language models (LLMs) are placing this goal within our grasp.\n\nMany research groups have been working for years on algorithms to make sense of animal sounds. Project Ceti, for example, has been decoding the click trains of sperm whales and the songs of humpbacks. These modern machine learning tools require extremely large amounts of data, and up until now, such quantities of high-quality and well-annotated data have been lacking.\n\nConsider LLMs such as ChatGPT that have training data available to them that includes the entirety of text available on the internet. Such information on animal communication hasn't been accessible in the past. It\u2019s not just that human data corpora are many orders of magnitude larger than the kind of data we have access to for animals in the wild: More than 500 GB of words were used to train GPT-3, compared to just more than 8,000 \u201ccodas\u201d (or vocalizations) for Project Ceti\u2019s recent analysis of sperm whale communication.\n\nAdditionally, when working with human language, we already know what is being said. We even know what constitutes a \u201cword,\u201d which is a huge advantage over interpreting animal communication, where scientists rarely know whether a particular wolf howl, for instance, means something different from another wolf howl, or even whether the wolves consider a howl as somehow analogous to a \u201cword\u201d in human language.\n\nREAD MORE This story is from the WIRED World in 2025, our annual trends briefing.\n\nNonetheless, 2025 will bring new advances, both in the quantity of animal communication data available to scientists, and in the types and power of AI algorithms that can be applied to those data. Automated recording of animal sounds has been placed in easy reach of every scientific research group, with low-cost recording devices such as AudioMoth exploding in popularity.\n\nMassive datasets are now coming online, as recorders can be left in the field, listening to the calls of gibbons in the jungle or birds in the forest, 24/7, across long periods of time. There were occasions when such massive datasets were impossible to manage manually. Now, new automatic detection algorithms based on convolutional neural networks can race through thousands of hours of recordings, picking out the animal sounds and clustering them into different types, according to their natural acoustic characteristics.\n\nOnce those large animal datasets are available, new analytical algorithms become a possibility, such as using deep neural networks to find hidden structure in sequences of animal vocalizations, which may be analogous to the meaningful structure in human language.\n\nHowever, the fundamental question that remains unclear is, what exactly are we hoping to do with these animal sounds? Some organizations, such as Interspecies.io, set its goal quite clearly as, \u201cto transduce signals from one species into coherent signals for another.\u201d In other words, to translate animal communication into human language. Yet most scientists agree that non-human animals do not have an actual language of their own\u2014at least not in the way that we humans have language.\n\nThe Coller Dolittle Prize is a little more sophisticated, looking for a way \u201cto communicate with or decipher an organism\u2019s communication.\u201d Deciphering is a slightly less ambitious goal than translating, considering the possibility that animals may not, in fact, have a language that can be translated. Today we don\u2019t know just how much information, or how little, animals convey between themselves. In 2025, humanity will have the potential to leapfrog our understanding of not just how much animals say but also what exactly they are saying to each other."

            "article_content": "Flavor Discovery\n\nThe company behind Oreo cookies has, by its own admission, been quietly creating new flavors using machine learning.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal reports, Mondelez \u2014 the processed food behemoth that manufactures Oreos, Chips Ahoy, Clif Bars, and other popular snacks \u2014 has developed a new AI tool to dream up new flavors for its brands.\n\nUsed in more than 70 of the company's products, the company says the machine learning tool is different from generative AI tools like ChatGPT and more akin to the drug discovery algorithms used by pharmaceutical companies to find and test new medications rapidly. Thus far the tool, created with the help of the software consultant Fourkind, has created products like the \"Gluten Free Golden Oreo\" and updated Chips Ahoy's classic recipe, per the WSJ.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMondelez's research and development AI was, it seems, trained to optimize certain sensory factors. The tool was told to dial up scent characteristics like \"burnt,\" \"egg-flavored,\" and \"oily,\" as well as flavor factors like \"buttery,\u201d \"in-mouth saltiness,\" and \"vanilla intensity,\" among others.\n\nIt's unclear how nuanced the AI's perception of these flavors really is, since machines lack taste buds or noses, though the company does employ human taste testers to check it all out \u2014 and as \"biscuit modeling\" research and development manager Kevin Wallenstein indicated to the paper, Mondelez is very thorough with that aspect of its flavor creation process.\n\n\"The number of tastings we have is not fun,\" the biscuit baron told the WSJ. \"I used to work in Sour Patch Kids, and if you did a tasting every day for a week, it was a nightmare.\"\n\nHistory Matters\n\nThough the company didn't indicate how long it had been using the flavor discovery tool, it told the WSJ that the machine learning algorithm had been in development since 2019, a timeline that jibes with a 2023 interview in which Mondelez R&D exec Joe Manton teased the tool's existence to the magazine Just Food.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Manton suggested when speaking to the industry magazine, Mondelez's R&D team used historical recipe and ingredient data when creating the AI. In that same interview, he added that new flavors \"go through a series of internal and external consumer testing\" as well.\n\nIn the more recent WSJ article about the tool, Wallenstein admitted that in its earlier days, the AI would offer unhinged suggestions.\n\n\"Because [baking soda is] a very low-cost ingredient,\" he said, \"it would try to just make cookies that were very high in baking soda, which doesn\u2019t taste good at all.\"\n\nBy bringing in human \"brand stewards\" to oversee the process, Mondelez seems to have fine-tuned its machine-learning tool. Much like pharmaceutical drug discovery, it's an undeniably fascinating \u2014 if not admittedly bizarre \u2014 use of AI.\n\nMore on AI and food: Someone Made a Deranged Version of Coke's AI Holiday Ad and It's Way Better"

Israel was involved in four conflicts in the region, including with Hamas in Gaza and Iran. Peace remained elusive in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine that began over two years back read more\n\nA displaced Palestinian woman, Makram Hamdouna, carries a water container outside her shelter, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip December 19, 2024. Reuters\n\n2024 was a year of war. The wider conflict in West Asia and Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine made headlines throughout the year. Data by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) shows that an estimated 233,000 people were killed in conflicts this year.\n\nIsrael\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza completed a year in October. The Jewish state reached a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah in Lebanon to end 13 months of fighting. Israeli strikes are pounding against Houthi targets in Yemen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTensions mounted between Iran and Israel, with both sides launching tit-for-tat attacks. The shadow war between the two countries has burst into the open since Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel last October.\n\nAfter 13 years of civil war, Syria saw the fall of its dictator, Bashar al-Assad. Since his ouster, Israel has launched a bombing campaign on the West Asian country.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine entered its 1,000th day on November 24 this year. Even after over two years, there is no end in sight to the conflict.\n\nIn our yearly wrap, here is a look at the conflicts around the world.\n\n1. Israel was engaged in four wars in West Asia this year. On October 7, 2024, Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza completed one year. It was on this day last year that the Palestinian militant group\u2019s surprise attack on the Jewish nation changed West Asia and the world. We explain how Hamas\u2019 attack was a turning point in the region.\n\nThousands have died in Israel and Gaza since the war began last year. Many hostages taken by Hamas fighters last October remain captive in Gaza. Israel\u2019s relentless strikes on the narrow enclave have taken a mental toll on innocent civilians, especially children. We take a look at how the conflict has affected children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael achieved its biggest victory in the war by killing its enemy no 1, Yahya Sinwar. Israel had accused Sinwar, 61, of being the mastermind of the Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023 attack. Here\u2019s what we know about the man dubbed \u201cbutcher of Khan Younis\u201d.\n\n2. West Asia inched closer to a wider war in the region as Israel and Iran carried out tit-for-tat missile strikes. In October, Israel launched three waves of overnight strikes on Iran in retaliation to Tehran launching at least 180 missiles into Israel earlier that month.\n\nIran had said its attack against Israel was in response to the assassination of the Lebanese group Hezbollah\u2019s leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander Abbas Nilforoushan in Beirut, and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there is a lull in tensions now, we explore who has the bigger and better military.\n\n3. Israel intensified attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon, with the group blaming the West Asian country for exploding pager and walkie-talkie attacks that killed or wounded thousands of its members.\n\nSmoke rises following an Israeli airstrike on Dahiyeh, in Beirut, Lebanon, November 26, 2024. File Photo/AP\n\nIn November, the two sides reached a ceasefire agreement, ending monthslong conflict that has taken the lives of over 3,700 people. The deal brokered by the United States calls for a 60-day halt in fighting. However, within a week of the fragile truce, there were mutual accusations of violations. Will the ceasefire hold? We explain in this report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Yemen\u2019s Houthis, a part of Iran\u2019s so-called Axis of Resistance, have been targeting commercial and military ships linked to Israel and its allies in the Red Sea since Israel launched its war against Hamas last October.\n\nThis year, Israel escalated attacks against the rebel group, with the Houthis claiming to target the Jewish country with drones and ballistic missiles. Find out about this rebel group in Yemen in this report.\n\n5. After 13 years of civil war, Syrian rebels overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in just a matter of a few days. With Assad fleeing to Russia, the horrors of his regime are coming to light. Since his ouster, families have been desperately searching for their loved ones who went missing after being detained by the secret police. His regime is believed to have killed and buried more than 100,000 people in mass graves. The horrors have just begun to unravel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile insurgents have taken control of Damascus, Israel has carried out a volley of airstrikes in the country. Targets have included air defence systems, fighter jets, missile depots, weapons production sites and so on.\n\nIt is also planning to expand its settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, citing threats from Syria. We take a look at why Israel is eyeing the strategic plateau and why it is targeting the West Asian country.\n\n6. It has been over two years since Russia invaded Ukraine. Death and devastation followed after Russian President Vladimir Putin addressed his nation, announcing a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine on February 24, 2022. World powers, including incoming US President Donald Trump, have called for a ceasefire. However, peace has so far remained elusive.\n\nTensions could further escalate after Ukraine claimed responsibility for killing a top Russian general in a bomb blast in Moscow. Here\u2019s who he was.\n\nThis is all we have for you in our yearly roundup. If you like the way we explain hot topics from around the globe, you can bookmark this page."

There was also a $10 billion provision for economic assistance to farmers in the bill.\n\nThe Senate worked into early Saturday morning to pass the bill 85-11, just after the deadline following a chaotic week on Capitol Hill.\n\nSENATE PASSES BILL TO STOP SHUTDOWN, SENDING IT TO PRESIDENT BIDEN'S DESK\n\nPresident Biden has not yet publicly commented on the passage of the legislation.\n\n\"H.R. 10545, the \u2018American Relief Act, 2025,\u2019 which provides fiscal year 2025 appropriations to Federal agencies through March 14, 2025, for continuing projects and activities of the Federal Government; provides disaster relief appropriations and economic assistance to farmers; extends the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018; and extends several expiring authorities,\" a White House statement reads.\n\nWHITE HOUSE PRESSED ON BIDEN REFUSING TO SPEAK PUBLICLY AHEAD OF SHUTDOWN\n\nPresident-elect Trump has not spoken publicly since the bill\u2019s passage either, although sources tell Fox that the incoming president is not that happy about the bill because it does not suspend the debt ceiling.\n\nTrump had called on Republicans to act on the debt limit as part of their talks to avert a government shutdown, a demand that dozens of conservative GOP lawmakers bristled at given their concerns about the national debt \u2014 which has exceeded $36 trillion.\n\nA bulging 1,547-page continuing resolution (CR) was thrown into disarray earlier in the week following objections by Elon Musk and President-elect Trump. A slimmed-down version was then rejected by House members on Thursday before the House approved Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s new bill overwhelmingly by 366 votes to 34 on Friday.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre warned on Friday that a shutdown could have disrupted the incoming administration's presidential transition process.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised the passage of the funding legislation early Saturday.\n\n\"There will be no government shutdown right before Christmas,\" Schumer wrote on X. \"We will keep the government open with a bipartisan bill that funds the government, helps Americans affected by hurricanes and natural disasters, helps our farmers and avoids harmful cuts.\n\nFox News' Julia Johnson and Elizabeth Elkind contributed to this report."

Pricing and availability subject to change.\n\nUnix workstations were powerful computers for science and 3D animation, popular in the '80s and '90s.\n\nWorkstations had advanced features like high-res monitors, faster processors, and RISC processors.\n\nWorkstations merged with PCs over time, but you can still find high-performance workstations.\n\nIn the '80s and early '90s, powerful Unix workstations dominated technical tasks like science and 3D animation. Let's find out where they went and where you can still find them today.\n\nWhat Were Unix Workstations?\n\nUnix workstations were powerful computers that ran some variant of Unix. As the name implies, they were meant for serious work such as software development, CAD, or graphics. They were widely used by scientists, engineers, researchers, and computer animators in academia and industry.\n\nSun Microsystems, HP, and Silicon Graphics were some of the biggest manufacturers of workstations in that era. Unix was popular on these systems because it was easier than writing a system from scratch and the source code was available, even if it was at a steep price. Developers were also familiar with Unix from their college days.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis clip from 1987 shows how workstations were heavily used for 3D graphics back then:\n\nWow, a whole four megabytes!\n\nWorkstations had larger monitors with higher resolutions than PCs at the time, which was important for the graphically intensive work they were used for. They also had more memory and faster processors. Workstations were early adopters of RISC processors for higher performance, like the SPARC or MIPS architectures.\n\nWorkstation History\n\nBefore workstations arrived on the scene, it was minicomputers that served most computer users. Minicomputers (not to be confused with mini PCs), were computers that were smaller than mainframes but still typically shared with mutiple users, popular for things like smaller scientific computations, software development, and factory automation. While minicomputers were occasionally dedicated to a single user, this was rare, as minis were generally considered too expensive to do so.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA precursor to the workstation as a standalone computer intended for one user at a time was the Xerox Alto, a prototype from the 1970s that pioneered the graphical user interface. While it was never offered for sale, it also inspired the development of the Apple Macintosh.\n\nThe Three Rivers PERQ was the first modern workstation, a single-user computer with the power of a minicomputer in a personal form factor intended for scientific and engineering work.\n\nThe first Unix workstation was the SUN board created by Andy Bechtolsheim at Stanford. Sun Microsystems later commercialized it. Other workstations came on the market, such as the famous Silicon Graphics line of systems. These systems were used for technical tasks such as software development, CAD/CAM, and 3D animation, including movies like \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Toy Story.\"\n\nWorkstations and PCs Merge\n\nAs early as 1989, observers in the computer industry were noticing that with the increasing power of personal computers, the workstation and PC markets were starting to blur, according to Byte magazine.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Intel 386 chip made multitasking PC operating systems viable in the PC market, but the software base, still rooted in MS-DOS, was trying to catch up to the hardware. Unix was multitasking and could be ported easily to new hardware, so observers in the computer world thought that Unix could unseat MS-DOS as an OS of choice for a new range of \"personal workstations.\"\n\nSearch results for \"workstation\" showing Precision workstations on the Dell website.\n\nWhile workstations were aimed at engineers and scientists, they still needed to run business applications alongside technical software. An engineer might need to write a report in a word processor or budget a project in a spreadsheet, and these applications were hard to find on Unix workstations. Or a user might need to exchange documents with someone on a PC.\n\nIf a workstation user had enough desk space or a large enough budget, you might have found a PC sitting next to the workstation for office tasks. The cheaper alternative for this problem was a software compatibility layer, similar to WINE on modern systems. VP/IX and MERGE were popular programs for running DOS on PC Unix systems. Other solutions involved PC boards that plugged into a slot on the system.\n\nCan You Still Buy a Workstation Today?\n\nAs PCs got even more powerful during the '90s, the workstation and PC markets have merged even further, where it's hard to tell the two apart. Windows NT came on the scene and allowed technical users to run technical and business apps together, and Linux on PCs took over from commercial Unix workstations for many scientific users at the same time. Gamers adopted large displays and 3D accelerators that had been the domain of workstations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nStill, it's possible to buy a workstation if you know where to look. Today, they run the same processors and use the same cards and peripherals that ordinary PCs do, but are often engineered for high performance and reliability. Popular options include the Dell Precision, Hp Z series, and Apple Mac Pro. macOS and Linux aren't wholly descended from the original Unix, but are instead influenced enough to be \"Unix-like.\"\n\nManufacturers and OS makers are keeping the flame of '80s and '90s Unix workstations alive."

A thousand years later, Flavius Josephus, the Jewish Roman historian, wrote that the haul had included the balm of Gilead, a fragrant, highly prized resin also known as Judean balsam, which served as the basis for perfumes, incense and medicinal remedies.\n\nThe balsam was said to have been harvested from a plant cultivated in oases around the Dead Sea basin; the plant vanished from the region by the ninth century A.D., setting off a longstanding debate about its scientific identity. \u201cIn ancient accounts, descriptions vary,\u201d said Sarah Sallon, director of natural medicine research at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. \u201cBefore the Common Era, the plant is said to be the size of a tree. But in the first century, the Roman historian Pliny the Elder described it as a shrub that resembled a grapevine.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Dr. Sallon obtained a mysterious seed from the archaeological archives of Hebrew University, hoping that it could germinate. The seed had been discovered in a cave during a 1980s excavation at Wadi el-Makkuk, a winter water channel in the northern Judean desert, and was languishing in storage. After determining that the seed was still viable, Dr. Sallon\u2019s research team planted, sprouted and carefully tended it. When the husk was carbon-dated to between A.D. 993 and A.D. 1202, a thought occurred to Dr. Sallon. \u201cI wondered if what germinated could be the source of the balm of Gilead,\u201d she said. On the hunch that it was, she named the specimen Sheba.\n\nSince then, the 1,000-year-old seedling has grown into a sturdy 12-foot-tall tree with no modern counterpart. Sheba\u2019s painstaking revival \u2014 kept secret from the public for 14 years \u2014 is detailed in a study that was published in September in the journal Communications Biology. \u201cWhy the time lag between the seed\u2019s germination and the publication of the research?\u201d Dr. Sallon said. \u201cThe reason is I wanted to make sure that Sheba wasn\u2019t the Judean balsam, which is something that I would only definitively know by smell.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The Great Mystification.\n\nTwo concepts call for socialist meditation, because they imply problems of permanent urgency: utopia and revolution. Rarely have these two problems been examined in their relationship of reciprocal affirmation and negation, i.e., in their dialectical relationship, except to reject them wholesale or accept only one term: whoever posits revolution seems to exclude or reject utopia; and conversely, whoever posits utopia seems to reject revolution. Such, at least, was the attitude of nineteenth-century socialist thinkers. In the twentieth century, the debate had found some scope for confrontation up until the First World War, without going beyond the ideological quarrels periodically renewed between Marxists and non-Marxists, or between anarchists and Marxists. Since then, there has been silence: the tumult of contemporary history has rendered inaudible any voice urging renewed discussion. And yet, if ever the idea of a socialist humanism required reflection, it is today, when under the name of socialism, or even humanism, regimes are developing that reproduce and amplify the defects of capitalism, while trampling underfoot the democratic conquests of bourgeois revolutions, long considered the condition for socialism. It took an incredible perversion of language and logic to succumb, often with total good faith, to the most vulgar propaganda, and to believe that today's world is really divided into two camps, the \u201csocialist\u201d camp and the \u201ccapitalist\u201d camp. All regimes, no matter how acute their conflicts of interest, propagate this alleged division as an article of faith. Western regimes eagerly acknowledge the socialist character displayed by their Eastern rivals, for they thereby gain a considerable propaganda benefit: they discredit socialism, by showing that so-called socialist regimes deceive the masses in their aspirations for a dignified and free life. In turn, these regimes spare no effort to make their people believe that the material and moral conditions in which they live are (or soon will be) superior to those of the masses under the yoke of capital. If religious consolation is much less the opium of Western peoples than it once was, the new narcotic offered to the peoples of Eastern Europe is called Marxism. Words neither live nor die like human beings; their meaning is transformed according to the intentions and interests of those who manipulate them. By a harmful and strange alteration of their meaning, words can mean the opposite of what they originally meant. Such is the case with the word socialism. Created at a time when industrial mechanization was ushering in the era of mass misery, it denoted the hope of a new society, the desire for a better way of life: utopia as tomorrow's reality. The nascent socialist and communist schools discussed and refined its content, and in February 1848, an anonymous pamphlet printed in London predicted, along with the fatal ruin of class society, the coming of the communist city defined in these terms: \u201cAn association where the free development of each is the condition of the free development of all.\u201d (The Communist Manifesto.) Nothing resembles this definition less than the contemporary world. Yet we manage to make people believe that part of our globe is now communist or moving towards communism. And, in a supreme perversion, regimes where people are relatively less free and where the police state has more rights over the individual than in capitalist countries are called socialist. In this way, Utopia is desecrated and the values of socialism are scorned.\n\nIt is said and believed that, since the Russian Revolution of October 1917, the world has entered a new era: the era of socialism; that since the Second World War, a third of the world has become socialist, and that the two wars made this revolutionary transformation possible. Those who say or think this generally choose a single criterion to justify this thesis: the abolition of private property, known as the socialization of the means of production. This thesis is opposed by another: there is no socialism in today's world. What we call socialism, by misuse of language, is in reality nothing more than a new form of exploitation and oppression of man by man: state property, which is just as murderous as private property; we should call it state capitalism.\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that the legal regulation of property rights by state power is either the means or the end of a socialist order. If we disregard the legal forms that appear to regulate human relations, and stick to these relations themselves, what do we find? Simply that the human status of so-called socialist countries is fundamentally, essentially the same as that of capitalist countries.\n\nIf things have turned into a dialogue of the deaf, if this perversion of language has been able to take place so easily, it's because another word has suffered a similar fate: revolution. Revolutions have taken place; social structures have been violently overturned, but the character of these upheavals is obvious: in reality, they are nothing more than economic revolutions, which constitute an aggravation of the phenomena that the pioneers of socialism denounced as \u201cthe exploitation of man by man\u201d. If the debate between the \u201cfree world\u201d and the \u201csocialist world\u201d were merely a matter of words, it wouldn't be worth our attention. But behind this verbal quarrel lies a vital issue of our time. Can humanity survive without the disappearance of the social institutions that currently burden and regiment it? In other words, is human life still possible under the domination of the state and capital? This question, it seems to us, should be at the heart of any debate on socialist humanism.\n\nBack to Basics.\n\nMarxism is not the entire ideology of socialism. Nor is it all its thought. Both in its ethical aspects and in its theoretical claims, socialist thought can be traced back to the industrial revolution that began in England in the last third of the 18th century. From the outset, it had all the hallmarks of a new gospel, a message of earthly liberation and salvation, in a word, a new ethic. However, however visionary the first socialists or communists of the industrial age may have seemed, they had a fairly clear conception of the means that could lead to the realization of their dream goal. Thus, for William Godwin, social metamorphosis could only result from a revolution of reason, whereas for Gracchus Babeuf, reason could only be imposed by violence, and therefore folly: proclaimed at first as a legal action, the revolution, because of the closure of the Pantheon club, became the business of a \u201csecret directoire\u201d, charged with acting \u201cby and for the people\u201d. Babeuf's plan was to seize power \u201cin order to hand it over to the people\u201d. But steps had to be taken, as the people, called to the polls, were capable of bringing back tyranny. It was therefore necessary to make them capable of exercising sovereignty.\n\nIrresistibly, once on this slope of impatience and \u201cprovisional\u201d authority, Babouvism thinks of revolution as organized warfare, conducted according to the rules of the art: hierarchy, discipline, obedience, command, specialist strategy and so on. It's a revolution directed from above, by a general staff or a group of experts, in the expectation that it will be remade from below, or at least that those below will take over once the enemy has been defeated and power conquered. Such is the ambition of Babouvism, and it will reappear with Auguste Blanqui and his followers: honesty and good intentions are given as pledges to the still ignorant people, reduced to the state of inert matter or, more precisely, a mass of maneuver in the battle to defeat the enemy. Violence organized and directed from above is the essence of the Babouvist credo. Its humanism is in the intention, the goal, the utopia; it's not in the means, unless you consider the acts of vengeance perpetrated by the revolting masses as manifestations of a will to liberate: it's the purpose of violence that humanizes violence, since it aims to establish a society without violence.\n\nThe danger and weakness of this conception lies in the impossibility of foreseeing and judging, of choosing and evaluating methods and attitudes from a humanist perspective. From Babouvism to Bolshevik Marxism, the lineage is direct and sometimes openly acknowledged. Utopian socialism returns to the tradition of humanist rationalism that predates the French Revolution. For Saint-Simon, the spiritual heir of the Encyclopedists, political power, capable of reason and reform, plays only a secondary role. The \u201cNew Christianity\u201d is the ethics of power, which will no longer be political, but administrative (stewardship). This economic-social Christianity, the science of production, is, in short, industrialism for the benefit of mankind, the guarantee of bread, politics replaced by industrial organization, whose sole aim is to \u201censure the freest development of the faculties of all men\u201d. This is Saint-Simon's spiritual testament.\n\nUtopians claim to reform society in the name of reason and science. Robert Owen has a sense of reality, and his socialism is experimental: cooperation is the beginning and the end of the solution to social problems. Owen lacked the sumptuous delirium of Charles Fourier; he was unimaginative and his doctrine was reduced to a few elementary ideas, one of which was essential: man is what his environment makes him. Yet this pioneer of cooperative socialism was always in the breach, calling for spontaneous effort, distrust and even hostility towards the powerful, the rich and the rulers. If socialism means cooperation, then Owen was the first socialist. And if Marx's socialism is ultimately the cooperative system or mode of production, it's because he was Owen's disciple.\n\nKarl Marx.\n\nMarx did not abolish utopia; on the contrary, he renewed its meaning, broadening its sphere of application. For him, utopia becomes a single, two-stage process: revolution-creation. Before him, utopians had imagined and thought about creation independently of the men by whom the new city was to be built; at most, they had counted on an elite. Marx saw men first: \u201cWe know that to do useful work, the new forces of society need to be mastered by new men: such are the workers.\u201d (Address to a Chartist meeting, April 1856).\n\nInitially a disciple of Fourier and Owen, and soon deeply involved in the political struggle, Marx never broke the spiritual ties that bound him to the socialist utopia. In this respect, it's enough to read the clarification he was about to provide, two years before his death, to the Russian populists who asked him for his opinion on the chances and prospects of the peasant commune in the face of the threat of capitalism's penetration of Russia. At no point in this long and painful reflection does Marx tackle properly political problems, such as class constitution or party organization. Instead, he concentrates on the original characteristics of the archaic institution of the rural commune, and its importance as a \u201cregenerative element of Russian society\u201d and as an \u201celement of superiority over the countries enslaved by the capitalist regime\u201d. It's easy to recognize, in this apology for the \u201clocalized microcosm\u201d that for Marx is the Russian commune, the final tribute he pays to Robert Owen, pioneer of cooperative and communitarian socialism. Marx, like his utopian predecessor, puts all his trust in the creative spontaneity of those who produce society's wealth without really enjoying it. He attributes to the primitive commune the virtues of a social microcosm. In this idealization of a still little-known institution, we recognize the projection into the future of a desire-image. It's no coincidence, then, that Marx embraced the Owenian utopia. The cooperative commune he imagined responds to the problem we posed above, that of the opposition between the Jacobin (political) conception and the conception we now call, for greater clarity, communalist of the workers' movement. In the former, the initiative for awareness and action is attributed to' political avant-gardes placed at the head of easily-maneuverable crowds; in the latter, any political elite is deemed superfluous, as the reduced dimensions of the action group allow it to dispense with any stable, and therefore \u201cprofessional\u201d, representation. The delegation of power is not the abandonment of a right, but the handing over of a temporary and imperative mandate for well-defined representative tasks.\n\nIn a sense, Marx is the most utopian of utopians: unconcerned about future society, he is solely concerned with the destruction of present society. But he elevates revolution to the level of a total requirement.\n\nIt is the mechanism of this imaginary or imagined revolution that is utopian: it presupposes men capable of thinking the whole of social criticism, the whole of socialism, men aware of their \u201cgolden\u201d misery.\n\nFor Marx establishes the economic law of pauperization, which is harder to grasp than naked, unphrased misery. He implants the utopia of the future in the struggle of the present, and proposes a dialectic of workers' revolution: if the proletariat is capable of wanting and making its revolution, socialism will be given to it by surcro\u00eet, in other words: by becoming aware of their state of alienation (in the profound sense that Marx gave to this Hegelian term), workers are both capable of destroying capitalist society and building utopia: a society without state, without classes, without money. From then on, Marx's conception of revolution contained a strange paradox: it was at the height of misery that workers were supposed to become aware of the need for total revolution, for a regenerated society. Strange \u201cmaterialism\u201d that conceives of such a spiritual metamorphosis of the slave broken by a pitiless machine, reduced himself to the state of a cog in the great industrial mechanism operating with a single aim: profit.\n\nIt was from these masses of disinherited people, and not from an intellectual elite, that \u201ccommunist consciousness\u201d was supposed to \u201cemanate\u201d (The German Ideology). The psychological process is thus reversed: bourgeois intellectuals can only become communists by rising to the level of the revolutionary consciousness of slave-workers.\n\nSuch is the paradox of the workers' movement. Yet the theory remains coherent: Marx distinguishes between socialist consciousness and socialist science. This science (theory) is only possible and necessary as a function of the real movement of the working class, which is a two-faceted process: awareness and political action.\n\nBy giving itself political representatives, the proletariat proclaims its determination to overturn the existing established order, by recourse to the force of law or the laws of force, depending on the circumstances: \u201cThe proletariat constitutes itself as a class and therefore as a political party\u201d, declares the Communist Manifesto, clearly showing that this is a spontaneous act of creation and awareness by the proletarians, in no way an adhesion to constituted parties outside their ranks. The bourgeoisie is a constituted class whose unity is cemented by the profit motive. The proletariat constitutes itself as a class by forging its unity and cohesion through the struggle to defend its immediate interests and its awareness of a revolutionary goal. This is what Marx formulated in a single sentence that is the implicit postulate of all true socialist thought, enunciated as early as 1844 by Flora Tristan: \u201cThe emancipation of the workers will be the work of the workers themselves.\u201d\n\nUnions, parties and councils are all forms of working-class organization, which only exist as spontaneous, conscious creations of the working class. The proletariat constitutes itself by organizing its struggle, but the workers who make it up must not abandon themselves to elite bodies (or parties) that claim to guide them and prescribe their political and social objectives.\n\nThis is the idea frequently taken up by Marx and Engels in their criticism of party men who, coming from the bourgeois intelligentsia, set themselves up as political guides for the workers. Certainly, intellectuals have a role to play in the workers' movement, but they can only fulfill it effectively by bringing to the movement \u201celements of culture\u201d, and by no means a ready-made theory or philosophy, an esoteric doctrine of the march and ends of history, a dialectic of revolutionary action. This was Marx's deepest thought, even if his attitudes as a man and as a \u201cparty leader\u201d did not always conform strictly to the principle of workers' self-emancipation, even if, through the use of certain political means, he sometimes betrayed this principle.\n\nMarxism judged by Marx.\n\nThe real problem lies not in antinomies such as anarchism and Marxism, Marxism and reformism or Marxism and revisionism; it lies in the opposition of Jacobinism and self-emancipation. It lies in the following question: can social classes retain the autonomy of their action and consciousness by relying on representative organizations, chosen and appointed to express and defend their interests?\n\nThis question contains a dangerous equivocation: can a social class have a conscience, a will, an action? In other words, can it think, will and act in any way other than through \u201cdemocratically\u201d elected representatives, commonly appointed to represent, i.e. express, the will and thoughts of a collectivity? If so, isn't formal or tacit approval of the delegates' decisions and actions the only proof that the group's will and the behavior of its representatives are in accord?\n\nTo ask the question in this way is to answer it. But this answer does not provide the whole solution. Indeed, it implies the answer to another question, a corollary of the first: under what conditions of effectiveness can the delegation of a mandate result in a real \u201crepresentation of interests\u201d?\n\nPre-Marx socialist thought focused primarily on resolving this question. Its solution was the description and definition of the \u201cideal\u201d society. Marx accepted this legacy, and enriched it. His protest was not directed at the substance, but at certain aberrant aspects of so-called utopian socialism. The producers' commune, the cooperative enterprise, the unity of work and culture - in a word, the city liberated from the state and money - represents, in Marx's eyes, the resurrection, at the level of modern technology, of the archaic rural commune, the basis of primitive communism.\n\nAs for the Jacobin conception of the workers' movement, in both its reformist and revolutionary forms, the historical experience of the first half of our century has confirmed its definitive bankruptcy. When Lenin broke the ties he had maintained with Karl Kautsky's ideas until the First World War, he invoked the impotence of the workers' movement in the industrially advanced countries, where the proletariat had been \u201cbetrayed\u201d by an aristocracy drawn from its own ranks. The material and moral conditions for a revolutionary movement, on the other hand, were given in an industrially backward, mainly peasant country like Tsarist Russia. It was here, as in countries under colonial yoke, that the process of socialist revolution could be triggered, if not completed: the misery of the masses was a sufficient guarantee against the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of ambitious, comfort-hungry workers' avant-gardes. To theoretically justify this recourse to classical conceptions of the role and vocation of the social elites, the concept of \u201cpermanent revolution\u201d was borrowed from Marx's terminological arsenal. This concept, reinforced by Lenin's idea of the \u201claw of uneven development\u201d, became the key to the new ideology with its Marxist flavour.\n\nIn truth, Lenin's and his party's theoretical and practical approach was simply the artificial grafting of a revolutionary-minded elite of bourgeois intellectuals onto a convulsing social mass. Its genuinely revolutionary aspirations could easily be exploited by an apparatus of professional revolutionaries for whom Jacobin methods of government held few secrets. The result was not long in coming: having established the presence of a state of \u201cdyarchy\u201d in Russian society liberated from tsarism, and having won the confidence of the soviets, which had spontaneously formed in opposition to the official government, the Bolshevik party succeeded in establishing itself as a monolithic state power. As in countries with an old capitalist tradition, a political \u201caristocracy\u201d aware of its interests and objectives had succeeded in replacing the \u201csocial microcosms\u201d which, according to Marx's theory and utopia, arise spontaneously from the soil of any society in a state of evolution and historical transformation.\n\nMarx may often have overestimated the political factor in the workers' movement, but he never thought for a moment that the working class should surrender to the dialectical wisdom of a party or an elite of political professionals. As we have seen, for Marx, the utopia of revolution is an ethic of revolutionary behavior. The economic and spiritual alienation of the workers is the fundamental cause of the revolutionary act, as well as the central motive for the creative action of the new social order. The proletariat is the direct subject of this transformation, but it is also its object, since it abolishes itself as a wage-earner.\n\nToday, \u201cMarxist empires\u201d are founded on the exploitation of proletarianized masses, forced to perform economic tasks dictated by state plans which, as in liberal capitalist regimes, maintain and reinforce the hierarchy of functions and incomes.\n\nEvery line of Marx, as of his precursors and masters, belies the so-called socialist regimes of our twentieth century.\n\nConclusion.\n\nUtopia and revolution are the two historical coordinates of the workers' movement, the two modes of intuition of socialist thought: utopia is the dimension of space; revolution is the dimension of time. In other words, to become a reality, the socialist movement must think of itself as utopia and revolution, one inseparable from the other. It also means that socialist man must assert himself simultaneously as utopian and revolutionary. Revolution and utopia appear as the normative foundations of the socialist ethic, inseparable from each other. To be a socialist, you have to want revolution and utopia; you have to want the abolition of existing types of society and desire the creation of the new city. Implicit in most socialist doctrines, this ethic has marked and continues to mark many thinkers who claim to be socialists, communists or anarchists. To varying degrees, it has enriched the thinking of Owen and Fourier, Marx and Engels, Proudhon and Bakunin, Sorel and Kropotkin, Oscar Wilde and Gustav Landauer.\n\nBut it must not be confused with the thought \u2014 explicit or implicit \u2014 of a single mind, however brilliant. Socialist ethics is the spirit of the entire workers' movement, of the socialist movement as a whole. To confuse it with the work or thought of a single individual is to betray the impersonal spirit of the ethic of the workers' movement.\n\nSocialist humanism is the ethic of revolution and utopia. Socialism is a historical necessity only insofar as it is thought of and willed as an ethical necessity. This is what Marx meant when he posed the dilemma: \u201cThe proletariat is revolutionary or it is nothing!\u201d And we add, to give socialist ethics its full meaning: socialism is utopian consciousness or it is nothing."
