        "article_content": "When a Long Island-based UFO enthusiast named John Ford suspected that the government might be concealing information regarding a UFO crash landing, he resorted to some extreme lengths to ensure that the alleged truth about the existence of aliens prevailed. The chairman of LIUFON is the focus of the episode titled \u2018Lights Over Long Island\u2019 of Hulu\u2019s \u2018Out There: Crimes of the Paranormal.\u2019 It also features interviews with his associates, generating several questions regarding his well-being and current whereabouts.\n\nJohn Ford is Accused of Plotting to Murder Three Government Officials\n\nA big believer in UFOs, John Ford founded the Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON) in order to conduct studies related to the unknown and prove the existence of aliens through research and evidence. He and other members of LIUFON believed that a UFO had crash-landed in South Haven Park near the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the government officials were hiding them in the laboratory. When his research was constantly interrupted by the actions of the government, he reportedly devised a plan to kill three representatives \u2014 Anthony Gazzola, a leader of the Conservative Party in Brookhaven; John Powell, the chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee; and Fred Towle, a Suffolk legislator.\n\nHis plan involved putting radium in each of their car seats and mixing radioactive metal into their toothpaste, leading to them contracting fatal diseases. Not only that, reports suggested that he also had plans to set fire to the Suffolk Republican headquarters and promote Conservative Party politicians. When law enforcement learned about this conspiracy, they arrested John Ford in June 1996 and charged with three counts of second-degree criminal solicitation, three counts of second-degree conspiracy to commit murder, and one count of illegal possession of radioactive materials.\n\nUpon searching his property, they reportedly discovered five lead canisters containing the radioactive element radium, hand grenades, a mine detector, militia literature, ammunition, and around 50 handguns and rifles. Deeming him delusional, and thus, unfit for trial in 1997, John J. Ford was instead sent to the Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center in New Hampton, New York. About three years after his arrest, in 1999, the accused pleaded not responsible by reason of insanity.\n\nJohn Ford Seemingly Remains Admitted to a Mental Institution\n\nIn 2019, the retired court security officer from Bellport, John Ford, won a transfer order that allowed him to be released from a secure psychiatric hospital and admitted to a less restrictive one. Supreme Court Justice Elaine Zaritsky Slobod was of the opinion that John was not a danger to himself or anyone around him despite still being mentally ill. Along with her, his attorneys \u2014 Steven Metcalf II and Nanette Ida Metcalf \u2014 also spoke for their client, claiming that his mental health might improve if he is allowed to be in a less restrictive environment.\n\nIn Nanette\u2019s opinion, the significance of the conspiracy charges against him was the only reason John was kept confined in a mental institution for so many years. However, in 2019, she claimed that the Chairman of the Long Island UFO Network was \u201cvery competent, capable, calm.\u201d Around Christmas day in 2022, he was in good health and getting ready to return to court, fighting for his unsupervised privileges within the following few months.\n\nRead More: Tobias Wayland: Where is the Paranormal Investigator Now?"

I research unconventional aircraft engineered from a planet not ours. Extraterrestrials visiting Earth are airbrushed out to remove this alien activity evidence. An officer with Eisenhower, who was then a colonel, saw debris.\n\n\u201cA NASA researcher saw dark side of the moon photos showing triangular spacecraft on a crater\u2019s edge. NASA airbrushed that out saying ETs don\u2019t want us exploring their bases.\n\n\u201cNASA chiefs said that was to be an actual covered-up alien attack on us.\n\n\u201cUFO hunters \u2014 involved in government and society \u2014 claim these aliens are us \u2014 the next civilization. They look like us because they are us. We migrate as DNA on asteroids and comets. Spinning in that water is our bacteria and DNA. If it\u2019s a hospitable planet, life takes place.\n\nBeam them up\n\n\u201cThousands have been contacted. Abducted. They are tracked by UFOs. John Lennon saw bright light, then little creatures who gave him an egg-shaped object. He gave it to his psychic friend Uri Geller. That device is still in Tel Aviv.\n\n\u201cI know three underwater bases. Gulf of Mexico fishermen see bright lights under Florida and Cuba. Another in LA County near Santa Catalina. Also a major base off Malibu.\n\n\u201cPresident Bill Clinton investigated Roswell. A retired general knew of Roswell debris. Strom Thurmond took it to defense contractors to reverse engineer it. Technology was integrated circuitry and Kevlar lasers. A NASA technician airbrushed them out saying, \u2018There\u2019s no spacecraft on the moon.\u2019\n\n\u201cETs have a base on the moon they want kept secret. NASA guys say we covered up an actual alien attack on us. UFO hunters say we have met ET and it is us. A whole civilization was on this planet.\n\nThe space race\n\n\u201cFour million years ago as this solar system formed, chunks of Mars landed on the newly formed North Pole. Life formed. Comets brought more bacteria. These creatures developed and they\u2019re us.\u201d\n\nBirnes, a NY Times best-selling author about the days following Roswell, said: \u201cI\u2019m told ETs throughout our government exercise higher security than the president. They track those who believe they have UFO parentage someplace.\u201d\n\nFalling into festival mode\n\nFOR this world, the 62nd NY Film Festival\u2019s running Friday to Oct. 14. To babble: Elton John, Daniel Craig, Selena Gomez, Zoe Saldana, Naomi Watts, Bill Murray, Angelina Jolie, Kieran Culkin, Jennifer Grey, Emma Stone, Cate Blanchett. Opening Oct. 4 is the 32nd Hamptons thing. Schlepping over: Liev Schreiber, Demi Moore, Alec Baldwin, Andrew Garfield, Denzel\u2019s son Malcolm.\n\nSo damn exciting I\u2019m going to lay down my darning.\n\nIF this isn\u2019t enough excitement, movie producers will be manufacturing inflatable sheep for lonely widows (and columnists).\n\nOnly in New York, kids, only in New York."

For instance, we recently happened upon a free AI web app called AirFry.AI that does one thing really well.\n\nAs the name suggests, this free tool is an AI assistant that helps you cook food in your air fryer. While air fryers are popular in part because they are so easy to use, they can require some trial and error when it comes to cooking times and temperatures for food. As such, you might end up scouring the web to find out how long to cook fries or chicken wings, and if you\u2019ve ever visited a recipe site, you know how far you have to scroll for the information you need.\n\nAirFry.AI is a useful and free AI tool. Image source: AirFry.AI\n\nAirFry.AI removes all of the hassle and tells you precisely what you need to know. Input the food you\u2019re trying to cook, choose between \u00b0C and \u00b0F, and click the \u201cAir Fry\u201d button. When I searched for \u201cfrozen tater tots,\u201d this was the answer: \u201cCook frozen tater tots in an air fryer at 400\u00b0F for 15-20 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through cooking. Enjoy your crispy tater tots!\u201d\n\nNo long-winded videos or lengthy stories about the author\u2019s great-great-grandmother\u2019s original tater tots from the 1800s. Just a simple, precise answer.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nYou can also click on the toggle at the top of the page to switch to recipes. These responses are often longer and more detailed, providing a list of ingredients and a numbered set of instructions. When I searched for \u201cgarlic chicken wings,\u201d AirFry.AI told me how much of each spice to include as well as instructions for mixing, marinating, preheating, and cooking.\n\nObviously, you could use ChatGPT or any other generative AI chatbot for similar purposes, but having it all set up ahead of time makes it less overwhelming."

        "article_content": "A pair of paranormal investigators have shared five key signs your home might be haunted.\n\nOkay, yeah, not all of us believe in ghosts and spirits, or even just the paranormal in general - but there\u2019s a whole load of people who truly do and let\u2019s be honest, we\u2019ve all had that weird kind of feeling that we\u2019re being watched or that we\u2019re not really alone.\n\nYou know, the creepy chill there\u2019s something unexplained happening.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd LADbible spoke to Help! My House is Haunted presenters Barri Ghai and Jayne Harris about what we can look out for around the house that could mean we\u2019re the subject of a \u2018classic haunting\u2019.\n\nBarri Ghai and Jayne Harris on Help! My House is Haunted (Discovery+)\n\nTemperature Changes\n\nInvestigator and technical expert Ghai explains this is a \u2018common\u2019 sign or symptom of a haunting.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cPeople have inexplicable cold spots around their home, regardless of how much heating is on or whether doors and windows are closed,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe Unexplained\n\nHistorian and psychologist Harris advises keeping an ear and an eye out for the little unexplained things in your home.\n\nTypically, we all know which floorboards or steps in our home creek when we step on them, so if you hear that squeak while you\u2019re not there, \u2018you know that is unexplained, you know there\u2019s something there\u2019.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cGo with your gut instinct,\u201d she says. \u201cLook out for the little things. Often people will find things go missing or things move, and they will find them in places where they know they\u2019ve looked.\u201d\n\nGhai says to watch out for temperature changes (Discovery+)\n\nThe Feeling of Being Watched\n\n\u201cSometimes people walk around their own homes,\u201d Ghai says. \u201cEven though it\u2019s their stuff, they feel like they\u2019re trespassing. And then they feel that they have eyes on them.\u201d\n\nAdvert\n\nIn this case, he says to trust yourself because \u2018the human body is the best paranormal detector\u2019.\n\nCorner of the Eye Spots\n\nSimilarly, Harris says while we are \u2018very perceptive\u2019, we\u2019ll often just \u2018try and explain things away\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re sat watching the TV one night, and you think you've just seen someone walk past the door, a lot of people would just be like \u2018it\u2019s nothing\u2019,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut if it happens again on a separate occasion, it could be something.\n\nAdvert\n\n\u201cTrust yourself, trust your instincts. You know your house, you know when things don't feel quite right.\u201d\n\nHarris advises to try and be logical (Discovery+)\n\nAnomalous Sounds\n\nGhai says this one crops \u2018up time and time again\u2019 in cases he sees where people hear everything from \u2018whispering and chatting to actual spoken words\u2019.\n\n\u201cOr in the more sinister cases, someone whose voice is familiar to you,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s that mimicking sound - so your mum calling your name, but your mum's not there.\n\n\u201cThat kind of thing that happens a lot.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t just assume it\u2019s a haunting\n\nWhile all of these can be classed as key signs of a haunting by the pros, obviously, you do need to rationalise as Harris says you shouldn\u2019t just \u2018assume\u2019 that\u2019s what it means.\n\n\u201cCheck for the logical things,\u201d she advises, urging to double check that windows are closed and the radiator\u2019s working if you get those cold spots.\n\n\u201cBecause it's only when you rule out all of those logical explanations that you're left with potentially a paranormal case,\u201d Harris adds.\n\nBut she does warn that once you\u2019re properly suspicious there is something in your house you should get \u2018professional advice\u2019.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try and communicate with whatever you think might be there if you're not experienced in doing it, because it can make things worse,\u201d she warns.\n\nSpooky.\n\nSeries six of Help! My House is Haunted airs on Really, Fridays at 9pm. It\u2019s also available to stream on Discovery+."

        "article_content": "Books about haunted houses fly off library shelves this time of year. For patrons who want a possibly more hair-raising experience, libraries have stepped into the realm of the supernatural: many now lend out ghost-hunting kits, complete with instructions on how to use the equipment. The kits are so popular, they seem to disappear.\n\nKaz Windness was at her local library in Thornton, Colo. recently when such a kit caught her eye near the checkout counter.\n\nWindness, a children\u2019s book author and illustrator, said she was intrigued, even though as far as she knew, there were not any ghosts in her home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering spooky season, so I decided to give it a try,\u201d she said about Halloween time.\n\nWindness checked out the kit and took it home so she and her two teenagers could experiment with it.\n\nAlthough the kits don\u2019t include advice on how to hunt for ghosts, library customers can find a treasure trove of tips on paranormal websites.\n\nWindness put some water to boil on her stove to test out the thermometer, which paranormal investigators use to detect temperature changes in places said to be haunted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere were no ghosts in my teapot,\u201d she said with a laugh. She then tried out the spirit box \u2014 a radio scanner that has a slight modification enabling it to rapidly scan multiple AM or FM stations at once to pick up voices in the static or white noise. Paranormal investigators say that ghosts and spirits tend to communicate through radio transmissions.\n\n\u201cI hit the scan button and asked, \u2018Who\u2019s here? What\u2019s your name?\u2019 and I clearly heard the name Artemus,\u201d Windness said, explaining that the scanner had picked up a radio frequency where somebody said the name.\n\n\u201cSo who knows?\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s actually something to it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerican Libraries Magazine recently reported on the popularity of ghost-hunting kits, which usually contain equipment worth about $250 and can be checked out for a week at a time by patrons age 18 and older.\n\nOhio\u2019s Clark County Public Library is one of the latest libraries to get into the spirit, with three kits in circulation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d heard about other libraries having lots of success with their ghost-hunting kits, so we decided in 2023 to also give them a try,\u201d said Allison Peck, public relations manager for the library in Springfield.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been checking out consistently well and we always have holds on them, but one is currently MIA,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe a ghost took it?\u201d\n\nAt the Coventry Public Library in Coventry, R.I., the staff put together a promotional video that shows a couple of librarians wandering around the book stacks in the dark while using a spirit-detecting kit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough nothing spooky turned up, one of the librarians took the kit home and used it while taking images on her phone, said library director Lauren Walker. The librarian claimed that when she looked at the photos, she saw an image of an unknown man sitting on her couch.\n\n\u201cIt confirmed her hunch that her house was haunted,\u201d Walker said.\n\nWalker said the library\u2019s ghost-hunting kit is among the top requested items in a \u201cLibrary of Things\u201d that also includes an inflatable kayak, a telescope, ukuleles, dinosaur cake pans and kits for metal detecting and showing outdoor movies.\n\n\u201cLibraries aren\u2019t just a place to borrow books,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy buy something like a ghost-hunting kit when you can borrow it?\u201d\n\nThe Coventry Public Library\u2019s version of the kit includes a geophone to detect vibrations, footsteps and moving objects, Walker said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGhost hunting gets a lot of attention at Halloween, but our kit is pretty much in demand year-round,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that parents like to check out for a fun weekend with their kids.\u201d\n\nIn Evansville, Wisc., the Eager Free Public Library\u2019s popular spirit-detecting kit keeps disappearing from the shelves, said Rebecca Van Dan, the library\u2019s assistant director and head of youth services.\n\n\u201cI added some books to the kit about haunted locations in Wisconsin, and people seem to enjoy taking it around to try it out,\u201d she said, adding that one of those haunted locations is rumored to be the Eager Free Public Library.\n\n\u201cOur library was built in the early 1900s by Almeron Eager, whose statue has a place of honor in the old part of the building,\u201d Van Dan said. \u201cOne of our employees is into ghosts, and when she tried out the kit, she said she picked up lots of cold readings near the statue.\u201d Her thermometer\u2019s readings were low, she said, which according to ghost hunters, might indicate spirits are nearby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ghost-hunting kit is now almost as popular as the library\u2019s knitting kit and 3D doodler, Van Dan said.\n\nWindness, 49, said she enjoyed using her library\u2019s kit at her Colorado home so much that she\u2019s now thinking of checking it out again when a friend comes for a weekend visit.\n\nWhile her kids Kara, 16, and Max, 14, enjoyed goofing around with the kit, they ultimately decided it wasn\u2019t cool enough for teenagers, she said.\n\n\u201cMy kids were saying, \u2018skibidi toilet!\u2019 into the voice recorder,\u201d Windness said, translating that the term means gross or dumb in teen speak.\n\nShe said she enjoyed hearing the voices of people in her community who used the digital voice recorder and didn\u2019t erase their recordings.\n\n\u201cYou turn it on and you hear kids and their parents laughing and having fun,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Hello, is anyone here? Are there any ghosts here with us?\u2019\u201d"

The group will be among those appearing in Thunder Bay, at the Lake Superior Paranormal Convention, in October. (Submitted by SNIPE) Load Image\n\nGhosts, Sasquatch, unidentified aerial phenomena \u2014 a convention taking place in Thunder Bay next month has all the paranormal bases covered.\n\nThe first-ever Lake Superior Paranormal Convention kicks off on Oct. 4.\n\n\"I think it's going to be awesome,\" said Gail Willis, convention organizer and member of Thunder Bay ghost hunting group Lucky Paranormal (external link)\n\n\"We're super excited about doing it,\" she said. \"It really is for people who love the paranormal, are interested in the paranormal, might have stories to share. And this will be like a safe space, and an open place, for people to share their stories, talk about UFOs, Sasquatch, spirits, and any of their experiences.\"\n\n\"And also for skeptics, too.\"\n\nScience writer Chris Rutkowski, known as \"Canada's UFO guy\" will be one of the speakers.\n\n\"I've been at this for quite some time,\" he said in an interview with CBC News. \"Back in the 1970s, I was taking my astronomy degree at University of Manitoba, and there had been a lot of UFOs being seen across Canada at that time, and I was curious.\"\n\n\"My profs didn't think much of UFOs at all, but that gave me more incentive to try and understand them a little bit more, so I started talking with people,\" he said. \"I went to their homes out in the community and farms and other places, and found that most people were simply not making stories up. They were just seeing things that they couldn't understand, they couldn't explain. And in most cases, I could explain what people were seeing as stars and planets and planets and whatever.\"\n\n\"But there were a couple of cases that were very, very curious and I couldn't understand what those things were either.\"\n\nRutkowski said he was eventually asked to give a presentation on the phenomenon at his university, which led to more opportunities to write and speak about the subject.\n\nHe's since published several books - the most-recent of which is 2022's Canada's UFOs: Declassified - and will give a talk titled Canada's Unseen Skies and Thunder Bay's Unexplained UFO Mysteries at the convention.\n\n\"Things have changed to a great degree,\" he said. \"There's a lot of scientists around the world now who are taking the subject of UAP very seriously \u2014 they don't call them UFO's because of the stigma.\"\n\n\"There's projects such as the Galileo project, in the United States, which is developing observatories dedicated to looking for UFOs in the sky and detecting them and in many other ways,\" he said. \"There are scientists who are, you know, taking the subject seriously enough to write and publish papers in peer-reviewed journals.\"\n\n\"As long as the subject is actually what people are seeing and not necessarily the interpretation, it's all fair game. But once you start talking about whether aliens are really here, and they're walking among us and they're abducting people and they're taking him on board for flights to and from Venus and places like that, that's where you get into some difficulty, because there's no proof of that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the team of investigators of the TV show Beyond the Haunting will be holding a talk titled Breaking the Paranormal Mold.\n\n\"I think the one thing that we like to bring to the table is the fact that you don't see a lot of all-female teams in the paranormal,\" said team member Corine Carey. \"So that's one of the first big ones.\"\n\n\"We've had ability since we were kids, we've had experiences that we can't explain, we've grown up trying to figure out what the heck is going on.\"\n\n\"Now that we're adults and we're accepting all this, and we're out there doing this and sharing our stories, we just want people to also understand that not everything's paranormal, but when there is stuff going on out there, we experience it too.\"\n\n\"So come talk with us, come chat with us. We want to hear your experiences.\"\n\nThe team will also be participating in the Saturday night ghost hunt at the museum.\n\n\"We have not been in there,\" Beyond the Haunting's Leanne Sallenback said. \"It'll be a first-time investigation for us too.\"\n\n\"They're going to get all the initial and raw reactions from us, and if any spirits or ghosts want to come communicate with us, in addition to our gear, we'll also be leaning into whatever abilities are surfacing in that moment. So we hope to kind of maybe uncover something that hasn't yet been discovered.\"\n\nThe main convention will take place on Saturday, Oct. 5 from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the Prince Arthur hotel.\n\nIn addition to the vendors, movie screenings, workshops, the convention will involve several guest speakers. They include:"

Thanks to some suggestive fossils and legends of old, talk of such a creature isn\u2019t a new concept. But the recent discovery of 200-year-old rock paintings found in South Africa now has scientists hypothesizing that this ancient creature may have been far more than just a legend.\n\nThe first formal scientific descriptions of this horned serpent\u2014a supposed member of the dicynodont group\u2014appeared in 1845. Considering the abundance of dicynodont fossils found in the Karoo Basin in South Africa, some have pondered whether this long-thought mythical horned serpent is rooted in reality. The discovery of rock art dated to between 1821 and 1835 adds even more credence to the legend, as the painting is older than the first formal reference to the dicynodont. If we\u2019re lucky, it could provide further clues as to just how intertwined this horned serpent was with South Africa\u2019s indigenous San culture.\n\nRelated Story Oldest Known Cave Paintings Show Hunting Myths\n\nIn a study published in the journal PLOS ONE, Julien Benoit from the University of the Witwatersrand confirmed that the rock art from the early 1800s depicts a tusked animal, and that it sits alongside tetrapod fossils in the immediate vicinity. \u201cAltogether,\u201d the Benoit wrote, \u201cthey suggest a case of indigenous paleontology.\u201d\n\nStill, it will need to take more than a 200-year-old painting to match a smattering of unknown fossils to a long-extinct creature unlike anything seen in the area today. \u201cThe ethnographic, archaeological, and paleontological evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that the Horned Serpent panel could possibly depict a dicynodont,\u201d Benoit wrote in the study. He added that the downward orientation of the tusks, which doesn\u2019t match any African animal (but does match dicynodonts), the abundance of fossils in the area, and the belief held by the San of the existence of this long-extinct large animal further support the theory.\n\n\u201cOf course, at this point it is speculative,\u201d said Benoit, according to IFL Science, \u201cbut the tusked animal on the Horned Serpent panel was likely painted as a rain-animal, which means it was probably involved [in] rain-making ceremonies.\u201d These ceremonies often evoked known extinct animals to help the people encourage the gods to send rain.\n\nRelated Story Fossilized Finds Buried Under L.A. High School\n\nThe San were known to have a robust mix of animals belonging to their \u2018spirit world,\u2019 but Benoit said that these animals were generally inspired by reality\u2014even if extinct. Coupled with the San\u2019s interest in fossils, Benoit believes a fossil discovery could have led the San to recreate the horned serpent, using a long-held legend in which their ancestors described the creatures as \u201cgreat monstrous brutes, exceeding the elephant or hippopotamus in bulk\u201d as the template.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of leaps from legend to scientific grounding that may be too large for a fabled horned serpent to make. But after further studies, the 200-year-old paintings could spin a different tale."

        "article_content": "Vertigo3d/Getty Images\n\nToday's average large enterprise is likely to have nearly 80,000 apps built out of copilots and low-code platforms. This is posing a potential security nightmare, as more than six out of ten, 62%, have security vulnerabilities, a recent study finds.\n\n\n\nThe study released by Zenity finds that enterprise copilots and low-code development are seeing 40% year-to-year growth in the use of these tools. The study is based on data surveyed and gathered from large organizations, but the implications are just as applicable to small to medium-sized businesses. Currently, the typical enterprise customer in the study has an average of 79,602 apps built across various copilots and low-code platforms. By comparison, the study's authors estimate that the average large enterprise has at least 473 SaaS-based apps.\n\nAlso: The line between citizen developers and IT pros gets fuzzier - is that a problem?\n\nThe study's authors define \"copilots\" as the range of no-code and low-code tools and platforms including Microsoft Copilot, Power Platform, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zapier, OpenAI, and more. The average large organization has about seven copilot and low-code platforms in use, they estimate.\n\nAmong the 80,000 apps and copilots developed outside of the traditional software development lifecycle are roughly 50,000 vulnerabilities, the study concludes. The main risk cited is \"business users having the ability to build apps and copilots without needing a coding background and without proper security guardrails in place,\" the study's authors note. The top technical risks seen with copilot and low-code platforms include authorization misuse, authentication failures, and data and secrets handling, the study finds.\n\n\"In traditional application development, apps are carefully built throughout the software development lifecycle, where each app is continuously planned, designed, implemented, measured, and analyzed,\" they explain. \"In modern business application development, however, no such checks and balances exists and a new form of shadow IT emerges.\"\n\nWithin the range of copilot solutions \"anyone can build and access powerful business apps and copilots that access, transfer, and store sensitive data and contribute to critical business operations with just a couple clicks of the mouse or use of natural language text prompts,\" the study cautions. \"The velocity and magnitude of this new wave of application development creates a new and vast attack surface.\"\n\nAlso: The data suggests gen AI boosts software productivity - for these developers\n\nMany enterprises encouraging copilot and low-code development are \"not fully embracing that they need to contextualize and understand not only how many apps and copilots are being built, but also the business context such as what data the app interacts with, who it is intended for, and what business function it is meant to accomplish.\"\n\nAs a result, \"there are a lot of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that are hard to contextualize and sort out who needs to do what to mitigate risk.\"\n\nUntrusted guest access via copilot and low-code apps is another issue. \"The average enterprise in the study has over 8,641 instances of untrusted guest users having access to apps that are developed via copilots and low-code,\" the study shows. More than 72% of those cases \"provide privileged access to untrusted guests; meaning unmonitored and unmanaged guests can create, modify, or delete these apps.\"\n\nAlso: Code faster with generative AI, but beware the risks when you do\n\nHere are some of the steps the study's authors recommend to address these vulnerabilities:\n\nConfigure for security up front: Ensure that controls are in place \"to flag any app that contains a hard-coded secret or insecure step in how it retrieves credentials,\" they urge. \"Contextualize apps that are being built to ensure that critical business apps that also come into contact with sensitive internal data have proper authentication controls. Once this is done, ensuring that proper authentication is in place for apps that require access to sensitive data is a top priority.\"\n\nEnsure that controls are in place \"to flag any app that contains a hard-coded secret or insecure step in how it retrieves credentials,\" they urge. \"Contextualize apps that are being built to ensure that critical business apps that also come into contact with sensitive internal data have proper authentication controls. Once this is done, ensuring that proper authentication is in place for apps that require access to sensitive data is a top priority.\" Establish guardrails: \"Due to the nature of copilots and AI in general, strict guardrails need to be in place in order to prevent oversharing apps, unnecessarily bridging access to sensitive data via AI, sharing end user interactions with copilots, and more. Without them, enterprises are staring down increased risks for malicious prompt injection and data leakage.\"\n\n\"Due to the nature of copilots and AI in general, strict guardrails need to be in place in order to prevent oversharing apps, unnecessarily bridging access to sensitive data via AI, sharing end user interactions with copilots, and more. Without them, enterprises are staring down increased risks for malicious prompt injection and data leakage.\" Regulate guest access: Guest users \"are held to different security standards as full-time employees yet still possess privileged access to apps and copilots built across low-code platforms,\" the study's authors point out. It's critical to \"limit application and copilot access to only who needs them in order to perform their respective duties.\"\n\nGuest users \"are held to different security standards as full-time employees yet still possess privileged access to apps and copilots built across low-code platforms,\" the study's authors point out.

        "article_content": "The 2024 fantasy football season has been one of the most unpredictable of all-time. Who could've guessed that Jauan Jennings would break out for three touchdowns in one game after having only scored two over the last two years? We've seen a myriad of unprecedented performances already, both good and bad, and that makes trying to pick the correct players to start in your fantasy lineup incredibly difficult.\n\nCole Kmet earned 10 receptions on your bench? You really going to start him now? Jahmyr Gibbs earned fewer carries and less passing work than David Montgomery? Is that going to happen every week? James Conner only had one reception against Detroit? Will he get more involved in the Cardinals' aerial attack? There are a lot of questions that don't have solid answers heading into Week 4, but the most reliable source of information is still the matchup.\n\nHere are eight players to start in Week 4 and eight more to sit.\n\nWant to win your fantasy league?Sign up for The Huddle\n\nPlayers to start in Week 4:\n\nQuarterbacks:\n\nJustin Fields, PIT\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nOver the last two weeks, the Indianapolis Colts have allowed the Green Bay Packers to run all over them and allowed Caleb Williams to put up 17 fantasy points. Now, they make like Miley Cyrus and get the best of both worlds: a mobile former Chicago Bear. The Indy defense is having a very difficult time stopping the run, and as it stands, Justin Fields has had no trouble scoring touchdowns with his feet. It would not be shocking to see Fields trot into the endzone again this weekend.\n\nBaker Mayfield, TB\n\nPrior to Week 3, the Philadelphia Eagles' defense was getting carved up left and right. Baker Mayfield and the Bucs are going to be playing with a massive chip on their shoulders after losing to the Denver Broncos by nearly 20 points. Furthermore, Eagles' cornerback Darius Slay sustained an injury during their win over New Orleans. That should give Mayfield far more options if Slay is unable to suit up.\n\nRunning Backs:\n\nNajee Harris, PIT\n\nFor all the same reasons as Fields, Harris is a great play this week. While the Bears' D'Andre Swift may have struggled on the ground in Week 3, the Colts' gameplan likely revolved around limiting the Bears' ground attack and forcing Caleb Williams to beat them. While they could employ a similar strategy against Pittsburgh, the Steelers' offense has proven more capable of pushing the ball downfield than Chicago. That plan would likely backfire. Harris is the clear-cut RB1 in Pittsburgh, and that's enough to feast when playing Indianapolis.\n\nBucky Irving, TB\n\nIf there was ever a time for Irving to officially overtake Rachaad White on the Bucs' depth chart, it would be now. A week after outcarrying White for the first time, the Bucs now face one of the worst run defenses in the NFL. While the Buccaneers may still be inclined to start White in this game, any hint of ineffectiveness or any sort of early deficit should give Irving a larger role.\n\nRhamondre Stevenson, NE\n\nThe 49ers' defense has shown its true form this year. They cannot stop the run. Three straight weeks now, running backs have scored at least one touchdown, and while New England is the least effective offense the Niners have faced so far, the Niners' run defense should be bet against until they can prove otherwise.\n\nWide Receivers:\n\nDiontae Johnson, CAR\n\nWith the Bryce Young experiment over in Carolina, the Panthers' offense took massive leaps forward against Las Vegas. Even better, Diontae Johnson emerged as the clear-cut WR1, especially with Adam Thielen battling injury. Although the Bengals have not been bad against wide receivers on the season, this should be a much closer game than the Panthers experienced in Week 3, which could mean even more targets for Johnson, and he had 14 on Sunday.\n\nTight Ends:\n\nZach Ertz, WSH\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals are and have long been atrocious at defending against tight ends. While they have shown signs of improvement this year, limiting both Dalton Kincaid and Colby Parkinson through two weeks, they took a step back toward the norm in Week 3.\n\nEven after Detroit's Sam LaPorta left Sunday's game with injury, the Lions' backup tight end Brock Wright still racked up four receptions and 34 yards. With how horrendous the tight end position has been in fantasy this year, even a 7.4 PPR performance would be worth starting at this point. Ertz has been one of quarterback Jayden Daniels' favorite targets early on. He'll likely surpass that total.\n\nJake Ferguson, DAL\n\nMuch like the Arizona Cardinals, the New York Giants have not been good against tight ends to start the year. Even with David Njoku out in Week 3, the Giants still surrendered seven targets and four receptions to Jordan Akins. Ferguson is fresh off an 11-target outing against Baltimore. While that type of workload should not be expected, Ferguson should have a sizable role against New York.\n\nPlayers to sit in Week 4:\n\nQuarterbacks:\n\nGeno Smith, SEA\n\nThe Detroit Lions have suddenly turned into one of the most complete defenses in the NFL this year. Kyler Murray had been playing spectacularly heading into Week 2, but he was held in check by Detroit's defense on Sunday. Geno Smith is in the same boat. He may be playing well, but Detroit seems to be a momentum-stopper at the moment. Even in their lone loss of the season to Tampa Bay, Baker Mayfield was held to 185 yards and only one touchdown.\n\nAnthony Richardson, IND\n\nRichardson has been a massive disappointment to start the 2024 season, and if you were hoping he'd turn it around in Week 4, a matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers would beg to differ. Pittsburgh's defense looks like one of the best in the NFL early on, and until Richardson proves capable of completing difficult passes, he's not worth putting in your starting lineups.\n\nRunning Backs:\n\nKenneth Walker/Zach Charbonnet, SEA\n\nIt's still unclear whether or not Kenneth Walker will be available in Week 4, but regardless of who the Seahawks are starting at running back this weekend, you should not start them. The Pittsburgh defense just held J.K. Dobbins to his worst performance of the season, just 44 yards on 15 carries. A week prior, they limited Javonte Williams and Jaleel McLaughlin to 23 yards on 14 carries. In Week 1, they held Bijan Robinson to under four yards a carry.\n\nIt's clear the Steelers know how to prevent teams from pushing the ball downfield on the ground. Even if Walker is healthy, the Seahawks will likely face similar struggles.\n\nJ.K. Dobbins, LAC\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers will face the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 4, and if there is one thing the Chiefs are good at, it's preventing teams from getting strong performances from their top offensive options. In Week 1, Mark Andrews was irrelevant. In Week 2, Ja'Marr Chase was held in check. In Week 3, Bijan Robinson's impact was minimalized.\n\nThe Chargers clearly love Dobbins, and while he is talented, he's not talented enough to overcome a defensive gameplan designed to stop him.\n\nWide Receivers:\n\nCourtland Sutton, DEN\n\nSutton may be coming off his best performance of the year, but one decent week from Bo Nix isn't enough to start Sutton with confidence, especially with the Broncos set to take on the New York Jets in Week 4. Sutton will likely be shadowed by Sauce Gardner, which means Sutton is in for a quiet day.\n\nTyreek Hill, MIA\n\nIt hurts to say, but until Tua Tagovailoa returns, the Miami wide receivers are probably not worth starting, but that is especially true in Week 4 when the Dolphins play the Tennessee Titans. L'Jarius Sneed has been spectacular for Tennessee, holding Garrett Wilson to less than 60 yards in Week 2 and holding DJ Moore to under 40 yards in Week 1. Hill has the explosiveness to take any pass to the house, and let's be real, there's no world where you are benching your first-round pick, but if you have a deep team, and can afford it, it's definitely a move you should consider.\n\nMichael Pittman Jr., IND\n\nThis isn't just a move to make in Week 4. This is a move for the foreseeable future. Through three weeks, Pittman has recorded just 11 receptions and 88 yards. His connection with quarterback Anthony Richardson has just not developed like we had hoped. Furthermore, a matchup with the daunted Steelers' defense does not bode well for a breakout this weekend.\n\nTight Ends:\n\nCole Kmet, CHI\n\nComing off a 10-reception performance, Kmet may be an enticing play in Week 4, but should Keenan Allen return this weekend, Kmet will be a massive bust. Allen and Kmet serve similar roles in the Chicago passing game, and prior to Allen's injury, he'd earned 11 targets in just one game.\n\nSo long as Allen is out, Kmet could be worth a start, but with Allen likely to return this weekend, Kmet will see his workload drop significantly.\n\nFantasy football waiver wire Week 4:5 players you need to consider picking up"
