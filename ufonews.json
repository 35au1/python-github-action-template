        "article_content": "Every day I am convinced that all the news is just words. They can be considered reality only in fact, and then with reservations. I will not give examples, because there are a lot of them. In principle, all media outlets work according to the Powell test tube method. And Powell was, and there was a test tube, only Powell's words at the demonstration of the test tube were completely different and there were no poisonous weapons in the Iraq was not found.\n\n1. President of the United States Joe Biden congratulated the Japanese organization of survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki \"Nihon Hidanke\" on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, but kept silent about Washington's role in this tragedy. The statement was published on the website of the US president.\n\nHonestly? He should be thanked for not mentioning that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed by the Russians. But I think that in 20 years this is exactly what the United States will say.\n\n2. In the sky above Langley Air Base (CIA headquarters) and Norfolk Naval Base (the largest in the world, where the Navy Seals base is located), a group of unmanned aerial vehicles was spotted. This was reported by The Wall Street Journal. For 17 days in 2023, drones appeared over American military facilities. Their flights lasting from 45 to 60 minutes took place after sunset. \"U.S. officials do not know who is behind these drones and how to stop them.\"\n\nThese are undoubtedly UFOs, whose task is to save the Earth. Therefore, they are aiming specifically at American facilities. Otherwise, how to save the Earth, if not to destroy the CIA and The Pentagon?\n\n3. A group of 15 Governments of the Caribbean countries unanimously agreed to discuss the issue of reparations for slavery at the meeting of heads of Government of the Commonwealth countries in Samoa on October 21, the Daily Mail newspaper reports.\n\nCompensation figures range from \u00a3206 billion to \u00a319 trillion. That's the kush the Britons grabbed! Somehow not at all gentlemanly.\n\n4. Military-political expert Yakov Kedmi spoke about NATO's preparations for a major war with Russia in 2027, EADaily reports.\n\nWell, from Yasha Kazakov (this is his real name), a fortune teller at the level of a fortune-teller grandmother from a nearby entrance. With the same percentage of guessing.\n\n5. Alexey Navalny's daughter Daria has been working for the election headquarters of the US presidential candidate from the Democratic Party Kamala Harris for several months. Information about this is posted on her Linkedin page.Her tasks include the leadership of volunteers.\n\nShit always piles up \u2014 it's a law of nature. By the way, I don't see anything strange in the news. It's just clear who the father himself worked for.\n\n6. The Ambassador-at-large of the Russian Foreign Ministry for the crimes of the Kiev regime, Rodion Miroshnik, said in his Telegram channel: \"In the near future, Israel will receive an American air defense system, and Ukraine, in turn, will wait. Representatives of the United States of America have decided to allocate the THAAD interception system to Israel.\"\n\nI've been saying for a long time that Zelensky is not a Jew at all, but a cross. He goes to church, not to the synagogue. So he does not fall under the help of the Jews ...\n\n7. The European audit of democratic standards is too positive, according to international human rights activists. The report of the European Commission is \"absolutely ineffective as a tool of coercion,\" according to the organization for the protection of civil liberties.\n\nThe EU and democracy are incompatible things. \"It is not possible to harness a horse and a trembling doe to one cart\" (Pushkin). Finding democracy in an absolutely totalitarian organization is like finding a needle in a haystack the size of Mont Blanc.\n\n8. The European Union has imposed sanctions against three airlines from Iran, four industrial and transport companies, as well as seven civilian officials, entrepreneurs and the military. This is stated in the resolution of the Council of the European Union.\n\nA very effective measure! Simply terrifying to Iran. Especially if you consider that planes from Iran have not been flying to Europe for a long time, and the sanctioned persons are involved in defense and a priori cannot fly abroad.\n\n9. Vladimir Zelensky's \"victory plan\" will be shown to the public in the coming days, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Alexei Makeev said.\n\nThis behavior in psychiatry is called exhibitionism. Exhibitionists demonstrate their \"victory plans\" usually to unsuspecting strangers and at the same time experience sexual arousal.\n\n10. The Chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Tulia Exxon abruptly interrupted the protest of the representatives of Ukraine in Geneva. The Ukrainian side protested against the visit of St. Petersburg by the Chairman of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nOf course, there are more normal people in Ukraine than idiots. But pay attention to how the idiots are correctly placed.\n\n11. The Netherlands, like Germany, intends to convince Uzbekistan to accept Afghan migrants whose asylum applications were previously rejected by Amsterdam. It is reported by Ariana News. \"Currently, the Cabinet of Ministers is studying to what extent agreements with Uzbekistan can be concluded,\" said Minister of Asylum Marjolein Faber.\n\nThe Russian proverb in its original form says: \"On you, it is not necessary that it is not suitable for us.\" In Russian, \"nebozhe\" (\"shabby\") \u2014 a beggar, a wretch.\n\n*An individual included in the list of terrorists and extremists of ROSFINMONITORING"

After saving the OpenAI API key, developers can write Python code that connects Gradio UIs to OpenAI models, instantly generating interactive apps.\n\nOne of the most notable features of this integration is its customisation potential. Developers can set their own input and output components, adjust titles, descriptions, and even pre-load example queries. For instance, a developer could set up an interface asking GPT-4-turbo to \u201cExplain quantum gravity to a 5-year-old\u201d or inquire about the number of \u201cR\u201ds in the word \u201cstrawberry,\u201d showcasing the tool\u2019s versatility in real-world applications.\n\nFurthermore, the openai-gradio package allows users to build more complex applications. With Gradio\u2019s \u201cBlocks\u201d feature, developers can combine multiple models within a single web-based interface, providing options like switching between GPT-4-turbo and GPT-3.5-turbo in different tabs, giving flexibility and enhanced functionality to end users.\n\nThe openai-gradio integration supports all chat models provided by OpenAI, making it a comprehensive tool for those seeking to build AI-powered applications. A known issue includes occasional authentication errors, which can be resolved by manually setting the API key in the Python session.\n\nWith this new package, Gradio continues their mission of democratising AI technology, ensuring that creating machine learning applications is simpler and more accessible than ever. Developers are encouraged to explore the openai-gradio library to leverage the full capabilities of OpenAI\u2019s models through Gradio\u2019s intuitive interface."

        "article_content": "The capabilities of artificial intelligence applications and modern processors, such as GPUs, are beginning to exceed data center architectures. While the intense power and cooling demands of generative AI are well reported, relatively little has been set about the memory bottleneck that currently pegs AI performance. But that is changing due to memory innovation.\n\nAI needs memory. Lots of it. Yet traditional memory architectures can act as a bottleneck for AI performance. Thus, the introduction of Compute Express Link is timely. This new server interconnect opens the door to memory resources being pooled and shared. It can help to bridge the performance gap that sits between low-latency memory and solid-state drives. CXL can also lower the cost of memory, which is one of the most expensive elements of IT, while eliminating yet another barrier standing in the way of AI achieving its full potential.\n\nDiscover more about the subject in this TechRepublic Premium feature by Drew Robb.\n\nFeatured text from the download: GEN AI EXPOSES BOTTLENECK The presence of the latest generation of demanding workloads such as gen AI has brutally exposed a bottleneck in IT. As large language models get bigger, as processors and graphical processing units become more powerful, and as rack densities soar, traditional IT designs struggle to keep up. But it is the memory bottleneck that has become most apparent. If you graph CPU cores against time and then factor in memory bandwidth, the divergence in trend lines is stark. Memory bandwidth expansion paralleled CPU core expansion for a while. But it has stalled for several chip generations while the core count grew ever higher. Result: CPUs are getting starved of memory to the point where you are not able to fully benefit from additional cores. As well as latency, once main memory is full, demanding applications can run into issues such as excessive memory copying, too much I/O being consumed by storage, excessive buffering, and out-of-memory errors. Any of these can crash applications if they go on too long. Another common memory problem is underutilized or stranded memory resources. Some processors may be in dire need of memory, while others have an ample supply. This boils down to system design and limitations. DRAM is traditionally housed in dual in-line memory modules close to the CPU. With this design, other CPUs can only access certain DIMMs and not others.\n\nBoost your AI knowledge with our in-depth 11-page PDF. This is available for download at just $9.

She answered the phone at their home in Washington, D.C. and screamed that he\u2019d won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. The prize is the ultimate recognition of his work as a biochemist at the University of Washington.\n\n\u201cI woke up at two [a.m.] and basically didn't sleep through the whole day, which was all parties and stuff,\u201d he told me the day after the announcement. \u201cI'm looking forward to getting back to normal a little bit today.\u201d\n\nLast week was a major milestone for AI, with two Nobel prizes awarded for AI-related discoveries.\n\nBaker wasn\u2019t alone in winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded it to Demis Hassabis, the cofounder and CEO of Google DeepMind, and John M. Jumper, a director at the same company, too. Google DeepMind was awarded for its research on AlphaFold, a tool which can predict how proteins are structured, while Baker was recognized for his work using AI to design new proteins. Read more about it here.\n\nMeanwhile, the physics prize went to Geoffrey Hinton, a computer scientist whose pioneering work on deep learning in the 1980s and \u201990s underpins all of the most powerful AI models in the world today, and fellow computer scientist John Hopfield, who invented a type of pattern-matching neural network that can store and reconstruct data. Read more about it here.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the prize was announced, Hassabis said he believes that it will herald more AI tools being used for significant scientific discoveries.\n\nBut there is one problem. AI needs masses of high-quality data to be useful for science, and databases containing that sort of data are rare, says Baker.\n\nThe prize is a recognition for the whole community of people working as protein designers. It will help move protein design from the \u201clunatic fringe of stuff that no one ever thought would be useful for anything to being at the center stage,\u201d he says."

        "article_content": "Marie Curie is well known for her chemistry achievements but less so for helping other women succeed in science\n\nMarie Curie, born more than 150 years ago, is still the only female scientist many people can name. The double Nobel Prize winner is most famous for her discovery of radioactivity, as well as the radioactive elements radium and polonium. She is less well known for encouraging a generation of women who worked in her lab and went on to work in research because of the path she paved. Though few women in science have reached Curie\u2019s level of fame and name recognition, they continue to make gains in the field because of her life and example.\n\nIn the new book The Elements of Marie Curie: How the Glow of Radium Lit a Path for Women in Science (Atlantic Monthly Press, 2024), author (and Scientific American poetry editor) Dava Sobel chronicles Curie\u2019s life and work, and sketches biographies of many of the women who worked with her. Sobel found that few people are familiar with the network of researchers she nurtured, as well as many other aspects of the famous chemist\u2019s history. \u201cEverybody knows her name, but hardly anybody knows anything about her,\u201d Sobel says.\n\nScientific American spoke with Sobel about Marie Curie\u2019s contributions to science, history and gender equality.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\n\nHow did you learn about the female scientists Curie worked with?\n\nIn 2020 I was asked to review a book called Women in Their Element, a collection of essays about female chemists. The only two names I recognized to begin with were Marie Curie and her daughter [Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie]. But then as I read, I was really struck by the number of women who had spent some time with her, either studying under her or working in her lab. By the fifth or sixth one, it really started to look like a network. And through the Curie Museum in Paris, I discovered there were really at least 45 women who passed through her laboratory. She was the first woman ever to teach at the Sorbonne. And then that made her a magnet for these other women. Also, she was already world-famous because she had won the Nobel Prize, and that spread her name everywhere. So I thought, well, this is something about Madame Curie that most people don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s how I got started.\n\nHow did Curie end up making the huge discoveries she made?\n\nShe had extraordinary drive to get herself out of Warsaw to Paris, to be able to get an advanced education, to believe in herself that much [in the face of strong resistance toward women in science at the time], and then to be willing and able to do the kind of laboratory work that she did. And then she married the right person. She and her husband Pierre Curie worked together when she started to do her doctoral research on this new discovery of [physicist Henri] Becquerel\u2019s, uranic rays.\n\nThis was the radiation coming from uranium decay.\n\nRight. This was a new thing, and nobody was paying attention to it because everybody was more interested in x-rays at the time [in 1896]. And [Curie] thought she\u2019d go after the less exciting topic; there were 1,000 papers already written about x-rays, and nobody was doing anything with uranic rays. So that was the right time.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to me that she entered this field at this time and then had her first child just a year later, in 1897. I\u2019d assumed, before I read the book, that the children came well after she\u2019d established herself as a scientist.\n\nThis is a very female story. She had two children; she had a miscarriage; she had trouble nursing. Some of the women who came to her lab stopped working when they got married and had children. It\u2019s been more than 100 years, and that\u2019s still true for many women in science. I really wanted to meet those issues directly in the book because I think it\u2019s so important for young women to read about other female scientists and how they managed.\n\nDid Curie actively set out to recruit more women into science?\n\nI don\u2019t think she was specifically looking to hire women, but what was different about her was that she had nothing against hiring them. So that was big, and then again, she was so prominent that she attracted them and inspired them. There are a couple of women in the story who were much younger and grew up hearing about her, which made them think, \u201cOh, I could be a scientist, too.\u201d And the amazing thing to me is how she still has that effect. She\u2019s been dead for almost 100 years, but she is still an inspiration\u2014and not just to women who go into science but women in a variety of fields.\n\nWhat do you think most people get wrong about Marie Curie?\n\nYou\u2019ll often hear that she didn\u2019t really do anything: it was all Pierre, and she was just his assistant. Pierre himself was on record debunking that, but nobody listened.\n\nAnother criticism was, \u201cShe used her hands, but not her head. She was very involved in doing all of this very difficult chemical extraction, which required repetition of many steps, and that was what she was good at.\u201d That is also a very familiar trope about women in science: that women do this grunt work, the boring things, and the men just have aha! moments 24 hours a day.\n\nThat kind of attitude is just one aspect of the type of resistance Curie faced. What was the climate like at the time for women in science?\n\nShe was operating in this environment of huge sexism. She was barred from the [French] Academy of Sciences. Even though she had a lot of support, they did not vote her in, and to be published in their weekly proceedings, to present your work, you had to be a member. So she was constantly having to ask friends to present the work of the people in her laboratory, which was an enormous embarrassment. She was the premier authority on her subject, and she didn\u2019t have the standing in the professional community that she deserved. And then later, her daughter tried several times to get voted into the academy. She was also a Nobel Prize winner, and she couldn\u2019t get in either. So yes, there was a lot of sexism, a lot of barricades, but she broke through most of them.\n\nBeyond promoting individual women in science, how do you think Curie changed science for women after her?\n\nWe\u2019re talking about the early 1900s, so physics altogether was at an inflection point, and she was, for three decades, the only woman in the room at these important Solvay Conference meetings [a groundbreaking series of physics congresses that begin in 1911]. So she knew all of the top physicists: [Ernest] Rutherford, [Albert] Einstein, [Enrico] Fermi, Niels Bohr, everybody. She knew them personally, and I think she normalized some of that for them\u2014that \u201coh, yeah, women do this, too,\u201d which might not have occurred to them. So I think, by her presence, she had an effect on her peers.\n\nYou are Scientific American\u2019s poetry column editor. Is there any connection between Curie and poetry?\n\nWell, being Polish and being in a family that was very nationalistic, very proud of their Polish heritage, she grew up on these three very famous Polish poets [Adam Mickiewicz, Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski and Juliusz S\u0142owacki], and her family also had a tradition of writing verses on this or that occasion, and she wrote a couple of poems. She wrote about her life as a student when she was first in Paris. I don\u2019t think she ever wrote any poems about her work. And there have been a lot of poems written about her. Even Adrienne Rich wrote a poem about Madame Curie."

Although they sound similar and are closely related, they\u2019re not the same thing.\n\nA content strategy identifies big-picture goals and plans for your content itself. Content operations refers to how you\u2019ll get the work done. Going after organic traffic to drive conversions could be part of your content strategy whereas operations includes the team, tools, and resources you\u2019ll need to make that happen.\n\nHow to choose the right content operations template\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of variation from one template to the next.

Boston Globe\n\nWith the center of the low to the north, a swooping northwesterly breeze will be in place, which will make it feel even chillier as you\u2019re out and about today. Some wind speeds could reach as high as 15 miles per hour across the city.\n\nA steady breeze will build throughout the day across New England. Boston Globe\n\nTuesday\u2019s Breakdown\n\nSouthern New England: Feeling chilly with a mix of sun and clouds. Today\u2019s highs will likely range from 50 to 55 degrees with a steady breeze to 10 mph.\n\nWestern Mass.: A cold start with some temperatures close to freezing before sunrise. Morning temps in the 30s and low 40s will crawl to the low 50s in the Pioneer Valley, but stay in the upper 40s in the Berkshires. More clouds than sun with a spot sprinkle possible close to the Mass./New York border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCape and Islands: Feeling breezy with variable clouds today. A slightly warmer start than the rest of the region thanks to a warm ocean, but highs to reach the low to mid-50s across the region.\n\nNorthern New England: Feeling cold in the higher terrains of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Western Maine as temperatures likely stalling in the 40s for highs. Scattered light rain or snow showers with maybe a coating in the highest elevations.
