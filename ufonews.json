Sheriff James Gannon noted that there was no immediate danger to the public but confirmed the presence of drones which have \u201cunnerved\u201d residents. However, there\u2019s no clear video evidence directly from these officials that distinctly shows drones or UFOs not mistaken for planes.\n\nGovernment Officials:\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and other state officials have acknowledged the sightings, calling for more transparency and investigation but have not presented clear, video evidence that confirms exceptional drones or UFOs. The state has been actively monitoring the situation, but the focus has been more on the potential risks and the need for legislative action rather than providing definitive evidence.\n\nFBI and DHS:\n\nBoth agencies have been involved in investigating the sightings. They\u2019ve stated that many reported sightings are likely manned aircraft or misidentified objects. There\u2019s no mention of clear, video evidence from these agencies specifically distinguishing exceptional drones or UFOs from regular aircraft. Their focus has been on ensuring there\u2019s no threat to national security or public safety.\n\nPublic and Social Media:\n\nPosts on X have mentioned numerous sightings, including claims of UFO/UAP events in New Jersey with video footage; however, these are not from official sources and should be treated as anecdotal. The validity of these videos as clear evidence of exceptional drones or UFOs is often questioned due to potential misidentification or hoax.\n\nDamage or Effects Caused by These Objects:\n\nNo Significant Damage or Effects:\n\nThere have been no reports of these drones or UFOs causing physical damage or significant effects. The primary impact has been public concern, speculation, and calls for better drone regulation. Authorities have emphasized there\u2019s no known malicious intent or threat from these sightings.\n\nImpact on Public Safety and National Security:\n\nDiscussions around these sightings have led to debates about national security, with some lawmakers suggesting the need for the ability to shoot down unidentified objects, though this has been met with caution due to legal and safety concern.\n\n\"People made fun of me when I posted this originally\"- OP Ryan Ward.

While the popular app already serves its intended purpose, Meta is exploring new ways to modernize it. According to a recent WhatsApp beta build for Android, Meta AI character creation could soon be coming to the mobile app.\n\nPer a WABetaInfo report, Meta is preparing to bring AI character creation to WhatsApp. Version 2.25.1.26 beta for Android reveals how the feature could work if the company proceeds with its plans. Similar to the existing Meta AI Studio tool on Instagram\u2019s website, WhatsApp will seemingly let users build custom AI chatbots by describing their personality, expertise, unique qualities, etc.\n\nTo inspire users creating Meta AI characters, WhatsApp may display trait suggestions when building a chatbot. Based on the included screenshot, there also appears to be a refresh button that will generate new recommendations if users are unhappy with the presented ones.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the AI characters themselves aren\u2019t new; eligible WhatsApp users can already access first- and third-party chatbots in the app. The upcoming addition will only popularize creating them by making the building tools easily accessible.\n\nOtherwise, WABetaInfo highlights that WhatsApp for Android may soon drop the Communities tab in favor of a new one dedicated to AI chats. Those who rely on the Communities feature will still be able to access it through the main Chats tab. It remains unclear when and if Meta will roll out these changes, as they\u2019re still in development.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us! Email our staff at Email our staff at news@androidauthority.com .

Or perhaps even the email software?\n\nBut how many of you would conjure up images of a gigantic creature that flaps its wings and unleashes tempests? And how many more of you are privy to rumors of sightings of such a creature coming out of Pennsylvania?\n\nA Kiowa shield cover decorated with a turtle, a Thunderbird, stars and the milky way. Sightings of the Thunderbird have been reported in Pennsylvania as recently as 2021. (Photo by Werner Forman/Universal Images Group/Getty Images)Universal Images Group via Getty\n\nAccording to \u201cEncyclopedia of Beasts and Monsters in Myth, Legend and Folklore (2016),\u201d Thunderbirds are gigantic spirits from Native American lore that take the form of birds. They\u2019re particularly known for controlling the weather.\n\n\u201cBy [the Thunderbird\u2019s] work, the earth was watered and vegetation grew,\u201d reads Encyclopedia Britannica. \u201cLightning was believed to flash from its beak, and the beating of its wings was thought to represent the rolling of thunder.\u201d\n\nTales vary depending on which tribe tells the story, adds \u201cNative American Myths: Stories & Folklore from the Apache to the Zuni (2018)\u201d: Some believe it\u2019s a god. Others describe it as being more human in shape. The Lakota Sioux even had more than one type of Thunderbird.\n\nNow, it could be argued the Thunderbird myth is among those that can be easily explained: North America is full of incredibly large birds that \u2014 back in the day \u2014 could have been mistaken for some godlike creature. California condors \u2014 North America\u2019s largest wild bird \u2014 has a wingspan of 109 inches, or a little over 9 feet, far exceeding the height of your average Joe.\n\nThat would make it unlikely for anyone to believe they saw a Thunderbird in this day and age, right?\n\nWell.\n\nPeople do, in fact, still claim to see Thunderbirds, vast zoological knowledge out there and all. According to a 2018 Juneau Empire report, a woman proclaimed on Facebook how she spotted a \u201cHUGE\u201d bird \u201calmost the size of a small airplane\u201d in Mendenhall Valley, Alaska. Reddit threads detailing accounts from all over the country \u2014 mainly in the West \u2014 eagerly discuss the potential existence of the being.\n\nAnd, of course, there have been plenty of purported sightings in the Keystone State.\n\nKwakiutl dancers in masks and costumes representing (left to right) Wasp, Thunderbird, and Grizzly-bear, arrive in canoes during the winter ceremony. The myth of the Thunderbird differs from tribe to tribe. (Photo by Buyenlarge/Getty Images)Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Wilds website, sightings of the Thunderbird have popped up in places such as Pine Creek Valley and the I-80 Frontier over the last 100 years or so: A man in Cameron County claimed to have seen a flock of them in 1892. An early pioneer of Potter County swore he saw the same.\n\nThere\u2019s even a legend known as the \u201cLost Thunderbird Photo,\u201d which is said to be evidence of the creature, although it was supposedly lost in a house fire. Researcher Ivan Sanderson \u2014 who states he was the one to have left the photo with the owner of the house that burnt down \u2014 has dedicated a whole website to this lost photo, as well as other paranormal encounters from Bigfoot to the Jersey Devil.\n\n\u201cThis was like a mammoth hawk, or a mammoth eagle or a mammoth raptor of some kind,\u201d describes one witness to an alleged sighting in 1970. \u201cIt was not a condor. It had no resemblance to any prehistoric animal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was an aberration. There are creatures that, for whatever reason, they grow bigger than the average bear.\u201d\n\nThunderbirds have continued to be spotted in Pennsylvania in recent years: Head over to cryptid and alien tracking sites like the one run by Pennsylvania-based researcher Stan Gordon and you\u2019ll find accounts of run-ins with Thunderbirds that have occurred way passed the 1970s.\n\nA Thunderbird as drawn by a Dakota near Fort Snelling, Minnesota, around 1883. (Smithsonian Institution via Wikimedia Commons)Smithsonian Institution via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\u201cIn early April of 2021, [a] woman was just pulling into a parking lot for a scheduled appointment at a location in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,\u201d one such account reads. \u201cShe was a few minutes early, so she was talking with a friend on her cellphone.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, something flew over her vehicle that shadowed the entire car. Even though she was in her car she ducked her head, thinking it was a small plane about to crash. She commented to her friend about what had just happened. Seconds later, she saw the biggest bird she had ever seen flying in front of her car.\u201d\n\nNow, the biggest question is, if these birds are so big, why aren\u2019t more people seeing them?\n\nWell, if you adopt the same line of thinking that some other paranormal researchers apply to other cryptids such as Bigfoot\u2014 as highlighted in \u201cThe Sasquatch People and Their Interdimensional Connection (2011)\u201d \u2014 the Thunderbird can be viewed as a creature that moves among dimensions. In other words, one minute it\u2019s in our dimension where we can spot it, and then, boom, it zips into the unseeable unknown.\n\nSo, are all these sightings just really, really big birds, or creatures from beyond our realm of understanding? You decide.\n\nAnd next time you\u2019re caught in a storm, be sure to take a closer look at the sky."

            "article_content": "The 2000s brought groundbreaking innovations to horror cinema that continue influencing filmmakers today. From found-footage techniques that changed how we experience fear to intimate character studies that elevated the genre\u2019s storytelling potential, this era delivered unforgettable scares that resonated with audiences worldwide. Furthermore, independent productions proved horror could tackle complex themes while maintaining commercial appeal, while major studios took chances on unique creative voices that would reshape the genre landscape.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nThrough careful character development, innovative directing techniques, and genuine emotional stakes, the best horror films of the 2000s demonstrate how genre pictures can tackle complex themes while still delivering the scares audiences crave. Here\u2019s our picks for the best horror movies of the 2000s.\n\nDrag Me to Hell (2009)\n\nPlay video\n\nSam Raimi\u2019s return to horror follows Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), a loan officer cursed to be dragged to hell in three days after denying a mortgage extension to an elderly woman. The film perfectly balances genuine scares with gleefully twisted comedy, powered by Raimi\u2019s masterful direction that transforms this tale of karmic revenge into a rollercoaster ride. Through dynamic camera movements, memorable practical effects, and a deep understanding of how to build tension, Drag Me to Hell creates a uniquely engaging horror experience that demonstrates why Raimi remains one of the genre\u2019s most influential voices.\n\nCloverfield (2008)\n\nPlay video\n\nDirector Matt Reeves and producer J.J. Abrams revolutionized the monster movie genre with this found-footage masterpiece that follows a group of friends documenting their desperate attempt to survive a massive creature attack on New York City. By grounding its spectacular destruction through intimate, documentary-style filmmaking, Cloverfield creates an immersive experience that makes its fantastic elements feel terrifyingly real. The film\u2019s focus on ordinary people caught in extraordinary circumstances and masterful special effects that never break the found-footage illusion create a haunting portrait of survival against impossible odds that still\n\nThe Ring (2002)\n\nPlay video\n\nGore Verbinski\u2019s atmospheric horror masterpiece follows journalist Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) as she investigates a mysterious videotape that kills viewers seven days after watching it. The film\u2019s strength lies in its ability to create overwhelming dread through subtle visual cues and psychological manipulation rather than relying on jump scares. Through its exploration of urban legends and technology-based fears, alongside Watts\u2019 compelling performance as a mother fighting to save her son, The Ring crafts a profoundly unsettling story that transforms mundane objects like televisions and telephones into sources of terror. Plus, The Ring is one of the best horror remakes, capable of standing on its own legs while showing respect for the original Japanese flick.\n\nMartyrs (2008)\n\nPlay video\n\nPascal Laugier\u2019s uncompromising film follows Lucie (Myl\u00e8ne Jampano\u00ef), who escapes from brutal captivity as a child only to be haunted by visions of her tormentors years later. When she finally tracks down those responsible, her closest friend Anna (Morjana Alaoui) becomes entangled in a secret society\u2019s disturbing quest for spiritual enlightenment through suffering. Through its unflinching portrayal of trauma and sophisticated exploration of martyrdom, Martyrs transcends typical revenge narratives to deliver a philosophically rich horror experience that challenges viewers to keep their eyes open while maintaining powerful emotional resonance.\n\nThe Others (2001)\n\nPlay video\n\nAlejandro Amen\u00e1bar\u2019s gothic experience stars Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart, a devoutly religious mother struggling to protect her photosensitive children Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) in a fog-shrouded Victorian mansion. When three mysterious servants arrive, led by the enigmatic Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), a series of inexplicable events forces Grace to question everything she believes about life, death, and reality itself. Through its masterful use of atmosphere and psychological manipulation, The Others transforms familiar haunted house tropes into a profound exploration of grief, faith, and maternal devotion. The film\u2019s true genius lies in how it uses its period setting and gothic elements to craft the ultimate ghost story.\n\nShaun of the Dead (2004)\n\nPlay video\n\nEdgar Wright\u2019s brilliant horror-comedy follows Shaun (Simon Pegg), a directionless electronics salesman stuck in a dead-end job and a failing relationship with his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield). When London falls to a zombie outbreak, Shaun must finally step up, joining forces with his slacker best friend Ed (Nick Frost) to rescue his mother (Penelope Wilton) and win back Liz. Wright\u2019s signature rapid-fire visual style and razor-sharp script, co-written with Pegg, elevate this beyond simple parody. Instead, the zombie apocalypse becomes a perfect backdrop for exploring very human themes about growing up, accepting responsibility, and maintaining relationships.\n\nLet the Right One In (2008)\n\nPlay video\n\nTomas Alfredson\u2019s Swedish masterpiece introduces us to Oskar (K\u00e5re Hedebrant), a bullied 12-year-old boy who forms a profound connection with Eli (Lina Leandersson), a mysterious girl who only appears at night in their snow-covered Stockholm suburb. As their relationship deepens, Oskar\u2019s discovery of Eli\u2019s vampire nature transforms this intimate character study into something far more complex. Against a stark winter landscape, Alfredson crafts a tender coming-of-age story that reimagines vampire mythology through the lens of childhood loneliness.\n\nParanormal Activity (2007)\n\nPlay video\n\nDirected by Oren Peli, this found-footage phenomenon centers on Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat), a young couple whose attempt to document strange occurrences in their suburban San Diego home spirals into a nightmare. As Micah\u2019s obsession with capturing evidence intensifies, the supernatural presence grows more aggressive, revealing a sinister decades-old connection to Katie. Armed with nothing but security cameras and practical effects, Peli manipulates negative space and sound design to create overwhelming dread. Yet beneath the supernatural scares lies an equally disturbing portrait of a relationship crumbling under the weight of fear, making its explosive climax all the more devastating.\n\n28 Days Later (2002)\n\nPlay video\n\nDanny Boyle reimagines zombie cinema by opening with Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakening from a coma to discover London abandoned. Alongside fellow survivors Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley), he uncovers the horrifying reality: a \u201crage\u201d virus has transformed most of the population into rabid killing machines. Shot on early digital video cameras that lend a raw documentary feel, Boyle\u2019s apocalyptic vision stands apart in its exploration of human nature. The real horror emerges not from the infected masses but from the survivors themselves, as the distinction between civilization and savagery blurs in the fight for survival. The movie also redefined the zombie mythology by turning the undead into agile killing machines instead of their classic slow interpretation.\n\nThe Descent (2005)\n\nPlay video\n\nNeil Marshall\u2019s horror movie is one of the best 2000s horror movies, and there are no questions about it. The Descent follows Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), who joins five friends for a spelunking expedition one year after losing her husband and daughter. Under the leadership of the ambitious Juno (Natalie Mendoza), what begins as adventure becomes a desperate fight for survival when the group finds itself trapped in an unmapped cave system. Marshall builds unbearable tension long before revealing the ancient predators lurking in the darkness, as the cave\u2019s suffocating environment brings long-buried resentments and betrayals to the surface. This sophisticated approach to horror transforms a monster movie into a multifaceted study of trauma and survival, with an all-female cast facing both physical and psychological terrors that will haunt viewers long after the credits roll."

            "article_content": "Even for an industry that depends on relentless innovation to thrive, life sciences have seen remarkable advancements in recent decades. From the Human Genome Project paving the way for precision medicine, to monoclonal antibodies, mRNA, CRISPR gene editing, and other major breakthroughs \u2013 our industry continuously proves its ability to serve humanity by consistently one-upping itself.\n\nAnd yet, data science is now poised to usher in a level and acceleration of progress that even life sciences have never before seen.\n\nWhy AI Is now hitting its full stride\n\nAlthough data science and AI have been applied in life sciences for decades, their application has often fallen short of expectations, yielding incremental, rather than transformative, gains. But today\u2019s advances in algorithm sophistication, large-scale data integration, and cloud computing have helped them overcome the fragmented data, slower processing, and other limitations that have been stunting their full power. Regulatory agencies, meanwhile, are providing clearer guidance on the use of models, giving organisations the guardrails needed to innovate faster, with confidence.\n\nTogether, these developments, combined with the global urgency to address humanity\u2019s most pressing health challenges, create a perfect storm for data science and AI to take life sciences to new heights.\n\nWhat makes AI so transformative\n\nWith its ability to process massive and complex datasets, identify hidden patterns, and continuously evolve as it learns from new data, AI brings a depth of understanding and speed of decision-making and discovery that takes it to a level far beyond human capabilities. With predictive modelling, AI doesn\u2019t just analyse existing data it anticipates future outcomes. This allows researchers to solve problems at scale with unprecedented precision and efficiency, significantly reducing the time and cost of bringing new therapies to market.\n\nAI is at a critical juncture, and 2025 promises to be a transformative year. Here\u2019s how I believe models will reshape life sciences in the year ahead:\n\nAI graduates from trials to tangible real-world solutions\n\nThe integration of data science in drug discovery is evolving beyond mere trial phases to practical uses \u2013 especially in the creation and testing of molecular compounds in silico. With algorithms getting better at simulating biological interaction, we can significantly accelerate the process of drug discovery. Not only will this improve initial testing efficiency, it will open doors to novel therapies that revolutionise the pharmaceutical industry and, more importantly, profoundly impact world health.\n\nData science will take diagnostic accuracy to new heights\n\nMachine learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable proficiency over the past year in detecting irregularities in medical images, often exceeding the level of accuracy seasoned professionals can provide. In the year 2025, AI-powered imaging tools will greatly enhance diagnostic precision in radiology and pathology, enabling healthcare providers to deliver more precise determinations. Machine learning-assisted medical imaging of tumours, for instance, will dramatically improve their pairing with the right targeted treatments. Such advancements will play a crucial role in allowing patients to live longer and higher quality lives.\n\nLLMs will transform documentation\n\nFrom scientific manuscripts to clinical trial records and regulatory filings, large language models (LLM) will revolutionise documentation. LLMs are already proving effective in managing specialised medical language, compliance checks, and simplifying complex terms, with providers like IBM and Microsoft integrating them into healthcare documentation. Organisations are also increasingly turning to automation for authorship of Clinical Study Reports using data from clinical systems and statistical computing environments to streamline processes and enhance efficiency. This change will speed up the process of finding new cures and lead to better results for patients, while also boosting the pace and accuracy of advancements.\n\nData science will accelerate clinical trial recruiting\n\nOver the next 12 months, AI will streamline the recruitment process for trials by utilising electronic health records and real-time patient data. This will enable more precise and faster identification of suitable candidates for more successful trials. We are already seeing signs of this transformation with AI-powered platforms significantly reducing recruitment timelines by more accurately matching patients to trial criteria. Such improvements will enhance trial effectiveness and accelerate the pace of medical innovation.\n\nAI compliance platforms will see wide adoption\n\n2025 will see the rise of AI-powered compliance platforms that provide for the real-time monitoring of regulatory adherence across clinical trials, drug manufacturing, and elsewhere. As regulatory requirements grow increasingly complex, such AI solutions will be extremely helpful in managing compliance data in real-time, allowing organisations to maintain operational integrity.\n\n2025 will mark a turning point for data science and AI in life sciences, redefining what\u2019s achievable across the industry. From revolutionising drug discovery and diagnostics to streamlining documentation and compliance, models are accelerating the pace of innovation and enabling breakthroughs that were once unimaginable.\n\nWhile the opportunities are immense, challenges remain. Ethical considerations, data privacy concerns, and navigating complex regulatory frameworks will require careful attention to ensure AI\u2019s potential is realised responsibly. But data science will undoubtedly prove itself as a transformative force reshaping the way we develop therapies, conduct trials, and deliver care. As the industry continues to embrace these capabilities, 2025 is destined to be the year where life sciences once again pushes the boundaries of innovation \u2013 enhancing lives and advancing healthcare on a global scale."

            "article_content": "OpenAI on Monday published what it\u2019s calling an \u201ceconomic blueprint\u201d for AI: a living document that lays out policies the company thinks it can build on with the U.S. government and its allies.\n\nThe blueprint, which includes a forward from Chris Lehane, OpenAI\u2019s VP of global affairs, asserts that the U.S. must act to attract billions in funding for the chips, data, energy, and talent necessary to \u201cwin on AI.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, while some countries sideline AI and its economic potential,\u201d Lehane wrote, \u201cthe U.S. government can pave the road for its AI industry to continue the country\u2019s global leadership in innovation while protecting national security.\u201d\n\nOpenAI has repeatedly called on the U.S. government to take more substantive action on AI and infrastructure to support the technology\u2019s development. The federal government has largely left AI regulation to the states, a situation OpenAI describes in the blueprint as untenable.\n\nIn 2024 alone, state lawmakers introduced almost 700 AI-related bills, some of which conflict with others. Texas\u2019 Responsible AI Governance Act, for example, imposes onerous liability requirements on developers of open source AI models.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has also criticized existing federal laws on the books, such as the CHIPS Act, which aimed to revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry by attracting domestic investment from the world\u2019s top chipmakers. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Altman said that the CHIPS Act \u201c[has not] been as effective as any of us hoped,\u201d and that he thinks there\u2019s \u201ca real opportunity\u201d for the Trump administration to \u201cto do something much better as a follow-on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing I really deeply agree with [Trump] on is, it is wild how difficult it has become to build things in the United States,\u201d Altman said in the interview. \u201cPower plants, data centers, any of that kind of stuff. I understand how bureaucratic cruft builds up, but it\u2019s not helpful to the country in general. It\u2019s particularly not helpful when you think about what needs to happen for the U.S. to lead AI. And the U.S. really needs to lead AI.\u201d\n\nTo fuel the data centers necessary to develop and run AI, OpenAI\u2019s blueprint recommends \u201cdramatically\u201d increased federal spending on power and data transmission, and meaningful buildout of \u201cnew energy sources,\u201d like solar, wind farms, and nuclear. OpenAI \u2014 along with its AI rivals \u2014 has previously thrown its support behind nuclear power projects, arguing that they\u2019re needed to meet the electricity demands of next-generation server farms.\n\nTech giants Meta and AWS have run into snags with their nuclear efforts, albeit for reasons that have nothing to do with nuclear power itself.\n\nIn the nearer term, OpenAI\u2019s blueprint proposes that the government \u201cdevelop best practices\u201d for model deployment to protect against misuse, \u201cstreamline\u201d the AI industry\u2019s engagement with national security agencies, and develop export controls that enable the sharing of models with allies while \u201climit[ing]\u201d their export to \u201cadversary nations.\u201d In addition, the blueprint encourages that the government share certain national security-related information, like briefings on threats to the AI industry, with vendors, and help vendors secure resources to evaluate their models for risks.\n\n\u201cThe federal government\u2019s approach to frontier model safety and security should streamline requirements,\u201d the blueprint reads. \u201cResponsibly exporting \u2026 models to our allies and partners will help them stand up their own AI ecosystems, including their own developer communities innovating with AI and distributing its benefits, while also building AI on U.S. technology, not technology funded by the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\nOpenAI already counts a few U.S. government departments as partners, and \u2014 should its blueprint gain currency among policymakers \u2014 stands to add more. The company has deals with the Pentagon for cybersecurity work and other, related projects, and it has teamed up with defense startup Anduril to supply its AI tech to systems the U.S. military uses to counter drone attacks.\n\nIn its blueprint, OpenAI calls for the drafting of standards \u201crecognized and respected\u201d by other nations and international bodies on behalf of the U.S. private sector. But the company stops short of endorsing mandatory rules or edicts. \u201c[The government can create] a defined, voluntary pathway for companies that develop [AI] to work with government to define model evaluations, test models, and exchange information to support the companies safeguards,\u201d the blueprint reads.\n\nThe Biden administration took a similar tack with its AI executive order, which sought to enact several high-level, voluntary AI safety and security standards. The executive order established the U.S. AI Safety Institute (AISI), a federal government body that studies risks in AI systems, which has partnered with companies including OpenAI to evaluate model safety. But Trump and his allies have pledged to repeal Biden\u2019s executive order, putting its codification \u2014 and the AISI \u2014 at risk of being undone.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s blueprint also addresses copyright as it relates to AI, a hot-button topic. The company makes the case that AI developers should be able to use \u201cpublicly available information,\u201d including copyrighted content, to develop models.\n\nOpenAI, along with many other AI companies, trains models on public data from across the web. The company has licensing agreements in place with a number of platforms and publishers, and offers limited ways for creators to \u201copt out\u201d of its model development. But OpenAI has also said that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to train AI models without using copyrighted materials, and a number of creators have sued the company for allegedly training on their works without permission.\n\n\u201c[O]ther actors, including developers in other countries, make no effort to respect or engage with the owners of IP rights,\u201d the blueprint reads. \u201cIf the U.S. and like-minded nations don\u2019t address this imbalance through sensible measures that help advance AI for the long-term, the same content will still be used for AI training elsewhere, but for the benefit of other economies. [The government should ensure] that AI has the ability to learn from universal, publicly available information, just like humans do, while also protecting creators from unauthorized digital replicas.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen which parts of OpenAI\u2019s blueprint, if any, influence legislation. But the proposals are a signal that OpenAI intends to remain a key player in the race for a unifying U.S. AI policy.\n\nIn the first half of last year, OpenAI more than tripled its lobbying expenditures, spending $800,000 versus $260,000 in all of 2023. The company has also brought former government leaders into its executive ranks, including ex-Defense Department official Sasha Baker, NSA chief Paul Nakasone, and Aaron Chatterji, formerly the chief economist at the Commerce Department under President Joe Biden.\n\nAs it makes hires and expands its global affairs division, OpenAI has been more vocal about which AI laws and rules it prefers, for instance throwing its weight behind Senate bills that would establish a federal rule-making body for AI and provide federal scholarships for AI R&D. The company has also opposed bills, in particular California\u2019s SB 1047, arguing that it would stifle AI innovation and push out talent.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

            "article_content": "OpenAI wants you to think of AI like a car. Europe invented the car, but heavy regulations prevented its widespread adoption there. In laissez-faire America, the car dominated the culture. OpenAI wants the U.S. to do that again. On Monday the company behind ChatGPT published AI in America: OpenAI\u2019s Economic Blueprint, a whitepaper that calls on Washington to let AI determine the country\u2019s future.\n\nAI in America is a slight 15-page document with an AI-generated photo on its cover that shows an architect\u2019s desk overlooking a futuristic cityscape. The picture and 15 pages seem fine at first glance. But like so much of the stuff attached to AI, both the image and the outline for economic prosperity seem vague and grotesque the more you inspect them. The picture\u2019s coffee cup has no handle. The words written on the pages of the picture look like unreadable smudges. The economic blueprint contains calls to action that ask the government to turn over public secrets to large private companies.\n\nThe more you look, the more things fall apart. OpenAI\u2019s Economic Blueprint is a call for a lightly regulated AI future where government-collected data, both state secrets and public information, is fed into its vast and hungry machines.\n\nThe first thing OpenAI wants you to know is that AI is very important and very scary. \u201cAI is too powerful to be led and shaped by autocrats, but that is the growing risk we face, while the economic opportunity AI presents is too compelling to forfeit,\u201d reads an opening note from OpenAI vice president of global affairs Chris Lehane. \u201cShared prosperity is as near and measurable as the new jobs and growth\u2060(opens in a new window) that will come from building more AI infrastructure like data centers, chip manufacturing facilities, and power plants.\u201d\n\nAnd how should America accomplish such ambitious goals? By sharing as many of its secrets as possible with AI companies. \u201cAs appropriate, share national security-related information and resources that it alone maintains\u2014such as briefings on security threats to the industry and high-level results of testing US and non-US AI models\u2014with US AI companies pursuing advanced research,\u201d the economic blueprints says.\n\nIt goes further. OpenAI always wants the feds to share their \u201cunique expertise with AI companies, including information about how to secure their IP against industrial security threats and mitigate potential cyber, chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear CBRN and other risks that are heightened by increasingly powerful models.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, there\u2019s all that wonderful data just sitting around waiting to be scanned. \u201cA lot of government data is in the public domain. Making it more accessible or machine-readable could help US AI developers of all sizes, especially those working in fields where vital data is disproportionately government-held,\u201d the blueprint says. \u201cIn exchange, developers using this data could work with government to unlock new insights that help it develop better public policies.\u201d\n\nThe economic blueprint also notes that \u201cinfrastructure is destiny\u201d and that the U.S. is in a unique position to create jobs and get ahead of China. All it has to do is focus on building infrastructure for AI systems, if not people. \u201cIn the AI era, chips, data, energy and talent are the resources that will underpin continued US leadership, and as with the mass production of the automobile, marshalling these resources will create widespread economic opportunity and reinforce our global competitiveness,\u201d it says.\n\nWhat does that mean? \u201cSeizing the moment and building the infrastructure needed to produce enough energy and chips to drive down the cost of compute and make it abundant,\u201d it says. \u201cIn turn, this will create tens of thousands of skilled-trade jobs, boost local economies through spending and indirect job creation, and modernize our energy grid in the near term\u2014 ultimately supporting the kind of breakthroughs and innovations that drive lasting economic growth.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019ll work, provided AI ends up being as important to the long-term future of the world as OpenAI and all the other AI companies would have you believe.\n\nOpenAI published its economic blueprint for America the morning the Biden White House announced sweeping new regulations of the industry. Biden\u2019s new regulations will create a tiered list of countries that AI companies do business with. On tier one is the U.S. and 18 of its allies. Those countries are free of restrictions. China and Russia are on tier three and no AI companies can do business with them. The rest of the world is in tier 2. They can have a little AI, as a treat. But the White House will set caps.\n\n\u201cIn its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America\u2019s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review,\u201d NVIDIA said in a blog post about the new regulations. \u201cThis sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America\u2019s leading semiconductors, computers, systems and even software are designed and marketed globally.\u201d\n\nThese seem to be the kinds of burdensome regulations that OpenAI railed against in its economic blueprint. But it\u2019s also mostly focused on countries other than the U.S. Altman and OpenAI have long attempted to thread the needle of calling AI a revolutionary technology that needed to be unleashed while also claiming it\u2019s dangerous and in need of serious regulation.\n\nBut the regulation-friendly Democrats are no longer in power. Everything could change in a week. Elon Musk is no fan of Altman and OpenAI and, for now, he\u2019s close to the incoming president. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how OpenAI\u2019s calls for loose government regulation and widespread access to federal data are met by the new President and his Musk-backed administration."

These job postings include an EE Sensing Engineer, Robotics Mechanical Design Engineer, and TPM Manager.\n\nClicking links to the roles yields a description of a Robotics team that is \"focused on unlocking general-purpose robotics and pushing towards AGI-level intelligence in dynamic, real-world setting.\" The description also describes the team's aim to bring robotic systems from prototype to full-scale production.\n\nMany users are expressing unease about OpenAI delving into the robotics space. However, when one user commented, \"The thought of OpenAI with hardware\ud83d\ude2c\", Kalinowski attempted to diffuse concerns, citing the benefits instead.\n\n\"Yeah, I cannot wait!\" replied Kalinowski. \"Imagine being able to send a robot to do a job that's really dangerous for a human.\"\n\nUntil now, OpenAI has developed its AI models to streamline workflows, with the next logical step being integration into physical devices to enhance user assistance. However, following examples like Elon Musk's Tesla, which announced the Optimus humanoid robot in 2021 but has yet to release it, a market-ready robot may still be years away.\n\nRobotics can also mean things outside of humanoid robots, including less flashy robots -- such as robot vacuums -- that help accomplish everyday functions. Moreover, when asked in the comments if the focus would be humanoid robots, Kalinowski said that is yet to be determined, with the initial team defining and building the roadmap."

Discovery editorial team, will explain in simple terms how radiation can safely be used to solve some of the world\u2019s most pressing global challenges. These include:\n\nMicroplastics in the ocean (filmed in Monaco/Global)\n\nThe growing cancer burden (filmed in India)\n\nFood insecurity (filmed in Austria/Global)\n\nWater scarcity in the face of climate change (filmed in Austria/Costa Rica)\n\nIndustrial contamination (filmed in Czech Republic)\n\nEach of these films is around one minute long and will play as part of Discovery\u2019s \u2018Good To Know\u2019, a new educational videos series about the benefits of nuclear science and technology, both on television and online.\n\nFuture films to be included in the series will continue to investigate how nuclear science can help development, particularly in the light of climate change, such as by measuring how coastal regions sequester carbon, or how the oceans are becoming more acidic, or how pest insects can be controlled without chemicals. The films will also highlight more details on key IAEA programmes to battle plastic pollution, drought and hunger.\n\nThe films are made in conjunction with the IAEA's twelve nuclear sciences and applications laboratories, a unique feature in the United Nations. The laboratories develop and share nuclear techniques with countries around the world. Watch a three-minute film about the labs here.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said: \u201cPeople may know us as the nuclear watchdog, helping enhance safety, security and safeguards in places like Fukushima, Iran, Ukraine. But not enough people know of the amazing potential nuclear science has to make tangible differences in people\u2019s lives \u2013 helping farmers grow better crops, cancer patients get better treatment, governments understand and protect key natural areas. As the terrible effects of climate change become more obvious to people around the world, it is important for the public to also know there is hope. Science, as always, offers solutions to many of our main challenges.\u201d\n\nNajat Mokhtar, Head of IAEA Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications, agreed: \u201cI am delighted to see ours labs' the vital research being shared on the respected Discovery Channel. Science is a vital force for good in the world, and nuclear science offers so many incredible innovations to help countries meet their development goals.\u201d\n\nJamie Cooke, Executive Vice President and Managing Director Central Europe, Middle East and Turkey said: \u201cWe are thrilled that our viewers will now get the opportunity to learn more about how nuclear science is being used in innovative ways to improve our lives and advance the environmental sustainability agenda. We consider it our duty to leverage the voice, storytelling strength and expertise we have, to cast light and tell the right stories that will positively impact our communities and viewers. It\u2019s part of our Social Good Strategy, and we want to use our media for good.\u201d\n\nAbout the International Atomic Energy Agency\n\nWidely known as the world\u2019s \u201cAtoms for Peace and Development\u201d organization within the United Nations family, the IAEA is the international centre for cooperation in the nuclear field.

They lost the first meeting of the season to the 10-win Rams, 30-20 in Week 8.\n\nBoth teams should be able to put an ample amount of points on the board, so the top recommended bet is to take the Over at 47.5 (-118). Minnesota finished the regular season with the 28th-ranked pass defense in the NFL, and Los Angeles ranked 20th.\n\nExpect Kyren Williams to tote a heavy load on offense as the Rams look to control the clock as much as possible while trying to stave off the Minnesota blitz. The Minnesota pass defense will have its hands full trying to contain Puka Nacua. When the Vikings have the ball, though, they have the ability to strike quickly with Sam Darnold\u2019s top targets, Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison.\n\nBut Darnold does show a tendency to make an untimely error, and an interception could cost Minnesota the game. Also consider the Rams to cover the spread."

            "article_content": "Driving slowly gives greater control\n\nAs Shubham reminds us with his car analogy, \u201cThe lower the gear in a car, the more control you have over the engine, but you go with less speed.\u201d As applied to coding, \u201cIf you feel in control, go to a higher gear. If you are overwhelmed or stuck, go to a lower gear.\u201d That\u2019s the secret. It\u2019s always personal to the developer in question and requires a level of self-awareness, but that\u2019s the key. As Shubham says, \u201cAI-assisted coding is all about grokking when you need to gain more granular control and when you need to let go of control to move faster,\u201d recognizing that \u201chigher-level gears leave more room for errors and trust issues.\u201d\n\nMore senior engineers seem to understand this, entrusting AI tools cautiously (i.e., using them to get more done while in \u201clower gears\u201d like auto-complete). The problem is that junior engineers and non-engineers trust AI tools way more than they should. To some extent, we can blame years of marketing by low-code and no-code platforms that promise to turn everyone into a developer without any (or much) software knowledge. This has always been a false hope.\n\nHere\u2019s the solution: If you want to use AI coding assistants, don\u2019t use them as an excuse not to learn to code. The robots aren\u2019t going to do it for you. The engineers who will get the most out of AI assistants are those who know software best. They\u2019ll know when to give control to the coding assistant and how to constrain that assistance (perhaps to narrow the scope of the problem they allow it to work on). Less-experienced engineers run the risk of moving fast but then getting stuck or not recognizing the bugs that the AI has created."

Now it often provides higher quality, stronger security, better privacy, unparalleled extensibility, and access to innovation compared to proprietary rivals. It is no coincidence that 96% of all software today relies on open source, and large enterprises are increasingly inclined to invest in OSS-based solutions to capitalize on these advantages.\n\nFor venture investors like myself, this shift in market preferences represents a significant opportunity to fund the next generation of OSS-based category leaders in enterprise software. And a few notable trends will likely shape how this market area will likely evolve in 2025 and beyond.\n\nRise of open source AI\n\nThe rapid development of foundational large language models, related AI infrastructure, and their applications has ignited debates around the crucial AI challenges. Many of these issues \u2014 such as transparency, adaptability, and security \u2014 can be addressed through openness. After the initial wave led by closed-source pioneers like OpenAI and Anthropic, a new cohort of open source AI models, including Meta\u2019s Llama and Mistral AI, is now raising the tide and boosting the global AI ecosystem."

This move comes as the company adapts to significant shifts in the US political landscape since the launch of ChatGPT.\n\nLater this month, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, along with other top personnel, will convene a meeting with policymakers in Washington. The purpose of this gathering is to discuss a new \"economic blueprint\" for AI, according to the company. The policy proposals, which were made public on Monday, urge the public and private sectors to collaborate in areas such as energy and infrastructure. This is part of a strategy to maintain the US's lead over China in AI, a pitch that is likely to resonate with the incoming Trump administration.\n\nOpenAI, based in San Francisco, also intends to host events in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Alabama in the upcoming months. The company will announce new AI projects in each of these states, as stated by OpenAI's Vice President of Global Affairs, Chris Lehane, in an interview with Bloomberg News. These announcements are being framed as part of a fresh \"Innovating for America\" initiative that aims to stimulate economic activity around AI across the country.\n\nOver the last year, OpenAI and Altman have been urging the Biden administration to facilitate the construction of more data centers and the development of energy resources required for AI. Currently, OpenAI and other AI firms are adapting to the uncertainty surrounding the incoming Trump administration's AI strategy.\n\nThe President-elect, Donald Trump, is anticipated to revoke crucial elements of the Biden administration's AI agenda, including a 2023 executive order on artificial intelligence. Elon Musk, a supporter of Trump, has recently gained more influence in Washington. This has raised concerns that Musk might advocate for policies that benefit his own companies, including startup xAI, which is a competitor to OpenAI.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Bias and Discrimination: Black-box models often reflect the biases present in the data from which they learn. Because these models lack adequate transparency, biases can emerge, leading to over- or underrepresentation of certain groups in the population, ultimately favoring one group over another.\n\n2. Lack of Accountability: In high-stakes sectors such as criminal justice and healthcare, AI systems make critical decisions without being able to explain their reasoning. This lack of accountability can be problematic when a wrong decision results in negative consequences, as it becomes difficult to attribute responsibility.\n\n3. Trust Breakdown: As AI technology becomes more widespread, establishing trust is essential for its acceptance. If users do not understand or trust the decisions made by AI, it could lead to resistance against the technology, limiting its potential benefits.\n\n4. Regulatory Compliance: When governments implement regulations concerning AI transparency, organizations that utilize black-box models may face challenges in meeting legal standards, putting them at risk of fines or restrictions."

            "article_content": "\u201cEconomic policies have profound effects on the tensions within and between countries \u2014 tensions that can lead to war,\u201d renowned progressive economist James K. Boyce remarked to me recently, adding that economics is in part \u201cabout plunder \u2026 and plunder sometimes morphs into war.\u201d\n\nGiven that economic triggers clearly contribute to conflicts, why is war a topic largely neglected by the economics profession?\n\nIn the interview that follows, Boyce explains why war is ignored by most economists; dissects the link between economics and war, and more specifically capitalism\u2019s relationship to war and conflict; and discusses the role that economics can play in peacebuilding.\n\nJames K. Boyce is professor emeritus of economics and senior fellow of the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He is the author of Investing in Peace: Aid and Conditionality after Civil Wars and editor of Peace and the Public Purse: Economic Policies for Postwar Statebuilding and Economic Policy for Building Peace: The Lessons of El Salvador. He received the 2024 Global Inequality Research Award and the 2017 Leontief Prize for Advancing the Frontiers of Economic Thought. This interview is based on his seven-part video series released by the Institute for New Economic Thinking in October 2024.\n\nC. J. Polychroniou: War and peace are topics studied by scholars in the fields of political science and international affairs and largely ignored by economists. But in a series of lectures available from the Institute for New Economic Thinking, you argue that economic theory has a lot to offer. So, start by telling us how economics can help us analyze war and peace yet why mainstream economists think that war and peace are not an \u201ceconomic\u201d problem.\n\nJames K. Boyce: Let me start with the second part of your question: why, despite the long history of wars and their terrible consequences for human well-being and economies, this topic is neglected today by most economists.\n\nOne basic reason is that rather than starting from observed reality and then trying to make sense of it, orthodox economics starts from theory and then tries to squeeze reality into it. Whatever doesn\u2019t fit is dismissed as \u201cnon-economic.\u201d This is what I call the \u201cshrug\u201d response: War is somebody else\u2019s problem.\n\nThe other response is to concede that economics may be relevant to the dynamics of war and peace, but then to claim the way to minimize violent conflict is to stick to business-as-usual policy prescriptions focused on efficiency and growth. This is what I call the \u201csmug\u201d response: Economics matters, but there is no need for rethinking.\n\nThe videos discuss why, in my view, these responses are inadequate and irresponsible. In truth, economic policies have profound effects on the tensions within and between countries \u2014 tensions that can lead to war. They also can affect the success of efforts to build a durable peace. Of course, economics is not the whole story. But neither is it wholly immaterial.\n\nAs to how economics can help us to analyze war and peace, one key point is that we must pay attention to not only the size of the economic pie but also how it is sliced. This includes not only vertical inequality, the distribution of wealth and income between rich and poor, as measured for example by the Gini coefficient, but also horizontal inequality, the distribution of wealth and income across lines of ethnicity, region, race and religion that often form the fault lines of conflict.\n\nCarl von Clausewitz\u2019s most famous saying is that war is the continuation of politics by other means. According to his thinking, war occurs as states pursue goals that clash with the goals of other states. What else can economics tell us about why wars occur?\n\nOne could also say that politics is the continuation of economics by other means. This is evident once we realize that economics involves more than the textbook fantasy world of perfectly competitive markets with perfectly defined property rights. Economics is also about plunder, the seizure of resources and the control of market choke points. And plunder sometimes morphs into war.\n\nIn neoclassical economic theory, plunder is ruled out by assumption: The theory begins an initial distribution of \u201cendowments,\u201d in effect, property rights that fall from the sky. This distribution, together with preferences and technology (likewise typically taken to be exogenous) determines what will be produced and who will consume it. In the real world, however, people devote a lot of time and effort to battles over the control of property, as any lawyer will tell you.\n\nIn Marxian economic theory, plunder is seen as having played a crucial role during the \u201crosy dawn of primitive accumulation\u201d before the industrial era, when fortunes were acquired by theft, enslavement and expropriation. But during the 19th century the engine of wealth accumulation shifted to the appropriation of the surplus value produced by wage labor, and the main axis of conflict became the struggle over the division of output between capital and labor. Yet in practice, conflicts over land, minerals, and other forms of property remain a common feature of economic life even in the advanced industrialized economies, and these conflicts are ubiquitous in many former colonies like the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nIn addition to struggles over control of resources, we also see constant struggles over control of markets. Monopolies and oligopolies yield profits well above what would prevail in a textbook world of perfect competition. Choke points are especially lucrative in markets for essential commodities like oil and minerals and in key technologies like software and semiconductors.\n\nBoth sorts of plunder \u2014 via appropriation of resources and control of markets \u2014 are ruled out as long as economic theory is based only on free exchanges among consenting adults. Instead, they involve the coercive power of the state, the manipulation and subversion of legal frameworks, and chicanery as well as outright theft. In the words of Woody Guthrie, the great American folksinger, \u201cSome rob you with a six-gun, and some with a fountain pen.\u201d\n\nGreed is often seen as a cause of war in modern times. But is it because people are greedy or because they are capitalist that conflict and wars occur? Aren\u2019t capitalism and war linked?\n\nWell, yes. Economies and wars are linked, and most people live today in capitalist economies. But wars happened long before capitalism, and it would be na\u00efve to assume that without it wars would disappear. Capitalism is distinctive, however, in that its ideological cheerleaders sometimes extoll greed as a positive virtue. It is hard to imagine the phrase \u201cgreed is good\u201d gaining moral traction in other societies. But even under capitalism, calling a person greedy typically is not meant as a compliment.\n\nOne of the videos in the series describes a research project on the economics of violent conflict that was launched in the late 1990s by the World Bank. The project aimed to assess the respective roles of greed and grievance as drivers of civil war. Opportunities for the plunder of natural resources were found to be a strong predictor of conflict, and this was seen as evidence that greed is a key cause of war.\n\nGrievance, for which vertical income inequality was taken as a proxy variable, was initially found to be relatively unimportant. But this was partly due to how inequality was conceptualized. For understanding the roots of war, we must look at not only vertical inequality \u2014 overall gaps between rich and poor \u2014 but also horizontal inequality.\n\nGreed and grievance can feed each other. The greedy behavior of kleptocrats, oligarchs and their cronies leads to grievances among the public, and these provide fertile ground for the rise of rebel leaders who then pursue their own opportunistic, greed-driven agendas. Both greed and grievance are important in the dismal science of war.\n\nWhat role can economics play in peacebuilding, and what do you see as the main obstacles to investing in peace?\n\nIn war-torn societies, economic recovery is crucial in building a durable peace. The prospect of a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d \u2014 economic benefits after the cessation of hostilities \u2014 often serves as an important incentive for warring parties to come to a negotiated settlement that falls short of their ultimate political objectives.\n\nThat said, it is not enough simply to rebuild infrastructure and reboot growth. How the economic fruits of recovery are distributed within and between the opposing sides also matters greatly. For external assistance to contribute effectively to peacebuilding, other choices matter greatly, too: whether the aid helps to build a legitimate and effective state or instead has the effect of undermining statebuilding; whether goods and services needed for projects are procured locally or imported from overseas; and what formal and informal conditions are attached to the provision of aid. I discuss these in the videos.\n\nIn the last episode, I identify four important obstacles to investing in peace. One is that the commercial and geopolitical aims of aid donors do not necessarily align with the needs of peacebuilding. Second, the internal incentive structures of aid agencies, where the emphasis is on \u201capproval and disbursement,\u201d impedes the careful calibration of aid disbursements as a carrot to advance the peace process. A third obstacle lies in the ideological biases of policymakers, especially economists, who focus on \u201cefficiency\u201d \u2014 defined simplistically as a larger economic pie \u2014 to the exclusion of other considerations, including how the pie is sliced. The final obstacle is that aid recipients sometimes object to peace conditionality, claiming that it infringes on \u201cnational sovereignty,\u201d as if aid otherwise would not have political impacts. These obstacles are not insuperable, but the first step in dealing with them is to face them squarely.\n\nHelp us Prepare for Trump\u2019s Day One Trump is busy getting ready for Day One of his presidency \u2013 but so is Truthout. Trump has made it no secret that he is planning a demolition-style attack on both specific communities and democracy as a whole, beginning on his first day in office. With over 25 executive orders and directives queued up for January 20, he\u2019s promised to \u201claunch the largest deportation program in American history,\u201d roll back anti-discrimination protections for transgender students, and implement a \u201cdrill, drill, drill\u201d approach to ramp up oil and gas extraction. Organizations like Truthout are also being threatened by legislation like HR 9495, the \u201cnonprofit killer bill\u201d that would allow the Treasury Secretary to declare any nonprofit a \u201cterrorist-supporting organization\u201d and strip its tax-exempt status without due process. Progressive media like Truthout that has courageously focused on reporting on Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza are in the bill\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nAs journalists, we have a responsibility to look at hard realities and communicate them to you. We hope that you, like us, can use this information to prepare for what\u2019s to come. And if you feel uncertain about what to do in the face of a second Trump administration, we invite you to be an indispensable part of Truthout\u2019s preparations. In addition to covering the widespread onslaught of draconian policy, we\u2019re shoring up our resources for what might come next for progressive media: bad-faith lawsuits from far-right ghouls, legislation that seeks to strip us of our ability to receive tax-deductible donations, and further throttling of our reach on social media platforms owned by Trump\u2019s sycophants. We\u2019re preparing right now for Trump\u2019s Day One: building a brave coalition of movement media; reaching out to the activists, academics, and thinkers we trust to shine a light on the inner workings of authoritarianism; and planning to use journalism as a tool to equip movements to protect the people, lands, and principles most vulnerable to Trump\u2019s destruction. We\u2019re asking all of our readers to start a monthly donation or make a one-time donation \u2013 as a commitment to stand with us on day one of Trump\u2019s presidency, and every day after that, as we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation. You\u2019re an essential part of our future \u2013 please join the movement by making a tax-deductible donation today. If you have the means to make a substantial gift, please dig deep during this critical time!

            "article_content": "The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard is partnering with Manifold to bring a unique life science research and development platform to investigators around the world.\n\nHealthcare data have become increasingly available in larger quantities and are stored across a multitude of cloud service providers. The Broad Institute will begin to use Manifold\u2019s AI platform to address this problem through Manifold\u2019s cloud agnostic architecture. Together, Manifold and Broad will adapt the existing platform to advance genomic research inside and outside of the institute.\n\nThe Broad Institute is a pioneering research lab that began when Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers came together in 2004 with the goal of advancing genomic research through collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe recognized that there were certain types of research projects that were going to be really important to catalyze advances in biomedical research across the entire ecosystem, and yet it would be difficult to accomplish them in a typical academic lab,\u201d Todd Golub, director of the Broad Institute, said in an interview.\n\nManifold was founded by Vinay Seth Mohta, now CEO, in 2016 as a consulting company for using AI in healthcare research. In 2021, Manifold began building its R&D platform to bring no-code software to research institutions.\n\n\u201cWe started in cancer research with a focus there, because we saw that cancer consistently pushed science and technology the hardest, and also, as a result, pushed data the hardest, and where we were seeing a lot of pain,\u201d Mohta said.\n\nManifold has deployed its research and development platform with the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\n\u201cWith the Broad Institute, we're really excited about some of the novel genomics-related capabilities that will bring, based on learning about their use cases, which, by the way, are going to be the use cases everybody's going to have in about three years,\u201d Mohta said. \u201cBecause that's what the Broad does. They're leading the world in science.\u201d\n\nThe lessons from the Broad over its two-decade history will be incorporated into the Manifold platform. One of the key turning points from the Broad's existing software is that researchers will be able to use it without having to know how to code. The organization specifically has plans to do so with its bioinformatics pipeline.\n\nMohta said they plan to add new capabilities every quarter to allow more researchers to come onto the platform, along with collaborations the Broad Institute itself has with other institutions, like companies or other research institutions.\n\n\u201cWith a more modern technical architecture, it really opens up the ability to enable AI more natively, which will again, fuel the future of discovery when we think about what we can do with the data,\u201d Heather Jankins, co-lead of the Data Sciences Platform at the Broad Institute, said.\n\nPerhaps the most exciting feature of the new platform, Golub said, is its \u201cbring your own cloud\u201d capability.\n\nAccording to Manifold, \"bring your own cloud\" means that users of the platform can seamlessly use their existing cloud service provider to power the Manifold research platform.\n\n\u201cScience happens on all clouds, and so we want to make sure that we're enabling science to the maximum,\u201d Jankins said. \u201cFrom that perspective, having a platform that has natively made some cloud agnostic choices is very exciting for us to make sure that we can really leverage using the data, where the data lives.\u201d\n\nResearch institutions use all manner of different cloud providers such as Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. Without the \"bring your own cloud\" capability, researchers may have to consider migrating their data to another cloud to be compatible with a certain research platform or opt out of using it.\n\n\u201cYou have this convergence of two things happening right now, which is an explosion of the amount of data that's possible to generate, and the power of AI making it possible for everybody to ask complex questions of large data sets, regardless of where they're generated,\u201d Golub said. \u201cThat's a very different world than the way research used to work, which is that you do experiments in your own lab and you analyze those results.\u201d\n\nGolub continued: \u201cThis is still very early days of data generation, data aggregation, data and complex data analysis. And so we need to think about the future of this activity and what's going to be needed for the next phase, given that continued explosion of data and need, and that was a motivation for the Broad-Manifold collaboration.\u201d\n\nAlso important to the Broad Institute was Manifold\u2019s ability to create a trusted research environment where access to patient\u2019s genomic data is only allowed by authorized users for a finite period of time.\n\nOne of Manifold\u2019s current customers is the ACS, which has several ongoing cancer studies with 1.5 million participants. With Manifold, the ACS is allowing outside research institutions to use its data while ensuring the data is safely accessed.\n\n\u201cThe point of this exercise is to accelerate the pace at which the world can make important discoveries that will help patients, and without a really scalable, durable, powerful data platform, that's not going to go as quickly as possible, and so we're excited to make that possible,\u201d Golub said."

Initially claiming to help the scavengers trapped aboard the Romulus, he eventually becomes an impediment to their escape.\n\nFor the recreation, which was made with the consent of Holm\u2019s estate, a combination of CGI and puppetry was used to achieve the likeness of the actor, who passed away in 2020.\n\nSpeaking to Empire recently, Alvarez agreed with criticisms of the scene, saying: \u201cI wasn\u2019t 100 per cent happy with some of the shots, where you could feel a bit more the CG intervention. So, for people that react negatively, I don\u2019t blame them\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlvarez continued: \u201cWe fixed it. We made it better for the release right now. I convinced the studio we need to spend the money and make sure we give the companies that were involved in making it the proper time to finish it and do it right. It\u2019s so much better\u201d. This was done, explains, by lessening the influence of CGI on the character \u201cWhat we did (for the streaming version) was revert a lot more to the puppet\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s way better.\u201d\n\nFascinating\u2026 streaming versions of Alien: Romulus have apparently made some tweaks to certain shots of Rook VFX (via Reddit) pic.twitter.com/XMEY6iT7QG \u2014 Alien Theory (@Alien_Theory) January 10, 2025\n\nAlien: Romulus was a box office hit and critically well-received.
