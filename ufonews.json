        "article_content": "Watch live! Pentagon UFO office testifies to Senate emerging threats committee - YouTube Watch On\n\nA U.S. Senate subcommittee will hear from the Pentagon's UFO office tomorrow, and you can watch live.\n\nDirector Jon T. Kosloski of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, will testify before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities on Tuesday (Nov. 19) starting at 4:30 p.m. ET (2130 GMT). A closed-door session off-limits to the public will be held prior to the open session, beginning at 3:15 p.m. ET (2015 GMT).\n\nYou can watch the hearing live at Space.com, courtesy of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nAARO's logo in front of the Pentagon. AARO's Latin motto translates roughly as \"the universe is changing/our life is what our thoughts make of it.\" (Image credit: AARO/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Department of Defense created AARO in July 2022 in order to serve as a \"focal point for all UAP and UAP-related activities and may represent the Department for such activities,\" the Pentagon said at the time, in a statement.\n\nAARO has already released its 2024 report, which covers sightings of UFOs (or UAP, as they're now known) between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024 as well as \"all UAP reports from any previous time periods that were not included in an earlier report.\"\n\nThe document states that AARO received 757 total case reports during the period, 485 of which fell within the reporting timeframe. Of these cases, 118 were solved and another 174 are slated for closure pending a final review.\n\nStill, many cases remain unsolved, and AARO continues to study them. However, the report notes that \"AARO has discovered no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technology.\"\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe office's previous report, released in January 2023, came to similar conclusions.\n\nAARO also concluded in the report that it has \"no indication or confirmation\" that UFO reports are \"attributable to foreign adversaries.\"\n\nAARO's latest findings might not sit well with some in the UFO/UAP community.\n\nThat's because, just last week, a quartet of high-profile witnesses \u2014 including a retired U.S. Navy rear admiral, a former NASA associate administrator and a former U.S. counterintelligence officer \u2014 told the U.S. House of Representatives that a wide-ranging and long-running government conspiracy has, for decades, served to \"hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos\" from the American public.\n\nWe are \"in the midst of a multi-decade, secretive arms race \u2014 one funded by misallocated taxpayer dollars and hidden from our elected representatives and oversight bodies,\" one of the witnesses stated during the hearing.\n\nAARO was specifically named as being complicit in the cover-up during this hearing. \"AARO is unable, or perhaps unwilling, to bring forward the truth about the government's activities concerning UAPs,\" Representative Nancy Mace (R-South Carolina) said during the hearing's opening remarks. \"I'm disturbed that AARO itself lacks transparency; even its budget is kept from the public. So if there is no 'there' there, then why are we spending money on it? And by how much? Why the secrecy?\""

        "article_content": "Advertisement\n\nTwinMind, founded by former Google X employees, is building an AI assistant to better understand you.\n\nThe founders believe memory is key and something that rival products like OpenAI's ChatGPT lack.\n\nThe startup said it has raised over $2.5 million and was most recently valued at $30 million.\n\nA startup formed by a handful of former Googlers \u2014 specifically Google X, the skunkworks lab that explores sci-fi moonshot ideas \u2014 is coming out of stealth.\n\nNamed TwinMind, its app would function as an AI assistant that lives in your smartphone and always listens. Its founders like to compare it to Jarvis, the AI designed by Marvel's Tony Stark: It's constantly learning what you're doing and talking about and then uses that information to better understand you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwinMind founder and CEO Daniel George said the company raised over $2.5 million this year in two rounds, the latest giving TwinMind a $30 million post-money valuation. Notable investors to date include Oracle's chief AI scientist, Dan Roth; a Rocketship VC founding partner, Anand Rajaraman; and Michael Liou, an early investor in Robinhood and Zapier.\n\nTwinMind is emerging into a competitive market filled with chatbots galore. George told Business Insider he believes the idea of an AI assistant that learns and retains information about users could help set TwinMind apart.\n\nWhile other AI assistants and chatbots, such as Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, are improving at memory, they're still not very good at it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you had your own Jarvis, why would you Google? Why would you ask ChatGPT?\" George told BI. \"None of these other tools capture you. None of them understand you. They don't understand what's happening in your life.\"\n\nTwinMind would run in the background of your phone, store audio in the short term, and transcribe it to text, which would go into TwinMind's memory bank. Then, users could open the app and see a readout of their day broken down into key moments.\n\nYou could also ask it questions. Because TwinMind is learning about you, what you've done, and the people you've spent your day with, it aims to pull all that information in, allowing you to talk to TwinMind in a way that feels more natural and without having to add heaps of context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup is also rolling out a web browser extension, which (with permission) could see what users are browsing online and capture it in memory. By integrating calendars and Gmail, users could also ask TwinMind to draft emails. That's something you can already do with other chatbots, of course, but TwinMind's edge here would be drawing on all that memory it holds of the user, George said.\n\n\"You just go in there and, say, write your marketing email. And it knows everything about me, who my cofounders are, what my company is, what we have done before,\" said George. \"Imagine Grammarly, but instead of correcting grammar, it actually writes it based on all the memories and context.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nWolverine origins\n\nAt Google X, George was the first machine-learning scientist working on Wolverine, a hearing-wearable project first reported on by Business Insider in 2021. That project has since spun out into a startup named Iyo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched in late 2022, George was working at JPMorgan with TwinMind cofounder and chief technology officer Sunny Tang, a Google X alum.\n\nHe said the two watched as colleagues started using AI chatbots in meetings. The pair hacked together a crude chatbot of their own that could transcribe meetings and answer questions about what was being said. The idea evolved into the startup ThirdEar, but they changed the name to TwinMind because someone else owned the ThirdEar domain name. George said the team also felt the name didn't reflect the visual elements they were building, such as the Chrome extension.\n\nTwinMind does most of its processing locally on the phone but could connect to the cloud if it needed to answer a question or if the user wanted an improved AI experience, George said. TwinMind plans to offer a free app version with a $20-a-month tier for users who want access to more advanced large language models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, it raises some questions about privacy. George said that because TwinMind does not capture images and only transcribes the audio, it falls under the same category of assistants as Siri or Alexa.\n\nPerhaps the more impressive feat here will be on the hardware side.\n\n\"The main innovation is figuring out how to get this thing running all day, in your pocket, without draining your battery, [and with] all the Apple walled garden stuff,\" George said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the team figured it out, and the TwinMind app could run for 12 hours nonstop in the background before running out the battery.\n\nThe team has just opened its seed round, and George said they're looking to raise at least $5 million. The company is also telling potential investors about its future plans, which include making the switch between phone and desktop more seamless so that TwinMind feels more embedded in users' lives.\n\nGeorge said more than 2,000 early testers have already provided feedback, and the team plans to launch the app this week on Product Hunt. It will be available first on the iPhone and as a Chrome extension, with Android and Mac apps to follow next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are sure that in a couple of years, everyone is going to have a personalized AI companion that knows their whole life and has access to all of the world's knowledge on the internet,\" George told BI. \"And that would be the way people access information. Not through Google.\""

This report is based on an EDUCAUSE QuickPoll. QuickPolls enable us to rapidly gather, analyze, and share input from our community about specific emerging topics.Footnote1\n\nFor the purposes of this QuickPoll, we offer the following definitions:\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI): We use the definition of AI established by the U.S. National Artificial Intelligence Act of 2020: \"A machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.\" Please note that this definition includes, but is not limited to, generative AI.\n\nWe use the definition of AI established by the U.S. National Artificial Intelligence Act of 2020: \"A machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.\" Please note that this definition includes, but is not limited to, generative AI. Communication applications: The variety of tools used for communication across campus (videoconferencing, voice over IP phone service, instant messaging, chatbots, etc.).\n\nThe Challenge\n\nAs the recently published EDUCAUSE Top 10 indicates, college and university officials are looking for ways to simplify administrative tasks as well as smooth the student journey. Educators and students are looking to AI to help with these tasks, and integrating AI tools in communication applications presents both opportunities and challenges that need to be carefully navigated. AI is already being added to many of these tools, and institutions will have to decide how to prioritize implementing the features available to promote efficiency and productivity for administration, education, and research. Institutions will also have to balance the financial and human-resource costs of using and putting these tools into practice against the potential benefits they can provide. The biases of AI and its technological limitations will require staff and students to keep an eye on the outputs of these tools. Addressing these challenges requires planning, continuous monitoring, and a continued commitment to ethical AI practices in education.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nRespondents expect AI to improve efficiencies for most groups across institutions, especially by providing summaries and post-meeting suggestions from videoconferencing. Data security and data privacy are the most cited important features when considering the addition of AI tools to communications applications. Respondents are looking to AI to help improve accessibility for users with disabilities, while chatbots present an opportunity for institutions to provide important information to students, faculty, and staff whenever and wherever they are. Respondents reported numerous ways chatbots might be able to help function as personalized tutors, assist with low-level IT help desk issues, and answer questions on admissions, financial aid, institutional policy, and more. Overall, hopes are high that the addition of AI tools to communications applications will improve productivity and experiences for users across campus.\n\nThe Data: Use and Efficiency\n\nMost institutions are already using AI in communication tools. A majority of respondents (71%) said their institution is currently using AI tools/features that are included in communications applications (see figure 1). Of the 29% of respondents who didn't know or said that their institution is not currently using AI in these tools, a majority (68%) indicated that their institution is likely to begin using AI in these tools within the next 12 months, with almost a third (31%) saying future use is very likely, and slightly more (37%) saying future use is somewhat likely (see figure 2).\n\nFigure 1. Percentage of Institutions Currently Using AI in Communications Applications\n\nFigure 2. Likelihood Institution Will Begin Using AI in Communications Applications within the Next 12 Months\n\nRespondents expect improved efficiency across campus from AI. A majority of respondents said that the use of AI tools in communications applications would lead to some or a lot of improvement in professional or academic efficiency for staff (90%), faculty (85%), students (78%), and researchers (72%) (see figure 3). Interestingly, while respondents anticipate a greater boost in efficiency for staff and faculty members, uncertainty was much higher for researchers and students\u2014these groups had the most \"don't know\" responses (22% and 13%, respectively).\n\nFigure 3. Anticipated Improvements in Efficiency from Using AI, by Group\n\nThe Data: Important Features and Benefits\n\nPrivacy and security are at the forefront. Respondents were asked to select features that are important for them when considering AI tools and capabilities in communication applications. The two highest-ranked features were data privacy and data security (76% and 75% of respondents, respectively; see figure 4). This result is not surprising, given other EDUCAUSE research indicating that data privacy and security are among the leading factors driving institutions' selection of third-party services and providers.Footnote2 It is also worth noting that although accessibility ranked mid-pack on the list of features (selected by 56% of respondents), upcoming regulations under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act might make the accessibility of AI tools a more pressing issue in the near future.Footnote3\n\nFigure 4. Important Features of AI Tools\n\nRespondents expect to see the most benefits for staff and faculty. The adoption of AI-powered technologies in communications applications could lead to a wide range of benefits. The two most-selected benefits were related to staff and faculty use: summaries of videoconferencing meetings and suggestions for next steps after meetings (79% and 60%, respectively; see figure 5). Student-related benefits related to videoconferencing ranked third and fourth, selected by 55% and 49% of respondents, respectively. This ranking aligns with the finding that respondents believe staff and faculty are the stakeholders who stand to see the most improvement in their efficiency by using AI (see figure 3). Overall, this gap in interest between staff/faculty and student use could be due to differences in goals (i.e., educators might prefer that students generate their own summaries and action plans) or differences in risk (i.e., educators might be more concerned about privacy and security for student data). Voice and sentiment analysis ranked lowest on the list, selected by just 11% of respondents, possibly related to the higher education community's concerns about AI being used to simulate human judgment.Footnote4\n\nFigure 5. Expected Benefits from AI\n\nThe Data: Chatbots\n\nRespondents see use cases for chatbots, but their trust only goes so far. Asked in an open-ended question to describe use cases for chatbots that would be helpful, respondents most commonly highlighted low-level, frontline web tasks and inquiries for which chatbots could provide basic information and guidance (see figure 6). This might include information about the institution for prospective students; directing web users to the relevant pages, persons, or departments they're searching for; information on institutional policies; or tier-1 help desk inquiries from students or faculty.\n\nFigure 6. Common Expected Uses of AI Chatbots\n\nSome respondents did highlight more advanced chatbot uses, potentially elevating chatbots to the role of an \"assistant\" engaged in more meaningful activities. This could include using chatbots as \"study buddies\" that provide students with academic assistance and personalized \"nudges\" for their coursework; engaging with chatbots as ideation partners in thinking through project plans or course design; getting help in writing emails and other communications; and summarizing meetings and other data inputs.\n\nFor many institutional leaders and staff, however, the jury may simply still be out on whether and how chatbots can make meaningful contributions to the institution's work. Only 19% of respondents, for example, reported being very comfortable with chatbots handling student service inquiries (see figure 7). As one respondent observed, \"No so-called 'AI' would ever replace one-to-one communication. Personal one-to-one communication is part of our institutional identity and one of our institutional strengths.\"\n\nFigure 7. Comfort with Chatbot Applications Handling Student Services Inquiries\n\nPromising Practices\n\nHow AI can better serve the needs of students. Respondents were asked how AI in communication applications can better serve students. In open-ended responses, several promising areas of use/support were identified:\n\nSimple academic tasks such as outlining, grammar correction, and translation\n\nAccessibility and inclusivity through functions such as more accurate captioning and descriptive audio, more on-demand tools for students with disabilities, and time management assistance\n\nPersonalization and flexibility through 24/7 access to chatbots or other AI tools to help plan academic progress and career goals, answer questions, and find resources\n\nClassroom assistance, including functions such as providing lecture summaries and developing practice study materials\n\nHelping students who have to go through repetitive or complex admissions or financial aid processes\n\nHow AI can better serve the needs of staff, faculty, and researchers. When asked about other groups on campus, the open-ended responses identified more ways AI might serve users:\n\nImproving clarity and accuracy of notes and communications\n\nReducing administrative load by assisting with scheduling, responding to emails, and summarizing meetings and readings\n\nHelping researchers with academic referencing and citations, as well as with identifying/summarizing relevant research articles\n\nAnswering questions about available services and policies (e.g., HR policies, facilities, campus safety)\n\nAssisting with project management by keeping track of next steps and tasks\n\nAll QuickPoll results can be found on the EDUCAUSE QuickPolls web page.

        "article_content": "Yahoo Mail is getting a new makeover. Last week, the company announced that it is redesigning the app with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI). It now offers new features such as summarising messages and helping users compose emails as well as letting them sort and categorise their emails. Apart from the AI features, the app is also introducing a messaging-inspired interface and gamification tools to make the in-app experience more engaging. Currently, the new Yahoo Mail app is available for iOS in the US.\n\nYahoo Mail Gets an AI-Powered Redesign\n\nIn a press release, Yahoo detailed the new capabilities of its new Mail app. The company said the new app is focused on helping users keep up with their inbox volume and organising the important messages. The company used AI and gamification tools to create this experience but did not reveal the AI models used to power the new features.\n\nThe new Yahoo Mail app\n\nPhoto Credit: Yahoo\n\nCalling it an AI-powered inbox, Yahoo is now offering users AI-generated one-line email summaries. The summaries are shown in a preview window and are accompanied by proposed actions which include response suggestions. The company says this method will allow users to quickly respond to emails that usually could eat up valuable time of users.\n\nOther options available in the quick-actions interface include options to view bills, access verification codes, track packages, view images and attachments, add events to the calendar, RSVP to invites and more. Additionally, users can also customise their notifications to choose the email categories that are important to them.\n\nComing to the interface, Yahoo Mail has opted for a messaging app-like experience where users can quickly enter a mail thread and reply with a few taps. It also offers an AI feature that can adjust the tonality of a message and make it appear more professional, friendly, formal, or concise.

Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson and the late Harold Ramis starred as Manhattan-based paranormal investigators in the 1984 action-horror comedy movie.\n\nThey came back for Ghostbusters II in 1989, and they delighted fans in the 2021 reboot, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, where Aykroyd, Murray and Hudson reunited to honor their friend Harold Ramis. They came back once again this year for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, and though it was a welcome return, it could be the last time they return.\n\nAykroyd was asked by the New York Post, while promoting his History Channel series The UnBelievable With Dan Aykroyd, if he saw himself returning to Ghostbusters films in the future. He responded:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that coming. I don\u2019t see where they would need us to carry it on. They\u2019ve got a whole new cast, and they\u2019ve got whole new ideas.\u201d\n\nThe latest installments in the franchise took place in Oklahoma and New York City, and they starred Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace and Carrie Coon.\n\nAykroyd went on to say about the franchise\u2019s direction, \u201cI think probably they\u2019re going to move on to advancing it beyond the originals, which they should.\u201d\n\nWhile Frozen Empire wasn\u2019t a strong critical nor commercial hit, director Gil Kenan expressed plans for additional films alongside writer-producer Jason Reitman, though nothing concrete has been announced.\n\nvia: Deadline"

        "source": "Her Campus",
        "article_content": "This article is written by a student writer from the Her Campus at UC Irvine chapter.\n\nSpooky season is over, but this conversation is just beginning. Why is it that movies like the Smile series, overdone with graphic gore scenes and predictable jump scares, just don\u2019t invoke the same fear as films more simply recorded on a mobile device? Allow me to explain.\n\n1) I don\u2019t relate to you.\n\nOutrageous plot lines, such as the drug-ridden pop-star protagonist in Smile 2, force the viewer to deviate from the narrative. In stark contrast, the six main characters featured in the Skype-call-turned-scary movie Unfriended, encounter issues regarding bullying, suicide, social hierarchy, and infidelity. Despite the running time of Smile 2 dwarfing that of Unfriended, I learned and empathized more with each of the six characters than I did with the one.\n\n2) What else is coming?\n\nOnce you see it, you can\u2019t unsee it. Something or someone in the corner\u2014it was probably just nothing. Or was it? We mustn\u2019t underestimate the value of gradual jump scares, discrete to disastrous. No franchise executes this concept better than Paranormal Activity. With an almost voyeuristic quality, the discrete introduction of jump scares excels at keeping momentum and engineering the fright to feel like it is happening right next to the viewer. This creeping terror, amplified by the homemade style of mobile-recording footage, keeps the viewer on edge, not knowing exactly when or where the next scare will come, dreading this continuous and uncomfortable experience. What begins as a minor inconvenience, a lamp knocked over, a dog barking too loud, quickly snowballs into your worst nightmare: chandelier collapses on the floor, total demonic possession, and more!\n\nThis kind of unpredictable jump-scare will forever surpass the jarring rather than genuinely unsettling attempt of films like the Smile series. Designed to deliver an adrenaline rush, the coupled abruptness forces me to undermine the build-up of suspense. It feels more mechanical and about delivering a reaction than creating a lingering sense of dread.\n\n3) We\u2019re all just one big happy family!\n\nThere\u2019s one subconscious thing we don\u2019t notice, but it completely alters how we absorb that 90-minute fear fest. That thing is the focus on a small, consistent group of characters\u2014typically a couple or a family\u2014creating intimacy and isolation. Best executed in the Paranormal Activity franchise, this intensifies the horror because, unlike in films with rotating characters, the viewer can\u2019t escape the anxiety or unease growing in the house or apartment. Stakes skyrocket because the emotional bond with the characters grows over time; we feel their distress as if we\u2019re a part of their big happy family. Viewers don\u2019t just see a sequence of scary events\u2014they live through the psychological unraveling of the family, making it more personal.\n\nConversely, Smile shifts the focus to new characters and various settings more frequently, diluting the emotional investment. Constantly introducing new faces makes it harder for the viewer to form that lasting emotional connection. Because these characters are fleeting, the sense of isolation and shared experience with them isn\u2019t as strong. You\u2019re often left with a sense that you\u2019re simply passing through the lives of the people being targeted, rather than witnessing a gradual unraveling of their lives. As a result, the horror feels less intimate and more external\u2014it\u2019s a spectacle, but one that we\u2019re not truly living through alongside the characters.\n\nAbove all, there is a definite need for an increased release of films with a structure similar to Unfriended and Paranormal Activity. I demand more of this raw, unpolished feel, and this authenticity that comes with it. The shakiness, the low-quality visuals, and the sense of witnessing something secret resonates so deeply today that the line between reality and fiction continues to blur. The least you could do is take a look and tap into the unknown and the unexplainable."

But it has not quite gone to plan so far.\n\nHolloway has yet to win a league game as Swindon manager - leaving the side sitting 22nd in League Two. Their latest outing saw them draw 2-2 with Accrington Stanley.\n\nSwindon have also been beset with misfortune on the injury front, with captain Ollie Clarke becoming the latest to pick up an issue as he ruptured a tendon in his ankle during training. And Holloway believes that paranormal activity could have something to do with the situation that the club find themselves in.\n\nSpeaking with BBC Radio Wiltshire, he said: \"I'm absolutely devastated so I'm going to try and cleanse the training ground area because people are telling me it's haunted. There's a graveyard somewhere near. Honestly, I'm not joking.\n\n\"I think our training ground is very close to an ancient burial site so I'm going to get my wife to come up and say sorry to all these people and hopefully we'll have a bit more luck.\"\n\nAnd while Holloway is aiming to find a resolution to the ghostly goings-on, he has stopped short of following Barry Fry \u2019s example. The former Birmingham boss allegedly had a wee in all four corners of the St Andrews\u2019 pitch in an effort to lift an apparent curse put on the club.\n\n\"I don't want to do what he did, I think he had to urinate on the corners of his pitch but I'm going to get my wife to come up with her sage,\" Holloway added.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\nWhat's the strangest reason you've ever heard for a defeat? Share your thoughts in the comments below\n\n\"I've done the Glastonbury stuff and the hail and welcome - great if you believe it. Do I? Really I'm not sure but I'm going to get it just to help because there's some strange things happening.\"\n\nSwindon have an excellent chance to earn their first victory of the Holloway era this weekend. They take on bottom of the table Morecambe at home on Saturday afternoon.\n\nA win could potentially see Holloway\u2019s side move four points clear of the relegation zone. But a defeat could see them slump to the bottom of the table.\n\nThe side have been in League Two since their relegation at the end of the 2020/21 campaign. The highest they have finished since then has been sixth the following campaign. Swindon finished 19th last term - nine points clear of relegation. The club has never dropped out of the Football League in their history.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Lead researcher Mengyuan Xiao believes that this discovery could significantly reshape our understanding of how the early universe developed, particularly in its first few hundred million years.\n\nJWST sheds new light on galaxy evolution with red monsters challenging traditional models\n\nRole of JWST in cosmic discovery\n\nNew insights to the early universe\n\nAlso Read |\n\nIn an astonishing new revelation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered the existence of three enormous \"red monster\" galaxies, each with a mass approximately 100 billion times that of our Sun. These galaxies, which formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, are forcing astronomers to rethink everything they know about early galaxy formation and cosmic evolution.The newly discovered galaxies are truly ancient, over 12.8 billion years old, dating back to a time when the universe was only 1 billion years old. This period, known as the \"cosmic dawn,\" marks the early stages of galaxy formation and the first generations of stars.These massive galaxies challenge the current models of how galaxies should form in the early universe. According to the prevailing theories, galaxies should take much longer to grow to such enormous sizes, with star formation occurring at a more gradual pace. But the \"red monsters\" defy these predictions, suggesting that our understanding of galactic evolution might be fundamentally flawed.The three galaxies discovered by JWST are not only massive but also exhibit some highly unusual properties. The term \"red monsters\" refers to their distinctive red glow, which is visible in the infrared spectrum captured by JWST\u2019s Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam). This red glow occurs because the galaxies are so distant that their light has been stretched (or \"redshifted\") due to the expansion of the universe. This stretching causes the light from these galaxies to shift into the infrared part of the spectrum.The red colour of these galaxies is also indicative of their age and the nature of their star formation. In the early universe, cosmic dust was far more abundant, which often obscured the light from forming stars. The JWST\u2019s ability to peer through this dust and capture the infrared light offers us an unprecedented view of galaxies that existed when the universe was still in its infancy.One of the most surprising aspects of these \"red monster\" galaxies is the sheer speed and efficiency with which they formed stars. Around 80% of their gas has been converted into stars\u2014a rate of star formation that vastly exceeds that of typical galaxies today, which convert only about 20% of their gas into stellar matter.This high conversion rate implies that these early galaxies were extraordinarily efficient star factories. They appear to have bypassed some of the natural limits on star formation that we currently understand. Normally, factors like gas availability, temperature, and the dynamics of interstellar matter constrain how quickly stars can form in a galaxy. But these galaxies, known for their dense and rapid star formation, seem to have shattered those limitations.Stijn Wuyts, an astronomer at the University of Bath, described these galaxies as a \"tantalising puzzle.\" Their rapid formation challenges the conventional wisdom about the time and conditions required for such massive growth. These findings suggest that there might be unknown factors at play in early galaxy evolution that we have yet to discover.At the core of this discovery is the question: how did these galaxies form so quickly and grow to such massive sizes in the early universe? These \"red monster\" galaxies, formed within just one billion years of the Big Bang, provide a stark contrast to the more gradual process of galaxy formation that was previously believed to be the norm.This rapid growth raises several important implications for our understanding of the universe's infancy:The discovery of these galaxies is part of a larger trend where JWST is revealing previously unknown aspects of the early universe. By studying galaxies that formed just after the Big Bang, astronomers hope to piece together a clearer picture of how galaxies evolved over time.The red monsters\u2019 rapid growth and massive size offer a unique opportunity to explore how the first galaxies might have differed from those in later cosmic epochs. Theories on galaxy formation must now account for the possibility of faster-than-expected growth, which could change the way scientists approach everything from star formation rates to the conditions of the early universe.JWST is providing astronomers with an unparalleled tool to study the deep universe. Its advanced infrared capabilities are able to detect light from the earliest galaxies, offering a view into a time when the universe was still in its infancy. This unprecedented observational power allows scientists to study cosmic phenomena that were previously unreachable, opening up new frontiers in astrophysics.As Wuyts puts it, \"JWST is launching a new era of cosmic exploration.\" The telescope\u2019s ability to peer into the farthest reaches of space\u2014and time\u2014has already led to a revolution in our understanding of the universe\u2019s early stages. The discovery of the \"red monster\" galaxies is just the beginning, and astronomers are eager to learn more about the mysteries these galaxies hold.With these discoveries, the next phase of investigation will involve deeper studies into the structure and formation of these galaxies. JWST, in combination with other instruments like the ALMA telescope in Chile, will continue to probe these galaxies, focusing on their internal dynamics and the processes that allowed them to grow so quickly.The findings from the James Webb Space Telescope are not just about discovering distant galaxies\u2014they are changing the very way we think about the universe. As astronomers continue to analyse these discoveries, they may unlock new insights into the nature of the early universe, the formation of galaxies, and the processes that shaped the cosmos as we know it.These \"red monster\" galaxies are forcing astronomers to rewrite the rules of cosmic evolution, and JWST is at the forefront of this exciting new chapter in the story of the universe."

        "article_content": "Google may be working to merge Chrome OS into its Android operating system to strengthen the value proposition of the software for its best Android tablets. While rumors circulate about Google\u2019s Pixel Tablet 2, experts speculate on how the brand can use future devices to compete with Apple\u2019s stronghold in the tablet market with its iPad line.\n\nSources told Android Authority that Google may be closer to unifying its Android and ChromeOS operating systems for the benefit of bridging this gap. Not only would Android gain highlight features from ChromeOS but in the future, some of the best Chromebooks may also run under a reimagined Android OS, that is more attuned for entertainment as well as productivity. The source added this could be a project that takes several years to unfold.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIf the project came to fruition, a blend of Android tablets and Chromebooks running Android could potentially push the software market share in Google\u2019s favor. There is also a Pixel Laptop rumored to be released running an Android operating system.\n\nDespite being a software and services titan in many different arenas, Google has been unable to truly challenge Apple when it comes to tablet market share. Many hardware brands, including Samsung, Amazon, Lenovo, OnePlus, and Xiaomi partner with Google to use the Android operating system on their tablets. Additionally, Google introduced its own Pixel Tablet in 2023. Even so, Apple still dominates the tablet market with a single tablet line, which takes up 55% of the global market share with iOS, 45% of the market goes to Android devices, and 0.11% goes to Linux in October 2024, according to StatCounter.\n\nPixel Tablet 2 rumors suggest the device could be released in 2025, which could make it ineligible for the long-standing project. However, subsequent Pixel Tablet models could potentially be released with the fused Android and ChromeOS system, according to Android Headlines.\n\nThough Google has not shared any official details about plans to merge Chrome OS and Android, the brand did discuss in June, how it would implement parts of Android\u2019s tech stack into ChromeOS. The publication noted that the stack included \u201cAndroid Linux kernel and Android frameworks,\u201d with apps, features, and extensions that could be a part of the project.\n\nAndroid Headlines noted that Google isn\u2019t the only brand that has blended operating systems on a single device. The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid notably works as an Android tablet but morphs into a Windows laptop when connected to a keyboard. Brands including HP and Dell have also previously released similar products to the market."
