        "article_content": "f5ve have released their otherworldly new single \u2018UFO\u2019 today (October 17). Ahead of the song\u2019s release, the Japanese girl group spoke to NME about the story behind the new single, their remarkable social media presence and how they\u2019re bringing Japan\u2019s unique subcultures to the world.\n\n\u2018UFO\u2019 comes shortly after f5ve \u2013 originally known as SG5 \u2013 hit the big time with their May 2024 single \u2018Lettuce\u2019, a quirky but scathing diss track to a former lover that\u2019s since become a viral sensation on TikTok. Over a video call from Tokyo, the girl group told NME that \u2018UFO\u2019 tells the story of a girl who is exceptionally skilled at claw machines, which were popularised in Japan during the \u201970s and have since become mainstays at arcades around the world. \u201cThe people watching her start thinking, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s so good, she must be an alien\u2019,\u201d Kaede said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really fun and unique story.\u201d\n\nThe futuristic music video for \u2018UFO\u2019 was filmed in Akihabara \u2013 which member Miyuu describes as the \u201cstarting ground\u201d of Japan\u2019s idol scene \u2013 and finds the girl group performing inside a gacha ball, each of them caked in pale makeup and eerie all-white contact lenses. They soon arrive on earth disguised as humans, but their unnaturally large pupils, awkward movements and fascination with claw machines soon give them away as extraterrestrial beings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the US, the word \u2018UFO\u2019 makes people think of aliens, but in Japan, it brings to mind things like claw machines and gacha games,\u201d Miyuu said of their alien-like appearance in the music video, explaining that \u201cit\u2019s a playful word association that blends both Japanese and English\u201d which takes inspiration from UFO-related connotations in each language.\n\nDespite being a global-facing act, f5ve unanimously agree on the importance of showcasing Japanese culture in its truest form in their music and visuals. \u201cI believe it\u2019s going to spark a revolution,\u201d said Rui, the youngest of the group. \u201cWe really love and have a lot of confidence in our music and our activities, and we are proud of who we are. We want to bring Japan to the world.\u201d\n\nTake their July single \u2018Underground\u2019, an energetic dance anthem about escaping from societal expectations. Its music video begins with scenes from Tokyo\u2019s busy subway network, with salarymen filing in and out of high-speed trains on their daily commutes. Tired of the monotony on the surface, they escape into the vibrant underground rave scene where they find their place in a sea of colourful outfits and neon lightsticks.\n\nRecommended\n\n\u201cI believe that we stand out because we\u2019re able to really incorporate Japanese culture [in our music] and represent it in an authentic way,\u201d said Sayaka, referencing the \u2018Underground\u2019 and \u2018UFO\u2019 visuals. \u201cI think something unique about us is that we are globally transmitting Japanese culture, which we don\u2019t think any other group is doing right now.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kaede shared that the girl group \u201ctake pride\u201d in their Japanese roots. \u201cWe want to spread the best aspects of J-pop and Japanese culture to the world, and no girl group has really done that before. As representatives of Japan, we want to share our culture and show the real side of who we are to other countries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor decades, the Japanese music industry has been viewed as unusually insular. While a number of acts, especially in recent years, have managed to break through and find global success \u2013 such as YOASOBI, XG and ATARASHII GAKKO!, among others \u2013 few approach their careers with international audiences in mind, at least not the way their K-pop counterparts do. While those that do, Kaede added, seldom place Japanese culture at the forefront of their craft.\n\n\u201cThis might be something culturally embedded in Japanese people, but I think we aren\u2019t as confident in representing our culture and aren\u2019t aware of how much people overseas are interested in it,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so [some artists] might think that whenever they do something for overseas fans, the content has to be catered to them; the songs have to be in English, they have to do things that are already popular overseas.\u201d\n\nWhile chasing global trends might be a safer shot at success, f5ve are reluctant to do so at the expense of their identity. \u201cI think [following trends] ends up diluting the Japanese cultural aspect,\u201d said Kaede. Instead, they trust that their music will find the right audience while the rest of the world catches up. \u201c[We are] transmitting Japanese culture as it is [and] I think it has hit audiences that have always been interested in Japanese culture and music.\u201d\n\nA huge part of being an international facing group, f5ve shared, is the way they interact with fans on social media. While not every member of the act is fluent in English just yet, they have made it a point to bond with their audience, quickly picking up on popular internet slang and memes. This, in turn, has helped them gain a reputation for being one of the most authentic (and chronically online) J-pop acts around \u2013 and it\u2019s one they\u2019ve embraced whole-heartedly.\n\n\u201cThe reactions from overseas fans are really unique, and they always bring a lot of energy with their support,\u201d Kaede shared with an excited laugh. \u201cWhat stands out to me is how they comment things like \u2018Slay mother\u2019, \u2018Queen\u2019, \u2018Face economy, face card\u2019 to compliment us. Like, I have a bob now, so they said things like \u2018Your bob is fire! Your bob is bobbing!\u2019 to compliment my hairstyle. I find it so inspiring how they express it in such a creative way.\u201d\n\nRuri even joked about how the unfettered way they use social media \u2013 \u201cOur account has less official information than other groups, and we comment on a lot of fans\u2019 posts,\u201d she points out \u2013 has fans confused on whether the accounts really belong to the girl group. \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t think it\u2019s an official account,\u201d she said.\n\nSocial media savvy aside, Ruri believes that much of f5ve\u2019s bond with their fans (called hi-5) is being \u201ctrue to ourselves\u201d. She explained: \u201cEven while we are doing these unique things, we love music and performing. So being honest, having confidence and expressing how much fun we are having. I think that translates directly to fans and creates a strong bond, which I hope will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nAlthough f5ve remained tight-lipped about what\u2019s to come for them, Rui shared her desire to release a catchy anime-inspired track down the line. \u201cAnd we want to sing about Japanese drinking culture,\u201d she added, to which the rest of the group exclaimed: \u201cWe love to drink!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say much yet, but if I could give a little hint, maybe 2025, there will be a big release from f5ve. We have many songs recorded, so please look forward to it,\u201d said Ruri. Wearing a bright smile, Kaede boldly declared: \u201c2025 might be the year of f5ve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a lot that we want to accomplish with the songs that we currently have. And so we hope that the fans and everyone can look forward to our activities next year and everything that we want to show to the world!\u201d"

        "article_content": "The psychology-based digital health care platform Noom announced an AI-powered feature on Thursday that aims to address one of the major side effects of popular weight loss drugs: lean muscle mass loss.\n\n\n\nNoom launched a body scan feature on their app today, in partnership with Prism Labs, that allows users to generate a 3D avatar of their body and get accurate body composition stats \u2014 all from a 10-second video of their body taken with a smartphone.\n\nThe feature aims to help users track their muscle mass while they\u2019re losing weight.\n\nLast month, Noom joined other digital health care companies such as Hims & Hers (HIMS), Ro, and Sesame in offering more affordable alternatives to branded weight loss drugs by introducing an off-brand version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy. Noom had already been offering prescriptions to branded weight loss medications since 2023.\n\nWhile these drugs have been proven to be highly effective for shedding pounds, they can also lead to lean muscle loss. One clinical study of semaglutide found that, on average, 40% of the weight lost was muscle mass, while the remaining 60% was fat. Several drugmakers are now working on next-gen medications to address this issue.\n\nNoom\u2019s solution is a behavior-focused weight loss drug companion program designed to prevent muscle loss. It encourages users to increase their protein intake and incorporate resistance training into their routine.\n\nHowever, Noom CEO Geoff Cook told Quartz that the company still needed a way to help users measure the program\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n\u201cYou need to be able to see a metric to mind it,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou may be more likely to engage in the protein eating and the resistance training if you see that you are sustaining your muscle mass and your lean mass while losing weight.\u201d\n\nPrism Labs can use the data collected from the 10-second video \u2014 about 150 photos \u2014 and use AI to deliver surprisingly accurate body composition measurements.\n\n\n\nA study from Texas Tech University found that body scans are highly consistent, with an error rate of \u00b10.20% for body fat percentage and \u00b10.45% for body circumferences in repeated measurements under the same conditions.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, lean mass is really one of the most important measurables that you can have,\u201d said Prism Labs CEO Steve Raymond. \u201cBut until now, it\u2019s been sort of a niche thing that hasn\u2019t been available to most people because you need expensive hardware.\u201d\n\nIn addition to metrics such as body fat percentage, fat mass, waist-to-hip ratio, and lean mass, Noom will also provide users with a comprehensive health report that includes their ideal measurements based on age and gender, as well as how they compare with national averages.\n\nThe app will even allow users to see what their body will look like once they meet their goals.\n\n\u201cTelling somebody that they need to change the number on the scale can be extremely demotivating because that might be something that they\u2019ve heard over and over again and that they\u2019ve struggled with,\u201d Raymond said. \u201cAnd so reframing the goal around a more informative number is empowering and motivating.\u201d\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

        "article_content": "With Galaxy AI, Google Gemini, and Apple Intelligence, companies are experimenting with various concepts to enhance the AI experience on our smartphones. Imagine a smartphone that predicts your needs, seamlessly tweaking its settings to match your preferences without lifting a finger. This is the vision Samsung is pursuing with its ambitious plan to integrate AI deeply into its Galaxy smartphones, potentially replacing the traditional Settings menu.\n\nWhile this radical shift promises to deliver a personalized user experience, it raises questions about user control, privacy, and unpredictability. Let's uncover the exciting possibilities and potential pitfalls of Samsung's AI-driven approach to smartphone settings.\n\nThe promise of AI personalization\n\nSamsung's rumored move to replace the traditional Settings app with an AI-powered one presents exciting possibilities and significant challenges.\n\nA simplified user experience\n\nsamsung galaxy s23 fe battery settings screen\n\nThe One UI Settings app is crowded, with countless customization options, tweaks, and hidden menus. Navigating through layers of menus can be tedious. Here is where Galaxy AI can come into play. It could understand natural languages like \"Disable Always on Display,\" \"Open Secure Folder Settings,\" and \"Install the pending updates,\" and complete the process faster.\n\nThe Galaxy AI can also prioritize frequently used options to dynamically rearrange the Settings menu, bringing them to the top for easy access. Samsung integrated similar functionality into Tizen OS (soon to be rebranded as One UI) on its smart TVs. The system brings commonly used settings to the forefront so that users can adjust their TV settings instantly.\n\nProactive suggestions\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 showing its settings menu\n\nThe AI could learn user preferences and automatically adjust settings based on context, such as location, time of day, or activity. Picture Galaxy AI automatically generating personalized routines and modes, saving you from navigating numerous menus to set up a customized one.\n\nIt can also show suggestions based on your activities. For example, if you use the Camera app a lot, Galaxy AI can suggest assigning the Camera app to the double press action on the side key. If your Galaxy phone slows down, the AI bot can suggest an option to activate Restart when needed under Settings and reboot the device. The possibilities are endless.\n\nThe potential pitfalls\n\nGalaxy AI taking over the Settings menu raises some concerns.\n\nLearning curve\n\nIf Samsung eliminates the Settings menu, many less tech-savvy users might find it difficult to adapt to a new way of interacting with their devices. Not everyone is astute with text prompts, and Galaxy AI's natural language processing isn't perfect.\n\nBesides, visual menus provide a clear overview of available options and their hierarchy. Text prompts, on the other hand, rely solely on language, which can be a hit-and-miss. To make matters worse, if AI misunderstands a prompt, it could lead to frustration and confusion.\n\nLoss of user control\n\nTop Galaxy AI features to try\n\nWhile intended to be helpful, AI-powered suggestions can be a nuisance. Imagine constantly receiving suggestions for settings you never use or notifications that aren't relevant to your current context.\n\nBesides, an AI-drive settings menu that frequently changes based on user needs can be problematic. After all, we rely on our memory and awareness to navigate menus quickly. If Galaxy AI changes the menu structure, it can lead to confusion and frustration. Users might struggle to find the options they need, even if they are familiar with the settings.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nA Samsung Galaxy A35 held up against a hilly landscape\n\nEven if the processing happens on the device, the Galaxy AI still needs access to potentially sensitive data to learn and make predictions. This could include user interactions, app usage, location, and sensor data.\n\nWhile on-device processing reduces the risk of data breaches during transmission, vulnerabilities in the operating system or the AI software could expose this sensitive information. Users with visual impairments may find such Settings menus difficult to navigate. Samsung should deliver an innovative and convenient setup without compromising privacy and accessibility.\n\nConvenience vs. complexity\n\nWhile Samsung's vision of AI-powered settings promises to bring personalization and convenience benefits, it's crucial to acknowledge the valid concerns surrounding user control and privacy. If the company goes down this path, it needs to strike a balance between AI assistance and user autonomy.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Samsung can deliver on the promise of AI-driven settings without compromising the user experience. If you haven't used Galaxy AI before, check out our dedicated post to find the top Galaxy AI features."

Here's what to know about the social network giant's artificial intelligence tools.\n\nMeta AI, and where you use it\n\nBeyond its use in apps, Meta AI also refers to Meta's academic research laboratory. It was formerly known as Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research before Facebook's rebranding to Meta (Facebook, the company, not the social media platform) in October 2021. It focuses on the metaverse -- hence the name Meta -- and develops AI technology to power everything from chatbots to virtual reality and augmented reality experiences.\n\nMeta AI isn't the only player in the race to integrate artificial intelligence into everyday life. Google has its own AI tools, like Google Assistant and Gemini, its free chatbot, akin to ChatGPT.\n\nWhile Google's AI focuses more on productivity like search results or managing schedules, Meta AI is embedded into your social interactions, offering assistance without you having to ask. With Meta AI, you can snap a photo and ask it to identify its details or edit the images with prompting.\n\nScreenshot by CNET\n\nSimilarly, Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri are task-oriented assistants, and ChatGPT or Snapchat's My AI help with conversational experience.\n\nBut Meta AI goes a step further blending all those features to make it the \"everyday experience,\" rather than a standalone tool. And so, while those other utility tools feel more like something you consciously use, Meta AI quietly shapes how you connect with others or create content.\n\nIt's almost sneaky in how it seamlessly integrates into social platforms people use daily, making AI tools harder to avoid. By simply typing \"@\" followed by Meta AI, you can summon the assistant in chats (even group chats) to offer suggestions, answer questions or edit images.\n\nThis AI integration also extends to the search functions within Meta's apps, making it more intuitive and easier to find content and explore topics based on what you see in your feed -- what Meta calls a \"contextual experience.\"\n\nFollowing ChatGPT's path, Meta AI now has natural voice conversations. It is multilingual, speaking English, French, German, Hindi, Hindi-Romanized script, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. Soon, you'll also be able to choose from various celebrity voices for the assistant, including John Cena and Kristen Bell.\n\nMeta AI is currently available in 21 countries outside of the US: Argentina, Australia, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana, India, Jamaica, Malawi, Mexico, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\nThough Meta AI isn't available in the EU, the company says it might later join the EU's AI Pact. The AI Act requires companies to provide \"detailed summaries\" of the data used to train their models -- a requirement Meta has been hesitant to meet, likely due to its history with data privacy lawsuits.\n\nGlasses as a new AI device\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg introduced new multimodal features, powered by its open-source Llama 3.2 models, during the Connect event in September, where Meta's team emphasized the future of computing and human connection.\n\nOne of the biggest announcements from Connect 2024 was how Meta AI is integrating into everyday products like its Ray-Ban Meta glasses. These glasses can now assist users in various ways, like remembering where you parked your car (woohoo!).\n\nThe glasses can also take actions based on what you're looking at. For example, you can ask AI to make a call or scan a QR code for you.\n\nMeta\n\nOther presented products include the Meta Quest S3 version of their standalone virtual reality (VR) headset, which, after the upgrades, they now call a mixed reality headset, and Orion, their prototype of holographic AR glasses, which has been in the making for over a decade.\n\nThough Ray-Ban Meta glasses and Quest devices are available across 15 countries, including some European ones, Meta AI is currently available on those devices only in the US and Canada.\n\nLive translation\n\nMeta also announced developments in AI translation. Meta glasses will be able to translate for you in real time, so if someone speaks to you in Spanish, French or Italian, you'll be able to hear them in your ear in English.\n\nAnother major breakthrough, though still in the experimental phase, is video dubbing in Reels in Spanish and English, with automated lip-syncing. Presumably, if testing goes well, they will expand it to more languages.\n\nAI Studio\n\nFor now, this feature is available only in the US. Users and businesses will be able to create custom AI chatbots without needing extensive programming knowledge. These so-called AI characters will serve as extensions of themselves or their brands, enabling more engaging interactions with followers or customers.\n\nScreenshot by Barbara Pazur/CNET\n\nIn full transparency, all replies generated by AI will be marked as such.\n\nThe power behind Meta AI\n\nLlama (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a family of LLMs designed to understand and generate human-like text, answer questions, write and even hold conversations.\n\nLlama 3.2 is the latest version of this LLM and Meta's first open-source multimodal model, which will enable many applications that require visual understanding. Meta claims that it is \"its most advanced open-source model, with flexibility, control and state-of-the-art capabilities that rival the best closed-sourced models.\"\n\nThe new Llama 3.2 models come in two multimodal variants with 11B and 19B parameters, and text-only models with 8B and 70B parameters. Parameters are measured in billions and define how the model processes inputs, like words or images, and generates outputs by adjusting relationships between them.\n\nMeta also plans to release models with smaller parameters optimized for mobile devices and wearables like glasses.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAccording to the company, Meta AI is set to become the world's most widely used AI assistant by the end of the year. Over 400 million people interact with Meta AI monthly, with 185 million using it across Meta's products each week."

It was the ultimate moment of life imitating art.\"\n\nUnfortunately, this ancient vessel isn't capable of providing eternal youth or infinite abundance, but researchers are still very excited about the catacomb's contents.\n\n\"Little did we know that this dig might completely change what we know about the Treasury,\" says archaeologist Pearce Paul Creasman from the American Center of Research in Jordan.\n\n\"We were absolutely stunned by the revelation of this hidden chamber,\" adds Gates. \"Since nearly all of the tombs at Petra have been found empty, this is perhaps the most significant tomb ever found at Petra and a discovery of historic proportions.\"\n\nThe ancient city of Petra was half-built, half-carved into the sandstone cliffs of a desert canyon in southern Jordan over 2,000 years ago by the Nabateans, a traditionally nomadic Bedouin Arab Tribe.\n\nThe city came to be their capital, which they called Raqmu. It is now one of the new seven wonders of the world, and yet there are many mysteries surrounding the site, which was once a hub of trade between the Mediterranean, Arabia, and Asia.\n\nBy 700 CE, Petra was inexplicably abandoned, and eventually its Treasury building was emptied of artifacts.\n\nAs a result, no one really knows how old the Treasury building is or what it was used for. It's called a treasury because a sculpted urn at the top of the facade was thought to hold riches. This vessel could also, however, be a memorial to royalty.\n\n\"It's fantastic that we now have the pottery, ecofacts, and sediments to date when the Treasury was constructed,\" says environmental scientist Tim Kinnaird from the University of St Andrews.\n\n\"Previously we've worked on assumptions and conjectures \u2013 to have a definitive date will be a monumental achievement for us all.\"\n\nThe discovery of the underground chamber was made by accident, after researchers used ground-penetrating radars to assess flooding risks.\n\nArchaeologists say the tomb was most likely built as a mausoleum and crypt for King Aretas IV Philopatris at the beginning of the 1st century CE.\n\nKing Philopatris was the ruler of the Nabateans from roughly 9 BCE to 40 CE. Under his reign, what was once a community of goat and sheep herders flourished into a kingdom of wealthy merchants, allowing for the lavish construction of many buildings in Petra.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nThis inevitably drew the attention of the Romans. Around 100 CE, the powerful neighboring Empire annexed Petra and renamed it Arabia Petraea. The Romans would rule over the city for the next 300 years, after which the site was gradually abandoned.\n\nIt's not known what happened to the Nabateans after this event. It's likely that the people slowly diffused into Roman society. Much of what we do know about them comes from Roman writings.\n\n\"The discovery is of international significance, as very few complete burials from the early Nabataeans have ever been recovered from Petra before,\" explains geophysicist Richard Bates from St Andrews.\n\n\"The burials, their goods, and the human remains can all be expected to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of how Petra came to be and who the Nabataeans were.\"\n\nThe excavation of the tomb is featured in a two-part program called Excavation Unknown, part of the series Expedition Unknown, which also aired this month on Discovery Channel."

This innovative study has successfully reproduced small amounts of skin in the laboratory, paving the way for future advancements in regenerative medicine.\n\nThe Human Cell Atlas Project\n\nThis research is part of the ambitious Human Cell Atlas project, an international initiative based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge. The project aims to comprehensively map how every cell in the human body is formed. Prof. Muzlifah Haniffa, one of the project leaders, highlighted the potential benefits, stating, \u201cIt would help scientists treat diseases more effectively, but also find new ways of keeping us healthier for longer, and perhaps even keep us younger-looking.\u201d\n\nProf. Haniffa added, \u201cIf we can manipulate the skin and prevent aging, we will have fewer wrinkles.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding Skin Development\n\nResearchers are delving into how skin cells develop during early fetal stages. Initially, all human cells are identical after fertilization, but specific genes activate three weeks later, guiding stem cells to specialize and form different body parts. By pinpointing which genes turn on and when, scientists have unraveled the complex process of skin formation.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Nature, presents an instruction set for creating human skin. This revelation opens up exciting possibilities for regenerative therapies. For instance, fetal skin is known to heal without scarring, and researchers are investigating how to replicate this quality in adult skin, which could enhance surgical outcomes.\n\nInnovations in Skin Creation\n\nA significant advancement in this research includes the discovery that immune cells are essential for forming blood vessels within the skin. By mimicking these instructions in a laboratory setting, scientists have successfully activated genes to grow skin artificially from stem cells. Currently, they have produced small skin samples complete with hair follicles.\n\nProf. Haniffa stated, \u201cIf you know how to build human skin, we can use that for burns patients and that can be a way of transplanting tissue.\u201d Furthermore, creating hair follicles could lead to solutions for hair loss.\n\nA Comprehensive Understanding of Human Biology\n\nThe Human Cell Atlas project has analyzed over 100 million cells from various body parts in its eight years of operation. It has already produced draft atlases for the brain and lungs, with ongoing work on the kidney, liver, and heart.\n\nAccording to Prof. Sarah Teichmann of Cambridge University, one of the consortium\u2019s founders, the project\u2019s findings will revolutionize our understanding of human biology. She noted, \u201cIt is incredibly exciting because it is giving us new insights into physiology, anatomy, a new understanding of humans. It will lead to a rewriting of the textbooks in terms of ourselves and our tissues and organs and how they function.\u201d\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs researchers continue to unlock the genetic instructions for different body parts, they anticipate publishing more findings in the coming weeks and months, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of human development. This groundbreaking research not only holds promise for slowing the aging process but also for advancing medical treatments and tissue regeneration.\n\n(INCLUDES INPUTS FROM ONLINE SOURCES)\n\nALSO READ: Singapore Fighter Jets Escort Air India Express Plane After Bomb Threat"

According to Precedence Research, the global software market size reached $659.17 billion in 2023\u200b. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8% during 2024 \u2013 2034 to reach $2.24 trillion by \u200bthe end of the forecast period. In 2023, the North American region led the software market, holding a substantial share of 44%. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period.\n\nA key factor influencing the market is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI technologies are being integrated into software solutions to enhance efficiency and automate repetitive tasks. A study from Salesforce reveals that 85% of IT leaders expect AI to boost developer productivity over the next three years. This expectation underscores the growing recognition of AI\u2019s role in streamlining workflows and optimizing software performance.\n\nAnother significant trend is the shift towards cloud-based software. Companies are migrating from traditional on-premises solutions to cloud services due to their flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This transition allows businesses to access applications remotely and across various devices, which has become crucial in today\u2019s digital landscape.\n\nThe 2024 AlgoSec State of Network Security report highlights a notable shift towards multi-cloud environments. The research, based on surveys conducted in H2 of 2022 and 2023, evaluated major players like AWS and Microsoft Azure. It indicates that security, continuity, and compliance are key factors driving organizations to adopt cloud platforms. While cloud adoption is growing, Azure remains the most popular platform, with AWS rapidly gaining ground.\n\nThe report also reveals that the move to remote work has significantly boosted Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) deployment, dropping the percentage of organizations without SD-WAN from 55.2% in 2022 to 34% in 2023. Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) has become a popular solution for organizations by consolidating security functions into a unified cloud service. Additionally, firewall implementation has surged, with only 7.1% of respondents reporting no firewalls in 2023, down from 28.4% in 2022. This trend reflects a growing focus on securing cloud networks against external threats.\n\nWith an overview of the global software market in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024, we used stock screeners from Finviz and Yahoo Finance. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 50 largest software companies by market cap.\n\nTo narrow down our list to high-growth software stocks, we focused on companies with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in net revenue exceeding 18% over the past 5 years.\n\nNext, we focused on profitability. From this initial list of high-growth software stocks, we narrowed our choices to stocks that had positive trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income and stocks that have grown their net income positively over the past 5 years.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we consulted reputable sources such as SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into the net income CAGR and revenue CAGR over the past five years, and YCharts, which offered information on TTM net income.\n\nFinally, from this list of high-growth software stocks that met our criteria, we focused on the top 8 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 elite hedge funds. The 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024 are ranked below in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\n8 High Growth Software Stocks That Are Profitable In 2024\n\n8.
