        "article_content": "Are you tired of failed dates? Has that someone hurt you in the past? Maybe you\u2019re not even sure you\u2019re cut for a traditional relationship. Are you an individual who never really liked the idea of being with someone?\n\nWell, it\u2019s 2024 - who cares about whether you have a real-life partner or not?\n\nThese questions are what we will focus on today. Regardless of what your answer is, you\u2019re at the right place. Technology has brought us all sorts of different conveniences over the past couple of decades, but one thing that stands out is something that we haven\u2019t seen before - AI girlfriends.\n\nWhat exactly is an AI Girlfriend?\n\nWe are all witnesses to the rise of AI. We\u2019ve all noticed how artificial intelligence has transformed how we interact with technology. One quite interesting application is today\u2019s subject - AI girlfriend apps.\n\nAI girlfriend apps create virtual companions. These companions are designed to meet both your emotional and conversational needs. It doesn\u2019t matter if you're looking for a fun chat or an intimate experience (maybe something even more bespoke), these apps offer a wide range of options to fit different preferences.\n\nBut, with so many choices out there, the process of finding the best AI girlfriend app could seem a bit daunting at first. We can assure you that you shouldn\u2019t worry about a thing, as we\u2019ve already done the research for you.Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of these apps and see which ones are the best (both free and paid).\n\n\u200b\u200bUnlike most sites that offer just a handful of generic options, HeraHaven has an incredible variety. It's basically an AI girlfriend paradise. In only a few seconds, you can generate your virtual AI girlfriend with the exact appearance and personality you want.\n\nPros:\n\nHighly interactive and adaptive\n\nSeamless conversations with emotional intelligence\n\nAffordable premium plans\n\nCons:\n\nSome users might find that free trial features are limited\n\nTry HeraHaven today and see for yourself why they\u2019re the most popular AI girlfriend app. With over 1000 verified online reviews and an aggregate rating of 4.3/5 stars, they have quickly gained a reputation for offering one of the most immersive and interactive virtual girlfriend experiences.\n\nNot only can you chat with your AI girlfriends on HeraHaven, but you can also receive voice notes and spicy pictures from them. Want to try some hentai action too? No problem, HeraHaven has that too. Even if you\u2019re not satisfied by girls, their AI boyfriend solution has you covered.\n\nKupid\n\nThe second one on this list is an app popular for its customization options.\n\nPros:\n\nExtensive customization options\n\nWide selection of AI personalities\n\nSupports text, image, and voice interactions\n\nCons:\n\nLess natural conversation flow\n\nHottalks\n\nOn to the next one. Hottalks is currently a quite popular, but slightly limited option that might not suit everyone\u2019s preferences. But even with its limitations, we still felt like adding Hottalks to our list.\n\nPros:\n\nEngaging and playful interactions\n\nNSFW options available\n\nFree trial offers a good taste of premium features\n\nCons:\n\nLimited customization compared to the majority of other apps\n\nRolemantic\n\nAn app with both a clever name and some clever features. Rolemantic is potentially the best option for those seeking to create roleplaying scenarios. Again, just like with the app above, there are some limitations to using Rolemantic.\n\nPros:\n\nExtensive roleplay options\n\nWide variety of characters\n\nRegular updates to AI scripts\n\nCons:\n\nPremium features are expensive\n\nRomantic AI\n\nAnd, finally, the last one on our list is one of the more popular options for users that are more into enjoying emotional conversations. Compared to the options above, and especially HeraHaven, Romantic AI is maybe the least popular option, but still a good one.\n\nPros:\n\nEmotionally intuitive AI responses\n\nRealistic relationship simulation\n\nOffers both text and voice communication\n\nCons:\n\nExpensive premium plan\n\nLimited free options\n\nConclusion - Which AI Girlfriend app is right for you?\n\nNow that you\u2019re familiar with some of the best AI girlfriend app options out there, let\u2019s summarize everything and give our final thoughts.\n\nChoosing the best AI girlfriend app depends on what you're looking for in a virtual girlfriend. Some people seek more romantic options, others focus on the aesthetic aspect of the app, while some simply want to enjoy different roleplay scenarios.With that being said, one app is the clear winner here - HeraHaven.\n\nIn any case, having that special someone, regardless of whether it\u2019s an actual person or not, is a vital part of everyone\u2019s life.\n\nThis article was written in cooperation with Vilala Limited"

Read preview\n\nWith firms having invested billions of dollars into AI, Wall Street is antsy for a return on its investment.\n\nAs time passes, investors expect concrete monetization cases for the technology across the AI value chain.\n\nUnfortunately, not all AI investments will pay off, according to Moody's. They cite a complex industry with expensive technology and fierce competition.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\n\"Rapid progress and maturing commercial offerings will drive broader adoption over time, but the sheer size of AI investment means that not all investors will achieve positive returns,\" Vincent Gusdorf, head of digital finance and AI analytics at Moody's, wrote in a recent note.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, Moody's believes some companies have positioned themselves for success in the AI revolution. The 13 companies identified below have created tangible competitive advantages by investing in AI infrastructure in the early stages or finding a mission-critical niche within the AI value chain.\n\nInvesting in the AI value chain\n\nIt's still early innings for the AI revolution.\n\nWhile it took several years for earlier technological revolutions like the smartphone or internet to generate products that gained traction with investors, the large language models behind ChatGPT and other AI applications have only been mainstream for less than two years.\n\nThat means definitive AI winners have yet to emerge. But according to Moody's, there are some signs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestors should first understand where they're investing in the AI value chain. According to Moody's, the AI ecosystem is comprised of five layers.\n\nThe first is the hardware, such as semiconductors and chips, that handles AI workloads. Next is the cloud services providers, which store data and train AI models in data centers, followed by the AI foundation models that power ChatGPT. Finally, software infrastructure players assist in integrating AI models into the AI application, or end product that consumers use.\n\nBig Tech companies with the scale and resources to operate data centers and develop AI software infrastructure are particularly well-positioned. These players hold considerable market share across multiple layers of the AI value chain, resulting in higher returns as they use AI in multiple business areas. This gives Big Tech companies an edge as the industry becomes more competitive and AI training costs continue to rise, according to Moody's.\n\nBig Tech certainly isn't the only winner, though. Moody's also identified several companies that create or help enable AI applications in high-growth niche markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the end of the day, companies creating a difficult-to-replicate AI product will succeed in the AI race, Moody's believes.\n\n\"Value will accumulate in segments with the highest barriers to entry,\" Gusdorf wrote.\n\n13 early winners of the AI revolution"

        "date": "6h",
        "source": "Mint",
        "article_content": "Unlike many experts who are still awaiting a killer app in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), Naveen Rao, vice-president of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) at Databricks, says the world already has one -- it\u2019s coding.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of developers actually latch onto this, especially younger developers. LLMs (large language models) have also worked on code (besides text, images, audios, videos, etc.), and we're already seeing design automation happening through coding assistance. It (coding) is a sub-class of a much larger class of uses around true design automation,\" Rao told Mint in a recent video interview from his San Diego office.\n\nRao asserts that with many coding tasks getting automated, the ability to innovate in product design and create unique user experiences will become even more valuable.\n\n\"You can now create apps simply by describing them in English. As a result, the value of translating a design idea into an app has diminished because much of that process is now automated,\" he says.\n\nBeing a developer will mean using AI tools effectively, says Rao, adding that the focus will shift to understanding why certain apps succeed while others don\u2019t.\n\nRao underscores, though, that \u201cit will take 3-5 years to engineer these systems to be reliable and deterministic enough to be able to use them in core engineering.\" The reason is that GenAI still struggles with \u201challucinations\" (incorrect or misleading results) and lacks true reasoning capabilities despite claims to the contrary by some big tech companies.\n\nData is eating the world through AI\n\n\"Current LLMs primarily pattern-match based on probabilities, not reason. Unlike humans or even animals that learn through a cycle of action and feedback, LLMs don\u2019t engage in causal, real-world learning. While advancements, like the step-by-step reasoning introduced by OpenAI, are promising, there\u2019s a long way to go,\" elaborates Rao, who has a degree from Duke University in computer science and a PhD in computational neuroscience from Brown University.\n\nHe is also a serial entrepreneur, having founded AI companies Nervana Systems, which Intel Corp. acquired in 2016 for about $400 million, and MosaicML that was acquired by Databricks last July for $1.3 billion.\n\nWhat keeps Rao up at night is the gap between AI\u2019s potential and its current limitations, particularly in reasoning. According to him, AI models like DeepMind's AlphaZero, which hypothesize and learn through self-play in structured environments, provide a glimpse of what's possible, \u201cbut we\u2019re far from applying that in the real world.\"\n\n\u201cWe need to better understand how to enable models to reason and learn in dynamic environments,\" says Rao.\n\nThis push for reasoning, however, doesn\u2019t necessarily demand greater computing power, according to him. Instead, the shift is towards smaller, high-quality datasets and more targeted tuning, which may not require the massive compute resources associated with training larger models.\n\nRao says this transition from batch offline training to online learning could transform how we approach AI development going forward.\n\nWhy software won\u2019t eat the AI world\n\nRao also insists that software will not eat the AI world, referring to co-founder of US VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, Marc Andreessen's famous 2011 essay titled, \"Why software is eating the world\". In a 30 August thread on 'X' (formerly, Twitter), Rao argued that the \"...fundamental balance of compute and software is different with AI...In light of @nvidia's strong growth and recent earnings, clearly hardware is an essential ingredient to the current wave of AI\u2026\"\n\nRao says he's more \u201cexcited about the ongoing evolution of hardware, which continues to drive efficiency and lower costs.\" He cites the example of the human brain, which operates on just 20 watts of energy, \u201cshowcasing how far we still are from creating AI systems as efficient and advanced.\" He adds that there's significant progress being made in how AI systems interact with hardware, improving latency, cost, and accuracy.\n\nDatabricks, for instance, is exploring \u201cseveral exciting applications of AI and GenAI, particularly in task automation and creative processes,\" according to Rao. One area of focus is automating tasks like answering human resources (HR) queries or searching through company manuals, where \u201cyou can tolerate some error.\"\n\nYou can now create apps simply by describing them in English.\n\nAnother innovative use involves training LLMs to replicate a specific writing style, aiding news organisations by speeding up content creation. Databricks also supports the use of LLMs in scientific research, such as drug discovery, where AI assists in analysing protein interactions and advancing new drug development.\n\nDatabricks has been recognised as a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for data science and machine learning platforms, 'The Forrester Wave: Cloud Data Pipelines, Q4 2023,\" and the 2024 IDC MarketScape for worldwide analytic stream processing.\n\nKey customers using the Databricks' data intelligence platform to streamline data, AI, and analytics processes include Adobe, Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail, Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation, Nasdaq, Air India, Parle, MakeMyTrip, Meesho, Tata Steel, and Shell.\n\nData is the AI oil\n\nDatabricks' DBRX model, for instance, can turn raw data into a fully trained, fine-tuned model. Databricks, says Rao, is now focusing on \"compound AI systems,\" which combine multiple AI models, including open-source and proprietary ones, to create advanced solutions. Using this approach, Databricks helped Factset, a financial software provider, improve its query accuracy and efficiency.\n\nData is an essential ingredient in making AI truly add economic value. So maybe now the mantra is: \u201cData is eating the world through AI\", says Rao.\n\nThat said, many companies struggle to bridge the gap between data readiness and effective AI implementation. A key challenge, says Rao, is to understand the economics of AI, which differs significantly from traditional software models like Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), where many applications can run on a single piece of hardware.\n\nAI models, on the other hand, require dedicated physical infrastructure for each additional user. This, according to Rao, implies that scaling AI would involve costly hardware investments, resulting in lower gross margins (often below 20%) as compared to SaaS. On the development side, rising costs make profitability difficult, particularly as larger companies continue to raise capital and operate at a loss.\n\nIn this context, the key metric for CXOs when integrating AI is \u201cdefining clear success criteria.\" In AI, especially with custom LLMs, this involves creating an evaluation system, much like an exam, to measure the performance of the AI system, says Rao.\n\nHe adds that Databricks offers various tools for optimisation, such as re-ranking and fine-tuning models, which help improve performance. Establishing and refining these metrics is crucial for successful AI deployment.\n\nHe cites the example of Ola's Krutrim, which is one of Databricks\u2019 customers that built its own AI model using the platform, rather than relying on pre-existing models. Other customers like Freshworks and Air India are using custom LLMs and compound AI systems to automate tasks such as chatbots that assist with queries about baggage policies or refunds, according to Rao.\n\nOla\u2019s model is particularly notable, according to him, due to India's linguistic diversity, where multiple languages such as Hindi, English, and regional languages, are mixed in daily communication.\n\nNew skill sets\n\nThat said, Rao agrees that AI will have a deep impact on jobs, especially given the increasing use of copilots and fully autonomous AI agentic systems in enterprises. Autonomous AI agents, or the so-called 'Agentic AI' systems, refer to AI models that can achieve specific goals without any human intervention.\n\nIt's clear we must decide how humans remain integral to the process, says Rao. Databricks is working on this by developing tools that help customers build high-quality AI agents.\n\nThese agents go beyond simple tasks, automating complex processes using customer data to drive value. However, enterprise customers demand transparency, auditability, and security, making this a challenging area, according to Rao.\n\nWe need to better understand how to enable models to reason and learn in dynamic environments\n\nHe adds, \"AI will significantly change jobs, much like other technological advances have in the past. As AI advances, the key skills will include data engineering, system orchestration, product design and AI tool usage.\"\n\nBalancing innovation with responsible AI is also crucial, particularly regarding data privacy, bias, and transparency, Rao acknowledges. Databricks, he adds, excels in governance, with its Unity Catalog ensuring strict security across data and models.\n\nHe elaborates that while bias is application-specific and difficult to automate, Databricks offers filtering tools that allow companies to manage inputs and outputs, ensuring privacy, safety, and content moderation. However, these tools are designed to be flexible and customizable to suit various customer needs.\n\nDo we need a Chief AI Officer?\n\nGiven the complexity of the field, do enterprises need a Chief AI Officer? Especially, given that many large organisations already have senior executive roles like that of a chief information officer (CIO), chief technology officer (CTO), chief data officer, chief digital officer, and even a chief marketing officer (CMO), who oversee a lot of AI functions.\n\nAlso Read: TCS boss Krithivasan is unafraid of GenAI but unwilling to say the worst is past\n\nRao agrees, pointing out that companies reacted to the AI boom by rushing to integrate AI and hiring for this role without clear boundaries, leading to conflicts over budgets and responsibilities. According to him, a more practical solution may be combining data and AI into a Chief Data and AI Officer role, separating these duties from the broader productivity-focused role of a CIO.\n\nLast, but not the least, Rao says that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is often misinterpreted. Some define it by how much human productivity it can replace, but true AGI would need to interact with the world, learn from its actions, and adapt\u2014something far beyond the current technology, he explains. He suggests that while AGI remains a distant goal, companies should focus on how AI can improve business processes and customer experiences today."

I was also present when this particular participant suddenly spoke in English and introduced himself as \u2018Mr Gopal\u2019 and told us \u2018his\u2019 story,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough the truth of this story and the existence of \u2018Mr Gopal\u2019 cannot be verified, the old uncompleted mansion\u2019s environment alone is enough to send shivers down the spine of faint-hearted visitors.\n\nThe construction of Kellie\u2019s Castle, also known as Kellas House, started in 1915, initiated by its owner (William Kellie Smith), a civil engineer from Scotland who came to Malaya to venture into the rubber planting and tin-mining industries.\n\nHowever, Smith died of pneumonia in 1926. At that time, the construction of the mansion had only reached 70 percent completion.\n\nFollowing his demise, the construction work was suspended and the property was eventually sold to a British company Harrisons and Crosfield. It was subsequently abandoned and years later, it became a historical site.\n\nKellie\u2019s Castle manager Hakim Muhaimin shows the laundry room where \u2018Mr Gopal\u2019 once worked in. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nDark tourism material\n\nThe spooky atmosphere of Kellie\u2019s Castle \u2013 sprawled over a 2.8-hectare (seven-acre) site \u2013 combined with the eerie sightings and paranormal encounters reported by visitors, make it an ideal destination for dark tourism, a tourism subsector that is gaining increasing attention globally and is expected to continue growing over the next 10 years.\n\nAccording to projections by Future Market Insights, the global dark tourism market is expected to be valued at US$31.89 billion (RM148.68 billion) by the end of this year.\n\nIt also forecasts the market will swell to US$40.82 billion (RM190.32 billion) by 2034. Zamari, who is also Perak Bumiputera Tourism Operators Association president, recognises Kellie\u2019s Castle\u2019s potential for dark tourism-themed activities, stressing the subsector has the potential to invigorate the nation\u2019s tourism industry.\n\nHe said dark tourism is a unique attraction for tourists, adding that although it has already been introduced in this country, it has however not been widely developed by the tourism industry due to certain constraints involving society and the beliefs of local communities.\n\n\u201cWhen I took over the management of Kellie\u2019s Castle in 2013, we thought about what actions or steps could be taken to elevate this location as a tourist attraction because at first glance, there was nothing much there except an old building.\n\n\u201cI then considered what strengths Kellie\u2019s Castle had that could be marketed for tourism purposes. If I focused on its history, not many people would be interested. In terms of the building itself, it mostly appeals to photography and architecture enthusiasts. Ultimately, the idea of dark tourism emerged,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he added, promoting a certain building or place as a dark tourism site is not easy. He believed that in order to offer an authentic paranormal experience at a dark tourism site, supernatural entities must truly exist and originate from the location concerned, not summoned or artificially created.\n\nNight tours\n\nHence, to market Kellie\u2019s Castle as a dark tourism destination, the management had to confirm the \u201cexistence\u201d of paranormal elements.\n\nWith this in mind, Zamari collaborated with a local media outlet in 2015 and \u201cwe successfully detected and documented the presence of an entity (inside Kellie\u2019s Castle), supported by a video recording\u201d.\n\nFollowing this, the management introduced night-time tours of the property on Fridays and Saturdays in the month of October every year.\n\n\u201cWhat we do during the tour (from 8 pm to 11.30 pm) is bring visitors in groups of eight to 16 and guide them through the castle while providing some explanations.\n\n\u201cThen, we leave two people at each specific location such as the wine cellar, laundry room, bedrooms and other areas without flashlights for 10 to 15 minutes,\u201d he said, adding some of the participants reported being \u201cdisturbed\u2019 by mysterious touches, embraces, whispers in their ears and sudden gusts of wind.\n\nZamari stressed he is not in the business of \u201cselling ghosts\u201d but rather offering visitors a unique experience of visiting a site associated with paranormal activity.\n\nHe added that efforts to market Kellie\u2019s Castle as a dark tourism product are being made to further boost the number of visitors to the mansion.\n\nWith its easy accessibility, the Kellie\u2019s Castle ruins in Perak is a popular haunt for thrill seekers and those looking for charming Instagrammable background to their OOTD. \u2014 Bernama pic\n\nTourist attraction\n\nZamari, meanwhile, said the tales of paranormal activities at Kellie\u2019s Castle have even impressed the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), which also acknowledged the building\u2019s easy accessibility and the thrilling yet safe ghost-hunting tours offered by its management.\n\nHe said in 2020, PATA \u2013 which has its headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand \u2013 invited them to share their dark tourism experience involving Kellie\u2019s Castle through a virtual meeting attended by 400 delegates.\n\n\u201cAll of them were very excited to hear our stories and experiences in managing dark tourism. They asked many questions and expressed a strong interest in participating in such dark tourism explorations themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nTourism Malaysia has listed Kellie\u2019s Castle as one of the country\u2019s top two horror tourism destinations, alongside the Penang War Museum.\n\nKellie\u2019s Castle manager Hakim Muhaimin said the property is categorised as one of the five most haunted locations in Malaysia by international paranormal researchers and United States-based tourism portals.\n\nHe also said the night tours of the mansion were discontinued during and following the COVID-19 pandemic and plans are afoot to reintroduce them soon.\n\n\u201cBut this time, we plan to offer two types of dark tourism activities \u2013 night tours and sleeping in the castle.\n\n\u201cFor the sleepover in the castle, we will provide the participants with sleeping bags and other equipment,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said dark tourism involving Kellie\u2019s Castle has the potential to succeed due to the high demand for it particularly the \u2018Sleeping in the Castle\u2019 activity for which \u201cwe have already received inquiries from Singaporeans\u201d.\n\nHe also hoped the authorities would increase the number of dark tourism locations in the country to support the growth of the tourism industry and suggested that this subsector be widely promoted during Visit Malaysia Year 2025.\n\nAccording to the 2023 Tourism Malaysia Report, the country earned over RM71.3 billion from the arrival of 20.14 million tourists last year, while Vietnam\u2019s media organisation Vnexpress International ranked Malaysia as the most-visited country in Southeast Asia in 2023. \u2014 Bernama"

        "article_content": "An estimated 50 night parrots (Pezoporus occidentalis) survive in a newly discovered colony in a remote area of Western Australia, more than doubling population estimates for colonies of a bird thought extinct for decades. Although the discovery greatly increases the chance of saving the parrot with one of the planet\u2019s most unusual avian lifestyles (despite nocturnal living, it seems they don't actually have great night vision), it remains critically endangered, and the finders are calling for more help to save it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA few years ago it had been so long since the Ngururrpa people had seen or heard a night parrot that its place in their culture had almost been forgotten. Ngururrpa authors on a paper reporting its rediscovery within the Ngururrpa Indigenous Protected Area write that \u201cWe thought they were only living in one area, on our neighbour\u2019s country.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Ngururrpa rangers and university scientists placed acoustic recorders known as songmeters at 31 sites across a vast area of the eastern Pilbara, one of the most remote and sparsely inhabited areas on Earth. Seventeen of these sites recorded the parrot\u2019s night-time call. By searching at the most promising sites, rangers and scientists came across an old nest and some feathers, as well as sometimes hearing the bird calls themselves and photographing one with a camera trap.\n\nA bird that only comes out at night in one of the least populated place on Earth is hard to photograph, but this camera trap captured one. Image Supplied: Dr Rachel Paltridge\n\n\n\nThe recordings revived stories about how the parrot\u2019s eerie call was once used by Ngururrpa parents to discourage children from straying too far from campfires, telling them it was the sound of evil spirits. The tale is one example of how collaboration between scientists and Ngururrpa rangers could help save both the local ecology and the Ngururrpa\u2019s threatened cultural heritage.\n\nA hit rate of more than half may make it seem the night parrot is thriving, but the sites were carefully chosen. The team looked for places with types of spinifex (an Australian grass), similar to those where night parrots have been found in Queensland, and where cats appear to be rare. That combination appears to be essential for night parrots, and it accounts for only a small portion of their former range.\n\nAuthors Angus Reid, Clifford Sunfly, Rachel Paltridge and Nick Leseberg with a songmeter that recorded the night parrot's call. Image Supplied: Dr Rachel Paltridge\n\n\n\nDr Rachel Paltridge of the Indigenous Desert Alliance told IFLScience: \u201cWe\u2019ve never flushed [a parrot] out when walking past a nesting site.\u201d In years of study the only time scientists or rangers saw parrots was on the second last trip when one \u201cFlew into camp and landed in front of rangers.\u201d Although Paltridge says they \u201cgot a good look,\u201d even a generation used to Instagramming everything didn\u2019t reach for their cameras in time to photograph the bird.\n\nThe Parrot Of The Night\n\nWhen owls evolved to hunt in darkness they developed a wide array of specialist features, such as exceptional eyesight and noise-cancelling wings. Parrots have no such features, and are usually very much creatures of daylight. However, in the arid Australian center, where daytime temperatures above 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F) are the norm the heat is a major impediment. Night parrots opted to keep cool, a different reason from the world\u2019s only other nocturnal parrot, the equally endangered but far more famous Kakapo. One study of their eyes indicates relatively small changes compared to other parrots.\n\nWith sightings so sparse Paltridge told IFLScience, \u201cThere\u2019s very little detail on their biology.\u201d Nevertheless, one Queensland parrot died from flying into a fence. Paltridge said that in the flat and treeless landscape the parrots inhabit, being able to see where you are flying might not be that important, or wasn\u2019t until humans put obstacles in the parrots' way.\n\nWhatever changes the parrots made to be active at night worked for a long time; when Europeans discovered the night parrot in the 19th century, their habitat covered a vast area of Australia. Then came the cats. By 1979, no night parrot had been sighted for 67 years, and the bird was suspected to be extinct. After several reports in 1979-80, confirmation of the bird\u2019s survival came in 1990, ironically from the discovery of a recently dead specimen. The first live population was found in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parrot\u2019s rediscovery has been one of the great stories of endangered species survival, but confirmed sightings remain rare. With well over a thousand kilometers separating one rediscovery site in western Queensland, and another in Western Australia phrases like \u201cfew and far apart\u201d could hardly be more accurate.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe distance between the known parrot locations provides a little insurance against local threats, but also means both populations are under extreme danger of inbreeding. The new discovery lies between the previous sites, but is still much too far from the Queensland habitat for the ground-dwelling parrots, thought to fly no more than 30 kilometers (19 miles) for water or to seek a mate.\n\nThreats And Hopes\n\nThe authors conclude dingoes are key to the night parrots\u2019 survival. There is no evidence dingoes eat the parrots, but they certainly eat cats, thus acting as the parrots\u2019 protector. Their role in keeping down fox populations may help as well. Maintaining dingo populations appears to be one crucial step for night parrot survival.\n\nThe newly discovered colony faces a threat the better-studied Queensland one does not, however, because its lands are much more fire-prone. Rangers conduct small burns to lower fuel loads and prevent vast conflagrations that could wipe out a colony in one go. The finding team recommends these continue, but with timing and locations adjusted for the bird\u2019s safety.\n\nThe paper also includes requests from the Ngururrpa rangers for more equipment to improve knowledge of where the parrots are. Eventually, they hope to capture and tag some, revealing their movements and particularly where they go for water during the long dry season. This, Paltridge told IFLScience, would allow for more targeted predator controls.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBesides fire and introduced predators, the parrots may be threatened by the disruption of feral camels. The consequences of global heating on the parrots are unknown, but in one of the hottest bird habitats on Earth, they\u2019re unlikely to be good.\n\nThe study announcing the colony is published in Wildlife Research."

They measured variations in galaxy brightness\u2014indicators of black hole presence\u2014resulting in the identification of more black holes than previous methods had revealed. This is a new image of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. (Photo: Nasa)\n\nThe findings indicate that some black holes likely formed from the collapse of massive, pristine stars during the first billion years after the Big Bang. These early stars were unique, as later generations became enriched with elements from previous stellar explosions.\n\nOther potential formation scenarios include collapsing gas clouds and mergers of stars within massive clusters. Additionally, primordial black holes may have formed through speculative mechanisms in the universe's infancy.\n\nMatthew Hayes, lead author and astronomer at Stockholm University, emphasized that understanding how early black holes formed is essential for piecing together the puzzle of galaxy evolution.\n\nWith this new data, researchers can refine models of how galaxies and their central black holes evolve together.\n\nIn tandem with these findings, astronomers are using the James Webb Space Telescope to further explore galactic black holes formed soon after the Big Bang, aiming to uncover their masses and locations in the early universe.\n\nThis ongoing research is pivotal for unraveling the mysteries surrounding black hole formation and their influence on galaxy development.\n\nPublished By: Sibu Kumar Tripathi Published On: Sep 23, 2024"

With Ive\u2019s firm LoveFrom leading the design, the profile describes the goal as building \u201ca product that uses A.I. to create a computing experience that is less socially disruptive than the iPhone.\u201d\n\nIndustrial designer Marc Newson, who\u2019s working with Ive, said the product specifics and release timing haven\u2019t been decided. Despite that vagueness, the startup is fundraising, with Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Emerson Collective and Ive himself contributing. It sounds like the company is aiming to raise up to $1 billion by the end of the year."
