A strange oval-shaped ship gliding away into the sunset like the cowboy at the end of a western.\n\n\"We could only stare, frozen and slack-jawed as it disappeared.\n\n\"I swear we saw something unexplainable in the sky that night.\"\n\nIn 1985 the rest stop was transformed by Australian sailor and UFO fanatic Lew Farkas who wanted to do more with the area's alien history.\n\nFarkas, who owned Wycliffe for 25 years before retiring spoke to Vice about his out-of-this-world creation, where he explained that he arrived at the site in 1985 to conduct a \"five-year experiment.\"\n\nMap reveals UK's five UFO hotspots as expert reveals wildest alien encounters - how does your town fare?\n\nThe entrepreneur hoped to make Wycliffe a true tourist destination and a mecca for UFO lovers.\n\nIn the 1860s, Wycliffe Well was a popular rest stop for the Overland Telegraph Line and later provided soldiers in the Second World War a place to rest and refuel.\n\nDuring this time, people reported seeing a lot of unusual activity in the sky, with soldiers making note of almost constant UFO sightings.\n\nWhen the war was over, people continued to visit the area and report unusual activity which eventually saw Farkas invest over AUS 4 million (\u00a31.9 million) into the site before he retired in 2010.\n\nIt started with a mural based on a UFO sighting in the area that saw tourists come to take pictures as a \"memento\" of the spot, he told Vice.\n\n\"We started converting everything\u2014every wall, every bit of space in the area\u2014to do with space, to do with aliens, to do with UFOs. It got famous very quickly and it put Wycliffe Well on the world map.\"\n\nFarkas installed a gas station, a bar, lodging, a store, a camping ground and even a fishing lake to get alien hunters and others visiting the site.\n\nHe constructed a Galaxy Auditorium which was a 300-seat restaurant with a stage for shows, got a tourist train that went around a Barramundi-filled lake, and conducted at-night alien and UFO tours.\n\nFor those desperate to catch a glimpse of the extraterrestrial, he installed a viewing platform called Mount Wycliffe where people could stand to get a better view of UFOs.\n\n\"Every aspect of Wycliffe Well had to become alien-orientated or space-orientated,\" he told ABC.\n\nUNEXPLAINABLE\n\nFrom the minute he arrived at the site, Farkas knew there was something special about it.\n\nTalking to Vice he recalled that \"there were lights flashing around the sky doing crazy manoeuvres that you just couldn't explain.\"\n\nFarkas said that during his ownership of the site, there were hundreds of reported sightings which had varying impacts on customers.\n\n8 The roadhouse is located 380 kilometres north of Alice Springs on the Stuart Highway Credit: Getty\n\n8 Murals are still visible at the run-down and forgotten site Credit: Getty\n\n8 Picture taken in 2007 showing Wycliffe Well and the Stuart Highway Credit: AFP\n\n\"On a lot of occasions people were getting chased down the highway by lights,\" he explained.\n\n\"They would pull up and be panicking so much that they would say, 'Quick give us a room, we can\u2019t stay out there.'\n\n\"So that was good for business\u2026 It chased people away at times, but it brought customers in too.\"\n\nSome of the tales were so terrifying that guests at Wycliffe would want to \"release their burdens\" which saw Farkas install diaries at the counter to let visitors recount their alien experiences.\n\nFarkas recalled that some guests claimed they saw aliens in the desert.\n\nAnthony Vanderzalm who took over the site from Farkas in 2010 has said that groups of visitors have claimed to have been lured outside to witness odd activity which left him stunned.\n\nHe told Journal News: \"I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I arrived. My mind was boggling.\n\n\"There\u2019s been four of five occasions when all the people out of the restaurant have gone out and observed something very unusual.\n\n\"It\u2019s never the same twice. All types of different lights, changing direction, and colourful.\"\n\nIf you drive to Wycliffe Well today, you will be met with a sign reading \"Caution proceed with care UFO landing site ahead.\"\n\nBut, it is then abundantly clear that the rest stop has been abandoned though perhaps not by all forms of life.\n\nNow, it has decapitated alien statues, an abandoned train, and a crumbling galaxy theatre.\n\nVanderszalm ended up selling the business to a petrol company which has seen the site fall to the hands of vandals.\n\nNow, the abandoned site looks like a bizarre, derelict theme park with faded murals, broken flying saucers and masses of forgotten alien memorabilia.\n\nDevastating flooding in 2022 forced the business to move out and no one has been back since other than those who wish to destroy what is left.\n\n8 People who have stayed at the campsite next to the roadhouse have reported bizarre sightings Credit: Getty\n\n8 Groups of visitors have reportedly been lured outside at the same time to watch unexplainable activity Credit: Alamy"

The user said their father, who had significant military experience, was unable to explain what was behind the light.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cMy dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before\u2026\n\nImage: Reddit) Reddit)\n\n\u201cJust after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,\u201d the user said according to the Mail Online.\n\n\u201cMy friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone\u2026 Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.\"\n\nOnlookers were confused by the orb, which appeared to be similar to other objects spotted in the US recently. Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video on December 27 and said they saw \u201cfour strange orbs in formation in what is supposed to be a no-fly zone\u201d in Brookville Blvd, Queens, New York.\n\nImage: Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701) Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701)\n\nIn December, while media in the US focused on reports of puzzling unidentified aircraft in New Jersey, it appears some believe we may have our own mysterious visitors. There were three official reports of UFO sightings in Northern Ireland in 2024.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence previously recorded UFO sightings, but closed its UFO desk in 2009 after concluding that in more than 50 years, no received report had ever disclosed any evidence of a potential threat.\n\nNick Pope, who previously investigated UFO reports for the MoD, said the figures sound \u201cstaggeringly low\u201d, and said the MoD used to receive \u201cseveral hundred sightings each year\u201d before 2009.\n\nHe said he believes many won\u2019t come forward with sightings because they fear they will not be believed. \u201cNone of the sightings sound particularly spectacular, and the one mentioning red and green flashing lights and a vapour trail is clearly an aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe annotation on the FOI response stating \u2018noted for information by police\u2019 is a polite way of saying the cops didn\u2019t take any further action, and that\u2019s quite understandable, because it really isn\u2019t their job. That doubtless explains the low numbers, because anyone seeing a UFO will realize this isn\u2019t really a matter for the police.\""

            "article_content": "You\u2019ve no doubt noticed artificial intelligence finding its way into every app, service, and hardware device. It\u2019s now unusual to see a tech product launch where AI isn\u2019t the main talking point. Meta is one of the companies pushing AI the hardest, with its own set of AI models, and a selection of AI bots and tools inside its own apps. (Experts and critics also say Meta may be taking their AI too far, which Meta responded to by removing multiple AI profile accounts.)\n\nIf you\u2019ve used Facebook, WhatsApp, or Instagram recently, then you may have spotted a new Meta AI bot, ready and waiting to be of assistance. Here\u2019s how you can make use of it\u2014and what your options are in terms of security and privacy.\n\nHow to find Meta AI\n\nYou\u2019ll find Meta AI front and center in Meta\u2019s apps: In the Facebook Messenger app, for example, tap Chats and you\u2019ll see a Meta AI input box right at the top, above your real life friends and family members. Tap inside that box, and you can start chatting about whatever topic you like. You can also tap Meta AI on the tab bar at the bottom.\n\nIt\u2019s the same in the WhatsApp app (you\u2019ll see the Meta AI logo on the Chats tab), and in the Instagram app (tap the message button, in the top right corner of the home tab, and Meta AI is at the top). The Meta AI logo is a glowing blue and purple circle, and it\u2019s hard to miss as you use the apps.\n\nMeta AI is prominently displayed in your chats. Screenshot: Meta\n\nThere\u2019s another way to get Meta AI up, inside one-to-one or group chats with real people: Tag @MetaAI in your conversation, type out a prompt, and you\u2019ll get the same response as you would if you were chatting to the AI bot directly\u2014except, of course, the other chat participants will be able to see the message and response.\n\nThe AI bot chats all use the same underlying model (called Llama), but your chats aren\u2019t synced between the three apps. Unfortunately for AI skeptics, there\u2019s no way to hide or turn off Meta AI: You just have to ignore it if you don\u2019t want to use it. However, you can delete, mute, and archive Meta AI chats just like any other conversation\u2014just long press on the AI chat in the main conversation list.\n\nHow to use Meta AI\n\nIf you\u2019ve used an AI chatbot like Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT, then you\u2019ll be familiar with the way these tools work: You can ask Meta AI to look up facts from the web, write poetry, or suggest ideas for something. You can get recommendations for podcasts, inspiration for a birthday party, or suggestions about how to fix a faucet leak.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI for advice and instruction on just about any topic\u2014though as usual with generative AI, be careful of putting too much trust in the answers. These AI bots are built to imagine new text, and that can lead to hallucinations. Sometimes Meta AI will reference the web (when looking up facts, for example)\u2014and when this happens you\u2019ll see web links within the response. Tap on these links to check the facts.\n\nYou can ask Meta AI questions about just about anything. Screenshot: Meta\n\nImage generation is included here: Just ask Meta AI to create or draw an image of whatever you like. It could be a cat sat on a wall, a cabin in the woods, or a person exploring the surface of Mars. The more detail you can add, the more closely the result is going to match your original vision\u2014and you can specify the style of the image too, whether it\u2019s a photo, a painting, or something else.\n\nThere are some interesting image-related tricks you can try: For example, you can use it to create a new profile picture for yourself. Two suggestions from Meta are \u201cimagine me as royalty\u201d or \u201cimagine me in a surrealist painting\u201d, so you can see what\u2019s possible. You\u2019re also able to edit an AI-generated image by tapping and holding on it, then typing in your additional prompt.\n\nMeta AI can generate images for you as well. Screenshot: Meta\n\nMeta itself splits what you can do into three main sections: learn (\u201csummarize the history of the Universe\u201d), create (\u201cimagine dogs playing chess\u201d), and connect (\u201cplan a game night with friends\u201d). That gives you some idea of what\u2019s possible, and you can now interact with Meta AI with your voice if you want\u2014just tap the sound button to the right of the input box.\n\nOne of the features recently added to Meta AI is the ability to use photos in your chats\u2014either picked from your phone\u2019s gallery or taken through the camera. You can identify objects and landmarks, create AI images based on existing photos, and more: Try snapping a picture of a cake and asking how to make it, for example."

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nWinter always throws my fitness habits off track. The weather gets colder, the holiday treats show up, and the drive to stick to my usual workout routine falls off a cliff. The winter months are hard for the home-gym-goer, with no one but yourself to offer encouragement and accountability. And while I do okay at keeping myself on track for most of the year, once the snow hits the ground, I need to call in reinforcements.\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve used this time to shake things up\u2014trying new workout apps or finding fresh ways to inject novelty into my regimen. One app I experimented with is Zombies, Run!, which immerses users in a post-apocalyptic narrative where they run from zombies rather than just calories. With its engaging writing, voice acting, and sound design, it offers a unique running experience and even features a Marvel superhero expansion.\n\nBut here's the thing: Zombies never did much for me. And I also want to be able to customize my workouts in pretty specific ways, adapting to the equipment I have, the goals I'm pursuing, and the narratives I'm interested in. What if I want to add in some dumbbell exercises, or some jump rope? What if I need to focus on my core as much as my arms or work around an injury?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a long time, I just assumed that level of customization was too much for any app to deliver. The knowledge of a professional trainer, the creativity of a writer weaving workouts into stories, and the immersive voice acting seemed unattainable for my niche Monday workout.\n\nTo some extent, I was right. I can't replicate the movement tracking, the professional sound design, or the slick app to run it all. But I can get a heck of a lot closer than I ever imagined by using the latest AI tools.\n\nWith a combination of AI-powered research, generative writing, and AI narration, I'm creating customized workouts that double as thrilling adventures, set in any narrative I can imagine! Let me show you how I'm using AI to put myself in the story and get fitter while I do.\n\nThe Tools: Perplexity, ChatGPT and ElevenLabs Reader\n\nTo create these AI-powered workouts, I use three different tools. They're all free, though jumping between them takes a bit of effort. Why this combination? Because I wanted a workout that was accurate, engaging, and completely personalized. These tools make that possible.\n\nFor putting my workout together, I'm using , a search-focused tool that's sort of like a mashup of Google search and ChatGPT, where it summarizes real-world search results to offer informed answers to your questions. It's not perfect, but I find that it's a better tool for getting fact-based answers with fewer hallucinations than ChatGPT. There are several different out there, but Perplexity has found its way to the top of my preferred tool list.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI'm also using ChatGPT to take that workout plan and turn it into an immersive narrative. The brainstorming and creative writing uses of ChatGPT make it a great fit for this, turning a simple 8-exercise routine into an extensive step-by-step guide, and then weaving those exercises into a customized story.\n\nFinally, I'm using to give voice to my new workout adventures. ElevenLabs specializes in AI text-to-speech, using AI voices to provide computer-generated narration that sounds surprisingly lifelike, with natural cadence and inflection. And the Reader app (available for and ) lets me do that for free on my phone, making it perfect for this workout project.\n\nSpeaking of tools, there's one more essential item for this AI workout adventure: a good old-fashioned note-taking document. Why? Because juggling information between different AI tools can get messy. A central document lets you easily copy, paste, edit, and refine your workout plan and story without losing track of anything.\n\nThis will be helpful as you pull together research, draft workout guides and stories, and prepare the final text for audio narration. For this project I actually recommend using two documents: One for the workout and instructions and another for drafting the final narrative text.\n\nThe Walkthrough: From Research to Audio Workout\n\nOpen your notes document and jot down any specific thoughts you have before planning anything. Getting your own thoughts clear about your exercise goals, your equipment and resources, and any unique needs or concerns that you have will help you know what you need to discuss before you do any research at all. When in doubt, start with notes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd my most important advice about doing bigger projects with AI: Tackle things in bite-sized pieces. That means generating outlines before you ask it to write full stories, and do your brainstorming before you're in the thick of a long narrative script. LLM tools are great at small, discrete tasks (even complex ones!), but throwing multi-step projects at them can lead to frustrating results due to small miscommunications or problems you don't catch when trying to focus on the bigger picture.\n\n1. Research and Design Your Workout With Perplexity\n\nWhen putting together a workout routine, I worry a lot about having accurate information. So, while there are plenty of guides out there for using ChatGPT to build a custom workout plan, I actually prefer to use a different tool: . Because Perplexity combines LLM capabilities with online search, it pulls from high-quality information sources, and then answers the question, resulting in higher-quality information, drastically fewer hallucinations, and a better overall result.\n\nPerplexity's basic user interface is also very easy to use: Ask a question, and you'll get a nuanced answer, complete with cited sources. But many people don't realize that you can also enter more information in each prompt, letting you specify things like what exercise equipment you have, what parts of the body you want to target, and any additional information, like injuries or conditions that might require you to adjust your workout plans.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can also ask for information in different formats, and when dealing with lists and detail-rich data, I often ask for the response in table format. In this case, I can ask for a list of recommended exercises, but also add columns for the muscle groups worked, the equipment used, and more.\n\nFinally, you don't need to settle for whatever the first answer says. You can engage Perplexity in a back-and-forth conversation, tweaking and refining answers to your needs, or expanding on things if you need more information. A little back and forth goes a long way when the AI can also pull in research materials, making it really easy to zero in on exactly what you need. I spent some time tweaking things to my liking, but the end result is a simple but effective workout, tailored to my equipment and needs.\n\nOnce I'm happy with the workout plan, I copy it into my notes for future reference. There's no need to reinvent that wheel once it's done. And as I go from one tool to another, I can pull that info from my notes and feed it to whatever other tool I'm using.\n\nI will also ask for instructions on how to perform each exercise properly. This information is especially helpful for moves I might not be familiar with, but even the moves you know well should get some attention paid to correct form, and the information will come in handy shortly. This is also another instance where Perplexity's search-based AI is best, since you don't want a hallucination about exercise technique leading to an easily avoidable injury down the line.\n\nI paste the workout, the individual exercises, and the exercise-specific instructions into a document and save them for use in our next step, which uses ChatGPT.\n\n2. Script Your Guided Routine With ChatGPT\n\nNext, I'll switch to , since I'm more comfortable using it to generate content in different styles. For this, I'll attack the workout piece by piece, focusing on one exercise at a time. The first exercise will get the most time and attention, because it will be where I define what I want in terms of tone and format.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHere's the prompt I used, with information pasted in about each specific exercise:\n\nAfter which I simply pasted in the relevant workout instructions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt took some revising and refining to get the cadence right for an exercise that's done fairly quickly, but it wasn't hard to make those tweaks.\n\nMaking corrections to either the first or second part of the text also makes it easier to iteratively adjust the phrasing and flow to something you think will work during your workout.\n\nHere's the script section I got after just a few tweaks:\n\nNow, all that you need to do is paste in the information about the next exercise, and ask ChatGPT to follow the same format. Doing all of this in the same conversation makes it very simple to get consistent formatting across each exercise.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPaste these sections together into a document, and you'll quickly have your workout written out, with guidance and counted reps. If a guided workout is all you wanted, you can skip step 3 and jump right to step 4, where we'll use AI to narrate your workout. But don't skip it, because this is the fun part.\n\n3. Craft Your Immersive Experience With ChatGPT\n\nSo far we've researched a workout and generated a script to walk you through your routine. That's cool, but it's pretty basic in terms of generative AI. Here's where things get a little more interesting.\n\nInstead of doing a standard workout, with nothing but boring instructions and monotonous reps, I wanted my workout to be a little more fun. That's where the fiction-writing capability of ChatGPT really shines. With your workout already mapped out, with instructions and rep counts, it's simply a matter of adapting that information to fit into a larger narrative.\n\nTo do this, I used a two-step prompt, first to prime the concept of the exercise-within-a-story idea, and then followed up with the rough idea, asking ChatGPT to outline a story for the setting I imagined, which in this case is a secret agent mission to sneak in and out of an enemy compound.\n\nThe second prompt is story-specific, and can be adjusted to whatever setting or adventure you want. And ChatGPT, once it understands what you're asking for, will easily generate that story outline as many times as you want, with as many variations as you want. And changing a detail here or there is pretty simple in the outline stage, when the content is short and easy to digest.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWith a rough outline in hand, I have the foundation for a story-driven workout that can be adapted to whatever exercises I want to do. Using a mix of my own creativity and ChatGPT, it wasn't hard to come up with in-story actions that matched each exercise. My planks became the action to crawl under some barbed wire. My offset overhead march with dumbbells? Carrying surveillance equipment. In short order, I had transformed my exercise list into a series of actions that fit within the frame an espionage mission.\n\nSince I already have a basic workout script written, all I need to do now is ask it to adapt each set of instructions into the story outline and in-story explanations that we've already discussed.\n\nGiving ChatGPT the scenario, the exercise descriptions, and the explanation of how each movement would fit into the story made it easy for ChatGPT to craft a story around this sequence of moves. But if you aren't feeling like doing the work of coming up with these specifics, you can always ask ChatGPT to do so \u2013 it's great at brainstorming!\n\nFinally, for an added bit of polish, I added the idea that all of this was being said to me through an earpiece, instructions from a handler that was observing me actions through satellite footage and hacked surveillance cameras. With their guidance and encouragement, I made my way through the mission.\n\nIs it a little goofy? Yeah, but so is exercise. If I'm going to crank through 30 minutes of repetitive motions, I much prefer doing it this way. And there's so many different stories I could insert myself into!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMaybe spies and secret missions aren't your thing. But you could put yourself into pretty much any scenario you can imagine. An astronaut on Mars. A pirate on a ship at sea. A vampire hunter in a monster-infested city. A superhero in battle. A certain Italian plumber that stomps on turtles while saving a princess. If there's a game or movie or other scenario you can imagine, ChatGPT can write it, or even help you brainstorm new settings and adventures you've never seen elsewhere.\n\nAnd since it's building these stories and actions around the workout you already put together, the story can change, but the exercise is still tailored to your workout goals and equipment requirements.\n\nAs you finalize your story workout, just copy and paste into a new document, until you're happy with the overall narrative. Once you're done, save the document as a PDF on your phone.\n\n4. Generate Your AI Workout Audio With ElevenLabs Reader\n\nWe've got one more ingredient needed to take this imaginative exercise routine into the gym with you, and that's audio. Now, I can only speak for myself here, but I don't have the budget to hire voice actors to read stories and workout instructions to me. But AI has a solution to that problem too!\n\nWith an app called Reader by ElevenLabs, we can get audio narration of whatever text we give it, including our guided workouts and crazy ChatGPT-written stories. When using the phone app, you can generate audio for as much text as you want, all for free. (If you opt for a premium membership, you can even customize voices, use multiple voices, and record and save audio.)\n\nTo feed your document to ElevenLabs Reader, you'll need to save the document to your phone. The app supports multiple file formats, but I've had the most success with PDF.\n\nHit the big plus button at the bottom of the main screen, then select \"Import File\" and select the saved document from your Google Drive or your phone's file storage. Once it's uploaded, you'll be able to find the document in the Reader app library.\n\nSelect the voice you want from the app's library of voices (which has options for gender, accent, and general tone), and you're off to the races. Or the recon mission. Or the dragon's lair. Or wherever your immersive audio workout takes you.\n\nNow that all the work is done, you can listen to that same workout anytime you want. And since it's all saved into a document you can edit, you can easily make changes to adjust the flow and pacing of instructions, fix irritating details in the story, or rewrite it in a new story entirely.\n\nWho knew that AI could transform my home gym into a thrilling spy adventure? But this experiment revealed that with a little creativity, today's AI tools can not only help you make an effective workout, they can turn it into an immersive, game-like experience that can be endlessly customized.\n\nCombine AI Tools and Create Amazing Things\n\nAny one of the tools I talked about above opens up all sorts of clever uses. Perplexity, for example, is an incredible tool for research and learning, with applications ranging from homework and study to professional fact-finding and upskilling. The combination of search and an LLM chat interface is surprisingly powerful, and I barely scratched the surface of what it can do. Everything I did in this story uses the free version \u2013 a premium membership unlocks all sorts of advanced capabilities.\n\nChatGPT's text generation is more well known at this point, but OpenAI is adding new functions and capabilities all the time. As of this writing, the company just announced that Canvas, a drafting tool for writing and programming, is now available to all users, including free accounts. With multimodal capabilities that include image generation, machine vision, and conversational voice interactions, ChatGPT is a powerful collection of tools on its own, and growing more powerful at a rapid clip.\n\nFinally, it's worth remembering that AI is a lot more than just text and image generation. ElevenLabs has created some really sophisticated AI narration tools, giving people access to quality spoken language that used to require voice actors and an expensive recording setup. That means that regular users can use it for everything from reading articles and papers, while creators can use the same voices to bring life to game characters, narrate videos and presentations, and more. One new feature in the Reader app lets you generate podcast-style discussions of the text you upload, similar to Google's NotebookLM.\n\nPerplexity, ChatGPT, and ElevenLabs each have unique strengths, but together they can do even more. And all of this was done using the free versions of these apps. No paid premium accounts, no expensive features.\n\nThis same combination of tools could be used for all sorts of applications beyond creative fitness routines.\n\nPersonalized bedtime stories for kids\n\nEngaging study materials and customized review\n\nPersonalized news briefings\n\nCustomized guided meditations\n\nFrom fitness to parenting, academics to personal development, there are myriad uses for AI when you start combining one tool with another.\n\nHow do you use AI to make your life easier?

            "article_content": "It has come to my attention that world leaders like JD Vance and Steve Bannon are avid and enthusiastic readers of a computer engineer named Curtis Yarvin. He has written mostly about politics but also about technology and current affairs.\n\nWhat might be most alarming to some that our future vice president is taking Yarvin\u2019s work as an influence, is that his writings are largely composed of anti-democratic and pro-authoritarian themes, along with some inclusion of racism (he claimed that some races are more suited for slavery; I invite you to guess what race he thinks that is).\n\nYou see, Yarvin is one of the founders of something called the \u201cDark Enlightenment\u201d movement, which \u201cargues\u201d against democracy and against egalitarianism \u2013 a school of thought that people have equal intrinsic value and are deserving of equal rights.\n\nThe reason I placed \u201cargues\u201d in quotes is because Yarvin\u2019s writings do not fall under the category of rigorous political philosophy. They are often written in a style that is purposefully and pretentiously difficult to understand that makes it nearly impossible to extract comprehensible arguments.\n\nInstead of concrete arguments, Yarvin\u2019s writings are mostly composed of unsubstantiated claims and obscure references that he doesn\u2019t explain to make it perfectly clear to his audience how well-read he is.\n\nDespite fashioning himself as a political theorist, he is far from a competent one. Here\u2019s a small sample where he is explaining that his \u201cdeep-right\u201d movement must involve authoritarianism:\n\n\u201cThe deep right knows that all government is absolute. Because of this, the deep right is only interested in paths to absolute power.\u201d\n\nWhy would all governments be absolute? If his primary reason for thinking that his deep-right movement should seek to bring about an authoritarian regime rests on this dubious assumption, then it\u2019s already completely undermotivated. He doesn\u2019t explain why a government like ours isn\u2019t a straightforward counterexample.\n\n\u201cIt treats all other paths as traps, since they are by definition dead ends.\u201d\n\nWhat definition? Why must they be dead ends? He doesn\u2019t explain or argue for any of this.\n\n\u201cThe more attractive the first steps into a trap, the deadlier the trap in the end\u2014and political traps can last decades.\u201d\n\nWhy would we believe that the attractiveness of the steps into a trap correlates with the deadliness of the trap? Again, there are no arguments to be found. This small passage is highly representative of Yarvin\u2019s writings in general: a lot of bold, eye-catching claims, and very few reasons provided to actually believe them. In most cases, philosophy of this kind is better categorized as bad poetry, not as a means to systematically examine theories and concepts or a means to form rational beliefs about them.\n\nThis is precisely where people like JD Vance and Steve Bannon have gone wrong. They have confused bad poetry that mentions the Dark Enlightenment, for reasons to believe in the goals of the Dark Enlightenment.\n\nIn a blog titled \u201cIdealism is not Great\u201d, he attempts to \u201cargue\u201d that Idealism, and not religion, is to blame for the violence and destruction that has gone along with religious systems. The entire thing relies on him merely presupposing that this is the case, and a fundamental misunderstanding and misapplication of the concept of platonic universals (Idealism): a philosophical theory that identifies properties like \u201credness\u201d as abstract entities whose nature can be instantiated by concrete objects like apples.\n\n\u201cAn Idealist is a person who believes that universals exist independently. Specifically, in the modern sense, your Idealist believes in concepts such as Democracy, the Environment, Peace, Freedom, Human Rights, Equality, Justice, etc., etc. What do these concepts have in common?[\u2026]they are impossible to define precisely. It\u2019s fairly clear that they have no meaning at all. For example, John Rawls wrote a whole book called A Theory Of Justice which purports to be a rigorous rational derivation of the New Deal regime.\u201d\n\nThis is a perfect demonstration of his being well read enough to mention the concepts of academic disciplines but not educated enough to use them correctly. Subscribing to the theory of platonic realism has no bearing at all on political leanings or really, anything of practical concern at all.\n\nThis also has nothing to do with Rawls. Rawls\u2019 work does not deal at all with the general nature of properties. Instead, he attempts to explore the nature of Justice. Contrary to what Yarvin claims, he does indeed define it and it does not depend at all on Rawls being a Platonic Realist.\n\n\u201cA little while ago I explained that religion, if we define it as a system of belief involving anthropomorphic paranormal entities, cannot directly affect reality.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles Opinion Columnists | Thank Jimmy Carter for cheap airfare, smartphones and FedEx\n\nThank Jimmy Carter for cheap airfare, smartphones and FedEx Opinion Columnists | Jon Coupal: New laws coming in the new year Californians need to know about\n\nJon Coupal: New laws coming in the new year Californians need to know about Opinion Columnists | Trump\u2019s claim that we need \u2018extreme vetting\u2019 is extremely baseless\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that we need \u2018extreme vetting\u2019 is extremely baseless Opinion Columnists | Year in review: From a republic to a \u2018kakistocracy\u2019\n\nYear in review: From a republic to a \u2018kakistocracy\u2019 Opinion Columnists | Will Democrats fix their brand problem ahead of California\u2019s gubernatorial election? I had the misfortune of clicking on his link: he does not explain that at all, he just claims that it\u2019s the case. Let\u2019s be as charitable as possible and say that he thinks that by defining religion as such, it becomes a platonic form, which itself could not have causal efficacy in the world. Why does this need to be expressed? A system of belief can certainly affect reality. My parent\u2019s adherence to the system of belief that tells them that God wants them to attend mass, directly causes them to attend mass.\n\nThis is nonsensical junk food for pseudointellectuals. If we were to someday depart from democracy, these idiotic ramblings should play no part in it at all. And yet, it is reportedly informing people in our highest offices.\n\nThere is a reason peer-review exists and it\u2019s not to stop the radical ideas of \u201cfree-thinkers\u201d that go against the system \u2013 it\u2019s a mechanism that filters out unrigorous nonsense like this so that we don\u2019t have to waste time on it. There are plenty of academics who have published legitimate attacks on the merits of democracy and egalitarianism. It\u2019s a good thing that JD Vance and Steve Bannon want to read about political philosophy, but why look to a computer scientist for answers?\n\nRafael Perez is a columnist for the Southern California News Group.

Wolfe went to a relative's home on N. 5th Street where he was arrested, police said. On Saturday morning, Wolfe was arraigned by District Judge Rachel Wiest-Benner. He is being held without bail.\n\nSunbury Police Chief Travis Bremigen said Sunbury Officer Trey Kurtz arrived at the 5th Street home after being called by the homeowner. Bremigen said Kurtz spoke with Wolfe who told him he drove with White to a friend's house on Court Street and smoked what he thought was marijuana, police said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWolfe told Kurtz he was unsure what he smoked was marijuana, according to court documents. He also told police that he used a paranormal meter to check a statue for energy and received a high reading of paranormal activity, which made him feel scared, police said.\n\nWolfe then told Bremigen that \"in that moment\" he believed his friend was trying to put a white rag with something on it over his mouth with the intent to harm him, police said.\n\nWolfe told police he thought his friend and White were all trying to kill him so he panicked and ran out of the house to retrieve his handgun from his vehicle, according to court documents. Police reported Wolfe said he grabbed a gun and put a live round into the chamber, police said.\n\nWolfe told officers that's when White opened the front passenger door of the vehicle and Wolfe fired one shot in what he said was self-defense, police said. White was struck in the chest. By the time medical personnel arrived she could not be saved, Bremigen said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBremigen first arrived at the scene with other officers and attempted to save the victim, he said.\n\nNorthumberland County Coroner Jim Kelley arrived at the scene and pronounced the woman dead, Bremigen said.\n\nWolfe said that after the shooting he drove to his relative's house on N. 5th Street. The relative called police immediately, Bremigen said.\n\nBremigen secured a search warrant from Wiest-Benner and officers were able to recover a small black 9mm handgun lying on the floor of the N. 5th Street home, according to police.\n\nWolfe was interviewed a second time at the Sunbury Police Department and Bremigen said Wolfe gave the same statements. Wolfe added he did not see any weapons on White when she approached him at the vehicle, police said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWolfe told police he concealed a loaded 9mm handgun in his vehicle without having a concealed weapon permit, police said.\n\nKurtz and Officer Gary Bregensir asked Wolfe if it was possible White was entering the vehicle to leave with him and Wolfe took a deep breath and said \"that's a good question,\" police said.\n\nBregensir said he asked Wolfe why he did not render aid to White, his girlfriend of seven years, to which Wolfe allegedly responded, \"I was too messed up,\" according to court documents.\n\nPolice said they also searched a Market Street home because Wolfe said he had lived there, and officers were able to allegedly retrieve a large amount of suspected synthetic marijuana and multiple smoking devices.\n\nWolfe was sent to Northumberland County Jail and will now appear before Wiest-Benner for a preliminary hearing at a later date."

However, perhaps more impressive than simply getting a good book out to the public is that it was a uniquely poised piece of horror fiction.\n\nThe celebrated genre may be one of the most ardently mythologised, with fandoms strong enough to make Taylor Swift blush, but it isn\u2019t always the most marketable to a widespread audience. Stephen King changed all that, and his books became some of the most successful novels ever written. And, as cinema exploded into a new phase in the latter parts of the 20th century, King\u2019s books would be routinely leant on for inspiration.\n\nFew authors can boast as many movie adaptations as King\u2019s 65. The writer has given the cinematic world classics like The Shining and The Shawshank Redemption as well as It and Stand By Me, a range of stories that not only celebrate the unique talent of King but the widespread range of characters within them. The narrative may be what attract most filmmakers to his work, but it is the characters within them that make those movies unforgettable.\n\nWhen asked to pick out his favourite character from his oeuvre, King was quick to land on his favourite. Naturally, it came from one of his scarier books, but still, that\u2019s about the only thing one might have predicted. Many would have thought The Shining protagonist Jack Torrance would be number one, especially considering his issues with Stanley Kubrick over his portrayal. You might also be persuaded into thinking that Pennywise, the demon clown from It might be the writer\u2019s favourite.\n\nHowever, the character King called his favourite to write during a keynote speech at George Washington University was Annie Wilkes from Misery. The picture was directed by Rob Reiner, who had previously directed King\u2019s novella The Body into the definitive coming-of-age classic Stand By Me four years earlier, with stars James Caan and Kathy Bates playing a writer and one of his obsessed fans, respectively.\n\nBates steals the show as Annie Wilkes, the maniacal fan in question who not only engineers the near-fatal crash that leaves Caan in her carer but then proceeds to begin the battle of wits to try and keep him in her home. The movie and the book operate as a brutal reflection on fan culture, which may well have been drawn from King\u2019s heightened experiences of a new life under the spotlight as more and more of his books became global hits and cinematic spectacles.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how Wilkes would become his favourite character. Not only is King\u2019s character an irredeemable villain, but she is able to deliver this terror through a less than usual presence. Previously, King\u2019s monsters would be either animalistic, paranormal or twisted men. Here, with a woman as the lead character, he was able to change the narrative entirely.\n\nThe movie would not only become a commercial success but also achieve the only Oscar that has been given for a Stephen King adaptation as Bates picked up \u2018Best Actress\u2019 in 1991, giving Wilkes a slightly more questionably vulnerable spin. While King would likely resist picking favourites too often, for the most part, it is easy to see how Wilkes may win out every time he is asked."

            "article_content": "It has come to my attention that world leaders like JD Vance and Steve Bannon are avid and enthusiastic readers of a computer engineer named Curtis Yarvin. He has written mostly about politics but also about technology and current affairs.\n\nWhat might be most alarming to some that our future vice president is taking Yarvin\u2019s work as an influence, is that his writings are largely composed of anti-democratic and pro-authoritarian themes, along with some inclusion of racism (he claimed that some races are more suited for slavery; I invite you to guess what race he thinks that is).\n\nYou see, Yarvin is one of the founders of something called the \u201cDark Enlightenment\u201d movement, which \u201cargues\u201d against democracy and against egalitarianism \u2013 a school of thought that people have equal intrinsic value and are deserving of equal rights.\n\nThe reason I placed \u201cargues\u201d in quotes is because Yarvin\u2019s writings do not fall under the category of rigorous political philosophy. They are often written in a style that is purposefully and pretentiously difficult to understand that makes it nearly impossible to extract comprehensible arguments.\n\nInstead of concrete arguments, Yarvin\u2019s writings are mostly composed of unsubstantiated claims and obscure references that he doesn\u2019t explain to make it perfectly clear to his audience how well-read he is.\n\nDespite fashioning himself as a political theorist, he is far from a competent one. Here\u2019s a small sample where he is explaining that his \u201cdeep-right\u201d movement must involve authoritarianism:\n\n\u201cThe deep right knows that all government is absolute. Because of this, the deep right is only interested in paths to absolute power.\u201d\n\nWhy would all governments be absolute? If his primary reason for thinking that his deep-right movement should seek to bring about an authoritarian regime rests on this dubious assumption, then it\u2019s already completely undermotivated. He doesn\u2019t explain why a government like ours isn\u2019t a straightforward counterexample.\n\n\u201cIt treats all other paths as traps, since they are by definition dead ends.\u201d\n\nWhat definition? Why must they be dead ends? He doesn\u2019t explain or argue for any of this.\n\n\u201cThe more attractive the first steps into a trap, the deadlier the trap in the end\u2014and political traps can last decades.\u201d\n\nWhy would we believe that the attractiveness of the steps into a trap correlates with the deadliness of the trap? Again, there are no arguments to be found. This small passage is highly representative of Yarvin\u2019s writings in general: a lot of bold, eye-catching claims, and very few reasons provided to actually believe them. In most cases, philosophy of this kind is better categorized as bad poetry, not as a means to systematically examine theories and concepts or a means to form rational beliefs about them.\n\nThis is precisely where people like JD Vance and Steve Bannon have gone wrong. They have confused bad poetry that mentions the Dark Enlightenment, for reasons to believe in the goals of the Dark Enlightenment.\n\nIn a blog titled \u201cIdealism is not Great\u201d, he attempts to \u201cargue\u201d that Idealism, and not religion, is to blame for the violence and destruction that has gone along with religious systems. The entire thing relies on him merely presupposing that this is the case, and a fundamental misunderstanding and misapplication of the concept of platonic universals (Idealism): a philosophical theory that identifies properties like \u201credness\u201d as abstract entities whose nature can be instantiated by concrete objects like apples.\n\n\u201cAn Idealist is a person who believes that universals exist independently. Specifically, in the modern sense, your Idealist believes in concepts such as Democracy, the Environment, Peace, Freedom, Human Rights, Equality, Justice, etc., etc. What do these concepts have in common?[\u2026]they are impossible to define precisely. It\u2019s fairly clear that they have no meaning at all. For example, John Rawls wrote a whole book called A Theory Of Justice which purports to be a rigorous rational derivation of the New Deal regime.\u201d\n\nThis is a perfect demonstration of his being well read enough to mention the concepts of academic disciplines but not educated enough to use them correctly. Subscribing to the theory of platonic realism has no bearing at all on political leanings or really, anything of practical concern at all.\n\nThis also has nothing to do with Rawls. Rawls\u2019 work does not deal at all with the general nature of properties. Instead, he attempts to explore the nature of Justice. Contrary to what Yarvin claims, he does indeed define it and it does not depend at all on Rawls being a Platonic Realist.\n\n\u201cA little while ago I explained that religion, if we define it as a system of belief involving anthropomorphic paranormal entities, cannot directly affect reality.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles Opinion Columnists | Thank Jimmy Carter for cheap airfare, smartphones and FedEx\n\nThank Jimmy Carter for cheap airfare, smartphones and FedEx Opinion Columnists | Susan Shelley: DEI and the H-1B visa undermine American workers\n\nSusan Shelley: DEI and the H-1B visa undermine American workers Opinion Columnists | Will Trump deportations see troops in California streets?\n\nWill Trump deportations see troops in California streets?

Let\u2019s be as charitable as possible and say that he thinks that by defining religion as such, it becomes a platonic form, which itself could not have causal efficacy in the world. Why does this need to be expressed? A system of belief can certainly affect reality. My parent\u2019s adherence to the system of belief that tells them that God wants them to attend mass, directly causes them to attend mass.\n\nThis is nonsensical junk food for pseudointellectuals. If we were to someday depart from democracy, these idiotic ramblings should play no part in it at all. And yet, it is reportedly informing people in our highest offices.\n\nThere is a reason peer-review exists and it\u2019s not to stop the radical ideas of \u201cfree-thinkers\u201d that go against the system \u2013 it\u2019s a mechanism that filters out unrigorous nonsense like this so that we don\u2019t have to waste time on it. There are plenty of academics who have published legitimate attacks on the merits of democracy and egalitarianism. It\u2019s a good thing that JD Vance and Steve Bannon want to read about political philosophy, but why look to a computer scientist for answers?\n\nRafael Perez is a columnist for the Southern California News Group.

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2014 including the Nobel committees \u2014 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI's potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \"one of the most transformative technologies in human history\". But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2014 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \"illusion of explanatory depth\". Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn't mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \"illusion of exploratory breadth\". Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFinally, the \"illusion of objectivity\". Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nRelated: 'It might pave the way for novel forms of artistic expression': Generative AI isn't a threat to artists \u2014 it's an opportunity to redefine art itself\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI's increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \" AI Scientist \" machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company's vision is to develop a \"fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\", where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2014 though critics said the system produced \" endless scientific slop \".\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \"accelerate\" the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value , further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can't take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \" trust the science \" can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritizes the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2014 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalize the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \"outsourcing\" that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI ? And how can researchers remain aligned with society's expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt's time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2014 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

            "article_content": "A groundbreaking discovery by scientists at Japan\u2019s RIKEN Center for Brain Science has revealed an unexpected link between dopamine and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This revelation could mark a major breakthrough in combating one of the most devastating neurological conditions. Dopamine, commonly known as the \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormone, may hold the key to breaking down beta-amyloid plaques\u2014abnormal protein clusters that interfere with brain function and are hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe science behind brain plaques\n\nBeta-amyloid plaques have long been at the center of Alzheimer\u2019s research. These sticky deposits disrupt neural communication, sparking inflammation and progressively damaging brain cells. Over time, this process leads to memory loss, impaired cognitive function, and, ultimately, the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn recent years, the FDA approved two drugs\u2014lecanemab and donanemab\u2014that specifically target beta-amyloid buildup in early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s patients. These treatments have offered some hope, but their effectiveness varies, leaving scientists searching for more reliable solutions. The discovery of dopamine\u2019s potential role in reducing plaques adds a fresh perspective to this ongoing battle.\n\nUnderstanding the dopamine connection\n\nDopamine\u2019s involvement in Alzheimer\u2019s treatment stems from its ability to stimulate the production of neprilysin, an enzyme crucial for breaking down beta-amyloid. Neprilysin acts as a natural cleaner, preventing harmful plaques from accumulating in the brain.\n\nThis connection builds on years of research into neurotransmitters and their role in brain health. While dopamine is traditionally associated with mood regulation and reward pathways, its ability to enhance neprilysin activity adds a new dimension to its significance.\n\nLaboratory evidence supporting dopamine\u2019s role\n\nIn a series of laboratory experiments, researchers tested dopamine\u2019s impact on beta-amyloid plaques over an eight-week period. These studies revealed significant reductions in plaque formation when dopamine levels were increased. To achieve this, scientists administered L-DOPA, a medication already widely used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, which helped elevate dopamine concentrations in the brain.\n\nTest subjects showed not only a reduction in plaques but also improvements in memory and cognitive function. This dual effect underscores the potential of dopamine-based interventions as a comprehensive approach to managing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nClinical implications for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\n\nThe findings open up exciting possibilities for clinical applications. If further research confirms the effectiveness of dopamine in humans, it could pave the way for repurposing existing medications like L-DOPA to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. This approach offers several advantages:\n\nDopamine regulation could provide a safer alternative\n\nBy targeting plaque formation without the need for entirely new drugs, dopamine-based treatments could reduce the time and cost associated with bringing a new therapy to market.\n\nThis research may enhance current treatments\n\nCombining dopamine-regulating therapies with existing anti-amyloid drugs could improve overall outcomes for patients. Such a strategy might delay the onset of severe symptoms or slow disease progression, offering hope to millions of individuals and their families.\n\nFuture directions for dopamine research\n\nDespite these promising findings, much work remains before dopamine-based therapies can be widely implemented. Extensive clinical trials are needed to assess their safety, efficacy, and potential side effects in diverse patient populations.\n\nScientists are also exploring ways to refine treatment protocols. This includes determining optimal dosages, timing, and delivery methods for dopamine-enhancing medications. Advances in technology, such as imaging tools to monitor plaque reduction in real-time, could further aid in tailoring treatments to individual patients.\n\nAnother avenue of research involves investigating how dopamine interacts with other biological processes in the brain. Understanding these relationships could unlock even more effective strategies for preventing or reversing Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.\n\nRethinking Alzheimer\u2019s care with new possibilities\n\nThe discovery of dopamine\u2019s role in breaking down beta-amyloid plaques represents a turning point in Alzheimer\u2019s research. By offering a fresh perspective on a complex and poorly understood disease, it has the potential to reshape treatment approaches and improve the lives of countless individuals.\n\nAs science continues to uncover the intricacies of brain function, this breakthrough reminds us that even well-known molecules like dopamine can hold untapped potential. For those affected by Alzheimer\u2019s, this research brings renewed hope for a future where effective treatments are within reach. The journey ahead is long, but the possibilities it offers make every step worthwhile."

It was a startup so small and sleepy that the owners didn\u2019t bother tracking their web traffic. It was a quiet day, the last the company would ever know. Within two months, OpenAI was being pounded by more than 100 million visitors trying, and freaking out about, ChatGPT. Nothing has been the same for anyone since, particularly Sam Altman. In his most wide-ranging interview as chief executive officer, Altman explains his infamous four-day firing, how he actually runs OpenAI, his plans for the Trump-Musk presidency and his relentless pursuit of artificial general intelligence\u2014the still-theoretical next phase of AI, in which machines will be capable of performing any intellectual task a human can do. Edited for clarity and length.\n\nFeatured in Bloomberg Businessweek, February 2025. Subscribe now.\n\nYour team suggested this would be a good moment to review the past two years, reflect on some events and decisions, to clarify a few things. But before we do that, can you tell the story of OpenAI\u2019s founding dinner again? Because it seems like the historic value of that event increases by the day.\n\nEveryone wants a neat story where there\u2019s one moment when a thing happened. Conservatively, I would say there were 20 founding dinners that year [2015], and then one ends up being entered into the canon, and everyone talks about that. The most important one to me personally was Ilya 1 and I at the Counter in Mountain View [California]. Just the two of us.\n\n1 Ilya Sutskever is an OpenAI co-founder and one of the leading researchers in the field of artificial intelligence. As a board member he participated in Altman\u2019s November 2023 firing, only to express public regret over his decision a few days later. He departed OpenAI in May 2024.\n\nAnd to rewind even back from that, I was always really interested in AI. I had studied it as an undergrad. I got distracted for a while, and then 2012 comes along. Ilya and others do AlexNet. 2 I keep watching the progress, and I\u2019m like, \u201cMan, deep learning seems real. Also, it seems like it scales. That\u2019s a big, big deal. Someone should do something.\u201d\n\n2 AlexNet, created by Alex Krizhevsky, Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton, used a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)\u2014a powerful new type of computer program\u2014to recognize images far more accurately than ever, kick-starting major progress in AI.\n\nSo I started meeting a bunch of people, asking who would be good to do this with. It\u2019s impossible to overstate how nonmainstream AGI was in 2014. People were afraid to talk to me, because I was saying I wanted to start an AGI effort. It was, like, cancelable. It could ruin your career. But a lot of people said there\u2019s one person you really gotta talk to, and that was Ilya. So I stalked Ilya at a conference, got him in the hallway, and we talked. I was like, \u201cThis is a smart guy.\u201d I kind of told him what I was thinking, and we agreed we\u2019d meet up for a dinner. At our first dinner, he articulated\u2014not in the same words he\u2019d use now\u2014but basically articulated our strategy for how to build AGI.\n\nWhat from the spirit of that dinner remains in the company today?\n\nKind of all of it. There\u2019s additional things on top of it, but this idea that we believed in deep learning, we believed in a particular technical approach to get there and a way to do research and engineering together\u2014it\u2019s incredible to me how well that\u2019s worked. Usually when you have these ideas, they don\u2019t quite work, and there were clearly some things about our original conception that didn\u2019t work at all. Structure. 3 All of that. But [believing] AGI was possible, that this was the approach to bet on, and if it were possible it would be a big deal to society? That\u2019s been remarkably true.\n\n3 OpenAI was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit with the mission to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity. This would become, er, problematic. We\u2019ll get to it.\n\nOne of the strengths of that original OpenAI group was recruiting. Somehow you managed to corner the market on a ton of the top AI research talent, often with much less money to offer than your competitors. What was the pitch?\n\nThe pitch was just come build AGI. And the reason it worked\u2014I cannot overstate how heretical it was at the time to say we\u2019re gonna build AGI. So you filter out 99% of the world, and you only get the really talented, original thinkers. And that\u2019s really powerful. If you\u2019re doing the same thing everybody else is doing, if you\u2019re building, like, the 10,000th photo-sharing app? Really hard to recruit talent. Convince me no one else is doing it, and appeal to a small, really talented set? You can get them all. And they all wanna work together. So we had what at the time sounded like an audacious or maybe outlandish pitch, and it pushed away all of the senior experts in the field, and we got the ragtag, young, talented people who are good to start with.\n\nHow quickly did you guys settle into roles?\n\nMost people were working on it full time. I had a job, 4 so at the beginning I was doing very little, and then over time I fell more and more in love with it. And then, by 2018, I had drunk the Kool-Aid. But it was like a Band of Brothers approach for a while. Ilya and Greg 5 were kind of running it, but everybody was doing their thing.\n\n4 In 2014, Altman became the CEO of Y Combinator, the startup accelerator that helped launch Airbnb, Dropbox and Stripe, among others.\n\n5 Greg Brockman is a co-founder of OpenAI and its current president.\n\nIt seems like you\u2019ve got a romantic view of those first couple of years.\n\nWell, those are the most fun times of OpenAI history for sure. I mean, it\u2019s fun now, too, but to have been in the room for what I think will turn out to be one of the greatest periods of scientific discovery, relative to the impact it has on the world, of all time? That\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime experience. If you\u2019re very lucky. If you\u2019re extremely lucky.\n\nIn 2019 you took over as CEO. How did that come about?\n\nI was trying to do OpenAI and [Y Combinator] at the same time, which was really hard. I just got transfixed by this idea that we were actually going to build AGI. Funnily enough, I remember thinking to myself back then that we would do it in 2025, but it was a totally random number based off of 10 years from when we started. People used to joke in those days that the only thing I would do was walk into a meeting and say, \u201cScale it up!\u201d Which is not true, but that was kind of the thrust of that time period.\n\nThe official release date of ChatGPT is Nov. 30, 2022. Does that feel like a million years ago or a week ago?\n\n[Laughs] I turn 40 next year. On my 30th birthday, I wrote this blog post, and the title of it was \u201cThe days are long but the decades are short.\u201d Somebody this morning emailed me and said, \u201cThis is my favorite blog post, I read it every year. When you turn 40, will you write an update?\u201d I\u2019m laughing because I\u2019m definitely not gonna write an update. I have no time. But if I did, the title would be \u201cThe days are long, and the decades are also f---ing very long.\u201d So it has felt like a very long time.\n\nOpenAI senior executives at the company\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco on March 13, 2023, from left: Sam Altman, chief executive officer; Mira Murati, chief technology officer; Greg Brockman, president; and Ilya Sutskever, chief scientist. Photographer: Jim Wilson/The New York Times\n\nAs that first cascade of users started showing up, and it was clear this was going to be a colossal thing, did you have a \u201choly s---\u201d moment?\n\nSo, OK, a couple of things. No. 1, I thought it was gonna do pretty well! The rest of the company was like, \u201cWhy are you making us launch this? It\u2019s a bad decision. It\u2019s not ready.\u201d I don't make a lot of \u201cwe\u2019re gonna do this thing\u201d decisions, but this was one of them.\n\nYC has this famous graph that PG 6 used to draw, where you have the squiggles of potential, and then the wearing off of novelty, and then this long dip, and then the squiggles of real product market fit. And then eventually it takes off. It\u2019s a piece of YC lore. In the first few days, as [ChatGPT] was doing its thing, it\u2019d be more usage during the day and less at night. The team was like, \u201cHa ha ha, it\u2019s falling off.\u201d But I had learned one thing during YC, which is, if every time there\u2019s a new trough it\u2019s above the previous peak, there\u2019s something very different going on. It looked like that in the first five days, and I was like, \u201cI think we have something on our hands that we do not appreciate here.\u201d\n\n6 Paul Graham, the co-founder of Y Combinator and a philosopher king-type on the subject of startups and technology.\n\nAnd that started off a mad scramble to get a lot of compute 7 \u2014which we did not have at the time\u2014because we had launched this with no business model or thoughts for a business model. I remember a meeting that December where I sort of said, \u201cI\u2019ll consider any idea for how we\u2019re going to pay for this, but we can\u2019t go on.\u201d And there were some truly horrible ideas\u2014and no good ones. So we just said, \u201cFine, we\u2019re just gonna try a subscription, and we\u2019ll figure it out later.\u201d That just stuck. We launched with GPT-3.5, and we knew we had GPT-4 [coming], so we knew that it was going to be better. And as I started talking to people who were using it about the things they were using it for, I was like, \u201cI know we can make these better, too.\u201d We kept improving it pretty rapidly, and that led to this global media consciousness [moment], whatever you want to call it.\n\n7 In AI, \u201ccompute\u201d is commonly used as a noun, referring to the processing power and resources\u2014such as central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs)\u2014required to train, run or develop machine-learning models. Want to know how Nvidia Corp.\u2019s Jensen Huang got rich? Compute.\n\nAre you a person who enjoys success? Were you able to take it in, or were you already worried about the next phase of scaling?\n\nA very strange thing about me, or my career: The normal arc is you run a big, successful company, and then in your 50s or 60s you get tired of working that hard, and you become a [venture capitalist]. It\u2019s very unusual to have been a VC first and have had a pretty long VC career and then run a company. And there are all these ways in which I think it\u2019s bad, but one way in which it has been very good for me is you have the weird benefit of knowing what\u2019s gonna happen to you, because you\u2019ve watched and advised a bunch of other people through it. And I knew I was both overwhelmed with gratitude and, like, \u201cF---, I\u2019m gonna get strapped to a rocket ship, and my life is gonna be totally different and not that fun.\u201d I had a lot of gallows humor about it. My husband 8 tells funny stories from that period of how I would come home, and he\u2019d be like, \u201cThis is so great!\u201d And I was like, \u201cThis is just really bad. It\u2019s bad for you, too. You just don\u2019t realize it yet, but it\u2019s really bad.\u201d [Laughs]\n\n8 Altman married longtime partner Oliver Mulherin, an Australian software engineer, in early 2024. They\u2019re expecting a child in March 2025.\n\nYou\u2019ve been Silicon Valley famous for a long time, but one consequence of GPT\u2019s arrival is that you became world famous with the kind of speed that\u2019s usually associated with, like, Sabrina Carpenter or Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Did that complicate your ability to manage a workforce?\n\nIt complicated my ability to live my life. But in the company, you can be a well-known CEO or not, people are just like, \u201cWhere\u2019s my f---ing GPUs?\u201d\n\nI feel that distance in all the rest of my life, and it\u2019s a really strange thing. I feel that when I\u2019m with old friends, new friends\u2014anyone but the people very closest to me. I guess I do feel it at work if I\u2019m with people I don\u2019t normally interact with. If I have to go to one meeting with a group that I almost never meet with, I can kind of tell it\u2019s there. But I spend most of my time with the researchers, and man, I promise you, come with me to the research meeting right after this, and you will see nothing but disrespect. Which is great.\n\nDo you remember the first moment you had an inkling that a for-profit company with billions in outside investment reporting up to a nonprofit board might be a problem?\n\nThere must have been a lot of moments. But that year was such an insane blur, from November of 2022 to November of 2023, I barely remember it. It literally felt like we built out an entire company from almost scratch in 12 months, and we did it in crazy public. One of my learnings, looking back, is everybody says they\u2019re not going to screw up the relative ranking of important versus urgent, 9 and everybody gets tricked by urgent. So I would say the first moment when I was coldly staring at reality in the face\u2014that this was not going to work\u2014was about 12:05 p.m. on whatever that Friday afternoon was. 10\n\n9 Dwight Eisenhower apparently said \u201cWhat is important is seldom urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important\u201d so often that it gave birth to the Eisenhower Matrix, a time management tool that splits tasks into four quadrants: Urgent and important: Tasks to be done immediately.\n\nImportant but not urgent: Tasks to be scheduled for later.\n\nUrgent but not important: Tasks to be delegated.\n\nNot urgent and not important: Tasks to be eliminated. Understanding the wisdom of the Eisenhower Matrix\u2014then ignoring it when things get hectic\u2014is a startup tradition. Understanding the wisdom of the Eisenhower Matrix\u2014then ignoring it when things get hectic\u2014is a startup tradition.\n\n10 On Nov. 17, 2023, at approximately noon California time, OpenAI\u2019s board informed Altman of his immediate removal as CEO. He was notified of his firing roughly 5 to 10 minutes before the public announcement, during a Google Meet session, while he was watching the Las Vegas Grand Prix.\n\nWhen the news emerged that the board had fired you as CEO, it was shocking. But you seem like a person with a strong EQ. Did you detect any signs of tension before that? And did you know that you were the tension?\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a person with a strong EQ at all, but even for me this was over the line of where I could detect that there was tension. You know, we kind of had this ongoing thing about safety versus capability and the role of a board and how to balance all this stuff. So I knew there was tension, and I\u2019m not a high-EQ person, so there\u2019s probably even more.\n\nA lot of annoying things happened that first weekend. My memory of the time\u2014and I may get the details wrong\u2014so they fired me at noon on a Friday. A bunch of other people quit Friday night. By late Friday night I was like, \u201cWe\u2019re just going to go start a new AGI effort.\u201d Later Friday night, some of the executive team was like, \u201cUm, we think we might get this undone. Chill out, just wait.\u201d\n\nSaturday morning, two of the board members called and wanted to talk about me coming back. I was initially just supermad and said no. And then I was like, \u201cOK, fine.\u201d I really care about [OpenAI]. But I was like, \u201cOnly if the whole board quits.\u201d I wish I had taken a different tack than that, but at the time it felt like a just thing to ask for. Then we really disagreed over the board for a while. We were trying to negotiate a new board. They had some ideas I thought were ridiculous. I had some ideas they thought were ridiculous. But I thought we were [generally] agreeing. And then\u2014when I got the most mad in the whole period\u2014it went on all day Sunday. Saturday into Sunday they kept saying, \u201cIt\u2019s almost done. We\u2019re just waiting for legal advice, but board consents are being drafted.\u201d I kept saying, \u201cI\u2019m keeping the company together. You have all the power. Are you sure you\u2019re telling me the truth here?\u201d \u201cYeah, you\u2019re coming back. You\u2019re coming back.\u201d\n\nAnd then Sunday night they shock-announce that Emmett Shear was the new CEO. And I was like, \u201cAll right, now I\u2019m f---ing really done,\u201d because that was real deception. Monday morning rolls around, all these people threaten to quit, and then they\u2019re like, \u201cOK, we need to reverse course here.\u201d\n\nOpenAI\u2019s San Francisco offices on March 10, 2023. Photographer: Jim Wilson/The New York Times\n\nThe board says there was an internal investigation that concluded you weren\u2019t \u201cconsistently candid\u201d in your communications with them. That\u2019s a statement that\u2019s specific\u2014they think you were lying or withholding some information\u2014but also vague, because it doesn\u2019t say what specifically you weren\u2019t being candid about. Do you now know what they were referring to?\n\nI\u2019ve heard different versions. There was this whole thing of, like, \u201cSam didn\u2019t even tell the board that he was gonna launch ChatGPT.\u201d And I have a different memory and interpretation of that. But what is true is I definitely was not like, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna launch this thing that is gonna be a huge deal.\u201d And I think there\u2019s been an unfair characterization of a number of things like that. The one thing I\u2019m more aware of is, I had had issues with various board members on what I viewed as conflicts or otherwise problematic behavior, and they were not happy with the way that I tried to get them off the board. Lesson learned on that.\n\nCan I offer a theory?\n\nSure.\n\nYou recognized at some point that the structure of [OpenAI] was going to smother the company, that it might kill it in the crib. Because a mission-driven nonprofit could never compete for the computing power or make the rapid pivots necessary for OpenAI to thrive. The board was made up of originalists who put purity over survival. So you started making decisions to set up OpenAI to compete, which required being a little sneaky, which the board\u2014\n\nI don\u2019t think I was doing things that were sneaky. I think the most I would say is, in the spirit of moving really fast, the board did not understand the full picture. There was something that came up about \u201cSam owning the startup fund, and he didn\u2019t tell us about this.\u201d And what happened there is because we have this complicated structure: OpenAI itself could not own it, nor could someone who owned equity in OpenAI. And I happened to be the person who didn\u2019t own equity in OpenAI. So I was temporarily the owner or GP 11 of it until we got a structure set up to transfer it. I have a different opinion about whether the board should have known about that or not. But should there be extra clarity to communicate things like that, where there\u2019s even the appearance of doing stuff? Yeah, I\u2019ll take that feedback. But that\u2019s not sneaky. It\u2019s a crazy year, right? It\u2019s a company that\u2019s moving a million miles an hour in a lot of different ways. I would encourage you to talk to any current board member 12 and ask if they feel like I\u2019ve ever done anything sneaky, because I make it a point not to do that.\n\n11 General partner. According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on March 29, 2024, the new general partner of OpenAI\u2019s startup fund is Ian Hathaway. The fund has roughly $175 million available to invest in AI-focused startups.\n\nI think the previous board was genuine in their level of conviction and concern about AGI going wrong. There\u2019s a thing that one of those board members said to the team here during that weekend that people kind of make fun of her for, 13 which is it could be consistent with the mission of the nonprofit board to destroy the company. And I view that\u2014that\u2019s what courage of convictions actually looks like. I think she meant that genuinely. And although I totally disagree with all specific conclusions and actions, I respect conviction like that, and I think the old board was acting out of misplaced but genuine conviction in what they believed was right. And maybe also that, like, AGI was right around the corner and we weren\u2019t being responsible with it. So I can hold respect for that while totally disagreeing with the details of everything else.\n\n13 Former OpenAI board member Helen Toner is reported to have said there are circumstances in which destroying the company \u201cwould actually be consistent with the mission\u201d of the board. Altman had previously confronted Toner\u2014the director of strategy at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology\u2014about a paper she wrote criticizing OpenAI for releasing ChatGPT too quickly. She also complimented one of its competitors, Anthropic, for not \u201cstoking the flames of AI hype\u201d by waiting to release its chatbot.\n\nYou obviously won, because you\u2019re sitting here. But just practicing a bit of empathy, were you not traumatized by all of this?\n\nI totally was. The hardest part of it was not going through it, because you can do a lot on a four-day adrenaline rush. And it was very heartwarming to see the company and kind of my broader community support me. But then very quickly it was over, and I had a complete mess on my hands. And it got worse every day. It was like another government investigation, another old board member leaking fake news to the press. And all those people that I feel like really f---ed me and f---ed the company were gone, and now I had to clean up their mess. It was about this time of year [December], actually, so it gets dark at like 4:45 p.m., and it\u2019s cold and rainy, and I would be walking through my house alone at night just, like, f---ing depressed and tired. And it felt so unfair. It was just a crazy thing to have to go through and then have no time to recover, because the house was on fire.\n\nWhen you got back to the company, were you self-conscious about big decisions or announcements because you worried about how your character may be perceived? Actually, let me put that more simply. Did you feel like some people may think you were bad, and you needed to convince them that you\u2019re good?\n\nIt was worse than that. Once everything was cleared up, it was all fine, but in the first few days no one knew anything. And so I\u2019d be walking down the hall, and [people] would avert their eyes. It was like I had a terminal cancer diagnosis. There was sympathy, empathy, but [no one] was sure what to say. That was really tough. But I was like, \u201cWe got a complicated job to do. I\u2019m gonna keep doing this.\u201d\n\nCan you describe how you actually run the company? How do you spend your days? Like, do you talk to individual engineers? Do you get walking-around time?\n\nLet me just call up my calendar. So we do a three-hour executive team meeting on Mondays, and then, OK, yesterday and today, six one-on-ones with engineers. I\u2019m going to the research meeting right after this. Tomorrow is a day where there\u2019s a couple of big partnership meetings and a lot of compute meetings. There\u2019s five meetings on building up compute. I have three product brainstorm meetings tomorrow, and I\u2019ve got a big dinner with a major hardware partner after. That\u2019s kind of what it looks like. A few things that are weekly rhythms, and then it\u2019s mostly whatever comes up.\n\nHow much time do you spend communicating, internally and externally?\n\nWay more internal. I\u2019m not a big inspirational email writer, but lots of one-on-one, small-group meetings and then a lot of stuff over Slack.\n\nOh, man. God bless you. You get into the muck?\n\nI\u2019m a big Slack user. You can get a lot of data in the muck. I mean, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s as good as being in a meeting with a small research team for depth. But for breadth, man, you can get a lot that way.\n\nYou\u2019ve previously discussed stepping in with a very strong point of view about how ChatGPT should look and what the user experience should be. Are there places where you feel your competency requires you to be more of a player than a coach?\n\nAt this scale? Not really. I had dinner with the Sora 14 team last night, and I had pages of written, fairly detailed suggestions of things. But that\u2019s unusual. Or the meeting after this, I have a very specific pitch to the research team of what I think they should do over the next three months and quite a lot of granular detail, but that\u2019s also unusual.\n\n14 Sora is OpenAI\u2019s advanced visual AI generator, released to the public on Dec. 9, 2024.\n\nWe\u2019ve talked a little about how scientific research can sometimes be in conflict with a corporate structure. You\u2019ve put research in a different building from the rest of the company, a couple of miles away. Is there some symbolic intent behind that?\n\nUh, no, that\u2019s just logistical, space planning. We will get to a big campus all at once at some point. Research will still have its own area. Protecting the core of research is really critical to what we do.\n\nProtecting it from what?\n\nThe normal way a Silicon Valley company goes is you start up as a product company. You get really good at that. You build up to this massive scale. And as you build up this massive scale, revenue growth naturally slows down as a percentage, usually. And at some point the CEO gets the idea that he or she is going to start a research lab to come up with a bunch of new ideas and drive further growth. And that has worked a couple of times in history. Famously for Bell Labs and Xerox PARC. Usually it doesn\u2019t. Usually you get a very good product company and a very bad research lab. We\u2019re very fortunate that the little product company we bolted on is the fastest-growing tech company maybe ever\u2014certainly in a long time. But that could easily subsume the magic of research, and I do not intend to let that happen.\n\nWe are here to build AGI and superintelligence and all the things that come beyond that. There are many wonderful things that are going to happen to us along the way, any of which could very reasonably distract us from the grand prize. I think it\u2019s really important not to get distracted.\n\nAs a company, you\u2019ve sort of stopped publicly speaking about AGI. You started talking about AI and levels, and yet individually you talk about AGI.\n\nI think \u201cAGI\u201d has become a very sloppy term. If you look at our levels, our five levels, you can find people that would call each of those AGI, right? And the hope of the levels is to have some more specific grounding on where we are and kind of like how progress is going, rather than is it AGI, or is it not AGI?\n\nWhat\u2019s the threshold where you\u2019re going to say, \u201cOK, we\u2019ve achieved AGI now\u201d?\n\nThe very rough way I try to think about it is when an AI system can do what very skilled humans in important jobs can do\u2014I\u2019d call that AGI. There\u2019s then a bunch of follow-on questions like, well, is it the full job or only part of it? Can it start as a computer program and decide it wants to become a doctor? Can it do what the best people in the field can do or the 98th percentile? How autonomous is it? I don\u2019t have deep, precise answers there yet, but if you could hire an AI as a remote employee to be a great software engineer, I think a lot of people would say, \u201cOK, that\u2019s AGI-ish.\u201d\n\nNow we\u2019re going to move the goalposts, always, which is why this is hard, but I\u2019ll stick with that as an answer. And then when I think about superintelligence, the key thing to me is, can this system rapidly increase the rate of scientific discovery that happens on planet Earth?\n\nYou now have more than 300 million users. What are you learning from their behavior that\u2019s changed your understanding of ChatGPT?\n\nTalking to people about what they use ChatGPT for, and what they don\u2019t, has been very informative in our product planning. A thing that used to come up all the time is it was clear people were trying to use ChatGPT for search a lot, and that actually wasn\u2019t something that we had in mind when we first launched it. And it was terrible for that. But that became very clearly an important thing to build. And honestly, since we\u2019ve launched search in ChatGPT, I almost don\u2019t use Google anymore. And I don\u2019t think it would have been obvious to me that ChatGPT was going to replace my use of Google before we launched it, when we just had an internal prototype.\n\nAnother thing we learned from users: how much people are relying on it for medical advice. Many people who work at OpenAI get really heartwarming emails when people are like, \u201cI was sick for years, no doctor told me what I had. I finally put all my symptoms and test results into ChatGPT\u2014it said I had this rare disease. I went to a doctor, and they gave me this thing, and I\u2019m totally cured.\u201d That\u2019s an extreme example, but things like that happen a lot, and that has taught us that people want this and we should build more of it.\n\nYour products have had a lot of prices, from $0 to $20 to $200\u2014Bloomberg reported on the possibility of a $2,000 tier. How do you price technology that\u2019s never existed before? Is it market research? A finger in the wind?\n\nWe launched ChatGPT for free, and then people started using it a lot, and we had to have some way to pay for it. I believe we tested two prices, $20 and $42. People thought $42 was a little too much. They were happy to pay $20. We picked $20. Probably it was late December of 2022 or early January. It was not a rigorous \u201chire someone and do a pricing study\u201d thing.\n\nThere\u2019s other directions that we think about. A lot of customers are telling us they want usage-based pricing. You know, \u201cSome months I might need to spend $1,000 on compute, some months I want to spend very little.\u201d I am old enough that I remember when we had dial-up internet, and AOL gave you 10 hours a month or five hours a month or whatever your package was. And I hated that. I hated being on the clock, so I don\u2019t want that kind of a vibe. But there\u2019s other ones I can imagine that still make sense, that are somehow usage-based.\n\nWhat does your safety committee look like now? How has it changed in the past year or 18 months?\n\nOne thing that\u2019s a little confusing\u2014also to us internally\u2014is we have many different safety things. So we have an internal-only safety advisory group [SAG] that does technical studies of systems and presents a view. We have an SSC [safety and security committee], which is part of the board. We have the DSB 15 with Microsoft. And so you have an internal thing, a board thing and a Microsoft joint board. We are trying to figure out how to streamline that.\n\n15 The Deployment Safety Board, with members from OpenAI and Microsoft, approves any model deployment over a certain capability threshold.\n\nAnd are you on all three?\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. So the SAG sends their reports to me, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m actually formally on it. But the procedure is: They make one, they send it to me. I sort of say, \u201cOK, I agree with this\u201d or not, send it to the board. The SSC, I am not on. The DSB, I am on. Now that we have a better picture of what our safety process looks like, I expect to find a way to streamline that.\n\nHas your sense of what the dangers actually might be evolved?\n\nI still have roughly the same short-, medium- and long-term risk profiles. I still expect that on cybersecurity and bio stuff, 16 we\u2019ll see serious, or potentially serious, short-term issues that need mitigation. Long term, as you think about a system that really just has incredible capability, there\u2019s risks that are probably hard to precisely imagine and model. But I can simultaneously think that these risks are real and also believe that the only way to appropriately address them is to ship product and learn.\n\n16 In September 2024, OpenAI acknowledged that its latest AI models have increased the risk of misuse in creating bioweapons. In May 2023, Altman joined hundreds of other signatories to a statement highlighting the existential risks posed by AI.\n\nWhen it comes to the immediate future, the industry seems to have coalesced around three potential roadblocks to progress: scaling the models, chip scarcity and energy scarcity. I know they commingle, but can you rank those in terms of your concern?\n\nWe have a plan that I feel pretty good about on each category. Scaling the models, we continue to make technical progress, capability progress, safety progress, all together. I think 2025 will be an incredible year. Do you know this thing called the ARC-AGI challenge? Five years ago this group put together this prize as a North Star toward AGI. They wanted to make a benchmark that they thought would be really hard. The model we\u2019re announcing on Friday 17 passed this benchmark. For five years it sat there, unsolved. It consists of problems like this. 18 They said if you can score 85% on this, we\u2019re going to consider that a \u201cpass.\u201d And our system\u2014with no custom work, just out of the box\u2014 got an 87.5%. 19 And we have very promising research and better models to come.\n\n17 OpenAI introduced Model o3 on Dec. 20. It should be available to users in early 2025. The previous model was o1, but the Information reported that OpenAI skipped over o2 to avoid a potential conflict with British telecommunications provider 02.\n\n18 On my laptop, Altman called up the ARC-AGI website, which displayed a series of bewildering abstract grids. The abstraction is the point; to \u201csolve\u201d the grids and achieve AGI, an AI model must rely more on reason than its training data.\n\n19 According to ARC-AGI: \u201cOpenAI\u2019s new o3 system\u2014trained on the ARC-AGI-1 Public Training set\u2014has scored a breakthrough 75.7% on the Semi-Private Evaluation set at our stated public leaderboard $10k compute limit. A high-compute (172x) o3 configuration scored 87.5%.\u201d\n\nWe have been hard at work on the whole [chip] supply chain, all the partners. We have people to build data centers and make chips for us. We have our own chip effort here. We have a wonderful partnership with Nvidia, just an absolutely incredible company. And we\u2019ll talk more about this next year, but now is the time for us to scale chips.\n\nNvidia Corp. CEO Jensen Huang speaking at an event in Tokyo on Nov. 13, 2024. Photographer: Kyodo/AP Images\n\nSo energy \u2026\n\nFusion\u2019s gonna work.\n\nFusion is going to work. Um. On what time frame?\n\nSoon. Well, soon there will be a demonstration of net-gain fusion. You then have to build a system that doesn\u2019t break. You have to scale it up. You have to figure out how to build a factory\u2014build a lot of them\u2014and you have to get regulatory approval. And that will take, you know, years altogether? But I would expect [ Helion 20 ] will show you that fusion works soon.\n\n20 Helion, a clean energy startup co-founded by Altman, Dustin Moskovitz and Reid Hoffman, focuses on developing nuclear fusion.\n\nIn the short term, is there any way to sustain AI\u2019s growth without going backward on climate goals?\n\nYes, but none that is as good, in my opinion, as quickly permitting fusion reactors. I think our particular kind of fusion is such a beautiful approach that we should just race toward that and be done.\n\nA lot of what you just said interacts with the government. We have a new president coming. You made a personal $1 million donation to the inaugural fund. Why?\n\nHe\u2019s the president of the United States. I support any president.\n\nI understand why it makes sense for OpenAI to be seen supporting a president who\u2019s famous for keeping score of who\u2019s supporting him, but this was a personal donation. Donald Trump opposes many of the things you\u2019ve previously supported. Am I wrong to think the donation is less an act of patriotic conviction and more an act of fealty?\n\nI don\u2019t support everything that Trump does or says or thinks. I don\u2019t support everything that Biden says or does or thinks. But I do support the United States of America, and I will work to the degree I\u2019m able to with any president for the good of the country. And particularly for the good of what I think is this huge moment that has got to transcend any political issues. I think AGI will probably get developed during this president\u2019s term, and getting that right seems really important. Supporting the inauguration, I think that\u2019s a relatively small thing. I don\u2019t view that as a big decision either way. But I do think we all should wish for the president\u2019s success.\n\nHe\u2019s said he hates the Chips Act. You supported the Chips Act.\n\nI actually don\u2019t. I think the Chips Act was better than doing nothing but not the thing that we should have done. And I think there\u2019s a real opportunity to do something much better as a follow-on. I don\u2019t think the Chips Act has been as effective as any of us hoped.\n\nTrump and Musk talk ringside during the UFC 309 event at Madison Square Garden in New York on Nov. 16. Photographer: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC\n\nElon 21 is clearly going to be playing some role in this administration. He\u2019s suing you. He\u2019s competing with you. I saw your comments at DealBook that you think he\u2019s above using his position to engage in any funny business as it relates to AI.\n\nI do think so.\n\n21 C\u2019mon, how many Elons do you know?\n\nBut if I may: In the past few years he bought Twitter, then sued to get out of buying Twitter. He replatformed Alex Jones. He challenged Zuckerberg to a cage match. That\u2019s just kind of the tip of the funny-business iceberg. So do you really believe that he\u2019s going to\u2014\n\nOh, I think he\u2019ll do all sorts of bad s---. I think he\u2019ll continue to sue us and drop lawsuits and make new lawsuits and whatever else. He hasn\u2019t challenged me to a cage match yet, but I don\u2019t think he was that serious about it with Zuck, either, it turned out. As you pointed out, he says a lot of things, starts them, undoes them, gets sued, sues, gets in fights with the government, gets investigated by the government. That\u2019s just Elon being Elon. The question was, will he abuse his political power of being co-president, or whatever he calls himself now, to mess with a business competitor? I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll do that. I genuinely don\u2019t. May turn out to be proven wrong.\n\nWhen the two of you were working together at your best, how would you describe what you each brought to the relationship?\n\nMaybe like a complementary spirit. We don\u2019t know exactly what this is going to be or what we\u2019re going to do or how this is going to go, but we have a shared conviction that this is important, and this is the rough direction to push and how to course-correct.\n\nI\u2019m curious what the actual working relationship was like.\n\nI don\u2019t remember any big blowups with Elon until the fallout that led to the departure. But until then, for all of the stories\u2014people talk about how he berates people and blows up and whatever, I hadn\u2019t experienced that.\n\nAre you surprised by how much capital he\u2019s been able to raise, specifically from the Middle East, for xAI?\n\nNo. No. They have a lot of capital. It\u2019s the industry people want. Elon is Elon.\n\nLet\u2019s presume you\u2019re right and there\u2019s positive intent from Elon and the administration. What\u2019s the most helpful thing the Trump administration can do for AI in 2025?\n\nUS-built infrastructure and lots of it. The thing I really deeply agree with the president on is, it is wild how difficult it has become to build things in the United States. Power plants, data centers, any of that kind of stuff. I understand how bureaucratic cruft builds up, but it\u2019s not helpful to the country in general. It\u2019s particularly not helpful when you think about what needs to happen for the US to lead AI. And the US really needs to lead AI.\n\n( Corrects spelling of Ziko Kolter and DSB. )"

Then they start begging their parents to take them to the bakery for a five-dollar, 700-calorie cookie. Crumbl has its own 30-plus person social-media team with professionals who film and photograph the cookies for the weekly flavour announcements. Crumbl has 9.6m TikTok followers. Starbucks, by comparison, has 2.2m. There are more than 1,000 franchise-owned Crumbl cookie shops in the US and 18 in Canada. Together, those franchisees are generating more than $1bn in annual sales.

Musk filed a lawsuit in August accusing Altman\u2019s company of offering \u201clavish compensation\u201d to \u201cstarve competitors.\u201d The documentation that companies must file when hiring foreign workers on speciality visas like the H-1B provides a window into otherwise private compensation data at both firms and gives rare insight into the expensive war for AI talent. xAI is only a fraction of the size of OpenAI; the company employs about 100 workers, compared with about 3,000 at OpenAI, PitchBook reported. xAI reported pay data for 10 worker applications, compared with OpenAI\u2019s 86 worker applications. The companies paid 37pc and 87pc, respectively, above the typical industry wage \u2014 or \u201cprevailing wage\u201d \u2014 for the roles surveyed, based on data from US Customs and Immigration Services.\n\n(Adapted from \u201cPublic salary data reveals how much xAI pays some workers compared to OpenAI,\u201d by Grace Kay, Katherine Long, and Andy Kiersz, published on December 12, 2024, by Business Insider)\n\nDeclining populations\n\nThe world is at a startling demographic milestone. Sometime soon, the global fertility rate will drop below the point needed to keep the population constant. It may have already happened. Fertility is falling almost everywhere for women across all levels of income, education and labour-force participation. The falling birthrates come with huge implications for the way people live, how economies grow and the standings of the world\u2019s superpowers. Some estimates now put the number of babies each woman has below the global replacement rate of about 2.2. Many government leaders see this as a matter of national urgency. Smaller populations come with diminished global clout, raising questions in the US, China and Russia about their long-term standings as superpowers.\n\n(Adapted from \u201cSuddenly There Aren\u2019t Enough Babies.

That is the key finding of a study tracking the career paths of more than 10m people who entered the job market over the past decade. Of the graduates in non-college-level jobs a year after leaving college, the vast majority remained underemployed a decade later, according to researchers at labour analytics firm Burning Glass Institute and nonprofit Strada Education Foundation, which analysed the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of workers who graduated between 2012 and 2021.

            "article_content": "Gus Carlson is a U.S.-based columnist for The Globe and Mail.\n\nWhen it comes to making strange bedfellows, Big Tech is giving politics a run for its money.\n\nConsider the peculiar alignment of archrivals Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, whose mutual animosity has been boiling for a decade. Suddenly, they find themselves allied \u2013 at least intellectually and legally \u2013 in a fight to stop OpenAI\u2019s attempt to change from a charity to for-profit status.\n\nBoth billionaires have filed legal complaints in the past two months suggesting the billions of dollars OpenAI has raised as a charity would give it an unfair competitive advantage if it were allowed to change its spots. Further, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a letter to California\u2019s attorney-general, blessing such a structural shift would set a dangerous precedent for other startups to do the same.\n\nTo be sure, there is lots of competitive posturing going on here. After all, OpenAI is the main rival of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta and Mr. Musk\u2019s xAI in the AI space. And there is no love lost between the Meta/xAI alignment and Microsoft, OpenAI\u2019s main investment partner.\n\nStill, Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Musk have valid points. OpenAI\u2019s bait-and-switch does have serious implications for maintaining the kind of level playing field essential to a free and fair market and cries out for a scotching of any attempt to short-cut the line to success.\n\nBut there is a bigger issue at play here. Aside from the legality of OpenAI\u2019s ambitions, there is an important ethical imperative, too. Such a structural shift runs counter to OpenAI\u2019s mandate as an independent operator of AI development and deployment \u2013 sort of the average human\u2019s voice, immune from commercial bias and committed to acting in the best interest of the greater good.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence \u2013 AI systems that are generally smarter than humans \u2013 benefits all of humanity,\u201d the company says.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s mission statement even calls out the importance of its non-profit structure: \u201cWe are governed by a non-profit and our unique capped-profit model drives our commitment to safety. This means that as AI becomes more powerful, we can redistribute profits from our work to maximize the social and economic benefits of AI technology.\u201d\n\nA noble and socially considerate cause, without question. But wouldn\u2019t the structural shift OpenAI is contemplating compromise its position on the moral high ground and give it a commercial boost in the process?\n\nMr. Zuckerberg thinks so. In his letter to the California AG, he said: \u201cOpenAI wants to change its status while retaining all of the benefits that enabled it to reach the point it has today. That is wrong. OpenAI should not be allowed to flout the law by taking and reappropriating assets it built as a charity and using them for potentially enormous private gains.\u201d Mr. Musk, a cofounder of OpenAI who left the company in its infancy, feels the same way. In November, he launched a second court bid for an injunction to stop OpenAI from changing its structure.\n\nOpenAI has fought back. In a blog post last month, it suggested that Mr. Musk supported a for-profit structure when he was with the company.\n\nGovernment intervention rarely works in situations like this. There\u2019s a legitimate reason that the saying, \u201cI\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help,\u201d has long been the catchphrase for absurdity.\n\nBut someone needs to take seriously the legal questions raised by Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Musk as well as the attendant ethical concerns. In this case, tech\u2019s strange bedfellows are right.\n\nPerhaps seeing OpenAI as a champion or gatekeeper of the public trust is too lofty \u2013 or naive. But, in line with its mission, considering it to be something of a neutral clearinghouse with no commercial motive to favour or disfavour certain tech is fairer.\n\nWith no profit motive, the industrial logic suggests, the company would look at pros and cons of AI development without a jaundiced commercial eye and tend to err on the side of what\u2019s best in the public interest.\n\nA shift in its status would change that posture, perhaps for the worse, and open it to influences and bias. With billions behind it right out of the gate, its potential to disrupt the market in negative ways is enormous.\n\nIf allowed, it would also set a dangerous precedent that goes well beyond the tech sector. If an entity can raise money as a charity, then change its status to for-profit, why would it go through the onerous process of fundraising that private for-profit companies endure?\n\nWhile the legality of the case will be decided by the courts, someone needs to call out OpenAI on ethical grounds. For the benefit of all humanity, of course."

City officials emphasize the importance of these tools for maintaining community awareness and safety.\n\nThese dashboards typically offer real-time or near-real-time updates, allowing residents to monitor recent criminal activities in their areas. Many systems include features for comparing crime rates across different neighborhoods or zip codes, providing valuable context for understanding local safety conditions.\n\nThird-party platforms\n\nSeveral independent organizations aggregate crime data into user-friendly formats. NeighborhoodScout compiles information from multiple sources to create detailed safety profiles for specific areas. The platform includes crime rates, risk indexes, and comparative analysis tools that help residents understand their neighborhood\u2019s safety level.\n\nCrimeMapping.com utilizes official police data to generate interactive maps showing recent criminal activities. Users can customize searches to focus specifically on homicides or other violent crimes within their zip codes. The platform provides regular updates and historical data for comprehensive analysis.\n\nSpotCrime offers another valuable resource, featuring interactive maps highlighting recent crimes, including violent offenses. The platform allows users to set up alerts for real-time updates about criminal activities in their areas, helping residents stay informed about potential safety concerns.\n\nUnderstanding statistics\n\nCrime analysts emphasize the importance of proper data interpretation. Population size significantly affects crime rates, particularly in smaller communities where few incidents can dramatically impact statistical representations. Experts recommend examining murder rates calculated per 100,000 residents while considering the community\u2019s total population for context.\n\nLaw enforcement experts recommend examining trends over extended periods, typically five to ten years, rather than focusing on isolated incidents or short-term fluctuations. This longitudinal approach provides more accurate insights into community safety patterns and helps identify meaningful trends in violent crime rates.\n\nContextual analysis\n\nSecurity specialists stress the importance of comparing local statistics with surrounding areas. This broader perspective helps residents better understand their neighborhood\u2019s relative safety within the larger community context. Experts recommend evaluating multiple adjacent zip codes to gain a comprehensive understanding of regional safety patterns.\n\nCrime prevention experts note that not all incidents appear in official records. Understanding these limitations helps residents make more informed decisions about their safety and security measures. They emphasize the importance of using multiple data sources to create a more complete picture of local safety conditions.\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nLaw enforcement officials encourage resident participation in safety initiatives. Many police departments host regular community meetings to discuss crime trends and prevention strategies. These gatherings provide opportunities for direct interaction with local law enforcement and often include detailed discussions of recent criminal activities and prevention efforts.\n\nNeighborhood watch programs often maintain additional crime tracking resources. These community-based initiatives frequently offer detailed insights into local safety concerns and prevention efforts, complementing official data sources with ground-level observations and reports.\n\nDigital resources\n\nModern technology provides various tools for staying informed about local crime. Many communities use alert systems like Nixle to share real-time updates about criminal activities and safety concerns. These platforms often allow users to customize notifications based on location and crime type.\n\nSocial media platforms have become increasingly important for tracking local safety information. Law enforcement agencies regularly use these channels to communicate with residents about ongoing investigations, safety concerns, and crime prevention strategies.\n\nPractical applications\n\nUnderstanding local crime statistics supports various decision-making processes:\n\nInformed decision-making becomes crucial when relocating or choosing schools. Property owners can implement appropriate security measures based on specific crime patterns in their areas. Community organizations can develop targeted safety initiatives addressing local concerns.\n\nMoving forward\n\nAccessing and understanding local crime statistics represents an important step toward community safety. Regular monitoring of crime data helps residents stay informed about safety trends while enabling proactive participation in local crime prevention efforts.\n\nThis knowledge empowers residents to make informed choices about their safety while contributing to broader community security initiatives. Through consistent monitoring and engagement with available resources, community members can work together to create safer neighborhoods for everyone.\n\nThis story was created using AI technology."

We\u2019ve gone on the hunt for My Faction lock codes, with unlocks from new character appearances to in-game points and beyond. Here are all the WWE 2K24 codes you could ever need.\n\nAll My Faction Locker Codes in WWE 2K24\n\nLocker Codes are a great way of getting in-game items without spending a cent. You can unlock new items, new challenges, and much much more, all for the grand total of zero dollars. To save you the trouble of hunting high and low, we\u2019ve compiled all the current WWE2K24 Locker Codes:\n\nCASHINGITIN \u2014Redeem for 15k VC (New)\n\n\u2014Redeem for 15k VC GAMEAWARDS24 \u2014Redeem for a free Pack (New)\n\n\u2014Redeem for a free Pack WARGAMES \u2014Redeem for 1x Galaxy Opal Free Agent Liv Morgan, 15k VC and 1x Deluxe Singlet Supreme II Pack (New)\n\n\u2014Redeem for 1x Galaxy Opal Free Agent Liv Morgan, 15k VC and 1x Deluxe Singlet Supreme II Pack CROWNJEWEL \u2014Redeem for 1x Deluxe Eras Pack and 1x Deluxe Masked Mayhem Pack (New)\n\n\u2014Redeem for 1x Deluxe Eras Pack and 1x Deluxe Masked Mayhem Pack HALLOWEEN2K24 \u2014Redeem for 1x Deluxe Eras Pack (New)\n\n\u2014Redeem for 1x Deluxe Eras Pack SINGLTLIFE2K24\u2014Redeem for 1x Deluxe Singlet Supreme 2 Pack\n\nHow to Redeem Locker Codes in WWE2K24\n\nBefore you can redeem any WWE 2K24 Locker Codes, you\u2019ll need to have started the My Faction mode. You don\u2019t need to actually fight any battles, but you will have to accept the game\u2019s online EULA. Then, the game will give you a brief tutorial where you unlock a bunch of free cards and set up your My Faction team. You\u2019ll also need a WWE 2K24 account.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll see a Locker Codes box on the main My Faction screen. Go to it, put in your locker code and you\u2019ll have claimed your bonus. However, you may also need to open the card, so go to the SHOP section of My Faction and look in the bottom right hand for the unopened cards box. Select it, and you\u2019ll be shown any unopened cards. Open your cards and you\u2019ll received whatever bonus/rewards they offer.\n\nWhere & How Can You Get More Locker Codes?\n\nMyFaction Locker Codes can crop up all over the place, but a good place to start is the official WWE 2K24 Twitter and Facebook. You may also see them cropping up as part of promotions and advertising partnerships. You can keep an eye out, though the easiest way to get the latest Locker Codes is just to keep checking back in here. We\u2019ll be updating this page with new codes as they appear.\n\nWhy Aren\u2019t These Locker Codes Working?\n\nIf a MyFaction Locker Code isn\u2019t working, one thing to do is to check you\u2019ve put it in properly. Then, check again. We\u2019ve all fumbled when redeeming vouchers, game codes and so on. Also, make sure you\u2019re online, and that your internet connection is still active. And don\u2019t forget to check that the code hasn\u2019t expired. We\u2019ll be deleting inactive Locker Codes but if you\u2019ve scribbled one down on a piece of paper, it could be out of date.\n\nAnd those are all the active locker codes for WWE 2K24!\n\nThe Escapist is supported by our audience.

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2014 including the Nobel committees \u2014 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI's potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \"one of the most transformative technologies in human history\". But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2014 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \"illusion of explanatory depth\". Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn't mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \"illusion of exploratory breadth\". Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFinally, the \"illusion of objectivity\". Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nRelated: 'It might pave the way for novel forms of artistic expression': Generative AI isn't a threat to artists \u2014 it's an opportunity to redefine art itself\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI's increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \" AI Scientist \" machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company's vision is to develop a \"fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\", where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2014 though critics said the system produced \" endless scientific slop \".\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \"accelerate\" the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value , further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can't take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \" trust the science \" can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritizes the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2014 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalize the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \"outsourcing\" that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI ? And how can researchers remain aligned with society's expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt's time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2014 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

Dopamine, commonly known as the \u201cfeel-good\u201d hormone, may hold the key to breaking down beta-amyloid plaques\u2014abnormal protein clusters that interfere with brain function and are hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe science behind brain plaques\n\nBeta-amyloid plaques have long been at the center of Alzheimer\u2019s research. These sticky deposits disrupt neural communication, sparking inflammation and progressively damaging brain cells. Over time, this process leads to memory loss, impaired cognitive function, and, ultimately, the debilitating symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIn recent years, the FDA approved two drugs\u2014lecanemab and donanemab\u2014that specifically target beta-amyloid buildup in early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s patients. These treatments have offered some hope, but their effectiveness varies, leaving scientists searching for more reliable solutions. The discovery of dopamine\u2019s potential role in reducing plaques adds a fresh perspective to this ongoing battle.\n\nUnderstanding the dopamine connection\n\nDopamine\u2019s involvement in Alzheimer\u2019s treatment stems from its ability to stimulate the production of neprilysin, an enzyme crucial for breaking down beta-amyloid. Neprilysin acts as a natural cleaner, preventing harmful plaques from accumulating in the brain.\n\nThis connection builds on years of research into neurotransmitters and their role in brain health. While dopamine is traditionally associated with mood regulation and reward pathways, its ability to enhance neprilysin activity adds a new dimension to its significance.\n\nLaboratory evidence supporting dopamine\u2019s role\n\nIn a series of laboratory experiments, researchers tested dopamine\u2019s impact on beta-amyloid plaques over an eight-week period. These studies revealed significant reductions in plaque formation when dopamine levels were increased. To achieve this, scientists administered L-DOPA, a medication already widely used to treat Parkinson\u2019s disease, which helped elevate dopamine concentrations in the brain.\n\nTest subjects showed not only a reduction in plaques but also improvements in memory and cognitive function. This dual effect underscores the potential of dopamine-based interventions as a comprehensive approach to managing Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nClinical implications for Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\n\nThe findings open up exciting possibilities for clinical applications. If further research confirms the effectiveness of dopamine in humans, it could pave the way for repurposing existing medications like L-DOPA to treat Alzheimer\u2019s. This approach offers several advantages:\n\nDopamine regulation could provide a safer alternative\n\nBy targeting plaque formation without the need for entirely new drugs, dopamine-based treatments could reduce the time and cost associated with bringing a new therapy to market.\n\nThis research may enhance current treatments\n\nCombining dopamine-regulating therapies with existing anti-amyloid drugs could improve overall outcomes for patients. Such a strategy might delay the onset of severe symptoms or slow disease progression, offering hope to millions of individuals and their families.\n\nFuture directions for dopamine research\n\nDespite these promising findings, much work remains before dopamine-based therapies can be widely implemented. Extensive clinical trials are needed to assess their safety, efficacy, and potential side effects in diverse patient populations.\n\nScientists are also exploring ways to refine treatment protocols. This includes determining optimal dosages, timing, and delivery methods for dopamine-enhancing medications. Advances in technology, such as imaging tools to monitor plaque reduction in real-time, could further aid in tailoring treatments to individual patients.\n\nAnother avenue of research involves investigating how dopamine interacts with other biological processes in the brain. Understanding these relationships could unlock even more effective strategies for preventing or reversing Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.\n\nRethinking Alzheimer\u2019s care with new possibilities\n\nThe discovery of dopamine\u2019s role in breaking down beta-amyloid plaques represents a turning point in Alzheimer\u2019s research. By offering a fresh perspective on a complex and poorly understood disease, it has the potential to reshape treatment approaches and improve the lives of countless individuals.\n\nAs science continues to uncover the intricacies of brain function, this breakthrough reminds us that even well-known molecules like dopamine can hold untapped potential. For those affected by Alzheimer\u2019s, this research brings renewed hope for a future where effective treatments are within reach. The journey ahead is long, but the possibilities it offers make every step worthwhile."

            "article_content": "Pinned\n\nDrivers headed toward the Lincoln Tunnel in Weehawken, N.J., on the first day of congestion pricing on Sunday.\n\nCongestion pricing arrived in New York City exactly one second after midnight on Sunday.\n\nAnd despite the freezing temperatures, a crowd of about 100 people gathered at the corner of Lexington Avenue and 60th Street in Manhattan to mark the occasion.\n\nIt was mainly supporters who showed up to clap and chant, \u201cPay that toll! Pay that toll!\u201d But one opponent tried to drown them out by banging a cowbell. And the exchanges grew a bit testy at times across the congestion pricing divide.\n\nThe tolling program, the first of its kind in the nation, finally became reality on New York streets after decades of battles over efforts to unclog some of the most traffic-saturated streets in the world. In the weeks leading up to its start, the program survived multiple legal challenges seeking to derail it at the last minute, including from the State of New Jersey.\n\nIt will most likely be some time, however, before it becomes clear whether congestion pricing works, or whether it can withstand continuing attempts to overturn it by a broad array of opponents, including President-elect Donald J. Trump, who takes office later this month.\n\nNoel Hidalgo, 45, who lives in Brooklyn, was among the first drivers to pay the toll. As he drove his Mini Cooper across the threshold, toll supporters cheered and clapped from the curb.\n\nAnother driver posted a photo on social media of a silver car with metal cans dangling from the rear bumper. \u201cJust tolled\u201d was written on the rear windshield.\n\nMost passenger cars are now being charged $9 once a day at detection points set up along the borders of the new tolling zone, from 60th Street to the southern tip of Manhattan.\n\nImage Congestion pricing scanners above First Avenue at East 60th Street in Midtown Manhattan on Sunday morning. Drivers will be tolled via E-ZPass or license plate readers. Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times\n\nShortly after noon, about 12 hours after tolling began, transportation leaders declared that the plan had rolled out without a hitch, but cautioned that the tolling system was complicated and that it was too soon to know how it was faring.\n\n\u201cWe will start to know specific numbers and have some comparatives within a few days, and we\u2019re going to share that information publicly,\u201d said Janno Lieber, the chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency overseeing the program.\n\nSo far, the M.T.A. does not intend to make any adjustments to the program, Mr. Lieber said.\n\nTraffic data for the congestion zone was mixed on Day 1. The average travel speed initially inched upward 3 percent to 15.1 miles per hour at 8 a.m. Sunday, compared with 14.6 m.p.h. at the same time on the first Sunday in January last year, according to INRIX, a transportation analytics firm. But by noon, the travel speed had fallen to 13 m.p.h., slightly slower than in 2024.\n\nImage The congestion pricing zone extends from 60th Street to the southern tip of Manhattan. Credit... Karsten Moran for The New York Times\n\nStill, the real test for the tolling program will come during the workweek. The M.T.A. said it had chosen to introduce the program on a Sunday to be able to work out any kinks while traffic was sparse. Light snow was forecast for the region on Monday, which could affect commuter data if fewer people choose to drive.\n\nOn a typical weekday, at least half a million vehicles enter the congestion pricing zone, a metric that officials will be tracking \u201cvery, very closely,\u201d Mr. Lieber said.\n\nManoj Bhandari\u2019s car will no longer be among them. Though he normally drives into his Midtown office at least twice a week from New Jersey, he said he would now only take the train. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive for me and it\u2019s expensive for everybody,\u201d said Mr. Bhandari, 54, who was parked outside the Lincoln Tunnel on Sunday. \u201cWe won\u2019t be using our car anymore.\u201d\n\nTransportation officials have projected that congestion pricing will reduce the number of vehicles entering the congestion zone by at least 13 percent.\n\nOther drivers seemed to accept that there was no way around the new tolls. Oscar Velasquez, 54, a carpenter who lives on Long Island, said he was going to have to pay more now to haul his tools to jobs around the city. \u201cOne of these days, they\u2019re going to charge you for walking,\u201d Mr. Velasquez said as he idled on West 66th Street in his Chevy pickup truck.\n\nThe tolls are expected to help generate $15 billion to pay for crucial repairs and improvements to New York\u2019s aging subway system, buses and two commuter rail lines. The work includes modernizing subway signals, making stations more accessible for riders with disabilities and expanding the city\u2019s electric bus fleet.\n\nThose upgrades could improve the commute for Emily Rose Prats, 36, of Brooklyn, who supports congestion pricing. She has spinal degradation and standing for long periods can cause her great discomfort, so she has avoided the subway and the bus, which can be unreliable.\n\n\u201cThe improvements from congestion pricing are supposed to be an upgrade to the signals, which will mean faster trains, shorter headways, shorter commutes, less wait times,\u201d Ms. Prats said. \u201cAll of that is something that will help me be able to take advantage of a public amenity that we pay for.\u201d\n\nCongestion pricing is being introduced in New York at a time when traffic has surged on city streets since nearly disappearing five years ago in 2020 at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. New York was named the world\u2019s most congested city, beating out London, Paris and Mexico City, in a 2023 traffic scorecard compiled by INRIX.\n\nThough congestion policy has successfully reduced traffic in other global cities, including London, Stockholm and Singapore, it has never gotten far in this country. Besides New York, a handful of other cities, like Washington and San Francisco, have explored the concept.\n\nThe program has been unpopular in the polls, and some transit experts noted that neither Mayor Eric Adams nor Gov. Kathy Hochul had commented on the start of congestion pricing by Sunday afternoon even though it will have a major impact on the city and state.\n\nMr. Adams has supported the plan while expressing reservations about it, and is running for re-election this year. Ms. Hochul paused the program in June over concerns that it would hurt the city\u2019s recovery and brought it back in November with a 40 percent reduction in the tolls, down to $9 from $15.\n\nThe tolls will increase to $12 by 2028, and to $15 by 2031. The new plan is set to generate about $500 million per year during its first three years, and then $700 million when fees first go up, then close to $1 billion when the original toll is restored. The money will be used to secure $15 billion through bond financing, which would be paid back with tolling revenue.\n\nImage Revenue from the tolling plan will be used to finance crucial improvements and upgrades to New York City\u2019s aging public transit system. Credit... Dave Sanders for The New York Times\n\nMr. Lieber of the M.T.A. said that officials did not expect New Yorkers to change their behavior overnight.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s going to have to adjust to this as more and more people become aware of it and start to factor it into their planning,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a coffee shop near Lincoln Center, Terry Kotnour, a retired consultant, praised congestion pricing. \u201cThat\u2019s the cost of living here,\u201d said Mr. Kotnour, 82, who gave up his car long ago. \u201cWe have fairly good mass transit, so use it instead.\u201d\n\nAnother supporter, Kevin Chau, 27, a software engineer from Queens who rides Citi Bike, said that he hoped Manhattan would become safer for cyclists. \u201cLess cars on the road means it\u2019s less dangerous for sure,\u201d he said.\n\nBut many critics, including suburban commuters, said the program will do little to reduce traffic while punishing drivers who live outside Manhattan.\n\nOn the same day that congestion pricing began, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey also began to charge drivers higher fees to travel between New Jersey and New York on bridges and tunnels, which it controls. (The rate is now $16.06 for passenger vehicles during peak hours, up by 68 cents from the previous fee.)\n\nImage Empty lanes at the New Jersey entrance of the Holland Tunnel. New Jersey residents have been among the loudest critics of congestion pricing. Credit... Bryan Anselm for The New York Times\n\nRoselyn Cano, 21, just bought a car last week to commute from the Bronx to her job at an exercise studio on East 59th Street in Manhattan because she did not feel safe taking the subway. \u201cAnd then a couple of days later we get hit with the congestion toll,\u201d said Ms. Cano, who sat at a reception desk at the studio tallying up the costs of the new toll along with her car payment, auto insurance, parking and the toll she already pays crossing from the Bronx into Manhattan.\n\nSome New Yorkers were already devising workarounds to avoid paying the new tolls.\n\nCynthia Jones, who lives on the Upper West Side, was taking an exercise class at the studio. Her husband had dropped her off at 61st Street, one block north of the tolling zone. \u201cI walked the rest of the way here,\u201d she said.\n\nReporting was contributed by Wesley Parnell , Bernard Mokam , Nate Schweber , Olivia Bensimon , Anusha Bayya , Camille Baker , Sean Piccoli and Emma Fitzsimmons ."

            "article_content": "Researchers have discovered that a machine learning (ML) model, using dynamic ensemble selection (DES), outperforms experienced pulmonologists in cancer lung diagnosis. Lung cancer is the cause of cancer deaths in the world, mainly due to late detection. Improving survival rates is dependent on the early detection approach. A recent study was conducted by Ricco N. and colleagues which was published in the journal of Scientific Reports .\n\nThis was a retrospective analysis of data from 38,944 patients suspected to have LC within the Region of Southern Denmark from 2009 to 2018. The study included 9,940 patients with complete data, with 2,505 (25%) diagnosed with LC. The DES model involved smoking history and key blood biomarkers such as lactate dehydrogenase, total calcium, sodium levels, leukocyte and neutrophil counts, and C-reactive protein. It was compared against the performance of five pulmonologists in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and others.\n\nKey Findings:\n\nModel Performance:\n\nThe DES model resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.77\u00b10.01.\n\nSensitivity: 76.2%\u00b12.04%, 6.5% better than the average pulmonologist.\n\nSpecificity: 63.8%\u00b12.3%.\n\nPositive predictive value (PPV): 41.6%\u00b11.2%.\n\nF1-score: 53.8%\u00b11.0%.\n\nComparison with Pulmonologists:\n\nDEs model outperformed all the five pulmonologists, while sensitivity was exceptionally high, particularly for early-stage detection.\n\nSignificant Biomarkers:\n\nSmoking status, LDH, serum calcium levels, low sodium levels, leucocytes, neutrophil count and CRP values were the strongest predictors of LC.\n\nThe DES ML model clearly outperformed pulmonologists in detecting lung cancer with higher sensitivity and identification of critical biomarkers for risk stratification. These findings show the ability of ML in changing the current landscape of early detection strategies for improving outcomes for patients at risk of LC. ML-driven models integrated into health care could provide decision-making support to clinicians and may decrease the rate of late-stage cancer diagnosis.\n\nReference:"

            "article_content": "Such searches may also reveal new types of variable stars: free-floating planets which fled their host stars and perhaps even rare classes of supernova. Looking for weird anomalies can also reveal problems with the instruments we are using, which is extremely important. We don\u2019t want to claim to find something exciting and it turns out to be a faulty camera!\n\nThe work I am carrying out with my colleagues uses machine learning to help astronomers reveal unknowns lurking in their data. In the coming new era of astronomy, there is going to be an incredible amount of data; no human can ever get through this data on their own. For example, the Vera C Rubin Observatory, which is soon to open for science, will produce 20 terabytes (20,000 gigabytes) of data every night! We hope that machine learning can help us to find and recommend what objects an astronomer should spend their time looking at and examining in more detail.\n\nThe Vera C Rubin Observatory is one of the most exciting projects in astronomy right now. It is named after one of the greats of the field, Vera Rubin, who provided some of the best evidence for dark matter, the ever-elusive matter that permeates the universe but which scientists still have yet to directly detect. Rubin will snap the observable night sky in its entirety every three nights, repeating this three-day cycle for 10 years, night-to-night, using the largest camera ever made.\n\nWhat Rubin is looking for is differences in images it has previously taken; like the largest game of spot the difference you could ever imagine, built-up into a 10-year video. Over its lifetime, Rubin will take 500 petabytes (500 million gigabytes) worth of images \u2013 which is enough to fill close to four million iPhones. It promises to be one of the best movies ever produced (at least for astronomers!).\n\nEach night Rubin will alert astronomers to 10 million changes in the sky. The changes detected in images are objects like asteroids \u2013 Rubin will find more than has ever been recorded \u2013 or variable stars that change in brightness during their lifetimes, and supernovae, the extreme and violent explosions of stars in the last moments of their lives. It will also do many other things, especially in helping our understanding of dark matter and mapping the contents of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.\n\nMachine learning can give great insights into the data scientists are interested in, but it is the scientist who must decide what to do next. But I don\u2019t think the use of machine learning has been maximised.\n\nThere are many possible futures and excitingly, the tools for future searches are currently being built. There are large spectroscopic telescopes in preparation like the dryly named Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). These telescopes can analyse the light from planets and determine the makeup of their atmospheres and have the potential to reveal biosignatures \u2013 tracers of life \u2013 in the atmospheres of these planets.\n\nNaturally, some researchers are interested in finding even more sophisticated compounds that cannot arise from nature which would be a sure sign of something interesting brewing in these distant worlds.\n\nThere are also new radio telescopes being built, including the impressive Square Kilometre Array, which will be of great interest to researchers looking for interesting radio signals, natural or not, and Breakthrough Listen are preparing the next generation of hardware and algorithms on new telescopes to continue the search for life.\n\nI have always been interested in astronomy, and the challenge of looking for the most unusual and interesting objects in the universe was an offer I could hardly refuse.\n\nWhen I look at a starry sky, I tend to wonder. I look at the planets shining brightly, without wavering through our atmosphere, and I think about how Jupiter must look with its magnificent moons. I see the fast-moving satellites above and think about all the important stuff up there including astronauts, communications and telescopes, and the ingenuity it took to get it there.\n\nI watch the stars flicker and imagine what life would be like around them, likely they are something unimaginably different from what we know, but perhaps there are places that resemble our own world. For astronomers, the lofty goal of understanding the universe can be the most humbling of pursuits, and it always starts by looking up.\n\nDo you have a story to tell or opinions to share about this?

            "article_content": "Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War is now working on its final slate of episodes, and the anime has revealed the first details about what to expect from Part 4 of the anime. Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War has been a massive return for the Bleach anime as fans finally got to see the final arc of Tite Kubo\u2019s original Bleach manga get animated. It\u2019s something fans had been asking for ever since the original run of the anime was cut short over a decade ago, and now this seemingly mythic anime has already made it through its first three parts over the last few years.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nBleach: Thousand-Year Blood War was initially announced to run for four cours in total with breaks in between. We\u2019ve seen the first three of this cours through to the end of the Fall 2024 anime schedule, and now it\u2019s time to get ready for the fourth and final wave of episodes coming soon. Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War Part 4 \u2013 The Calamity will feature some of the biggest moments seen in the anime to date, so it\u2019s time to brace yourself for the true ending of the anime to come.\n\nWhen Is Bleach: TYBW Part 4 Coming Out?\n\nBleach: Thousand-Year Blood War Part 4 \u2013 The Calamity has unfortunately yet to reveal a release window or date as of the time of this publication. Given that it\u2019s really only been a year or so wait in between each cour of the anime, it\u2019s highly likely that it will be the same here with a potential late 2025 or early 2026 release for the new episodes. But until a concrete release window or date for the new episodes are given, the wait will unfortunately feel much longer than it\u2019s been for the other entries. With this being the final one, there\u2019s a lot of inside and outside pressure on it to succeed.\n\nBleach: Thousand-Year Blood War Part 3 \u2013 The Conflict ends around Chapter 656 of Tite Kubo\u2019s original Bleach manga, and that means there are only 30 chapters worth of material left to adapt with this final cour of episodes. Kubo teased during a special livestream last December to celebrate the upcoming fourth cour that this final wave of episodes will be featuring more original anime content like seen in the previous parts. But unlike those previous parts, it seems that there will be entire episodes with materials not seen in the manga (which would make sense given how little there is to adapt before the finale).\n\nViz Media / Pierrot Films\n\nWhat Happens in Bleach: TYBW Part 4?\n\nIn the final 30 chapters of Tite Kubo\u2019s original Bleach manga, there are only a few key fights left to explore before it all comes to an end. Not only do Ichigo Kurosaki and the others have to contend with Yhwach, but there are a few surviving Sternritter members that seemingly only get strong with each passing moment. But as fans have been waiting to see in action, the final arc of the series still has a few tricks up its sleeves as the Soul Reapers have their own power ups and new transformations they have yet to unleash against their foes.\n\nIchigo voice actor Masakazu Morita teased a big finale for it all as well, telling the official website, \u201cThose who watched the third season to the end may still have some vague feelings, such as the \u2018conflict\u2019 throughout the third season, the conflict between others and themselves, and the conflict within themselves that cannot be resolved. However, I think that will turn into a sense of exhilaration when you finish watching the fourth season, which is the true final chapter.\u201d\n\nBut either way, fans will need to be tuned in with Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War Part 4 \u2013 The Calamity returns to bring it all to an end. And with Kubo himself returning to start a brand new arc with the manga\u2019s 20th anniversary not long ago, there\u2019s a chance of even more Bleach coming in our future even after all of it."

            "article_content": "The S&P 500 up over 55% in the last two years. Naturally, investors are likely wondering how much longer the bull market rally can go.\n\nAlthough no one knows what will definitively happen this year, it's clear the broader market has gotten more expensive. So it's even more important to ensure you are investing in top companies that you are willing to hold through periods of volatility.\n\nHere's why these five Fool.com contributors have high conviction in Alphabet (GOOG 1.31%) (GOOGL 1.25%), Micron Technology (MU 2.91%), Brookfield Renewable (BEP 0.39%) (BEPC 1.64%), PepsiCo (PEP -0.37%), and United Parcel Service (UPS -0.07%) as top stocks to buy this month.\n\nAn obvious winner in the year of AI agents\n\nKeith Speights (Alphabet): Many analysts believe 2025 will be the year of artificial intelligence (AI) agents. I agree. And I think Google parent Alphabet will be an obvious winner if that prediction is right -- and therefore a great stock to buy to start the year.\n\nAI agents can perform self-directed tasks to achieve goals set by humans. Instead of only answering questions as chatbots do, they can also go to work on your behalf.\n\nWhy is Alphabet such an exceptional pick to profit from the rise of AI agents? For one thing, the company already offers robust AI agent functionality. Its Gemini large language model (LLM) supports application programming interfaces (APIs) for running AI agents. Google Cloud's Vertex AI Agent Builder makes creating AI agents quick and easy. Google Agentspace supports enterprise-level AI agents.\n\nAlphabet's ecosystem presents a massive opportunity for deploying AI agents, too. The potential applications of AI agents across Google's product range, including Android, Google Pixel phones, and Google Workspace productivity suite, are extensive and readily apparent.\n\nI also like that Alphabet is the biggest bargain among the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks based on one key valuation metric. The tech giant's shares trade at only 21.3 times forward earnings, lower than the forward earnings multiples of the other members of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nCould regulatory threats derail Alphabet's momentum? Maybe, but I suspect not. Alphabet is appealing an adverse court decision handed down in 2024. I think the company's arguments look pretty solid. Alphabet ranks among the best AI stocks to buy right now, in my opinion.\n\nMicron's $50 billion investment is building America's tech future\n\nAnders Bylund (Micron Technology): I love companies with a long-term vision. Micron Technology is a great example.\n\nThe memory chip maker isn't planning ahead for the next quarter or even the next year. Micron is building an America-centered manufacturing network for the long haul, expecting to invest $50 billion in new and upgraded facilities by 2030.\n\nThe company is building an American tech titan for the ages, and having this crucial hardware provider available should grow more important in the coming years. Micron's world-class memory chips are often seen in the latest AI accelerators from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, for example. Apple sources the iPhone's memory chips from various leading suppliers, but Micron is among them and is reportedly in talks to secure a larger iPhone contract in 2026.\n\nMicron's long-term business prospects are downright incredible. At the same time, the company is returning from a multiyear downturn, which started with coronavirus-based materials and engineering talent shortages in 2020. Trailing-12-month revenue has nearly doubled since the summer of 2023, and Micron's free cash flows are back above the breakeven line again -- despite the company's expensive factory-building efforts:\n\nBut Wall Street isn't paying attention to Micron's shareholder-friendly business trends. The stock soared and then plunged in 2024, adding up to a full-year price drop of 1.4%. That includes a 14% plunge in December. Micron's shares are trading at the bargain-bin valuation of 3.3 times sales or 7.6 times forward earnings as of Jan. 2.\n\nIt's a deal, it's a steal, it's a deep-discount sale you don't want to miss in January 2025.\n\nAn attractive, beaten-down stock\n\nNeha Chamaria (Brookfield Renewable): Shares of Brookfield Renewable hugely underperformed the S&P 500 in 2024 -- while the corporate shares gained barely 4% in the year, units of the partnership fell 13% versus the S&P 500 index's 23% gains. However, there seems to be a disconnect between investor sentiment and Brookfield Renewable's operational performance and growth goals. I believe the stock has a solid chance to recover and rally in 2025.\n\nBrookfield Renewable is one of the world's largest publicly traded renewable energy companies, with an operating capacity of nearly 37 gigawatts (GW). The company, however, is developing nearly 200 GW of capacity, reflecting its massive growth potential. More importantly, Brookfield Renewable is steadily growing its cash flows and dividends.\n\nBrookfield Renewable is, in fact, all set to deliver record numbers for 2024, with its funds from operations (FFO) per unit growing by 11% in the third quarter. That puts the company on track to deliver 10%-plus annual FFO per unit growth in line with its long-term goal.\n\nThe real highlight, though, is that 2024 should also be the biggest year for investments into growth for Brookfield Renewable, with the company raising billions of dollars from asset recycling and investing that money, alongside cash flows, into global acquisitions spanning wind, solar, and hydroelectric power assets.\n\nGiven the backdrop, Brookfield Renewable looks like a solid stock to buy in January and hold for 2025 and beyond. The company plans to grow dividends at a rate of 5% to 9% per year, and its shares currently yield a solid 5% yield. As an investor in the U.S., you could avoid filing a K-1 tax form and foreign tax withholding if you buy corporate shares of Brookfield Renewable versus its partnership units.\n\nSnack on this stock\n\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (PepsiCo): It's a new year, making it an ideal time to take a fresh look at your portfolio. That's especially true following two fantastic years for broader stock market returns. If you do, you might find that PepsiCo fits as one of your first purchases of 2025.\n\nThe beverage and snack foods giant underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin in 2024. That's partly because Wall Street was more interested in tech giants and companies engaged in the AI space. But Pepsi also reported some sluggish sales figures as its core consumer pulled back their spending to save cash. Organic sales growth was just 2% through the first three quarters of the year, management revealed in early October. Compare that to the 10% spike investors saw in 2023 and the 14% surge in the prior year, and it's easy to see why some investors have been disappointed.\n\nBut Pepsi is still a cash- and profit-generating machine, which means there's a good chance at a rebound for this business -- and for its stock returns -- over the next several years. CEO Ramon Laguarta and his team are projecting a bit less than 4% organic sales growth for the 2024 year and 8% higher earnings per share in that period. Investors will learn the exact figures, plus Pepsi's initial outlook for 2025, when the company announces Q4 results on Feb. 4.\n\nIn the meantime, there's every reason for shareholders to expect ample direct cash returns from this business as Pepsi sells more snack foods and beverages. For 2024, expected returns of cash to shareholders were billed at $8.2 billion, mainly through dividend payments.\n\nSpeaking of dividends, Pepsi's yield is back above 3.5%, a rate investors haven't seen since the early days of the pandemic. That unusually high payout, along with Pepsi's solid earnings generation, should help cushion returns while investors wait for a growth rebound. The timing of any sales recovery is a big question mark. But Pepsi's dividend payment is not. The Dividend King has hiked its payout in each of the last 51 consecutive years, and it's almost certain that shareholders will benefit from another increase in 2025.\n\nUPS has what it takes to recover in 2025\n\nDaniel Foelber (UPS): UPS is now at its lowest level since July 2020, and I think it's an incredible opportunity for patient investors. But there's no denying the package delivery giant has fallen for many good reasons.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic initially led to surging volumes and margins for UPS. However, as industrywide growth slowed, UPS struggled to offset declining margins with price increases, further hurting volumes. The company was also dealing with expensive negotiations with the Teamsters Union, which resulted in a new contract. Even as UPS laps initial costs of the new contract, analysts expect its earnings per share to rise by 17% in 2025. UPS made several blunders in recent years and disappointed investors. But the stock has fallen far enough, and UPS is well positioned to return to growth in 2025.\n\nThe company has already made significant investments in expanding routes, so it doesn't have to spend a lot on capital expenditures (capex). In fact, capex is expected to be just $4 billion in 2024, which is less than the $5.4 billion in projected dividends. After 18 months, UPS finally returned to profit and revenue growth, so it is already showing signs of turning things around.\n\nLonger-term, UPS has opportunities to expand its healthcare and small and medium-sized delivery volumes. In March 2024, UPS unveiled a three-year plan that forecast healthcare segment revenue to double by 2026, making time- and temperature-sensitive shipments an integral part of the company's offering.\n\nUPS and its peer FedEx have dirt cheap valuations, but UPS has a far higher yield at 5.3%, making it a more intriguing transportation stock for passive-income investors.\n\nInvestors looking for high-yield dividend stocks at compelling valuations should look closer at UPS now."

Unemployment is as low as it was just before the Covid-19 pandemic and near its historic best. Domestic energy production is higher than it has ever been."

            "article_content": "The recently released Thelio Astra from American computer manufacturer System76 is being touted as \"the fastest Arm desktop computer in the world\" \u2013 or at least that's what developer and influencer Jeff Geerling declared after putting the system through its paces.\n\nIn Geerling's testing using the Cinebench 2024 benchmark, the top-tier variant of the Thelio Astra, powered by the 128-core Ampere Altra Max M128-30, achieved an eye-watering 5,003 points in multi-threaded mode. This score edges out the certified world record of 4,723 points set by AMD's EPYC 7713 chip with a similar number of cores.\n\nGiven these figures, it's no surprise that the Astra also excelled in Blender rendering workloads. Geerling specifically highlighted the system's impressive 1.7 TFLOPS of double-precision compute power.\n\nWhen it comes to the overall package, this is far from your average pre-built desktop. The entry-level $3,299 model already packs a serious punch with 64 cores, 64GB of RAM, and an RTX A400 GPU. However, the top configuration Geerling tested \u2013 priced just shy of $7,000 \u2013 pulls out all the stops with 128 cores, 512GB of octa-channel RAM, 40TB of storage capacity, and an RTX 6000 Ada GPU.\n\nAll this hardware is housed in a sleek, quiet tower, which again is a surprise considering the near server-grade specs. Patriots will also be pleased to know that it's an American-made system, coming straight out of System76's Denver facility.\n\nGeerling did highlight some downsides with the system though. Beyond its ultra-premium pricing, single-threaded performance is underwhelming and barely inches past AMD's 2017 Threadripper 1950X in the same Cinebench test. That's sad considering the prodigious multi-core muscle.\n\nThere are also platform limitations to consider. The system is restricted to PCIe 4.0 and DDR4 RAM, which may feel outdated to some. Geerling was also less than thrilled with the lack of front I/O ports and noted some rattling from the PCIe brackets. And if you're thinking about gaming on this machine while running Windows, think again \u2013 Nvidia has yet to release Arm-compatible drivers.\n\nBut then again, the Thelio Astra isn't designed to be a gaming rig or a general-purpose desktop PC replacement. System76 is squarely targeting developers, with a particular emphasis on the automotive software industry, where it shines as a platform for \"rapid dev prototyping.\"\n\n\"System76 and Ampere ride together to make Thelio Astra the driving force behind AV development,\" the company notes on its website. If you're in that niche and have cash to burn, this could be the latest must-have Arm toy for you."

            "article_content": "The task of astrobiologists who seek evidence for extrasolar microbes is as simple as imitation. Primitive forms of extraterrestrial life should exist under physical conditions that were nurtured in natural environments similar to those on Earth. Hence, astrobiologists plan to search for the molecular products of microbes-as-we-know-them on rocky exoplanets with atmospheres in the habitable zone of their host stars.\n\nThe latest Decadal Survey in Astrophysics of the National Academies, Astro2020, recommended a 6-meter space telescope operating in the infrared, optical and ultraviolet bands, capable of high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy. Scheduled for launch by NASA in the 2040s, this Habitable Worlds Observatory will be designed to search for spectroscopic biosignatures of microbial life in roughly 25 habitable zone exoplanets at a likely cost of over 10-billion dollars.\n\nWhere to look becomes more subtle when dealing with intelligent forms of life because they can relocate and spread away from their birth exoplanet. Almost all forms of life, on Earth and beyond, died by now. Those who survive the longest on our cosmic street might have done so by escaping their home planet on artificially made space platforms to avoid existential risks from local catastrophes.\n\nAs much as nature is often viewed as a blessing, it could also be a curse. For example, there is strong evidence that Earth\u2019s surface became nearly entirely frozen with no liquid water exposed to the atmosphere during the Cryogenian period, more than 650 million years ago. Over the entire history of Earth, more than 99.9% of the over 5-billion speciesthat ever lived went extinct. Some of these species were wiped out by well-documented cataclysmic events, such as the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary event which was likely triggered by the impact of the Chicxulub meteor which eliminated 75% of plant and animal species on Earth including the non-avian dinosaurs. However, the majority of extinctions could have been the result of natural evolution with the livelihoods of some species destroyed by changes and unfavorable competition. The situation resembles political views which lose their livelihood after a devastating Presidential election.\n\nThe typical lifespan of a terrestrial species is 1-10 million years. This is an interesting factoid, since humans evolved from great apes through the lineage of hominini \u2013 which arose 5-7 million years ago. Keeping these facts in mind, the human species is getting close to the end of its expected natural lifespan. Will technology save us?\n\nAs much as technology could delay the existential threats from a snowball or a globally-warmed Earth, the evolution of the host star itself sets a time limit on the ability of a natural nuclear furnace to support life on a planet. Most stars formed billions of years before the Sun, and the Sun will boil off all oceans on Earth within a billion years. Recognizing this and other existential risks, a sufficiently advanced technological civilization would prefer to migrate away its birth habitat. This rationale inspires Elon Musk\u2019s vision to occupy Mars and make humanity a multi-planet species.\n\nHowever, once a technological civilization develops the ability to migrate away from its birth planet, it might also be capable of pursuing its goals far away from its host star on an artificial space platform, potentially powered by its own nuclear energy source. This could lengthen considerably the most important parameter in the Drake equation, namely the lifespan of a technological civilization.\n\nTraditionally, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) targeted the vicinity of stars. However, once technology allows escape from natural habitats, all bets are off. Space platforms carrying biological entities or hardware with artificial intelligence may be found anywhere. Technological probes that can self-replicate could fill up interstellar space in less than a few billion years using conventional chemical propulsion.\n\nGiven this realization, it makes most sense to start the search for technological debris around the nearest lamppost, our Sun. This is the rationale behind the Galileo Project, which under my leadership searches for technological artifacts within the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. Our research team operates a new observatory at Harvard University and constructs two additional observatories in Pennsylvania and Nevada. My students and postdocs also plan to analyze forthcoming data from the Rubin Observatory in Chile and the Webb telescope in the coming years. Finally, we hope to conduct expeditions in search for materials from crash sites of interstellar meteors.\n\nWhat other civilizations accomplished may exceed our imagination. Therefore, it is best not to anticipate what we might find but instead search for unfamiliar objects, not produced by nature or human-made technologies.\n\nWe must hedge our bets in the search for life. This means investing billions of dollars not only in seeking biological signatures of microbes in atmospheres of exoplanets but also in the search for technological artifacts that arrive near the Sun from interstellar space. With all these efforts, the keys of life might first be discovered around the nearest lamp post on our cosmic street.\n\nAvi Loeb is the head of the Galileo Project, founding director of Harvard University\u2019s \u2013 Black Hole Initiative, director of the Institute for Theory and Computation at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and the former chair of the astronomy department at Harvard University (2011-2020).

The user said their father, who had significant military experience, was unable to explain what was behind the light.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cMy dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before\u2026\n\nImage: Reddit) Reddit)\n\n\u201cJust after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,\u201d the user said according to the Mail Online.\n\n\u201cMy friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone\u2026 Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.\"\n\nOnlookers were confused by the orb, which appeared to be similar to other objects spotted in the US recently. Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video on December 27 and said they saw \u201cfour strange orbs in formation in what is supposed to be a no-fly zone\u201d in Brookville Blvd, Queens, New York.\n\nImage: Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701) Reddit/YogurtclosetFlat4701)\n\nIn December, while media in the US focused on reports of puzzling unidentified aircraft in New Jersey, it appears some believe we may have our own mysterious visitors. There were three official reports of UFO sightings in Northern Ireland in 2024.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence previously recorded UFO sightings, but closed its UFO desk in 2009 after concluding that in more than 50 years, no received report had ever disclosed any evidence of a potential threat.\n\nNick Pope, who previously investigated UFO reports for the MoD, said the figures sound \u201cstaggeringly low\u201d, and said the MoD used to receive \u201cseveral hundred sightings each year\u201d before 2009.\n\nHe said he believes many won\u2019t come forward with sightings because they fear they will not be believed. \u201cNone of the sightings sound particularly spectacular, and the one mentioning red and green flashing lights and a vapour trail is clearly an aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe annotation on the FOI response stating \u2018noted for information by police\u2019 is a polite way of saying the cops didn\u2019t take any further action, and that\u2019s quite understandable, because it really isn\u2019t their job. That doubtless explains the low numbers, because anyone seeing a UFO will realize this isn\u2019t really a matter for the police.\""

A strange oval-shaped ship gliding away into the sunset like the cowboy at the end of a western.\n\n\"We could only stare, frozen and slack-jawed as it disappeared.\n\n\"I swear we saw something unexplainable in the sky that night.\"\n\nIn 1985 the rest stop was transformed by Australian sailor and UFO fanatic Lew Farkas who wanted to do more with the area's alien history.\n\nFarkas, who owned Wycliffe for 25 years before retiring spoke to Vice about his out-of-this-world creation, where he explained that he arrived at the site in 1985 to conduct a \"five-year experiment.\"\n\nMap reveals UK's five UFO hotspots as expert reveals wildest alien encounters - how does your town fare?\n\nThe entrepreneur hoped to make Wycliffe a true tourist destination and a mecca for UFO lovers.\n\nIn the 1860s, Wycliffe Well was a popular rest stop for the Overland Telegraph Line and later provided soldiers in the Second World War a place to rest and refuel.\n\nDuring this time, people reported seeing a lot of unusual activity in the sky, with soldiers making note of almost constant UFO sightings.\n\nWhen the war was over, people continued to visit the area and report unusual activity which eventually saw Farkas invest over AUS 4 million (\u00a31.9 million) into the site before he retired in 2010.\n\nIt started with a mural based on a UFO sighting in the area that saw tourists come to take pictures as a \"memento\" of the spot, he told Vice.\n\n\"We started converting everything\u2014every wall, every bit of space in the area\u2014to do with space, to do with aliens, to do with UFOs. It got famous very quickly and it put Wycliffe Well on the world map.\"\n\nFarkas installed a gas station, a bar, lodging, a store, a camping ground and even a fishing lake to get alien hunters and others visiting the site.\n\nHe constructed a Galaxy Auditorium which was a 300-seat restaurant with a stage for shows, got a tourist train that went around a Barramundi-filled lake, and conducted at-night alien and UFO tours.\n\nFor those desperate to catch a glimpse of the extraterrestrial, he installed a viewing platform called Mount Wycliffe where people could stand to get a better view of UFOs.\n\n\"Every aspect of Wycliffe Well had to become alien-orientated or space-orientated,\" he told ABC.\n\nUNEXPLAINABLE\n\nFrom the minute he arrived at the site, Farkas knew there was something special about it.\n\nTalking to Vice he recalled that \"there were lights flashing around the sky doing crazy manoeuvres that you just couldn't explain.\"\n\nFarkas said that during his ownership of the site, there were hundreds of reported sightings which had varying impacts on customers.\n\n8 The roadhouse is located 380 kilometres north of Alice Springs on the Stuart Highway Credit: Getty\n\n8 Murals are still visible at the run-down and forgotten site Credit: Getty\n\n8 Picture taken in 2007 showing Wycliffe Well and the Stuart Highway Credit: AFP\n\n\"On a lot of occasions people were getting chased down the highway by lights,\" he explained.\n\n\"They would pull up and be panicking so much that they would say, 'Quick give us a room, we can\u2019t stay out there.'\n\n\"So that was good for business\u2026 It chased people away at times, but it brought customers in too.\"\n\nSome of the tales were so terrifying that guests at Wycliffe would want to \"release their burdens\" which saw Farkas install diaries at the counter to let visitors recount their alien experiences.\n\nFarkas recalled that some guests claimed they saw aliens in the desert.\n\nAnthony Vanderzalm who took over the site from Farkas in 2010 has said that groups of visitors have claimed to have been lured outside to witness odd activity which left him stunned.\n\nHe told Journal News: \"I don\u2019t know what I was thinking when I arrived. My mind was boggling.\n\n\"There\u2019s been four of five occasions when all the people out of the restaurant have gone out and observed something very unusual.\n\n\"It\u2019s never the same twice. All types of different lights, changing direction, and colourful.\"\n\nIf you drive to Wycliffe Well today, you will be met with a sign reading \"Caution proceed with care UFO landing site ahead.\"\n\nBut, it is then abundantly clear that the rest stop has been abandoned though perhaps not by all forms of life.\n\nNow, it has decapitated alien statues, an abandoned train, and a crumbling galaxy theatre.\n\nVanderszalm ended up selling the business to a petrol company which has seen the site fall to the hands of vandals.\n\nNow, the abandoned site looks like a bizarre, derelict theme park with faded murals, broken flying saucers and masses of forgotten alien memorabilia.\n\nDevastating flooding in 2022 forced the business to move out and no one has been back since other than those who wish to destroy what is left.\n\n8 People who have stayed at the campsite next to the roadhouse have reported bizarre sightings Credit: Getty\n\n8 Groups of visitors have reportedly been lured outside at the same time to watch unexplainable activity Credit: Alamy"

            "article_content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken centre stage in basic science. The five winners of the 2024 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physics shared a common thread: AI.\n\nIndeed, many scientists \u2014 including the Nobel committees \u2014 are celebrating AI as a force for transforming science.\n\nAs one of the laureates put it, AI's potential for accelerating scientific discovery makes it \"one of the most transformative technologies in human history\". But what will this transformation really mean for science?\n\nAI promises to help scientists do more, faster, with less money. But it brings a host of new concerns, too \u2014 and if scientists rush ahead with AI adoption they risk transforming science into something that escapes public understanding and trust, and fails to meet the needs of society.\n\nThe illusions of understanding\n\nExperts have already identified at least three illusions that can ensnare researchers using AI.\n\nThe first is the \"illusion of explanatory depth\". Just because an AI model excels at predicting a phenomenon \u2014 like AlphaFold, which won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for its predictions of protein structures \u2014 that doesn't mean it can accurately explain it. Research in neuroscience has already shown that AI models designed for optimised prediction can lead to misleading conclusions about the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.\n\nSecond is the \"illusion of exploratory breadth\". Scientists might think they are investigating all testable hypotheses in their exploratory research, when in fact they are only looking at a limited set of hypotheses that can be tested using AI.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nFinally, the \"illusion of objectivity\". Scientists may believe AI models are free from bias, or that they can account for all possible human biases. In reality, however, all AI models inevitably reflect the biases present in their training data and the intentions of their developers.\n\nRelated: 'It might pave the way for novel forms of artistic expression': Generative AI isn't a threat to artists \u2014 it's an opportunity to redefine art itself\n\nCheaper and faster science\n\nOne of the main reasons for AI's increasing appeal in science is its potential to produce more results, faster, and at a much lower cost.\n\nAn extreme example of this push is the \" AI Scientist \" machine recently developed by Sakana AI Labs. The company's vision is to develop a \"fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery\", where each idea can be turned into a full research paper for just US$15 \u2014 though critics said the system produced \" endless scientific slop \".\n\nDo we really want a future where research papers can be produced with just a few clicks, simply to \"accelerate\" the production of science? This risks inundating the scientific ecosystem with papers with no meaning and value , further straining an already overburdened peer-review system.\n\nWe might find ourselves in a world where science, as we once knew it, is buried under the noise of AI-generated content.\n\nA lack of context\n\nThe rise of AI in science comes at a time when public trust in science and scientists is still fairly high , but we can't take it for granted. Trust is complex and fragile.\n\nAs we learned during the COVID pandemic, calls to \" trust the science \" can fall short because scientific evidence and computational models are often contested, incomplete, or open to various interpretations.\n\nHowever, the world faces any number of problems, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality, that require public policies crafted with expert judgement. This judgement must also be sensitive to specific situations, gathering input from various disciplines and lived experiences that must be interpreted through the lens of local culture and values.\n\nAs an International Science Council report published last year argued, science must recognise nuance and context to rebuild public trust. Letting AI shape the future of science may undermine hard-won progress in this area.\n\nIf we allow AI to take the lead in scientific inquiry, we risk creating a monoculture of knowledge that prioritizes the kinds of questions, methods, perspectives and experts best suited for AI.\n\nThis can move us away from the transdisciplinary approach essential for responsible AI, as well as the nuanced public reasoning and dialogue needed to tackle our social and environmental challenges.\n\nA new social contract for science\n\nAs the 21st century began, some argued scientists had a renewed social contract in which scientists focus their talents on the most pressing issues of our time in exchange for public funding. The goal is to help society move toward a more sustainable biosphere \u2014 one that is ecologically sound, economically viable and socially just.\n\nThe rise of AI presents scientists with an opportunity not just to fulfil their responsibilities but to revitalize the contract itself. However, scientific communities will need to address some important questions about the use of AI first.\n\nFor example, is using AI in science a kind of \"outsourcing\" that could compromise the integrity of publicly funded work? How should this be handled?\n\nWhat about the growing environmental footprint of AI ? And how can researchers remain aligned with society's expectations while integrating AI into the research pipeline?\n\nThe idea of transforming science with AI without first establishing this social contract risks putting the cart before the horse.\n\nLetting AI shape our research priorities without input from diverse voices and disciplines can lead to a mismatch with what society actually needs and result in poorly allocated resources.\n\nScience should benefit society as a whole. Scientists need to engage in real conversations about the future of AI within their community of practice and with research stakeholders. These discussions should address the dimensions of this renewed social contract, reflecting shared goals and values.\n\nIt's time to actively explore the various futures that AI for science enables or blocks \u2014 and establish the necessary standards and guidelines to harness its potential responsibly."

            "article_content": "A new breakthrough may help scientists solve some of the mysteries of the quantum realm.\n\nFor the first time, physicists have been able to measure the geometrical 'shape' a lone electron adopts as it moves through a solid. It's an achievement that will unlock a whole new way of studying how crystalline solids behave on a quantum level.\n\n\"We've essentially developed a blueprint for obtaining some completely new information that couldn't be obtained before,\" says physicist Riccardo Comin of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\n\nThe research was led by physicists Mingu Kang \u2013 formerly of MIT and now at Cornell University \u2013 and Sunjie Kim of Seoul National University.\n\nWithin the physical Universe, matter behaves in ways that are well described by classical physics.\n\nHowever, on a more fundamental level of particle interactions and methods of measurement, things can get a little weird. On the finest of scales, precision must give way to a more fuzzy description represented by waves of possibility known as quantum mechanics.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nWe refer to objects like electrons as particles, and that conveys the impression that they are like teeny tiny little balls. Given their size, the properties and behaviors of electrons are far more accurately described by their wave-like quantum nature.\n\nTo describe the wave aspect of electrons, physicists use wave functions: mathematical models that describe the properties of the wave as evolving possibilities of finding the particle in a specific place with specific features.\n\nSome of these features we can think of as a kind of geometry, often not unlike a curve or sphere that rotates in an infinite number of directions. Other forms of quantum geometry, like those of electrons in a lattice of atoms, are as complicated as a Klein bottle or a M\u00f6bius strip.\n\nDetermining some aspects of the messy quantum geometry of an electron in a solid has previously involved a lot of guesswork based on properties that physicists can measure.\n\nTo measure the quantum geometry of electrons, Kang, Jie, and their colleagues sought the measurement of a property known as the quantum geometric tensor, or QGT. This is a physical quantity that encodes the entire geometric information of a quantum state, similar to the way a two-dimensional hologram encodes information about a three-dimensional space.\n\nThe technique they used is called angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, in which photons are fired at a material to dislodge electrons and measure their properties, such as polarization, spin, and angle.\n\nThis was directed at single crystals of a cobalt-tin alloy, a material known as a kagome metal \u2013 a quantum material whose properties the team had previously investigated using the same technique.\n\nThe results provided the researchers with the first measurement of the QGT in a solid, and from this, they were able to infer the rest of the quantum geometry of the electrons in the metal.\n\nThe team compared this to theoretically derived quantum geometry for the same material, allowing them to determine the usefulness of estimating the geometry compared to measuring it directly.\n\nAnd, they say, their technique will be applicable to a broad range of materials, not just the cobalt-tin alloy used for this study. It's a result that will have some interesting implications. For example, quantum geometry could be leveraged to discover superconductivity in materials where it is not usually found.\n\n\"The geometric interpretation of quantum mechanics underpins many recent advances in condensed-matter physics,\" an anonymous expert told Nature Physics.\n\n\"These authors have pioneered a methodology to experimentally access the quantum geometric tensor, which fundamentally characterizes the geometric properties of quantum states. The developed methodology is straightforward, applicable to various solid-state materials, and has great potential for boosting experimental activity in pursuit of geometric understanding of novel quantum phenomena.\"\n\nThe team's research has been published in Nature Physics."

            "article_content": "Swami Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna |\n\nHaridwar, January 5: In the presence of Swami Ramdev Ji Maharaj, the President of Patanjali Yogpeeth, and Acharya Balkrishna, the General Secretary, the 30th foundation day of the Patanjali institution was celebrated at the Yog Bhavan Auditorium, located at Patanjali Wellness, Haridwar. In the program, with the presence of more than 6,000 officials from the Patanjali Yogpeeth organization across the country, Swami Ramdev Ji Maharaj gave an introduction to the 30 years of service, struggle, and dedication and shed light on the future plans of Patanjali Yogpeeth. While announcing the five revolutions after the success of the Yoga Revolution, he said that Patanjali will initiate significant work for freedom in education, healthcare, economy, intellectual-cultural freedom, and liberation from diseases, indulgences, shame, and frustrations.\n\nFirst Revolution: Freedom in Education\n\nHe said that today, 50 to 90, and in some places, 99 percent educated individuals are unemployed, addicted, characterless, and dull children, whose childhood, youth, and our lineage are in danger. We have decided that first in India and then in the entire world, a new education system will be introduced, and its leadership will be done by India. Patanjali Gurukul, Acharyakulam, Patanjali University, and the Indian Education Board will now establish new benchmarks. Our resolution is that in the next five years, we will connect 500,000 schools with the Indian Education Board. This will be an innovative revolution in education.\n\nWe want to give children not only literacy but also subject knowledge, self-awareness, truth-oriented patriotism, and awareness of their pride and glory. We will include knowledge from across the world in Hindi, English, and Sanskrit, keeping up-to-date with the world, but 80% of the content will be from Vedas, philosophy, Upanishads, Puranas, and the pride of India. It will include spiritual sciences, Sanatan awareness, and Indian pride. This will not be Macaulay\u2019s education system. When the Indian Education Board affiliates first 100,000 schools and then 500,000 schools, India's childhood and youth will be secure. This is the resolution for freedom in education. Through the Indian Education Board, we will not teach the false greatness of foreign invaders, Akbar, Aurangzeb, or the British, but rather the true history of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Maharana Pratap, and revolutionaries.\n\nSecond Revolution: Freedom in Healthcare\n\n\"Disease is not our nature; Yoga is our nature.\" Today, around the world, due to the consumption of synthetic medicines, steroids, and painkillers, people\u2019s bodies are deteriorating. For healthcare freedom, through Patanjali Wellness, Yoggram, Niramayam, hospitals, and health centers, and modern research, we are advancing the legacy of sages and science. We have published more than 5,000 research protocols and 500 research papers in world-class international journals, presenting solutions to incurable diseases before the world. Our resolution is to prevent people from becoming diseased and to liberate them from diseases through Yoga and Ayurveda.\n\nThird Revolution: Economic Freedom\n\nToday, the entire economy is trapped in the cruel claws of a handful of people. Our goal is prosperity for service and wealth for welfare. So far, Patanjali has done charity worth \u20b91 lakh crore in education, healthcare, research, character-building, and nation-building. With over 10,000 centers, 2.5 million trained Yoga instructors, and 1 crore workers selflessly serving, this is the service work of nation-building and character-building. Our resolution is to make the Swadeshi movement so powerful that India can emerge from economic exploitation, slavery, and poverty, and become supremely prosperous. By eliminating diseases like BP, diabetes, thyroid, asthma, arthritis, stress, and depression and saving on medicines, we save \u20b9700 to \u20b92,000 lakh crore annually for the country.\n\nFourth Revolution: Intellectual and Cultural Freedom\n\nIndia, which first gave the message of spiritual world knowledge to the world, cannot afford to endure intellectual and cultural slavery. Today, India depends on impoverished countries for everything, which have nothing but paper money, dollars, or pounds. True wealth is not just money but also good health, a happy family, character, spiritual wealth, and divine virtues. We must liberate India from intellectual and cultural slavery. Hence, we aim to elevate Sanatan Dharma, Vedic Dharma, Sage Dharma, and Yoga Dharma as the new religion of the era. More than 500 crore people worldwide have faith in Yoga Dharma and Sanatan Dharma. If we walk together, we will end religious terrorism, political terrorism, and the terror being perpetuated in the name of education and healthcare.\n\nFifth Revolution: Freedom from Addictions, Diseases, and Indulgences\n\nA dangerous game of addiction is spreading worldwide. In India, addiction has destroyed lives through diseases, intoxication, and obscenity. Our resolution is freedom from diseases, addictions, and obscenity. On completing 30 years, Patanjali resolves to make the world Yoga-oriented and create ideal global citizens through character-building.\n\nRemarks by Acharya Balkrishna Ji Maharaj\n\nAcharya Balkrishna remarked that with Swami Ji's unrelenting and extraordinary efforts, Patanjali's contribution is inspiring the world. Patanjali runs campaigns for charity using profits from its business. Patanjali is not a market but a family for India. With a team of over 500 world-class scientists, Patanjali is making evidence-based Ayurvedic medicines like juices, herbs, and tablets accessible worldwide. By integrating India\u2019s ancient knowledge with modern science, Patanjali has brought Yoga from caves to the masses, reaching millions in over 200 countries."
