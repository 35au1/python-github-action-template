            "article_content": "getty image / istockphoto composite\n\nWe can now add former NASCAR star Mark Martin to the ever-growing list of famous people who claim to have had a bizarre encounter with a UFO. And his encounter sounds a whole lot like a lot of other UFO encounters that have been experienced by pilots of planes.\n\nMartin, who was active in the NASCAR Cup Series from 1982 to 2012, says his UFO encounter occurred while he was flying home to Daytona from a NASCAR race up north.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot, going back to where we started [the conversation], the crazy 2024, lot of UFO sightings, lot of drones, a lot of speculation, not a lot of answers though,\u201d Chase Holden said in an interview this week with Mark Martin. \u201cAnd it ties into you, which, blew my mind last night, when I did get the message. But apparently in the late 90s you had a UFO sighting. You experienced a UFO. What what happened? What\u2019s this story?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were coming home, just me and my pilot in my jet,\u201d Martin explained. \u201cWe were coming back from one of the northeast races. Either Loudon or, couldn\u2019t be Pocono. I don\u2019t know if it was Loudon or if it was Dover, or where it was. We were coming home. It was late though, that\u2019s the thing I don\u2019t understand, but it was dark. Dark, dark. We fly at 45,000 feet, but going over Jacksonville going home to Daytona where I lived, you know, they would bring you down to 18,000 feet or so.\n\n\u201cWe were descending. For some reason, a lot of times after the race I would get in the back and let my \u2013 was a single pilot aircraft so I\u2019d let my pilot fly me home and I\u2019d sit back there and rehash the race or something or just relax. But this particular time, and I did it from time to time, I wanted to fly. So I\u2019m in the pilot seat and Jason Simpson was my co-pilot. He was in the right seat and we\u2019re descending through Jacksonville about 19,000 feet and there\u2019s no stars out.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s black. Everything except the lights in Daytona, Orlando, and you know, Miami,\u201d Martin continued, explaining his strange encounter with a UFO. \u201cYou can see the lights down at Miami even. And I see a light that is solid white light, looks solid light that\u2019s not flashing, and that could only be like a landing light is the only thing that would make sense would be a spotlight looking light like that, and it would have to be far away because I couldn\u2019t see the green and red wing tip lights. Because they got a green one and a red one and the red one is on the right. That way you know if a plane\u2019s coming toward you or going away. See? You get me? Which side the lights on. So none none of that. Didn\u2019t see any of that.\n\n\u201cSo, I keep it in my eye, I keep checking up there and checking up there and it gets closer and closer, I didn\u2019t say anything to Jason I\u2019m just flying along. Finally, I just start, I fixate on it. Plane\u2019s on autopilot \u2026 and so I\u2019m fixated on it and it gets closer and closer and closer and then it gets like, oh my God, we\u2019re going to hit that!\n\n\u201cAnd I grabbed the yolk and kicked it off autopilot and was getting ready to jerk the plane to the right and Jason was like, \u2018What?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Look!\u2019 And when he looked, he pulled out a camera, he had a camera on him, and he pulled out a camera and put it up there in the windshield and tried to take a picture because he saw it! We both saw this and almost, we thought we were going to hit it. Then it starts pulling away, gradually pulling away, slowly pulling away.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker: when Mark Martin contacted air traffic control about the UFO they had encountered they said Martin\u2019s plane was the only aircraft in the area."

From virtual fitness coaches and sustainable content creation platforms to innovative networking assistants, these standout apps demonstrate how AI is making life more efficient, connected, and purposeful.\n\nThe key to their success lies in their ability to deliver real value\u2014whether it's helping users achieve their fitness goals, unleash creativity, build meaningful relationships, or take small steps toward a better future.

This results in the easy creation of see-through elements such as smoke as well as accurate reflections and ethereal effects, which all blend and animation naturally in a scene.\n\nCurrently AI apps and models can only generate solid images, which restricts how the data and scenes being generated can be used. TransPixar has just changed the way AI generates effects and scenes, and could be truly a significant release.\n\nIn the white paper Yijun Li, project leader at Adobe Research, wrote: \"Alpha channels are crucial for visual effects, allowing transparent elements like smoke and reflections to blend seamlessly into scenes. However, generating RGBA video, which includes alpha channels for transparency, remains a challenge due to limited datasets and the difficulty of adapting existing models.\"\n\nAs development costs in film and video games increase to wild proportions AI could be the way studios cut costs, and do so without reducing staff numbers. The hope is AI like TransPixar can make life easier for VFX artists, not replace them, while helping smaller studios and solo developers compete.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the demos released with the open source code, Adobe's team showed how TransPixar can deliver impressive results, including a varied mix of effects, from simple text prompts. The demos include emerging smoke clouds, an electrical portal and a swirling asteroid belt. The AI model can even animate still images with transparent effects.\n\nThe Adobe team has released the code, making it available on GitHub for developers to test and advance, as well as a demo on Hugging Face. TransPixar is in its early stages but I'd love to see how this is developed, perhaps as an After Effects plugin or Cinema 4D plugin."

            "article_content": "Alibaba Group Holding's cloud computing unit launched a novel artificial intelligence (AI) coder that is touted as capable of building an application \"in minutes\", sparking plenty of discourse among software programmers in mainland China.\n\nThe AI coder, part of Alibaba Cloud's AI programming tool called Tongyi Lingma, can perform a set of automated tasks - from comprehending prompts, writing code and debugging software - to complete development of an app \"as fast as a few minutes\", according to a company statement on Wednesday. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nThe system is powered by Alibaba Cloud's Tongyi Qianwen family of large language models (LLMs) - the technology behind generative AI (GenAI) services like ChatGPT - and improves code development efficiency \"by over 10 times\", the company said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nIts launch has fanned speculation among Chinese programmers that this tool can surpass those from US firms like ChatGPT creator OpenAI, as Alibaba Cloud touted its AI coder as the world's first such system that supports both Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and JetBrains' IDEs - two popular integrated software-development platforms used in the industry.\n\nShanghai-based software engineer Frank Lin said he had previously used the coding tool on ChatGPT's website, which can handle routine coding tasks but has limited \"creative abilities\".\n\n\"The Alibaba Cloud one looks stronger than the ChatGPT one by its introduction,\" Lin said, adding that he would be willing to pay for the new service if it proves to be competitive.\n\nAlibaba Cloud is seeing growing domestic adoption of its artificial intelligence programming tool, Tongyi Lingma.

While realistic psychological thrillers can be very eerie, sometimes paranormal movies\u2014with their jump scares and disturbing imagery\u2014can be even more terrifying. Whether about ghosts, witches, or monsters, the scariest paranormal movies examine an evil force beyond human comprehension and how much of an effect its haunting has on an unsuspecting victim.\n\nWhether you're a horror aficionado or prefer movies that even scaredy cats can watch, if you're in the mood to watch something spooky that will keep you at the edge of your seat, look no further for the best paranormal movies.\n\n'The Autopsy of Jane Doe' (2016)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nLike others on this list, this falls into the category of underrated scary movie. It follows a coroner and his son (Brian Cox and Emile Hirsch, respectively) who perform an autopsy on an unidentified woman and are increasingly terrified by what they find inside her.\n\n'The Babadook' (2014)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nThe Babadook is a smart rumination on grief\u2014but it's also beyond terrifying. A widow (Essie Davis) and her young son (Noah Wiseman) discover a book called The Babadook, and then the titular character decides to visit them. Their increasingly erratic behavior means that essentially no one believes them.\n\n'The Blair Witch Project' (1999)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Blair Witch Project was deliberately marketed as a true story, including insinuating that the actors were indeed \"missing\" after an ill-fated trip to the woods in search of a witch. So, it was quite a cinematic experience watching this found-footage film at the time and thinking it was real\u2014and even still, it's extremely eerie.\n\n'Candyman' (1992)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nDon't believe in urban legends? Well, graduate student Helen (Virgina Madsen) didn't either, before she invoked the Candyman (Tony Todd) legend by speaking his name five times into a mirror.\n\n'The Conjuring' (2013)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nWhile this is considered a loose interpretation of the paranormal investigations by real-life figures Ed and Lorraine Warren, the story is still scary as heck. A family moves into a house, starts experiencing some scary stuff, and can't really move\u2014they're literally and figuratively trapped.\n\n'The Descent' (2005)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nIf you have claustrophobia, we'd strongly recommend you not watch this. Six adventuresome women decide to go spelunking as a part of their girls' trip and end up lost in an uncharted cave system\u2014oh, and they're sharing the space with some humanoid inhabitants.\n\n'Evil Dead' (1981)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is a shining example of how a low-budget horror film can still be very scary. Despite the now-predictable premise (a group of college students goes out to a cabin in the woods and things go very, very badly), the film stays fresh\u2014even now\u2014by refusing to pull a single punch.\n\n'The Exorcist' (1973)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nThe Exorcist is the original stellar paranormal film\u2014and among the best movies of all time. Its efficacy hinges on how seriously it takes the premise about a girl (Linda Blair) possessed by a malevolent force and the religious leaders performing an exorcism on her to stop it.\n\n'Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum' (2018)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nFound-footage is an impressively rich genre for the paranormal movie. In this cool setup, a horror web series crew is enlisted to investigate an abandoned psychiatric hospital. Fun fact: This became the third most-watched horror film in South Korea after its release (and it remains one of the best Korean horror movies of all time).\n\n'Hereditary' (2018)\n\nCredit: Getty Images\n\nThis is one of those movies that benefits from a second and third watch; the clues are all there, but when you're watching Hereditary for the first time, you're too busy being terrified to notice. It also makes the argument that a whole family could be cursed.\n\n'High Tension' (2003)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether or not this movie is about the paranormal is up for debate, but that's half of what keeps you at the edge of your seat. Without spoiling much of the plot or its impressive twist, High Tension follows a woman (Ma\u00efwenn Le Besco) and her friend/crush (C\u00e9cile de France) as they go away for the weekend\u2014only to find themselves at the mercy of a vengeful, unkillable sociopath (Philippe Nahon).\n\n'Host' (2020)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nThis brilliant film\u2014which almost entirely takes place over Zoom\u2014captures the experience of COVID-19 isolation but adds a paranormal twist. Several friends decide to conduct an online seance (already a terrible idea) and then unwittingly release something from the beyond.\n\n'Insidious' (2010)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nFor parents, this one's particularly bone-chilling: a young boy (Ty Simpkins) goes into the attic of the family's new house, falls off the ladder, and goes into a coma. And then a whole bunch of supernatural stuff starts happening, with their son unable to wake up.\n\n'It: Chapter One' (2017)\n\nCredit: WARNER BROTHERS\n\nIf you're familiar with the Stephen King book or its 1990 miniseries, you'll know that the \"It\" in question takes the form of what you fear most (but mostly presents at the terrorizing clown Pennywise). Thanks to incredible makeup aand CGI and an amazing young cast, the story was made even more frightening by this 2017 version.\n\n'It Follows' (2015)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis film features a supernatural force that doubles as a fascinating analogy. Teenager Jay (Maika Monroe) hooks up with a guy\u2014only for him to tell her that he's passed on an evil entity to her. However, whatever \"It\" is, it's invisible, making this paranormal game of cat-and-mouse especially chilling.\n\n'Oculus' (2013)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nThe idea of a supernatural mirror that causes increasingly evil hallucinations could have made for a silly movie. But Oculus manages to turn the concept into an effective family drama, told partially in flashback to indicate how frightening circumstances became for the two kids (Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaites) living under its influence.\n\n'The Omen' (1976)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nSkip the remake and go straight to the 1976 original starring Gregory Peck. Imagine, if you will, that you slowly start to suspect there's something wrong with your young son...only to have someone tell you he's the Antichrist. \"Look at me, Damien! It's all for you!\" It's a classic for a reason.\n\n'Onibaba' (1964)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nOnibaba is a classic Japanese horror movie about two women (Nobuko Otowa and Jitsuko Yoshimura) who murder and loot the bodies of deserting soldiers as a means of survival. Their plans go awry when one of the women is seduced by a soldier, and while much of the film is focused on their shift in dynamic, there is a malevolent force at play.\n\n'The Others' (2001)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis is one of the more restrained paranormal films on this list, but no less terrifying (thanks to a stellar performance by Nicole Kidman). All you need to know is that it follows a young mother and her two children as they're haunted by mysterious spirits\u2014and that it results in one of the best twists in movie history.\n\n'Paranormal Activity' (2007)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nThis movie was shot for about only $15,000 before it spawned a whole franchise of films; its premise and execution were just that good. Katie and Micah move in together, with Katie insisting she's been haunted by evil forces since she was a kid. Micah decides he should film them while they're sleeping to see if they can capture them. You can bet that doesn't turn out to be the best idea.\n\n'Poltergeist' (1982)\n\nCredit: MGM\n\n\"They're heeeeere!\" If you grew up in the '80s, you'll remember this Steven Spielberg-written horror movie. A family moves into a seemingly bucolic home, only to find that their white picket fence comes with some strange, supernatural entities...and they're obsessed with the kids.\n\n'[\u2022REC]' (2007)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\n[\u2022REC] is a Spanish found-footage horror movie (later remade into a not-as-great English-language version). A reporter (Manuela Velasco) and her cameraman (Pablo Rosso) shadow a bunch of firefighters as they follow an emergency call into a building\u2014only to become sealed inside and quarantined because of a mysterious virus. As you might expect, it's no ordinary virus.\n\n'The Ring' (2002)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis is a rare case in which the original Japanese movie Ringu and the American adaptation Ring are just as compelling. If you don't know much about the film, don't spoil it for yourself, and give yourself over to the idea that there's a haunted videotape out in the world. Be prepared for the jump scare of your life.\n\n'Rosemary's Baby' (1968)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nEverybody's had bad neighbors, but Rosemary (Mia Farrow) has the worst. This classic is equally terrifying and depressing while being surprisingly subversive and funny. It also pulls off a wild premise: Is the creepy couple in your building just nosy, or are they more sinister? Very much the latter, as it turns out.\n\n'The Shining' (1980)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nThis movie isn't gory or plagued by jump scares; instead, it relies on mounting dread to scare you half to death. A man (Jack Nicholson), with a history of violence and alcoholism, is stuck with his family for months in a remote and abandoned hotel\u2014which just so happens to be evil.\n\n'Sinister' (2012)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nAn author (Ethan Hawke) moves his unsuspecting family into a house that was previously the site of something gruesome. The sinister entity starts exerting influence over him and his family. Unlike many other paranormal movies, you get to know what's behind everything, to terrifying effect.\n\n'Skinamarink' (2022)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis movie is experimental and not for everyone (certainly not for horror fans who prefer jump-scare-ladden movies). But it's a moody, eerie piece that became a word-of-mouth hit, with a frightening premise: a girl (Dali Rose Tetreault) and a boy (Lucas Paul) wake up to find their parents, along with all the windows and doors in their house, gone.\n\n'Suspiria' (1977)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nThe Luca Guadagnino-helmed remake goes in interesting directions, but Dario Argento's original 1977 film is creative, visually stunning, and horrifying. A young ballet dancer (Jessica Harper) attends a dance academy in West Germany, only to find it an increasingly terrifying experience.\n\n'The Taking of Deborah Logan' (2014)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nThis is a smaller indie with a gripping premise that's worth watching. It centers on a documentary crew as they follow Deborah Logan (Jill Larson), a woman in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, and her caretaker daughter (Anne Ramsay). But is the old woman really experiencing dementia? Or is something way, way worse happening?\n\n'Talk to Me' (2022)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nIf you fell into possession of a severed, embalmed hand, and you discovered that you could use it to contact the dead, would you play around with it? That's exactly what a bunch of teenagers do in Talk to Me\u2014and, unfortunately, things start to go as badly as you expect.\n\n'The Thing' (1982)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile this is a sci-fi-horror hybrid, it remains one of the most tense watches you'll ever experience. Scientists in Antarctica come across Norwegian scientists who appear to have gone mad. However, they discover that whatever they found out there in the snow and made them grow insane is more insidious than expected\u2014and determined.\n\n'The VVitch' (2015)\n\nCredit: Alamy\n\nOnce you acclimate to the Puritan English, Robert Eggers' debut feature is a taut and terrifying story. After being expelled from their community in colonial New England, a family goes out into the woods....where something begins to target them. Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), their teenage daughter, is increasingly blamed for the occurrences\u2014leaving you to question what's really unfolding."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nTubular incomplete specimens of Eopriapulites sphinx from the early Cambrian Kuanchuanpu Formation, showing their ventral nerve cord. Credit: Science Advances (2025). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adr0896\n\nAn international team of scientists has uncovered a fascinating piece of the evolutionary puzzle: how the ventral nerve cord, a key component of the central nervous system, evolved in ecdysozoan animals, a group that includes insects, nematodes, and priapulid worms.\n\nTheir findings, published in a paper titled \"Preservation and early evolution of scalidophoran ventral nerve cord\" in Science Advances, provide valuable insights into the origins of these structures in the basal Cambrian period.\n\nThe research team, comprising Dr. Deng Wang (Northwest University), Dr. Jean Vannier (Universit\u00e9 de Lyon), Dr. Chema Martin-Dur\u00e1n (Queen Mary University of London), and Dr. Mar\u00eda Herranz (Rey Juan Carlos University), analyzed exceptionally well-preserved fossils from key Cambrian deposits. These fossils include representatives of the early-evolving Scalidophora, a subgroup of Ecdysozoa, offering a rare glimpse into the nervous system architecture of ancient animals.\n\nEcdysozoans include arthropods (such as insects and crabs), nematodes (roundworms), and smaller groups like kinorhynchs (\"mud dragons\") and priapulids (\"penis worms\"). Their central nervous systems, which include the brain and ventral nerve cord, have long intrigued scientists seeking to understand the evolutionary relationships between these groups.\n\nFor example, priapulids exhibit a single ventral nerve cord, while loriciferans and kinorhynchs have paired nerve cords, with kinorhynchs also developing paired ganglia. Did the ancestral ecdysozoan have a single or paired ventral nerve cord?\n\nFurthermore, while loriciferans and kinorhynchs share a similar nervous system design to arthropods, they are phylogenetically distant. Are these similarities the result of convergent evolution, or do they reflect a shared evolutionary origin?\n\nScalidophorans, which include priapulids, loriciferans, and kinorhynchs, first appeared in the early Cambrian. They represent a crucial lineage for investigating the evolutionary trajectory of the ventral nerve cord in ecdysozoans.\n\nBy studying fossils from the Fortunian Kuanchuanpu Formation (e.g., Eopriapulites and Eokinorhynchus), the Chengjiang Biota (e.g., Xiaoheiqingella and Mafangscolex), and the Wuliuan Ottoia prolifica, the researchers identified elongate structures running along the ventral side of these ancient organisms.\n\n\"These structures closely resemble the ventral nerve cords seen in modern priapulids,\" explained Dr. Deng Wang and Dr. Jean Vannier. Their analysis indicates that these fossils preserve impressions of single ventral nerve cords, shedding light on the likely ancestral condition for scalidophorans.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that a single ventral nerve cord was the ancestral condition for scalidophorans. Moreover, the evolutionary grouping of nematoids and panarthropods (a clade that includes arthropods, tardigrades, and onychophorans) suggests their common ancestor also likely had a single nerve cord.\n\n\"This leads us to propose that the common ancestor of all ecdysozoans possessed a single ventral nerve cord,\" said Dr. Chema Martin-Dur\u00e1n. \"The paired nerve cords observed in arthropods, loriciferans, and kinorhynchs likely evolved independently, representing derived traits.\"\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. Sign up for our free newsletter and get updates on breakthroughs, innovations, and research that matter\u2014daily or weekly.\n\nThe study also highlights a connection between the evolution of paired ventral nerve cords, ganglia, and body segmentation. Loriciferans, kinorhynchs, and panarthropods exhibit varying degrees of body segmentation, suggesting that these structural changes may have co-evolved with nervous system modifications.\n\nDr. Mar\u00eda Herranz noted, \"The emergence of paired nerve cords likely facilitated greater coordination of movement, particularly in segmented animals. During the Precambrian-Cambrian transition, changes in the nervous and muscular systems were likely tied to the development of appendages, enabling more complex locomotion.\"\n\nThis discovery enriches our understanding of ecdysozoan evolution and underscores the role of the fossil record in addressing key questions about early animal development.\n\nBy linking nervous system structures to broader evolutionary trends, the study provides a clearer picture of how the diverse ecdysozoan lineages arose and adapted to their environments.\n\nMore information: Deng Wang, Preservation and early evolution of scalidophoran ventral nerve cord, Science Advances (2025).

            "article_content": "Battery enthusiasts should be ready to dig deep into their chemistry books for a full view of the latest findings coming out of the Tokyo University of Science.\n\nWhile the complicated research hasn't produced a fully working battery, it could provide game-changing insight into the creation of a key power pack part: the negative electrode. Eventually, the analysis may help to produce a better electric vehicle pack with a precise electrode analysis method, all according to a report published by EurekAlert.\n\nWhen lithium-ion batteries cycle, ions move between two electrodes \u2014 the anode and the cathode \u2014 through a substance called electrolyte. The team is interested in finding a better alternative to commonly used carbon negative electrodes, or cathodes. Carbon is subject to troublesome dendrite formation when quickly charged, which in turn can cause a short circuit and fire, as described by the lab summary and ScienceDirect.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile rare, lithium-ion battery fires can be catastrophic.\n\nIn response, the Japanese experts investigated transition metal oxides as an alternative to carbon. The oxide-based materials have great thermal stability and other attributes that promote better fire safety. A promising type is called Wadsley-Roth phase oxides, including TiNb2O7, or TNO, all per EurekAlert.\n\n\"The network structure of TNO forms lithium-ion conduction pathways and has a significant influence on the properties of negative electrodes,\" research team lead and associate professor Naoto Kitamura said in the report.\n\nBut the material's atomic structure needed to be charted. To accomplish the task, the team analyzed three unique samples. One was pristine, one was ball-milled to reduce its particle size, and one was heat-treated, according to the lab notes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA series of advanced tests, including topological analysis, revealed that ball milling followed by heat treatment produced the best results for charge-discharge performance, the report continued.\n\n\"For the first time, we could prove that the combination of intermediate-range structure and topology analyses is a promising way of developing a guideline for improving electrode properties,\" Kitamura said, per EurekAlert.\n\nIf you were going to purchase an EV, which of these factors would be most important to you?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nBattery innovations are happening around the world, including tech that revives Thomas Edison-era iron-alkaline science and promising solid-state power packs. Often, the goal is to increase EV range, charge speeds, and safety while lowering costs.\n\nThat's important, because each EV that replaces a gas-burning car prevents thousands of pounds of harmful, heat-trapping exhaust annually, as noted by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurbing the fumes is a goal drivers of all vehicles can help to achieve. Efficient driving habits can stack up to more than a hundred bucks in savings a year via shorter routes and less idling time. Reducing planet-warming fume production is also a lung-friendly move, as medical experts have linked the gases to a range of health risks, including carcinogen exposure.\n\nFor now, the researchers are confident that their findings will lead to better-performing lithium-ion batteries, which would be a boon to EVs and other tech.\n\n\"TNO can be used in lithium-ion batteries for cars and can contribute to the green growth strategy for achieving carbon neutrality,\" Kitamura said.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "article_content": "Elon Musk enjoys being at the center of the universe, and so if generative AI is going to be as transformational as Silicon Valley believes, he cannot lose. Especially not to a company he helped create. To that end, Musk continues throwing more spaghetti at the wall in his attempt to slow down OpenAI, the company he co-founded in 2015 and that Musk now competes against with his own rival startup xAI.\n\nAccording to a report in the Financial Times, lawyers for Musk have contacted attorneys-general in Delaware and California to demand that a large stake in OpenAI be sold off in an open auction process. Musk has not had a good relationship with the courts in Delaware, hence the interest in moving proceedings to California where OpenAI is headquartered.\n\nThe details are complicated, but essentially, OpenAI has been working towards transitioning from a non-profit into a for-profit entity. Under the new structure, a non-profit subsidiary would remain inside OpenAI that would hold a stake in the for-profit company and continue working on philanthropic endeavors in areas like healthcare and education. Having put initial capital into OpenAI when it was founded as a non-profit, Musk seems to be arguing it would be in the best interest of the non-profit entity to sell at least some of its stake to the highest bidder and use the capital for philanthropic purposes. It would, of course, also give him an opportunity to get involved in and have influence over OpenAI again.\n\nThis latest salvo is one of several in Musk\u2019s attempts to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a for-profit altogether. Through a series of lawsuits, Musk has made a few arguments to try and blunt OpenAI, including that he was deceived into investing in the company under the impression that it would always remain a non-profit with the purpose of developing AI safely and making it available freely for anyone to use. He has for a long time now used the term \u201cClosedAI\u201d to ridicule the company and allege that on the contrary it has kept its technology closed off to itself.\n\nAnother reason he has argued in court that OpenAI should not be allowed to convert into a for-profit is because doing so would mean it was able to grow into the giant it is today without paying any taxes for years, giving it an unfair advantage over for-profit startups like his own.\n\nMusk left OpenAI\u2019s board in 2018 over disagreements about its strategy, and seemingly out of spite, founded xAI in 2023. It is not hard to see how OpenAI\u2019s sudden rise with the launch of ChatGPT may have embittered him. The best analogy might be like discovering the nerdy girl you rejected in high school had a massive glow up years later.\n\nMusk is not the most sympathetic character, particularly given his company is competing directly with OpenAI. But OpenAI is not exactly worth defending either. After receiving tens of billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft and others, launching commercial products with subscription fees, and keeping much of its technology to itself rather than going the open source route, few have truly believed that OpenAI was honoring the intention and purpose of the non-profit model. Meta, which does actually open-source its models, and several other parties including a non-profit focused on AI safety have joined in on Musk\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nIf OpenAI were forced to remain a non-profit, as Musk hopes, the company would have a hard time raising more funding needed to compete in the AI race (most investors want a clear path to realizing a return). Musk\u2019s xAI has been racing to catch up with billions of dollars raised that has been used to scale up a massive supercomputer cluster for model training, and because Musk owns X, formerly Twitter, he has been able to integrate xAI\u2019s chatbot deeply with the social network.\n\nMusk is set to be one of the most influential people in the incoming Trump administration, where he could potentially cause OpenAI headaches through investigations or simply by thwarting its influence on legislation. On top of that, OpenAI is facing other headwinds. Among them, Microsoft, its biggest backer, has been distancing itself and building up its own AI models; OpenAI continues to be embroiled in legal battles with media companies including the New York Times over allegations it has participated in massive copyright infringement through its model training; and CEO Sam Altman was personally sued this week by his own sister over allegations he sexually abused her as a child."

Musk\u2019s camp simply \u201cwant more chaos,\u201d they added.\n\nThe highly unusual effort follows lawsuits launched by Musk in the past year over the attempt by OpenAI, which was founded as a nonprofit dedicated to ensuring AI benefits humanity, to restructure as a for-profit company.\n\nMusk co-founded OpenAI with Altman and nine others in 2015, and was the most significant early funder before leaving the board in 2018 after clashing with Altman.\n\nOpenAI launched a for-profit subsidiary a year later in order to raise outside capital, including more than $13 billion so far from its biggest backer, Microsoft. However, the nonprofit entity, along with employees and investors, currently owns that for-profit subsidiary.\n\nOpenAI is attempting to become a public benefit corporation, a type of for-profit entity committed to bettering society.

            "article_content": "Open-source software is common throughout the tech world, and tools like software composition analysis can spot dependencies and secure them. However, working with open source presents security challenges compared with proprietary software.\n\nChris Hughes, chief security advisor at open-source software security startup Endor Labs, spoke to TechRepublic about the state of open-source software security today and where it might go in the next year.\n\n\u201cOrganizations are starting to try to get some foundational things like governance in place to understand what we are using in terms of open source,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWhere does it reside in our enterprise? What applications are running it?\u201d\n\nOpen source security trends for 2025\n\nFor his work, Hughes defined open source as software for which source code is freely available and can be used to build other projects, possibly with some restrictions. Last year, Harvard Business School found organizations would need to invest $8.8 trillion in technology and labor time to recreate the software used in business if open-source software wasn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cThe estimates are 70-90% of all applications have open source, and roughly 90% of those code bases are entirely made up of open source,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nFor 2025, Hughes predicts:\n\nWidespread open-source software adoption will be accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks on OSS by malicious actors.\n\nOrganizations will continue to put foundational OSS governance in place.\n\nMore companies will use open-source and commercial tools to help them start to understand their OSS consumption.\n\nOrganizations will perform risk-informed consumption of OSS.\n\nEnterprises will continue to push for vendor transparency regarding what OSS they use in their products. However, no widespread mandates will arise for this process.\n\nAI will continue to impact application security and open source in various ways, including organizations using AI to analyze code and remediate issues.\n\nAttackers will target widely used OSS AI libraries, projects, models, and more to launch supply chain attacks on the OSS AI community and commercial vendors.\n\nAI code governance, where organizations have more visibility into AI models, will become more common.\n\nOrganizations increasingly want to know how secure their open source software is, including \u201chow well is it maintained, who\u2019s maintaining it and how quickly do they address vulnerabilities when they occur,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nHe highlighted the attack in April 2024 in which a string of social engineering attempts threatened open-source utilities, particularly opening a backdoor in the XZ Utils utility.\n\n\u201cThat one was really kind of sinister because the open source ecosystem is largely sustained by unpaid volunteers, folks doing this in their free time \u2026 and often not compensated, unpaid, etc.,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo, taking advantage of that and preying on that was a pretty nefarious thing that got a lot of people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nHow is AI changing open-source security?\n\nIn October 2024, the Open Source Initiative established a definition for open-source AI. According to the initiative, open-source AI has four key elements: the freedom to use, study, modify, and share the system for any purpose.\n\nHughes said that defining open-source AI was important because of the rise of distribution platforms like Hugging Face.\n\n\u201cThese AI models, especially the open source ones, are widely used by many organizations and individuals around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to asking: What exactly is in this, and who contributed to it, and where is it f\n\nrom? And are there vulnerable components?\u201d\n\nHughes said that large corporations may have a better chance of talking transparently with their vendors about the entirety of their software supply chain than small companies. Therefore, the problem of not having visibility into the AI models used in their software can grow exponentially for smaller companies.\n\nSEE: Smart home device makers will soon be able to apply for a U.S. government seal of security approval.\n\nCISA encourages open-source software development security\n\nIn March 2024, CISA finalized the secure software development self-attestation form, meant for developers of software used by the U.S. federal government to confirm they use secure development practices.\n\nFederal agencies may ask for other forms and attestations as well. On the commercial side, organizations may build similar requirements into their procurement processes. There is still an element of trust involved since the organization needs to trust the vendor will keep to their word. But the conversation is happening more often now than it did last year, in the wake of attacks on open source utilities, Hughes said.\n\nSolutions for the future of open source software security\n\nPerforming software composition analysis isn\u2019t enough going into 2025, Hughes said. IT professionals and security professionals should know that as software becomes more complex, the number of vulnerabilities has grown \u201cto where it\u2019s becoming a tax on developers to even navigate what needs to be fixed and what order of priority,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nCompanies like Endor Labs can provide insights on dependencies within open-source code, including indirect or transitive dependencies.\n\n\u201cBeing able to point to things like reachability and exploitability \u2026 could be a big benefit from the compliance perspective too, in terms of the burden on the organization and your development team,\u201d he said."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nTubular incomplete specimens of Eopriapulites sphinx from the early Cambrian Kuanchuanpu Formation, showing their ventral nerve cord. Credit: Science Advances (2025). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adr0896\n\nAn international team of scientists has uncovered a fascinating piece of the evolutionary puzzle: how the ventral nerve cord, a key component of the central nervous system, evolved in ecdysozoan animals, a group that includes insects, nematodes, and priapulid worms.\n\nTheir findings, published in a paper titled \"Preservation and early evolution of scalidophoran ventral nerve cord\" in Science Advances, provide valuable insights into the origins of these structures in the basal Cambrian period.\n\nThe research team, comprising Dr. Deng Wang (Northwest University), Dr. Jean Vannier (Universit\u00e9 de Lyon), Dr. Chema Martin-Dur\u00e1n (Queen Mary University of London), and Dr. Mar\u00eda Herranz (Rey Juan Carlos University), analyzed exceptionally well-preserved fossils from key Cambrian deposits. These fossils include representatives of the early-evolving Scalidophora, a subgroup of Ecdysozoa, offering a rare glimpse into the nervous system architecture of ancient animals.\n\nEcdysozoans include arthropods (such as insects and crabs), nematodes (roundworms), and smaller groups like kinorhynchs (\"mud dragons\") and priapulids (\"penis worms\"). Their central nervous systems, which include the brain and ventral nerve cord, have long intrigued scientists seeking to understand the evolutionary relationships between these groups.\n\nFor example, priapulids exhibit a single ventral nerve cord, while loriciferans and kinorhynchs have paired nerve cords, with kinorhynchs also developing paired ganglia. Did the ancestral ecdysozoan have a single or paired ventral nerve cord?\n\nFurthermore, while loriciferans and kinorhynchs share a similar nervous system design to arthropods, they are phylogenetically distant. Are these similarities the result of convergent evolution, or do they reflect a shared evolutionary origin?\n\nScalidophorans, which include priapulids, loriciferans, and kinorhynchs, first appeared in the early Cambrian. They represent a crucial lineage for investigating the evolutionary trajectory of the ventral nerve cord in ecdysozoans.\n\nBy studying fossils from the Fortunian Kuanchuanpu Formation (e.g., Eopriapulites and Eokinorhynchus), the Chengjiang Biota (e.g., Xiaoheiqingella and Mafangscolex), and the Wuliuan Ottoia prolifica, the researchers identified elongate structures running along the ventral side of these ancient organisms.\n\n\"These structures closely resemble the ventral nerve cords seen in modern priapulids,\" explained Dr. Deng Wang and Dr. Jean Vannier. Their analysis indicates that these fossils preserve impressions of single ventral nerve cords, shedding light on the likely ancestral condition for scalidophorans.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that a single ventral nerve cord was the ancestral condition for scalidophorans. Moreover, the evolutionary grouping of nematoids and panarthropods (a clade that includes arthropods, tardigrades, and onychophorans) suggests their common ancestor also likely had a single nerve cord.\n\n\"This leads us to propose that the common ancestor of all ecdysozoans possessed a single ventral nerve cord,\" said Dr. Chema Martin-Dur\u00e1n. \"The paired nerve cords observed in arthropods, loriciferans, and kinorhynchs likely evolved independently, representing derived traits.\"\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Loriciferans, kinorhynchs, and panarthropods exhibit varying degrees of body segmentation, suggesting that these structural changes may have co-evolved with nervous system modifications.\n\nDr. Mar\u00eda Herranz noted, \"The emergence of paired nerve cords likely facilitated greater coordination of movement, particularly in segmented animals. During the Precambrian-Cambrian transition, changes in the nervous and muscular systems were likely tied to the development of appendages, enabling more complex locomotion.\"\n\nThis discovery enriches our understanding of ecdysozoan evolution and underscores the role of the fossil record in addressing key questions about early animal development.\n\nBy linking nervous system structures to broader evolutionary trends, the study provides a clearer picture of how the diverse ecdysozoan lineages arose and adapted to their environments.\n\nMore information: Deng Wang, Preservation and early evolution of scalidophoran ventral nerve cord, Science Advances (2025).

Eventually, the analysis may help to produce a better electric vehicle pack with a precise electrode analysis method, all according to a report published by EurekAlert.\n\nWhen lithium-ion batteries cycle, ions move between two electrodes \u2014 the anode and the cathode \u2014 through a substance called electrolyte. The team is interested in finding a better alternative to commonly used carbon negative electrodes, or cathodes. Carbon is subject to troublesome dendrite formation when quickly charged, which in turn can cause a short circuit and fire, as described by the lab summary and ScienceDirect.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile rare, lithium-ion battery fires can be catastrophic.\n\nIn response, the Japanese experts investigated transition metal oxides as an alternative to carbon. The oxide-based materials have great thermal stability and other attributes that promote better fire safety. A promising type is called Wadsley-Roth phase oxides, including TiNb2O7, or TNO, all per EurekAlert.\n\n\"The network structure of TNO forms lithium-ion conduction pathways and has a significant influence on the properties of negative electrodes,\" research team lead and associate professor Naoto Kitamura said in the report.\n\nBut the material's atomic structure needed to be charted. To accomplish the task, the team analyzed three unique samples. One was pristine, one was ball-milled to reduce its particle size, and one was heat-treated, according to the lab notes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA series of advanced tests, including topological analysis, revealed that ball milling followed by heat treatment produced the best results for charge-discharge performance, the report continued.\n\n\"For the first time, we could prove that the combination of intermediate-range structure and topology analyses is a promising way of developing a guideline for improving electrode properties,\" Kitamura said, per EurekAlert.\n\nIf you were going to purchase an EV, which of these factors would be most important to you?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind\n\nBattery innovations are happening around the world, including tech that revives Thomas Edison-era iron-alkaline science and promising solid-state power packs. Often, the goal is to increase EV range, charge speeds, and safety while lowering costs.\n\nThat's important, because each EV that replaces a gas-burning car prevents thousands of pounds of harmful, heat-trapping exhaust annually, as noted by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurbing the fumes is a goal drivers of all vehicles can help to achieve. Efficient driving habits can stack up to more than a hundred bucks in savings a year via shorter routes and less idling time. Reducing planet-warming fume production is also a lung-friendly move, as medical experts have linked the gases to a range of health risks, including carcinogen exposure.\n\nFor now, the researchers are confident that their findings will lead to better-performing lithium-ion batteries, which would be a boon to EVs and other tech.\n\n\"TNO can be used in lithium-ion batteries for cars and can contribute to the green growth strategy for achieving carbon neutrality,\" Kitamura said.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

Pricing and availability subject to change.\n\nWe can expect some stunning celestial events in 2025, including the Jan. 13 Wolf Moon and a remarkable planetary parade, where seven planets will align in the night sky, that starts tonight.\n\nA parade of planets occurs when four or more planets appear to line up from our perspective on Earth, though their exact alignment in the solar system is not physically possible.\n\nThe 2025 parade of planets starts on Friday, Jan. 10, peaks on Tuesday, Jan. 21 and will last until Friday, Feb. 21. Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Saturn and Uranus visible to the naked eye. Mercury will briefly join the parade on Jan. 25, though it\u2019s difficult to spot due to its proximity to the sun.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor all the biggest celestial events of 2025, check out our comprehensive astronomical calendar as well as our guide to all the comets coming our way this year.\n\nHere is everything to know about the planet parade.\n\nWhat does the parade of planets mean?\n\nThe parade of planets is an astronomical phenomenon in which several planets appear aligned or grouped in the night sky from Earth's perspective.\n\nAlthough the planets are not physically aligned in space, they form a visually striking configuration along the ecliptic plane, the apparent path of the sun across the sky.\n\nDepending on the number of visible planets, this phenomenon can range from a mini planetary alignment involving three planets to a grand parade showcasing all the solar system's major planets.\n\nHow rare is a planet parade?\n\nThe rarity of a planet parade depends on the number of planets involved and their arrangement. Planet parades can be categorized into different types, according to Star Walk:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMini planet parade (three planets) : This is fairly common, occurring a few times each year.\n\nModerate planet parade (four or five planets) : Happens approximately every 1 to 2 years.\n\nLarge planet parades (six or seven planets) : This is much more rare, occurring roughly every 10 to 20 years.\n\nGrand alignments (all eight planets): True grand alignments involving all eight planets are extremely rare, occurring once every 100 to 200 years or more.\n\nWhen was the last time all the planets aligned?\n\nThe last time all eight planets aligned was on Dec. 28, 2022, according to Sky and Telescope.org.\n\nA six-planet parade of planets occurred in June 2024.\n\nWhen can you see the parade of planets?\n\nThe parade of planets will begin to take shape on Friday, Jan. 10, as the planets gradually start aligning in the night sky, according to the Farmers' Almanac.\n\nThe alignment will peak on Jan. 21, when Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Saturn and Uranus will be visible together. The planets will remain visible through the end of February, with the best viewing conditions happening just after sunset.\n\nWhat will the planet align in 2025?\n\nIn 2025, six planets will be in alignment: Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune and Saturn, according to Live Science.com.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOn Jan. 25, Mercury will briefly join the planetary parade, creating a rare lineup of all seven planets visible from Earth. However, spotting Mercury will be challenging due to its small size and proximity to the sun, where its glare hides it from the naked eye.\n\nWhere will the Planet Parade be visible?\n\nMost, if not all, locations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico should be able to see the planetary parade. In Arizona, look toward the southwestern horizon just after sunset.\n\nCan you see the planet parade without a telescope?\n\nYou can see a good deal of the planet parade without a telescope, but visibility depends on the darkness of your location and each planet's brightness.\n\nVenus, Jupiter, Mars and Saturn are bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. Mercury, Uranus and Neptune require a telescope or strong binoculars because they are much dimmer.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor the best viewing, find a dark sky location with minimal light pollution and a clear horizon view.\n\nGot a story you want to share?

            "article_content": "If you\u2019re a procurement specialist looking for software to run a new car\u2019s park assist, voice commands, or chassis controls, there\u2019s now an app store for that. SDVerse, a vehicle software marketplace for automakers and suppliers, launched this past September and is already changing how the code in cars is sold and bought.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a procurement specialist, you might be wondering, \u201cSo what?\u201d It likely won\u2019t be obvious to car buyers, but success for SDVerse could eventually lead to vehicles with better and more sophisticated software than today\u2019s status quo. By helping automakers and suppliers find the right software faster, SDVerse aims to shorten the time it takes to get a new model on the road. That should help automakers reduce their development costs while also shrinking the gulf between the tech in consumer electronics and what\u2019s in a brand-new car.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of software that gets sourced in a not very efficient manner,\u201d SDVerse CEO Prashant Gulati told MotorTrend at CES 2025. \u201cWe estimate that $100 billion of software was purchased in the last three years and the annual spending is going to double in the next seven years. But consumers are not going to pay double what they\u2019re paying for cars today. Where is that money going to come from? That\u2019s the work we\u2019re trying to help the industry with.\u201d\n\nPurchasing managers have traditionally relied on trade conferences, direct outreach to suppliers, and Google searches to find the software they need, and the procurement process typically starts with a request for quotes that can take up to six months just to determine what\u2019s available that meets the buyer\u2019s criteria. Even with that drawn out process, automakers sometimes don\u2019t end up with the best software for their needs. Gulati says he\u2019s heard from GM that the automaker has already used the platform to connect with a supplier that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been on its radar.\n\nGM is one of three founding members, along with suppliers Magna and Wipro, that provided the financial backing to launch SDVerse. Sixteen companies are currently signed up to sell and/or buy on the platform, including Renault Group, FEV, Valeo, Cummins, Forvia, TTTech Auto, NXP, and Bosch Engineering.\n\nLess than four months after launching, the marketplace has grown from an initial 160 software products to 200 across four categories: onboard (software that runs inside the vehicle), offboard (cloud- and mobile-based software), tools (software used to develop other software) and services (hiring another company to develop software). SDVerse simplifies the discovery and matchmaking processes by collecting information on up to 200 attributes for each product and presenting it in a way that allows easy comparison. The company is also developing an AI-powered chatbot to help users conduct research. Buyers can use the marketplace to message sellers or put out requests for information, but pricing and final purchasing agreements are handled outside of the SDVerse platform.\n\nGulati says SDVerse will be successful if it empowers buyers to find the best software and helps sellers make deals faster. That may not sound like a big deal to the average MotorTrend reader, but by speeding up the corporate-industrial machine that makes the machines we love, SDVerse might just modernize the auto industry and the cars it builds."

            "article_content": "Open-source software is common throughout the tech world, and tools like software composition analysis can spot dependencies and secure them. However, working with open source presents security challenges compared with proprietary software.\n\nChris Hughes, chief security advisor at open-source software security startup Endor Labs, spoke to TechRepublic about the state of open-source software security today and where it might go in the next year.\n\n\u201cOrganizations are starting to try to get some foundational things like governance in place to understand what we are using in terms of open source,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWhere does it reside in our enterprise? What applications are running it?\u201d\n\nOpen source security trends for 2025\n\nFor his work, Hughes defined open source as software for which source code is freely available and can be used to build other projects, possibly with some restrictions. Last year, Harvard Business School found organizations would need to invest $8.8 trillion in technology and labor time to recreate the software used in business if open-source software wasn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cThe estimates are 70-90% of all applications have open source, and roughly 90% of those code bases are entirely made up of open source,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nFor 2025, Hughes predicts:\n\nWidespread open-source software adoption will be accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks on OSS by malicious actors.\n\nOrganizations will continue to put foundational OSS governance in place.\n\nMore companies will use open-source and commercial tools to help them start to understand their OSS consumption.\n\nOrganizations will perform risk-informed consumption of OSS.\n\nEnterprises will continue to push for vendor transparency regarding what OSS they use in their products. However, no widespread mandates will arise for this process.\n\nAI will continue to impact application security and open source in various ways, including organizations using AI to analyze code and remediate issues.\n\nAttackers will target widely used OSS AI libraries, projects, models, and more to launch supply chain attacks on the OSS AI community and commercial vendors.\n\nAI code governance, where organizations have more visibility into AI models, will become more common.\n\nOrganizations increasingly want to know how secure their open source software is, including \u201chow well is it maintained, who\u2019s maintaining it and how quickly do they address vulnerabilities when they occur,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nHe highlighted the attack in April 2024 in which a string of social engineering attempts threatened open-source utilities, particularly opening a backdoor in the XZ Utils utility.\n\n\u201cThat one was really kind of sinister because the open source ecosystem is largely sustained by unpaid volunteers, folks doing this in their free time \u2026 and often not compensated, unpaid, etc.,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cSo, taking advantage of that and preying on that was a pretty nefarious thing that got a lot of people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nHow is AI changing open-source security?\n\nIn October 2024, the Open Source Initiative established a definition for open-source AI. According to the initiative, open-source AI has four key elements: the freedom to use, study, modify, and share the system for any purpose.\n\nHughes said that defining open-source AI was important because of the rise of distribution platforms like Hugging Face.\n\n\u201cThese AI models, especially the open source ones, are widely used by many organizations and individuals around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to asking: What exactly is in this, and who contributed to it, and where is it f\n\nrom? And are there vulnerable components?\u201d\n\nHughes said that large corporations may have a better chance of talking transparently with their vendors about the entirety of their software supply chain than small companies. Therefore, the problem of not having visibility into the AI models used in their software can grow exponentially for smaller companies.\n\nSEE: Smart home device makers will soon be able to apply for a U.S. government seal of security approval.\n\nCISA encourages open-source software development security\n\nIn March 2024, CISA finalized the secure software development self-attestation form, meant for developers of software used by the U.S. federal government to confirm they use secure development practices.\n\nFederal agencies may ask for other forms and attestations as well. On the commercial side, organizations may build similar requirements into their procurement processes. There is still an element of trust involved since the organization needs to trust the vendor will keep to their word. But the conversation is happening more often now than it did last year, in the wake of attacks on open source utilities, Hughes said.\n\nSolutions for the future of open source software security\n\nPerforming software composition analysis isn\u2019t enough going into 2025, Hughes said. IT professionals and security professionals should know that as software becomes more complex, the number of vulnerabilities has grown \u201cto where it\u2019s becoming a tax on developers to even navigate what needs to be fixed and what order of priority,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nCompanies like Endor Labs can provide insights on dependencies within open-source code, including indirect or transitive dependencies.\n\n\u201cBeing able to point to things like reachability and exploitability \u2026 could be a big benefit from the compliance perspective too, in terms of the burden on the organization and your development team,\u201d he said."

Image Credit: Komsan Loonprom/Shutterstock.com\n\nMany cancer trial results don\u2019t generalize well to real-world patients. A research team explored this issue with TrialTranslator, a machine-learning framework that systematically tests cancer RCT findings for generalizability. Findings published in Nature Medicine.\n\nPoor generalizability of RCT results\n\nRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for evaluating cancer therapies. However, their findings often fail to translate to real-world settings, leaving patients, physicians, and drug regulators concerned about the limited generalizability of these results.\n\nIn oncology, real-world survival times and treatment benefits are often significantly lower than those reported in RCTs, with median overall survival (mOS) sometimes reduced by as much as six months. Newer anti-cancer agents, such as checkpoint inhibitors, also underperform when applied to the diverse patient populations seen outside clinical trials.\n\nReasons for the difference\n\nA key reason for this gap is the restrictive eligibility criteria often used in RCTs, which create study populations that do not reflect the diversity of real-world patients. Trial participants are often younger, healthier, and less likely to have comorbidities.\n\nUnofficial biases, such as preferential selection based on race or socioeconomic status, may also influence recruitment. These limitations fail to account for the heterogeneity of real-world patients, whose outcomes can vary widely even with identical treatment protocols.\n\nThe current study sought to address this issue by improving the prediction of real-world outcomes for cancer treatments evaluated in phase 3 RCTs. To do this, researchers developed TrialTranslator, a machine-learning (ML) framework designed to assess the generalizability of RCT results systematically.\n\nBy leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) and advanced ML algorithms, the framework identifies patterns and phenotypes that may influence treatment outcomes, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of survival benefits across diverse patient groups.\n\nAbout the study\n\nUsing a comprehensive nationwide EHR database from Flatiron Health, researchers applied TrialTranslator to evaluate 11 landmark RCTs. These trials covered four of the most common advanced solid cancers\u2014metastatic breast cancer (mBC), metastatic prostate cancer (mPC), metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), and advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC).\n\nEach RCT was emulated by identifying real-world patients with matching cancer types, biomarker profiles, and treatment regimens.\n\nPatients were stratified into three prognostic phenotypes (low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk) based on their mortality risk scores derived from ML models. The framework then assessed survival outcomes, including mOS and restricted mean survival time (RMST), to compare treatment effects across these phenotypes with the results reported in the original RCTs.\n\nKey Findings: A Risk-Dependent Gap in Outcomes\n\nThe study revealed a striking disparity between RCT findings and real-world outcomes:\n\nLow- and Medium-Risk Patients: These phenotypes demonstrated survival times and treatment benefits that closely aligned with the RCT results. For instance, low-risk patients often experienced survival benefits similar to those reported in clinical trials, with only a minor reduction in mOS (approximately two months).\n\nHigh-Risk Patients: In contrast, high-risk phenotypes showed significantly worse outcomes. Survival benefits were markedly reduced\u201462% lower than RCT estimates\u2014and often fell outside the 95% confidence intervals reported in the original trials. Seven of the eleven emulated trials failed to show a clinically meaningful survival improvement (greater than three months) for high-risk patients.\n\nOverall, emulated trials consistently estimated survival outcomes that were, on average, 35% lower than those reported in the RCTs. This disparity highlights the challenges of translating trial findings to more heterogeneous real-world populations.\n\nRobust Validation of Results\n\nThe robustness of these findings was confirmed through extensive validation. Subgroup analyses, semi-synthetic data simulations, and alternative eligibility criteria demonstrated consistent results, reinforcing the reliability of TrialTranslator. Sensitivity analyses also showed that stricter eligibility criteria had little impact on the observed disparities, suggesting that patient prognosis, rather than inclusion criteria, plays a more critical role in determining treatment outcomes.\n\nImplications for Oncology\n\nThese findings underscore the need for a paradigm shift in clinical trial design and interpretation. Current RCTs often overlook the prognostic heterogeneity of real-world patients, which contributes to their limited generalizability. High-risk patients, in particular, are underserved by existing trials, as their outcomes deviate most significantly from RCT results.\n\nTools like TrialTranslator offer a promising solution. By integrating EHR-derived data with ML-based phenotyping, they can provide personalized predictions of treatment benefits at the individual patient level. This enables more informed clinical decision-making, helping patients and clinicians set realistic expectations for treatment outcomes.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, these tools could revolutionize trial design by prioritizing patient prognosis over traditional eligibility criteria. By stratifying patients based on risk phenotypes, future trials could better represent the full spectrum of cancer patients and provide more accurate estimates of treatment efficacy.\n\nConclusion\n\n\u2018\u2019This study highlights the substantial role that prognostic heterogeneity plays in the limited generalizability of RCT results,\u201d the authors conclude. While low- and medium-risk patients may benefit as expected from cancer therapies, high-risk patients often experience diminished survival gains.\n\nML-based frameworks like TrialTranslator could help bridge this gap, enabling more inclusive trials and better real-world outcomes. With tools like this, oncology can move closer to truly personalized treatment approaches that account for the diverse needs of real-world patients."

            "article_content": "Why the Jobs Report Dashed Hopes for Another Rate Cut If you've been waiting for borrowing costs to fall for credit cards, car loans, or mortgages, your wait just got longer.\n\n\n\nThe economy added far more jobs than expected in December, and that's likely to make officials at the Federal Reserve comfortable holding the central bank's benchmark interest rate higher for longer than they had expected just a few months ago.\n\n\n\nIndeed, a few months ago, economists were discussing how fast the Fed might slash interest rates in 2025. Now they're questioning whether there will be any rate cuts at all. And since the fed funds rate influences interest rates charged for all kinds of loans, that's bad news for borrowers, at least for the time being.\n\n\n\n\"The robust December employment report is another piece of economic data that suggests the Federal Reserve will move to the sidelines for a while; we foresee them keeping rates steady throughout the first half of the year,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, wrote in a commentary.\n\n\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, financial markets were pricing in a 30% chance that 2025 will come and go without any more rate cuts, double the 13% chance the day before the jobs report, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. The tool forecasts rate changes based on fed funds futures trading data Read the full article here. -Diccon Hyatt\n\nWhat Surging Treasury Yields Mean for Your Finances In the last four months, the yield on the 10-year Treasury has increased more than a full percentage point, even as the Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest by the same amount. Treasury yields have been driven higher by signs of strong economic growth, concerns about sticky inflation, and uncertainty about the consequences of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policy proposals. This week, in particular, labor market data has underscored the resilience of the economy, raising concerns that the Fed may not cut rates again. TradingView The last time Treasury yields climbed to around their current levels, in April 2024, consumer interest rates followed suit. The average 30-year mortgage rate rose from 6.8% to 7.2% between early April and early May. Amid a surge in October 2023, when the 10-year yield briefly topped 5%, the average mortgage rate hit a 23-year high of more than 7.6%. When Treasury yields last reached their current levels, they also hit stock portfolios. The S&P 500 pulled back more than 5% in the first three weeks of April 2024, when the 10-year yield advanced more than 40 basis points. And in October 2023, the benchmark index fell into a technical correction as Treasury yields peaked after a monthslong ascent.

Constellation expects the combination to add more than $2 billion in adjusted free cash flow per year and $2 in earnings per share (EPS) beyond 2026. The cash and stock transaction valued at $16.4 billion consists of $4.5 billion in cash alongside 50 million shares of Constellation stock. Constellation will also assume roughly $12.7 billion of Calpine net debt, bringing the net purchase price to $26.6 billion. The companies said the transaction is expected to close within 12 months. The acquisition is set to expand Constellation\u2019s capacity at a time when power demand for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers in the U.S. is expected to triple by 2030, Mizuho Research analysts said last year. The rise in demand for AI applications has driven shares of Constellation and other energy providers like Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) higher over the past year. TradingView Constellation shares were up over 25% in early-afternoon trading. The stock has gained 160% over the past 12 months, far outpacing the S&P 500's performance during the period. -Andrew Kessel\n\nGeopolitical Concerns Push Oil Prices Higher Oil prices rose Friday, touching prices last seen in the fall, as traders digested further U.S. sanctions on Russia. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, recently traded around $80, up nearly 3%, according to several market data sources. That was the contract's highest price since October. Meanwhile, the S&P 500's energy sector was the day\u2019s only gainer of the index's 11, rising about 0.4%. The Treasury Department on Friday announced actions targeting the Russian oil industry, including Russian oil producers Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas and sanctions on \"more than 180 vessels, and dozens of oil traders, oilfield service providers, insurance companies, and energy officials.\" \"We are ratcheting up the sanctions risk associated with Russia's oil trade, including shipping and financial facilitation in support of Russia's oil exports,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. Traders may also be responding to cold weather in parts of the U.S. that could lift demand for oil used for heating.\n\n\n\nGeopolitical issues\u2014including sanctions and tariffs\u2014are expected to be a key, if unpredictable, driver of movement in oil prices in 2025, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote Thursday, even as they forecast steady demand growth over the next decade, including from emerging markets. Reduced supply, potentially from Iran, could lift prices this year, UBS analysts wrote Wednesday, while a global economic slowdown could pull them lower. -David Marino-Nachison\n\nInsurance Stocks Fall as LA Wildfire Damage Estimates Rise Shares of insurance companies tumbled on Friday as the deadly wildfires in Southern California that are still burning have already caused billions of dollars in damage. The Travelers Companies (TRV) was down 3.5% in recent trading, leading decliners in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while Allstate (ALL) and Chubb Limited (CB) fell 5% and 3.5%, respectively. The SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE) was down 2.5%. The latest preliminary estimate from weather site AccuWeather is that the blazes, which broke out on Tuesday, have created total damage and economic loss of between $135 billion and $150 billion. AccuWeather noted that as the fires continue to spread, that number could go up, possibly substantially. A home reduced to ashes during the aftermath of the Palisades Fire in California. Michael Nigro / Bloomberg / Getty Images AccuWeather's Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter said \u201cthe devastation left behind is heartbreaking and the economic toll is staggering,\u201d adding that the financial cost might reach nearly 4% of California\u2019s annual gross domestic product (GDP). -Bill McColl\n\nWalgreens Stock Surges on Strong Earnings Report Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) skyrocketed Friday morning after the pharmacy retailer reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results. The company recorded $39.46 billion in revenue for the quarter, well above the $36.71 billion it recorded the same time last year and the $37.33 billion analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Walgreens posted a $265 million net loss, below the small profit analysts expected, but the company's adjusted earnings beat projections. After adjusting for the cost of various one-time charges like store closures and the changing value of some of its investments, Walgreens recorded an adjusted net income of $440 million, or 51 cents per share, well above the $329.34 million and 38 cents per share analysts had expected. In its fourth quarter report, Walgreens announced a plan to close roughly 1,200 \"underperforming\" stores over the next three years, including 500 in this fiscal year. The company did not disclose in Friday's earnings report how many stores it closed in the first quarter. \u201cWhile our turnaround will take time, our early progress reinforces our belief in a sustainable, retail pharmacy-led operating model,\" Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth said Friday. Walgreens shares were up more than 20% early Friday. The stock was the worst performer in the S&P 500 in 2024, with shares hitting their lowest price in decades. -Aaron McDade"

            "article_content": "New AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D gaming CPUs could have been produced with even better specs, but to do so would have made them far too expensive. That\u2019s according to AMD, who stated at CES this week that its new Ryzen 9000X3D series only has a single 3D V-Cache, rather than a long-speculated dual configuration, to keep them cheap enough to make and sell for gamers.\n\nThe inclusion of the 3D V-Cache into Ryzen CPUs has given AMD the edge over Intel in recent years, when it comes to gaming performance, with its flagship models regularly reaching the top of best gaming CPU charts. However, while it makes sense for the likes of the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D to only feature a single 3D V-Cache \u2013 as that chip only has one CPU die \u2013 higher-end models that use two CPU dies could in theory host two cache dies, yet AMD has chosen not to implement this option.\n\nIn an interview with German tech site HardwareLuxx, AMD confirmed that there isn\u2019t a technical limitation that prevents a dual 3D V-Cache being used in Ryzen CPUs. Instead, it\u2019s all down to cost, as it would \u201csimply be too expensive\u201d to produce and sell.\n\nAMD also believes that \u201cgames would not benefit\u201d from having a 3D V-Cache on both chiplets because the potential performance boost is essentially already provided by the single additional 64MB 3D V-Cache die. There would be a benefit in some situations but not enough that the extra cost of manufacturer and to customers would be worthwhile.\n\nAccording to HardwareLuxx\u2019s report, AMD has \u201crepeatedly considered\u201d producing Ryzen X3D CPUs with 3D V-Cache on both chiplets, but continually come to the conclusion that production and likely retail cost wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\n\nWhile AMD has tweaked the layout of recent X3D chips to improve thermal performance, it looks like a Ryzen X3D CPU launch with two larger caches isn\u2019t going to be in the pipeline, at least for now.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean these CPUs are likely to underperform, however. During the 9900X3D announcement at CES this week, AMD suggested that the new CPUs will continue to outpace Intel, with the 9950X3D set to be 20% faster than the Intel Core Ultra 285K and within 1% of the performance of the 9800X3D in games. We\u2019ll have to wait until these new X3D CPUs launch, sometime in Q1 2025, before we can test that theory out for ourselves.\n\nIn the meantime, check out our AMD Ryzen 9800X3D review to see just how well these X3D CPUs perform in the real world, with the 9800X3D offering the best performance for gaming that you can find right now."

Unlike conventional systems that rely on isolated data models, EKGs unify fragmented data, facilitating more flexible, dynamic and natural language-driven interactions.\n\nThis shift is essential to meet the growing demands of internet of things (IoT), augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR), and hybrid cloud-edge environments, Prof. Reddy said"

(Peter Kramer/Getty Images)\n\nBut when an autopsy was done following Williams\u2019 death, it revealed he was actually suffering from undiagnosed Lewy body dementia (LBD) that was progressively causing his Parkinson's-type symptoms.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe NHS explains this is one of the most common types of dementia and that those with it may experience; hallucinations and hearing voices; problems with understanding, thinking, memory and judgement; confusion or sleepiness; slow movement, stiff limbs and tremors; disturbed sleep; fainting spells, unsteadiness and falls; depression and anxiety.\n\nThere is currently no cure for LBD or treatment that will slow it down but there are treatments to help control some symptoms. It is said the average survival time after a diagnosis is about five to seven years but that\u2019s highly variable.\n\nIn 2021, Williams\u2019 son Zak spoke out about the disease and his dad\u2019s misdiagnosis which left him \u2018very uncomfortable\u2019 and \u2018frustrated\u2019 in his final years.\n\nRobin and Zak Williams.

Its rule began when the Emperor Constantine split the Roman Empire into a western and eastern half.\n\nThe eastern half remained the dominant power in ancient Europe throughout the rest of late antiquity and even during parts of the middle ages, eventually coming to be known as the Byzantine Empire.\n\nIts capital, Constantinople, was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, thus marking the end of the Empire's more than 1,000-year reign.\n\nWhile the recently excavated settlement was still active during the Byzantine period, it expanded significantly, the researchers concluded.\n\nThis growth included the construction of the monastery and the winepress.\n\nThe researchers also uncovered a 'very sophisticated' winepress, which made wine that was sent throughout the country and to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea\n\nLike the monastery, the winepress also features mosaic flooring in the fermentation rooms and the collecting vat, made of blue and white stones\n\nThe researchers also uncovered numerous artifacts from the site, including 'good quality toys that show status'\n\nLike the monastery, the winepress also features mosaic flooring in the fermentation rooms and the collecting vat, made of blue and white stones.\n\nThe researchers described this winepress as 'very sophisticated,' adding that its construction and development likely involved 'significant financial resources, time and a range of professional work and effort.'\n\nIt produced wine that was sent both throughout the country and to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea, they said.\n\nThe dig also uncovered ample evidence of local pottery production, such as detritus left behind by a ceramic factory, garbage pits, discarded vessels that were misshaped during production, and even a number of vessels that are 'unique to this site.'\n\n'The discovery of the site highlights the historical richness of Kiryat Gat and its surroundings, shedding light on the centrality of the region in antiquity,' said Svetlana Talis, Director of the Southern Region at the Israel Antiquities Authority."

Credit: Science Advances (2025). DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adr0896\n\nAn international team of scientists has uncovered a fascinating piece of the evolutionary puzzle: how the ventral nerve cord, a key component of the central nervous system, evolved in ecdysozoan animals, a group that includes insects, nematodes, and priapulid worms.\n\nTheir findings, published in a paper titled \"Preservation and early evolution of scalidophoran ventral nerve cord\" in Science Advances, provide valuable insights into the origins of these structures in the basal Cambrian period.\n\nThe research team, comprising Dr. Deng Wang (Northwest University), Dr. Jean Vannier (Universit\u00e9 de Lyon), Dr. Chema Martin-Dur\u00e1n (Queen Mary University of London), and Dr. Mar\u00eda Herranz (Rey Juan Carlos University), analyzed exceptionally well-preserved fossils from key Cambrian deposits. These fossils include representatives of the early-evolving Scalidophora, a subgroup of Ecdysozoa, offering a rare glimpse into the nervous system architecture of ancient animals.\n\nEcdysozoans include arthropods (such as insects and crabs), nematodes (roundworms), and smaller groups like kinorhynchs (\"mud dragons\") and priapulids (\"penis worms\"). Their central nervous systems, which include the brain and ventral nerve cord, have long intrigued scientists seeking to understand the evolutionary relationships between these groups.\n\nFor example, priapulids exhibit a single ventral nerve cord, while loriciferans and kinorhynchs have paired nerve cords, with kinorhynchs also developing paired ganglia. Did the ancestral ecdysozoan have a single or paired ventral nerve cord?\n\nFurthermore, while loriciferans and kinorhynchs share a similar nervous system design to arthropods, they are phylogenetically distant. Are these similarities the result of convergent evolution, or do they reflect a shared evolutionary origin?\n\nScalidophorans, which include priapulids, loriciferans, and kinorhynchs, first appeared in the early Cambrian. They represent a crucial lineage for investigating the evolutionary trajectory of the ventral nerve cord in ecdysozoans.\n\nBy studying fossils from the Fortunian Kuanchuanpu Formation (e.g., Eopriapulites and Eokinorhynchus), the Chengjiang Biota (e.g., Xiaoheiqingella and Mafangscolex), and the Wuliuan Ottoia prolifica, the researchers identified elongate structures running along the ventral side of these ancient organisms.\n\n\"These structures closely resemble the ventral nerve cords seen in modern priapulids,\" explained Dr. Deng Wang and Dr. Jean Vannier. Their analysis indicates that these fossils preserve impressions of single ventral nerve cords, shedding light on the likely ancestral condition for scalidophorans.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that a single ventral nerve cord was the ancestral condition for scalidophorans. Moreover, the evolutionary grouping of nematoids and panarthropods (a clade that includes arthropods, tardigrades, and onychophorans) suggests their common ancestor also likely had a single nerve cord.\n\n\"This leads us to propose that the common ancestor of all ecdysozoans possessed a single ventral nerve cord,\" said Dr. Chema Martin-Dur\u00e1n. \"The paired nerve cords observed in arthropods, loriciferans, and kinorhynchs likely evolved independently, representing derived traits.\"\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Loriciferans, kinorhynchs, and panarthropods exhibit varying degrees of body segmentation, suggesting that these structural changes may have co-evolved with nervous system modifications.\n\nDr. Mar\u00eda Herranz noted, \"The emergence of paired nerve cords likely facilitated greater coordination of movement, particularly in segmented animals. During the Precambrian-Cambrian transition, changes in the nervous and muscular systems were likely tied to the development of appendages, enabling more complex locomotion.\"\n\nThis discovery enriches our understanding of ecdysozoan evolution and underscores the role of the fossil record in addressing key questions about early animal development.\n\nBy linking nervous system structures to broader evolutionary trends, the study provides a clearer picture of how the diverse ecdysozoan lineages arose and adapted to their environments.\n\nMore information: Deng Wang, Preservation and early evolution of scalidophoran ventral nerve cord, Science Advances (2025).

            "article_content": "The renowned physicist Richard Feynman is reputed to have once said that \u201cphysics is to math what sex is to masturbation\u201d. Exactly what comparison he was making, he didn\u2019t clarify \u2013 but if the orgasm gap is anything to go by, he presumably meant that math is often more fun, more effective, and better at getting the desired result in the face of adverse real-world conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor example: physics traditionally tells us that all particles can be classified into one of two types, either bosons or fermions, depending on their properties and behavior. But math says that\u2019s not the whole story \u2013 at least, according to a new study.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWe determined that new types of particles we never knew of before are possible,\u201d said Kaden Hazzard, associate professor of physics and astronomy at Rice University and co-author of the new paper, in a statement on the findings.\n\nIt\u2019s actually not the first time the existence of such \u201cparastatistical particles\u201d, or \u201cparaparticles\u201d as they\u2019re known for short, has been suggested. Indeed, \u201cparastatistics, and their apparent absence in nature, has been discussed since the dawn of quantum mechanics,\u201d notes the paper.\n\n\u201cThe first concrete theory of parastatistics was proposed and investigated by Green in 1953,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThis theory was subsequently studied in detail and also more generally and rigorously within the framework of algebraic quantum field theory.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, though, the idea turned out to be something of a lame duck. It wasn\u2019t that the paraparticles didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t exist \u2013 that was fine \u2013 rather, the problem was that it didn\u2019t matter whether they did or not.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThese works did not rule out the existence of paraparticles in nature,\u201d explains the paper, \u201cbut led to the conclusion that, under certain assumptions, any theory of paraparticles [\u2026] is physically indistinguishable from theories of ordinary fermions and bosons. This seemingly obviated the need to consider paraparticle theories, as they give exactly the same physical predictions as theories of ordinary particles.\u201d\n\nSo much for the paraparticles idea \u2013 or so it seemed. But when Hazzard and then-grad student Zhiyuan Wang considered the problem through a mathematical lens, they not only found that nontrivial paraparticles could exist, but they also figured out where they might turn up in nature \u2013 such as within magnetic flux.\n\n\u201cParticles aren\u2019t just these fundamental things,\u201d said Hazzard. \u201cThey\u2019re also important in describing materials.\u201d\n\nAs you might expect, these paraparticles would be weird \u2013 even considering the general oddness of quantum physics. \u201cTheir exchange statistics can be physically observed and are notably distinct from fermions and bosons,\u201d notes the paper.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLike the equally baffling new quasiparticles, the discovery of which was also announced this week, the result \u201cdemonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems,\u201d the authors write, \u201cand \u2013 more speculatively \u2013 the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particle.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s exciting, but it\u2019s only a first step. Where this theory leads, or even possible routes to get there, are still to be determined \u2013 as of yet, we don\u2019t even know the questions, let alone the answers.\n\n\u201cThis is cross-disciplinary research that involves several areas of theoretical physics and mathematics,\u201d said Wang, now a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany. But \u201cto realize paraparticles in experiments, we need more realistic theoretical proposals,\u201d he added.\n\nWherever the theory takes them, though, the journey should be worth watching.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where it will go,\u201d Hazzard said. \u201cBut I know it will be exciting to find out.\u201d\n\nThe paper is published in the journal Nature."

As we strive to reimagine healthcare delivery, we must find ways to sustain, and not undercut, the tremendous momentum of American biomedical science.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealthcare, as experienced in America today, is miserable for just about everyone. It\u2019s awful for patients who must navigate a fiendishly Byzantine system to receive even the most basic care, and to figure out whether costly treatments will be covered by insurance. It\u2019s awful for loved ones who are increasingly pressed into service to advocate for patients\u2014such as when they are left languishing for days in the hall outside emergency departments waiting for a hospital bed to become available.\n\nIt\u2019s awful as well for exasperated and overburdened health care professionals. Doctors like those I trained with face escalating administrative burdens, including constant negotiation with insurance companies; they\u2019re experiencing unprecedented professional dissatisfaction and career burnout. Competing, ever-expanding armies of administrators\u2014and more recently, AI tools\u2014from provider and insurer organizations engage in fierce daily battles over reimbursement. These relentless bureaucratic skirmishes sap time, money, and empathy from everyone involved.\n\nShare\n\nYET WE ARE ALSO LIVING THROUGH a time of remarkable progress in biomedical science, \u201ca Golden Age for medicine\u201d as columnist David Wallace-Wells has called it. Genetics and other tools have provided critical insights into new disease targets to attack. We have added an impressive array of approaches to our therapeutic armamentarium, including traditional small molecules, biologics, nucleic acid therapeutics, cell and gene therapies, and imaginative combinations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsider the remarkable results: We have improved treatments for many cancers, and developed therapies that now afford most children born with cystic fibrosis a good chance to live a nearly-normal life. Hepatitis C infections, which can lead to liver failure as well as liver cancer, can now be cured. An injectable medicine, lenacapavir, was shown to protect recipients from HIV infection for six months with 100 percent efficacy\u2014an accomplishment recognized by Science magazine as the 2024 Breakthrough of the Year. And a powerful new class of medications, the GLP-1 receptor agonists (think Ozempic and Wegovy), has proved phenomenally effective in staunching appetite, helping patients reduce excess weight and meaningfully improve their health.\n\nSupport our independent political and cultural journalism by signing up for a free or paid Bulwark subscription.\n\nBetter measurement technologies, including wearable digital devices, enable researchers to understand both disease and treatments with unprecedented precision. Over coffee in Cambridge, Massachusetts, an enthusiastic physician-scientist recently explained to me how a lightweight headset produced by his startup enables clinicians to monitor brainwaves and assess sleep disorders, attracting the interest of multiple pharmaceutical companies.\n\nLife science is also poised to benefit from the revolution in artificial intelligence; two recipients of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry developed an AI-enabled tool, AlphaFold, to predict protein structures. AI will also play a critically important role in managing drug development\u2019s exploding complexity\u2014a happy consequence of biology\u2019s remarkable progress.\n\nAT THIS TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT in life science, it seems astonishing some would spend our time and treasure looking backwards and relitigating some of medicine\u2019s most impactful and well-established successes, like the vaccinations that eliminated smallpox and saved millions of children from the scourge of dreadful diseases like polio and other preventable conditions. This regressive thinking is at once distracting and terribly misguided.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, we should look forward, and support our nation\u2019s powerful life-science engine, including both the foundational, enabling science so often funded by the National Institutes of Health as well as our vibrant biotech ecosystem that translates promising early-stage science into rigorously validated medicines.\n\nAs we contemplate how to improve access to medicines\u2014a vitally important consideration\u2014let us remember that no one can access therapies that haven\u2019t yet been discovered. Effective treatments are still urgently required for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, pancreatic cancer, brain tumors, and a vast array of rare, devastating conditions that collectively affect millions.\n\nIt is essential that we aggressively challenge our conspicuously dysfunctional model of healthcare delivery, since great biomedical science means very little if it doesn\u2019t translate to better care and improved health. But amid our zeal to fix what\u2019s so obviously broken, we must do our best to preserve, refine, and build upon what\u2019s already working.\n\nShare"
