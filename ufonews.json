        "article_content": "King Charles is known as a man of discerning tastes and strong opinions. He has a long-held interest in alternative beliefs and mystical therapies, and we all know his thoughts on leaky pens.\n\nBut who would have thought His Majesty may also have been a close associate of visitors from another planet and was once spotted at the controls of a UFO?\n\nThat is the bizarre claim being made in a new TV documentary which examines the royals' interest in UFOs and other paranormal mysteries.\n\nKing Of UFOs, made by British musician and UFO buff Mark Christopher Lee and now available on Amazon Prime, asks the question: does the Royal Family know what's really out there?\n\nIn it, he speaks to a diver, Dan Costello, who says he witnessed Charles, then Prince of Wales, at the controls of 'a saucer-shaped craft with dual rotor blades' at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1975.\n\nKing Charles may have been a close associate of visitors from another planet and was once spotted at the controls of a UFO\n\nThe then dashing 27-year-old prince was one of three pilots spotted steering the 'odd-looking' object, while serving as a qualified helicopter pilot with the Royal Navy, he claims.\n\nDescribing the aircraft, he says: 'It would sit and hover in the sky with the blades not on [rotating] with no sound of propulsion, just a faint crackle of electromagnetism.'\n\nWhile, sadly, Costello goes on to admit that the aircraft Charles was allegedly flying was most probably not of alien origin, but part of a secret military operation, involving the British and Canadian governments \u2013 plus it hasn't been confirmed that Charles was anywhere near Canada at the time \u2013 it does bring into focus a royal fascination with all things 'other worldly', that goes back generations.\n\nIndeed, as I can exclusively reveal, the King may well have inherited a keen interest in the subject from his late father, Prince Philip, and his great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, both of whom were avid enthusiasts.\n\nPhilip had a lifelong interest and curiosity in a range of fringe subjects, including UFOs, crop circles and the Loch Ness monster.\n\nMountbatten's fascination, meanwhile, reached its zenith between 1950 and 1959, shortly before his appointment as Chief of Defence Staff, the highest position in the British military. And it prompts Lee, in the documentary, to ask of our new King: 'Does he know the truth? If so, he should release this truth to the public.'\n\nAs an investigative journalist, university lecturer and committed ufologist, I first heard of the active role the royals had played in seeking the answer to the ultimate question \u2013 Are we alone? \u2013 as part of my research back in the early 2000s.\n\nI was able to examine Mountbatten's private papers at the Broadlands Archive, which prove he had a thing for space travel and avidly consumed the early literature on flying saucers, as UFOs were known at that time.\n\nPrince Charles, then Prince of Wales, was seen at the controls of 'a saucer-shaped craft with dual rotor blades' at Sandy Point in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1975\n\nLord Mountbatten and his nephew Prince Philip at the Royal Marines barracks in October 1965\n\nThe term 'flying saucer' was first used in 1947 after pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing a chain of nine objects in the sky while flying over Washington State, describing them as flying at great speed and skipping like a 'saucer on water'.\n\nThe world was gripped and, before long, saucers were being spotted everywhere.\n\nIn 1950, Mountbatten encouraged newspaper editor Charles Eade, who had served as his press secretary during the war in the Far East, to publish 'all the available evidence' in his paper, the Sunday Dispatch.\n\nEade wanted Mountbatten to allow his name to be used in his series as it would add to its credibility \u2013 but Mountbatten refused.\n\nInstead, Eade's front-page splash, under the headline 'Flying saucers... the story that may be bigger than atom bomb wars', was credited to a source whom he described as 'one of the most famous men alive today' who 'commands universal respect and admiration'.\n\nMountbatten's theory was that they were craft from other planets, as his letters to Eade reveal: 'The available evidence shows they are not of human agency, that is to say they do not come from our Earth.\n\n'If that is so, then presumably they must come from some heavenly body, probably a planet. Maybe it is the Shackletons and Scotts of Venus or Mars who are making their first exploration of our Earth.' This interest was shared by Charles and by Prince Philip, who was among the first subscribers to the magazine Flying Saucer Review, launched in London during 1955 and edited by retired RAF pilot Derek Dempster.\n\nAccording to one of its later editors, Gordon Creighton, every copy was sent to Buckingham Palace.\n\nIn 2002 I was invited to tea by Mountbatten's youngest daughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, now 95, at her stately home in Oxfordshire to discuss the subject.\n\nShe told me how her father was fond of asking, 'Do you believe in flying saucers?' as a conversation opener during visits to royal courts and capitals across Europe.\n\nShe described a lunch with the then King Idris of Libya, when her father was Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Mediterranean. 'After the usual pleasantries there was quite a long silence and my father decided to break it by asking [through an interpreter] what for him was the burning question, 'Will you ask his majesty if he believes in flying saucers?'\n\n'There was this frightful pause, as the king thought his leg was being pulled. But when it was established that it was a genuine question, he said that of course he believed in them.\n\n'He said he had seen two of them himself and added that the Prophet recorded how a close companion of his had seen one of the fiery sphere types \u2013 as had his camel.'\n\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Edinburgh's voracious appetite for information on flying saucers was confirmed to me by RAF Air Marshal Sir Peter Horsley, who served as his equerry from 1952 to 1955.\n\nLord Mountbatten with Prince Philip and Charles at a polo match in 1977\n\nWhen I spoke to him in 2001, the year he died, he revealed he'd been tasked by his employer with finding out as much as he could on the subject and was given carte blanche to read any reports and to interview fighter pilots who had reported seeing unusual phenomena in the sky.\n\nHe told me he had arranged, with the duke's personal approval, for RAF Fighter Command to send copies of the latest sightings made by aircrew for examination at Buckingham Palace.\n\nPerhaps the strangest outcome of this inquiry was Peter Horsley's role in inviting several UFO witnesses to discuss their experiences at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThese included the captain of a BOAC airliner, James Howard, who witnessed, along with other crew members and passengers, a strange formation of UFOs while flying over the North Atlantic in June 1954.\n\nAnother visitor to the palace was schoolboy Stephen Darbishire who obtained two photographs of a 'saucer' hovering above the slopes of the Old Man of Coniston in the Lake District, in February of that year.\n\nHorsley explained his reason for inviting UFO witnesses to the palace was partly to 'put them on the spot' and to test their honesty in the presence of royalty \u2013 a method as effective as any truth serum.\n\nThey both passed the test with flying colours, convincing their esteemed hosts \u2013 and Horsley himself \u2013 that Earth had indeed had visitations from outer space.\n\nHorsley was scathing about a growing movement of cranks and fantasists, however, who he thought were making a mockery \u2013 and quite a bit of money \u2013 out of the flying saucer craze.\n\nAmong those Horsley accused of making a joke out of a very serious subject was the notorious Polish-American writer George Adamski, who co-authored the 1953 best-seller Flying Saucers Have Landed with Desmond Leslie, a former Second World War Spitfire pilot who had his own contacts in the British establishment.\n\nLeslie was friends with General Sir Frederick 'Boy' Browning, the husband of author Daphne du Maurier. After retiring from the military, Browning had become head of Princess Elizabeth's staff and, following her accession, worked for Prince Philip.\n\nBrowning was another member of what Horsley described as 'the flying saucer club' at the palace.\n\nAdamski's book contained his personal account of an alleged meeting with the Venusian pilot of a flying saucer 'scout-ship' that landed in the Mojave Desert of California, communicating with its angelic occupant by telepathy.\n\nIn April 1959, Adamski embarked on a European lecture tour that included an audience with the Dutch royal family \u2013 proving they too had caught the alien bug \u2013 and, shortly before he arrived in London, Leslie wrote to the Duke of Edinburgh, enclosing a personal invitation for them to meet Adamski, in secret if necessary.\n\nPrince Philip clearly realised the public relations danger this could place him in as he annotated Leslie's letter \u2013 now preserved in the Imperial War Museum archives \u2013 with the words, 'Not on your Nellie!', adding in a later note: 'He may not be a crank but he's a bit too fanciful for me!'\n\nHowever, despite the royal disapproval, both General Browning and Peter Horsley met Leslie and Adamski during their visit at a private address in London.\n\nHorsley told me he was not impressed by either. He felt that Desmond Leslie was 'probably sincere but gullible, sucked into the saucer cult by people who hoped to profit from it, such as Adamski' and he warned Browning against having any further contact with them.\n\nPeter Horsley's direct knowledge of the duke's interest in UFOs and other strange phenomena ended when he left the palace in 1955 to return to RAF duties. Yet the royal fascination remained.\n\nIn 1978, Lord Mountbatten joined Prince Philip and the Queen at the star-spangled royal premiere of Steven Spielberg's Hollywood blockbuster Close Encounters of the Third Kind at the Odeon in Leicester Square. The film tells the story of government conspiracy to hide the first arrival of UFOs and their friendly alien crews on Earth.\n\nOver the decades the duke had maintained an active interest in a range of esoteric subjects.\n\nDuring the 1960s, he became involved in plans for a full-scale investigation in search of the Loch Ness monster.\n\nA Conservative MP, David James, persuaded him to use his connections with the Royal Navy to push for a publicly funded expedition to Loch Ness. The MoD's Chief of Defence Staff, Sir Solly Zuckerman, raised the idea with the navy's Chief Scientist, Sir John Caroll, arguing that 'if a sonar investigation were to reveal something extraordinary in the loch, it would be of considerable scientific interest'. But Caroll blocked the idea, saying it would be too costly.\n\nRoyal interest in the arcane also extended to the crop circle phenomenon which, some argue, are created by extra-terrestrial life. One of the leading promoters of the mystery, Colin Andrews, sent a copy of his book Circular Evidence, co-written with Pat Delgado, to Queen Elizabeth.\n\nIn August of that year, The Times revealed that the book had been added to the Royal Family's 'holiday reading list'. Shortly afterwards, Andrews received a note from Buckingham Palace asking if he would provide updates 'on the latest developments on the Circles Phenomenon' for the Duke of Edinburgh, who had become a paid subscriber to his Crop Circles newsletter.\n\nBut the royals turned down Andrews' offer to provide a personal briefing on the subject, perhaps having learned lessons from the duke's earlier flirtation with George Adamski and his friends.\n\nNo one has been able to establish the full extent of the Duke of Edinburgh's personal interest in UFOs and other strange phenomena as he never mentioned the subject in media interviews.\n\nHowever, several contributors to the documentary, King Of UFOs, say that the Royal Archives at Windsor Castle include sealed files that are not to be opened until 90 years after his death \u2013 so more may yet be revealed.\n\nIn 2017, I wrote to Prince Philip to ask if correspondence on UFOs and crop circles had been preserved. I said there was considerable public interest in its contents, in particular the private study of the subject, completed on his behalf by Peter Horsley in 1955.\n\nAfter a lengthy delay, Prince Philip's private secretary, Brigadier Archie Miller-Bakewell, responded: 'I am afraid that extensive searches have not yielded any papers that would be of help to your research. This letter comes with His Royal Highness's best wishes.'\n\nIf he did know the truth, the duke \u2013 private, discreet and careful to the end \u2013 took it with him. But what about King Charles?"

        "article_content": "Fears of an alien invasion in the US took hold in the 1960s and 70s after reports of UFOs hovering over military bases flooded the nation.\n\nNow, decades later, a UFO expert has claimed that the extraterrestrial spaceships did visit 'every major nuclear missile base' and continue to do so to this day.\n\nRobert Hastings, who has interviewed many Army personnel about the bizarre sightings, said: 'The ones that are currently operational, have been visited repeatedly year after year according to the sources that I have interviewed.'\n\nHastings recently made waves when he revealed more than 120 former service members had come forward about their encounters with flying objects near nuclear weapon storage and testing grounds.\n\n'A public, grassroots effort must be made in the interim to understand \u2013 as best as possible, using the data gathered thus far \u2013 the nature and intentions of those who pilot the UFOs,' Hastings penned in his recent book recounting the interviews.\n\n'Or perhaps they have a use for our planet, let's say for scientific purposes, and know that global nuclear warfare will disrupt their data-gathering and/or experiments.'\n\nIn his book, UFOs and Nukes, he revealed that investigators are prevented from properly probing the cases because of dubious layers of classification.\n\nOne thing is for sure, however, it is 'obvious' that if there are extraterrestrial visitors, they are 'greatly interested in our nuclear weapons.'\n\nA UFO expert claimed that UFOs have long visited nuclear bases and continue to do so. For at least 17 nights in December 2023, swarms of small 'drones' were seen penetrating the highly restricted airspace above Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.\n\nHastings' comments echo a study released in June that analyzed over 500 of the best-supported UFO cases from the heights of the Cold War, which concluded that 'this intelligence understands atomics, and they understand atomic weaponry.'\n\nUFO reports over America's nuclear arsenal appeared to shift from sites where the bombs were made to missile silos and US air bases as the Cold War arms race grew.\n\nThe study was conducted by a retired US Air Force staff sergeant, data analyst affiliated with Harvard's UFO-hunting Galileo Project Ian Porrit and a research team.\n\nThe group focused on official military and police reports of UFOs from 1945 to 1975, avoiding poorly supported accounts and ambiguous newspaper stories, to focus on cases with multiple witnesses and signal evidence, like radar.\n\nTheir study, which only covered US cases, also used reports of UFOs spotted above non-nuclear army bases and nearby civilian centers to act as control groups to test against their findings of any UFO trends at America's sensitive nuclear installations.\n\nThe team found that data from 1948 through 1975, showed support to the idea that extraterrestrials, or some other intelligence, has methodically surveilled America's rise to a nuclear power.\n\n'This intelligence understands the developmental cycle. They have some contextual knowledge of what they're looking at and what they're looking for,' Hancock told DailyMail.com, given these shifts in reported UFO sightings over time.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1952, as America's production of atomic weapons first ramped up, waves of UFO sightings began cropping up over Washington state's Hanford nuclear production complex, as well as Los Alamos and other sites for the Manhattan Project.\n\nHastings' recent claims come just weeks after new government records surfaced other UFO waves near military sites, including Joint Base Langley-Eustis (pictured)\n\n'What we know now is that inside the Air Force for the first seven to 10 years they sincerely believed it was the Russians,' Hancock told DailyMail.com.\n\n'And when they couldn't prove that,' he said, 'it became very political.'\n\nFrom 1952 onward, their study found cases of UFOs probing near active nuclear weapons took precedence, with a wave of sightings around America's new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) starting in the 1960s.\n\n'When you get to those ICBM bases, from about 1965 to 1975, these things are occurring at night,' Hancock pointed out.\n\n'And they are they are much more intrusive. They're very low altitude, they penetrate the security perimeters of the base,' he added.\n\nHastings' recent claims come just weeks after new government records surfaced other UFO waves near military sites, including 17 nights in December 2023 when swarms of UFOs were tracked over Joint Base Langley-Eustis.\n\nThese brazen penetrations over Langley \u2014 home to at least half the Air Force's F-22 Raptor stealth fighters \u2014 led to two weeks of emergency White House meetings.\n\nTo date, Langley's mystery UFOs have eluded identification by the Pentagon, police and even NASA's high-altitude research plane, the WB-57F, called in to investigate.\n\nGeneral Glen VanHerck, the commander with North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD), who led the mission to take down the infamous Chinese spy balloon in February 2023, described that Langley wave as unlike any other known case.\n\n'If there are unknown objects within North America,' General VanHerck told the Wall Street Journal, 'go out and identify them.'\n\nSenior ex-Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com last week that the UFOs were 'swarms of smaller craft' released by 'motherships.'\n\nHe explained that was 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\nMellon told DailyMail.com: 'I make no claims regarding their origin, perhaps many are Chinese drones.'\n\n'[But] in some instances,' Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'"

        "article_content": "Sleep is really important. Plenty of us don\u2019t do what it takes to get enough sleep \u2014 not to mention the fact that a large portion of people have sleep disorders that they don\u2019t even know about. We\u2019ve had sleep trackers and sleep-tracking tech to help us get a better understanding of our sleep for some time now, but AI could help supercharge the tech.\n\nIn fact, there are already plenty of AI-powered sleep apps already available. Curious about whether or not AI might be able to help you sleep? Here are some of the best AI-powered sleep apps.\n\nSEE ALSO: Apple Watch Series 10 introduces a new sleep apnea feature\n\nSleeptracker-AI\n\nSleeptracker has long been a favorite for tracking sleep and gaining a better understanding of it, but in recent years, the company has been leveraging AI tech to improve on what the app can offer. Sleeptracker is used in conjunction with a hardware tracker, which is placed under your mattress, and can track sleep of two people, with sensors on each side of the bed. The AI part of the app comes from the fact that Sleeptracker has trained its algorithms on data from over 1 million smart devices, combined with over 70 research studies, and vetted by Stanford Sleep Medicine and UCSF. The underlying tech was developed by Fullpower-AI, and it\u2019s considered one of the more accurate sleep-tracking systems out there.\n\nSleepScore\n\nSleepScore, by SleepScore Labs, is another much-loved sleep-tracking system, and another of the most accurate ones. SleepScore was developed by ResMed, and it uses the microphones and speakers on your phone to analyze your movements and your breathing patterns. SleepScore Labs also has another app, called \u201cDo I Snore or Grind,\u201d and it uses the same tech to detect how regularly you snore or grind your teeth.\n\nNightly\n\nNightly leverages AI a little more than some of the competition. Nightly tracks your sleep, to be sure, but it also plays AI-generated sounds designed to help you sleep better, and based on your environment, how your day went (based on your input), and more. It has various white noise sounds and beats that Nightly says will help users get deeper sleep, and more.\n\nSleep Cycle\n\nSleep Cycle is built around tracking your sleep with AI-powered algorithms, and actually using that information to help you feel better when you wake up. When you set an alarm in the app, it\u2019ll use your sleep cycle information to wake you up at the point of your lightest sleep, helping ensure that you start your day feeling great. It also uses ambient sounds to detect your sleep, so you don\u2019t need to wear anything or use other devices, if you don\u2019t want to.\n\nPillow\n\nPillow is designed to take some of the guesswork out of sleep-tracking. It leverages AI to process a massive range of data points around your sleep, and if you use it with an Apple Watch, you don\u2019t need to do anything to start tracking \u2014 it\u2019ll automatically track your sleep when it thinks you\u2019re sleeping. It\u2019ll even record audio when it detects you snoring, and use machine learning to give you a detailed sleep analysis after each night."

        "article_content": "It\u2019s important to have a home with a look you love. The difference between coming home to a poorly organized setup, versus one that looks intentional and put together, can be huge. But not everyone can afford to spend cash on an interior designer.\n\nThankfully, with AI, you don\u2019t have to spend that money. There are tons of great AI interior design apps to help you get the most out of your home, both when it comes to shopping for furniture and other items to round out your living space, and when it comes to maximizing the space with the items you already have.\n\nSEE ALSO: IKEA's new furniture line attempts to take gamers out of the basement\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the best AI interior design apps:\n\nHomestyler\n\nHomestyler is one of the most-loved AI interior design apps, not only leveraging AI tech, but also augmented reality (AR), to help you visualize a design in your actual space. You can upload images of your space to place furniture, decorations, and more in, and you can choose from a variety of styles, including Glam, Contemporary, Bohemian, and more.\n\nSpecific to AI is the fact that you can have the built-in AI Designer generate ideas of its own using your uploaded images, and based on your filters around style. You can even upload floor plans, and switch from interior designer to exterior design, so you can design every aspect of your home.\n\nRoom Planner\n\nRoom Planner is a little more minimalistic than some of the others, but that also means it\u2019s a little easier to use, and takes less time to get to actual ideas. You can have the app maintain your room\u2019s color-scheme, ensuring that you won\u2019t have to start from scratch when it comes to decorations and furniture. It\u2019s also free, and lets you generate as many images as you want. The service is in beta, so it might generate some weird ideas from time to time, but because it\u2019s free, it\u2019s hard to have a big issue with that.\n\nDreamhouse AI\n\nDreamhouse AI is one of the more powerful options on this list, and while it\u2019s not free, it is considered to offer some of the best designs. The service has a very user-friendly interface, and makes it easy to get up and running quickly, with high-quality designs and inspirations you can use to create your space.\n\nThe service has a monthly and yearly plan, and if you\u2019re moving into a new home, it\u2019s worth signing up for a month to get ideas for all the rooms in your new home \u2014 after which you can simply unsubscribe.\n\nREimagineHome\n\nPerhaps you\u2019d prefer to use a web-based app than one on your phone, in which case REimagineHome is the way to go. This service also lets you upload images of your space, and allows you to stage bare rooms, or redesign rooms that are already furnished.\n\nCoohom\n\nMost of the AI interior design apps so far can generate great ideas and inspirations, but what if you want ideas using furniture you already have? Coohom has a huge library of furniture that you can match to what you own, or at least find something pretty close \u2014 so you don\u2019t have to try and imagine what your furniture will look like in a space. You can even import 3D renders from other sources. The software is a little more advanced than others, and there\u2019s a bit of a learning curve \u2014 but if you\u2019re willing to spend some time learning how to use the software, you might get more personalized results."

Often times activity will reply by turning on the light, without anyone touching it.\n\nInvestigators also works with local community members and businesses to address their concerns of paranormal activity. They travel to private residencies and conduct investigations, answering questions and help provide peace of mind.\n\nWhile Halloween wraps up the ghost walks for the season, the organization remains involved with the community by hosting fundraisers and monthly meetings.

It is newsworthy when archeologists and paleontologists find a new location that contains fossils, but what about the first fossil discovery?\n\nChrissy: The earliest recorded discovery of a remnant of dinosaur history was in 1676 when Robert Plot found a huge thigh bone in England. Back in the early 17th century, dinosaurs weren't something that were part of public common knowledge, so these finds were either thought to belong to huge humans or mythical creatures.\n\nJasmine: It wasn't until the early 1800's that it was suspected that giant animals once roamed the earth and not giant humans. Gideon Mantell found a gigantic fossil while digging in the Sussex quarry which turned out to be one of the first known lguanodon teeth to ever be found. This was a key turning point in how scientists dug for and classified fossils.\n\nChrissy: A quest for paleontology supremacy brought forth the discovery of many new dinosaur genre during the American Gilded Age of the 19th Century. \"The Bone Wars\", a fierce and underhanded competition between Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope, saw the use of bribery, theft, destruction of bones, funding tampering, and public attacks in scientific publications that went on to publicly ruin both men financially and in reputation. Their losses brought forth gains for the Stegosaurus, Allosaurus, and Triceratops.\n\nJasmine: In the mid 1800's the word \"dinosaur\" was first coined by Sir Richard Owen, an English biologist and paleontologist. He recognized these giant ancient animals as the order of Dinosauria and began the modern era of dinosaur research and classification.\n\nChrissy: You've been listening to The Sound of Science on WNIJ, where you learn something new every day."

        "article_content": "Over the past few months, multiple reports have popped up on Reddit and Apple\u2019s official product forum regarding an iPhone 14 Plus issue that renders a black screen instead of a frame preview in the camera app. It seems Apple has finally caught wind of the complaints and has launched a servicing program to help affected owners.\n\n\u201cApple has determined that the rear camera on a very small percentage of iPhone 14 Plus devices may exhibit no preview. Affected devices were manufactured between April 10, 2023, to April 28, 2024,\u201d says the company.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\niPhone 14 Plus owners who have faced camera issues can now get their devices fixed without paying any charge. Users can choose to visit a nearby Apple Store or an authorized service provider, or they can send their unit via the mail-in route.\n\nIt seems the camera issue raised its head in multiple ways. For some users, only the primary camera was affected, but others report that the main and the ultrawide sensors showed a blank screen in the camera app. A few user reports mention that accessing the front camera also results in a blank preview.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been like this for a couple [of] days now. The front camera works fine, but the back is not responding. The screen is black when [the] back camera is turned on,\u201d says a report on Reddit. Measures like a hard reset or software update failed to provide any respite.\n\n\u201cI contacted my local shop where I bought the phone. They have an Apple partnership deal, so the phone got sent to [the] Apple workshop and got fixed on guarantee. I didn\u2019t pay anything,\u201d claims an affected user in the same thread.\n\n\u201cJust got the phone yesterday, set everything up \u2026 saw the front camera wasn\u2019t working \u2026 just a black screen,\u201d writes another iPhone 14 Plus owner on the Apple Discussions forum. From the testimonies that we have seen so far, it appears that Apple was working on a software-level fix but couldn\u2019t execute those plans.\n\n\u201cMy iPhone 14 plus front camera has not worked at all since buying the phone. The problem is affecting the camera app as well as [third-party] apps,\u201d claims an iPhone 14 Plus owner on the Apple Community forum.\n\nGoing by the language of Apple\u2019s update note, it is evident that this is a hardware-level issue, and only professional repair can fix it. In case your phone has been exhibiting similar woes, you can enter the serial number here and check if your iPhone 14 Plus qualifies for a free repair service."

        "article_content": "PostgreSQL database platform company Timescale has expanded its PostgreSQL AI toolset with the launch of pgai Vectorizer.\n\nThis is an open source (cloud hosted) software offering that promises to enable developers to build advanced AI applications without the need for external tools or specialised expertise.\n\nAs a popular database, PostgreSQL is used by 49% of developers worldwide according to StackOverflow.\n\nTimescale says it is dedicated to bringing cutting-edge technology to the PostgreSQL community, without needing specialized tooling or knowledge. The company did this by extending PostgreSQL for real-time analytics. Now Timescale brings AI to PostgreSQL with the pgai suite and the launch of pgai Vectorizer.\n\nManaging multiple tools Developers are under growing pressure to deliver AI systems such as search engines, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and AI agents. However, this often involves managing complex workflows across multiple tools: embedding creation, data processing and real-time synchronisation. New specialised tools emerge daily, adding infrastructure overhead and demanding new expertise, but few have the operational maturity or flexibility required for production. Pgai Vectorizer integrates the entire embedding process into PostgreSQL, allowing developers to create, store and manage vector embeddings alongside relational data without external tools or added infrastructure. Together with the full pgai suite, it integrates the entire AI workflow into PostgreSQL, simplifying complex workflows into a single system. This enables developers to build state-of-the-art AI applications with fewer resources using familiar SQL commands. \u201c[I feel that] pgai Vectorizer is a game-changer. It promises to streamline our entire AI workflow, from embedding creation to real-time synchronization, allowing us to deliver AI applications faster and more efficiently,\u201d said Web Begole, CTO at MarketReader.\u201cBy integrating everything directly into PostgreSQL, pgai Vectorizer removes the need for external tools and expertise, making it easier for our team to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure.\u201d Thousands of developers are already using the pgai suite of AI tools, and with pgai Vectorizer, they now have even greater power to streamline workflows and accelerate AI development."
