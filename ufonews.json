            "article_content": "An upcoming documentary about the UFO/UAP phenomenon promises to be the most well-sourced and credible film every made about the buzzy topic and its first trailer has just been released (below).\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure, by filmmaker Dan Farah, features on-record interviews with 34 current and former senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community with direct knowledge of unidentified aerial phenomena. The film contends there has been an 80-year cover-up of the existence of non-human intelligent life and a secret war among major nations to reverse engineer UFO technology. As announced earlier Wednesday, The Age of the Disclosure has earned first-time director Farah a coveted premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival, where it will screen at the historic Paramount Theatre in March.\n\nSome of the officials interviewed include newly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio (who says in the trailer that, when it comes to this subject, \u201ceven presidents are operating on a need-to-know basis\u201d), New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds and General Jim Clapper (who was a U.S. director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama).\n\nFrom the official description: \u201cThe film was granted unprecedented access and support from senior members of the U.S. government, military and intelligence community. Everyone interviewed in the film has direct knowledge of UAP as a result of their work for the U.S. Government. The film exposes the profound impact the situation has on the future of humanity, while providing a look behind the scenes with those at the forefront of the bipartisan disclosure effort.\u201d\n\nJim Semivan, who spent 25 years as a senior official with the CIA, says in the trailer: \u201cUAPs are here, they are real and they are not human.\u201d Adds Jay Stratton, former director of the U.S. government\u2019s UAP task force: \u201cThe first country that cracks the code on this technology will be the leader for years to come. This is similar to The Manhattan Project; this is the atomic weapon on steroids.\u201d\n\nFormer Department of Defense official and longtime UAP disclosure advocate Christopher Mellon declares, \u201cThis is the biggest discovery in human history,\u201d while former Department of Defense official and member of the government\u2019s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program Luis Elizondo says, \u201cYou have information being locked away that can change the trajectory of [our] species.\u201d\n\nThe Age of the Disclosure was made in secret over the past two years and filmmakers are currently in talks for commercial distribution plans; Cinetic is handling domestic sales.\n\nThe film follows a surge of public interest in the subject and two bipartisan congressional hearings over the past year where former officials and whistleblowers gave testimony claiming non-human intelligent life has visited Earth and that the U.S. has been engaged in a decades-long cover-up in an effort to reverse-engineer alien technology.\n\nFarah\u2019s producing credits include Ready Player One, which likewise scored a SXSW Film Festival premiere at the Paramount in 2018. The Age of Disclosure is a Farah Films production, in association with Born Ready Films. Produced and directed by Farah, executive producers are Colin Frederick, Andrew Farah and Shara Senderoff."

            "article_content": "COMMISSIONED: Among the many tough decisions IT leaders face is where to best host AI workloads.\n\nWhether you\u2019re deploying traditional AI applications that predict supply chain performance or launching generative AI digital assistants that serve information to customers, the location options for such software are myriad.\n\nYet the calculus has changed. For the first time in probably a decade, the public cloud is not necessarily the first destination that you IT leaders turn to. In fact, Gartner expects that 50 percent of critical enterprise application workloads will reside outside the public cloud through 2027.\n\nYou know, of course, that many factors go into workload placement. Yet it almost always starts with a single consideration: your data. And AI demands a lot of it. Especially the modern GenAI applications that are transforming digital operations worldwide.\n\nAvoiding Cloud Sins Of The Past\n\nGenAI apps create vast volumes of unstructured data such as text, audio and video. The more data such apps generate, the more that data gravity weighs on an organization\u2019s workloads and the harder they become to move.\n\nIronically, you IT leaders have likely already experienced this challenge during the \u201ccloud-first\u201d phenomenon of a decade ago, as your organizations rushed to capitalize on the agility and innovative prospects promised by the public cloud.\n\nIn recent years \u2013 and for various reasons \u2013 you and your peers have probably removed some application workloads from the public cloud.\n\nSome of you realized your providers couldn\u2019t meet data locality regulations. Others erred in refactoring applications for the public cloud only to watch them break. Still others found the more data they created, the more expensive it became to run their applications.\n\nTo put this into a consumer-friendly perspective, consider the platform shift from cable TV to streaming services over the past few years. Tired of feeling locked into contracts that included hundreds of channels they rarely watched, millions of customers \u201ccut the cord\u201d on cable TV, switching to Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+ and other services.\n\nThe public cloud has come to mirror cable TV, with providers launching dozens of services that IT leaders don\u2019t need. Moreover, as with cable TV, IT leaders came to feel locked in to their existing cloud contracts; when the renter\u2019s remorse kicked in, they began to move some workloads.\n\nAnd with compute and storage needs diversifying today, you IT leaders want more Netflix and Hulu, less cable TV, which is a big reason for some of the repatriation to on-premises systems.\n\nA Different Tack To Support AI\n\nYour organizations require a more prescriptive approach to their AI needs \u2013 one that affords them control over their corporate IP and data \u2013 while allowing them to maintain performance and meet resiliency requirements.\n\nAlso, AI inferencing can tax systems \u2013 it requires real-time access to data \u2013 so organizations must control the compute and storage that fuel their AI applications. Controlling these resources will also help your IT departments better manage the data gravity that attends AI applications.\n\nHow can you, as an IT leader, solve for such challenges?\n\nThere is no cookie-cutter approach, but one option includes maintaining a laser-focus on delivering the optimal business outcomes, regardless of where you choose to run your applications, whether this includes your own datacenters, with the ability to extend to AI PCs and other devices at the edge.\n\nThis approach, known as helps you meet performance requirements and reduce latency while ensuring that your data is secure and compliant with data locality and sovereignty rules. There are paths to enterprise AI that may be kinder to your budget.\n\nFor example, you might consider deploying open-source models on-premises, which helps you bring AI to your data while right-sizing your model(s) to meet your operational requirements. Pre-trained models incorporating retrieval augmented generation help refine results with corporate data and run well on GPU-powered servers behind the corporate firewall.\n\nDeploying Meta\u2019s Llama 2 model on-premises with RAG proved as much as 75 percent more cost-effective than running GenAI workloads in Amazon Web Services\u2019 public cloud, according to a survey conducted by Enterprise Strategy Group. ESG also found that running Mistral\u2019s 7B open-source model with RAG on premises was found to be 38 percent to 48 percent more cost-effective than AWS.\n\nThese are key savings at a time when the cost of inferencing rises over the lifetime of a model.\n\nCultivating enterprise AI isn\u2019t easy; most organizations lack the technical wherewithal to build such an operating model let alone stand up the architecture and infrastructure modernized for AI.\n\nIt also requires experts who can help you get your data house in order so you can run your models with the performance and efficiency you need at the right cost. Who you choose as your trusted advisor will help shape the outcomes of your AI strategy.\n\nLearn more about the Dell AI Factory.\n\nClint Boulton is senior advisor of AI portfolio marketing at Dell Technologies.\n\nContributed by Dell Technologies."

            "article_content": "All sorts of ghosts from the altruistic to the diabolic haunt movies, but it takes a while to get a bead on the entity drifting, and at times racing, through Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cPresence.\u201d However benign or malicious \u2014 whatever its life or death, possible eternal salvation or never-ending damnation \u2014 this spirit seizes your attention from the get-go because everything in this twisty, technically virtuosic, surprisingly moving chiller is shot from its point of view. From the moment the movie opens, you see what it sees: the good, the banal, the private, the scary. The kicker? Soderbergh is holding the camera \u2014 he\u2019s the ghost in this machine.\n\nIt\u2019s a typically well-oiled, polished, frictionless Soderbergh whatsit. Like many ghost stories, it takes place in one of the most historically troubled of all movie locations: an outwardly normal family home. There, in an attractive two-story suburban house with plenty of natural light, a wraparound front porch and a spacious backyard, the spirit wanders the handsome, blandly tasteful rooms and looks out the many windows. Although apparently confined to the house\u2019s interior, it never feels trapped. Even so, given all the mileage that it racks up as it moves from the downstairs kitchen to the upstairs bedrooms, it is demonstratively restless.\n\nThe ghost seems pretty benign despite the unease it stirs up. It\u2019s attentive and obviously interested in the family of four that moves in soon after \u201cPresence\u201d opens. If anything, the ghost seems eager for company. It routinely follows the family around, particularly the daughter, Chloe (Callina Liang, lovely), like a faithful dog \u2014 that is if that pooch were invisible and human size. (The height of the ghost\u2019s point of view is a tell.) It\u2019s curious yet also seems reserved. It likes to hang out in Chloe\u2019s closet and when she takes a shower, it stays outside the bathroom and tidies up, which suggests that it\u2019s not \u2014 or, rather, wasn\u2019t \u2014 a creep.\n\nThe screenwriter David Koepp seeds the story with such clues, giving you just enough back story and present-day information to stir your curiosity and keep you guessing as he and Soderbergh ratchet up your anxiety. A genre savant with a raft of big credits (\u201cJurassic Park\u201d), Koepp has an affinity for stories set in confined locations, especially those outwardly safe spaces that become mousetraps: He wrote David Fincher\u2019s \u201cPanic Room,\u201d a thriller set almost entirely inside a brownstone, as well as Soderbergh\u2019s thriller, \u201cKIMI,\u201d about an agoraphobic woman swept up in an intrigue. \u201cPresence\u201d is another ideal trap to trip for a filmmaker who enjoys challenges and changing it up artistically as much as Soderbergh does."

Children younger than age 13 will not be permitted into the show.\n\n\"Our show is rated R, so we don't allow children under the age of 13,\" Copeland said. \"The show contains horror, violence and imagery, bad language and adult humor ... It's a horror circus. All of our acts are performed by horror creatures and characters, zombies, vampires, ghosts, what have you. It's great because you don't have to wait until Halloween to have fun with some smoky, scary, sexy entertainment.\"\n\nParanormal Cirque II is a branch of Cirque Italia, which has five shows crisscrossing the United States. Last year, two of its shows went to Canada for the first time, and two new shows will be touring Canada this summer.\n\n\"We're very excited to be bringing our (Cirque Italia) show tally up to seven touring productions,\" Copeland said. \"There are three units of Paranormal Cirque. We are Paranormal Cirque II, and we're the best.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nParanormal Cirque I, began in 2018, followed by Paranormal Cirque II in 2022, and Paranormal Cirque III beginning in 2023.\n\n\"In fact, Albuquerque was our first stop with Paranormal Cirque II,\" Copeland said. \"(Albuquerque) got to see the world premiere of our show ... Paranormal Cirque is a very popular show, which is why we have three units and soon to be a fourth Canadian unit as well.\"\n\nParanormal Cirque II is made up of a crew and company of about 50 people.\n\n\"Everybody does everything,\" Copeland said. \"The people that sell you your popcorn and concessions are the ones that help put up the tent. The people that are taking you to your seat for the show are also running the sounds and lights. In addition to being a comedian in the show, I'm also the social media director and publicity director for the unit. We all wear multiple hats here and we all do different jobs to get the show down the road.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe production features an international cast of performers. Copeland is one of two American performers.\n\n\"We have lots of performers from Latin American countries, and everybody has come from different backgrounds, some circus, some theater, some dance,\" he said. \"We have a truly eclectic variety of performers with our show.\"\n\nCopeland encourages eventgoers to arrive an hour prior to the show to be part of the \"haunt attraction preshow.\"\n\n\"During that time, you can meet our performers up close and personal,\" he said. \"They're going to scare your pants off before they wow you on stage.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnacks such as popcorn, cotton candy, nachos, hot dogs and nonalcoholic beverages will be available for purchase. Souvenirs, masks, hats and 1950s pin-up girls drawn in a paranormal style by artist Ryan Combs, will also be sold.\n\nEventgoers can also take part in a QR code hunt.\n\n\"You can go around and find seven QR codes, scan them with your phone and find out fun information about our show, about our company and some of our performers,\" Copeland said. \"That all begins one hour before showtime. It's included with your ticket. And in addition to that, I just want to remind people to get their tickets early, either paranormalcirque.com or at the ticket office once we're in town. I just wouldn't recommend waiting until the last minute, because some of our shows are already close to selling out, and we don't want anyone to miss the fun.\""

He worries about his teen kids, a competitive swimmer named Tyler (Eddy Maday) and a despondent, socially cloistered student named Chloe (Callina Liang).\n\nTwo of Chloe\u2019s friends recently died, suspected victims of drug overdoses, or possibly suicide.\n\nA despondent, socially cloistered student named Chloe (Callina Liang) is spied upon by an invisible entity in the closet in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s scareless ghost movie \u201cPresence.\u201d Courtesy of Neon\n\nChris pushes Chloe to be more outgoing and get on with life. Rebekah dismisses him and says time will be the best medicine, setting up a cold war of not-so-passive resistance between the two.\n\nMeanwhile, Tyler refuses to cut Sis any slack, accusing her of acting weird and being embarrassing. He does, however, introduce her to his friend, Ryan (West Mulholland), a confident kid with a mop of hair and a seductive approach that seems perfect for the insecure Chloe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about you,\u201d he coos. \u201cYou are in control.\u201d\n\nRemember, we witness all of this domestic drama as the entity, constantly roaming through the house, ducking into closets and corners undetected. Except when Chloe senses its presence and believes it might be one of her deceased friends.\n\nShe nearly freaks when she discovers that something has moved her books around and tidied up her room while she took a shower.\n\nWhen we, the entity, trash a closet and knock things off the furniture, Chris and Rebekah reluctantly allow a woman with Second Sight, Lisa (Natalie Woolams-Torres), into the house to communicate with us, the entity.\n\nA strong-willed wife and mother (Lucy Liu) senses she is being watched (and she is!) in \u201cPresence.\u201d Courtesy of Neon\n\n\u201cIt is confused,\u201d Lisa says. She reports that the spirit feels a need to accomplish something but doesn\u2019t know what.\n\nSoderbergh \u2014 director/cinematographer/editor using two pseudonyms \u2014 takes a bold gamble to create an appealing supernatural tale that doesn\u2019t qualify as horror and barely squeezes its thriller credentials in under the wire.\n\nHe uses strong actors, with superlative performances by Sullivan, Liu and especially a transcendent Liang, in a story that, like \u201cHeretic,\u201d proves the existence of God and the afterlife in the final shot.\n\nStill, \u201cPresence\u201d does not fully work for me.\n\nSo many inconsistent details kept me from buying into the story\u2019s internal logic.\n\nWhy do we, the entity, spend so much time apparently walking backward? To keep characters coming toward the camera perfectly in frame?\n\nWhy do we, the entity, race up staircases to observe something on the second floor in some scenes (consistent with the point-of-view), but in other scenes, Soderbergh simply cuts to the second floor?\n\nWhen we, the entity, destroy a closet and wreck a bedroom, why do we, the audience, see it as if we\u2019re standing on the other side of the room?\n\nWhy does the movie demonstrate that we, the entity, possess the ability to violently move and destroy objects, but when a character\u2019s life becomes threatened, we, the entity, inexplicably become powerless to interfere?\n\nHey, it\u2019s a ghost movie.\n\nAnd one that might make Chekhov turn over in his grave.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nStarring: Lucy Liu, Chris Sullivan, Callina Liang, Eddy Maday, West Mulholland\n\nDirected by: Steven Soderbergh\n\nOther: A Neon theatrical release. Rated R for teen drinking, language, sexual situations. 85 minutes."

BioNeMo is a collection of ready-made tools for designing and training biomolecular AI models for drug discovery, protein engineering, and virtual screening processes.\n\nThe proof-of-concept was designed to demonstrate the power of pairing AI with lab orchestration to automate molecular screening. Using both solutions, Artificial automated a workflow for screening candidate compounds for the SARS-CoV-2 main protease which is critical for viral replication and a target for COVID-19 therapies. The results \u201csuccessfully demonstrated how AI-driven methodologies can accelerate virtual screening and drug discovery processes,\u201d the company stated.\n\nWhile highlighting the benefits of the integration, Artificial\u2019s CEO David Fuller noted that \u201cto accelerate the development of gene therapies and life-saving drugs, or rapid pandemic response, the industry is increasingly recognizing the importance of adopting the latest breakthroughs in AI and machine learning\u2014it is where the market is heading.\u201d\n\nThe company also announced that it has received ISO 27001 and SOC 2 accreditations, which \u201creflect our dedication to our customers\u2019 security and compliance needs and give them confidence in our solutions as they go on this journey,\u201d he added. ISO 27001, the international standard for information security management, validates Artificial\u2019s framework for protecting data and minimizing security risks. The SOC 2 accreditation recognizes the company\u2019s operational transparency and commitment to safeguarding sensitive information.\n\nArtificial will showcase its platform during the 2025 Society of Laboratory Automation and Screening Conference which is taking place in San Diego, CA.\n\nThe partnership with Artificial is just one of several involving the use of Nvidia\u2019s artificial intelligence capabilities.

            "article_content": "Free Newsletter Get the hottest Fintech Singapore News once a month in your Inbox\n\nThe Asian banking sector in 2025 is set to roar as it stands at the forefront of a global transformation in financial services.\n\nWith annual revenues from corporate and investment banking (CIB) exceeding USD $1.4 trillion, the region commands nearly half of the world\u2019s CIB revenues. Currently, it is also projected to sustain 7% annual growth through 2027. According to Fitch Ratings, Asia\u2019s banking landscape has been reaping the benefits from the stabilising interest rates and positive economic momentum, with pockets of opportunity emerging across diverse markets.\n\nTransaction banking, which includes cash management and trade finance, has also been pivotal in driving growth and deepening client relationships across Asia. Additionally, private credit\u2019s rise in Asia\u2019s financial markets offers an exciting avenue for innovation and competitive positioning.\n\nFollowing a recent webinar on Cracking the Code of Asia\u2019s Banking Trends in 2025 and Beyond, we\u2019ve invited some notable players in the financial landscape to walk us through the latest up-and-coming trends within the banking sector in this region.\n\nThe Asian financial landscape is being revolutionised at lightning speed by innovation. However, amidst this whirlwind, distinguishing actionable trends from the noise is becoming more and more challenging.\n\nEmphasis on Profitability and Growth\n\nTo begin the 2025 list of top banking trends in Asia, we first must take a look at what drives banks the most\u2014profits and growth.\n\nThe journey towards profitability and sustained growth has always become a central theme for digital banks, not just in Asia but also across the globe. Jessica Lam, Group Chief Strategy Officer at WeLab, highlighted that, after years of financial discipline during challenging market conditions (especially during the COVID-19 era), banks are now positioned to focus on scaling their operations.\n\nShe noted that stabilised markets have created an environment ripe for expansion. This is where institutions can confidently invest in new technologies and enter untapped markets.\n\nJessica remarked, \u201cNow that many of us have proven the proof of concept works, the next step is scaling up responsibly.\u201d\n\nThis transition signifies a shift from merely surviving economic turbulence to thriving by leveraging improved financial frameworks and consumer trust. Furthermore, many banks are now exploring strategic partnerships and collaborations, particularly in Southeast Asia, to accelerate growth and streamline operations.\n\nHyper-Personalisation Through AI\n\nAs seen in the top 5 trends shaping the fintech scene in Singapore, AI has been the talk of the town for the banking sector since it first shared its limelight back in 2020. This came as no surprise, as Artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to create highly personalised banking experiences\n\nAlbert Tinio, Co-CEO of GoTyme Bank Philippines, emphasised that AI\u2019s potential lies in its ability to understand individual customer behaviours and preferences at an unprecedented scale. This enables banks to offer bespoke financial solutions tailored to the specific needs of each customer. By doing so, they enhance satisfaction and loyalty.\n\nAlbert elaborated, \u201cWe\u2019re now able to create hyper-connected ecosystems where data shared securely can benefit the end customer.\u201d\n\nSuch hyper-connectivity is not limited to financial services. It also extends across industries, enabling seamless integration of financial tools into everyday activities.\n\nMeanwhile, Taruni Ramamurthi, Head of FSI Malaysia and Philippines at Amazon Web Services, underscored the ethical considerations of AI deployment.\n\nShe stated that AI should be a tool to enhance human-centric banking, ensuring customer trust remains intact. With AI being widely adopted for fraud detection, compliance, and customer engagement, banks are focusing on ensuring transparency and accountability.\n\nThese efforts aim to build and maintain consumer confidence. Generative AI applications are also gaining traction, allowing banks to automate complex processes such as risk analysis and predictive modelling. This, in turn, improves efficiency significantly.\n\nOpen Banking and Collaboration\n\nOpen banking is also gradually becoming a reality across Asia, albeit at varying levels of adoption. Albert highlighted the slow but steady progress in the Philippines. Regulators are working to ensure that consumer consent and data security are prioritised.\n\n\u201cFor open banking to succeed, all institutions need to embrace collaboration and share data responsibly,\u201d Albert stated.\n\nThis collaborative model allows customers to access a consolidated view of their financial information, enabling them to make more informed decisions. Open banking also fosters innovation, as fintechs and third-party providers can develop new products and services through secure API integrations.\n\nJessica echoed these sentiments, adding that the true potential of open banking lies in its ability to create a more inclusive financial ecosystem. Open banking could drive significant advancements in financial inclusion across underserved markets. All of this can be made possible by lowering barriers to entry for new players and promoting interoperability.\n\nBranches Reinvented\n\nThe debate surrounding the relevance of physical branches in the digital era continues. However, their role is undoubtedly evolving. Taruni described branches as becoming \u201cexperience centres\u201d designed to address specific customer needs, such as financial education and community engagement.\n\nIn regions like Southeast Asia, where access to the internet remains uneven, branches serve as critical touchpoints for unbanked populations.\n\nJessica also weighed in on the transformation of branches, stating, \u201cThe purpose of branches should evolve to complement digital offerings, creating seamless customer experiences.\u201d\n\nShe suggested that future branches could blend digital tools with personalised human interactions to bridge the gap between traditional and digital banking. For instance, branches could host financial literacy workshops or offer specialised advisory services for small businesses. This approach fosters deeper customer relationships.\n\nAdding to this global shift, some Hong Kong digital banks are rethinking their strategies and considering physical branches following the HKMA\u2019s recent rule change, as reported by the South China Morning Post (SCMP). This change, aimed at supporting growth, allows for limited physical branches and has prompted digital banks like WeLab Bank, ZA Bank, and Mox Bank to explore offline strategies.\n\nWhile Livi Bank remains fully digital, other players see this as an opportunity to enhance trust and customer experience through face-to-face interactions and advisory services. Traditional banks in Hong Kong are also adapting by focusing on prime locations to attract wealth-management clients or integrating hybrid models, blending sustainability and digital-forward designs.\n\nSuch evolution highlights how branches are increasingly becoming versatile touchpoints that cater to both digital natives and those who value in-person banking experiences.\n\nIn addition, Frankie Wai, Business Solution Director at Temenos, mentioned that technology can further enhance the utility of branches. Features like biometric authentication and AI-powered kiosks could make in-branch services more efficient and appealing to tech-savvy customers while still catering to those who prefer face-to-face interactions.\n\nRegulatory and Ethical Challenges\n\nAs the banking sector embraces technological advancements, the importance of ethical considerations and regulatory compliance is becoming increasingly apparent. Frankie stressed that transparency and accountability must underpin the adoption of AI and open banking.\n\n\u201cRegulators are increasingly focusing on ensuring that technological advancements are used responsibly to safeguard consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nOne key area of concern is data privacy. With the rise of open banking and AI-driven insights, banks are handling vast amounts of sensitive customer information. This requires robust security measures and clear guidelines to prevent misuse.\n\nFurthermore, regulators across Asia are introducing frameworks to govern the ethical use of AI. These frameworks aim to ensure that algorithms do not perpetuate bias or discrimination.\n\nPayment Innovation and Cross-Border Collaboration\n\nThe payments sector is undergoing significant transformation, with cross-border interoperability emerging as a major focus area. Frankie also highlighted Asia\u2019s adoption of global payment standards like ISO 20022. These standards enable seamless and transparent regional transactions.\n\nHe believes that collaboration across borders will redefine how SMEs and individuals engage in international commerce.\n\nProjects such as Nexus, which aim to link payment systems across countries, are poised to create a unified regional payment ecosystem. These advancements not only facilitate trade but also empower micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to expand their reach.\n\nTaruni added that such innovations could be instrumental in driving financial inclusion, particularly for women entrepreneurs and underserved communities.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of AI in payment systems is streamlining operations, enhancing fraud detection, and improving user experiences. From biometric authentication to real-time transaction monitoring, these advancements are setting new benchmarks for efficiency and security in the payments landscape.\n\nThe Asian Edge\n\nThe trends show that the banking sector in Asia in 2025 reflects a unique confluence of rapid growth, innovation, and challenges that set it apart from other regions. The region\u2019s CIB market is growing faster than any other globally, with SMEs and green infrastructure investments acting as pivotal drivers.\n\nHowever, these opportunities exist alongside persistent risks such as volatile real estate markets in China and regulatory uncertainties. Comparatively, while Western economies focus on streamlining mature banking systems, Asia\u2019s landscape requires a nuanced approach to cater to diverse markets and evolving customer expectations.\n\nThe ability to balance technological advancement with ethical practices will be critical. Asia\u2019s banking leaders are well-positioned to redefine the global narrative, focusing on financial inclusion, sustainability, and innovation.\n\nInstitutions that adopt agile strategies and invest in cutting-edge technologies are likely to outpace their competitors, shaping the region\u2019s banking landscape for decades to come. In this pivotal era, Asia is not merely adapting to global banking trends but rather defining them.\n\nThe top banking trends in Asia showcase how the region is leveraging innovation to transform its financial landscape. With advancements in AI, open banking, and cross-border payments, Asia is setting benchmarks for global banking practices.\n\nCatch up on the Cracking the Code of Asia\u2019s Banking Trends in 2025 and Beyond webinar to dive deeper into the trends that are redefining the financial landscape in Asia.\n\nFeatured image credit: Edited from Freepik"

            "article_content": "An increase in compliance activities such as the creation of software bills of materials (SBOMs), performing software composition analysis (SCA) scans on code repositories, and securing the attack surface created by artificial intelligence (AI) applications are among the key software security trends highlighted in the latest edition of the Building Security in Maturity Model (BSIMM) report.\n\nThe annual BSIMM report, first introduced in 2008, analyzes the software security practices of organizations across eight verticals. It contains information on what\u2019s working, what isn\u2019t, what\u2019s changing about the risks and threat landscapes in software security \u2014 and how organizations are responding to those challenges. By comparing and contrasting their initiatives to what other organizations are doing, organizations can use the report as a measuring stick for software security.\n\nMore than 120 companies participated in the latest report, BSIMM15 \u2014 including the AARP, Aetna, Bank of America, Diebold Nixdorf, Eli Lilly and Company, Fidelity, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, Lenovo, MassMutual, Navy Federal Credit Union, SonicWall, Synchrony Financial, TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, and ZoomInfo \u2014 as well as 11,100 security professionals who collectively help 270,000 developers working on 96,000 applications.\n\nBut while legacy application security practices are good for general blocking and tackling against traditional software threats, they are no match for modern attacks coming from the software supply chain and AI/ML. Here are key takeaways from the BSIMM15 report \u2014 and why you need to go well beyond traditional AppSec practices to manage modern software risk.\n\n[ Get our Essential Guide: Software Supply Chain Security for Dummies ]\n\nA real world look into today\u2019s software threats and practices\n\nKey trends and insights in this year\u2019s BSIMM include:\n\n1. Organizations are grappling AI and ML. The opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are paramount for organizations. Key is the rise of AI-developed code with tools such as GitHub\u2019s Copilot.\n\nThe BSIMM15 report noted:\n\n\u201cWhen we talk to clients about what they\u2019re trying to do and the problems they have doing it, we see a wide variety of pain points, but in general, the problem that everybody is struggling with is uncertainty. There isn\u2019t a lot of well-understood guidance out there, so they\u2019re having to find the answers themselves. That uncertainty appears to be contributing to the formation of research groups to develop new attack methods \u2014 which increased 30% from BSIMM14 \u2014 and a doubling of the use of adversarial tests.\u201d\n\n2. Organizations are getting on board with compliance. Nudged by the self-attestation requirements for selling software to the U.S. government, organizations are prioritizing activities that support compliance and software supply chain security, such as creating SBOMs and performing software composition analysis (SCA) on code repositories. Organizations creating SBOMs for deployed software increased 22% over BSIMM14, while those performing SCA on repos jumped 67%.\n\n3. Security awareness training is in decline. Compared to BSIMM1, when 100% of organizations conducted software security awareness training, only 51.2% in BSIMM15 are providing basic security training to their teams, marking the lowest rate observed to date.\n\nThe struggle with AI is two-fold\n\nReversingLabs chief trust officer Sa\u0161a Zdjelar said the rise of AI, both within the organization and for software development, had left organizations flat footed. On the generative AI front, they\u2019re being pushed by their businesses into faster and faster adoption of AI without really sufficient governance on how to manage it safely.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest problems is most companies don\u2019t even fully know where AI is even being used. They\u2019re struggling to wrap their arms around how much of other people\u2019s AI they\u2019re already using. And when they build their own, they want to know which large language model is OK \u2026 How do you make it not just secure, but also actually safe, so it\u2019s not providing inappropriate answers that damage the brand and reputation of your company?\u201d\n\n\u2014Sa\u0161a Zdjelar\n\nAnd software supply chain risks are also being created by AI and ML implementations used to develop software, said Mike Lyman, one of the authors of the report and an associate principal consultant with Black Duck Software, BSIMM\u2019s sponsor. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily know where all that code is coming from. It may introduce risk like open source licensing risks. It may suggest using a code snippet that comes out of an open-source library with a copyleft license that requires you to release your code. So we\u2019ve got to recognize that type of stuff,\u201d he said\n\nLyman said that\u2019s why AppSec teams really need to focus on code reviews for everything, noting how many of the flawed code that has been written by humans is now being repurposed by ML.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realize that AI is learning to write code by looking at code we wrote. We\u2019ve never written perfect code, so AI is going to be making the same mistakes that we make in our code.\u201d\n\n\u2014Mike Lyman\n\nSoftware supply chain risk and shift everywhere\n\nJason Soroko, a senior fellow at Sectigo, said that the rise in use of SCA and SBOMs identified in BSIMM15 is a sign a growing interest in software supply chain security.\n\n\u201cIt indicates a growing appetite for systemic transparency and compliance. Organizations are finally acting on the idea that you can\u2019t defend what you don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nHowever, Soroko warned that it remains to be seen whether these incremental improvements \u201crisk being undone if core security knowledge and security culture decreases,\u201d which was also highlighted in the report.\n\nRL\u2019s Zdjelar said that he welcomed BSIMM15\u2019s focus on software supply chain risk, but said that organizations need to shift everywhere \u2014 across their entire software stacks \u2014 to manage risk across organizations.\n\n\u201c[BSIMM15] mentions software supply chain risk, but it\u2019s only in areas like software bill of materials and open source, not really around how software supply chain risks get introduced into companies by way of commercial software. If you think about how supply chain breaches have happened over the last six or seven years, all the breaches have been from commercial software packages, not open source.\u201d\n\n\u2014Sa\u0161a Zdjelar\n\n\n\nThe decline in training programs is worrying\n\nThe decline in security awareness training identified in BSIMM15 has been a trend since the start of the program, BlackDuck\u2019s Lyman said. \u201cBSIMM1 started with 100%, but there were only nine software security leaders in that first study,\u201d he said.\n\nAs soon as firms were added, it began to decline, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been on a slow, steady decline since BSIMM2, from about 80% to a low now of 51% doing basic software security awareness training\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think a lot of that\u2019s driven by budgets and also a been-there-done-that attitude. Companies have a software security training program and feel they don\u2019t have to revisit it. It falls out being a priority. And as most of us know, if it\u2019s not a priority, it tends to decay over time. So we think a lot of that\u2019s been what\u2019s in play.\u201d\n\n\u2014Mike Lyman\n\nAnother thing playing into the decline is a lot of companies mistaking their annual general security awareness training for software security training. \u201cKnowing how to avoid a phishing email, not clicking on suspicious links, and how to avoid malware, is very important, but it doesn\u2019t really tell you how to write secure code,\u201d he said.\n\nZdjelar said that there seems to be a decline in formal education when it comes to the right way to develop code, and a reliance on tools to do the work for you.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a very, very dangerous precedent because the tooling is also built by humans, humans who make mistakes in what is good, secure software. So I think it\u2019s a very, very bad practice to trend away from developer education and have over-reliance on tooling.\u201d\n\n\u2014Sa\u0161a Zdjelar\n\nWhat\u2019s needed for modern software supply chain security\n\nWhile the BSIMM data from real-life organizations are significant, Caroline Wong, director of cybersecurity at Teradata, said they are not representative of the mainstream.\n\n\u201cI think of it as the top 25% or so of existing software security initiatives that are included in the BSIMM study. These are organizations who take software security seriously and are on the cutting edge of innovation and maturity in this area.\u201d\n\n\u2014Caroline Wong\n\nWong said the fact that BSIMM remains a descriptive and not a prescriptive model is meaningful. \u201cThese activities have not simply been identified as \u2018a good idea\u2019 by a smart person, but rather a valuable enough idea that it passes ROI evaluations at an organization and has enough resource allocation to be considered active and operational,\u201d she said\n\nZdjelar said the problem with BSIMM is that it is not forward looking. He would like to see the next edition of BSIMM include more emphasis on software supply chain security risks posed by commercial software. And that means having the right tools for the job.\n\nTraditional application security testing (AST) tooling like SCA and other code scanning approaches are not capable of identifying modern threats, he said.\n\n\u201cRight now BSIMM mentions traditional legacy things like static code analysis and dynamic scanning. But they\u2019re missing what the most advanced companies are doing to manage their risk, which is binary analysis.\u201d\n\n\u2014Sa\u0161a Zdjelar\n\n\n\nZdjelar explained that binary analysis can flag supply chain threats that traditional AST tools can\u2019t find.\n\n\u201cSAST, DAST and SCA tools are not designed to find the presence of malware or presence of tampering or the fact that your CI/CD pipeline might have been compromised. That\u2019s not what they look for.\u201d\n\n*** This is a Security Bloggers Network syndicated blog from Blog (Main) authored by John P. Mello Jr..

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily K-12 Dive newsletter.\n\nThe last year was crucial for K-12 leaders seeking national and state resources to guide their schools and districts in integrating artificial intelligence into the classroom.\n\nBut just as schools received more AI support and tips from both the federal government and national organizations, warning signals on the repercussions of misusing the technology also emerged. From burgeoning lawsuits to a proliferation of deepfakes in schools, these challenges may slow schools down in their efforts to roll out AI tools, according to some K-12 technology experts.\n\nMaking the future even hazier, experts say they are uncertain how federal support for AI in K-12 will fare during President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nAs schools navigate the complexities around using AI in classrooms, here are four trends to look out for in 2025.\n\nDistrict and state AI guidance will rise\n\nWhile it\u2019s still unclear what direction federal AI policies for education will take under the second Trump administration, it\u2019s likely that schools will have to rely more on national organizations and nonprofits for high-level guidance in 2025 \u2014 and for several years to follow, said Kris Hagel, chief information officer at Peninsula School District in Gig Harbor, Washington.\n\nOver the past two years, the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office of Educational Technology developed useful AI resources and guidance, said Pat Yongpradit, chief academic officer of Code.org and lead for TeachAI. But Yongpradit said he doesn\u2019t expect similar federal assistance in the near future.\n\nThe Education Department\u2019s AI resources \u201creally set the tone for state education agencies,\u201d Yongpradit said, adding that \u201cregardless of what happens with the Ed Department, state education agencies are going to take it from there.\u201d\n\nWith more states expected to continue rolling out their own AI resources for schools, Yongpradit said he foresees more school districts following suit with their own policies.\n\nAs of November, 24 states had released guidance for AI in education, according to TeachAI, a national coalition that aims to guide schools on safe and ethical AI use. Code.org is a nonprofit that provides computer science curriculum and programs to schools.\n\nMore AI tools will be tailored to special education and English learners\n\nWith special education teachers increasingly expressing interest in AI tools, Yongpradit said he\u2019s hopeful \u201cmore tailored experiences\u201d will be on the horizon for this sector.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Looking ahead: As we celebrate the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology this year, Keith Burnett says it can be a reminder of how the benefits of physics span over decades. (Courtesy: Schmidt Science Fellows)\n\nLast year was the year of elections and 2025 is going to be the year of decisions.\n\nAfter many countries, including the UK, Ireland and the US, went to the polls in 2024, the start of 2025 will see governments at the beginning of new terms, forced to respond swiftly to mounting economic, social, security, environmental and technological challenges.\n\nThese issues would be difficult to address at any given time, but today they come amid a turbulent geopolitical context. Governments are often judged against short milestones \u2013 the first 100 days or a first budget \u2013 but urgency should not come at the cost of thinking long-term, because the decisions over the next few months will shape outcomes for years, perhaps decades, to come. This is no less true for science than it is for health and social care, education or international relations.\n\nIn the UK, the first half of the year will be dominated by the government\u2019s spending review. Due in late spring, it could be one of the toughest political tests for UK science, as the implications of the tight spending plans announced in the October budget become clear. Decisions about departmental spending will have important implications for physics funding, from research to infrastructure, facilities and teaching.\n\nOne of the UK government\u2019s commitments is to establish 10-year funding cycles for key R&D activities \u2013 a policy that could be a positive improvement. Physics discoveries often take time to realise in full, but their transformational nature is indisputable. From fibre-optic communications to magnetic resonance imaging, physics has been indispensable to many of the world\u2019s most impactful and successful innovations.\n\nEmerging technologies, enabled by physicists\u2019 breakthroughs in fields such as materials science and quantum physics, promise to transform the way we live and work, and create new business opportunities and open up new markets. A clear, comprehensive and long-term vision for R&D would instil confidence among researchers and innovators, and long-term and sustainable R&D funding would enable people and disruptive ideas to flourish and drive tomorrow\u2019s breakthroughs.\n\nAlongside the spending review, we are also expecting the publication of the government\u2019s industrial strategy. The focus of the green paper published last year was an indication of how the strategy will place significance on science and technology in positioning the UK for economic growth.\n\nIf we don\u2019t recognise the need to fund more physicists, we will miss so many of the opportunities that lie ahead\n\nPhysics-based industries are a foundation stone for the UK economy and are highly productive, as highlighted by research commissioned by the Institute of Physics, which publishes Physics World. Across the UK, the physics sector generates \u00a3229bn gross value added, or 11% of total UK gross domestic product. It creates a collective turnover of \u00a3643bn, or \u00a31380bn when indirect and induced turnover is included.\n\nLabour productivity in physics-based businesses is also strong at \u00a384 300 per worker, per year. So, if physics is not at the heart of this effort, then the government\u2019s mission of economic revival is in danger of failing to get off the launch pad.\n\nA pivotal year\n\nAnother of the new government\u2019s policy priorities is the strategic defence review, which is expected to be published later this year. It could have huge implications for physics given its core role in many of the technologies that contribute to the UK\u2019s defence capabilities. The changing geopolitical landscape, and potential for strained relations between global powers, may well bring research security to the front of the national mind.\n\nIntellectual property, and scientific innovation, are some of the UK\u2019s greatest strengths and it is right to secure them. But physics discoveries in particular can be hampered by overzealous security measures. So much of the important work in our discipline comes from years of collaboration between researchers across the globe. Decisions about research security need to protect, not hamper, the future of UK physics research.\n\nThis year could also be pivotal for UK universities, as securing their financial stability and future will be one of the major challenges. Last year, the pressures faced by higher education institutions became apparent, with announcements of course closures, redundancies and restructures as a way of saving money. The rise in tuition fees has far from solved the problem, so we need to be prepared for more turbulence coming for the higher education sector. Read more Keith Burnett: IOP president says it is our duty to make physics more inclusive\n\nThese things matter enormously. We have heard that universities are facing a tough situation, and it\u2019s getting harder for physics departments to exist. But if we don\u2019t recognise the need to fund more physicists, we will miss so many of the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nAs we celebrate the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology that marks the centenary of the initial development of quantum mechanics by Werner Heisenberg, 2025 is a reminder of how the benefits of physics span over decades.\n\nWe need to enhance all the vital and exciting developments that are happening in physics departments. The country wants and needs a stronger scientific workforce \u2013 just think about all those individuals who studied physics and now work in industries that are defending the country \u2013 and that workforce will be strongly dependent on physics skills. So our priority is to make sure that physics departments keep doing world-leading research and preparing the next generation of physicists that they do so well."

It\u2019s often said that any finished game, no matter how good or bad, represents a kind of miracle, the alchemical intermeshing of disparate elements of art, audio and code to breathe life into something unique (and something that probably only worked properly for the first time a few weeks before release). It\u2019s difficult, and, to the outsider, a bit mysterious. But it\u2019s also getting easier.\n\nSolo developer Gareth Damian Martin revealed to us recently that Citizen Sleeper 2 \u2013 along with Gareth\u2019s previous games \u2013 was built entirely using visual scripting. In other words, Gareth didn\u2019t have to type out endless strings of code to create this world. Instead, it was made from dropdown menus and flow charts. This game was dragged and dropped into existence.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's the kind of approach some game development software has offered for a few years now, including GameMaker, Godot and Buildbox. Many indie developers have started on these apps before embracing Unity and Unreal Engine 5, including the creator of upcoming game Hyper Light Breaker, and Heart Machine founder, Alx Preston, who's first game Hyper Light Drifter was made using GameMaker.\n\nCitizen Sleeper 2's no-code inspiration\n\nCredit: Fellow Traveller\n\nThe broader use of no-code, visual scripting workflows is hugely exciting for a number of reasons. For a start, it shows that someone with very little experience in coding can make a very good game indeed. Gareth\u2019s background is in illustration and writing, but they were able to pick up the elements of game design through the narrative game development tool Twine and later through PlayMaker, a visual scripting tool for Unity. This is hugely inspiring for artists everywhere who perhaps thought game design might be beyond their reach, or who might be scared off by the idea of typing endless pages of arcane code.\n\nCredit: Fellow Traveller\n\nPerhaps the knowledge that Gareth has succeeded will inspire others to follow. As Gareth has said, game development is now \u201cmore accessible than ever\u201d, and as a consequence, we might start seeing new and different games from people who might otherwise have never entered the games industry. People who might have thought coding wasn\u2019t for them, or whose brains work better through visual thinking than processing text. New voices and new perspectives are always welcome.\n\nThe scale of Gareth\u2019s success is another factor. Citizen Sleeper was a massive hit, reaching more than a million players, and it was showered with praise from critics. This is a professional looking game that displays no hint of the way it was made \u2013 which is important, because there\u2019s a tendency for programmers to be a little dismissive of visual scripting tools, deeming them to be a poor cousin to good old-fashioned typed code. And they\u2019re right, to a certain extent. Visual scripting, by its nature, isn\u2019t quite as malleable as typing code from scratch.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet at the same time, the tools \u2013 like Blueprints in Unreal or GML Visual in GameMaker \u2013 have been getting better and better. The fact that such a stunning game as Citizen Sleeper 2 has been made with PlayMaker might alert more people to how powerful these tools can be.\n\nHas game development become more accessible?\n\nCredit: Fellow Traveller\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVisual scripting is often used as a way to learn coding \u2013 for example, Scratch is a popular coding tool for kids that helps teach the basics in a visual way. Likewise, adults coming to coding for the first time can teach themselves the rules of how games work through tools like PlayMaker before learning the programming-language equivalents later on. Even those apps that offer no-code workflows, such as GameMaker and its GML code, encourage users to experiment with adapting the pre-made code and so learn how things are made.\n\nBut perhaps there\u2019s no need to move on from visual scripting. Perhaps, in the long run, and for most people, it will become the norm, like how the text-based commands of DOS were superseded by the graphical user interface of Windows. There will always be a need for people to dig down into the text trenches, to fix things and create functionality behind the graphical curtain, but perhaps in the future those people will be the minority, while most programmers will be dragging and dropping in their day jobs.\n\nIt might take a long time to get to that point. It will be hard to replicate the things that are possible with text in a purely visual environment. But in the meantime, visual scripting offers a way for people who might never have thought they were cut out for code to give game development a try. Maybe that\u2019s you. Maybe you\u2019ll make a game as big as Citizen Sleeper. Why not try?\n\nCitizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector will release 31 January for the best games consoles, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Nintendo Switch, as well as Steam."

            "article_content": "Virta Health is now prescribing GLP-1s to treat obesity alongside its diabetes-reversal program.\n\nVirta says it's doing $100 million in annual recurring revenue and seeing its growth accelerate.\n\nIts CEO says the startup aims to hit profitability by the end of 2025 ahead of a potential IPO.\n\nVirta Health has prescribed GLP-1 medications like Ozempic for diabetes since the startup began caring for patients in 2016. Now, it wants to prescribe the buzzy drugs to treat obesity, too.\n\nVirta made a name for itself in virtual diabetes care with its rigorous nutrition plans. The program aims to help patients reverse type 2 diabetes largely through personalized low-carb diets. The startup began treating prediabetes and obesity in 2020.\n\nWhile GLP-1 medications were originally developed to treat diabetes, the drugs have exploded for their weight-loss potential. However, previous clinical research has shown that patients gain back most of the weight lost with a GLP-1 when they stop taking the medication. That's a big problem for employers, who don't want to pay for the expensive drugs indefinitely.\n\nVirta now is positioning itself as a \"responsible prescriber\" for employers who want to manage the costs of covering those medications for their employees by pairing the prescriptions with nutrition support. The company says it can help patients lose the weight and keep it off \u2014 Virta released a study in February 2024 showing its program can help diabetes patients maintain their weight loss after they stop taking GLP-1s.\n\nVirta's expanded weight-loss program could be the last push the startup needs to get to profitability \u2014 and maybe even an IPO.\n\nThe company is now bringing in more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue, a 60% year-over-year increase, CEO Sami Inkinen told Business Insider. Virta expects even faster growth in 2025 as its weight-loss business accelerates.\n\nInkinen said Virta will be profitable by the end of 2025.\n\n\"An IPO is the next milestone for us,\" he said. He declined to provide details on Virta's planned timeline for a public market debut but suggested that the company wants to be profitable before it tests the IPO waters.\n\nVirta's biggest competitor, Omada Health, is using a similar strategy as the diabetes startup approaches an IPO. BI reported in October that Omada Health had filed its S-1 this summer; CEO Sean Duffy told BI later that month that Omada's obesity care program had become the entry point for most of its new customers.\n\nSami Inkinen, cofounder and CEO of Virta Health. Virta Health\n\nDigital health's weight-loss frenzy\n\nVirta and Omada's expansion into obesity care is one of many channels of the surging market for weight loss solutions, as consumers rush to get their hands on GLP-1s like Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nRelated stories\n\nTelehealth businesses like venture-backed Ro went big on new offerings to provide virtual weight-loss care alongside prescriptions. WW International, more commonly known as WeightWatchers, switched up its diet-centric approach in 2023 by acquiring digital health platform Sequence to offer GLP-1 medications to its customers. Ro's public competitor, Hims and Hers, bought a compounding pharmacy in September largely to prescribe knock-off versions of weight loss drugs like Ozempic while those medications are in shortage.\n\nInkinen emphasized that Virta has no financial reason to prescribe GLP-1s.\n\n\"We are not an online pill mill. We don't make money from the drugs, and we are not incentivized to prescribe drugs to make money,\" he said.\n\nAs the market has gotten more competitive, Inkinen said employers and health plans have increasingly honed their strategies for GLP-1 coverage. Previously, he said, employers either covered the drugs with few caveats or blocked payments for the medications altogether. Now, they're beginning to meet in the middle.\n\n\"You have to have a holistic approach, where you say, these drugs are a useful tool in the toolkit for some people, but you also have to have a nutrition-first approach, and prescribe any drugs in a responsible manner,\" he said.\n\nMost of Virta's patients aren't on GLP-1s today. Inkinen said about 30% of their incoming type 2 diabetes patients are taking GLP-1s when they begin Virta's program. He added that most of those patients can safely stop taking the drugs within the first year of Virta's diabetes-reversal program.\n\nThe startup said it plans to hire rapidly to meet increasing demand for its weight-loss offering, including by more than doubling the number of health coaches and medical providers on staff."

            "article_content": "PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nEvery antivirus app must, at a minimum, exterminate any malicious software it finds and guard against new malware attacks. Feature-wise, Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security goes way beyond that minimum with a large collection of bonus security features. However, lab tests and our own tests show that the core antivirus features need work. By comparison, Bitdefender Antivirus Plus has even more bonuses and routinely gets perfect lab scores, while Norton AntiVirus Plus also goes beyond the basics and beats Bitdefender in some of our in-house tests. Accordingly, you're better off choosing one of these Editors\u2019 Choice winners than Trend Micro.\n\nHow Much Does Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security Cost?\n\nFor $39.95 per year, you can protect one Windows PC with Trend Micro. That's a normal price for a single license; ESET, Webroot, and ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall (among others) come in on or about this price point.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike most competitors, Trend Micro doesn't offer a three- or five-device antivirus subscription. If you want a volume discount, you must upgrade to Trend Micro Internet Security, which lists for $79.95 per year for three licenses you can use on Windows or macOS devices. At the next level, Trend Micro Maximum Security gives you five licenses for $99.95 per year and extends protection to devices running Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and even Chromebooks. At the top of the protection pyramid you can pay $149.95 for the Trend Micro Premium Security bundle, protecting 10 devices. That gets you everything in Maximum Security plus Trend Micro\u2019s VPN, dark web monitoring, and premium support.\n\nA McAfee Antivirus subscription costs $54.99 per year and, like Trend Micro, protects just one PC. This one-per-customer pricing isn't the best if you aim to protect multiple PCs with a simple antivirus. You can get five G Data licenses for $49.95 or ten Vipre Antivirus Plus licenses for $76.99, for example. With Sophos Home Premium, a $60 subscription gets you 10 licenses you can manage remotely, which can be handy if you\u2019re the go-to tech support for your extended family.\n\nGetting Started With Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security\n\nDuring installation, you either supply an activation code or opt for a time-limited trial. You can also create or log into an online account and install the Trend Micro Toolbar in your default browser. A welcome screen celebrates your protection and allows you to explore further. During that exploration, you\u2019ll activate the Folder Shield component for ransomware protection and possibly protect additional browsers.\n\nTrend Micro's main window doesn\u2019t look much like other antiviruses, though it has maintained its current appearance for years. A big, round Scan button dominates the window, with an indicator below to display security status. Above are four icons for Device, Privacy, Data, and Family. No, the presence of a Family button doesn\u2019t mean this antivirus includes parental control, although its macOS counterpart offers a simple content-filtering system. Clicking the Family icon just suggests upgrading to Trend Micro Maximum Security.\n\nA lightbulb icon at the main window\u2019s top encourages you to explore more features. It\u2019s a little bit like the recommendations from Bitdefender\u2019s AutoPilot. When you click the icon, it presents a few questions and points out components that relate to your answers.\n\nMostly Failed Lab Tests\n\nAt independent testing labs around the world, teams of antivirus researchers evaluate just how well each antivirus protects against malware attacks of all kinds. The labs can throw serious resources at the testing process, more than I can do myself, so I monitor their results closely. Two of the four labs I follow include Trend Micro, meaning they consider it important enough to track. However, its current scores range from near decent to dreadful.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExperts at AV-Test Institute rate antivirus utilities on three distinct criteria. With six points apiece for protection, performance, and usability, the top possible score is 18 points, and that\u2019s just what Trend Micro scored at the time of my previous review. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t appear in the latest reports from this lab. Most of the antiviruses in that latest test did reach a perfect 18, among them Avira Antivirus Pro, G Data Antivirus, and Microsoft Defender.\n\nThe researchers at AV-Comparatives run security tools through a wide variety of tests, assigning Standard certification to any that pass. Outstanding performance can earn Advanced certification or even Advanced+. I focus on three tests from this lab, and Trend Micro appears in all three of the reports, but it doesn\u2019t shine. In both the simple malware protection and the real-world test, it gets the label Tested, meaning it didn\u2019t even reach Standard certification. An Advanced rating in the performance test is nice but doesn\u2019t indicate strong malware protection. At the other end of the spectrum, Avast, AVG AntiVirus Free, and ESET earned three Advanced+ ratings.\n\nAt SE Labs, testers scour the internet for real-world malicious websites. Using a capture-and-replay technique, they expose each antivirus to the same recorded attack. Antiviruses can earn certification at five levels: AAA, AA, A, B, or C. Almost all the participants in the latest test came in at the top, with AAA certification, and none earned less than AA level certification. Trend Micro has frequently earned AAA certification in this test, but the last several reports haven\u2019t included it.\n\nMost test labs assign scores covering a range of results. With MRG-Effitas, an antivirus that doesn\u2019t exhibit a near-perfect performance simply fails. All but one of the tested utilities passed this lab's latest banking Trojans test. In the broader all-types assessment, an antivirus gets Level 1 certification if it utterly prevents all the malware attacks and Level 2 if it wipes out all traces within 24 hours. All but one of the most recently tested antiviruses passed this test, evenly split between Level 1 and Level 2. In both cases, the one failure was Trend Micro.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEach lab has a different way of reporting an antivirus utility\u2019s success or lack thereof. I\u2019ve developed an algorithm that maps each result type to a 10-point scale to derive an aggregate score for each antivirus tested by two or more labs. When last tested, Trend Micro\u2019s inputs included a perfect score from AV-Test, dragged down to a 7.4-point aggregate score by failures with other labs. This time, with no help from AV-Test, it rates a uniquely low 3.6 points.\n\nWith a perfect 10 points, AVG holds the very best aggregate score, but ESET and Avast are close behind with 9.9 points. In addition, AVG\u2019s score came from just two labs, while ESET appeared in results from three, and Avast swept all four. Clearly, success in these tests is possible. It\u2019s just not something Trend Micro has attained.\n\nOptimized Malware Scanning\n\nI always advise running a full scan immediately after installing a new antivirus. After that initial cleaning, real-time protection should defend against any new attacks. For suspenders-and-belt protection, Trend Micro schedules a weekly quick scan. Tested on my clean virtual machine, the quick scan finished in less than a minute.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can tweak the day and time for the single scheduled scan and optionally make it a full scan. A full Trend Micro scan on my standard clean test system required 77 minutes, about two-thirds of the current average time.\n\nMany antiviruses use that initial full scan to optimize for subsequent scans by flagging trusted files that don't need to be checked again. For example, a repeat scan with ESET NOD32 Antivirus finished in 11 minutes, down from almost two hours for the first scan. UltraAV took 42 minutes for its initial scan but finished a second scan in about 2.5 minutes. As for Trend Micro, its repeat scan finished in a little over a minute, cutting more than 98% from the initial scan time. It clearly benefits from optimization.\n\nUneven Malware Protection\n\nNot every antivirus has plentiful lab results. In fact, quite a few aren\u2019t tested by any of the big labs. I put every antivirus utility through my own hands-on malware protection tests to capture another set of results and get a feel for how the antivirus does its job. In my tests, Trend Micro\u2019s scores ranged from excellent to poor.\n\nMy basic malware protection test uses a folder of malware samples I collected and analyzed. Like most antivirus tools, Trend Micro started picking these off as soon as I opened the folder. A third of recent antiviruses have detected 90% or more at this point. ZoneAlarm wiped out 100% of the samples on sight, and TotalAV Antivirus Pro got 99%. G Data Antivirus wiped out 97% of these samples at this stage in its latest test. As for Trend Micro, it only eliminated 62% of the samples on sight.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTo be fair, some antivirus apps, including Avast One Basic, McAfee, and Webroot AntiVirus, don\u2019t even try to scan programs on access, preferring to wait for attempted execution. But when an antivirus does make the effort, I like to see a higher score than Trend Micro\u2019s.\n\nContinuing the test, I attempt to execute the samples that remain. That gives the antivirus a chance to exercise behavior-based detection and any other protective layers it has available. Trend Micro picked off more samples for 79% total detection at this stage. A few slips, like letting detected malware place executable files on the test system, dragged its overall score down to 7.6 of 10 possible points, among the lowest scores for antivirus apps tested with this set of samples.\n\nWhen I reviewed the previous edition of this antivirus, it scored almost the same, with 80% detection and 7.8 points. In the review before that, the scores were still about the same. And yes, each of the three tests used a completely different set of malware samples. Trend Micro earns consistently low scores on this test. Bitdefender has also exhibited some low scores, but its near-perfect lab scores offset those.\n\nNorton AntiVirus Plus has earned the best score among those tested with my latest malware collection, with 99% detection and 9.9 points. Avast, AVG, and UltraAV matched that score, while Malwarebytes came close, with 99% detection and 9.8 points.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA Trend Micro reviewers\u2019 guide stated ages ago that testing with samples more than a week old is not relevant to the real world. Given that it takes me four to five weeks to gather and analyze a new set of samples, there\u2019s no way I could hit that one-week cutoff. In any case, many competitors visibly have no trouble with the age of these samples.\n\nI do have another test that gives a very up-to-the-minute view, strictly testing each antivirus tool\u2019s response to recent threats. I challenge each antivirus with a collection of malware-hosting URLs discovered in the last few days by researchers at MRG-Effitas. I launch each URL, noting whether the antivirus diverts the browser from the dangerous site, eliminates the malware download, or fails in its protective task. Skipping any URLs already defunct, I continue until I have 100 data points.\n\nTrend Micro did most of its work at the URL level. In most cases, it displayed a big Malware Threat warning in the browser and a popup notification. It labeled a few as a Dangerous Scam Page and flagged others as a Ransomware Threat. For some files, it let the download proceed and actively reported no threats found. Checking those files with VirusTotal after the test showed they were harmless.\n\nWhen last tested, Trend Micro attained a perfect 100% score in this test. This time it only reached 84%, putting it in the bottom third of recent antivirus apps. Avira, Guardio, and Sophos managed 100% protection in their latest tests.\n\nBetter Protection Against Phishing\n\nMalicious websites and downloads must run the gauntlet of multilayered antivirus detection to perpetrate their chicanery. Phishing websites have it easy by comparison. They only need to bamboozle hapless visitors into entering their login credentials. These frauds masquerade as sites that require a username and password, anything from financial sites to online gaming.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf you enter your credentials on one of these fraudulent pages, you've given away the valuables from that account, whether it's the money from your bank or that RPG character you\u2019ve been buffing for a year. You can learn to spot phishing fraud, but it's smart to use the automated phishing protection from your security software as a backup.\n\nPhishing sites typically get caught and blacklisted quickly, but if the fraudsters duped a few victims before the takedown, they don't care. They just pop up another fake and keep on trolling. For testing purposes, I scrape reported frauds from sites that track such things, making sure to include plenty that are too new for any blocklist. I launch each potential fraud in a browser protected solely by the antivirus under test and simultaneously in instances of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, relying on each browser's built-in protection.\n\nIn the past, Trend Micro has earned many perfect and near-perfect scores against phishing frauds. This time, with 98%, it came close. Even so, five competitors reached 99%, and a half dozen scored a perfect 100% for phishing detection. Those 100% winners include Norton Genie, a tool devoted to protection against frauds and scams, VPN-focused NordVPN Plus and Surfshark One, and Avira, Guardio, and McAfee AntiVirus.\n\nPhishing is platform-agnostic\u2014you can foolishly give away your password on any platform that has a browser. Phishing protection, however, can vary between platforms. I tested Trend Micro Antivirus for Mac simultaneously with the Windows edition and got the same results in my phishing protection test.\n\nMultifaceted Ransomware Protection\n\nYour antivirus should be able to fend off any known malware, and behavior-based detection can foil some unknowns. But for every new malware attack, there\u2019s a Patient Zero, the victim that gets hit before any other. Antivirus may miss that zero-day exploit. Sure, an antivirus update will probably wipe out the attacker before too long. But if ransomware was involved, that still leaves your files hopelessly encrypted.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBecause failing to prevent a ransomware attack is so serious, many antivirus companies have started adding protective layers focused solely on ransomware protection. Some defend your files against all unauthorized changes. Others watch for behaviors that suggest encrypting ransomware. Still others maintain encrypted backups of your most important files for recovery after clearing up a ransomware threat. Trend Micro does a little of each.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nYou may remember that Trend Micro offered to enable Folder Shield during installation. If you skipped it, be sure to turn it on now. You can reach it by clicking the Data icon on the main window and then clicking the Configure button in the Folder Shield panel.\n\nFolder Shield prevents unauthorized programs from making any changes to files in your protected folders. By default, it protects your Documents, OneDrive, and Pictures folders\u2014you're free to add Desktop or other folders that are important to you. Trend Micro also protects files on USB drives, at least while they're mounted, and files in your OneDrive, Google Drive, and Dropbox folders (if present).\n\nFolder Shield can't directly access folders belonging to accounts other than the one that's logged in, so each user account needs to set up Folder Shield separately. Once they\u2019ve done so, you can see (but not change) settings for other users.\n\nFolder Shield doesn't interfere when you edit protected files using a trusted program, but it warns when an unknown process tries to make any modifications to files in protected locations. If the program in question is legit, you can trust it with a click. But if you don't know why you got the warning, block that access! If you're not around to see the warning, Trend Micro blocks unknowns automatically after a short while.\n\nI used two hand-coded non-standard programs to test Folder Shield: a simple text editor and a super-simple ransomware emulator. Both were successfully prevented from making changes to files in the Documents folder.\n\nI like to test ransomware protection by turning off other layers of protection to simulate an antivirus tool\u2019s handling of zero-day ransomware. Unfortunately, turning off Trend Micro's real-time protection turns off everything, including the ransomware layer.\n\nBesides blocking unauthorized access to sensitive files and detecting ransomware-like behavior, Trend Micro keeps a secure backup of all protected files. If ransomware manages to encrypt some of these before the antivirus kills it, the Damage Recovery Engine restores those files from the backup. Since none of my available samples could get past the other defenses, I had no way to see this feature in action.\n\nMore From the Trend Micro Toolbar\n\nTrend Micro\u2019s browser toolbar (for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox) powers the Web Threat Protection feature. This component took Trend Micro to 98% detection in my phishing protection test. However, there\u2019s more to the toolbar. Upon clicking its icon, you see four items: Web Threat Protection, Email Defender, Ad Block, and Pay Guard. A Password Manager link, present for my previous review, is no longer present.\n\nWeb Threat Protection also helps you avoid clicking on dangerous links in the first place. A green icon with green highlighting means that all's well\u2014if it\u2019s red or yellow, don't click! You can also set the extension to rate links on mouseover. Now if you hover the mouse over any link on any page, Trend Micro will double-check it for you.\n\nEmail Defender, formerly called Fraud Buster, integrates with your Gmail.com or Outlook.com email account to protect against \u201cscams and phishing attacks.\u201d I expected something similar to the email analysis performed by Bitdefender Digital Identity Protection or the Online Account Cleanup system in McAfee+, meaning I\u2019d have to give Trend Micro full control of my account. However, enabling it didn\u2019t trigger an access request. It simply put a button at the bottom of each email to \u201ccheck for potential threats in English or Japanese.\u201d\n\nAs expected, the Ad Blocker suppresses advertisements on the web pages you visit. A number overlaid on the toolbar button lets you know how many ads it blocked on the current page. When you click to open the feature, you don\u2019t get details about blocked ads, but you can turn blocking on and off, either for the current site or globally.\n\nTrend Micro's Pay Guard isolates your browser from possible attacks to protect your financial transactions online. It's a lot like Banking and Payment Protection in ESET, though it uses a sky-blue border instead of green to identify the protected browser and puts its banner at the bottom of the window instead of in the title bar. Bitdefender Antivirus Plus puts the protected browser on a separate desktop.\n\nPay Guard is meant to offer protection automatically when you visit a financial site, and it worked for most sites in my testing. If you don't see the blue border, launch PayGuard manually from the browser toolbar before banking online. Note that to configure Pay Guard, click the Privacy icon in the main window.\n\nStill More Bonus Features\n\nThe bonus features don\u2019t end with the browser toolbar, but some are easier to find than others. Mute Mode will find you if you launch a full-screen program. It works like the gamer mode in other security tools, suppressing interruptions so you don\u2019t drop frames because of a background scan or get fragged because the antivirus proudly announced a successful update.\n\nYou can also invoke Mute Mode as needed from the system tray menu. When you do so, you can set a time for it to turn off, have it suspend Windows Update while active, and even terminate specific other programs that might get in the way. For fine-grained control, you can set each program to terminate when invoking Mute Mode manually, automatically, or both.\n\nYou\u2019ll find the option to enable Social Networking Protection on the Privacy page, along with Pay Guard. This extends the color-coded link markup feature to \"most popular social networking sites.\" According to Trend Micro, these are Facebook, LinkedIn, Mixi, MySpace, Pinterest, and X/Twitter. So, it includes MySpace and Mixi, but leaves out Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok? This feature has been sadly in need of an update for years.\n\nNote that this link analysis is unrelated to the Check Social Network Privacy feature in the macOS edition and Trend Micro's suites. That feature actively examines your privacy settings and recommends changes if necessary.\n\nGiven the prevalence of webmail services that handle spam automatically, fewer and fewer users need a local spam filter. Buried in Settings, Trend Micro\u2019s spam filter works strictly with Outlook, and all settings except the on/off switch are embedded in its Outlook add-on. My test systems don\u2019t have Outlook, so I couldn\u2019t see this limited component at all.\n\nAlso, in the settings on the Network page, you\u2019ll find a feature called Firewall Booster. Trend Micro relies on the sturdy Windows Firewall for all typical firewall tasks. The booster component specifically adds protection against botnet-related attacks. It can also optionally display a warning when you connect to a non-secured wireless network.\n\nFeatures New in This Version\n\nThe latest release of Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security adds two new and somewhat arcane features: AI App Protection and blocking of \u201cpotentially dangerous website notifications.\u201d The latter is a simple checkbox on the Web Threats page in settings, while the former has a place of honor on the Data page alongside Folder Shield.\n\nJust what is a dangerous website notification? The most common example is a popup notification that pretends to be an antivirus warning. Follow its instructions and you\u2019ll find yourself downloading malware, not getting rid of it. Trend Micro now has a protection layer devoted to detecting this scam. Of course, it\u2019s only needed if the website in question gets past the app\u2019s other defenses. In testing, I couldn\u2019t find a way to trigger this feature.\n\nAI App Protection is laser-focused on protecting the essential files that make your AI apps work. This is specifically about apps on your PC and their local files. If you just fool around with ChatGPT and such, it won\u2019t help you. Even if you run the local ChatGPT app, it doesn\u2019t keep any local files. How do I know? I asked it!\n\nMy Trend Micro contacts suggested a few ways to see this feature in action, but they weren\u2019t compatible with my virtual machine test setup. In any case, the average consumer doesn\u2019t need this feature. I checked in with PCMag\u2019s AI experts, who characterized the feature as \u201ca solution in search of a problem\u201d and described it as appropriate for \u201cserious AI experimenters\u201d rather than average consumers.\n\nThis is a forward-looking feature, one that may have more impact on the average user in the future. Today, not so much.\n\nVerdict: Trend Micro Goes Beyond Antivirus, But It Has Still Has Work to Do\n\nTrend Micro Antivirus+ Security earned a fine score in our antiphishing test, but in other hands-on tests, it fared poorly, and its scores from the independent labs aren't encouraging. Yes, it offers a spread of security bonuses, but extras must build on a solid base. Note, too, that there\u2019s no volume discount. If you need to protect multiple devices or non-Windows devices, you must upgrade to a Trend Micro suite or choose a different antivirus. Which one? The labs routinely award top scores to Bitdefender Antivirus Plus, and it offers a collection of features to rival Trend Micro. Norton AntiVirus Plus is likewise no slouch in feature breadth and test scores. As such, these two remain our Editors' Choice winners for antivirus protection."

But the team behind the system, called DeepSeek-V3, described an even bigger step. In a research paper explaining how they built the technology, DeepSeek\u2019s engineers said they used only a fraction of the highly specialized computer chips that leading A.I. companies relied on to train their systems.\n\nThese chips are at the center of a tense technological competition between the United States and China. As the U.S. government works to maintain the country\u2019s lead in the global A.I. race, it is trying to limit the number of powerful chips, like those made by Silicon Valley firm Nvidia, that can be sold to China and other rivals.\n\nBut the performance of the DeepSeek model raises questions about the unintended consequences of the American government\u2019s trade restrictions. The controls have forced researchers in China to get creative with a wide range of tools that are freely available on the internet."

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump issued Russian President Vladimir Putin an ultimatum on Wednesday \u2013 make a deal with me to end the Ukraine war or pay a hefty economic price.\n\nTrump said he'd put all manner of taxes, tariffs and sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States and vaguely threatened secondary punishment against countries who do business with Moscow.\n\n\"We can do it the easy way, or the hard way \u2013 and the easy way is always better,\" he said. \"It\u2019s time to MAKE A DEAL. NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!\"\n\nThe missive followed a warning from Trump the previous evening that sanctions against Russia were likely if Putin refused to enter into negotiations to end the war. Trump repeatedly pledged to quickly end the bloodshed when he was a candidate, claiming at various points that he'd do it as president-elect or within 24 hours of arriving at the White House.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the conflict has proved harder to solve than Trump previously indicated \u2014 an issue he has blamed, in part, on constraints he faced in directly negotiating with Putin.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 21: U.S. President Donald Trump takes a question from a reporter during a news conference in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on January 21, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump announced an investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and took questions on a range of topics including his presidential pardons of Jan. 6 defendants, the war in Ukraine, cryptocurrencies and other topics. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nTrump told reporters during a January press conference that Putin wanted to meet with him but he felt it would be improper while Joe Biden was still in office.\n\nThe Logan Act prevents private citizens from corresponding with foreign governments with the intent of undermining U.S. foreign policy. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden quit speaking to Putin. His administration adopted the stance that the U.S. would provide military assistance to Ukraine for as long it takes to drive out Russian troops, unless Kyiv decided it wanted to change course.\n\nTrump said Tuesday evening that Putin disrespected Biden and wouldn't be permitted to treat him that way. He said he'd spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and would be talking with Putin.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"President Zelenskyy would like to have peace. He's told me that very strongly. He'd like to have peace, but it takes two to tango,\" Trump told USA TODAY during an impromptu news conference.\n\nAs for when and where he'd meet with Putin, the president replied: \"Anytime they want.\"\n\nAnd if Putin did not agree to enter into negotiations, Trump said he was \"likely\" to put sanctions on Russia.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for the world: Sign up for USA TODAY's Russia-Ukraine Crisis newsletter.\n\nWar in Ukraine: Putin draws a nuclear red line for the West\n\nRobert O\u2019Brien, who served as national security adviser during Trump's first term, said in an interview prior to the exchange that he believed the new administration would try to pressure Russia into cutting a deal by ratcheting up sanctions on the aggressor nation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI would expect President Trump to say, look, Vladimir Putin, if you don't come to the table and do so quickly, the sanctions are gonna be pretty significant and devastating,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\nO\u2019Brien said both sides would need to make concessions. But the former Trump national security adviser, who also served as as his special envoy for hostages affairs, did not believe the president was interested in a scenario where Putin would be able to rebuild his army and attack Ukraine in several years.\n\nIn a social media post on Wednesday, the U.S. president said he was not \"not looking to hurt Russia\" and emphasized that he \"always had a very good relationship\" with Putin prior to the start of the conflict. \"We must never forget that Russia helped us win the Second World War, losing almost 60,000,000 lives in the process.\"\n\nThe Russian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump sidesteps questions about how ceasefire would work\n\nMultiple times as a candidate, Trump declared that he could end the war in one day, going so far at a September debate as to claim he\u2019d get it done during the presidential transition. He backed off that timeline as the inauguration drew closer, vowing instead to have the war wrapped up within the next six months.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThat's a tough one, much tougher than it would have been before it started, I can tell you that,\u201d Trump told reporters at a Jan. 7 news conference at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cA deal could have been made just by an average dealmaker. A deal could have been made on that,\u201d he added.\n\nLast month Trump called for an immediate ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine after a meeting with Zelenskyy. But he has not said how one would work or how he plans to resolve the war. He has also declined to say whether he\u2019d continue to provide weapons to Ukraine and sympathized with Russia over its concerns about Ukraine\u2019s bid to join NATO.\n\nHe told reporters on Tuesday evening that he believes the European Union should be sending more money to Ukraine than the United States does.\n\n\"I mean, what are we stupid? I guess the answer is yes,\" he said, answering his own rhetorical question.\n\nAn 'excellent call': Trump, Zelenskyy speak for first time after election with Ukraine's future in doubt\n\nThe European Union says it has spent $145 billion since the start of the war on financial, military, humanitarian and refugee assistance to Ukraine. It has also committed to providing $20 billion in loans. The U.S. government has appropriated $175 billion to Ukraine since the beginning of the war, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAdvisers to Trump have talked at various points about freezing the war along the current battle lines during talks, delaying NATO membership for Kyiv for a period of 10 to 20 years in exchange for substantial military assistance and the withdrawal of Russian troops from eastern Ukraine, and the establishment of a demilitarized zone that would be patrolled by European peacekeepers to enforce an agreement.\n\nNearly three years after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow occupies just under 20% of Ukraine's territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War.\n\nUkraine has managed to take back some of its occupied territory, but its efforts to mount a counteroffensive have largely stalled as Russia has surged weapons and soldiers to Ukraine's northeast Kharkiv region with support from North Korean troops.\n\nRussia has meanwhile continued to bombard Ukrainian cities with missile and drone attacks, and it is trying to blockade its ports. Ukraine has stepped up drone attacks on Russian ships and infrastructure and also fired at targets inside Russia using long-range missiles supplied by the U.S. and European countries.\n\nNew administration looks for a negotiated end to the war\n\nAt a hearing last week, Trump secretary of state nominee Marco Rubio, who was later confirmed to the role, signaled it would be the official position of the administration that the Ukraine-Russia war be brought to an end.\n\nHe said sending unlimited aid to Ukraine for as long as it wants to keep fighting is not a realistic position and both countries would have to make concessions.\n\n\u201cNow what that master plan looks like is going to be hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cMy hope is that it can begin with some ceasefire.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration rushed to unload aid to Ukraine during the transition amid concerns that Trump would use military assistance as a bargaining chip. A Biden administration official told USA TODAY in January that the U.S. had exhausted all the funding that Congress previously appropriated.\n\nTrump pushes for end to the conflict: Donald Trump calls for 'immediate' ceasefire in Russia-Ukraine war after meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nIn an interview before the inauguration, Rep. Michael McCaul, who was chairman of the House Foreign Affairs committee until early January, said he did not know whether Trump would ask Congress for additional money.\n\n\u201cI'm hoping that Trump sees who Putin really is, you know, in this process, and he's not a good faith partner. He's not a good faith negotiator,\u201d said McCaul, a leading proponent of Ukraine aid in Congress.\n\nTrump said at a news conference in early January that Putin sought to meet with him during the transition, but he did not think it would be appropriate to take the Russian leader up on the offer until after he had taken office.\n\n\"He can't be thrilled, he's not doing so well. I mean, he's grinding it out, but most people thought that war would've been over in about one week and now you're into three years,\" Trump told reporters assembled in the Oval Office on Monday evening, hours after he was sworn in to his second term. \"So he can't be thrilled, it's not making him look very good.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, July 16, 2018. Reuters photographer Kevin Lamarque: \"Body language can give an ordinary photo much more meaning, and here, Trump and Putin did not disappoint.\" REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque SEARCH \"TRUMP POY\" FOR FOR THIS STORY. SEARCH \"REUTERS POY\" FOR ALL BEST OF 2018 PACKAGES. TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY.\n\nPreparations for a meeting are underway, Trump national security adviser Michael Waltz told ABC News earlier this month.\n\n\u201cFrom President Trump's perspective, you can't enter a deal if you don't have some type of relationship and dialogue with the other side,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we will absolutely establish that in the coming months.\u201d\n\nIt is not entirely clear how soon the leaders plan to meet or where they would even do so. The leaders met in Helsinki the first time Trump was in office. Finland has since joined NATO and sided with Ukraine in the war.\n\nA source familiar with the discussions that are taking place said Trump\u2019s special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, was likely to meet with Putin's government first.\n\nBefore sanctions and other measures are put in place there has to be dialogue, the person said, and so far, Kellogg's conversations have been limited to Ukraine and the Europeans.\n\nKellogg postponed a trip he planned to make to Kyiv until after the inauguration. He did not respond to a request for comment but told Fox News during an interview in early January that he had a personal goal of wrapping the war up in 100 days.\n\nZelenskyy has said he planned to meet with Trump after the inauguration although it was not clear when. The pair have been in regular communication over the last few months, speaking by phone after the election and meeting in September on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Zelenskyy and Trump held talks in December while they were in Paris.\n\nIn an interview published in January with podcaster Lex Fridman, the Ukrainian president said it is \u201cnaive\u201d to think that Putin wants to finish the war and Trump would have to pressure him to stop it. Zelenskyy said that he struck a ceasefire agreement with Putin in 2019 that Russia eventually violated after ignoring his phone calls.\n\nTrump will be in the same situation as he was, Zelenskyy said, unless the U.S. offers serious security guarantees to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cToday (Putin is) afraid of Trump. But once Trump manages, for example, to do a ceasefire deal without serious security guarantees for Ukraine, he will give a pass to Putin,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cHe does not want that. I believe in what he says. But he will give Putin an opportunity, because in Putin\u2019s head, he wants me to fight with Trump.\u201d\n\n'Dictators do not go on vacation': Zelenskyy takes an apparent dig at Congress over military aid\n\nAt a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, in what appeared to be Zelenskyy's first public remarks about Trump since the U.S. leader returned to office, the Ukrainian president questioned whether Trump was committed to NATO and European security more generally.\n\n\"Will President Trump even notice Europe? Does he see NATO as necessary? And will he respect EU institutions?\" Zelenskyy asked an audience of leaders and global opinion shapers.\n\nHe didn't attempt to answer his own question.\n\nPutin is demanding that Ukraine be prohibited from ever joining NATO and continues to demand that Ukraine withdraw from territory that it has annexed, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst said.\n\n\u201cWhat Trump has put out there, while I think it's not wonderful, it's also not a disaster if European troops are willing to serve in between the two forces to enforce peace. That's pretty close to a security guarantee,\u201d said Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\n\nHerbst said he believes the Europeans can be persuaded into such an agreement if they are offered their own security guarantees from the United States.\n\n\u201cI think Trump does not want to think about this right now, but if this became essential to get the deal, he may and that is: if the Russians start shooting at the Europeans, and Europeans shoot back, the Americans are also shooting back.\u201d\n\nO'Brien, the former Trump national security adviser, said, \u201cYou\u2019d have security guarantees that are more than a scrap of paper and less than full NATO membership.\"\n\nThose could include having British and European forces on the ground. \u201cThere are significant security guarantees to get the Ukrainians what they need and protects Ukraine that are short of NATO membership. I don\u2019t think NATO membership is the magic wand here for Ukraine,\" O'Brien said.\n\nA senior European defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue where there appears to be some division among allies about Trump's ideas for Ukraine, said there is no scenario where a Russia-Ukraine peace deal where the latter is forced to give up territory represents \"the best solution to the war.\"\n\nThe official said western allies should \"never approve\" an agreement that sees Ukraine cede its territory to Russia, that Putin needs to be held accountable for war crimes committed in Ukraine and also pay financial reparations for damages and losses to Ukrainian infrastructure sustained during the war.\n\n\"The only good and long-term sustainable solution is a full victory for Ukraine,\" the official said. The official added that if Trump's peace plan means the conflict is \"frozen\" \u2212 armed conflict is brought to an end, but there's no peace treaty or other resolving political framework \u2212 it would simply allow Russia's military to regroup and relocate, including closer to other parts of Europe where more countries would be threatened.\n\nThe official added that the most important issue for Ukraine now is how to get it in the strongest possible position vis-a-vis Russia and to compel Putin to negotiate.\n\n\"This is the most critical part,\" the official said, \"and it is still unsolved.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Trump threatens Russia with sanctions in attempt to end Ukraine war"

The Nifty 50 was up 0.6% at close on Wednesday. Macrotech Developers dropped 6.1%, whereas Oberoi Realty , Sobha, Prestige Estates Projects and Godrej Properties were down over 5% on Wednesday.\"After Covid, the real estate sector had seen supernormal growth, and due to this high base and a recent normalisation in growth, the stocks have fallen,\" said George Thomas, fund manager-equity, Quantum AMC. \"The market had extrapolated the growth due to which most stocks had reached high valuations which are now coming off.\"In 2024, all Nifty Realty index stocks, barring Mahindra Lifespaces, jumped 14-65%. All stocks in the sector gained 17-154% in 2023. The benchmark realty index soared 81% and 34% in 2023 and 2024, respectively.\"The real estate sector has seen some profit booking after it outperformed the markets last year,\" said Sunny Agrawal, head of fundamental research at SBICaps Securities. \"Valuations have been steep across the board and with this correction, especially in midcaps and smallcaps, there is now some valuation comfort in this segment.\"Agrawal said investors could buy afresh based on the third quarter results and looking at regionwise trends in real-estate. He said that Sunteck Realty , which has posted strong results, is likely to see a recovery soon. Lodha is also attractive after the recent fall, said Agrawal. DLF and Prestige are also among his favoured picks.The worst of the recent sell-off may not be over yet. \u201cWe believe that there is some more room for correction in this sector before valuations turn attractive for investors again,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cInvestors may also keep a note of the launches, which have been neutral recently, as any new projects may trigger some upside in these stocks.\u201dThe Nifty Realty index has dropped 18% so far in 2025 as against 2.1% decline in the Nifty.Analysts prefer companies that cater to the premium segment for now as the economic slowdown could slow demand in the lower-income groups.\u201cPremiumisation in this sector was seen in the last few months as it was a segment not impacted by Covid, but it is not a perpetual trend and we may see companies providing middle-range and affordable housing doing well in the future,\u201d said Thomas.Thomas said inventory levels across key markets continue to be reasonable at less than 18 months of sales. He estimates the shares to do well once valuations are in line with the growth."

PHOTO: AFP\n\nDAVOS, Switzerland - As Donald Trump appeared on giant screens at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the world\u2019s rich and powerful rapturously applauded and snapped photos of the US leader. But by the end, the crowd had mixed feelings.\n\nExecutives, diplomats and officials stood in a long line like fans at a rock concert to pack into the main hall of the WEF\u2019s congress centre in the Swiss ski resort.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the room was listening with rapt attention. He\u2019s been the talk of the week without any question,\u201d said Mr Daniel Signorelli, a skincare company executive.\n\n\u201cSome of the things he said were just not true. But at the same time, there were kernels of truth in some of it. I think everyone\u2019s kind of taking a wait-and-see approach,\u201d he told AFP after the address.\n\n\u201cIt shows one reason why he won the election, which is he speaks forcefully, you may not agree with everything, but he speaks with a great deal of force,\u201d said Mr Stuart Eizenstat, a former US ambassador to the European Union who is now working for a law firm.\n\nSome attendees were fiercely critical but refused to comment or would only speak to AFP on condition of anonymity.\n\nOne American businessman said it was a \u201cdisaster. He seems to have completely bought all of the misinformation surrounding him. It\u2019s scary\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, another attendee cried \u201cGod help us\u201d as he left.\n\n\u2018Special day\u2019\n\nHalf an hour before the speech, a long queue began forming, which one Indian businessman said he had only seen twice before in the 30 years he had been coming to the forum - both times for Trump\u2019s speeches in 2018 and 2020.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s special,\u201d said a security officer, adding that \u201cwe had to have reinforcements\u201d.\n\nAnother room was also set up to commandeer more of the curious to watch elsewhere.\n\nMr Trump amused the audience when he mentioned that Saudi Arabia planned to invest US$600 billion (S$800 billion) in the United States but he would ask Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to \u201cround it out\u201d to US$1 trillion.\n\nThe laughter in the room angered Amnesty International head Agnes Callamard. \u201cThe business community has absolutely fallen in love with what he is offering,\u201d she said.\n\nEurope \u2018hears\u2019 Trump\n\nA quirk of the calendar meant that this year\u2019s gathering started on the same day as Mr Trump\u2019s inauguration, after which he signed a flurry of executive orders.\n\nSpeaking from the White House behind a lectern with the presidential seal and an image of an eagle at his side, Mr Trump reeled off the list of actions he has taken already.\n\nThose in the packed hall included former US secretary of state John Kerry and World Trade Organisation chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, as well as European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and International Monetary Fund managing director Kristalina Georgieva.\n\nWith a president strongly pushing an America first approach to trade back in the White House, his threats to slap tariffs on allies has been high on the agenda.\n\nHe repeated his warnings, telling businesses to make their products in the United States to benefit from the lowest taxes, or face a tariff.\n\nHe also accused Europe of treating the US \u201cvery, very unfairly\u201d.\n\nNorwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide, whose country belongs to the European Economic Area including the EU, defended free trade.\n\n\u201cBut we hear what he\u2019s saying and now there will be discussions here in the EU and in the European Economic Area that I belong to and also in the World Trade Organisation, how we deal with this strong message on tariffs,\u201d he said.

Now, Google has bought part of HTC Vive's engineering team, HTC Vive of course having ample experience engineering VR headsets.\n\nGoogle says this handover of engineers is \"subject to customary closing conditions\" and emphasises that they are \"an incredibly strong technical team with a proven track record in the VR space, and we are looking forward to working with them to accelerate the development of the Android XR platform across the headsets and glasses ecosystem.\"\n\nWith Android XR, Google is intending to \"create a vibrant ecosystem of developers and device makers for Android XR.\" The OS itself should enable you to do all the kinds of MR (mixed reality) things that got people so initially hyped over the Vision Pro.\n\nGoogle explains: \"You can fill the space around you with apps and content, and with Gemini, our AI assistant, you can even have conversations about what you're seeing or control your device. Gemini can understand your intent, helping you plan, research topics and guide you through tasks.\"\n\nPlus, you know, all the usual 'watch videos on a giant screen that's not really there' business\u2014which I'd love to hate but can't help but quietly covet.\n\nYouTube Watch On\n\nGoogle's not a stranger to the industry, although it's been a decade since its first attempt at smart glasses was abandoned, and its later Google Glass reboot ended in 2023. Hype for XR\u2014especially for AR\u2014does seem to be hotting up, after all, with projects like Meta's Orion offering a glimpse of an increasingly digitally enmeshed future.\n\nThough with Android XR it's teaming up with Samsung for what is our first glimpse of actual hardware. Project Moohan is the name, and XR is the game.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWith Android XR, all signs point to Google looking to compete with Meta on on the XR ecosystem front.\n\nMeta's Horizon VR operating system is included on its Quest headsets, such as the Quest 3. Though that's all changing soon. Soon it will be available to third parties\u2014it looks like Asus will be the first third-party manufacturer to use it.\n\nMuch in the same way that different Android device manufacturers must cede to the Google Play Store, Meta Horizon becoming the default OS for third-party VR and MR headsets and glasses could mean such device manufacturers needing to cede to a Horizon OS store.\n\nVirtual reality (Image credit: Valve) Best VR headset: which kit should you choose?\n\nBest graphics card: you need serious GPU power for VR\n\nBest gaming laptop: don't get tied to your desktop in VR\n\nIn other words, it's possible that Meta could become to the VR ecosystem what Google is to the Android ecosystem, and Horizon being open to third-party devices is a step in this direction.\n\nIt's powerful to have your store at the centre of the \"next computing platform\", if that is how you feel about mixed reality. Meta definitely feels this way, it's said so.\n\nGoogle might be pushing along similar lines here, hoping to compete in the VR OS/store ecosystem space. Talk of a \"vibrant ecosystem of developers and device makers\" certainly leans in this direction, as does Android XR's partnership with Qualcomm in particular\u2014standalone VR headsets tend to use Arm chips such as Snapdragons from Qualcomm.\n\nWho knows, maybe the next few years will see Meta and Google vying for proprietary ecosystem adoption across the VR space. Interesting times ahead."

            "article_content": "\u20b9\n\n\u20b9\n\nShares of Cables and Wires manufacturer Polycab India Ltd. opened with gains of up to 4% on Thursday, January 23, after multiple brokerages reiterated their positive outlook on the stock post its December quarter results.Despite Polycab's rough start to 2025, with the stock down 15% year-to-date, majority of the Street continues to remain bullish on the stock. Over 65% of the 32 analysts that have coverage on the company have a 'Buy' recommendation on the counter, while seven of them have a 'Hold' rating and four say 'Sell'.Consensus price targets on Polycab suggest a further upside of another 27.5% on the stock from Wednesday's closing levels. Among analysts, Jefferies currently has a price target of \u20b99,200 on Polycab, which is the highest on the Street, implying a potential upside of 50% from Wednesday's close.Brokerage firm Jefferies, which also has a 'Buy' rating on the stock, said that Polycab reported strong Q3 results with consolidated sales and EBITDA growing over 20% and 26% year-on-year, respectively.While cables demand was healthy in Q3, wires slackened due to softening of copper price and high channel inventory at start of Q3.Operating profit margins (OPM) rose to 13.8% (+70 basis points year-on-year, +230 basis points quarter-on-quarter), driven by margin normalisation in Cables & Wires (C&W) and reduced losses in the FMEG segment.Other non-operating income declined by 65% year-on-year, leading to lower profit growth of 11% year-on-year, broadly in line with Jefferies' estimates.The management has provided healthy guidance for next five years:- Capex to range between \u20b96,000 crore to \u20b98,000 crore- Wires and cables margin to be between 11% to 13%- FMEG EBITDA to be between 8% and 10%- Dividend payout to be over 30%- Exports to contribute more than 10% of the total businessUBS too has a 'Buy' rating on Polycab, with a price target of9,000 per share. The brokerage said that the cable and wire topline growth of 12% drove miss on topline. This was led by slowing government capex and should recover with rebound in government capex.FMEG segment saw sequential reduction in loss (PBIT margins at 3% as against 6.4% in Q2).Citi has maintained a 'Buy' rating on Polycab, with a price target of \u20b98,600, naming it their top pick.Revenue grew 20% on-year, slightly missing Citi's estimate by 2%, but EBITDA rose 26% on-year, surpassing estimates by 15%. The strong EBITDA performance was driven by better-than-expected margins in the Wires & Cables segment and reduced losses in the FMEG business.Wires & Cables margins improved 119bps QoQ (-56bps YoY) to 13.5%, supported by-- Margin normalisation in wires, and- Increased contributions from international business, which rose to 8.3% (compared to 6.2% in Q3FY24 and 6.1% in Q2FY25).- Management expects export momentum to continue into Q4FY25.Another brokerage house Macquarie has an 'Outperform' rating on Polycab, with a price target of7,928 per share.Their strategic outlook implies 15% revenue CAGR for FY25-30. Polycab reported Q3 revenue of \u20b95,200 crore (+20% YoY) and EBITDA of \u20b9720 crore (+26% YoY), both in line with estimates.Key positive surprise, as per the brokerage, was better than expected C&W segment margins, which expanded 120bps QoQ (down 50bps YoY) to 13.5%, driven by better margins in wires and higher share of export revenue QoQ. Profit grew 11% on-year.Shares of Polycab are currently trading 1.27% higher on Thursday at \u20b96,242.60. This stock has gained over 50% in the last one year."

(Youtube/CBS47 KSEE24)\n\nShe pointed out the profile of his work colleague Bob and said he had been Nathan's biological father all along, and they'd already been working together for a couple of years by this point.\n\nSpeaking to CBS, Bob explained that he got a message from Nathan over Facebook asking if he knew his biological mother and he said that she'd been his ex-wife.\n\nAdvert\n\nYou can probably see where this is going.\n\nBob had two other children with his former wife, but had given Nathan up for adoption was a 'difficult' decision caused by financial difficulty.\n\n\"Back then I wasn't much of a dad, his biological mom had chosen the adoptive parents,\" Bob explained of the family connection.\n\n\"Because they were somewhat related, distant cousins I believe. But I didn't know that.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"It's still kind of a shock, there's days I'm not sure exactly what to say or how to act, he is my son but we didn't have that father son relationship growing up, we became working partners before we knew what we really were.\"\n\nNathan said that he was taking the revelation that a man he'd been working with for two years was his biological father 'one day at a time'.\n\nConsidering they turned out to be pretty similar and even ended up working at the same place, it would point towards some evidence that family members can live incredibly similar lives even if they don't know each other.\n\nAdvert\n\nCompare Nathan and Bob's story to that of the 'Jim twins', identical twins separated at birth and adopted by different families who went on to lead almost identical lives.\n\nThey even named their dogs the same, each married two women with the same names, drove the same car and liked the same kind of beer.\n\nPerhaps there's more to all of this than meets the eye."

            "article_content": "Scientists have made a puzzling discovery to do with the Earth's geology.\n\nWhen you think of the highest peak in the world, you instantly think of Mount Everest in the Himalayas, standing at over 8,840m high.\n\nTrekking to its summit has become the goal of many adrenaline junkies, and can be one of the most physically taxing journeys that a human can make.\n\nAdvert\n\nBut what if I were to tell you that there are mountains that exist on our great planet that are over 100 times taller?\n\nThey're not exactly hiding in plain sight, but scientists have discovered two peaks that are continent-sized, putting mountains like Everest and K1 to shame.\n\nYou can find the structures beneath the Earth's surface (Edward Garnero; S. W. French, B. A. Romanowicz, Geophys. J. Int. 199, 1303, 2014.)\n\nResearchers from Utrecht University have found in a study that there are two colossal peaks that reach heights of around 620 miles (1,000), in what have been described as 'islands'.\n\nAdvert\n\nThey can be found about 1,200 miles (2,000km) below the Earth's crust, and are said to be at least half a billion years old.\n\nIt is suggested that they could be a more significant part of our history, dating back to the formation of our planet, four billion years ago.\n\nDespite the theory that they are mountains, lead scientist Dr Arwen Deuss explained: \"Nobody knows what they are, and whether they are only a temporary phenomenon, or if they have been sitting there for millions or perhaps even billions of years.\"\n\nSitting in the boundary between the Earth's core and mantle, it can be found in the semi-solid area beneath the crust that's under Africa and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAdvert\n\nIn a similar area is a number of sunken tectonic plates, that have been pushed below the surface over time in something called 'subuction'.\n\nThe researchers further found that these islands are a lot hotter than the surrounding slabs of the Earth's crust, and are much older - by millions of years.\n\nDue to the effects of shockwaves from earthquakes on the planet's interior, there are large structures that are hidden below the Earth's mantle.\n\nThey can be found in the mantle (Getty Stock Photo)\n\nAdvert\n\n\n\n\n\nThese waves are slowed and weakened when they pass through something dense or hot, so by listening to the 'tone' that comes out of the other side of the planet during an earthquake, scientists can map out what's below the surface.\n\nStudies have revealed over the years that there are two huge regions of the mantle where shockwaves slow down substantially, which have been affectionately called the Large Low Seismic Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs).\n\nDr Deuss explained: \"The waves slow down because the LLSVPs are hot, just like you can't run as fast in hot weather as you can when it's colder.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nCo-researcher Dr Sujania Talavera-Soza added: \"Just like when the weather is hot outside and you go for a run, you don\u2019t only slow down but you also get more tired than when it is cold outside.\"\n\nWhen the tone of waves seem out of tune or quieter as they pass through LLSVPs, it is called damping.\n\nBut Dr Talavera-Soza revealed: \"Against our expectations, we found little damping in the LLSVPs, which made the tones sound very loud there,\n\n\"But we did find a lot of damping in the cold slab graveyard, where the tones sounded very soft.\"\n\nA diagram depicting how the 'mountains' appear in the mantle (Utrecht University)\n\nThe results point towards these mountains being made of larger grains that the surrounding slabs, as they don't absorb as much energy when waves pass through.\n\n\"Those mineral grains do not grow overnight, which can only mean one thing: LLSVPs are lots and lots older than the surrounding slab graveyards,\" Dr Talavera-Soza further explained.\n\nThe idea that these could be anywhere from 500 million to four billion years old goes against the belief that the mantle is constantly moving.\n\nIt was previously believed that the mantle would be mixed by these currents, but if structures - potentially billions of years old - have not been disrupted or moved by 'mantle convection', then it shows that it isn't mixed at all."
