        "article_content": "You would think if anything could break through the noise of our news cycle, UFOs could.\n\nThis needs to be a bigger deal folks because the American people, nay people of the world, need this right now.\n\nLast week, for the second time in two years, there was a Congressional subcommittee hearing on UFOs, or as they have been foolishly rebranded \u201cunidentified anomalous phenomena,\u201d shortened to UAPs.\n\nOne of the visionaries helping uncover the truth is none other than Wisconsin Congressman Glenn Grothman, R-Fond du Lac, who chairs the House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs.\n\nEditorial:Hovde's election claims are false. He's blaming Milwaukee \u2013 without evidence.\n\nLast week\u2019s hearing, \"Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth,\" including a new slate of witnesses that provided testimony about UFO sightings and what the government may or may not know about them. One witness, Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence officer, went so far to say, \"Excessive secrecy has led to grave misdeeds against loyal civil servants, military personnel and the public, all to hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.\"\n\nAlien spacecraft and dead extraterrestrials now in Congressional Record\n\nLast year\u2019s testimony included former Pentagon official, David Grusch, telling a Congressional committee that he\u2019d learned of a decades-long Pentagon program focused on \u201ccrash retrieval and reverse engineering\u201d of UFOs from other planets. Grusch also said that remains found at the spacecraft crash sites were \u201cnon-human biologics.\u201d\n\nYes, crashed alien spacecraft and dead extraterrestrials made it to the Congressional Record.\n\nHowever, neither in the aftermath of last year's and last week's hearing did the terms \"UFO\" \"Alien\" \"UAP\" or even \"government cover up\" break the 25 most searched terms in Google Trends.\n\nWhat were people searching for last week? Would it surprise you if I said: \"mike tyson jake paul fight.\"\n\nTo be fair, neither of these hearings has provided real evidence to prove UFOs or UAPs are extraterrestrial in nature. But the collection of testimony indicates that UAPs are very real in the sense there are a number of some as-yet-unexplained phenomenal.\n\nAnd yet, apparently, most of us do not care enough to let that information even make a blip on our news cycle.\n\nAll the more reason that right now is the right time for these tight lipped folks in defense and intelligence departments, whose jobs could very well be on the chopping block anyways in Trump's administration, to just let it rip.\n\nDeclassify everything. Tell us the truth is out there. Then send Biden and Trump out to do a tag team Bill Pullman-Independence Day-esque speech, where they encourage us to not be consumed by our petty differences and instead be united in our common interests. Give us a new enemy!\n\nOr at the very least, declassify everything just to remind humans of our standing in the universe. I don't know who said it first but right now feels like a good time for everyone to remember that we\u2019re, \"just ghosts driving meat coated skeletons made from stardust riding a rock floating through space.\"\n\nKristin Brey is the \"My Take\" columnist for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel."

Kosloski of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, will testify before the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities on Tuesday (Nov. 19) starting at 4:30 p.m. ET (2130 GMT). A closed-door session off-limits to the public will be held prior to the open session, beginning at 3:15 p.m. ET (2015 GMT).\n\nYou can watch the hearing live at Space.com, courtesy of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nAARO's logo in front of the Pentagon. AARO's Latin motto translates roughly as \"the universe is changing/our life is what our thoughts make of it.\" (Image credit: AARO/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe Department of Defense created AARO in July 2022 in order to serve as a \"focal point for all UAP and UAP-related activities and may represent the Department for such activities,\" the Pentagon said at the time, in a statement.\n\nAARO has already released its 2024 report, which covers sightings of UFOs (or UAP, as they're now known) between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024 as well as \"all UAP reports from any previous time periods that were not included in an earlier report.\"\n\nThe document states that AARO received 757 total case reports during the period, 485 of which fell within the reporting timeframe. Of these cases, 118 were solved and another 174 are slated for closure pending a final review.\n\nStill, many cases remain unsolved, and AARO continues to study them.

So if there is no 'there' there, then why are we spending money on it? And by how much? Why the secrecy?\""

        "article_content": "Advertisement\n\nTwinMind, founded by former Google X employees, is building an AI assistant to better understand you.\n\nThe founders believe memory is key and something that rival products like OpenAI's ChatGPT lack.\n\nThe startup said it has raised over $2.5 million and was most recently valued at $30 million.\n\nA startup formed by a handful of former Googlers \u2014 specifically Google X, the skunkworks lab that explores sci-fi moonshot ideas \u2014 is coming out of stealth.\n\nNamed TwinMind, its app would function as an AI assistant that lives in your smartphone and always listens. Its founders like to compare it to Jarvis, the AI designed by Marvel's Tony Stark: It's constantly learning what you're doing and talking about and then uses that information to better understand you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwinMind founder and CEO Daniel George said the company raised over $2.5 million this year in two rounds, the latest giving TwinMind a $30 million post-money valuation. Notable investors to date include Oracle's chief AI scientist, Dan Roth; a Rocketship VC founding partner, Anand Rajaraman; and Michael Liou, an early investor in Robinhood and Zapier.\n\nTwinMind is emerging into a competitive market filled with chatbots galore. George told Business Insider he believes the idea of an AI assistant that learns and retains information about users could help set TwinMind apart.\n\nWhile other AI assistants and chatbots, such as Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, are improving at memory, they're still not very good at it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If you had your own Jarvis, why would you Google? Why would you ask ChatGPT?\" George told BI. \"None of these other tools capture you. None of them understand you. They don't understand what's happening in your life.\"\n\nTwinMind would run in the background of your phone, store audio in the short term, and transcribe it to text, which would go into TwinMind's memory bank. Then, users could open the app and see a readout of their day broken down into key moments.\n\nYou could also ask it questions. Because TwinMind is learning about you, what you've done, and the people you've spent your day with, it aims to pull all that information in, allowing you to talk to TwinMind in a way that feels more natural and without having to add heaps of context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup is also rolling out a web browser extension, which (with permission) could see what users are browsing online and capture it in memory. By integrating calendars and Gmail, users could also ask TwinMind to draft emails. That's something you can already do with other chatbots, of course, but TwinMind's edge here would be drawing on all that memory it holds of the user, George said.\n\n\"You just go in there and, say, write your marketing email. And it knows everything about me, who my cofounders are, what my company is, what we have done before,\" said George. \"Imagine Grammarly, but instead of correcting grammar, it actually writes it based on all the memories and context.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nWolverine origins\n\nAt Google X, George was the first machine-learning scientist working on Wolverine, a hearing-wearable project first reported on by Business Insider in 2021. That project has since spun out into a startup named Iyo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched in late 2022, George was working at JPMorgan with TwinMind cofounder and chief technology officer Sunny Tang, a Google X alum.\n\nHe said the two watched as colleagues started using AI chatbots in meetings. The pair hacked together a crude chatbot of their own that could transcribe meetings and answer questions about what was being said. The idea evolved into the startup ThirdEar, but they changed the name to TwinMind because someone else owned the ThirdEar domain name. George said the team also felt the name didn't reflect the visual elements they were building, such as the Chrome extension.\n\nTwinMind does most of its processing locally on the phone but could connect to the cloud if it needed to answer a question or if the user wanted an improved AI experience, George said. TwinMind plans to offer a free app version with a $20-a-month tier for users who want access to more advanced large language models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNaturally, it raises some questions about privacy. George said that because TwinMind does not capture images and only transcribes the audio, it falls under the same category of assistants as Siri or Alexa.\n\nPerhaps the more impressive feat here will be on the hardware side.\n\n\"The main innovation is figuring out how to get this thing running all day, in your pocket, without draining your battery, [and with] all the Apple walled garden stuff,\" George said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the team figured it out, and the TwinMind app could run for 12 hours nonstop in the background before running out the battery.\n\nThe team has just opened its seed round, and George said they're looking to raise at least $5 million. The company is also telling potential investors about its future plans, which include making the switch between phone and desktop more seamless so that TwinMind feels more embedded in users' lives.\n\nGeorge said more than 2,000 early testers have already provided feedback, and the team plans to launch the app this week on Product Hunt. It will be available first on the iPhone and as a Chrome extension, with Android and Mac apps to follow next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are sure that in a couple of years, everyone is going to have a personalized AI companion that knows their whole life and has access to all of the world's knowledge on the internet,\" George told BI. \"And that would be the way people access information. Not through Google.\""

It\u2019s here, and it\u2019s booming. According to McKinsey, more than 70% of companies worldwide have either already deployed AI-based technology, or are seriously exploring its capabilities. That\u2019s up from just 20% in 2017. In the past year alone we\u2019ve seen incredible advancements in the AI space, particularly when it comes to generative AI and the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to compute, make predictions, generate content, and analyze large sets of data in real-time for a plethora of applications.\n\nStudies by the likes of HubSpot and IBM reveal that AI can save employees roughly 2.5 hours per day, and businesses can cut their overall costs by almost a third. An entire ecosystem of partners and complementary services is now being formed around AI, and its reach isn\u2019t just confined to business. ChatGPT users can now have live conversations with AI; Meta\u2019s Llama 3.2 update allows its AI assistant to read and comment on images, and Apple Intelligence is about to leave beta and allow users to do everything from generate code to create new graphics, all with technology they can carry in their pockets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe technology is soaring, but like a busy road with too much traffic, there\u2019s always a bottleneck. AI adoption is off the charts, business ambition is strong, but do we have the connectivity infrastructure to meet the low-latency needs of new AI applications? The traffic is coming; perhaps it\u2019s time to turn our attention to the roads.\n\nThe invisible hurdle\n\nAttitudes to AI are largely positive, but part of that is down to novelty. One metric that truly matters, return on investment (ROI), is still proving elusive for most business AI deployments. Three-quarters of enterprises have not moved beyond \u201cbaby steps\u201d, that is one or two pilot projects (MIT Technology Review). And, although 50% of those surveyed expect to deploy AI at scale across all business functions within two years, they reported implementation challenges and bottlenecks \u2013 not due to capital, culture or lack of expertise, but in the infrastructure carrying their data.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear. These aren\u2019t just teething troubles. Short-term hiccups at the start of the project are to be expected, but the underlying implementation challenges enterprises have highlighted point to a more fundamental, structural issue with the feasibility of AI roll-outs.\n\nUnderperforming AI is bad for business, and not just in the sense that it won\u2019t realize its ROI, but because its insights and other outputs are limited. This happens when AI systems struggle to access and interpret data across the organization in real-time. The full potential of AI can only be realized when organizations have the right infrastructure in place to support its implementation. One critical aspect often overlooked is the importance of network interconnection. Here\u2019s how this plays out within a typical enterprise.\n\nCloud and AI \u2013 a winning combination\n\nCloud computing plays a crucial role in AI implementation. Partly in response to the accelerating pace of data generation meaning that on-premise data storage is becoming unviable and partly because of the many accessibility benefits of storing raw and structured data in the cloud, businesses are increasingly migrating data lakes and warehouses to the cloud, enabling scalability and access to vast computing power. The AI Infrastructure Alliance showed that 38% of organizations had their AI infrastructure fully set up in the cloud, while 29% operate a hybrid environment.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThese organizations rated the availability of cost and computing power as the number one challenge when scaling AI and their number one computing concern was latency (28%). A similar picture emerges across different territories, too. For example, a joint survey of European organizations by DE-CIX and IDC highlighted network performance and latency (22%) as the main concern, especially when AI use cases require real-time data.\n\nThe connectivity conundrum\n\nLet\u2019s consider how organizations typically use AI. Firstly, they need to train AI models, either first-time development or the periodic retraining that models need from time to time. For this, latency is not such a big issue, but high bandwidth connectivity is critical. In the cloud, it is best to use the cloud provider\u2019s own connectivity solution (such as Microsoft ExpressRoute or AWS Direct Connect), accessible from a range of cloud exchanges, to avoid costly overheads for data egress. Secondly, they need AI to work in real-time, which is where latency does matter. Many use cases fall into this category, from customer services bots to product support where real-time interaction is desirable right through to where it is critical, such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and some financial services use cases. Here, the AI models need real-time access to data sources, as well as to the intended users of the insights and AI agents for different services and workloads.\n\nIn short, AI needs both high bandwidth and low latency network performance. Oh, and did we mention this all needs to be seamless?\n\nThe missing link is interconnection\n\nHere is when the network performance bottleneck becomes apparent. Too many enterprises still rely on public internet or third-party transit for connecting data and AI systems. This creates considerable performance and security issues, with enterprises having little or no control over data pathways, network bandwidth and latency, and the security of critical company data in transit.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTo control data flows, enterprises need to control how networks interconnect with each other. That\u2019s why increasingly organizations are choosing network interconnection solutions, which provide secure, dedicated connections between on-premise systems and cloud-based AI services. By establishing direct, high-performance links, businesses ensure control over performance, security, and data routing. In practice, this network interconnection creates responsive, interoperable environments for cloud and multi-cloud scenarios, enabling low-latency access to AI-as-a-service offerings and real-time data analysis. It assures secure data exchange within partner ecosystems and improves the overall resilience of the cloud infrastructure environment, enabling business to roll out AI implementations at scale that deliver their intended ROI.\n\nEnterprises need AI-ready infrastructure\n\nAI offers organizations unprecedented opportunities to transform their operations and revenue generation. The awe-inspiring capabilities of AI models and data analytics tools naturally enough garner much attention, but organizations need to ensure that the underlying infrastructure supporting AI implementations is equally scalable and resilient for AI to live up to its potential. Investing in a robust interconnection strategy alongside cloud migration is critical for businesses to overcome AI connectivity bottlenecks and truly unlock its transformative potential.\n\nPartnering with high-performance interconnection providers can help in the design of a secure, scalable network tailored to specific AI needs. The future of AI has already arrived; we just need to make sure we\u2019re ready for it.\n\nWe've featured the best IT infrastructure management service.\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Advertisement\n\nIn the more than 95 years since it was built, 272 Innisfil St. has been home to a slaughterhouse and an antique market, but according to the team from a popular YouTube series, it\u2019s also home to several ghosts.\n\nRaif Boric and Krista Maryk, who make up two-thirds of the paranormal investigative team of Walking Among Us, spent three hours inside the 25,000-square-foot building near Essa Road earlier this month after they heard of some of the not-so-normal things that have taken place there.\n\nShirley Sanford, owner of Sanford and Son Emporium which is located inside the building, told BarrieToday the team came for a visit on Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cOne of my employees was talking to one of the customers and something was brought up about the spirits that are in that building,\" she said. \"The woman said she knew some people that do the paranormal thing, so she asked if it would be OK if they phone me.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to see what was going on.\u201d\n\nIn the five years that she\u2019s been in the building, Sanford said she\u2019s seen plenty of \u201cunexplainable\u201d things take place.\n\n\u201cAbout three weeks ago, I was up in a booth. Everybody had left and I was doing my rounds at night for closing,\" she said. \"I went into this booth and was looking to see what new things they\u2019d brought in. I could hear a woman and a man's voice \u2026 I thought maybe there was a radio in the booth and it was on low and they\u2019d forgotten to turn it off, but there was no radio.\u201d\n\nSanford poked around a little more, but couldn\u2019t find any source for the noise. And despite being late and alone, she wasn\u2019t fearful.\n\nThe next week while doing her closing routine, Sanford said an Elvis clock started singing.\n\n\u201cThere is an Elvis clock hanging on the wall \u2026 so I thought OK, it\u2019s a motion-sensor thing. I went into the booth and I was singing and dancing and then all of a sudden it shut off,\" she said. \"I went back and forth three times that night into where I had triggered it and nothing.\n\nShirley Sanford is the owner of Sanford and Sons Emporium on Innisfil Street in Barrie. | Nikki Cole/BarrieToday files\n\n\"The next morning when I came into work, I went to try it and nothing. I pulled the clock off the wall and you have to push a button for it to go off,\u201d she said.\n\nShe remembers another incident which included a ladder that was found in the middle of the floor; despite the shop having been closed, it was nearby a spot where she said a man had hanged himself.\n\nThe building has been the scene of five separate deaths, Sanford told BarrieToday, including two suicides, one person who was gored by a cow, and two who were killed in a boiler-room explosion.\n\nAs for what occurred on the property prior to the building\u2019s construction in 1929, she has no idea and said it could very well play a role in the site\u2019s haunting.\n\nRaif Boric, lead investigator for Walking Among Us, said that going into their visit, they didn\u2019t know too much about the structure's history, nor were they aware of what had occurred there over the years.\n\n\u201cIt was just kind of like let\u2019s go and see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met up with Shirley \u2026 and we both went to different spots \u2026 to see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhile he was by himself with the spouse of one of the store\u2019s employees on one side of the building, he says he was drawn to a doll on a shelf, telling BarrieToday he is a collector of \u201chaunted artifacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have six haunted dolls and a haunted teddy bear at home. This doll just drew me in,\" Boric said. \"When it was time to start, I went up to the doll and set up some motion-sensored cat balls, a REM pod (which is a piece of ghost-hunting equipment that indicates changes in ambient temperature) and had my cameras going. This thing would not stop with the motion-sensored cat balls and there were noises going on all in the area,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt one point, I was standing there asking questions and we heard a little girl call out. We looked at each other like \u2018what the (heck) was that!?\u2019\u201d\n\nBoric said they went to explore where the sound came from, which is when he heard Maryk yelling from where she was in the building.\n\n\u201cWe started running back and she was where the doll was \u2026 and asked what all the banging was about,\u201d he said, adding neither he nor the employee\u2019s wife knew what his partner was talking about. \"We\u2019d just heard the kid\u2019s voice, which is where Shirley had heard disembodied voices in the area previously.\u201d\n\nBoric told BarrieToday it felt like a game of cat and mouse trying to track down the spirits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve encountered that a lot, and it sometimes gets a little annoying because you go thinking you\u2019re going to experience something and it just leads you around the building,\" he said. \u201cIt was a good experience and there was a plethora of (paranormal) activity.\"\n\nBoric ended up bringing the \u201chaunted doll\u201d home to add to his collection.\n\n\u201cI have her in the room with the other ones,\" he said. \"I am pretty sure her arm moved the other night, so I am setting up a security camera in the haunted room.\u201d\n\nSanford says she found the entire experience \u201cfascinating,\u201d adding she \"absolutely\" believes in ghosts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get scared over any of this stuff that happens. I am all for it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen these guys came in, I saw it for myself. The white orbs and the one gentleman at the very end had forgotten something upstairs \u2026 When we got up there, one of the revolving showcases was on and (it) hadn\u2019t been on 15 minutes early when we\u2019d been up there.\u201d\n\nThe episode is expected to air on the Walking Among Us YouTube channel in January 2025."

And that's all I'll say.\"\n\nThough she didn't mention the 'entity' by name, it refers to Lady Colin Campbell, who clashed with a number of campmates in 2015 due to her acerbic comments.\n\nYvette, who rarely watches TV and isn't tuning in to the current series, has mixed feelings about her own time on the show.\n\nAnd the passing years haven't changed her view of her old jungle rival.\n\n\"I don't regret it,\" said Yvette.\n\n\"I get annoyed because there was a certain person there who ruined the whole experience for me because of their negativity and their attitude, which was a real shame. But I'm glad I did it because it was a great experience.\n\n\"I mean, wow, I've never been to Australia before to go there. My eyes were just, I loved it. I thought it was absolutely brilliant.\n\nMost Haunted's spookiest moments\n\n\"So I certainly don't regret it. But would I do it again? No.\"\n\nYvette was the third celebrity to leave her series of the ITV reality show and, in her exit interview, she described Lady C as a \"sly witch\" who left campmates \"walking on eggshells\".\n\nUltimately, the programme proved a mere two-week distraction from Yvette's esteemed paranormal career.\n\nShe threw herself back into ghost hunting the following year, tackling well-known buildings like the Lyceum Theatre and HMP Shrewsbury.\n\nThough neither proved anywhere near as terrifying as her foray into Edinburgh Vaults back in 2003.\n\nThe Vaults date back to 1785 and began as a gambling and boozing den of sorts underneath the city.\n\nRumours have circulated over the years that serial killer William Burke and William Hare stashed bodies there, though this hasn't been proven.\n\nShe said: \"If you talk to anybody that's been to Edinburgh Vaults, there's a room where there's a stone circle and members of the public will go on a tour down there, and they'll come out and have scratches on their face or bruises or little burns on them.\n\n4 Yvette is considered the first lady of the paranormal Credit: PA:Press Association\n\n4 She has moved into novel writing in recent years Credit: Andersen Press\n\n\"And that's why we went to investigate Edinburgh Vaults, because we thought, well, what's going on here? And sure enough, three members of the team got scratched, but one of them so badly, down his leg, the cut was so deep you could see the bone.\n\n\"He had to be rushed off to Accident and Emergency to get it stitched up. And that's where I actually resigned live on air.\n\n\"I went into shock. I was so frightened. But we were broadcasting across America on the Discovery Channel and across the UK at the same time, and I'm trying to keep it together.\n\n\"I just keep bursting into tears, and I actually said live on air, that's it, I resign. I'm not dealing with any of this, because it's too frightening.\"\n\nHOME INVASION\n\nYvette is now using her expertise to help homeowners establish whether or not they're experiencing supernatural goings on after a raft of Ring doorbell owners spotted spooky happenings on their devices.\n\nWhile some are what you'd expect from a cheeky apparition, others are a bit more sinister and extreme.\n\nShe said: \"Oh blimey, there's so many. Hearing your doorbell ring or somebody knocking at the door and you go to open it and there's nobody there. This might happen three times in the day and you're like, what's going on?\n\n\"The next thing will be objects will just disappear like your keys or you'll be there getting ready in your bathroom and you'll be needing a hairbrush or whatever you think, where the hell's that gone? And then they'll turn up in the most ridiculous place, like your hairbrush might turn up in the cutlery drawer downstairs in the kitchen.\n\n\"Then it's noises, so you might suddenly start hearing footsteps on your staircase or voices, whispering, talking.\n\n\"And then the next thing is, will be objects moving, but heavy objects, so like chairs will suddenly appear in different rooms where they're not supposed to be or you'll hear furniture being dragged around and you'll think, oh my god, what's going on? And you'll go into that particular room where you've heard the noise from and nothing's out of place.\n\n\"Or in some really horrible cases, the furniture will be piled up, normally at one end of the room or in a pyramid, which is really bizarre. What else happens? All sorts of strange things. You'll feel like you're being watched in your own home.\n\n\"Doors will slam, that sort of thing. So it's really quite scary. When you are in that situation and you see this believing and you think, this is not my imagination, I know these things are moving on their own.\n\n\"I know I'm hearing a little girl's voice. I know I can hear footsteps running up and down the stairs and objects are being moved in my house. Then you know that you've got somebody else with you.\"\n\nRegardless of the terror she's experienced, Yvette has vowed to hunt on and even joked that she'll return to her own show as a ghost when she eventually pops her clogs."

The mosaic had an inscription at the top (pictured) that said: 'The god-loving Akeptous has offered the table to God Jesus Christ as a memorial'\n\nThe Megiddo Mosaic is currently on display at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC (pictured until July 2025\n\nAlegre Savariego, curator of the exhibition, said: 'The mosaic presents groundbreaking physical evidence of the practices and beliefs of early Christians, including the first archaeological instance of the phrase, 'God Jesus Christ.''\n\nThe Megiddo Mosaic was found in the Jezreel Valley where Christians believe the final battle of the Biblical Armageddon in the Book of Revelations will occur.\n\nThe excavation, conducted by archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), took four years to recover the 581-square-foot mosaic floor.\n\nThe mosaic included the name of the Roman officer who commissioned the tile during the Roman occupation of Judea.\n\nResearchers suggested that could prove Romans coexisted with Christians to some degree, despite the numerous stories of war and slaughter at the time.\n\nAn inscription on the mosaic read: 'Gaianus, a Roman officer, having sought honor, from his own money, has made the mosaic.'\n\nThe team also found a nearby Roman camp, providing more support of the peace between the two groups.\n\nThe prayer hall, or church, was likely abandoned and covered up because the Roman Empire's Sixth Legion was transferred to Transjordan - a region located to the east of the Jordan River.\n\nThe mosaic also contained the names of five women, highlighting the important role women played in the church.\n\nAside from Akeptous, who was mentioned for her donation of a table to the prayer hall, the mosaic's inscription also says to 'remember Primilla and Cyriaca and Dorothea, and lastly, Chreste.'\n\nBobby Duke, director of the Scholars Initiative at the Museum of the Bible, said: 'This is arguably one of the most important archaeological discoveries for understanding the early Christian church.'\n\nThe mosaic was discovered while expanding a maximum-security prison located near the ancient city of Megiddo in the Jezreel Valley in 2005\n\nThe mosaic featured some of the earliest images of fish being used to represent Christianity, mirroring the story told in Luke 9:16 when Jesus multiplied two fish to feed a crowd of 5,000 people\n\n'For example, the mosaic underscores the crucial role of women in the early church by the fact that five women are mentioned in it by name,' he continued.\n\n'Truly, the mosaic presents a wealth of new data for church historians, like the Dead Sea Scrolls did for Bible scholars.'\n\nThe IAA said there isn't any information that explains why these women were mentioned, but it is highly unusual because God wasn't typically asked to remember individuals.\n\n'While they were clearly important to the community, the inscription does not tell us whether they were patrons of the community (like Akeptous), or martyrs, or honored for some other reason,' the Museum of the Bible said.\n\nAfter the major archaeological find, the conservation department of the IAA cleaned and stabilized the mosaic, grouted and re-laid any loose tesserae and filled in the empty spaces with mortar and reburied the mosaic while they carried out their research.\n\nIAA had to separate the floor, placing pieces in 11 crates that were shipped to the US earlier this year for the exhibit titled: 'The Megiddo Mosaic: Foundations of Faith.'\n\n'You couldn't just lift the whole floor up,' Duke said.\n\n'So ... they very intricately cut different pieces of the mosaic so that they didn't destroy any of the artwork. So, not all the pieces were the same size.\n\n'So, even one of the crates that came into this gallery was about a thousand pounds.'\n\nThe Megiddo mosaic will return to Israel after the exhibit concludes and put on a permanent display at the exact site where it was discovered.\n\nThe Megiddo inmates will be relocated to another prison upon the mosaic's return.\n\nThe mosaic contained Greek inscriptions that include the names of five women, highlighting the importance of women in the church\n\nIn the year leading up to the mosaic's move to the Museum of the Bible, the IAA received criticism for allowing the a major piece of Christian history to be displayed at the museum.\n\nSince it's doors opened in 2017, the museum has been forced to return thousands of artifacts including an ancient Mesopotamian tablet and thousands of clay scrolls that were looted from Iraq.\n\nIt was also forced to admit that several of the Dead Sea Scroll fragments displayed in its collection were modern forgeries.\n\n'While some of the founders and actions of the museum are questionable, and the museum clearly has a very ideological agenda, I don't think a 'purist' agenda is very helpful here,' Prof. Aren Maeir, an archaeologist at Bar-Ilan University told Haaretz.com.\n\n'As long as everything is done by the letter of the law, I see no problem.'"

        "article_content": "\u201cIt makes it easier to take that bet,\u201d said Dan Ushman, TrendSpider\u2019s chief executive officer and founder. \u201cIt is like a second set of eyes, and that that second set of eyes is a theme we have throughout TrendSpider. It is not meant to completely replace human intuition and eyeballs, but it is meant to augment them.\u201d\n\nUshman, who also has founded Chicago-based tech startups SingleHop and Concurra, said the recent buzz around artificial intelligence will speed traders\u2019 adoption of AI Strategy Labs.\n\n\u201cThere is a super trend of moving toward machine learning, and I think it's something that there's a lot of pent-up demand for from investors,\u201d Ushman said. \u201cI think there is a lot of appetite for that type of efficiency in trading.\u201d\n\nAI Strategy Labs requires no previous experience with computer coding or artificial intelligence. It also takes emotion out of the equation, which can be a hinderance to traders working on a minute-to-minute basis.\n\n\u201cIt is done with no technical experience needed on the part of the investor,\u201d Ushman said. \u201cThey do not need a computer science degree. They do not need to even understand how machine learning works. They just select what they want to predict and what assets they want to predict it on and what data they think might be relevant and it just figures it out in the background.\u201d\n\nTrendSpider\u2019s new product puts retail investors on the same footing as traders at large firms have been on for years, leveling the playing field in the markets. The company\u2019s customer mix is 90% retail investors and 10% institutional, Ushman said.\n\n\u201cMachine learning has been obviously used in finance and investing for years, but it has been guard-railed by the need to have some serious technical chops to be able to do it,\" he said. \"I think this is the great kind of equalizer. This is a capability that was siloed in the institutions for a long time and now it is becoming available to retail investors, and that aligns with our overall mission.\u201d\n\nSmaller hedge funds, financial planners and portfolio managers also stand to benefit from AI Strategy Labs. The company is offering the product to all of its customers for the rest of the year. In 2025, it will be available to customers whose TrendSpider accounts cost between $1,200 to $3,000 per year."
