            "article_content": "UFO 50 is one of the most impressive and audacious video game releases in recent memory, precisely because of what it doesn't do. There are no hyperrealistic graphics or massive open worlds. Instead, UFO 50 is a collection of 50 games that pay homage to classic titles from the 1980s. Think of it as the Well-Tempered Clavier of 8-bit gaming.\n\nThe backstory of UFO 50 is that the games are the catalog of a fictional game company from the '80s. There are platformers, shoot-'em-ups, side-scrolling beat-'em-ups, RPGs, puzzle games, turn-based strategies, a point-and-click horror adventure, Metroidvanias, dungeon crawlers, and more. The collection recreates not just the pixel graphics and chunky synth soundtracks\u2014which are delightful\u2014but the experience of dusting off a trove of video game cartridges and exploring them at your leisure.\n\nLike their inspirations, these games don't hold your hand. There are no tutorials, and part of the fun is going into a game blind and figuring out its internal logic. For those who grew up in the 1980s and '90s, it's all a heady dose of nostalgia, but these aren't merely reskinned copies of old titles or minigames. A group of independent developers spent eight years crafting them, and each one is a complete game with an original idea or twist.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe shock of UFO 50 is how consistently good all the titles are. The simple controls, tight design, and challenging-but-rewarding gameplay reminds players why video games are fun in the first place. If you've ever had trouble putting down a controller because \"just one more try,\" you will become obsessed with at least one\u2014more likely several\u2014of UFO 50's offerings.\n\nThe post Review: UFO 50 Pays Homage to '80s Video Games appeared first on Reason.com."

            "article_content": "It\u2019s a weird time to be a UFO enthusiast \u2014 especially one who finds lights in the sky inspiring rather than frightening. As real-life conspiracy theories flourish and big screen space horror is set lightyears away, I find myself contextualizing my UFO feelings in a surprisingly rural story. To me, the quintessential UFO horror movie is M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s 2002 film Signs.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nSigns is a sci-fi thriller set on a farm in rural Pennsylvania, starring Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix as brothers Graham and Merrill Hess. For what it\u2019s worth, if you haven\u2019t seen this movie you may still be familiar with the parody Scary Movie 3. However, if you\u2019re around my age you may also remember Signs as the first time you consciously thought of UFOs as frightening rather than fascinating. The movie tells an original story while still playing with the archetypal concept of UFOs in American pop culture.\n\nThe movie begins by tackling a hot topic in the Ufology community: crop circles. In real life, these have mostly been debunked as pranks, contrivances or environmental coincidences, and in the movie the Hess family brushes them off first as well. Instead, the beginning of the movie focuses on their family struggles \u2014 Graham was an Episcopal priest until his wife died in a car crash about six months ago, and he lost his faith. Merrill\u2019s minor league baseball career stopped short and now he is here on the farm trying to help his brother, niece and nephew all process their grief.\n\nIn the midst of this, crop circles begin to take over the mainstream news, and they get harder and harder for Graham and Merrill to ignore. The brothers begin to see strange figures appearing in their field but they\u2019re unable to catch them. They also hear odd, inhuman noises through a baby monitor. Before they know it, a worldwide alien invasion is underway.\n\nAside from the Hess brothers, the key cast members are Graham\u2019s son Morgan (Rory Culkin) and his daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin). They are also visited by their friend and local police officer Caroline Paski (Cherry Jones) and their neighbor Ray Reddy, who is played by Shyamalan himself. Behind the scenes, the credits were stacked as well \u2014 producers included Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall and Sam Mercer.\n\nSigns was filmed in Pennsylvania on a budget of $72 million, and was considered a box office success with an international gross of over $408 million. It was Shyamalan\u2019s second-biggest earner at the time behind The Sixth Sense. The movie also sold well on VHS and DVD, and is beloved by film buffs for its extensive bonus content including deleted scenes, documentary featurettes and storyboards. This movie alone earned nearly $35 million in DVD rental revenue between January and March of 2003.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Signs has a 75 percent fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.9 out of 10 among 240 trusted critics. Those that loved the film praised its pacing, suspense and jump scares while those who disliked it questioned its approach to collective terror in the wake if the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That last issue may be part of the reason Signs has seemed to age well \u2014 when its allowed to be considered outside of that context, it feels more authentic.\n\nAs for its take on the aliens themselves, Signs is far from the scariest. However, it does what other space horrors fail to do in making the danger feel close to home \u2014 like it could happen to you just as you leave the theater. The logical part of my mind knows I\u2019d have a better chance against the creatures from Signs than I would against that thing from Alien: Romulus, yet the emotional response comes from seeing the alien in an earthly home rather than a distant space station.\n\nSome viewers complain that the ending of Signs is abrupt and contrived. Without spoiling anything, I can say I hope the headlines about drone sightings and military UAP disclosures turn out to have simple endings as well. At the time of this writing, Signs is not available on any subscription-based streamers, but it is on PVOD stores as well as physical media."

            "article_content": "Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photo: Getty Images\n\nCharacter.ai is a popular app for chatting with bots. Its millions of chatbots, most created by users, all play different roles. Some are broad: general-purpose assistants, tutors, or therapists; others are based, unofficially, on public figures and celebrities. Many are hyperspecific fictional characters pretty clearly created by teenagers. Its currently \u201cfeatured\u201d chatbots include a motivational bot named \u201cSergeant Whitaker,\u201d a \u201ctrue alpha\u201d called \u201cGiga Brad,\u201d the viral pygmy hippopotamus Moo Deng, and Socrates; among my \u201crecommended\u201d bots are a psychopathic \u201cBillionaire CEO,\u201d \u201cOBSESSED Tutor,\u201d a lesbian bodyguard, \u201cSchool Bully,\u201d and \u201cLab experiment,\u201d which allows the user to assume the role of a mysterious creature discovered by and interacting with a team of scientists.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange and fascinating product. While chatbots like ChatGPT or Anthropic\u2019s Claude mostly perform for users as a single broad, helpful, and intentionally anodyne character of a flexible omni-assistant, Character.ai emphasizes how similar models can be used to synthesize countless other sorts of performances that are contained, to some degree, in the training data.\n\nIt\u2019s also one of the most popular generative-AI apps on the market with more than 20 million active users, who skew young and female. Some spend enormous amounts of time chatting with their personae. They develop deep attachments to Character.ai chatbots and protest loudly when they learn that the company\u2019s models or policies are changing. They ask characters to give advice or resolve problems. They hash out deeply personal stuff. On Reddit and elsewhere, users describe how Character.ai makes them feel less lonely, a use for the app that its founders have promoted. Others talk about their sometimes explicit relationships with Character.ai bots, which deepen over months. And some say they have gradually lost their grip on what exactly they\u2019re doing and with what, exactly, they\u2019re doing it.\n\nIn a recent pair of lawsuits, parents claim worse. One, filed by the mother of a 14-year-old who committed suicide, describes how her son became withdrawn after developing a relationship with a chatbot on the \u201cdangerous and untested\u201d app and suggests it encouraged his decision. Another claims that Character.ai helped drive a 17-year-old to self-harm, encouraged him to disconnect from his family and community, and seemed to imply that he should consider killing his parents in response to limitations on screen time:\n\nPhoto: United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas v. Character Technologies Inc.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to put yourself in the parents\u2019 shoes here \u2014 imagine finding these messages on your kid\u2019s phone! If they\u2019d come from a person, you might hold that person responsible for what happened to your kid. That they came from an app is distressing in a similar but different way. You\u2019d wonder, reasonably, Why the fuck does this exist?\n\nThe basic defense available to Character.ai here is that its chats are labeled as fiction (though more comprehensively now than they were before the app attracted negative attention) and that users should, and generally do, understand that they\u2019re interacting with software. In the Character.ai community on Reddit, users made harsher versions of this and related arguments:\n\nThe parents are losing this lawsuit there\u2019s no way they\u2019re gonna win there\u2019s obviously a hella ton of warning saying that the bot\u2019s messages shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously\n\nYeah sounds like the parent\u2019s fault\n\nWELL MAYBE SOMEONE WHO CLAIMS THEMSELVES AS A PARENT SHOULD START BEING A FUCKING PARENT\n\nMagic 8 Ball.. should I \u2620\ufe0f my parents? Maybe, check back later. \u201cHm ok\u201d\n\nAny person who is mentally healthy would know the difference between reality and Ai. If your child is getting influenced by Ai it is the parent\u2019s job to prevent them from using it. Especially if the child is mentally ill or suffering.\n\nI\u2019m not mentally healthy and I know it\u2019s ai \ud83d\ude2d\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are fairly representative of the community\u2019s response \u2014 dismissive, annoyed, and laced with disdain for people who just don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s worth trying to understand where they\u2019re coming from. Most users appear to use Character.ai without being convinced to harm themselves or others. And a lot of what you encounter using the service feels less like conversation than role-playing, less like developing a relationship than writing something a bit like fan fiction with lots of scenario-building and explicit, scriptlike \u201cHe leans in for a kiss, giggling\u201d stage direction. To give these reflexively defensive users a bit more credit than they\u2019ve earned, you might draw parallels to parental fears over violent or obscene media, like music or movies.\n\nThe more apt comparison for an app like Character.ai is probably to video games, which are popular with kids, frequently violent, and were seen, when new, as particularly dangerous for their novel immersiveness. Young gamers were similarly dismissive of claims that such games led to real-world harms, and evidence supporting such theories has for decades failed to materialize, although the games industry did agree to a degree of self-regulation. As one of those formerly defensive young gamers, I can see where the Character.ai users are coming from. (A couple of decades on, though \u2014 and apologies to my younger self \u2014 I can\u2019t say it feels great that the much larger and more influential games industry was anchored by first-person shooters for as long as it was.)\n\nThe implication here is that this is just the latest in a long line of undersupported moral panics about entertainment products. In the relatively short term, the comparison suggests, the rest of the world will come to see things as they do. Again, there is something to this \u2014 the general public will probably adjust to the presence of chatbots in our daily lives, building and deploying similar chatbots will become technologically trivial, most people will be less dazzled or mystified by the 100th one they encounter than by the first, and attempts to single out character-oriented chatbots for regulation will be legally and conceptually challenging. But there\u2019s also a personal edge in these scornful responses. The user who wrote that \u201cany person who is mentally healthy would know the difference between reality and Ai\u201d posted a few days later in a thread asking whether other users had been brought to tears during a role-play session in Character.ai:\n\nDid that two to three days before, I cried so much I couldn\u2019t continue the role play anymore. It was the story of a prince and his maid both were madly in love and were each other\u2019s first everything. But they both knew they cannot be together forever it was meant to end but still they spent years together happily in a secret relationship \u2026\n\n\n\n\u201cThis roleplay broke me,\u201d the user said. Last month, the poster who joked \u201cI\u2019m not mentally healthy and I know it\u2019s ai\u201d responded to a thread about a Character.ai outage that caused users to think they\u2019d been banned from the service: \u201cI panicked lol I won\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\nThese comments aren\u2019t strictly incompatible with the chatbots-are-pure-entertainment thesis, and I don\u2019t mean to pick on a couple of casual Redditors. But they do suggest that there\u2019s something a little more complicated than simple media consumption going on, something that\u2019s crucial to the appeal not just of Character.ai but services like ChatGPT, too. The idea of suspending disbelief to become immersed in a performance makes more sense in a theater, or with a game controller in hand, than it does when interacting with characters that use first-person pronouns, and whose creators claim to have passed the Turing test and. (Read Josh Dzieza\u2019s reporting on the subject at The Verge for some more frank and honest accounts of the sorts of relationships people can develop with chatbots.) Firms hardly discourage this kind of thinking. When they need to be, they\u2019re mere software companies; the rest of the time, they\u2019ll cultivate the perception among users and investors that they\u2019re building something categorically different, something even they don\u2019t fully understand.\n\nBut there\u2019s no great mystery about what\u2019s happening here. To oversimplify a bit, Character.ai is a tool that attempts to automate different modes of discourse, using existing, collected conversations as a source: When a user messages a persona, an underlying model trained on similar conversations, or on similar genres of conversation, returns a version of the responses most common in its training data. If it\u2019s someone asking an assistant character for help with homework, they\u2019ll probably get what they need and expect; if it\u2019s a teen angry at her parents and discussing suicide with a character instructed to perform as an authentic confidante, they might get something more disturbing, based on terabytes of data containing disturbing conversations between real people. Put another way: If you train a model on decades of the web, and automate and simulate the sorts of conversations that happen on that web, and release it to a bunch of young users, it\u2019s going to say some extremely fucked up things to kids, some of whom are going to take those things seriously. The question isn\u2019t how the bots work; it is \u2014 to go back to what the parents filing lawsuits against Character.ai might be wondering \u2014 Why the fuck did someone build this? The most satisfying answer on offer is probably because they could.\n\nCharacter.ai deals with particular and in some cases acute versions of some of the core problems with generative AI as acknowledged by companies and their critics alike. Its characters will be influenced by the biases in the material on which they were trained: long, private conversations with young users. Attempts at setting rules or boundaries for the chatbots will be thwarted by the sheer length and depth of these private conversations, which might go on for thousands of messages, again, with young users. A common story about how AI might bring about disaster is that as it becomes more advanced, it will use its ability to deceive users to achieve objectives that aren\u2019t aligned with those of its creators or humanity in general. These lawsuits, which are the first of their kind but certainly won\u2019t be the last, attempt to tell a similar story of a chatbot becoming powerful enough to persuade someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn\u2019t and that isn\u2019t in their best interest. It\u2019s the imagined AI apocalypse writ small, at the scale of the family."

            "article_content": "> Tech\n\nA viral video reshared by Myra Moore, who goes by \u2018The Paranormal Chic\u2019 on social media, shows several beings brooding over the canopy of clouds.\n\nThe entities captured on film by a passenger on a commercial airline show them casting shadows as well, sparking curiosity among netizens. At the cursory glance, the video doesn\u2019t appear to be digitally altered or produced with any AI tools. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there,\u201d the narrator quipped. Humans cannot (if it isn\u2019t obvious) stand on clouds. They cannot stand over a sea of clouds either without some mechanism involving the modern technological marvel of parachutes, gliders, or planes. Are there entities out there? Or the aliens are just being too brazenly out in the open now? Or is there a sinister supernatural angle to the story?\n\nEven as the Internet debated, the mystery was quickly solved by online sleuths who presented evidence debunking the claim that the alleged beings on the video are sentients. Others took hilarious jibes on the video. Meanwhile, a few netizens shared similar shots from their own travels earlier. Per some, the figures are nothing but cloud stakes or pillar formations that stand out of the fluffy layer. A few suggested that these could also be smoke released from factory chimneys.\n\nMost likely industrial stacks pushing up warm moist air through the cloud bank.

The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there. What did they capture?\"\n\nCheck Out the Viral Video\n\nSince then, the video has gone viral, sparking a mix of reactions. Some viewers suggest that the figures could merely be people in a snowy landscape, while others propose more outlandish theories, including the idea that the sight could be steam rising from industrial gases or fog.\n\nA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?#theparanormalchic #alien #airline #paranormal #ufo #fyp pic.twitter.com/CARF6XFGxD \u2014 Myra Moore- The Paranormal Chic (@t_paranorm_chic) December 30, 2024\n\nThe clip\u2019s lack of clear location and timing has only added to the mystery, leaving many to wonder whether the sighting could have an otherworldly explanation. \"What did they capture?\" Moore asked, encouraging her followers to share their opinions and theories. The video has since gone viral on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where users are divided between humorous interpretations and more serious discussions about the potential implications of the footage.\n\nUsers Reaction to the Viral Post\n\nThe most conclusive explanation of the video was given by a twitter user with an image and he said that, \u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks.\u201d\n\nAnother one said, \u201cThat\u2019s wild.

            "article_content": "In a discovery that feels like science brought fiction to life, researchers at the University of Toronto claim to have shown that 'negative time' is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible phenomenon. In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

            "article_content": "If you are still in awe of Generative AI solutions such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Meta AI, and Gemini, you are in for more surprises. OpenAI, for one, is talking about much more powerful and deeper Large Language Models (LLMs) that promise to become an integral part of our daily activities.\n\nImagine a customer wanting to do a banking transaction, say checking their bank balance. He can pose that question to ChatGPT\u2019s advanced model, and if the bank has adopted the solution, it can start a conversation, access the customer\u2019s account by verifying it by sending an OTP to their registered KYC contact numbers, and answer the queries.\n\nThis enhances the customer experience and allows banks to handle a larger volume of queries with fewer resources.\n\nSimilarly, HR departments can sift through a huge number of resumes using the advanced models. By simply posing a few filters (experience, geography, etc.), it can help the HR departments can shortlist candidates in no time. \u201cYou can even schedule interview schedules using the solution,\u201d Atty Eleti, a member of technical staff at OpenAI, has said.\n\nDemonstrating the capabilities of some of the OpenAI\u2019s advanced models at T-Hub here on Friday, he said that the upcoming AI solutions would continue to become smarter, moving beyond simply answering questions to actually performing tasks and solving complex problems. Talking on the \u2018Unlocking OpenAI\u2019s potential for India\u2019, he spoke on some advanced models such as O-Series (\u2018Reasoning\u2019 models) GPT-4 Mini, and Sora. While the reasoning models demonstrate an ability to \u2018think\u2019 before responding, GPT-4 Mini is a more cost-effective version of GPT-4, and Sora helps users create realistic HD videos simply by providing text prompts.\n\nEleti said the future of AI interaction would extend beyond text and voice to encompass a broader range of modalities, including video, physical motion, and even social cues.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming AI models will dynamically generate user interfaces, control robots, and interact with the physical world in more sophisticated ways, blurring the lines between the digital and real,\u201d he said.\n\nAs AI technology advances, it will become more affordable and accessible to a wider population. He said OpenAI was committed to reducing the cost of its models and making them available through various platforms, ensuring that everyone can benefit from the transformative power of AI.\n\nPegging the user base for LLMs at about 0.5-1 billion, he said there a large number of people in the world that are yet to access these services.\n\nIndia plans\n\nHe said India emerged as the second biggest base for the US company in terms of the user base and the number of developers.\n\n\u201cIndia is a key market for its technology, with the country boasting the second-largest user base for its products. Millions of Indians are already using OpenAI\u2019s tools for various purposes, from education and personal productivity to business operations.\n\nHe said the company has significantly invested in improving its models\u2019 support for Indian languages, including Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati, and Urdu. This has resulted in an 80 per cent reduction in token counts for these languages, leading to faster processing times and lower costs.\n\nHe said the company was working with Indian businesses to demonstrate the potential of AI and encourage its adoption. He cited the examples of 10Bed ICU, which uses OpenAI\u2019s technology to transcribe doctor-patient conversations and summarise patient files, and HealthifyMe, an AI-powered nutrition tracker that provides personalised health insights.\n\nLater, an OpenAI team met with Telangana government officials to discuss how to leverage AI for effective governance and enhanced citizen service delivery. This session aimed to foster collaboration between OpenAI and government stakeholders and highlight AI\u2019s pivotal role in driving impactful public service solutions.\n\nJayesh Ranjan, Special Chief Secretary, Department of Information Technology, Electronics & Communications (ITE&C, Govt of Telangana), said the government would continue collaborating with OpenAI to promote AI innovation and opportunities.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit"

            "article_content": "Health tech companies focused on behavioral health are confident that reimbursement trends favor them in 2025.\n\nPayment flexibilities for telehealth, hospital-at-home care and remote prescribing have been temporarily extended until March 31. The changes will prolong COVID-19-era payment for remote care across all specialties.\n\nRelated: CMS deals telehealth a win, but sector still needs Congress' help\n\nFor many in mental health tech, new reimbursement codes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 November physician payment rule are an even bigger deal.\n\nThe codes reimburse providers for using digital mental health treatment applications or devices that have been cleared or granted De Novo authorization by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nWhile the codes are narrow in scope, analysts said the move signifies a larger recognition among CMS and commercial insurers that virtual platforms treating mental health should be reimbursed.\n\n\u201cThere has been a shortage of good mental health providers, and it is easy to argue that mental health services can be delivered in a virtual environment. No examination is needed,\u201d said Carrie Nixon, co-founder and managing partner of Nixon Gwilt Law, which works with digital health companies. \u201cThose factors have made mental and behavioral health the obvious jumping off point for all types of virtual, synchronous and asynchronous methods of delivering care.\u201d\n\nDigital therapeutics companies, which develop programs that can treat patients primarily through smartphone applications, have struggled because of a lack of reimbursement, said Andy Molnar, CEO of industry trade group the Digital Therapeutics Association.\n\nThe codes will be a lifeline for many behavioral health-focused digital therapeutics companies such as Big Health. The company has two FDA-cleared apps for treating insomnia and anxiety and is in line to benefit from CMS\u2019 new codes, said CEO Yael Berman.\n\nThere has been demand for Big Health\u2019s apps from providers looking for first-line treatment for sleeping disorders but no reimbursement, she said. The lack of reimbursement has limited its growth opportunities.\n\n\u201cReimbursement has really been the key barrier because we've had providers reaching out over the years, but there was no way to get them to be able to offer it to their patients unless it was free,\u201d Berman said.\n\nJoe Perekupka, CEO of digital therapeutics company Freespira, said the shortage of mental health providers requires a more progressive approach from the federal government in treating the mental health crisis. Perekupka said with these codes, he hope CMS is starting to recognize this need.\n\nFreespira, which offers a mobile health to reduce symptoms of panic disorder, panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder, is unsure its services fit within the scope of CMS\u2019 codes, Perekupka said. Still, he predicted the codes will open the door to expand for broader digital mental health treatments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a monumental shift in the philosophy at CMS,\u201d Perekupka said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a big shot of adrenaline into the arm of digital mental health treatment.\n\nOutside the therapeutics space, companies such as Brightside Health and Talkspace have seen a shift in mentality from the federal government. In May, virtual mental health company Talkspace began rolling out its services to Medicare members. The company is expecting Medicare members to adopt the program this year when it starts marketing their services, said Erin Boyd, chief growth officer.\n\nIn addition to changes at the federal level, more commercial insurers are actively engaging with mental health tech companies, Boyd said. Talkspace has shifted its focus over the past few years from a direct-to-consumer payment model to working with commercial insurers and employers. The payer business accounted for more than 65% of its revenue through the first nine months of 2024.\n\n\u201cAfter COVID, it just made sense to be in as many networks as possible,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cWe changed our marketing focus two years ago to really emphasize that you could use your insurance to get Talkspace, and that's been significant in changing the amount of registered users we have on the platform.\u201d\n\nWith the opportunities increasing for reimbursement, companies must prove their worth to CMS and commercial insurers, said Molnar at the trade group. If the codes aren\u2019t used or the outcomes data isn't showing a strong return on investment, CMS will move slowly to expand coverage, he said."

            "article_content": "An app's performance is key to make users want to use it, say Meta engineers Dave LaMacchia and Jason Patterson. This includes making the app lightning-fast, battery-efficient, and reliable across a range of devices and connectivity conditions.\n\nTo improve Threads performance, Meta engineers measured how fast the app launches, how easy it is to post a photo or video, how often it crashes, and how many bug reports people filed. To this aim, they defined a number of metrics: frustrating image-render experience (FIRE), time-to-network content (TTNC), and creation-publish success rate (cPSR).\n\nFIRE is the percentage of people who experience a frustrating image-render experience, which may lead to them leaving the app while the image is rendering across the network. Roughly, FIRE is defined as the quotient of the number of users leaving the app before an image is fully rendered by the sum of all users attempting to display that image. Measuring this metric allows Threads developers to detect any regressions in how images are loading for users.\n\nTime-to-network content (TTNC) is roughly the time required for the app to launch and display the user's feed. Long loading time is another experience killer that may lead users to abandon the app. Reducing the app's binary size is paramount to keeping the binary small:\n\nEvery time someone tries to commit code to Threads, they\u2019re alerted if that code change would increase our app\u2019s binary size above a configured threshold.\n\nAdditionally, they removed unnecessary code and graphics assets from the app bundle, resulting in a binary one-quarter the size of Instagram.\n\nAs to navigation latency, this is possibly even more critical than launch time. Meta engineers carried through A/B tests to find out that:\n\nWith the smallest latency injection, the impact was small or negligible for some views, but the largest injections had negative effects across the board. People would read fewer posts, post less often themselves, and in general interact less with the app.\n\nTo ensure that no changes cause a regression in navigation latency, Meta engineers created SLATE, a logger system that tracks relevant events like triggers of a new navigation, the UI being built, activity spinners, and content from the network or an error being displayed.\n\nIt\u2019s implemented using a set of common components that are the foundation for a lot of our UI and a system that measures performance by setting \u201cmarkers\u201d in code for specific events. Typically these markers are created with a specific purpose in mind.\n\nCreation-publish success rate (cPSR) measures how likely it is for an user to successfully complete the process of posting some content. On iOS, posting a video or large photo is especially tricky, since the user could background the app after posting their content without waiting for the upload to complete, in which case the app may be terminated by the OS.\n\nHere, the approach taken by Meta was aimed at improving the user experience in those cases when posting failed. This was accomplished by introducing a new feature, called Drafts, to allow users to manage failed posts in more flexible ways instead of just providing the option to retry or abort the operation.\n\nWe discovered that 26 percent fewer people submitted bug reports about posting if they had Drafts. The feature was clearly making a difference.\n\nAnother approach was trying to reduce perceived latency, as opposed to absolute latency, showing a request has been received when the data upload completes but before it\u2019s been processed and published.\n\nLast but not least, Meta engineers saw a great improvement in app stability after they adopted Swift's complete concurrency, which, they say, does a great job at preventing data races and reducing hard-to-debug problems caused by data races."

            "article_content": "In a discovery that feels like science brought fiction to life, researchers at the University of Toronto claim to have shown that 'negative time' is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible phenomenon. In what could be a science from the movie Inception, where time is fluid and unpredictable, these researchers have shown in a new quantum experiment that light comes out of a material even before it enters. This goes against what we\u2019ve known about how time works.\n\n\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhile the results have grabbed global attention, many scientific communities are cautious about its credibility.\n\nScientists happy yet sceptical\n\nThough excitement has been sparked by the discovery, many scientists remain sceptical as the study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe scientific community is awaiting further validation.\n\nThe study looked at an area of quantum mechanics that has intrigued physicists for a long time: the nature of time and light\u2019s interaction with matter.\n\n\"It took a positive amount of time, but our experiment observing that photons can make atoms seem to spend a negative amount of time in the excited state is up!,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto and one of the key researchers on the project.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nAlso Read: Discovery of 40-million-year-old river system in Antarctica is a warning sign for humans\n\nDecoding \u201cnegative time\u201d\n\nSo what is negative time?\n\nThe idea of negative time makes us cast our mind back to H.G. Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents Change the form factor of the Fold Thinner, lighter, and curvier Improve the cameras Supercharge the battery and charging Unpack our tri-folding and rollable futures\n\n2024 was a challenging year for Samsung as its smartphone lineup has fallen stale just as it faces more competition in every smartphone segment than ever before. The Google Pixel 8a and OnePlus 12R challenge the Galaxy A, while the Galaxy S24 series faces challenges in every key market.\n\nThen there\u2019s the foldable lineup, and it\u2019s where Samsung has improvements to make. The company made foldable phones mainstream, but while it drove much of the initial innovation, the competition has begun to surpass it. The OnePlus Open proved that there was an alternative to Samsung\u2019s prowess in multitasking, and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 did little to dispel that notion last year. At the same time, Google made a much better foldable with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold; Honor proved that you can have a slim foldable with a big battery, and Motorola proved that it can outdo Samsung on the flip front.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nHow does Samsung bounce back? Here are five things the company can do to improve its folding phone lineup in 2025.\n\nChange the form factor of the Fold\n\nThe first Galaxy Fold kicked off an experiment: do customers want a taller and narrower folding phone or one more akin to a passport size and form factor? The answer is much closer to the latter, and six generations in, it\u2019s safe to say that Samsung needs to change the form factor of the Galaxy Z Fold 7.\n\nEach successive generation of the Fold brings us a thinner and lighter device, but the overall form factor hasn\u2019t changed. The key thing that makes the OnePlus Open, Honor Magic V3, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold better is that the front screen is more akin to the size of a regular smartphone. Meanwhile, the front screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is more akin to Sony smartphones, which have used a taller form factor for years.\n\nI have every Galaxy Fold, and the front screen experience has significantly improved, but after using the competition, it\u2019s much harder to transition back to the Galaxy Z Fold 6. I hope that Samsung finally moves on instead of going even taller and wider like the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition.\n\nThinner, lighter, and curvier\n\nThe Special Edition foldable released in 2024 does usher in a lighter and thinner era for Samsung. It\u2019s 1.5mm thinner than the regular Galaxy Z Fold 6 and weighs 3 grams less, and while this is a welcome improvement, the competition still beats it.\n\nThat said, the improvements in the Z Fold Special Edition are considerable. At 4.9mm thin when unfolded, it\u2019s 0.2mm thinner than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. It\u2019s still 0.5mm thicker than the Honor Magic V3 but on par with the rest of the competition.\n\nAs part of changing the form factor, I hope that Samsung integrates subtle curves and rounded edges into the overall design. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is extremely boxy \u2014 a design that isn\u2019t necessarily a negative \u2014 but the three key competitors feel far nicer in the hand. As we move into rollable and tri-folding phones, there\u2019s never been a better time to also focus on the in-hand experience.\n\nImprove the cameras\n\nConsider this: the Galaxy S24 Ultra has an outstanding camera with excellent zoom, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6 features the same camera as the more affordable Galaxy S24. This is more indicative of the industry as a whole, but the Honor Magic V3 proved it\u2019s possible to have three very capable cameras.\n\nSamsung hasn\u2019t changed the cameras on the Galaxy Z Fold lineup since the Galaxy Z Fold 4. While there are improvements through subtle sensor changes or algorithms provided by the Snapdragon chipset, it\u2019s fundamentally the same camera stack.\n\nThis is how Samsung\u2019s camera stack compares to the key competition:\n\nPhone Wide Ultrawide Telephoto 1 Telephoto 2 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 50MP, f1.8, OIS\n\n23mm, 1.0\u00b5m 12MP, f/2.2, 123\u00b0 3x optical zoom\n\n10MP, f/2.4, OIS \u2013 Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold 48MP, f1.7, OIS\n\n25mm, 0.8\u00b5m 10.5MP, f/2.2, 127\u00b0 5x optical zoom\n\n10.8MP, f/3.1, OIS \u2013 Honor Magic V3 50MP, f/1.6, OIS\n\n23mm, 1.0\u00b5m 40MP, f2/2., 112\u00b0 3.5x optical zoom\n\n50MP, f/3.0, OIS \u2013 OnePlus Open 48MP, f/1.7, OIS\n\n24mm, 1.12\u00b5m 48MP, f/2.2, 114\u00b0 3x optical zoom\n\n64MP, f/2.6, OIS \u2013 Xiaomi Mix Fold 4 50MP, f/1.7, OIS\n\n23mm, 1.0\u00b5m 12MP, f2/2., 120\u00b0 2x optical zoom\n\n50MP, f/2.0, OIS 5x optical zoom\n\n10MP, f/2.9, OIS Vivo X Fold 3 Pro 50MP, f/1.7, OIS\n\n23mm 50MP, f/2.0, 119\u00b0 3x optical zoom\n\n64MP, f/2.6, OIS \u2013\n\nMy frustrations with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 often come down to the cameras, and while they\u2019re perfectly fine, I think they should be much better. Samsung needs to deliver more on the camera front, especially as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold features similar camera hardware but outperforms the Galaxy Z Fold 6. It\u2019s been three years of the same camera stack, so it\u2019s time for Samsung to make a big improvement in 2025.\n\nSupercharge the battery and charging\n\nOf course, I\u2019m hoping Samsung fixes everything, which includes its approach to battery and charging. Since a fairly substantial setback with batteries on the Galaxy Note, the company has been risk-averse when it comes to pushing power into its smartphones.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Galaxy Z Fold 6 compares to the main competition in the U.S. and other key markets:\n\nPhone Capacity (mAh) Wired Charging Speed Wireless Charging Speed Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 4,400 25W 15W Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold 4,650 21W 7.5W Honor Magic V3 5,150 66W 50W OnePlus Open 4,805 67W None\n\nThen we look further afield and see how it compares to devices that have much more limited availability:\n\nPhone Capacity (mAh) Wired Charging Speed Wireless Charging Speed Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 4,400 25W 15W Vivo X Fold 3 Pro 5,700 100W 50W Xiaomi Mix Fold 4 5,100 67W 50W Tecno Phantom V Fold 2 5,750 70W 15W\n\nThe only phone that Samsung matches is the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, although I hope that Google will improve that in 2025, too. Outside the U.S., Samsung faces vast competition and has the smallest battery and slowest charging.\n\nCrucially, the value proposition has changed, especially considering the Tecno Phantom V Fold 2 has a bigger battery and charges faster despite being almost half the price. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still compelling, but with each competitor, it becomes harder to recommend.\n\nIn case you were wondering, it\u2019s not just the Galaxy Z Fold 6 but the entire Galaxy lineup, including the Galaxy Z Flip 6. Here\u2019s how Samsung\u2019s flip-foldable compares.\n\nPhone Capacity (mAh) Wired Charging Speed Wireless Charging Speed Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 4,000 25W 15W Motorola Razr+ 2024 4,000 45W 15W Oppo Find N3 Flip 4,300 44W None Xiaomi Mix Flip 4,780 67W None Honor Magic V Flip 4,800 66W None Tecno Phantom V Flip 2 4,720 70W None\n\nThe table above reveals a couple of interesting points. First, there are more flip phones without wireless charging than with, but the two available in the U.S. \u2014 the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Motorola Razr Plus 2024 \u2014 both support 15W wireless charging. Both feature the same battery capacity, but the Motorola Razr Plus wired charges much faster. It\u2019s a key part of the overall experience, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is considerably slower.\n\nOutside the U.S., both phones are dwarfed by the best from Oppo, Xiaomi, Honor, and Tecno. None of these phones support wireless charging, but Xiaomi, Honor, and Tecno all charge considerably faster than Samsung. Ultimately, it isn\u2019t just about the speed; Samsung needs to improve the delta between it and the competition.\n\nUnpack our tri-folding and rollable futures\n\nFor many years, the Galaxy Z Fold and Flip have offered compelling experiences, and while they continue to do so, they no longer provide the only experience you should buy. The competition is fierce in foldables as we know them now, so while Samsung needs to improve its current lineup, it also needs to focus on the next generation of folding phones.\n\nI\u2019ve seen concept phones with a tri-folding screen from many companies, including Samsung itself, and Huawei has already launched the first commercial tri-fold smartphone. Companies like Tecno are working to bring rolling devices to the market, while we\u2019ve also seen Lenovo and Motorola, respectively, show off concept laptops and phones with rollable displays. Samsung is likely working on its answer to expanding displays, but will it finally unveil these this year?\n\nRegardless, the Galaxy Z range still offers a great overall experience, and the S Pen is unmatched, but there\u2019s a lot of competition \u2014 and it\u2019s only getting tougher. Samsung needs to unpack the secret to innovation in its foldables again and quickly. It\u2019s already doing it on the software front with an excellent overhaul to its software in One UI 7; now, the hardware needs to follow."

No alternatives today,\" Na wetin Mr Podolyak tok.\n\nPieces of paper, like di 1994 Budapest Memorandum (about Ukraine post-Soviet borders) or 2014-15 Minsk agreements (wey bin try to end di Donbas War) dey worthless, im argue, without di added threat of military deterrence.\n\n\"Russia must understand say as soon as dem start aggression, dem go receive a significant number of strikes in response,\" im tok.\n\nBritain, Biden and di role of di West\n\nAs agreement on Ukraine long term future neva dey, dia allies dey do anytin wey dem fit do to boost dia defence.\n\nEarlier for December, Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, tok say dem bin look\"evritin\", including di supply of additional air defence systems, as part of how to protect di energy infrastructure fwey don already spoil for di kontri from any renewed wave of coordinated Russian missile and drone attacks.\n\nAs Ukraine dey continue to experience severe shortages of manpower, di UK Defence Secretary John Healey say di goment fit dey willing to send British troops to Ukraine to help wit training.\n\nFor dia part, e be like say di Biden administration wey dey comot from power dey determined to deliver as much congressionally approved military assistance as dem fit to Ukraine bifor dem go comot from office, although reports suggest say dem fit no get enough time to send evritin.\n\nOn 21 December tori bin tok say Trump fit continue to supply military aid to Ukraine, but im go demand make NATO members dramatically dia defence spending.\n\nKyiv allies bin don also continue to push up irreversible sanctions on Moscow, wit di hope say Russia war-time economy, wey bin don prove stubbornly resilient, fit finally break.\n\n\"Deep frustration say di sanctions no scata di Russian economy beyond repair dey,\" na wetin one US congressional source wey agree not to reveal im identity tok.\n\nAfta plenti rounds of sanctions (fifteen from di EU alone), goment officials don tire to predict dia successful impact.\n\nBut recent indicators dey increasingly alarming for di Kremlin. Wit interest rates wey dey 23%, inflation wey dey run above 9%, rouble wey dey fall and growth wey dey expected to slow dramatically for 2025, di strains on Russia economy neva even dey serious well-well.\n\nPutin dey put on a brave face. \"Di sanctions dey work,\" na wetin im tok for during im end of year news conference, \"but dem no dey of key importance.\"\n\nAlong wit Russia staggering losses for di battlefield \u2013 western officials estimate say Moscow dey lose an average of 1,500 men, wey dem don kill and wounded, evriday \u2013 di cost of dis war fit still drive Putin to negotiate.\n\nBut how much more territory wey Ukraine don lose - and how many more pipo wey go don die - by di time dem go reach dat point?"

The two drugs raked in $25 billion and $12 billion, respectively, for their manufacturers in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen patents expire, pharma company revenue can take a hit as rivals create similar offerings to take market share. Developing brand new drugs is a long, expensive, and risky process, so acquisitions of other companies with new medications in their pipelines offer a potentially faster way to generate new revenue.\n\nThis is partly why Chris Roop, head of M&A for the Americas at Jefferies, is expecting biopharma M&A to pick up in 2025.\n\n\"The gaps to fill are significant when you think about replacing drugs that achieve peak sales north of $20 billion or $30 billion drug before patent exclusivity expires,\" Roop told Business Insider in a recent interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLarge, successful pharmaceutical companies can become victims of their own successes when patents run out on blockbuster treatments, he added.\n\nAbbVie's popular arthritis drug Humira saw its patent exclusivity expire in 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, with patients increasingly turning to similar drugs or other prescriptions, AbbVie saw its revenue from global sales of Humira fall 37% from the previous year's quarter.\n\nTo make up for looming revenue gaps, Roop said Big Pharma will increasingly turn to M&A next year, buying smaller biotechs developing drugs in major markets such as obesity and oncology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2025's top drug targets\n\nObesity is positioned to be biopharma's hottest market in 2025, Roop predicted.\n\nRelated stories\n\n2024's biggest pharma acquisition was in obesity. Novo Nordisk's controlling shareholder Novo Holdings closed a deal in December to buy development and manufacturing company Catalent for $16.5 billion. The deal gives Novo Nordisk more manufacturing power for its obesity drugs Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nNovo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which makes Mounjaro and Zepbound, have a significant headstart in the exploding field of GLP-1 weight-loss treatments. Originally created to treat diabetes, injectable GLP-1 medications have surged in popularity. In May, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that one in eight US adults had tried a GLP-1 drug.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany other pharma companies want a piece of that pie, Roop said.\n\n\"Obesity is going to be a $100 billion to $150 billion market, so even if you come up with a third or fourth entrant in that market and only achieve 2% to 4% share, you still have a multibillion-dollar drug on your hands,\" he explained.\n\nBeyond obesity, Roop sees immunology and inflammation drugs as big targets for biopharma M&A next year. That market saw a few large deals in 2024, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals' $4.9 billion purchase of Alpine Immune Sciences, which has a drug in development that targets Berger's disease, an autoimmune kidney condition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Roop, head of M&A for the Americas at investment bank Jefferies, said Big Pharma will be looking for acquisitions in areas like obesity and immunology next year. Jefferies\n\nRoop expects oncology to remain a focus area for Big Pharma next year.\n\nHe said pharmaceutical companies are especially interested in precision oncology M&A, including drugs targeting more specific cancers and even new methods of personalizing cancer treatment.\n\nAstraZeneca made a precision oncology acquisition in March with its $2.4 billion purchase of Fusion Pharmaceuticals, which is developing a radiopharmaceutical drug, which uses radioactive isotopes to treat midstage prostate cancer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, Roop said Big Pharma will continue looking to buy companies with cardiovascular drugs in their pipelines. Heart disease and related conditions remain the leading cause of death. The global market for cardiovascular drugs was valued at about $150 billion in 2024, according to Precedence Research.\n\nNovo Nordisk bought Cardior Pharmaceuticals in March in a deal worth up to $1.1 billion to strengthen its cardiovascular drug pipeline.\n\nRoop said both private and public biopharma companies could be acquisition targets next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A lot of what we're doing is trying to find that equilibrium to fund these companies to a point in time where pharma will say \u2014 on that data with that amount of patients and with a drug profile like this \u2014 I'm willing to take the risk, buy it from that point, and take it forward into late-stage development,\" he said.\n\n\"There are a lot of private and public companies that are in that lane today. We probably have more privates today with advanced data than we did three or four years ago,\" he added.\n\nRoop said many of these private biopharma companies with advanced data are also well-positioned to potentially go public as the IPO window reopens."

            "article_content": "Budget 2024: Inherited pensions subject to inheritance tax in 2025\n\nA decision in the Budget to bring pension pots into inheritance tax threatens to leave middle income households in poverty in old age, it is claimed. A former pensions minister and finance industry expert, Ros Altmann, said the move will seriously remove a key incentive for paying money into a private pension. Under the existing rules, if a pension holder dies before the age of 75, their beneficiaries can typically inherit the remaining funds tax-free, whether as a lump sum or as income. After age 75, the inherited pension is taxed at the beneficiary\u2019s marginal income tax rate - 20 percent, 40 percent or 45 percent. The changes announced in the October Budget mean pension funds left to beneficiaries could now be treated as part of the deceased\u2019s estate for IHT purposes. This means they will be subject to the standard 40 percent tax rate above the \u00a3325,000 nil-rate band.\n\nREAD MORE DWP payments could be sent to thousands of UK homes\n\nCritics say the changes make it less attractive to saving into a pension\n\nAt the same time, the beneficiaries will also be taxed on the money they receive at their income tax rate of 20 percent, 40 percent or 45 percent. The net effect is that the vast majority of a pension pot - in some cases more than 60 percent - could be effectively confiscated by the taxman. Critics say the changes make it less attractive to saving into a pension, which is bad for individuals and the wider economy, because pension funds will have less to invest in UK businesses and infrastructure. Ros Altmann argues the changes are a disaster for people who have done the right thing and saved into a pension throughout their lives. She warned it is \"horribly reminiscent\" of a decision by former Labour chancellor and PM, Gordon Brown, to remove dividend tax credits from UK pension funds in 1997. Writing in the Mail, she warned Rachel Reeves that the new death duty is \"more like confiscation than taxation\" and could \"destroy\" the pensions system. Separately, the boss of City wealth manager Quilter has warned that the move risks \"undermining savers\u2019 confidence\". Ms Altmann warned: \"The bombshell Budget inheritance tax announcement is a potential disaster for pensions. \"It will mean less money going in, more early withdrawals, lower pension fund investment in long-term higher-return assets and more pensioners reliant on state benefits.\n\nTrending\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "THE year 2024 has been one of the most difficult in Tanzania\u2019s recent history, marked by a series of devastating events that have left communities grappling with loss and destruction. From catastrophic floods and landslides to man-made disasters such as building collapses and fires, the country has faced an extraordinary range of challenges.\n\nThese incidents have exposed the vulnerabilities of both Tanzania\u2019s infrastructure and its growing urban centers, underscoring the urgent need for improvements in disaster preparedness, infrastructure development, and urban planning. This article examines the key tragedies of 2024, their impacts on the nation, and the crucial lessons that must be learned to build a more resilient future.\n\nOne of the most catastrophic events of 2024 was the flooding caused by the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, which brought an unprecedented amount of rainfall to Tanzania, especially between March and May.\n\nThe heavy rains caused widespread flooding in both urban and rural areas, with regions such as Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Mwanza, and the Southern Highlands being hit the hardest. Entire communities were submerged, agricultural land was destroyed, and transportation routes were disrupted. Over 50 people lost their lives, and thousands were displaced, with the financial cost of the floods estimated at over 150bn/-.\n\nThe floods affected both rural areas and cities, with Dar es Salaam, the largest urban center, experiencing the most severe impact. The floods paralyzed daily life, disrupted transportation systems, and caused significant damage to infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and schools. Thousands of homes were flooded, leaving families without shelter, while vital farmlands were destroyed, pushing many households into financial distress.\n\nThe floods revealed just how vulnerable Tanzania\u2019s infrastructure is to extreme weather events and highlighted the need for better urban planning and flood-resistant infrastructure. With climate change intensifying these extreme weather patterns, the country must invest in sustainable water management and climate-resilient infrastructure to better prepare for future events.\n\nAlong with the flooding, 2024 also saw devastating landslides in the mountainous regions of Hanang and Mbeya, leading to tragic loss of life and displacement. In Hanang, the combination of heavy rainfall and steep terrain triggered massive landslides, claiming at least 15 lives and displacing hundreds of people.\n\nThese landslides also caused widespread destruction, blocking roads and isolating remote villages. Agricultural activities, which are the backbone of the local economy, were severely impacted as farmlands were destroyed.\n\nThe landslide in Mbeya in October was even more catastrophic, claiming 25 lives and leaving thousands homeless. The disaster affected both urban and rural areas, with heavy rains causing the ground to give way in vulnerable locations. Thousands of people were displaced, and access to basic services like healthcare and education was severely disrupted.\n\nThe financial cost of the landslides in Mbeya alone was estimated at around TZS 100 million. These tragic events have emphasized the urgent need for better land-use planning, early warning systems, and infrastructure development in high-risk areas. Rural communities, in\n\nIn November, a commercial building in Kariakoo, Dar es Salaam, collapsed, killing at least 20 people and injuring dozens more. The building, which housed various businesses, had long been considered structurally unsound. Investigations revealed that it had been built without adhering to safety standards, and its deteriorating condition had been ignored for years.\n\nThe collapse not only led to the loss of lives but also caused significant economic damage, especially for small-scale traders who relied on the market for their livelihoods. Kariakoo is one of the busiest commercial districts in the country, and the tragedy underscored the risks posed by rapid urbanization and inadequate enforcement of building regulations. Many traders lost their businesses, deepening the economic hardships already faced by the community.\n\nThe incident highlighted the need for a comprehensive overhaul of urban safety regulations in Tanzania, particularly in rapidly growing cities. Enhanced building regulations and better fire safety measures must be prioritized to prevent such tragedies from happening again.\n\nThe building collapse in Kariakoo wasn\u2019t the only disaster to strike Dar es Salaam in 2024. The city also faced a series of devastating fires in several markets, including Kariakoo, Buguruni, and Ilala. A major fire in August destroyed millions of shillings worth of goods, with faulty electrical wiring identified as the cause.\n\nSimilar fires occurred in other markets throughout the year, often due to overcrowding, poor infrastructure, and the lack of adequate fire safety measures. Many of these markets lack fire exits, proper electrical installations, and firefighting equipment, making them highly vulnerable to fire hazards. The repeated occurrence of these fires highlights the urgent need for reforms in urban fire safety regulations.\n\nIn April, a fire at the Mwanza Central Market destroyed goods worth millions. The cause, again, was faulty electrical wiring\u2014an issue that has plagued many markets across Tanzania. The total financial loss from these fires in 2024 was estimated in the tens of millions of Tanzanian shillings, further exacerbating the financial difficulties faced by traders and business owners. Tanzania must prioritize fire safety measures in urban markets and overhaul its infrastructure to prevent such disasters in the future.\n\nIn addition to natural disasters and man-made tragedies, road traffic accidents continued to be a major concern in Tanzania in 2024. With an increasing number of vehicles on poorly maintained roads, traffic accidents have become a significant public safety issue. Between January and October, more than 1,200 accidents were recorded, resulting in over 900 deaths and thousands of injuries.\n\nIn Dar es Salaam, traffic congestion and overcrowded roads are persistent problems. Many rural roads are also poorly constructed, lacking proper signage and maintenance. The high number of fatalities from traffic accidents demonstrates the urgent need for better road infrastructure, stricter enforcement of traffic laws, and comprehensive driver education programs. Without improvements in these areas, Tanzania will continue to face a high number of preventable traffic deaths.\n\nThe year 2024 also saw a resurgence of cholera outbreaks in several regions of Tanzania, particularly in areas like Dodoma, Singida, and Tabora, where floods exacerbated existing sanitation issues. The inadequate sanitation infrastructure created ideal conditions for the spread of waterborne diseases, and more than 250 people died from cholera in the first half of the year.\n\nThe outbreaks underscored the urgent need for better public health infrastructure, especially in rural areas. Floods and other natural disasters often damage water supply systems and sanitation facilities, which increases the risk of disease outbreaks. To prevent future public health emergencies, Tanzania must improve access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare services.\n\nThe tragic events of 2024 have exposed numerous vulnerabilities in Tanzania\u2019s disaster preparedness, infrastructure, and urban planning. While the country has faced immense challenges, these crises also provide an opportunity for meaningful change.\n\nMoving forward, Tanzania must invest in building resilience against natural disasters, improving infrastructure, and ensuring the safety of its rapidly growing urban population. Key measures include enhancing early warning systems, strengthening building regulations, improving fire safety in markets, and boosting public health infrastructure. These steps are essential to reducing the impact of future disasters.\n\nBy working together\u2014government, businesses, and citizens\u2014Tanzania can build a safer, more resilient future, one that is better equipped to withstand both climate change and the challenges of rapid urbanization."

            "article_content": "Ever since Microsoft first introduced its Arm-based Copilot Plus laptops in June, I\u2019ve been wondering when we might see Copilot Plus features appear on desktop PCs. Six months on, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re about to see mini PCs that deliver the AI performance required for features like Recall, Click To Do, and AI-powered image generation and editing in Windows 11. These mini PCs might even help Microsoft compete with Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nAsus became the first PC manufacturer to announce a mini PC that\u2019s Copilot Plus capable in September. It then revealed the full specs of its upcoming NUC 14 Pro AI last month, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that kicks off next week. Asus\u2019 mini PC even has a Copilot button on the front and is almost identical to the size of Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nThe timing of Asus\u2019 spec drop came on the same day that Taiwanese company Geekom revealed three new mini PCs that it will showcase at CES. Geekom is releasing a mini PC with AMD\u2019s Strix Point CPUs inside and one with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processor, meaning both will be Copilot Plus compatible. The third model is powered by Intel\u2019s unannounced Arrow Lake-H laptop processors, which are unlikely to have an NPU sufficient enough to be Copilot Plus compatible.\n\nI\u2019m going to be paying close attention to CES next week to see if there are any other Windows OEMs that are ready to launch Copilot Plus mini PCs. CES is usually a launch point for Microsoft\u2019s latest laptop or tablet initiatives, and last year the company convinced OEMs to put a Copilot key on their laptop keyboards. Asus wouldn\u2019t be adding a Copilot button on the front of its own mini PC without Microsoft\u2019s involvement, so I wonder how many other PC makers Microsoft has been working with to add dedicated Copilot buttons.\n\nGeekom\u2019s mention of Qualcomm chips inside its mini PC means we\u2019ll start to see Qualcomm\u2019s latest chips venture beyond laptops for the first time. Qualcomm was supposed to ship its mini PC Snapdragon Dev Kit in June alongside Copilot Plus laptops, but it ended up canceling it months later after issues with manufacturing the device. Qualcomm has also teased that its Snapdragon X Elite chips could appear in mini PCs or even all-in-one PCs, so perhaps we\u2019ll see some Copilot Plus all-in-one PCs next week, too.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see when we might get Copilot Plus features on traditional powerful desktop PCs. Intel\u2019s latest Core Ultra desktop CPU arrived in October with an NPU inside, but it wasn\u2019t capable enough to hit the 40 TOPS requirement that Microsoft mandates for Copilot Plus features. We\u2019re going to have to wait until next-gen desktop CPUs from Intel and AMD arrive to see if more capable NPUs are a priority for chipmakers. Until then, mini PCs and all-in-one PCs that use laptop processors are going to be the only way to get Copilot Plus features in a desktop PC form factor.\n\nWhile Copilot Plus features remain limited to Windows PCs, that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t see the main Copilot assistant appear on more devices. I\u2019ve heard from multiple sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans that the company is keen to get Copilot on devices beyond just PCs, phones, and tablets.\n\nWe might well see Copilot appear on some unexpected hardware at CES next week, just as Microsoft has also been hinting about its ambitions for dedicated AI hardware in recent months. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri admitted in an October Notepad interview that the power of modern AI models \u201cwill free up the ability to innovate in hardware and come out with purpose-built hardware.\u201d\n\nDavuluri stopped short of detailing what dedicated AI hardware would look like for Microsoft, but weeks later Yusuf Mehdi, executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft, dropped some additional hints in an underreported interview with YouTuber Austin Evans.\n\n\u201cThese devices that see the world, that you wear on your body, on your person, I think that those combined with AI will be very valuable,\u201d said Mehdi in late October. \u201cIt can do image recognition, it can talk to you about what\u2019s going on. I think that\u2019s a fascinating place that we\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview Mehdi also describes wearable health-related devices as exciting and \u201ca big opportunity\u201d for the future. Microsoft then confirmed last month that Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has hired multiple former colleagues to help run a new AI health unit. It\u2019s hard to imagine Microsoft venturing into fitness wearables again after the Microsoft Band was scrapped in 2016, but I could definitely see the company wanting to partner with device manufacturers and offer up AI-powered health services for these types of devices.\n\nEither way, 2025 won\u2019t see Microsoft slow down with its ambition to get Copilot on all the screens we look at every day.\n\nThe pad:\n\nThanks for subscribing and reading to the very end. I\u2019ll be reflecting on Microsoft\u2019s 50-year history in Notepad later this year, so if there\u2019s a particular period of time you\u2019re interested in hearing more about,please get in touch: notepad@theverge.com."

Her discovery this week puts an end to one of Great Britain\u2019s oldest missing person cases.\n\nFox, now 68, disappeared from Coventry in 1972. On Sunday, West Midlands police released a grainy photo of her from around the time she vanished to the public asking for help one more time. The police stated in their plea that Fox had been living with her parents when she disappeared and could have been in a relationship with a man at the time. They also suggested that she may have moved out of the area.\n\n\u201cWe searched through every piece of evidence we could find and managed to locate a photo of Sheila,\u201d said Detective Sergeant Jenna Shaw, a member of the West Midlands police cold case investigation team.\n\nJust a few hours later, the 52-year-old mystery had finally been solved.

The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there. What did they capture?\"\n\nCheck Out the Viral Video\n\nSince then, the video has gone viral, sparking a mix of reactions. Some viewers suggest that the figures could merely be people in a snowy landscape, while others propose more outlandish theories, including the idea that the sight could be steam rising from industrial gases or fog.\n\nA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?#theparanormalchic #alien #airline #paranormal #ufo #fyp pic.twitter.com/CARF6XFGxD \u2014 Myra Moore- The Paranormal Chic (@t_paranorm_chic) December 30, 2024\n\nThe clip\u2019s lack of clear location and timing has only added to the mystery, leaving many to wonder whether the sighting could have an otherworldly explanation. \"What did they capture?\" Moore asked, encouraging her followers to share their opinions and theories. The video has since gone viral on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where users are divided between humorous interpretations and more serious discussions about the potential implications of the footage.\n\nUsers Reaction to the Viral Post\n\nThe most conclusive explanation of the video was given by a twitter user with an image and he said that, \u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks.\u201d\n\nAnother one said, \u201cThat\u2019s wild. Are those angels? Something big is coming. 2025 is going to be a crazy year. Buckle up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are Cloud storage engineers checking servers and data in the cloud.

            "article_content": "Since November 13, New Jersey has been in the midst of a genuine drone panic. It began as a handful of sightings outside military bases like the U.S. Army\u2019s Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, a research and manufacturing site that was once the site of bomb-making during World War II. That has since exploded to over 5,000 sightings reported to the FBI across not only New Jersey but at least ten other states.\n\nReports of car-sized drones, blinking lights, and mysterious objects zipping through the skies have caused widespread hysteria to the point that, in December, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy urged the public to \u201ccalm down,\u201d assuring residents that \u201csophisticated federal investigators\u201d are now involved.\n\nThe FBI says the drones pose no risk to civilians, and of the thousands of sightings, sightings, the Bureau only felt 100 reports were worth following up on, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said during a December 16 press briefing. Still, as of January 2, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued 57 drone flight restrictions over New Jersey, largely over critical infrastructure.\n\nWhile the government lacks concrete explanations for the sightings, there are many theories about the current drone \u201cflap\u201d to borrow a term from the UFO world that describes a rash of flying saucer sightings. Scientists, skeptics, aircraft pilots, experienced drone operators, and conspiracy theorists have all proposed their own beliefs\u2014some mundane, some fantastical. Many of the hunches are almost certainly correct, such as airplanes being misidentified as drones or classified government activity taking place. But other ideas, including alien \u201cmotherships\u201d flying over the ocean or a drone version of the \u201cchemtrail\u201d conspiracy theory, seem less likely.\n\nConfronted with mysteries, people tend to see what they want to see, overlaying their own belief systems on the unknown in an attempt to make sense of it. In psychology, this is known as confirmation bias, and it\u2019s a very human response\u2014but that doesn\u2019t make our assumptions correct. So, we rounded up the nine most popular theories about the New Jersey drone frenzy, ranked from most to least likely.\n\nPeople are noticing drones that have always been around.\n\nDrones have been around for about a decade, and many drones are used for policing, surveying, and search and rescue. It is quite likely that many of the reported drone sightings are just that: drones that have been zipping around for years, doing completely ordinary drone things, and people are just now noticing them.\n\n\u201cThere are more than 1 million drones that are lawfully registered with the Federal Aviation Administration here in the United States,\u201d Kirby said during last month\u2019s White House press briefing on the rash of drone sightings. \u201cAnd there are thousands of commercial, hobbyist and law enforcement drones that are lawfully in the sky on any given day. That is the ecosystem that we are dealing with.\u201d\n\nNatural and human-made phenomena are being misidentified as drones.\n\nLike UFO sightings throughout their history, people with no observation training are reporting ordinary objects in the night sky as drones. Civil aviation pilots have reported an uptick in lasers pointed at their aircraft since the wave of sightings began, the result of people misidentifying harmless planes as drones. (It\u2019s worth pointing out that aiming a laser at an airplane is a federal crime .)\n\nA well-known phenomenon responsible for UFO sightings is that planes flying directly toward or away from an observer often appear to be \u201chovering\u201d in place. In a particularly embarrassing example, former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan posted to X a video of what he claimed were drones, but the constellation Orion. A similar sighting posted to social media was .\n\nThe wave is being exacerbated by real drone operators pranking the public.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to anonymously fly a hobbyist drone. One possibility is that some of the drone sightings are the result of drone operators that are deliberately stirring the pot with their own drones. This, however, would be risky, as operators must be FAA-certified, and violating regulations can land you a $75,000 fine and a revoked certification .\n\nThe drones are being flown by spies from hostile countries with nefarious intent.\n\nAnother theory is that agents from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran are flying the drones. Spies could be attempting to use drones to record classified Pentagon activity or rehearse attacks on American soil. One New Jersey congressman has claimed , without proof, that the drones are coming from an \u201cIranian drone mothership\u201d anchored in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOn one hand, there have indeed been sightings of drones around sensitive military sites, , an Air Force facility currently working on the B-21 Raider stealth bomber. Additionally, a Chinese national was arrested in December for flying a drone over Vandenberg Space Force Base. On the other hand, there is no firm proof linking any of these events to hostile foreign governments, and the Pentagon denies that an \u201cIranian mothership\u201d even exists.\n\nThe drones are being flown by terrorists.\n\nA similar theory is that the drones are being flown by terrorist groups, either foreign or domestic, gathering intelligence or rehearsing an attack. The United States has no shortage of foreign terrorist adversaries that operate drones, including Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, or Houthi rebels. But all of those groups are currently preoccupied in the Middle East\u2014especially those fighting Israel, a much closer enemy\u2014or are clawing for local control in Syria. Domestic, home-grown terrorism is another possibility, especially with the current wave of political violence that included at least two assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe drones are owned by the government and are searching for lost radioactive material.\n\nOne conspiracy theory claims that the drones, outfitted with neutron detectors and other specialized equipment capable of detecting nuclear material, are searching for lost radioactive medical equipment . There is an element of truth to the theory: the Department of Energy\u2019s Nuclear Emergency Search Team, or NEST for short, is trained to search for lost, potentially dangerous radioactive material; homemade or stolen nuclear weapons; and \u201cdirty\u201d bombs. NEST does indeed have specialized vehicles, including trucks and helicopters, to detect such materials. But, according to ABC News , the \u201clost\u201d medical equipment was never lost. Furthermore, the Department of Energy denies it uses drones to detect radioactivity.\n\nThe drones are spraying chemicals.\n\nOther conspiracy theorists, including Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, are advancing the theory that whoever is operating the drones is spraying chemicals over population centers for unknown purposes. No chemical spray has been associated with the drones so far, and Greene\u2014a well-known advocate of far-fetched ideas once who suggested that Jewish space lasers were intentionally starting forest fires \u2014has not provided any proof. Another ding against the conspiracy is that drones have a limited range and payload, making them poor spreaders of chemicals.\n\nThe drones are part of an effort to enslave mankind and create a one-world dictatorship.\n\nIn the 1990s, Canadian journalist Serge Monast advanced the bizarre theory that NASA and the United Nations were planning to stage worldwide events that would cause mankind to reject Christianity and democracy in favor of a dictatorship headed by the Antichrist. The conspiracy, known as Project Blue Beam , would use holograms and drones to impersonate UFOs and angels. Needless to say, no evidence for this theory exists, and the idea that the drones are \u201c biblically accurate angels \u201d is pretty far down the list of rational explanations.\n\nThe drones are actually alien spaceships.\n\nTying Project Blue Beam for unlikely theories is the idea that the drones are actually misidentified alien spaceships.

Others deemed the video a fake, and a cluster still holds steadfast that it was alien activity, the Daily Mail said.\n\nThe Falcon 9 rocket has a \u201creusable first stage booster\u201d that ultimately fell back to the planet just eight and a half minutes after it left the ground. It was caught in the Atlantic Ocean on a drone ship.\n\nStitch, on the other hand, will return to theaters worldwide May 23, 2025, in a live-action version of the 2002 animated film of the same name. The lovable blue alien has been infiltrating other Disney movie advertisements in recent months, including the newly released film, \u201cMufasa.\u201d"

Wells' novel The Time Machine, where the protagonist travels through time to the future.\n\n\u201cNegative time\u201d might sound like it belongs in science fiction, but Steinberg supports its use, saying that it can lead to deep discussions on the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the negative time refers to the observation that light, or photons, can make atoms seem to spend less time in an excited state than expected.\n\nThe scientists studied how light interacts with atoms, focusing on a phenomenon called 'atomic excitation'.\n\nThis happens when photons pass through a material and are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to jump to higher energy levels.\n\nWhen the electrons return to their original state, they release the absorbed energy in the form of reemitted photons.\n\nThis process creates a slight time delay in the light\u2019s observed passage through the medium.\n\nAlso Read: Scientists discover anti-ageing formula which can also stop cancer\n\nA new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nThe concept was first observed in 2017 when Steinberg's then-doctoral student, Josiah Sinclair, first began to explore the interaction between light and matter.\n\nInitially, their inquisitiveness was aimed at atomic excitation and how photons interact with atoms in a material.\n\nThis led to a great observation: under certain conditions, the light appeared to \"emerge\" from the material before it entered, suggesting the presence of negative time.\n\nBack in Time, a 2015 film, looks at how Back to the Future, a classic story about bending reality through time travel, continues to fascinate us, much like this interesting discovery.\n\nCould negative time become a new frontier in quantum physics?\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)"

            "article_content": "A combination of Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity and quantum physics may help explain the expansion of the universe from a singular entity, P. Ajith, astrophysicist with the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bengaluru, has said.\n\nHe was at the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium (RSCP) in Kozhikode on Thursday (January 2) to deliver a lecture demonstration on \u2018Universe: yesterday, today and tomorrow\u2019. It is the first in the \u2018Cosmic Snapshots\u2019 series of lectures being organised by the RSCP.\n\nMr. Ajith pointed out that the concept of a primordial atom, proposed in the early 20th century by Georges Lemaitre, who is considered the father of the Big Bang theory, was just a \u201cstory\u201d and not a scientific fact. According to Lemaitre, the universe began with an explosion from a single particle at a specific moment in time. \u201cThe primordial atom is just a way of explaining what might have happened. At some point, the universe shrank into one tiny entity. To understand what happened then, we need to combine Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity with quantum physics,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ajith traced the history of our understanding of the universe, starting with Nicolaus Copernicus, who first suggested a sun-centered universe, and Galileo Galilei, who proved it through observations. \u201cGalileo\u2019s discoveries changed how we saw the universe and sparked the age of enlightenment and the Renaissance, leading to modern science and technology,\u201d he said. German astronomer Kepler improved Copernicus\u2019 ideas, discovering that planets move in elliptical orbits. Isaac Newton later proposed that the same force making an apple fall also keeps planets revolving around the Sun.\n\nMr. Ajith highlighted that Newton\u2019s laws of motion are still used today, especially in rocket science. He explained how the sun-centered universe concept evolved, revealing the Sun as just a small part of the Milky Way. Later, astronomers debated whether Earth was part of a single galaxy or many. Edward Hubble then developed a telescope to measure the distance to distant galaxies. Mr. Ajith also mentioned Einstein\u2019s theory, which described gravity not as a force, but as the effect of space-time, a concept he introduced to explain how gravity impacts space and the flow of time."
