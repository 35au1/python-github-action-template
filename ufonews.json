The one exception is his new version of Too Hot To Handle, originally from the band\u2019s 1977 album Lights Out, which he played on but didn\u2019t have a hand in writing.\n\nIn an interview in the brand new issue of Classic Rock magazine, Schenker reveals that he record the song as a tribute to bassist Way and guitarist/keyboard player Raymond, who died in 2019 and 2020 respectively.\n\n\u201cThese are my songs, with the exception of Too Hot To Handle, which is in memory of Paul Raymond and Pete Way,\u201d the German-born guitarist explains, adding: \u201cI still play UFO songs live, I dedicate them to both of them. I have a picture collage here [in his home] with all the guys I have lost over the years. Paul and Pete are part of it. I see them every day.\u201d\n\nMy Years With UFO coincides with the 50th anniversary of Phenomenon, the first album the then-17-year-old Schenker recorded with UFO after joining them from the Scorpions. In the Classic Rock interview, the guitarist recalls how Way took him under his wing.\n\n\u201cPete was a great guy,\u201d says the guitarist. \u201cI never saw him angry. But he was also very shy \u2013 he covered it up with all sorts of stuff. He was an open, innocent person. When it came to his girlfriends, he was very much an underdog. I heard stories about him not even having the guts to tell his wife he was going on tour, cos she would have locked him up. I think he suffered a lot in his life, but everybody loved him.\u201d\n\nSchenker had a thornier relationship with UFO singer Phil Mogg. The guitarist insists that he quit the band after Mogg punched him in the stomach (something Mogg has always denied). In the interview, Schenker reveals that he doesn\u2019t know if his old bandmate is even aware of his new album. Even though both men live in the British seaside town of Brighton these days, their paths rarely cross.\n\n\u201cI see him once in a while at the zebra crossing,\u201d says Schenker of the singer. \u201cWhen Paul Raymond died, I saw Phil in a parking lot. I cornered him so he couldn\u2019t escape: \u2018Hey Phil, come over here!\u2019 I gave him a big hug.\u201d\n\nMy Years With UFO, which sees Schenker recruiting a host of guest vocalist, also features a high-profile appearance from Guns N\u2019 Roses singer Axl Rose on a new version of UFO\u2019s Love To Love. The collaboration came about after Schenker enlisted Axl\u2019s GN\u2019R bandmate Slash to appear on a different song, Mother Mary. Axl actually song three different UFO tracks \u2013 including Too Hot To Handle and Only You Can Rock Me \u2013 before greenlighting Love To Love.\n\n\u201cAxl is a perfectionist,\u201d says Schenker. \u201cHe puts everything under the microscope. He was not happy with his performance on Too Hot To Handle and Only You Can Rock Me, but he did such a great version of Love To Love.\n\n\u201cHe would go back into the studio and do something else: \u2018It\u2019s not right yet, it\u2019s not right yet!\u2019 We waited and waited, and eventually he got it. It\u2019s a really good song for Axl to sing.\u201d\n\nRead the full interview with Michael Schenker in the brand new issue of Classic Rock, featuring Thin Lizzy on the cover and on sale now.

It's hard to know where to start: should I start with the first? Should I choose at random? Since the default list order runs chronologically, should I play the last, because that one might represent the creative apex of fictional studio UFOSoft?\n\nIt doesn't really matter, in the end, because there's a lot. I've been absorbed by point 'n' click horror Night Manor for the past few days, but when I first booted the game I got sucked into Barbuta and Bushido Ball and neglected the other 48 games for days. I've gone through a Walforf's Journey phase too, and I've completed some levels in Camouflage and Block Koala. I've definitely not completed any of the games.\n\nNo one should feel bad or slow for not completing any UFO 50 games as yet because, during a recent chat with the Mossmouth team, I learned that no one on the team has completed all the games either. And they made it.\n\n\"No, not at all,\" Eirik Suhrke said when I asked if he (or anyone else) had finished all the games. \"It's too much. We all similarly played all of them a little bit, but yeah, I've been watching stuff on Twitch and just seeing new stuff constantly. No one has the full picture.\"\n\nUFO 50's Paul Hubans said he hasn't even played past the first level of Campanella 3, for example, despite having invested \"hundreds of hours\" testing the collection in addition to being a designer.\n\n\"You need to focus on one level (game) at a time,\" Suhrke went on. \"You've got to just black out 49 other games for a little while in order to make any progress. Whenever I thought about the whole thing I would get very dizzy and overwhelmed and I'd have to go for a walk and then just try to block out as much of it as I could. It's only now that I'm seeing the full power of the whole thing come together.\"\n\nTyriq Plummer says that the way early players are reacting to the game\u2013their surprise at its extent\u2013is close to how he himself felt when he saw how it finally came together. \"It's one of those things where even though it's such a large and broad encompassing kind of project, it still manages to feel more than the sum of its parts,\" he said. \"And that's something that was hard to get a sense of when I was working on it. But everyone else is saying now that there's way more to this than I even realized. It's super cool.\"\n\nDerek Yu agrees. \"I think that's always the best, when you're surprised by the game that you're working on, and I think that's partly why it's been so enjoyable to work on it for all these years. We're constantly sharing and surprising each other.\"\n\nAccording to our review UFO 50 is a \"a superb retro-style smorgasbord\". I spoke at length with most of the Mossmouth team earlier this week, and you can read all about that here."

        "article_content": "UFO enthusiasts are attempting to draw parallels between a old video that appears to show a flying aircraft zooming through the clouds and the recently declassified image of the UFO that was shot down near Alaska last year.\n\nThe photo shows a seemingly glowing horse shoe-shaped object with ill-defined edges over the Yukon territory in northwest Canada on February 11, 2023.\n\nAn internal email obtained by CTVNews had a Canadian brigadier-general describing it as such: 'Top quarter is metallic, remainder white. 20-foot wire hanging below with a package of some sort suspended from it.'\n\nIt was shot down by a US Air Force F-22 stealth fighter on a joint mission with the Canadian Armed Forces following the now infamous Chinese spy balloon drama that made international news that month.\n\nA former officer with the Royal Canadian Air Force told DailyMail.com that based on his conversations with three active-duty staff who were involved with the shootdown, the object was a balloon similar to the Chinese craft shot down days earlier.\n\nNonetheless, a user on Reddit said they were able to stabilize a different UFO video from over 12 years ago, claiming it is similar to the object that was shot down.\n\nThe declassified image of the UFO that was shot down in Yukon territory by US fighter jets on February 11, 2023. Canadian authorities suspect it was a balloon similar to the Chinese spy craft shot down in US airspace days earlier\n\nThis is photo of a supposed UFO that some on social media believe looks similar to the horseshoe-shaped craft shot down in Yukon territory. This photo comes from an alleged UFO sighting video that's 12 years old\n\n'I recently stabilized this footage, which has drawn interesting comparisons to the \u201chorseshoe\u201d object reportedly shot down over the Yukon in 2023,' the poster wrote. 'After stabilizing the video, the object\u2019s crescent or horseshoe shape becomes much clearer, along with its curious flight dynamics.'\n\nThey said the stabilization was done with Adobe After Effects and Premiere, software packages for editing motion graphics and video.\n\nThe video was originally posted by a YouTube channel called 'xxxdonutzxxx', which claimed the footage was shot over Busan, South Korea.\n\nThe reactions to the stabilized footage were all over the place, with some people showing their excitement and others showing skepticism.\n\n'A better way to avoid confusion would be to publish a color, high-res photo or video, as they did with that jet intercept and the Chinese spy balloon. Amazing how transparency actually works,' one user wrote.\n\nA picture taken on February 1, 2023, shows the suspected Chinese spy balloon flying over Billings, Montana\n\nThe suspected Chinese spy balloon drifts to the ocean after being shot down off the coast in Surfside Beach, South Carolina on February 4, 2023\n\nAnother took issue with the entire idea that aliens are flying around in spacecrafts that always seem to look different in every UFO video.\n\nThey wrote: 'Serious question; why does every UFO look different? Do aliens hate mass production? Have they never heard of cost reduction through standardization? What does that say about their economy? Are they idiots?'\n\nThose who are more inclined to believe aliens are out there offered a number of explanations for this. There could many many different alien races with different vehicles, some said. Others thought their space crafts could probably shape shift.\n\nElsewhere on social media, people are claiming all of the videos on the now abandoned 'xxxdonutzxxx' are fake and were made by two CG artists named Nico and Marco Kaschuba.\n\nA person posted an alleged UFO sighting in Monument Valley, Arizona, from the 'xxxdonutzxxx' channel to a UFO forum on April 5, 2012.\n\nAt the bottom of the post, there is a copyright that belongs to 'Kaschuba Ufology.'\n\nDailyMail.com approached Marco Kaschuba for comment, but he didn't immediately respond."

The capital base in India is very strong today\u2026 if few trillion dollars of value is created [globally] because of AI, given the talent base India has, it is possible to create 10% value from India,\u201d said Mukul Arora, Co-Managing Partner at early stage venture capital firm \ufeffElevation Capital\ufeff.\n\nSpeaking at TechSparks 2024, Arora, however, cautioned that India will have to work hard to secure its share of the market.\n\nAshutosh Sharma, head of investments for India and Southeast Asia at Prosus Ventures, noted that AI can help create customised solutions for India\u2019s population.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of AI in India is we have a problem of access to quality education, health, skilling, etc. We have tried hard to figure out ways to customise the access to quality education etc through internet 1.0 and 2.0 [but the impact] is very limited without AI,\u201d said Sharma.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem and we have technology and we need someone in the middle to build [solutions],\u201d he added.\n\nThe investors also warned against jumping into a sector just because it\u2019s currently \u2018hot\u2019 or \u2018in demand.\u2019\n\n\"Because of something that has happened over the last two years in the space, I will not back off.

If you are getting validation there, then the next question is how to scale it. Don\u2019t worry about what the VCs are thinking, if they think a sector is hot, it is already too late,\u201d cautioned Arora.\n\nWhile starting up in India has never been easier\u2014with access to capital, technological advancements, and entrepreneurs who have set a global benchmark\u2014the investors emphasised the need to focus on solving unique problems for Indian consumers with high-quality solutions."

        "article_content": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nMost parents don\u2019t get very far into their new job before they encounter a situation that has them flummoxed. It could be infant sleep issues, toddler tantrums or screen time negotiations, but, inevitably, every parent will have the thought, \u201cWhere do I go from here?\u201d\n\nSome situations demand immediate action. You pick the shrieking toddler up in the middle of the parking lot for his own safety. Other times, you have a few minutes to mull over your response, perhaps consulting with a co-parent. What, for example, are the appropriate consequences for a child refusing to do her chores? Then there are the big decisions, like when to get your child a cell phone, that you may spend months or years worrying over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet there\u2019s a widespread cultural belief that good parenting (and good mothering, in particular) is mostly a matter of instinct, that if we could just tune in to our internal wisdom, all our doubts would resolve themselves.\n\nThis makes it difficult for parents to admit when they are uncertain or may have made a mistake. It can also prevent parents from reaching out for help if they feel shame about needing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, the proliferation of parenting \u201cexperts\u201d with varying types of credentials offering books, courses and podcasts is proof that many parents are hungry for advice. When we just don\u2019t know how to proceed, we would very much like a calm, measured voice to tell us which way to turn.\n\nBecky Kennedy, aka Dr. Becky, a psychologist who has been called \u201cthe parenting whisperer\u201d for millennials and who currently has almost 3 million followers on Instagram, would likely top many parents\u2019 lists of experts they wish they could have on speed dial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKennedy, who is both warm and unflappable, advocates for what she calls \u201csturdy parenting,\u201d which conjures an image of a parent as ballast for a ship navigating choppy water.\n\nStudy parenting, she said, is \u201cthe ability to effectively embody your authority while staying connected and validating and empathizing with our kids\u2019 feelings.\u201d\n\nA sturdy parent is not an authoritarian parent who puts an end to questioning with a sharp \u201cBecause I said so!\u201d They are also not a permissive parent who empathizes with a child\u2019s feelings and subsequently complies with all of a child\u2019s demands. A study parent manages \u2014 without collapsing or losing their cool \u2014 to both acknowledge (although not necessarily validate) their child\u2019s feelings and hold to the boundary they have set.\n\nHolding boundaries when it comes to kids\u2019 behavior actually helps kids feel safe. They don\u2019t truly want parents to bend to every one of their demands, Kennedy said. \u201cThat feels very dangerous to them, because they essentially feel like they\u2019re on a plane without a pilot,\u201d she added. Kids want to know that a competent leader is in charge and that you will get them safely to where they need to go.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no official training course or credentialing body for parents. Sometimes you manage to land the plane safely through blind guessing. Other times, you crash. Either experience, understandably, sends many frightened parents looking for expert guidance. We want an experienced pilot to show us how this whole thing is done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe chatbot does not suggest that I crouch down next to my child, hanging my head in shame and muttering, 'Oh my God, this is so humiliating,' which might or might not be what an actual human mother would have done in this situation.\u201d\n\nKennedy has been reaching her followers through social media, her website, books and podcast, and she has just launched a new app using AI technology that can give parents answers to their queries in real time.\n\n\u201cI realized with AI, I can now basically show up for parents around the globe in a way that\u2019s going to feel exactly like they\u2019re texting with me or like I\u2019m sitting right next to them,\u201d Kennedy told HuffPost.\n\nKennedy is not the first parenting expert to roll out an AI tool. Economist and author Emily Oster has Dewey, a \u201cpersonal librarian\u201d who will sort through all the content on her website to find the answer to questions such as, \u201cCan I eat sushi while I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d A quick perusal of the app store surfaces other options such as AI Parenting Coach and Granny: AI Parenting Coach, which are free to download but feature in-app purchases.\n\nWhen you sign up for Kennedy\u2019s The Good Inside app, which costs $279 annually or $84 for a three-month membership, you\u2019re first led through a series of questions about what kind of help you\u2019re looking for and what challenges you\u2019re facing. You then enter your children\u2019s names (or pseudonyms) and birthdates, and the app generates a \u201cdeck\u201d that you can spend a few minutes swiping through every day in order to hone your parenting skills, sort of like a language-learning app that promises to teach you through modest amounts of daily practice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou also get access to the chatbot. To test it out, I mined the depths of my imagination for a few completely random sample behaviors from children who exist only in the hypothetical.\n\nMinus the trademark warmth in her voice, the chatbot does indeed sound believably like Dr. Becky. Much as she advises parents to do, the virtual Dr. Becky begins each of her responses by empathizing with my frustration.\n\nWhen I type in, \u201cMy toddler is sitting on the floor of the subway station. She has taken off her socks and shoes and thrown them and is saying, \u2018I not going!\u2019 How do I get her back in her stroller?\u201d the app responds with reassurance: \u201cGosh, that sounds so tough \u2014 and you\u2019re definitely not alone in facing these toddler meltdowns. Toddlers are known for their strong-willed nature, especially during transitions!\u201d\n\nThe chatbot then suggests that I acknowledge my child\u2019s feelings (\u201cI see you\u2019re really upset and don\u2019t want to go\u201d) and then try giving her a controlled choice (\u201cWould you like to put your shoes on yourself, or should I help you?\u201d) or try making a game of it (\u201cLet\u2019s pretend we\u2019re racing to get your shoes on and hop into the stroller like a kangaroo!\u201d) It concludes with a gentle reminder (\u201cRemember, it\u2019s all about staying calm and showing empathy while guiding her back to the task\u201d) and ends with a little confidence-boosting (\u201cYou\u2019re doing an amazing job navigating these tricky moments!\u201d) to hit all the notes of a classic Dr. Becky response.\n\nNotably, the chatbot does not suggest that I crouch down next to my child, hanging my head in shame and muttering, \u201cOh my God, this is so humiliating,\u201d which might or might not be what an actual human mother would have done in this situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI then tried entering the same query into ChatGPT. It delivers a brief nod of sympathy (\u201cGetting your toddler back in the stroller during a meltdown can be tricky\u201d) along with a numbered list of suggestions that aren\u2019t substantially different from the Dr. Becky chatbot: \u201c1. Stay Calm and Use Humor ... 2. Offer a Choice ... 3. Distraction.\u201d Chat GPT also suggests that I may need to use \u201cPositive Reinforcement\u201d with a line such as, \u201cOnce you\u2019re back in the stroller, we can go see/do [something fun],\u201d stopping short of using the words \u201cbribe\u201d or \u201ccookie.\u201d Its final bullet point is: \u201cPhysical Assistance: If all else fails, you may need to calmly and gently place them back in the stroller, while explaining what\u2019s happening.\u201d I am reminded to \u201cstay patient\u201d as I do this, which is not exactly what the woman crouched on the floor of the subway station wants to hear. ChatGPT is apparently unconcerned with the issue of the socks and shoes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to take any AI-generated advice with a grain of salt. The information could be too generic, culturally inappropriate, outdated or even harmful.\u201d - Brooklyn-based psychologist Nanika Coor\n\nI asked Brooklyn-based psychologist Nanika Coor if she had any experience with a client using AI for a parenting issue.\n\nShe recalled how one mother, in a state of desperation as the clock neared midnight, asked ChatGPT how to get her toddler to go to sleep. \u201cI actually thought that chatGPT gave a pretty reasonable response,\u201d Coor said. But she \u201cnoticed that the answer didn\u2019t address the nuances, like the nature of the parent-child dynamic or the parent\u2019s mental and emotional state \u2014 which I knew played a role.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne big advantage of a chatbot app is its 24/7 availability. It\u2019s there with you at any hour, in any location. Coor thinks it\u2019s probably as good as a regular search engine when it comes to run-of-the-mill issues. In Dr. Becky\u2019s app, it\u2019s also easy to find situation-specific scripts, even without using the chatbot feature.\n\nBut if your child has multiple diagnoses or you\u2019re dealing with something complex, an app may be less useful as a resource.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to take any AI-generated advice with a grain of salt. The information could be too generic, culturally inappropriate, outdated or even harmful,\u201d said Coor, adding that it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for a parent to have data privacy concerns when entering personal information into an app.\n\nSupport Free Journalism Consider supporting HuffPost starting at $2 to help us provide free, quality journalism that puts people first.

In these situations, a parent would need individual therapy to learn to recognize their unique triggers and respond in an intentional way rather than a reactive one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a few helpful suggestions and a pep talk, AI may be able to do the trick \u2014 particularly a chatbot specifically geared toward parents, like Dr. Becky\u2019s. For insight into your particular family dynamics, however, you\u2019ll have to look inside yourself."

Another legend states the creature is so horrible to behold that people jump from the trestle in fear to escape it.\n\nMore:Just Askin' | What is the Pope Lick Monster? What to know about the Louisville urban legend\n\nWhere did the Pope Lick Monster come from?\n\nVarious accounts about the beast's origin differ. Some claim that the monster was originally a circus worker who swore to take revenge after being mistreated, while others claim it's a twisted reincarnation of a farmer that sacrificed animals to gain supernatural powers.\n\nThe myth gained some notoriety when Louisville-based filmmaker Ron Schildknecht released a 16-minute film in December 1988 titled \"The Legend of the Pope Lick Monster.\" In the film, a group of teenagers go to the trestle as part of a rite of passage and one of the characters comes face-to-face with the title beast just before a train comes into view. The teen barely survives by managing to hold on to a railroad tie while the train rumbles above him.\n\nConcerns about the film influencing children to attempt to cross the 90-foot high trestle prompted Schildknecht to submit a letter to the editor to The Courier Journal in 1989, in which he stated teenagers crossing the trestle had been a common occurrence in Louisville for generations, but little had been done by parents and teachers to discourage them from avoiding the dangers.\n\n\"My interest in producing this film was to examine the reasons for such behavior and place them in the proper sociological context in hopes of dealing with the problem with a deeper understanding of the factors involved,\" he wrote. \"In depicting high school students engaged in rowdy behavior, I am saying that this is how it happens, these are the circumstances and this is what it can lead to.\"\n\nHas anyone been hurt trying to walk the train trestle?\n\nYes, in fact at least two people have been struck and killed by a train since 2016 \u2014 a 26-year-old Ohio woman and a 15-year-old from Louisville.\n\nHow can I watch the \"Out There: Crimes of the Paranormal\"\n\nHulu and Disney+ subscribers will be able to watch all eight episodes of the series starting Tuesday. The third episode is titled \"The Pope Lick Goatman.\" Other episodes feature investigations of a supposed UFO crash in Long Island and ghosts believed to haunt San Francisco's Chinatown.\n\n\"Out There\" was produced by the creative team behind the \"Sasquatch\" series, also available on Hulu.\n\nReach reporter Leo Bertucci at lbertucci@gannett.com or @leober2chee on X, formerly known as Twitter"

        "article_content": "Although penicillin was discovered on September 28, 1928 by Andrew Fleming, a British physician and professor of bacteriology at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in London, it took fourteen years for the first civilian patient to receive treatment. Such a long delay to deliver what Popular Science called one of 1943\u2019s top ten \u201ctriumphs in medicine\u201d of all time seems unconscionable. In the decades since, it has been estimated that penicillin has saved more than 500 million lives. But word of Fleming\u2019s discovery was slow to spread, the therapeutic implications weren\u2019t entirely clear, and penicillin turned out to be quite difficult to manufacture.\n\nFleming, who admittedly discovered penicillin by chance, is reported to have said, \u201cWhen I woke up just after dawn on September 28, 1928, I certainly didn\u2019t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world\u2019s first antibiotic, or bacteria killer. But I guess that was exactly what I did.\u201d\n\nHe had been conducting experiments with common staphylococcal bacteria, or staph, but left an uncovered petri dish by an open window during a vacation in Scotland. When he returned, the dish looked different. It had the usual clusters of bacterial colonies, except for one spot covered in mold. \u201cIn the broth,\u201d Fleming later wrote, \u201cthe mould grows on the surface as a white fluffy growth changing in a few days to a dark green felted mass.\u201d Around the \u201cfelted mass\u201d the broth was clear\u2014nearby bacterial colonies seemed to have been killed by mold secretions.\n\nFleming continued to experiment with what he called \u201cmold juice,\u201d eventually isolating the Penicillium fungus as the bacteria slayer. He published his findings in 1929 in the British Journal of Pathology with only passing reference to the ramifications penicillin might have to treat patients suffering from serious infections such as pneumonia, scarlet fever, gonorrhea, or meningitis. Fleming seemed more focused on its implications for helping scientists who study bacteria. \u201cIn addition to its possible use in the treatment of bacterial infections,\u201d he wrote, \u201cpenicillin is certainly useful to the bacteriologist for its power of inhibiting unwanted microbes in bacterial cultures so that penicillin insensitive bacteria can be readily isolated.\u201d\n\nA decade after Fleming published his work, Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and others at Oxford University sought ways to manufacture penicillin at scale, which meant cultivating massive quantities of Penicillium. But they struggled to grow enough mold. Their production was so scant, in fact, that they ran out of penicillin while treating their first patient, Albert Alexander, in 1941. Without the medication, Alexander, who had been improving, ultimately died. It wasn\u2019t until Florey recruited help from the US Department of Agriculture and US-based pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Lilly, and Merck that mass production began in earnest.\n\nWhen, in 1943, Popular Science named penicillin as one of the top ten medicines in history, the contributing writer and physician, Iago Galdston, cited its superior infection-fighting performance when compared with the leading antibacterial treatment, sulfa drugs: \u201cPenicillin operates, as the sulfonamides do not, in the presence of pus and tissue fluids.\u201d Until then, no drugs existed that could fight \u201clong-established infections,\u201d which, as Galdston wrote, made penicillin particularly valuable. But even in 1943, penicillin was hard to come by. Galdston lamented, \u201cUnfortunately we cannot as yet produce penicillin in large quantities, and what is being produced has been preempted by the Government for military use.\u201d At the time, a single dose of penicillin cost $20 ($364 in 2024). By the time World War II ended in 1945, a dose of penicillin cost $.55 ($10 today) and was readily available in the US.\n\nLooking back, Popular Science\u2019s 1943 Top Ten List seems particularly prescient. In addition to penicillin, the new and emerging treatments that Galdston cited included vitamins and the importance of nutrition, hormone therapy to treat cancer and other disorders, and psychosomatic treatment, or the growing awareness that psychiatric disorders could manifest in physical symptoms and vice versa. Despite such medical blockbusters, it may be Galdston\u2019s final item that has had the most profound effect on medicine: \u201cBiological Thinking.\u201d Galdston defined biological thinking as an acknowledgment that \u201cthe basis of well-being lies in achieving the best possible adjustment between the individual and his physical and emotional environment.\u201d Today, we take for granted that excess stress from factors such as jobs, relationships, and finances, can make us sick, but in 1943 the idea was novel.\n\nPenicillin remains one of the most widely prescribed antibiotics. And producing penicillin still requires growing mold, but pharmaceutical companies have perfected the manufacturing process, growing Penicillium in deep fermentation tanks not unlike those used in breweries. But these tanks produce something even more valuable than beer\u2014Fleming\u2019s \u201cmold juice.\u201d\n\nPopular Science, December 1943:\n\nTen New Triumphs in Medicine\n\nMAGIC DRUGS, INGENIOUS INSTRUMENTS, WIDER KNOWLEDGE MARK THE RAPID ADVANCEMENT OF THE LAST THREE DECADES\n\nBy IAGO GALDSTON, M. D. Author of \u201cProgress in Medicine\u201d and \u201cBehind the Sulfa Drugs\u201d\n\nWithin the short span of the past 30 discoveries have developed in the field of medicine than in any comparable period during the entire history of the science. In times past, important discoveries often were followed by long periods of little or no progressive medical thinking. Today, discoveries of the utmost importance are following quickly on each other\u2019s heels.\n\nAmong these inventions and discoveries is an instrument with a moving pen, which can \u201ctake dictation\u201d from a patient\u2019s brain. The record of electrical brain waves that this amazing secretary takes down is read by the surgeon for indications of brain disorders. Another is a drug so powerful that one part in 25 million parts of water will stop the growth of bacteria. Still another has revolutionized the science of diagnosis, and has completely recast the modern physician\u2019s approach to the problem of healing.\n\nIn this writer\u2019s judgment, 10 of the greatest medical discoveries and inventions of recent years are: The sulfonamides; penicillin; the vitamins; the sex hormones; the relation of the sex hormones to cancer; the electro-encephalograph; the electron microscope; psychosomatic medicine; brief therapy; and biological thinking.\n\nThe Sulfonamides\n\nThe sulfonamides are without doubt the best known of the recent medical discoveries. And justly so, for no single group of com- pounds has proved as effective as this one in preventing and treating such a large number of diseases. Pneumonia, gonorrhea, erysipelas, childbed fever, many forms of bloodstream infection, trachoma, septic sore throat, urinary infections, meningococcus meningitis, chancroid, gas gangrene, actinomycosis, anthrax, scarlet fever, impetigo -these are but some of the conditions effectively treated with one or another of the sulfonamide compounds.\n\nEqually remarkable and numerous are the applications of the sulfonamides in the prevention of infection. Since their first use in this respect, the lives of countless men wounded in battle have been saved. The sulfonamides have also extended the scope of surgery, heretofore limited by the threat of infection supervening upon operations in contaminated regions. They are reducing the incidence of serious complications which in times past frequently followed on simple infections. There is, however, one particular aspect of the discovery of the sulfonamides which overshadows even its great practical results. The sulfonamides have given new life to the science of chemotherapy-the treatment of internal disease with chemicals. Chemotherapy got off to a great start when Paul Ehrlich discovered Salvarsan in 910 although for the next 25 years little new appeared on the chemotherapeutic scene. Then in 1935 came Prontosil, and later the sulfonamides, and the whole picture changed. But what changed most was the concept of chemotherapy itself. Paul Ehrlich and practically all of his followers thought of chemotherapy in terms of \u201cmagic bullets,\u201d that is, in terms of protoplasmic poisons which would kill germs, but not the human body. Unfortunately few such selective poisons were found. Most of the protoplasmic poisons proved as likely to injure the victim as the at- tacking germs. Then when Prontosil and the sulfonamides were found to be so amazingly effective against bacteria, the old theories of chemotherapy had to be recast, for the sulfonamides do not belong to the class of protoplasmic poisons. In fact, the sulfonamides are not even bactericidal, that is, they do not directly kill germs. They are, however, bacteriostatic: they arrest the development of germs by interfering with their metabolism. By thus weakening the germs, they make it possible for them to be overcome by the body\u2019s own defenses.\n\nToday, research follows the path of germ metabolism, and seeks to discover how that metabolism may be adversely affected by means of chemical agents. It is this new rational basis for chemotherapy that warrants our hope of finding chemicals with which to cure tuberculosis, leprosy, malaria, and other germ and virus diseases not affected by the sulfonamides.\n\nPenicillin\n\nHot on the heels of the sulfonamides came the discovery of penicillin, a chemotherapeutic agent in many respects superior to the sul- fonamides. This powerful new drug is derived from a fungus called Penicillium notatum. In 1929, this fungus, or mold, was an unwelcome in- truder into some staphylococcus cultures with which the English bacteriologist Prof. A. Fleming had been experimenting for quite some time. Fleming acutely observed then that wherever the fungus grew, the germs did not, and he reasoned that the fungus and the germs did not get along well together. He studied the matter further and found his reasoning correct.\n\nHowever, since the fungus was not antagonistic to all germs, but only to certain ones, he employed it to eliminate from groups of mixed germs those to which penicillin was antagonistic. But that was as far as the matter went at the time.\n\nWith the discovery of the sulfonamides it was natural for the scientists to turn their attention once again to the penicillium mold. Another English scientist, Prof. H. W. Florey, in 1940 extracted from the penicillium mold a brown powder-like substance. He found it to be an extraordinarily powerful drug, effective against a larger variety of infections than are the sulfonamides.\n\nThough but recently discovered, penicillin has already been subjected to numerous trials. Unlike the sulfonamides, which operate by diminishing the growth of bacteria, it has been found to kill bacteria or stop their growth entirely. But it will work in many cases where the sulfa drugs have proved useless or only partially effective. Penicillin operates, as the sulfonamides do not, in the presence of pus and tissue fluids. This renders it particularly valuable in the treatment of such conditions as osteomyelitis, empyema, infected compound fractures, and wounds and burns with long-established infections. Penicillin is superior in undermining the yellow pus-producing bacteria, the staphylococcus aureus, and many infections caused by cocci. And the user of penicillin suffers no toxic effects such as are sometimes experienced when sulfa drugs have been employed.\n\nUnfortunately we cannot as yet produce penicillin in large quantities, and what is being produced has been preempted by the Government for military use. There is, however, no reason to doubt that the chemists will before long succeed in crystallizing it and reproducing it artificially.\n\nThe Vitamins\n\nThe vitamins represent a major medical discovery of an order different from any of those thus far described. Biology and medicine have been radically affected by their discovery. Until vitamins were discovered, the conviction prevailed among medical men that there wasn\u2019t much one could do about health except to prevent disease. Doctors preached personal hygiene in terms of rest, cleanliness, exercise, fresh air, and good food. But they did so in the belief that they could only preserve health, which for any given individual was more or less fixed. For the rest, attention was focused on \u201cfighting infection\u201d by such means as vaccines, serums, antiseptics, and so forth.\n\nWith the development of the modern science of nutrition, of which the vitamins are an important segment, we learned that one could be not sick, but at the same time not healthy, as in the case of \u201csubclinical conditions,\u201d in which the patient is not manifestly ill, but also is far from well. We also discovered that susceptibility to many types of disease, including infections, was due to malnutrition, and that growth, de- velopment, and aging were profoundly influenced by the quantity and quality of the foods eaten.\n\nAs our knowledge of nutrition increases, and as that knowledge is applied to the everyday diet of people, we are bound to see a reduction in the incidence of disease, and an improvement in physical growth and wellbeing.\n\nThe Sex Hormones\n\nThe discovery of the sex hormones is one of the achievements of modern medicine on which the public is comparatively unin- formed. Yet it is truly a tremendous accomplishment.\n\nIt was a bright hunch that led to the discovery of the female sex hormone. When an ovum (egg) ripens in the ovary, it is surrounded by a minute quantity of a yellowish fluid, known as the liquor folliculi. No one thought to investigate the function of that fluid until 1922, when Edgar Allen, Ph.D., of St. Louis, and his wife obtained buckets of ovaries from a meat-packing plant and, working on their kitchen table, carefully drew off the fluid from the follicles. Soon they had enough of it to enable their coworker, Dr. E. A. Doisy, to purify it and determine its chemical constitution. This made possible the crystallization of the female hormone in 1929. In 1936 it was reproduced artificially. The discovery of the male hormone, which is credited to L. C. McGee, of Chicago, took place in 1927.\n\nThe sex hormones have proved enormously useful in the treatment of a variety of disturbances, including those of the sexual and reproductive functions. From this discovery was derived the original Aschheim-Zondek test for pregnancy.\n\nThe most important result of the discovery of sex hormones, however, is the light it has thrown upon the complicated structures and operations of the glands of internal secretion. These glands affect growth, development, metabolism, sexual function, reproduction; in fact, all phases of the \u201cinner activities\u201d of the human body.\n\nThe Relation of the Sex Hormones to Cancer\n\nCancer of the prostate is one of the most common types of malignancy affecting men. This type of cancer is difficult to discover in its early stages, and tends to spread so work of uniformly close tolerances is performed rapidly that, in actual experience, less than five percent of such cases can be successfully treated surgically.\n\nIn 1941, Dr. C. Huggins, of the University of Chicago, advanced the idea that the prostate cancer cells require the male hormone for their continued existence, even as the normal prostate cells do. He and his associates reasoned from this that castration or else the \u201cneutralization\u201d of the male hormone by means of the female hormone should adversely affect the prostate cancer growths. He, and others after him, tried the latter treatment. The results were astonishing. Although the cancer is not cured, most of the patients benefit enormously. Pain disappears, nutrition improves, appetite returns, and strength is regained. The original cancer growth in the prostate, and those that have spread to other parts of the body, regress so that many sufferers are enabled to carry on their normal activities in comfort. This treatment of prostatic cancer is vastly superior to any previously available. But the greatest value of the discovery is that it has stimulated many scientists to study the relation of the sex hormones to cancer in general.\n\nThe Electro-Encephalograph\n\nThis recent invention is a sleuthing machine for tracking down the mysterious ways of the brain. Working by means of vacuum tubes similar to those used in a radio, it picks up \u201cbrain waves\u201d-electrical impulses generated in the head by brain function. These currents, which have distinguishing characteristics, are visibly recorded by a moving pen. Since a brain suffering from some organic ailment sends out waves differing from those generated by a normal one, the record set down by the electro-encephalograph can be read by the brain surgeon for indications of such dis- orders as brain tumors and epilepsy. This useful diagnostic instrument promises to be of great value in the study of the physiology of the nervous system, and of the dynamics of drugs employed for their effects on the nervous system.\n\nThe Electron Microscope\n\nThe electron microscope likewise promises to prove a great research instrument. The ordinary microscope cannot magnify an object beyond approximately 2,000 diameters, this limitation being imposed by the wavelength of light. The electron microscope, however, can magnify objects from 50,000 to a 100,000 diameters. It can, therefore, be readily seen how this extremely powerful instrument has opened up new and vast fields of research in bacteriology and biochemistry. We are now able to obtain a really intimate insight into the structure of both living and nonliving matter, and, most interestingly, of that \u201cin-between\u201d matter known as the viruses, which are responsible for such destructive diseases as smallpox, influenza, and infantile paralysis.\n\nPsychosomatic Medicine\n\nOne of the more interesting developments of psychiatry goes by the name of psychosomatic medicine. It represents the fusion of orthodox clinical medicine with the best in psychiatric knowledge. It teaches the important lesson, in an irrefutable way, that there is no disorder of the soma (the body) without some involvement of the psyche (the mind and the emotions), and conversely, that psychiatric disorders have their somatic (physical) components. In some instances, indeed, physical symptoms are the only tangible manifestations of what is primarily a psychiatric condition. This insight into the interplay of psyche and soma has made possible a much more effective treatment of many conditions which in times past could be treated only superficially. It also enables the physician to anticipate, and by appropriate action to prevent, the development of a variety of physical and emotional strains and disorders.\n\nBrief Therapy\n\nRelated to psychiatry is the new experimental development of brief therapy. The objective of these experiments is, simply, brevity of treatment. Most of the techniques of psychiatric therapy as practiced today are lengthy and therefore costly. Far too many persons who require treatment cannot afford it. And there are not enough trained psychiatrists available to meet the needs. To correct these deficiencies, studies, conferences, and experiments are being conducted to develop techniques of psychotherapy that will be effective but less time-consuming.\n\nBiological Thinking\n\nFinally we come to that development in present-day medicine which blankets all others: the ability to think biologically. Today the physician thinks of his patient in terms of his many environmental relationships\u2013his job, his marriage, his friends, his education, his degree of success, and so forth. A short while ago, however, the physician thought of his patient only in terms of his complaints, of the symptoms or disorders he discovered and of the specific remedies he could use in the treatment of \u201cthe case.\u201d In fact, the physician was more concerned with the \u201ccase\u201d-with the disease afflicting the patient-than with the patient himself.\n\nToday, we know that to effect a permanent cure, the contributory as well as the primary factors must be considered and dealt with; that, in substance, the basis of well-being lies in achieving the best possible adjustment between the individual and his physical and emotional environment."

        "article_content": "A discovery has been made which has the ability to change everything that we know about the universe.\n\nThat's right, and it's all because of The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).\n\nIf you don't know what it is, the JWST is a more advanced version of the legendary 1990 Hubble telescope, which was launched into space in December 2021.\n\nAdvert\n\nLiving up to its expectations, the JWST has made numerous discovers in space, which could even point to there being life beyond our small planet.\n\nIt also went on to find that potential planets could be forming right before our eyes after discs and dust gathered around two stars.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has made a shocking discovery (Getty Stock Image)\n\nThe telescope has captured so many high resolution images of galaxies, as well as stars being formed and even early stage black holes (which is more scary than it is cool).\n\nAdvert\n\nBut it's JWST also made a shocking discovery, which one physicist has called a 'crisis' in the way we understand the universe.\n\nAstronomers have used the information from both the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes to confirm one of the problems in physics that still baffles them.\n\nWhat is the Hubble Tension?\n\nThe issue they need help with is that scientists have arrived at different estimates of the rate of the universe's expansion.\n\nAdvert\n\nThis is called the Hubble Tension, and could potentially upend the world of cosmology for good.\n\nHave we misunderstood the universe? (Getty Stock Image)\n\nHow do we know how fast the universe is expanding?\n\nThere are two ways to figure out the Hubble constant - a value that describes the universe's expansion rate.\n\nAdvert\n\nThe first way is basically through the Big Bang's leftovers, which are tiny fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, astronomers figured out that this figure was roughly 46,200 mph per million light years, or about 67 kilometres per second per megaparsec (km/s/sMpc).\n\nThe second way is to use pulsating stars, also known as Cepheid variables.\n\nAstronomers use the outer layers of dying stars, which flicker like broken street lights in the distance.\n\nAdvert\n\nBy measuring its brightness, these Cepheid stars can be chained into a 'cosmic distance ladder', which allows us to look further into the past of the universe.\n\nUsing this, an exact number can be pinpointed that reveals the speed of the universe's expansion.\n\nEstimates of the universe's rate of expansion contradict each other\n\nBy using the second method, Adam Riess - professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University - and his colleagues estimated that the universe's expansion rate is actually about 74 km/s/Mpc, a value much higher than the previously thought 67 km/s/Mpc.\n\nThis could make the universe 10 percent younger than we originally thought.\n\nScientists have called it a 'crisis' (Getty Stock Image)\n\nThe world of cosmology has been catapulted into uncertainty following this discovery.\n\nNobel Prize winning astronomer David Gross called it a 'crisis' at a 2019 conference.\n\nWhat did the James Webb Space Telescope find?\n\nInitially, the discovery was thought to be a measurement error by confusing Cepheid stars with regular stars in the Hubble's lens, but the much more accurate JWST disproved these claims, confirming the new discovery.\n\nOn 6 February, a study was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, highlighting that our understanding of the universe could be very, very wrong.\n\nLead study author Riess stated: \"With measurement errors negated, what remains is the real and exciting possibility we have misunderstood the universe.\"\n\nRiess observed 1,000 other Cepheid stars in five separate galaxies as far away as 130 million lightyears from Earth, further confirming their findings on the Hubble constant.\n\nHe explained: \"We've now spanned the whole range of what Hubble observed, and we can rule out a measurement error as the cause of the Hubble Tension with very high confidence.\n\n\"Combining Webb and Hubble gives us the best of both worlds. We find that the Hubble measurements remain reliable as we climb farther along the cosmic distance ladder.\""

        "article_content": "Crinkles and divots in the surface of Earth on T\u00fcrkiye's Central Anatolian Plateau are the smoking gun for a newly discovered class of plate tectonics.\n\nBeneath a depression called the Konya Basin, Earth's crust is slowly dripping deeper into the planetary interior, a process that is gradually shaping the surface geology of not just the basin, but the plateau that surrounds it.\n\nIt's called lithospheric dripping, a phenomenon that has only recently been discovered here on Earth, and geologists are still figuring out the different ways it manifests.\n\n\"Looking at the satellite data, we observed a circular feature at the Konya Basin where the crust is subsiding or the basin is deepening,\" says geophysicist Julia Andersen of the University of Toronto.\n\n\"This prompted us to look at other geophysical data beneath the surface where we saw a seismic anomaly in the upper mantle and a thickened crust, telling us there is high-density material there and indicating a likely mantle lithospheric drip.\"\n\nWe have a pretty good idea of how it works. When the lower portion of Earth's rocky crust is heated to a certain temperature, it starts to go a little gooey. Then, like honey or syrup, it slowly oozes downward \u2013 a bit like a pitch drop experiment, but much bigger and slower.\n\nAs this drop descends, it pulls the planetary crust down with it. This creates a depression, or basin. Then, when the drop detaches into the mantle, the surface rebounds, bulging upwards, with a widespread effect.\n\nWe only began to understand this process a short time ago, but modeling its evolution has already allowed Andersen and her colleagues to identify one region of the mantle where dripping has taken place, at the Arizaro Basin under the Central Andes.\n\nNow, careful analysis of surface geology and laboratory experiments has led them to another oozy drip under the Central Anatolian Plateau \u2013 and the signpost was the Konya Basin.\n\nThe Central Anatolian Plateau is known to be uplifting over time. Previous research suggests that it has gained around a kilometer (0.6 miles) in altitude over the past 10 million years thanks to the release of a crusty drip.\n\nBut then there's the Konya Basin, which is subsiding downwards at a rate of around 20 millimeters (0.8 inches) per year. That doesn't sound like much, but a sinking patch of ground in a region that is rising upwards warrants further investigation.\n\nThe team's findings suggest that the broader region of the plateau is in the throes of the rebound phase of the lithospheric drip process, after having dropped its gooey molten load into the mantle. The Konya Basin? That's a smaller, second drip forming.\n\n\"As the lithosphere thickened and dripped below the region, it formed a basin at the surface that later sprang up when the weight below broke off and sank into the deeper depths of the mantle,\" says Earth scientist Russell Pysklywec of the University of Toronto.\n\n\"We now see the process is not a one-time tectonic event and that the initial drip seems to have spawned subsequent daughter events elsewhere in the region, resulting in the curious rapid subsidence of the Konya Basin within the continuously rising plateau of T\u00fcrkiye.\"\n\nThe researchers validated this model by setting up a lab experiment. They filled a plexiglass tank with a highly viscous silicone polymer called polydimethylsiloxane as a proxy for Earth's gooey lower mantle. A mixture of polydimethylsiloxane and modeling clay was used to replicate the upper mantle, while a mixture of ceramic spheres and silica sand served as the crust.\n\nThen, they inserted a dense \"seed\" into the upper mantle layer to initiate a drip, and observed the results. Within 10 hours, the first drip had started to fall. By the time it reached the bottom of the box, after about 50 hours, a secondary drip had started to descend.\n\nNeither drip was associated with horizontal deformation of the surface \u2013 only vertical. And these deformations were consistent with the Konya Basin.\n\n\"What we noticed was that over time, this secondary drip did pull the crust downward and started to create a basin, despite no horizontal movements in the crust at the surface,\" Andersen says. \"The findings show these major tectonic events are linked, with one lithospheric drip potentially triggering a host of further activity deep in the planetary interior.\"\n\nThese results suggest that lithospheric dripping is a multi-stage process, and neatly explains the strange, simultaneous uplifting and subsidence observed on the Central Anatolian Plateau.\n\nThe research has been published in Nature Communications."

Developers often spend valuable time writing boilerplate code, generating documentation, and debugging simple issues.\n\nGenerative AI can take over these tasks, enabling developers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of development. By offloading mundane coding tasks to AI, teams can experience increased productivity, faster project completions, and more time for innovation.\n\nThis efficiency gain is crucial in a fast-paced industry where speed is often tied to success. For developers, this means the potential for working on more challenging and rewarding aspects of projects."

        "article_content": "Microsoft Edge is a controversial browser that is the default internet access tool on the Windows operating system. While many users might be fine using Edge as a primary web browser on Windows, countless others take issue with many aspects of the browser, including bloatware features and privacy concerns, among others.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDifficulty Easy Duration 5 minutes What You Need Another web browser\n\nWith Microsoft investing in AI features such as Copilot, Microsoft Edge has become even more of an integral part of Windows. Microsoft is making the program harder for users to remove from its native operating system. Edge is also available for other device ecosystems, such as Apple and Chromebook, for those interested in a different experience.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown on how to install and delete the Microsoft Edge browser on different desktops.\n\nHow to install Microsoft Edge for Windows\n\nStep 1: Open another browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or Safari. Head to the official Microsoft Edge download page.\n\nStep 2: Accept the Microsoft software license agreement, choose the language from the drop-down menu, select Accept, and download.\n\nStep 3: The Microsoft Edge .exe download file will complete. Open the file to continue with the installation wizard.\n\nStep 4: Once the download is complete, the Microsoft Edge browser will automatically pop up, ready for use.\n\nAlternatively, you can access the Microsoft Edge browser from the Microsoft Store.\n\nStep 5: Open the Microsoft Store from the Windows logo.\n\nStep 6: Search for Microsoft Edge in the search bar.\n\nStep 7: Select Microsoft Edge among the search results.\n\nStep 8: Select the Install button and the app will begin to install.\n\nHow to install Microsoft Edge for Mac\n\nStep 1: Open a browser and head to the official download page for Microsoft Edge on macOS.\n\nStep 2: Accept the Microsoft software license agreement, select Accept and download.\n\nStep 3: The Microsoft Edge .dmg file will complete. Open the file to continue with the installation wizard.\n\nStep 4: Enter your password when prompted and wait for the installation to complete.\n\nStep 5: When you see the prompt asking if you want to delete the installer files, you can select Empty bin.\n\nStep 6: To find the newly installed Microsoft Edge browser, select Launchpad on the dock and look for the Edge icon.\n\nStep 7: Select Microsoft Edge to open the browser and it is ready for use.\n\nStep 8: To uninstall Microsoft Edge on macOS, find and remove it in your Applications folder.\n\nHow to install Microsoft Edge for Chromebook\n\nStep 1: Open the Google Play Store.\n\nStep 2: Search \u201cMicrosoft Edge.\"\n\nStep 3: Select Install. The app will install.\n\nStep 4: Select Open. The app will ask if you want to make it your default browser.\n\nStep 5: Make your choice. Then log into your Microsoft account if you choose and begin browsing.\n\nStep 6: During the first browsing experience, you will see an option allowing you to choose between phone, tablet, and sizable screen configurations. Change the screen to sizable if you\u2019re on a desktop. This will allow you to maximize your screen.\n\nStep 7: Similar to macOS, you can uninstall Microsoft Edge, just like any other app in ChromeOS.\n\nHow to uninstall Microsoft Edge on Windows\n\nUninstalling Microsoft Edge from Windows is a challenge because the app is a default app on Windows OS and is also the system\u2019s default browser. In prior years, Microsoft allowed for a simple uninstall process through its settings; however, the uninstall option is now grayed out if you attempt to remove the app from your system. This restriction also varies depending on where in the world you live. If you live in the EU, you can uninstall Microsoft Edge in the traditional way via settings, but if you\u2019re in the U.S. or U.K., this function is not available. You should check to ensure that the ability to uninstall the browser is available in your region.\n\nThere are roundabout methods for uninstalling Microsoft Edge, such as using uninstaller apps or Command Prompts. However, these options can break various functions on your computer system, including the new Copilot AI tool and features in the Microsoft App Store that are also default aspects of Windows. Attempting to uninstall the app could also leave your desktop in a loading loop and in need of additional troubleshooting. Over time, Microsoft has sent out updates that override the effectiveness of these methods as well. It is also possible for Microsoft to reinstall Edge in a future update, leaving you stuck with the browser once again.\n\nMicrosoft recommends not attempting to uninstall the Edge browser, but here are some of the safest methods available for removing the app from your desktop.\n\nIgnore Microsoft Edge\n\nThe safest option is to ignore Microsoft Edge and use a different browser option, such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, or any other of your preference. You can remove the browser visually from your desktop, start menu, and taskbar by right-clicking the icon and selecting delete or un-pin. However, Microsoft Edge will still live on your desktop in the background.\n\nTo ensure your system favors the browser of your choice over Microsoft Edge, you can set it as your default browser. Go to Settings > Default Apps > Search or Scroll Through Set Defaults for Applications to find your choice browser. Select the browser, then select Default. It will become the main browser that your desktop responds to, overriding Microsoft Edge.\n\nRegistry editor uninstall on Windows\n\nThe Registry Editor option essentially enables the uninstall ability in Microsoft Settings so you can proceed to uninstall Microsoft Edge as you would normally. This method will highlight the uninstall option in Settings once more, in theory allowing you to uninstall Microsoft Edge. However, some who have attempted to use this method claim it does not remove the browser; it just opens the uninstall option. It also seems to work for some users and not for others. So proceed with caution when using this method.\n\nStep 1: To open the Windows Registry Editor, go to the Start search box, type \"regedit,\" and select Registry Editor. Select Yes in the pop-up window asking if you can make changes to your Windows system.\n\nStep 2: The Windows Registry Editor is a large folder that serves as a tool for editing the Windows operating system and its applications.\n\nStep 3: Double-click through the following sequence of folders to find the option you need to select:\n\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\Microsoft Edge\n\nStep 4: Once in the Microsoft Edge folder, options will appear on the right. Double-click the NoRemove option and set the value to 0.\n\nStep 5: Restart your computer.\n\nStep 6: Back in Windows, open the Settings app and follow this path: Apps > Installed Apps > Microsoft Edge.\n\nStep 7: Click the three-dot drop-down menu and the Uninstall option should be highlighted. Select it to begin the uninstall process.\n\nStep 8: You should receive a pop-up confirming that you want to make changes to your device, Select OK. If the deletion process completes, Microsoft Edge will disappear from the settings list.\n\nMicrosoft Edge PowerShell command uninstall\n\nThe PowerShell Command allows you to make changes to the Windows operating system at the administrator level. This is what allows you to make edits to programs like Microsoft Edge because, as an administrator, PowerShell Command has deeper access than a standard user. However, this is an older workaround method, and some users have also reported it may not work as well as it has in the past. So proceed with caution when using this method.\n\nStep 1: Access the Windows File Explorer by selecting the icon or pressing Win+E.\n\nStep 2: Type or paste the following into the address bar of your Windows File Explorer and press Enter.\n\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\n\nStep 3: Open the folder with a numbered name and the most recently modified date. Its name should have a sequence like this: 128.0.2729.76.\n\nStep 4: Find the Installer folder, then right-click and select Copy as path.\n\nStep 5: Open Terminal as an administrator (search Terminal in Start search, right-click, and select Run as Administrator) to open Windows PowerShell.\n\nStep 6: Type cd, then paste the path you copied from the previous folder. If done correctly, it should resemble the following command.\n\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\128.0.2729.76\\Installer\"\n\nStep 7: Press Enter and PowerShell will begin to run the command that will modify the Installer folder.\n\nStep 8: Copy and paste the following command into PowerShell and press Enter.\n\n.\\setup.exe -uninstall -system-level -verbose-logging -force-uninstall*\n\nStep 9: Once the command process is complete, Microsoft Edge should be removed from your desktop.\n\nMicrosoft Edge PowerShell Command uninstall, second option\n\nThis PowerShell Command is an alternate that you can try if the first option does not work. Similarly, both function by working through Microsoft\u2019s administrator level. This method attempts to remove components of Microsoft Edge at the compressed package level. Meanwhile, the first method changes the browser installer functions, creating a force-uninstall. This second option is also an older workaround that may not work or could result in Edge returning in a future update. You should also proceed with caution when using this method.\n\nStep 1: Open Terminal as an administrator (search Terminal in Start search, right-click, and select Run as Administrator)\n\nStep 2: Type or paste the following command into PowerShell and press Enter to begin the process.\n\n*get-appxpackage *edge**\n\nStep 3: Find the option PackageFullName on the left side list and highlight the accompanying data on the right. It should look similar to the command below.\n\nMicrosoft.MicrosoftEdge.Stable_126.0.2641.99_neutral__8wekyb3d8bbwe\n\nStep 4: Copy the text using Ctrl+C on your keyboard.\n\nStep 5: Type \"remove-appxpackage\" at the bottom of the PowerShell window, then paste the command right after that text. It should resemble the following.\n\nRemove-appxpackage Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge.Stable_126.0.2641.99_neutral__8wekyb3d8bbwe\n\nStep 6: Press Enter and allow the command to run. Once complete, Microsoft Edge should be removed from your desktop.\n\nWise program uninstaller for Microsoft Edge\n\nThe Wise uninstaller option is one many people have been using to remove Microsoft Edge on Windows as other options either stop working or begin to cause problems on desktops. This method is also one that creates a force uninstall for Microsoft Edge. The meticulousness of trying to find and manually select the additional Edge-related files to delete increases the chance of causing a boot loop error if Microsoft attempts to reinstall the browser onto your desktop. However, removing all of the extra features doesn\u2019t seem to be necessary. Overall, proceed with caution when using this method.\n\nStep 1: Head to the Wise Program Uninstaller and select Free Download.\n\nStep 2: Accept the terms and the download package will begin.\n\nStep 3: The installer will pop up. Uncheck the first box and press Finish.\n\nStep 4: The Wise Uninstaller program will open. You should see Microsoft Edge in the list of programs.\n\nStep 5: Highlight Microsoft Edge and click Force uninstall. Be sure to create restore points before making any major change to your system.\n\nStep 6: Click Select all in the next pop-up and then Remove to delete additional files.\n\nStep 7: Highlight the Edge icon under browser extensions on the left and uninstall the files listed.\n\nStep 8: Go through all of the tabs and find all of the Microsoft Edge-associated files and uninstall them.\n\nStep 9: Restart your desktop and all Microsoft Edge icons should be removed, indicating that the program is uninstalled.\n\nHow to make sure Microsoft Edge doesn't install itself again\n\nThere is a second step you can take to ensure that Microsoft Edge does not reinstall onto your desktop after you have uninstalled the browser. This method utilizes the Registry Editor from a previous uninstall method, with different steps to ensure that the already uninstalled program won\u2019t return.\n\nStep 1: To open the Windows Registry Editor, go to the Start search box, type \"regedit,\" and select Registry Editor. Select Yes in the pop-up window asking if you can make changes to your Windows system.\n\nStep 2: Double-click through the following sequence of folders to find the option you need to select:\n\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\n\nStep 3: Once at the Microsoft folder, right-click the folder and select New>Key.\n\nStep 4: This will create a new folder. Name the folder \"EdgeUpdate.\" It will be at the end of the list in the Microsoft folder.\n\nStep 5: Now, right-click inside the EdgeUpdate folder on the right and select New>Key.\n\nStep 6: This will create another new file. Name the file \"DoNotUpdateToEdgeWithChromium.\"\n\nStep 7: Double-click the option you just created. This will bring up a pop-up that you must edit. Change the value from 1 to 0 and then press OK.\n\nStep 8: Restart your desktop. This process should prevent Microsoft Edge from reinstalling on your desktop again."
