        "article_content": "f5ve have released their otherworldly new single \u2018UFO\u2019 today (October 17). Ahead of the song\u2019s release, the Japanese girl group spoke to NME about the story behind the new single, their remarkable social media presence and how they\u2019re bringing Japan\u2019s unique subcultures to the world.\n\n\u2018UFO\u2019 comes shortly after f5ve \u2013 originally known as SG5 \u2013 hit the big time with their May 2024 single \u2018Lettuce\u2019, a quirky but scathing diss track to a former lover that\u2019s since become a viral sensation on TikTok. Over a video call from Tokyo, the girl group told NME that \u2018UFO\u2019 tells the story of a girl who is exceptionally skilled at claw machines, which were popularised in Japan during the \u201970s and have since become mainstays at arcades around the world. \u201cThe people watching her start thinking, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s so good, she must be an alien\u2019,\u201d Kaede said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really fun and unique story.\u201d\n\nThe futuristic music video for \u2018UFO\u2019 was filmed in Akihabara \u2013 which member Miyuu describes as the \u201cstarting ground\u201d of Japan\u2019s idol scene \u2013 and finds the girl group performing inside a gacha ball, each of them caked in pale makeup and eerie all-white contact lenses. They soon arrive on earth disguised as humans, but their unnaturally large pupils, awkward movements and fascination with claw machines soon give them away as extraterrestrial beings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn the US, the word \u2018UFO\u2019 makes people think of aliens, but in Japan, it brings to mind things like claw machines and gacha games,\u201d Miyuu said of their alien-like appearance in the music video, explaining that \u201cit\u2019s a playful word association that blends both Japanese and English\u201d which takes inspiration from UFO-related connotations in each language.\n\nDespite being a global-facing act, f5ve unanimously agree on the importance of showcasing Japanese culture in its truest form in their music and visuals. \u201cI believe it\u2019s going to spark a revolution,\u201d said Rui, the youngest of the group. \u201cWe really love and have a lot of confidence in our music and our activities, and we are proud of who we are. We want to bring Japan to the world.\u201d\n\nTake their July single \u2018Underground\u2019, an energetic dance anthem about escaping from societal expectations. Its music video begins with scenes from Tokyo\u2019s busy subway network, with salarymen filing in and out of high-speed trains on their daily commutes. Tired of the monotony on the surface, they escape into the vibrant underground rave scene where they find their place in a sea of colourful outfits and neon lightsticks.\n\nRecommended\n\n\u201cI believe that we stand out because we\u2019re able to really incorporate Japanese culture [in our music] and represent it in an authentic way,\u201d said Sayaka, referencing the \u2018Underground\u2019 and \u2018UFO\u2019 visuals. \u201cI think something unique about us is that we are globally transmitting Japanese culture, which we don\u2019t think any other group is doing right now.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kaede shared that the girl group \u201ctake pride\u201d in their Japanese roots. \u201cWe want to spread the best aspects of J-pop and Japanese culture to the world, and no girl group has really done that before. As representatives of Japan, we want to share our culture and show the real side of who we are to other countries.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor decades, the Japanese music industry has been viewed as unusually insular. While a number of acts, especially in recent years, have managed to break through and find global success \u2013 such as YOASOBI, XG and ATARASHII GAKKO!, among others \u2013 few approach their careers with international audiences in mind, at least not the way their K-pop counterparts do. While those that do, Kaede added, seldom place Japanese culture at the forefront of their craft.\n\n\u201cThis might be something culturally embedded in Japanese people, but I think we aren\u2019t as confident in representing our culture and aren\u2019t aware of how much people overseas are interested in it,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so [some artists] might think that whenever they do something for overseas fans, the content has to be catered to them; the songs have to be in English, they have to do things that are already popular overseas.\u201d\n\nWhile chasing global trends might be a safer shot at success, f5ve are reluctant to do so at the expense of their identity. \u201cI think [following trends] ends up diluting the Japanese cultural aspect,\u201d said Kaede. Instead, they trust that their music will find the right audience while the rest of the world catches up. \u201c[We are] transmitting Japanese culture as it is [and] I think it has hit audiences that have always been interested in Japanese culture and music.\u201d\n\nA huge part of being an international facing group, f5ve shared, is the way they interact with fans on social media. While not every member of the act is fluent in English just yet, they have made it a point to bond with their audience, quickly picking up on popular internet slang and memes. This, in turn, has helped them gain a reputation for being one of the most authentic (and chronically online) J-pop acts around \u2013 and it\u2019s one they\u2019ve embraced whole-heartedly.\n\n\u201cThe reactions from overseas fans are really unique, and they always bring a lot of energy with their support,\u201d Kaede shared with an excited laugh. \u201cWhat stands out to me is how they comment things like \u2018Slay mother\u2019, \u2018Queen\u2019, \u2018Face economy, face card\u2019 to compliment us. Like, I have a bob now, so they said things like \u2018Your bob is fire! Your bob is bobbing!\u2019 to compliment my hairstyle. I find it so inspiring how they express it in such a creative way.\u201d\n\nRuri even joked about how the unfettered way they use social media \u2013 \u201cOur account has less official information than other groups, and we comment on a lot of fans\u2019 posts,\u201d she points out \u2013 has fans confused on whether the accounts really belong to the girl group. \u201cSometimes they don\u2019t think it\u2019s an official account,\u201d she said.\n\nSocial media savvy aside, Ruri believes that much of f5ve\u2019s bond with their fans (called hi-5) is being \u201ctrue to ourselves\u201d. She explained: \u201cEven while we are doing these unique things, we love music and performing. So being honest, having confidence and expressing how much fun we are having. I think that translates directly to fans and creates a strong bond, which I hope will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nAlthough f5ve remained tight-lipped about what\u2019s to come for them, Rui shared her desire to release a catchy anime-inspired track down the line. \u201cAnd we want to sing about Japanese drinking culture,\u201d she added, to which the rest of the group exclaimed: \u201cWe love to drink!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say much yet, but if I could give a little hint, maybe 2025, there will be a big release from f5ve. We have many songs recorded, so please look forward to it,\u201d said Ruri. Wearing a bright smile, Kaede boldly declared: \u201c2025 might be the year of f5ve.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a lot that we want to accomplish with the songs that we currently have. And so we hope that the fans and everyone can look forward to our activities next year and everything that we want to show to the world!\u201d"

        "article_content": "Viktor Tanasiichuk/Getty Images\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market now stands at about $9 trillion, and enterprises have only begun to explore its potential. Leading the way are AI chipmaker Nvidia, and model-maker OpenAI, ultimately competing against each other in the AI race.\n\nThe latest State of AI Report analysis, co-authored by AI investor Nathan Benaich and Alex Chalmers, platform lead at Air Street Capital, details some observations and predictions regarding the current state of AI and what the future may entail for the emerging technology.\n\nAlso: CIOs must also serve as chief AI officers, according to Salesforce survey\n\nTheir predictions for AI in the coming year include the following:\n\n\"An app or website created solely by someone with no coding ability will go viral (e.g. App Store Top 100).\"\n\n\"Frontier labs implement meaningful changes to data collection practices after cases begin reaching trial.\"\n\n\"An open-source alternative to OpenAI o1 surpasses it across a range of reasoning benchmarks.\"\n\n\"Challengers fail to make any meaningful dent in NVIDIA's market position.\"\n\n\"Strong results from Apple's on-device research accelerates momentum around personal on-device AI.\"\n\nBenaich's predictions from past reports have been mainly on target. Among a couple of the misses was a prediction that the \"Gen AI scaling craze will see a group spend more than $1 billion to train a single large-scale model.\" This hasn't happened quite yet, which they admit, but \"let's give it another year.\"\n\nAlso: Think AI can solve all your business problems? Apple's new study shows otherwise\n\nThey also predicted that \"as inference workloads and costs grow significantly, a large AI company (e.g. OpenAI) acquires or builds an inference-focused AI chip company.\" They note that \"Sam Altman is reportedly raising huge sums of money to do this, while each of Google, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft continue to build and improve their owned AI silicon.\"\n\nThe co-authors also looked at the state of AI adoption within enterprises. \"Enterprise automation is set to get an AI-first upgrade,\" they observed. This includes robotic process automation (RPA) juiced by AI.\n\nAlso: OpenAI's Altman sees 'superintelligence' just around the corner - but he's short on details\n\n\"Traditional robotic process automation, embodied by UiPath, has struggled with high set-up costs, brittle execution, and burdensome maintenance,\" they said. \"Two novel approaches, FlowMind (JP Morgan) and ECLAIR (Stanford), use foundation models to address these limitations.\"\n\nFor example, they explained that \"FlowMind achieved 99.5% accuracy in workflow understanding.\" At the same time, \"ECLAIR takes a broader approach, using multimodal models to learn from demonstrations and interact directly with graphical user interfaces across various enterprise settings. On web navigation tasks, ECLAIR improved completion rates from 0% to 40%.\"\n\nBenaich and Chalmers devoted a lot of attention to Nvidia, the leading AI chip producer, and it \"remains the most powerful company in the world, enjoying a stint in the $3-trillion club,\" they observed. \"NVIDIA has already booked significant pre-sales on its new Blackwell family of GPUs and is making a strong play for governments, and its ambitions are only growing.\"\n\nThe other elephant in the AI world, OpenAI, also received a lot of space in the report. \"OpenAI's reign of terror came to an end, until the Strawberry [o1] landed, doubling down on scaling inference compute,\" Benaich and Chalmers wrote, citing OpenAI's latest model. \"OpenAI maintains its edge following the launch of o1, as planning and reasoning emerge as a major frontier.\"\n\nAlso: Welcome to the AI revolution\n\nBy shifting AI compute \"from pre- and post-training to inference, o1 reasons through complex prompts step-by-step in a chain-of-thought (COT) style, employing RL to sharpen the COT and the strategies it uses,\" they added. \"This unlocks the possibility of solving multi-layered math, science, and coding problems where LLMs have historically struggled due to the inherent limitations of next-token prediction.\"\n\nThe AI market is huge at this point. The authors estimate the value of AI companies at $9 trillion \"while investment levels grow healthily in private companies.\" Startups are beginning \"to gain traction in sectors like video and audio generation,\" they added."

Given potential risks like data misuse and security vulnerabilities, the rise of AI agents and their integration into various applications underscores the need for secure identity measures.\n\nOkta\u2019s solution includes user authentication, third-party API integration, and async authentication, allowing on-demand user approvals of AI-generated actions when users are away from their screens.\n\nThe Auth for GenAI product provides fine-grained authorization, ensuring AI systems only access information users can see. This feature is especially relevant as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes more common in GenAI apps, protecting against unintended disclosure of sensitive data.\n\n\u201cOur new product, Auth for GenAI, enables application builders to enjoy securing their GenAI apps with the developer and user experience Auth0 is known for,\u201d said Shiven Ramji, President of Customer Identity Cloud at Okta.\n\nOkta\u2019s developer portal, another upcoming innovation, focuses on making APIs \u2018AI-ready\u2019 by ensuring secure access for developers and their partners.\n\nIn addition to Auth for GenAI, Okta plans to launch a Developer Portal to facilitate the secure exposure of APIs, making products AI-ready. The portal aims to assist companies in accessing APIs securely.\n\nOther innovations include a Universal Logout feature, which automatically terminates user sessions across applications upon logout, and self-service options for Single Sign-On (SSO) and SCIM, enabling IT administrators to set up configurations independently."

        "article_content": "One of the most famous facades in all the world has been concealing a deep secret.\n\nUnderneath the iconic and intricately carved Treasury building at the center of the renowned archaeological site Petra, excavators have stumbled upon a long-lost crypt holding 12 skeletons.\n\nOne of the buried individuals was found clutching the top of a broken ceramic jug.\n\n\"When we spotted what looked like a chalice, all of us just froze,\" recalls American television presenter Josh Gates, who was included in the excavation for a documentary on Discovery Channel.\n\n\"It looked nearly identical to the Holy Grail featured in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, set in the ancient building directly above the tomb. It was the ultimate moment of life imitating art.\"\n\nUnfortunately, this ancient vessel isn't capable of providing eternal youth or infinite abundance, but researchers are still very excited about the catacomb's contents.\n\n\"Little did we know that this dig might completely change what we know about the Treasury,\" says archaeologist Pearce Paul Creasman from the American Center of Research in Jordan.\n\n\"We were absolutely stunned by the revelation of this hidden chamber,\" adds Gates. \"Since nearly all of the tombs at Petra have been found empty, this is perhaps the most significant tomb ever found at Petra and a discovery of historic proportions.\"\n\nThe ancient city of Petra was half-built, half-carved into the sandstone cliffs of a desert canyon in southern Jordan over 2,000 years ago by the Nabateans, a traditionally nomadic Bedouin Arab Tribe.\n\nThe city came to be their capital, which they called Raqmu. It is now one of the new seven wonders of the world, and yet there are many mysteries surrounding the site, which was once a hub of trade between the Mediterranean, Arabia, and Asia.\n\nBy 700 CE, Petra was inexplicably abandoned, and eventually its Treasury building was emptied of artifacts.\n\nAs a result, no one really knows how old the Treasury building is or what it was used for. It's called a treasury because a sculpted urn at the top of the facade was thought to hold riches. This vessel could also, however, be a memorial to royalty.\n\n\"It's fantastic that we now have the pottery, ecofacts, and sediments to date when the Treasury was constructed,\" says environmental scientist Tim Kinnaird from the University of St Andrews.\n\n\"Previously we've worked on assumptions and conjectures \u2013 to have a definitive date will be a monumental achievement for us all.\"\n\nThe discovery of the underground chamber was made by accident, after researchers used ground-penetrating radars to assess flooding risks.\n\nArchaeologists say the tomb was most likely built as a mausoleum and crypt for King Aretas IV Philopatris at the beginning of the 1st century CE.\n\nKing Philopatris was the ruler of the Nabateans from roughly 9 BCE to 40 CE. Under his reign, what was once a community of goat and sheep herders flourished into a kingdom of wealthy merchants, allowing for the lavish construction of many buildings in Petra.\n\nframeborder=\"0\u2033 allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\n\nThis inevitably drew the attention of the Romans. Around 100 CE, the powerful neighboring Empire annexed Petra and renamed it Arabia Petraea. The Romans would rule over the city for the next 300 years, after which the site was gradually abandoned.\n\nIt's not known what happened to the Nabateans after this event. It's likely that the people slowly diffused into Roman society. Much of what we do know about them comes from Roman writings.\n\n\"The discovery is of international significance, as very few complete burials from the early Nabataeans have ever been recovered from Petra before,\" explains geophysicist Richard Bates from St Andrews.\n\n\"The burials, their goods, and the human remains can all be expected to help fill the gaps in our knowledge of how Petra came to be and who the Nabataeans were.\"\n\nThe excavation of the tomb is featured in a two-part program called Excavation Unknown, part of the series Expedition Unknown, which also aired this month on Discovery Channel."

        "article_content": "In this article, we will explore the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024.\n\nThe Software Industry: An Analysis\n\nThe software market is experiencing robust growth, driven by various trends and technological advancements. According to Precedence Research, the global software market size reached $659.17 billion in 2023\u200b. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.8% during 2024 \u2013 2034 to reach $2.24 trillion by \u200bthe end of the forecast period. In 2023, the North American region led the software market, holding a substantial share of 44%. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period.\n\nA key factor influencing the market is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). AI technologies are being integrated into software solutions to enhance efficiency and automate repetitive tasks. A study from Salesforce reveals that 85% of IT leaders expect AI to boost developer productivity over the next three years. This expectation underscores the growing recognition of AI\u2019s role in streamlining workflows and optimizing software performance.\n\nAnother significant trend is the shift towards cloud-based software. Companies are migrating from traditional on-premises solutions to cloud services due to their flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This transition allows businesses to access applications remotely and across various devices, which has become crucial in today\u2019s digital landscape.\n\nThe 2024 AlgoSec State of Network Security report highlights a notable shift towards multi-cloud environments. The research, based on surveys conducted in H2 of 2022 and 2023, evaluated major players like AWS and Microsoft Azure. It indicates that security, continuity, and compliance are key factors driving organizations to adopt cloud platforms. While cloud adoption is growing, Azure remains the most popular platform, with AWS rapidly gaining ground.\n\nThe report also reveals that the move to remote work has significantly boosted Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) deployment, dropping the percentage of organizations without SD-WAN from 55.2% in 2022 to 34% in 2023. Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) has become a popular solution for organizations by consolidating security functions into a unified cloud service. Additionally, firewall implementation has surged, with only 7.1% of respondents reporting no firewalls in 2023, down from 28.4% in 2022. This trend reflects a growing focus on securing cloud networks against external threats.\n\nWith an overview of the global software market in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024, we used stock screeners from Finviz and Yahoo Finance. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 50 largest software companies by market cap.\n\nTo narrow down our list to high-growth software stocks, we focused on companies with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in net revenue exceeding 18% over the past 5 years.\n\nNext, we focused on profitability. From this initial list of high-growth software stocks, we narrowed our choices to stocks that had positive trailing twelve-month (TTM) net income and stocks that have grown their net income positively over the past 5 years.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of our findings, we consulted reputable sources such as SeekingAlpha, which provided insights into the net income CAGR and revenue CAGR over the past five years, and YCharts, which offered information on TTM net income.\n\nFinally, from this list of high-growth software stocks that met our criteria, we focused on the top 8 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 elite hedge funds. The 8 high-growth software stocks that are profitable in 2024 are ranked below in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\n8 High Growth Software Stocks That Are Profitable In 2024\n\n8.
