        "article_content": "Junji Ito knows a thing or two about horror. From supernatural haunts to demonic curses, the award-winning artist has seen it all. Ito is not called a Master of Horror for no reason, but even with his work in mind, Ito is not invulnerable to scares. The manga artist has a few boundaries, and it turns out aliens are near the top of that list.\n\nSeriously, don\u2019t test him. Ito wants nothing to do with aliens. And if you are ever given the chance to talk with an extraterrestrial, Ito is begging you to turn the other way.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nJunji Ito Wants Nothing to Do With Aliens\n\nIn a recent interview with Viz Media, Ito unloaded his distrust of aliens when asked whether he believes we are alone in the universe. The artist makes it clear that he believes aliens exist, but Ito doesn\u2019t want humanity making first contact.\n\n\u201cThe universe is vast, so I believe some life form exists somewhere, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re alone,\u201d Ito said. He goes on to talk about humanity\u2019s first contact, and Ito asks those watching to never engage with an alien.\n\n\u201cWhatever you do, do not respond. Otherwise, we will open ourselves up to a terrifying alien invasion,\u201d the artist explained. \u201cHold your breath and never make contact, otherwise horrible things will happen.\u201d\n\nClearly, Ito feels strongly about aliens, and there is nothing positive about it. The artist is on the mind that aliens exist, but humanity is not in a place where we should be contacting them. While first contact may have gone over well enough in series like Star Trek, Ito doesn\u2019t think real life will be so kind. Invasion is a real threat, and Ito thinks contacting aliens will make such an ambush likely.\n\nIto Has Already Explored Alien Horror Through His Manga\n\nGiven Ito\u2019s wariness of aliens, it is not surprising to see that fear reflected in his work. The artist has dozens of manga to his name, and several of them dabble with aliens. For instance, his manga Sensor is tied to extraterrestrials as it was inspired by a UFO rumor in Ito\u2019s hometown.\n\n\u201cThe theory was that it was dropped by a UFO and I thought it was interesting,\u201d Ito told Polygon, referring to the strange objects at the center of Sensor. The manga follows a group of locals who head out at night to find glowing, golden strands of hair raining from the sky. When Ito was a kid, he experienced this phenomenon for real, but the \u2018hair\u2019 was actually fallout from a nearby volcanic eruption. Still, rumors went around town that aliens were to blame, and the gossip struck a chord with Ito.\n\nThe artist has also explored aliens and extraterrestrial horror with Remina, a manga released in 2004. The story follows several scientists as they discover a planet is on course to collide with our own solar system. As the planet comes closer, experts discover it is not some land mass but rather a massive alien that wishes to consume Earth. Thanks to its unsettling story and raw visuals, Remina is considered a horror classic, and Ito has won a number of awards with the manga including an Eisner Award.\n\nThere is no denying Ito\u2019s history with aliens, and he would love to keep it fictional. The artist doesn\u2019t have great feelings about first contact, and honestly, who can blame him? The horror icon has thought up the worst endgames imaginable so far as aliens are concerned. So if you happen upon an alien some day, remember Ito\u2019s warning.\n\nWhat do you make of Ito\u2019s warning here? Do you agree with his take on First Contact? Give me a shout at @meganwpeters with your take! You can also let us know what you think over on X (Twitter) and Instagram.\n\n"

It\u2019s difficult to understand how these black holes were able to grow so big so rapidly. But with the discovery of a low-mass supermassive black hole feasting on material at an extreme rate, seen just 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang, astronomers now have valuable new insights into the mechanisms of rapidly growing black holes in the early Universe.\n\nLID-568 was discovered by a cross-institutional team of astronomers led by International Gemini Observatory/NSF NOIRLab astronomer Hyewon Suh. They used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to observe a sample of galaxies from the Chandra X-ray Observatory\u2019s COSMOS legacy survey. This population of galaxies is very bright in the X-ray part of the spectrum, but are invisible in the optical and near-infrared. JWST\u2019s unique infrared sensitivity allows it to detect these faint counterpart emissions.\n\nLID-568 stood out within the sample for its intense X-ray emission, but its exact position could not be determined from the X-ray observations alone, raising concerns about properly centering the target in JWST\u2019s field of view. So, rather than using traditional slit spectroscopy, JWST\u2019s instrumentation support scientists suggested that Suh\u2019s team use the integral field spectrograph on JWST\u2019s NIRSpec. This instrument can get a spectrum for each pixel in the instrument\u2019s field of view rather than being limited to a narrow slice.\n\n\u201cOwing to its faint nature, the detection of LID-568 would be impossible without JWST. Using the integral field spectrograph was innovative and necessary for getting our observation,\u201d says Emanuele Farina, International Gemini Observatory/NSF NOIRLab astronomer and co-author of the paper appearing in Nature Astronomy.\n\nJWST\u2019s NIRSpec allowed the team to get a full view of their target and its surrounding region, leading to the unexpected discovery of powerful outflows of gas around the central black hole. The speed and size of these outflows led the team to infer that a substantial fraction of the mass growth of LID-568 may have occurred in a single episode of rapid accretion. \u201cThis serendipitous result added a new dimension to our understanding of the system and opened up exciting avenues for investigation,\u201d says Suh.\n\nIn a stunning discovery, Suh and her team found that LID-568 appears to be feeding on matter at a rate 40 times its Eddington limit. This limit relates to the maximum luminosity that a black hole can achieve, as well as how fast it can absorb matter, such that its inward gravitational force and outward pressure generated from the heat of the compressed, infalling matter remain in balance. When LID-568\u2019s luminosity was calculated to be so much higher than theoretically possible, the team knew they had something remarkable in their data.\n\n\u201cThis black hole is having a feast,\u201d says International Gemini Observatory/NSF NOIRLab astronomer and co-author Julia Scharw\u00e4chter. \u201cThis extreme case shows that a fast-feeding mechanism above the Eddington limit is one of the possible explanations for why we see these very heavy black holes so early in the Universe.\u201d\n\nThese results provide new insights into the formation of supermassive black holes from smaller black hole \u2018seeds\u2019, which current theories suggest arise either from the death of the Universe\u2019s first stars (light seeds) or the direct collapse of gas clouds (heavy seeds). Until now, these theories lacked observational confirmation. \u201cThe discovery of a super-Eddington accreting black hole suggests that a significant portion of mass growth can occur during a single episode of rapid feeding, regardless of whether the black hole originated from a light or heavy seed,\u201d says Suh.\n\nThe discovery of LID-568 also shows that it\u2019s possible for a black hole to exceed its Eddington limit, and provides the first opportunity for astronomers to study how this happens. It\u2019s possible that the powerful outflows observed in LID-568 may be acting as a release valve for the excess energy generated by the extreme accretion, preventing the system from becoming too unstable. To further investigate the mechanisms at play, the team is planning follow-up observations with JWST.\n\nMore information\n\nThis research was presented in a paper entitled \u201cA super-Eddington-accreting black hole ~1.5 Gyr after the Big Bang observed with JWST\u201d to appear in Nature Astronomy.

DOI: 10.1038/s41591-024-03185-2\n\nA picture may be worth a thousand words, but they both have a lot of work to do to catch up to BiomedGPT. A Lehigh University research team has now collaborated with Massachusetts General Hospital in an effort to transform medical text and images into faster disease diagnosis, enhanced medical reporting, improved drug discovery, and more.\n\nCovered recently in the journal Nature Medicine, BiomedGPT is a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to support a wide range of medical and scientific tasks. This new study, conducted in collaboration with multiple institutions, is described in the article as \"the first open-source and lightweight vision\u2013language foundation model, designed as a generalist capable of performing various biomedical tasks.\"\n\n\"This work combines two types of AI into a decision support tool for medical providers,\" explains Lichao Sun, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at Lehigh University and a lead author of the study. \"One side of the system is trained to understand biomedical images, and one is trained to understand and assess biomedical text.\n\n\"The combination of these allows the model to tackle a wide range of biomedical challenges, using insight gleaned from databases of biomedical imagery and from the analysis and synthesis of scientific and medical research reports.\"\n\nState-of-the-art results for medical practitioners and patients\n\nThe key innovation described in the article is that this AI model doesn't need to be specialized for each task. Typically, AI systems are trained for specific jobs, like recognizing tumors in X-rays or summarizing medical papers. However, this new model can handle many different tasks using the same underlying technology. This versatility makes it a \"generalist\" model\u2014and a powerful new tool in the hands of medical providers.\n\n\"BiomedGPT is based on foundation models, a recent development in AI,\" says Sun. \"Foundation models are large, pre-trained AI systems that can be adapted to various tasks with minimal additional training. The generalist model described in the article has been trained on vast amounts of biomedical data, including images and text, enabling it to perform well across different applications.\"\n\n\"By evaluating 25 datasets across 9 biomedical tasks and different modalities,\" says Kai Zhang, a Lehigh Ph.D. student advised by Sun, who serves as first author of the article.\n\nZhang says that he is proud that the open-source codebase is available for other researchers to use as a springboard to drive further development and adoption.\n\nThe team reports that the technology behind BiomedGPT may one day help doctors by interpreting complex medical images, assist researchers by analyzing scientific literature, or even aid in drug discovery by predicting how molecules behave.\n\n\"The potential impact of such technology is significant,\" Zhang says, \"as it could streamline many aspects of health care and research, making them faster and more accurate. Our method demonstrates that effective training with diverse data can lead to more practical biomedical AI for improving diagnosis and workflow efficiency.\"\n\nA team effort for clinical validation, and more\n\nA crucial step in the process was validation of the model's effectiveness and applicability in real-world health care settings.\n\n\"Clinical testing involves applying the AI model to real patient data to assess its accuracy, reliability, and safety,\" Sun says. \"This testing ensures that the model performs well across different scenarios. The outcomes of these tests helped refine the model, demonstrating its potential to improve clinical decision-making and patient care.\"\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH) played a crucial role in the development and validation of the BiomedGPT model. The institution's involvement primarily focused on providing clinical expertise and facilitating the evaluation of the model's effectiveness in real-world health care settings.\n\nFor instance, the model was tested with radiologists at MGH, where it demonstrated superior performance in tasks like visual question answering and radiology report generation. This collaboration helped ensure that the model was both accurate and practical for clinical use.\n\nOther contributors to BiomedGPT include researchers from University of Georgia, Samsung Research America, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, University of Central Florida, UC-Santa Cruz, University of Texas-Health, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and the Mayo Clinic.\n\n\"This research is highly interdisciplinary and collaborative,\" says Sun. \"The research involves expertise from multiple fields, including computer science, medicine, radiology, and biomedical engineering. Each author contributes specialized knowledge necessary to develop, test, and validate the model across various biomedical tasks. Large-scale projects like this often require access to diverse datasets and computational resources, along with access to skills in algorithm development, model training, evaluation, and application to real-world scenarios, as well as clinical testing and validation.\"\n\n\"This was a true team effort,\" he says. \"Creating something that can truly help the medical community improve patient outcomes across a wide range of issues is a very complex challenge. With such complexity, collaboration is key to creating impact through the application of science and engineering.\"\n\nMore information: Kai Zhang et al, A generalist vision\u2013language foundation model for diverse biomedical tasks, Nature Medicine (2024).

Although it\u2019s not the update people have been waiting for, it\u2019s still important.\n\nAccording to SamMobile, a new software update is being rolled out for the carrier-locked versions of the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra. The firmware version for this update is S92xUSQS4AXJA, and it includes the November 2024 security patch. This update addresses multiple security vulnerabilities, but does not introduce any new features. Instead, it resolves dozens of security issues identified in the previous software version.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nLast week, Samsung released the same update for the Galaxy Tab S7 FE.\n\nAlthough the new security update is important, users have been patiently waiting for the next release, One UI 7. This update, based on Android 15, will offer a refreshed design and enhanced features for Galaxy devices. It includes several redesigned icons and a new camera user interface.\n\nOne UI 7 includes modifications such as a pill for system apps on the home screen, reminiscent of Apple\u2019s Dynamic Island. However, unlike Apple, which places its similar feature at the top center of the screen, Samsung\u2019s Dynamic Island will be located on the left side of the notification area.\n\nOnce expected to arrive earlier this year, One UI 7 might not launch until early next year. According to reliable tipster Ice Universe, Samsung is expected to release the first One UI 7 beta to testers in the coming weeks. Although many anticipated this launch in July, it has been delayed by several months.\n\nTo check for the new security update on your Galaxy S24 series device, go to Settings and then navigate to Software Update."
