Eerie \u2018UFO cloud\u2019 shocks Brits as rare phenomenon lurks over UK town for 10 minutes before disappearing\n\nA MYSTERIOUS cloud, shaped just like an alien spaceship, has been spotted hovering over the UK.\n\nThe strange sighting has been likened by onlookers to something out of sci-fi horror movie Nope, in which humans are sucked up and eaten by an otherworldly monster.\n\n2 This cloud is often what reports of UFOs turn out to be Credit: SWNS\n\nBut the cloud isn't anything sinister.\n\nIt's actually a rare phenomenon known as a lenticular cloud.\n\nCivil servant Dave Pickett, 38, and his son Blake, 7, snapped the moment before it quickly disappeared as it flew above Greenfield, near Oldham in Greater Manchester on Friday.\n\n\"We agreed it looked like a spaceship,\" he said.\n\n\"It wasn't the same ten minutes later, when the sky lost its colour as the sun was rising.\n\n\"I got lucky and had my phone to hand.\"\n\nHe added: \"I\u2019d never seen anything like it.\n\n\u201cA friend commented that it was a lenticular cloud, I had never heard of it.\n\n\"It reminded me of Nope. A cloud-looking UFO which turned out to be a big balloon thing.\"\n\nLenticular clouds usually fly between 6,500 to 16,500 ft off the ground.\n\nI\u2019m an Area 51 investigator \u2013 FBI raided my home & tried to silence me but I know secret UFO base is hiding new weapons\n\nThey can appear in the sky if a series of events with air and mountains occurs.\n\nWhen winds encounter a mountain it can create a train of large standing waves in the air downstream.\n\nIf there is sufficient moisture in the air, the rising motion of the wave will cause water vapour to condense, which causes lenticular clouds to appear.\n\nThey're believed to be one of the most common explanation for UFO sightings, according to the Met Office.\n\nPilots usually avoid flying near them in possible as they can result in increased turbulence."

Looks like there\u2019s lots of reflection on the side of the vehicle. Not sure if that\u2019s from traffics or what.\"\n\nWhile another thought: \"It was just something tied to the door tied tight to hold it open. If you watch the door starts to close right before it happened.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThen a third argued: \"Not... really. Just actually look at the reflection and you see it actually goes on a lot longer than the 'object'.\n\n\"What likely happened here is the guy got knocked out by something from inside, or got electrocuted and jumped back.\n\n\"And at the exact same time some bug lit up in front of the camera.\"\n\nThe clip has divided the viewers (Reddit/u/kamm03)\n\nAdvert\n\nSomeone else also questioned: \"Idk.. the fact that the dog goes immediately towards where the object came from kinda freaks me out. Right after that, the dog does move to the body on the ground but its attention is immediately taken to that area. I wonder if the dog's sniffer picked something up.\"\n\n\"The eagle eyes that spotted the object circling around the cement mixer help confirmed depth and motion,\" a fifth added. \"This is a bug that is flying to the left, then towards the camera then up and over the top right edge of the camera nearly directly at it. Velocity and size of the object increase relatively proportionally to each other.\"\n\nWhatever your opinion, we can surely all agree how weird it is?"

            "article_content": "1.The last surviving witness to President Abraham Lincoln's assassination in 1865 was alive during your grandparents' and/or parents' lifetime.\n\nUniversal History Archive / Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nHis name was Samuel J. Seymour. He was just 5 years old at the time and was at Ford Theatre the night Lincoln was assassinated. In February 1956, at age 95, Samuel appeared on the TV game show I've Got a Secret and told his story (he would die a few months later).\n\nAnd fun fact: Samuel also had two very famous people try to guess his secret. Audrey Meadows, who starred in the classic sitcom The Honeymooners and the ICONIC Lucille Ball.\n\n2.Contrary to popular belief, Cleopatra was NOT a box office bomb; in fact, it was the highest-grossing film of 1963. The issue was that the film was so expensive to make, it really didn't turn a profit.\n\nSilver Screen Collection / Getty Images\n\nAt the time, the movie cost $42 million to make (which, when adjusted for inflation, is around $433,264,313 million in today's money). There were several reasons the cost got out of control, including the elaborate costumes and sets, production delays, and Elizabeth Taylor's health, which forced the already-built sets to be moved from cold rainy London to sunny Rome.\n\n20thcentfox / \u00a920thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nCleopatra was so costly that it almost bankrupted 20th Century Fox \u2014 which was forced to sell 300 acres of its backlot to stay afloat. That area is now modern-day Century City.\n\nGeorge Rose / Getty Images\n\n3.The Wizard of Oz was not a box office hit when it was released in 1939. Like Cleopatra, it was a very expensive movie to make and had a hard time recouping its money at the box office. It cost close to $3 million dollars to make (including promotional costs), and as the LA Times pointed out, it needed to make that back when the average movie theater ticket cost 25 cents for adults and 15 cents for kids.\n\nWarner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nThe film would eventually make a profit when it was re-released 10 years later, in 1949.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection\n\nHowever, the reason the film has become such an iconic piece of pop culture is that starting in 1956, it began having yearly TV showings that helped introduce it to new generations of kids over the decades (especially since this was in the pre-home video time).\n\nThe picture above is of Judy Garland's daughters, Liza Minnelli and Lorna Luft, watching the very first airing of The Wizard of Oz on TV in 1956. Cbs Photo Archive / Getty Images\n\n4.The whole Roswell crash incident was mostly forgotten for over 30 years after the United States Air Force issued an almost immediate retraction that they had not recovered a crashed UFO in Roswell, New Mexico, and that it had been debris from a downed weather balloon.\n\nUniversal History Archive / Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nIt wasn't until the late '70s and early '80s that interest in Roswell was renewed after the National Enquirer ran the uncorrected original news story about the alleged crash. There were also several books, like The Roswell Incident, that were published about it that further delved into it being a huge government cover-up.\n\nDavid Zaitz / Getty Images\n\nMost everything we think about when we think of the \"Roswell crash,\" like the alien bodies, a nurse seeing them (who later died in suspicious circumstances), the military base being on high alert and filled with strange debris, came from an episode of Unsolved Mysteries. Those things mentioned in the episode came from Glenn Dennis, who was a mortician in Roswell in 1947 and claimed to have been contacted by the Air Force for child-sized hermetically sealed caskets and asked how to preserve bodies exposed to the elements, and that he was also friends with the nurse who saw the alien bodies first-hand.\n\nIt should be noted that Dennis never talked about all of these things until either 1989 or 1990 (over 40 years after the supposed crash). Also, his story changed a lot over the years with researchers finding many inconsistencies (like the name of the nurse) and inaccuracies in it. NBC\n\n5.The Phoenix Lights is thought to be the most witnessed UFO sighting ever. Thousands of people in Arizona and Nevada reported seeing the two separate incidents that make up the Phoenix Lights.\n\nazfamily powered by 3TV & CBS5AZ / Via youtube.com\n\nIt happened on March 13, 1997, at around 8 p.m.; people began reporting seeing a very large V-shaped object (with three lights on the bottom of each side and one in the front) flying very slowly and silently over the towns of Prescott and Dewey, Arizona. A couple of hours later, at around 10 p.m., a series of red and orange lights appeared to hover above Phoenix.\n\nCris180 / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nAs I said above, this was witnessed by thousands of people, including Kurt Russell \u2014 who was actually an unnamed pilot who reported what he was seeing to the airport. Russell happened to be flying his plane with his son, Oliver, when they came across the lights. He went on to say that he and Oliver never spoke about it, and he never really thought about it until a few years later when his wife, Goldie Hawn, was watching a TV show that was doing a piece on the Phoenix Lights and that's when it all came back to him.\n\nYou can watch Kurt talk about it here. BBC / Via youtube.com\n\nEventually, the US Air Force came forward to say that they were responsible for the incident, admitting that lights were leftover high-intensity flares dropped during a training exercise. Although, lots of people who witnessed the Phoenix Lights are skeptical of that explanation to this day.\n\nU.s. Navy / Getty Images\n\n6.In 1960, Psycho changed how people watched movies in theaters \u2014 and it's how we watch them today. Before 1960, it was common for people to buy a ticket and drop into a theater at any point during a movie. Movies played on loops repeatedly, so if you only caught the last half-hour of a movie, you would just stay in your seat and wait for it to play again so you could watch what you missed. Directors and studios hated that, but it's how people were used to going to the movies. However, that posed a problem for Psycho.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection / Courtesy\n\nOne of the big twists in Psycho is that Janet Leigh's character, Marion Crane, is murdered in the shower halfway through the film. Janet was the movie's most famous star, so having her killed would shock and confuse the audience and make them not know what to expect next. Alfred Hitchcock had gone to great lengths to keep the plot a complete secret, so he wanted people not to have the film spoiled by coming in after that shower scene.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection / Everett Collection / Everett Collection\n\nJerry Pickman, who was the then-vice president of advertising and publicity at Paramount, came up with an ingenious way to both market the film and ensure people watched the movie from the beginning. He created an ad campaign (like the poster seen below) that featured Hitchcock telling people that they not only had to watch Psycho from the beginning but also that theaters would refuse to let anyone in after the movie had started.\n\nThe campaign worked. People arrived to the theaters on time and watched the movie from start to finish. After that, theaters slowly started setting start times for movies, as audiences were now conditioned after Psycho to get there before the movie started. Paramount/ Courtesy Everett Collection\n\n7.Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone in The Godfather is considered legendary and has gone down in cinematic history as such. But he almost didn't get the part of Vito because at the time, he was considered a temperamental, washed-up actor, whom the studio refused to hire. And for his part, Brando initially wasn't interested and didn't really want to work.\n\nParamount / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nIn fact, it was truly a series of events that got Brando cast in the role. The film's director, Francis Ford Coppola, was dead set on casting either Brando or Laurence Olivier as Vito. When he was told no to casting Brando by Paramount\u2019s then-president, Stanley Jaffe, Coppola faked a stress-induced epilepsy in Jaffe's office. After that stunt, Jaffe reconsidered and told him he would consider Brando for the role on three conditions \u2014 with one of them being that he would need to screen-test for it.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection\n\nMeanwhile, Mario Puzo, who wrote The Godfather novel, read a story that comedian\u2013sitcom star\u2013producer Danny Thomas was interested in buying a majority share in Paramount with the sole purpose of casting himself as Vito. That caused an alarmed Puzo to write a letter to Brando \u2014 whom he had envisioned in the role \u2014 and plead with him to consider the role of Vito. Brando's personal secretary, Alice Marchak, knew that he needed to work because he was deeply in debt, so she bought a subscription to the Hollywood Reporter to keep tabs on potential roles for him. However, he caught her reading it one day and got mad that she would bring \"movie magazines into [his] house.\" So she left his house and let him cool off for a few days, during which time she read that Paramount was looking to cast the role of Vito in The Godfather. When she came back to Brando's house, she found Puzo's letter in the mail.\n\nPerson in formal tuxedo holds an award statue, standing in front of a large statue at an event\n\nPerson smiling, wearing a blue suit with a tie and white shirt, in front of a plain background\n\nBettmann / Bettmann Archive, Abc Photo Archives / Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPuzo and Brando would eventually talk over the phone, and by then, Marchak had read the book and knew the role was right for him. She also slowly played to Brando's ego by commenting to him about all his fellow actors who were being considered for the role \u2014 causing him to want the part even more.\n\nEventually, he agreed to it, but Coppola knew he would need to screen-test him in order to cast him (something that would be an insult to an actor of Brando's stature). So he devised a plan in which he didn't tell Brando it was a screen test, but instead told him that he wanted to come over to his house to try some things for the camera, experiment a bit, and try some improvisation. And that worked. When Coppola finally did the not-a-screen-test-at-all at Brando's house, he saw the 47-year-old actor transform into Vito in front of his eyes as he smeared black shoe polish on his blonde hair to give it a darker and greased-back look, gave himself a shoe polish mustache, and put wads of tissue in his cheeks to give himself an appearance of a bulldog. The rest, of course, is movie history.\n\n/ Everett Collection / Everett Collection\n\n8.The iconic boulder-rolling scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark is an homage to a very similar thing that happened in the 1954 Scrooge McDuck comic \"The Seven Cities of Cibola.\" In the comic, Scrooge, Huey, Dewey, and Louie travel to a lost city, where they find an emerald idol. However, noticing it is booby-trapped, they decide not to take it. What they don't realize is that they have been followed by the Beagle Boys, who decide to steal the idol, which sets off a giant boulder that chases after them.\n\nCbs Photo Archive / CBS via Getty Images\n\nGeorge Lucas \u2014 who came up with Indiana Jones \u2014 was a big fan of the Scrooge McDuck comics (which were created by Carl Barks) growing up and told Edward Summer, a writer who put together a book of Barks' Scrooge comics, that the boulder scene in Raiders was a \"conscious homage\" to \"The Seven Cities of Cibola.\"\n\nFantagraphics / Via amazon.com Walt Disney\n\nIn a sort of full-circle moment, the Raiders logo would go on to inspire the DuckTales one (which of course is a classic cartoon series about Scrooge McDuck's adventures):\n\n9.The classic scene in The Seven Year Itch, where Marilyn Monroe's dress is lifted up by the air from a subway grate, had to be reshot in California at 20th Century Fox's studios.\n\n20th Century Fox Film Corp. All rights reserved. Courtesy: Everett Collection.\n\nThe scene was originally filmed on location in New York City, but there were over 2,000 spectators on the street watching the scene being filmed, and they would yell every time her skirt went up. The noise coming from the crowd made it impossible for director Billy Wilder to use any takes from it.\n\nBettmann / Bettmann Archive / Getty Images\n\nWhile the iconic image of Marilyn's dress billowing up is one of the first things we think about when we think of her, it's actually not shown like that in the movie. In the film, you really don't see anything more than her knees as the dress flows up. However, the full body shot images were used in posters and promotional material for the movie.\n\nTM & Copyright \u00a920th Century Fox Film Corp. / courtesy Everett Collection\n\n10.Dolly Parton secretly produced one of the most iconic and influential shows of all time: Buffy the Vampire Slayer!!!\n\nGetty Images/ Online USA\n\nThe show was produced by Sandollar Entertainment, a production company that Dolly cofounded with her friend and business partner Sandy Gallin (on the right), in 1986.\n\nRon Galella, Ltd. / Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images\n\nIn fact, Sandollar had produced the original movie it was based on, so they owned the rights to it. Gail Berman, who was the then-president and CEO of Sandollar Television, always thought it would be a great TV series. Since Joss Whedon wrote the script to the film, Sandollar was contractually obligated to offer him the opportunity to helm the series. According to Berman, she and Whedon were on the same page about Buffy, with eventually Dolly and Sandy (as heads of the production company) getting involved to help make the series happen.\n\n20thcentfox / \u00a920thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nBerman went on to be an executive producer on Buffy, as well as its spinoff Angel, and left Sandollar shortly thereafter to focus on the shows. After leaving, Berman had lunch with Dolly, where she complained that men at the company had not given her her fair share of the Buffy royalties. Dolly then handed her a check to cover what she was owed.\n\nAraya Doheny / WireImage / Getty Images\n\n11.\"Believe\" is not only one of the most iconic songs of the '90s, but also one that would change music forever. However, Cher wasn't interested in doing a dance song. Still, Rob Dickins, who was the then-president of her label, Warner Music U.K., felt that since her last album (which was rock ballads) had been a disappointment, she should focus on her gay audience and told her to do a dance album. Dickins then reached out to songwriter Brian Higgins to submit songs for a Cher dance album, and \"Believe\" was among one of the songs he sent in.\n\nAfter several rewrites, Cher recorded the song. However, she was unaware that the producers, Mark Taylor and Brian Rawling, had created a version with the signature Auto-Tune effect in it. Afraid that Cher would HATE the Auto-Tune sound, they only shared it with her after having a few beers. Cher loved it and told them to keep it in. Dickins, however, disliked the Auto-Tune sound and told them to take it out. When Cher found out that they were going to take the Auto-Tune effect out, she said, \"You can change that part of it, over my dead body! Don't let anyone touch this track, or I'm going to rip your throat out.\"\n\nJmenternational / Getty Images\n\n12.Tim Burton was supposed to direct a third Batman movie that was reportedly called Batman Continues. The movie would have featured Michael Keaton as Batman, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, and Billy Dee Williams as Two Face.\n\nWarner Bros / \u00a9Warner Bros/courtesy Everett Collection / Everett Collection\n\nEven though Batman Returns was well received by critics and a hit at the box office, Burton was asked to step down by Warner Bros. from making a third Batman movie after parents complained about Batman Returns being too dark and him refusing to make the next film lighter.\n\nWarner Bros / \u00c2\u00a9Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nWarner Bros. also passed on making a Catwoman spinoff film that would've had Pfeiffer reprising the role. The film also would have been directed by Burton and written by the same writer who wrote Batman Returns.\n\nWarner Bros. wanted to keep the Batman franchise family friendly, and the spinoff would have been as dark Batman Returns. Warner Bros / \u00c2\u00a9Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nJoel Schumacher was brought on by Warner Bros. to helm the Batman franchise. And while it was reported that Michael Keaton didn't want to return to the role because Tim Burton was no longer involved, that wasn't exactly the case. In an interview with In the Envelope: The Actor's Podcast in 2022, Keaton said that he did talk to Schumacher about a third film, but that the two clashed over the direction of the character. Schumacher wanted a more comics-style story, while Keaton wanted to continue to tell the Batman story he created with Burton.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWarner Bros / \u00a9Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection, Warner Bros / \u00a9Warner Bros/courtesy Everett Collection / Everett Collection\n\nWith Keaton gone, Schumacher recast Val Kilmer in the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, as well as Chris O'Donnell in the role of Dick Grayson/Robin. Originally, Marlon Wayans had signed on to play Robin in what would've been Burton's third Batman film.\n\nRon Galella, Ltd. / Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images, Warner Bros / \u00a9Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nHowever, Wayans gets residuals for Batman Forever, even though he does NOT appear in the movie. Per a clause in his contract, he was guaranteed to be paid his salary plus residuals, even if he was recast.\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer / Getty Images\n\n13.From 1977 until her death in 1994, Jackie Kennedy Onassis was a very successful and well-respected book editor at Doubleday. In 1983, executives at Doubleday came up with the idea of having Michael Jackson write his autobiography, and they asked Jackie to help get him to agree to sign and spearhead it. A mega-famous pop star's memoir would not be the type of book Jackie would ever want to be involved with, but she understood that Doubleday having a huge commercial book would help get her passion projects published. By all accounts, she would go on to regret ever agreeing to get involved.\n\nJackie Kennedy Onassis and older man smiling at an event, man in a formal suit with bowtie\n\nMichael Jackson poses with a snake wrapped around his shoulders, wearing a white shirt\n\nSonia Moskowitz / Getty Images, Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter an initial meeting with Michael at the Jackson family home in Encino, California, Jackie was able to secure the book deal. Michael got a $300K advance, total control over the book, and a foreward written by Jackie (which was something she initially refused to do but went on to agree to). According to Shaye Areheart, who was Jackie's editorial assistant at the time, dealing with Michael was \"a huge nightmare,\" and he seemed uninterested in actually working on the book, which caused it to be delayed.\n\nSonia Moskowitz / Getty Images\n\nMichael also began calling Jackie at her home in Martha's Vineyard to have long phone conversations with her to complain about the difficulties of being famous. Jackie, who was notoriously private, refused to engage with him on that topic. She went on to tell her friend Edward Kasinec that \"Michael Jackson is driving me mad with his phone calls.\" Eventually, Michael submitted his first manuscript, which he worked on with his first ghostwriter. The manuscript was much shorter than they anticipated and featured nothing revealing about himself other than \"fluff.\" Jackie rejected the manuscript and called Michael and told him he needed to open up and be sincere because if it was just a book about how great and successful he was, then \"we'd all be made fools of.\" Michael agreed and got a new ghostwriter.\n\nBettmann / Bettmann Archive / Getty Images\n\nUnhappy with his second manuscript, he began editing parts of it with Jackie's assistant, Shaye, who flew around the world to finish it. Eventually, they were able to finish the second manuscript and get it ready to be published. But Michael then decided he didn't want to publish the book. However, they were able to convince him to do so, and in 1988, his autobiography Moonwalk was published and went on to be No. 1 on the New York Times Best Sellers list and sell out all 500,000 copies printed. Even though it was hugely successful, Michael, who had full control, refused to allow Doubleday to print more copies or a paperback version.\n\nUltimately, it was seen as a huge success for Jackie, too. However, while working on the autobiography, she left a message on J. C. Suar\u00e8s' (the book's designer) answering machine, asking herself why the hell she had ever got involved with the book. Crown Archetype / Via amazon.com\n\n14.It was shooting Harriet the Spy that led Rosie O'Donnell to create The Rosie O'Donnell Show \u2014 but it was actually more out of necessity. The film was shot in Toronto and had long hours. At the end of the shooting days, Rosie noticed that her infant son, Parker, was more attached to their housekeeper. This made her realize she needed a New York\u2013based job with shorter hours in order to spend more time with him.\n\nParamount / \u00a9Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nSo, Rosie came up with the idea of doing a daytime talk show as the solution. As Vulture puts it, it was a \"then-radical daytime-television experiment\" to do a talk show that was centered on interviewing celebrities and engaging with the live studio audience. But it worked, and the show would go on to change television\n\nFrank Micelotta Archive / Getty Images\n\n15.Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis paid for two Forrest Gump scenes (one was the scene where Forrest runs across the US) to be filmed out of their own pockets. According to Hanks, Paramount refused to increase the film's $55 million budget, and just the running scene alone would be very expensive to shoot.\n\nParamount / \u00a9Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nHanks and Zemeckis agreed to pay for the scenes in return for a larger percentage of the film's box office gross. He said that they both put in a lot of money, but it paid off! Reportedly, Hanks earned $65 million dollars from his percentage of the box office gross.\n\n16.Steve Jobs wanted to call the iMac MacMan. In fact, according to Ken Segall, who was the creative director at Apple\u2019s ad agency, TBWAChiatDay, and came up with the name iMac, Jobs really liked the name MacMan and was \"fixated\" on it. Jobs did approach the agency just to see if they had any better suggestions, saying, \"I have a name that I really like, we\u2019re going to go with it, but if you guys can do better we need you to do better within the next two weeks.\"\n\nUniversalimagesgroup / Getty Images\n\nSegall said that a week later, they met with Jobs and presented him with five names, saving iMac for last because he thought \"it was the killer name.\" However, Jobs hated the name iMac, too.\n\nMedianews Group / MediaNews Group via Getty Images\n\nA week later, Segall presented Jobs with three more names and also brought up that he still liked iMac as a name. Jobs hated the three new names, but said about iMac, \"I don\u2019t hate it this week, but I don\u2019t like it either, so now you\u2019ve got two days.\" Segall said that the next day, a friend at Apple called him to tell him Jobs had used iMac on one of the models and that it was getting good reactions. The rest was history.\n\nPatrick Durand / Sygma via Getty Images\n\n17.Somewhere between 2013 and 2015, you probably came across this popular \"You had one job!\" meme about Phil Tippett, the \"dinosaur supervisor\" credited in the end credits of Jurassic Park.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nWell, he actually was the \"dinosaur supervisor.\" Tippett was an Oscar-winning special effects producer who was brought on to work on Jurassic Park because he specialized in stop-motion animation. Originally, Steven Spielberg had thought all the up-close shots of the dinosaurs would be done by puppets and animatronics (which they did use), and all the full shots and running sequences would be done using models and stop-motion animation.\n\nHot Coco / Universal / Via youtube.com\n\nHowever, the team over at Industrial Light & Magic told Spielberg that CGI technology had gotten a lot better and they could create dinosaurs that could fool the eye. Once Spielberg saw the CGI dinosaurs, he knew that was the way to go.\n\nHot Coco / Universal / Via youtube.com\n\nWhen Spielberg told Tippett that he had decided to go with CGI, Tippett replied, \"I\u2019ve just become extinct!\" (a line that Steven would actually end up using in the movie). However, it was the exact opposite. Spielberg knew Tippett had a special skill set: He knew how animals behaved and moved. So instead of letting him go, Spielberg made Tippett the \"dinosaur supervisor,\" a role that had him overseeing the animation at ILM, to make sure the dinosaurs looked as real, and moved as realistically, as possible.\n\nUniversal Pictures / Via youtube.com\n\n18.Prior to its release in 1997, many critics and Hollywood insiders predicted that Titanic would be a box office bomb. And there were several reasons why it was predicted to be a failure. First off, at the time it was the most expensive movie ever made and was getting compared to the costly Waterworld \u2014 which had been released a couple of years before and had not managed to be a huge success because it, like Titanic, was the then\u2013most expensive movie ever made.\n\nEven though Waterworld grossed over $200 million at the box office, it was deemed a failure/moderate success 'cause it barely made a profit (again like Cleopatra). 20thcentfox / \u00a9 20thCentFox / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nSecond, aside from the cost of filming, Titanic also took a long time to film. Going way over schedule also delayed the release of the movie \u2014 as it was originally meant to be released during the summer (the blockbuster movie season). Moving its release date to December set off red flags.\n\n20thcentfox / \u00a9 20thCentFox / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nAnd last, many on-set stories about everything from the difficulty of working with Cameron to the PCP poisoning of the crew members had been reported throughout the film's production, which only added to the \"doomed film\" narrative.\n\n20thcentfox / \u00a9 20thCentFox / Courtesy Everett Collection\n\n19.And lastly: It wasn't just Netflix; there were various reasons why Blockbuster ended up going out of business. One reason was the popularity of DVDs. Until the introduction of DVDs, studios relied on the movie rental market as their primary way of making money from the home entertainment market \u2014 with Blockbuster accounting for nearly 50% of that revenue for them. To make it lucrative for both sides, the studios would give an exclusive window to video rental chains for new movie releases before they would put them on sale to the general public.\n\nDavid Friedman / Getty Images\n\nSo, if you wanted to watch a new movie at home, you more than likely would only be able to rent it. However, this changed when DVDs were released. In 1998, Warren Lieberfarb, then-head of Warner Bros.'s home video division and an early proponent of DVD technology, approached then-Blockbuster CEO John Antioco about creating the same exclusive rental window for DVDs. Well, Antioco turned down that offer. Lieberfarb, left with no choice, decided that DVDs should be released directly to customers. DVDs were also inexpensive to produce, so they could be sold cheaply.\n\nTim Boyle / Getty Images\n\nBy 2002, DVD players had become, at the time, the fastest-adopted consumer electronics device ever, with around 80 million players sold. Also, retailers like Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Costco, seeing the popularity of DVDs, expanded the footprints of the home entertainment department in their stores, becoming Blockbuster's biggest competitors. In fact, Walmart actually replaced Blockbuster as the studios' largest revenue source for the home entertainment market.\n\nTim Boyle / Getty Images\n\nWith the price of DVDs so low and stores carrying wide selections of both new and older movies, people began to buy movies a lot more \u2014 going from an average of about 5 VHS a year to buying around 15 DVDs a year\u2014 and renting less. If you were around at the time, you probably remember people building big movie collections. The studios benefited hugely from this, as they were making bigger profits from sales. As early as 2002, Blockbuster was seeing the effects of the shift in consumers, and it began to experience declining profits."

In 2024, modern methods like DNA analysis and remote sensing technology revealed new evidence of past cultures, technologies, and social structures. But while archaeology often now advances through science, it still needs fresh excavations to feed future studies.\n\nHere are some of the most important archaeological discoveries from the last 12 months.\n\n1. Lidar reveals hidden cities around the world\n\nLidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging, an analog of radar and sonar that scans terrain with thousands of pulses of laser light every second. While the technology has been around for decades, its ability to detect vast structures beneath layers of vegetation and to map the subtle changes of ancient landscapes has recently revolutionized archaeology."

Roivant is discontinuing the development of a drug for the lung disease sarcoidosis following negative results from a mid-stage clinical trial.\n\nMoving forward with AI and drug discovery\n\nThe hype bubble of AI-driven drug discovery is getting a little precarious. We recently saw Insilico Medicine fall short on statistically significant efficacy with its AI-designed drug, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals showed no reportable efficacy with its own AI-discovered therapy.\n\nAI\u2019s true potential, Caleb Appleton of Bison Ventures opines in a new First Opinion essay, is in complementing traditional drug discovery, particularly in environments where data are plentiful enough to help answer specific biological questions.\n\n\u201cImprovements in efficiency will be real, but they won\u2019t take the $3 billion it costs to develop a successful drug to $50 million anytime soon,\u201d he writes. \u201cHow the industry reacts in the coming months and years will dictate whether we enter an AI winter.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nRead more.\n\n5 companies using AI to design small molecule drugs\n\nIn a related piece, STAT\u2019s Brittany Trang this morning highlights five companies in the AI-driven drug discovery space for small molecules.\n\nStartups like Terray Therapeutics and Isomorphic Labs are at the forefront of the field, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars to find new medicines. Interestingly, companies like Schr\u00f6dinger and Iambic are distancing themselves just a touch from labels: \u201cWe don\u2019t think of ourselves as an AI company,\u201d said Fred Manby, chief technical officer at Iambic Therapeutics \u2014 saying instead the company integrates machine learning with automated lab data, synthetic training data generated with computational physics, and Iambic\u2019s platform that \u201cenables us to move so effectively in discovery.\u201d\n\nRead more.\n\nUpdating the obesity drug tracker. Plus, a new feature\n\nFrom STAT\u2019s Allison DeAngelis: The competition to build better obesity drugs has gotten more intense than ever.\n\nA new quarterly update of STAT\u2019s Obesity Drug Tracker shows there are now close to 50 obesity drugs in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, setting the stage for a news-filled 2025.\n\nLast week, Amgen \u2014 one of the pharma companies angling for a slice of weight loss drug sales \u2014 reported that its therapy MariTide led to an average of roughly 20% weight loss over a year. Boehringer Ingelheim has discontinued the development of an obesity drug targeting neuropeptide Y receptor type 2, while Arrowhead is moving its INHBE program into clinical trials. More startups clamored into the field this last quarter, including Kailera Therapeutics and Pep2Tango Therapeutics.\n\nAll told, the tracker is keeping tabs on roughly 150 drugs in development for weight loss and related conditions, about double the number of compounds than when STAT first published the tracker in fall 2023.\n\nTracking these updates is about to get even easier \u2014 you can register to get notified of updates to STAT\u2019s data tools and industry trackers, including the Obesity Drug Tracker, Generative AI Tracker, and CRISPR Tracker.\n\nGilead expanding in ADCs with Tubulis\n\nGilead Sciences is trying harder in the antibody drug conjugate space \u2014 partnering with Germany-based Tubulis in a deal worth $20 million up front to target solid tumors. Just last month, Gilead withdrew its antibody drug conjugate Trodelvy in bladder cancer, which had been approved in 2021, after a confirmatory trial failed. Trodelvy is still available for other indications, including some advanced breast cancers, and still remains a strong seller for the company.\n\nIn the deal, Gilead said Tubulis will design a topoisomerase I inhibitor-based ADC meant to have address challenges like durability and off-target toxicity issues.\n\nSanofi pours $1 billion into China for insulin plant\n\nSanofi just made its largest investment thus far in China, committing just over $1 billion to build a new insulin manufacturing facility in Beijing. This is Sanofi\u2019s fourth such site in China, which reflects the increasing demand for diabetes treatments for the 140 million adults there who have the disease. Sanofi\u2019s been in China for four decades now, and the company\u2019s plans are to integrate advanced automation, digital management, and sustainability practices into the plant.\n\nThis move comes amid challenges in China for Western pharma, FiercePharma points out, such as AstraZeneca\u2019s compliance woes and reported layoffs at Johnson & Johnson and Merck. Pfizer, meanwhile, has its own $1 billion planned investment in the country to accelerate drug development and support local biotechs.\n\nMore reads"

            "article_content": "2025 promises to be a pivotal moment in the evolution of software development, driven by the relentless advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). As AI continues to permeate every facet of our lives, its impact on the software development landscape is undeniable. From automating mundane tasks to revolutionizing the creative process, AI is poised to reshape the way we build and deploy software.\n\nDevPro Journal recently spoke with Bhavani Vangala, VP of Engineering at Onymos, who identified five key trends that will significantly influence software development in 2025. By understanding these trends, developers can harness the power of AI to streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and create more innovative and sophisticated applications.\n\nSkepticism Around Current AI Deployments Will Foster More Thoughtful and Scalable Future AI Development\n\nVangala says AI has become a crucial topic for executives and technology leaders over the past two years, especially following the surge of generative AI tools and models in late 2022 and early 2023. However, he adds that there is growing skepticism about whether some current AI deployments are truly production-ready solutions or just conceptual and document-level implementations driven by hype\u2014especially in the healthcare, finance, legal, and manufacturing industries. \u201cIn 2025, enterprises will increasingly evaluate their end-customer needs to accurately gauge AI\u2019s potential impact, assess the relevance of new AI trends for their businesses, and determine whether their development efforts will yield a return on investment,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis evaluation process will lead to more enterprises focusing their AI efforts on delivering tangible and scalable AI that will solve a particular need or challenge for their customers and businesses.\u201d\n\nThe Next Wave of Generative AI Model Training Will Focus on Improving Inference and Reasoning\n\n\u201cThe next wave of generative AI model training in 2025 is set to be transformative, focusing on enhancing reasoning and inference capabilities to make AI responses more intuitive and aligned with human thought processes,\u201d says Vangala. \u201cOpenAI\u2019s recent release of models like o1-preview models this shift, demonstrating significant improvements in inference and reasoning abilities. These advancements enable AI to process and respond to prompts with increased coherence and contextual awareness, marking a promising step forward.\u201d\n\nCurrent generative AI models often require detailed prompts and follow-up questions to provide accurate responses, especially for complex or nuanced inquiries, he adds. \u201cThis reliance on precise inputs can make interactions feel less fluid, as users must know how to phrase questions specifically to achieve accurate responses. Ongoing training efforts over the next year will aim to make AI\u2019s reasoning processes more natural and adaptable, enabling models to grasp context dynamically, consider implicit details, and apply logical steps similar to human thought patterns. This progression will allow models to not only answer questions but also infer intent and address nuanced needs effectively.\u201d\n\nGenerative AI Will Continue to Improve, Evolving Into Key Collaborative Partner\n\n\u201cWhile models like o1-preview represent substantial progress, the AI field is moving toward even greater strides in making models true collaborative partners,\u201d explains Vangala. \u201cThis involves continuous improvements to help models better emulate the way humans approach complex, layered decision-making. Such progress isn\u2019t just about faster responses\u2014it\u2019s about creating a depth of understanding that lets AI interact in a way that feels smooth, helpful, and highly attuned to user intent. However, human oversight remains vital, especially in sensitive fields like healthcare, finance, and law, where AI should support rather than replace decision-making.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, generative AI will continue to serve as an assistant, providing experts with fast, refined insights they can validate and adapt as needed. This evolution in model training positions AI as an increasingly trusted partner in decision-making and problem-solving, delivering insights with a depth and accuracy close to human judgment while respecting the complexity and nuances of each unique domain. By embracing AI as a collaborative tool rather than an autonomous replacement in the year \u2013 and years to come \u2013 industries can strike a productive balance, leveraging AI\u2019s strengths to enhance human expertise and drive meaningful, responsible advancements.\u201d\n\nAI Will Not Take Away the Roles of Software Developers or Architects\n\nVangala says that while some industries may still be exploring AI solutions at a conceptual level, it\u2019s clear that generative AI tools, especially large language models (LLMs), can improve productivity by summarizing vast amounts of data in minutes.\n\n\u201cThis capability allows professionals to draw insights and make informed decisions more rapidly,\u201d he adds. \u201cHowever, AI will not replace critical roles like software developers and architects in 2025 \u2013 or even in the years to come. Generative AI tools can indeed produce code that developers and enterprises may leverage to accelerate software development.\n\n\u201cWhile this efficiency can appeal to enterprises looking to cut costs and speed up project timelines, AI-generated code requires careful review. The code these tools produce comes from existing text and data shared online, which are contributed for specific purposes or products. Therefore, it cannot be directly integrated by simple copying and pasting.\n\n\u201cSoftware developers and architects must thoroughly review, test, and adapt this code to fit specific software requirements and ensure it\u2019s robust and maintainable over the long term. This means that software developers and architects remain essential to the software lifecycle. They bring the expertise necessary to adapt code to unique applications and to handle the ongoing evolution of software, making their roles crucial for successful development and deployment. As a result, AI is a tool that aids productivity but does not replace the need for experienced professionals in the development field. This blend of AI-driven efficiency and human oversight is particularly relevant across healthcare, finance, legal, retail, and manufacturing industries, where AI serves as an enabler rather than a replacement.\u201d\n\nSmall Language Models Will Gain Popularity for Specific Domains\n\n\u201cIn 2025, growing concerns about cost, infrastructure, and privacy will fuel the development and utilization of small language models [SLMs] across multiple sectors, such as healthcare, law, government, and finance, explains Vangala. \u201cWhile large language models can be beneficial in certain situations, they often necessitate specialized infrastructure and cost, making them less accessible to many companies, especially startups.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, significant privacy and security concerns exist around the data used in training LLMs. This concern is particularly high in healthcare, where safeguarding user (or patient) information is crucial, and model customization is preferred. Just think about it this way: would you be comfortable integrating an LLM based on accurate and misleading data from the web in a tool that assesses cancer risk? By utilizing SLMs, organizations in high-stakes sectors can develop tailored models based on domain-specific and accurate data while ensuring privacy, security, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency.\u201d"

In 2025, regarding quality and security as inseparable components of success will become the standard. This shift is fueled by heightened scrutiny from senior executives who recognize that flaws in either area can directly impact a company\u2019s reputation, revenue, and long-term growth. The days of siloed teams are fading. Instead, QA, development, cybersecurity, and product teams will work in tandem\u2014assuring fluid, cross-department engagement and collaboration, with all teams sharing roles and responsibilities to ensure holistic software integrity.\n\nA key driver of this trend is the push to make tools and processes more integrated. Whether it\u2019s enabling cross-team collaboration or ensuring seamless data sharing, businesses are beginning to recognize that fragmented systems slow innovation. High-quality, centralized solutions should become a core value to all companies who want to succeed in 2025. Resources to support this change should be understood as powerful investments that will aggregate value to the entire company, not only to the operational level. Companies that embrace integrated tools and cross-functional workflows will unlock faster time-to-market, elevate customer trust, and cement themselves as a strong competitor in the market."
