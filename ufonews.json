        "article_content": "Game Theory: UFO 50 is a massive trove of twists on old-school gaming genius Scroll until you find a title that sounds cool; you may hit something that'll be one of your favorite games of 2024.\n\nWhen approaching a video game project like Mossmouth\u2019s new release UFO 50\u2014an absolutely massive labor of love that is brilliant, frustrating, fun, mysterious, artistically ambitious, and sometimes just really fucking frustrating\u2014it helps to start from base principles. So: UFO 50, released on Steam this week, is a collection of 50 games of varying length and complexity, all purportedly from a fictional 1980s video game developer called UFOSoft. The games in the collection, which are presented in a fake chronological order built around the loosely sketched history of the company, largely draw their inspirations from the library of the Nintendo Entertainment System; amidst more esoteric or complicated pastiches, you can find games that serve as fairly straight homages to River City Rampage, Uninvited, Solar Jetman, Dragon Quest, and many more. There are meta elements operating to the side of the main draw\u2014notes on the games\u2019 fake development, a terminal that lets you go digging for secrets, markers that indicate when you\u2019ve completed individual titles\u2014but the focus has clearly been put on the games themselves, which were developed (in our world) by the Mossmouth team, including Spelunky creator Derek Yu.\n\nThe obvious comparison point for all this, at least for nerds of a certain vintage, will be clear: Cult Nintendo DS title Retro Game Challenge (and its sadly never-exported-from-Japan sequel), which pulled this same basic \u201cfake games from fake consoles from a fake past\u201d conceit back in 2007. Players who come to UFO 50 looking for a direct recreation of that experience might come away a little disappointed, though: Where that game prided itself on building up the fiction surrounding its faux games, complete with fake manuals and fake magazines for players to peruse in between playing its riffs on Mario or Galaga, UFO 50 is a bit more barebones in its presentation. (You get a few sentences of notes per game, and that\u2019s about it.) Given a choice between putting their emphasis on the games, or on the materials surrounding them, the small Mossmouth team understandably focused on function over form; we might wish for a more lush package, but it honestly feels churlish to complain, when the actual content of the collection is far more expansive than we\u2019ve had time to even come close to coming to terms with.\n\nAs to that content: We wish we could declare each of UFO 50\u2032s 50 games a retro-indie masterpiece, each one preserving what worked from classic game design while jettisoning the chaff, but, uh\u2026 No. Don\u2019t get us wrong: There are extremely good games in here, some more than worth the collection\u2019s $25 asking price all on their own. (We have lost too many hours this past week already to arena shooter Overbold, or mechanically gorgeous dungeon crawler Valbrace.) But many of the games in the collection feel torn between their desire to stay true to the clunky, frequently unfair controls of console ages past, and being genuinely fun games. Yes, it feels authentic that Barbuta, the very first game in the collection, happily wipes your progress every time you lose all your lives, erasing what could be 20 minutes of very fussy trap and dungeon navigation. Whether it\u2019s fun is a much thornier question.\n\nBut while we can\u2019t champion UFO 50 as 50 instant masterpieces, we also can\u2019t paint it with the broad brush of being uniformly old-school ornery for its old sake\u2014or a nostalgia exercise with no appeal for players who didn\u2019t grow up pulling battered NES carts off the rental wall of their local video store. The truth is that this really is 50 different games, each with their own control schemes and design hooks, and the quality is inevitably going to vary. Part of the fun of the package, in fact, is in that kind of discovery: For every game you play five minutes of before concluding \u201cEh, not for me,\u201d you\u2019re just as likely to run into something like the boldly strange Mooncat, or \u201cWhat if we\u2019d invented tower defense games on the NES\u201d hypothetical Rock On! Island. At the bare minimum, each title has something genuinely clever powering it, whether it\u2019s Mortol\u2018s attempt to build an action game out of Lemmings DNA, or Avianos\u2018 bird-based war gaming. Half the time, when we caught ourselves thinking \u201cOkay, we get it, let\u2019s move on\u201d after poking around at a game, we turned out to be basically right; the other half, though, we inevitably stumbled into some new secret or twist of play that deepened the experience of an individual title.\n\nUFO 50 is, in other words, a game that trusts you, the player, to find the fun\u2014with the promise that there is a lot of fun to be found in this odd, massive toy chest. We should note that the game does have a few curation tools\u2014if you scroll down to the bottom of the collection, you can filter games by whether they\u2019re meant to be more reflex based, or cerebral, for instance, or focus in on the title\u2019s large number of same-screen multiplayer games. (Breaking free of the chronology is a good idea in any case; although UFO 50 doesn\u2019t pay as much attention to the \u201ccomplexity increases as fictional time passes\u201d conceit that powered Retro Game Challenge, you\u2019ll still tend to find more robust experiences closer to the end of UFOSoft\u2019s fictional lifespan.) We\u2019re sure we\u2019ll soon see a cottage industry of guides and wider critiques pointing out hidden gems buried in its library. But honestly, we recommend just doing what the game itself advises: Scroll through until you find a title that sounds cool, blow off the fictional dust, and take a gamble on the chance you\u2019ll hit something that\u2019ll be one of your favorite games of 2024."

The most recent Pentagon report seems to conclude that most of the sightings people have witnessed haven't necessarily been related to extraterrestrials. Instead, these \"craft\" were likely connected to secret projects by groups and governments right here on Earth. The phone call is coming from inside the house.\n\nNo matter what you believe about the nature of \"flying saucers,\" there is one sighting labeled the \"most convincing\" UFO encounter in history. According to CBC, the Falcon Lake incident in Canada is being called the \"best-documented UFO case\" 50 years after the actual event.\n\nThe story has been covered in books and shows, including Unsolved Mysteries at one point, but it originates from May 1967 in the Falcon Lake woods in Manitoba, Canada. \"I recalled seeing him in bed. He didn't look good at all. He looked pale, haggard,\" Stan Michalak said about his father. \"When I walked into the bedroom there was a huge stink in the room, like a real horrible aroma of sulphur and burnt motor. It was all around and it was coming out of his pores. It was bad.\"\n\nMichalak was only a nine-year-old at the time but has detailed the incident as co-author of When They Appear, a book written with UFO researcher Chris Rutkowski. The book came out in 2017, but recently resurfaced due to coverage online at outlets like Daily Star.\n\nAccording to the account, Stefan Michalak was in the woods when he encountered a pair of \"cigar-shaped objects\" nearby, changing hues while floating before taking a disc shape. Michalak started drawing what he saw, which made their way online years later, before trying to get closer to the object.\n\n\"He couldn't make out any words, or anything, but he heard at least two beings communicating inside. He called out, offering mechanical help if they needed it,\" the It Gets Weird podcast recently detailed. \"As soon as he touches the craft, the fingertips just start to melt, so it's so hot that it literally melts the gloves he's wearing...He's hit by this blast of air, that pushes him backward and sets his shirt and hat on fire. He's stumbling backward, getting pushed by this wave of air and gas, and trying to take this burning shirt and hat off.\"\n\nThe account goes on to say he showed symptoms of radiation sickness and had \"severe burns\" on his torso that look like a grate or Bingo card. Once released from the hospital, he returned to the locale to recover his \"charred shirt, a melted glove and tools he'd left behind.\" He maintained his story until dying in 1999, never saying he encountered little green men either."

        "article_content": "Prakash Sangam\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThis story was updated to correct a byline.\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: Due to a production error, an earlier version of this story inadvertently included the wrong byline. It has been corrected.\n\nIf you are looking to buy a new laptop for this school year or as a gift during the holiday season, you will be faced with a major decision: Should you buy a next-generation AI-powered Copilot+ PC? However, the recent flurry of announcements by laptop OEMs and chip providers that power them has made that decision almost a misnomer.\n\nWhat is a Copilot+ PC, and why do you need it?\n\nCopilot+ PCs are a new breed of laptops with significant on-device (Generative) Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities. To get this moniker from Windows provider Microsoft, laptops must meet or exceed specific minimum AI processing requirements. For the technically inclined, the requirement is to have a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) with at least 40 TOPS (Trillion Operations Per Second) processing power. Copilot+ PCs offer a full day or more battery life, lightning-fast performance, enhanced user experience and are very thin, light and sleek.\n\nCurrently, most of the AI processing happens in the cloud, which means all your information, be it your interaction with ChatGPT or text-to-image creation with many tools, is sent to the cloud. However, with Copilot+ PCs, most of that processing happens on the device. That means your data remains private and securely stored in the device. Additionally, on-device AI is more accurate, personalized, relevant and almost free. If you want more details on this, please check my articles here and here.\n\nEven if you are not looking to use AI, you have to buy Copilot+ PCs, as they are the best of the breed, most secure and best-looking laptops in the market today, outperforming anything else, even Apple\u2019s MacBook.\n\nAll Copilot+ PCs are not created equal\n\nCopilot+ PCs have a lot of variances in terms of the chip platforms, various configurations of those platforms, many OEMs, price and performance tiers and more. It all started when the smartphone technology giant Qualcomm joined Microsoft and scores of PC OEMs to introduce the first Copilot+ PCs based on its Snapdragon XElite and XPlus platforms in May of this year. They set a new bar for laptop performance.\n\nFollowing Qualcomm, the personal computing giant Intel and AMD introduced their Copilot+ PC platforms. Intel\u2019s platform is called Core Ultra 200V (project name Lunar Lake), and AMD\u2019s is called Ryzen AI300. Many OEMs announced laptops with these platforms at the recently concluded European consumer show IFA.\n\nThere are some key differences between Qualcomm and Intel/AMD platforms. Qualcomm platforms are designed using the technology from Arm, a British company. This technology has been used in smartphones for over twenty years and is known for its exceptional power efficiency. Qualcomm introduced this for PC platforms to achieve path-breaking battery life and thin, light and sleek designs, and it set the target for other vendors. Because it is new, the Arm for Windows app ecosystem is still developing. Almost all essential apps are supported, but some apps, especially some games, may not yet be supported.\n\nIntel and AMD platforms are based on X86 technology, which has been around for over 30 years, so app compatibility is not the issue. However, the Core Ultra 200V and Ryzen AI300 are new designs, and their performance is not yet proven.\n\nSo, when choosing Copilot+ PCs, along with price points, features and others, users must also be aware of the platforms used on those PCs. For reference, here is my review of Lenovo\u2019s Yoga Slim 7x.\n\nUSA TODAY Home Internet:See the best and most reliable broadband plans in your area\n\nWhy is it a good time to buy them now?\n\nTechnology is akin to waves in the ocean \u2014 by the time one reaches shore, another one is ready just behind it. If you want to get the maximum benefits of the latest technology, you must jump in when it is reasonably mature, with ample choices in the market. Copilot+ PCs are exactly at that stage now.\n\nAlmost all PC OEMs now offer Copilot+ PCs, including Lenovo, Dell, HP, Samsung, Microsoft, Asus, Acer and many others. They are available for both consumer and enterprise segments at all price points. For example, PC market leader Lenovo has ThinkPad for enterprises, Yoga for premium consumers, IdeaPad for mid/value-tier and more. Each segment has different variations to suit every consumer and business need. Other PC OEMs have similar offerings as well. At IFA, Qualcomm even introduced a new platform targeting laptops in the $700 range.\n\nMicrosoft offers many Copilot+ AI features and applications for better video calls, live captioning in many languages, text-to-image creation and more. AI is still in its infancy; as we progress, there will be a continuous flow of innovative and user experience-enhancing AI apps and features.\n\nOne key common factor among all Copilot+ PC platforms is that they have the same AI capability across tiers. For example, Qualcomm\u2019s XElite and XPlus have the same AI processor. This means no matter which Copilot+ PC you choose, you get excellent performance for years to come. In summary, if you are in the market for a laptop this year, go ahead and consider a Copilot+ PC."

        "article_content": "When you think about artificial intelligence (AI), things such as self-driving cars and humanoid robots might come to mind. Counterintuitively, it's often a good idea to think about how products are actually brought to life whenever a new big trend emerges. Some of the most lucrative opportunities are also often the least obvious ones.\n\nFor AI to even work properly, companies have to invest large sums of capital expenditures (capex) into data centers. Although data centers might seem like just a piece of real estate, they are far more sophisticated and important. They house critical IT infrastructure, such as chipsets known as graphics processing units (GPUs) -- an important component of generative AI applications.\n\nToday, Nvidia is one of the biggest names in the data center realm. But what if I told you I see another opportunity as the superior choice among data center investments and that it's not even a technology company?\n\nIt's important to consider all options -- even the most tangential ones. Let's dig into a nuclear energy stock that I think may end up being the most important data center company in the long run and explore why this could be a lucrative opportunity for investors.\n\nNuclear-powered data centers are on the rise, and...\n\nA major selling point of AI is that the technology can bring a new wave of efficiency to a host of use cases. From breakthroughs in enterprise software to self-driving cars, AI is promising a new level of productivity and safety that's never been witnessed.\n\nAlthough that sounds great, as with all things, AI comes with some major trade-offs. Namely, building AI applications is a pricey ambition. GPU hardware and high-performance computing software are some of the more obvious expenses in AI development. One of the more subtle costs in an AI roadmap resides with data centers, particularly their energy consumption.\n\nGPUs are constantly running complex algorithms and performing sophisticated computing tasks. This makes IT architecture, such as server racks, consume a lot of energy and, in particular, give off a lot of heat. Data centers are equipped with a number of temperature control protocols, such as air conditioning units, fans, and generators.\n\nHowever, these solutions are both costly and can be inefficient compared to other sources of energy control. An emerging trend at the crossroads of data centers and energy consumption is nuclear power, and some really notable companies and business leaders are getting involved.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\n...a lot of big names are involved\n\nOne notable company involved with nuclear-powered data centers is Amazon. One of the biggest businesses in Amazon's ecosystem is its cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Earlier this year, AWS acquired a nuclear-powered data center from Talen Energy for a reported $650 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother player emerging on the nuclear power scene is Oklo. Oklo develops nuclear fission reactors that it aims to sell to data centers and utility companies.\n\nWhen it was still a private company, Oklo raised funding from Peter Thiel and OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman. A few months ago, Oklo went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).\n\nAccording to its investor presentation, the company has received interest for its reactors from major companies, including Diamondback Energy, Equinix, Siemens Energy, and even the U.S. Air Force.\n\nWhile this caliber of attention and Altman's support are impressive, I see Oklo as a risky bet at the moment. The company is still pre-revenue, and the potential deals referenced above are in early-stage negotiations.\n\nOklo will likely require hefty ongoing research and development (R&D) costs to build out its reactors, which will take a toll on the company's liquidity so long as there aren't material sales coming through the door.\n\nMy top pick at the intersection of nuclear energy and data centers is...\n\nMy top choice among nuclear power suppliers for data centers is Constellation Energy (NASDAQ: CEG). The company offers a host of energy services but is making sustainability and nuclear energy a specific focus.\n\nOne of the company's known nuclear power customers is \"Magnificent Seven\" member Microsoft. During the company's second-quarter earnings call in late August, CEO Joseph Dominguez referenced Comcast and Johns Hopkins as other notable customers of Constellation's carbon-free energy services.\n\nOther mega-cap tech companies will likely follow Amazon and Microsoft's moves. Constellation's diverse customer base signals that green energy is not just a use case for data centers or big tech hyperscalers.\n\nInvestors with a long-term horizon may want to consider a position in Constellation Energy right now.

        "article_content": "New York Post may be compensated and/or receive an affiliate commission if you buy through our links.\n\nHow well do you really know someone?\n\nThink about your mother, best friend, or perhaps a colleague. It\u2019s hard to know everything, but sometimes all it takes is asking a few questions, and a new form of artificial intelligence wants to make it easier than ever to understand people and their stories.\n\nAutobiographer is among the first offerings in the app store that leverages AI to transcribe people\u2019s memories into epic stories \u2014 like chapters in memoirs \u2014 that can be passed down for generations.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a story to tell,\u201d said Autobiographer CEO Matt Bowman in a May press release. \u201cWe created Autobiographer to help people discover, preserve, and share their unique life experiences. Our app is like having a personal biographer in your pocket, ready to listen and capture your most meaningful moments.\u201d\n\nRELATED: The 7 best books we read in August 2024, ranked and reviewed\n\nWhile artificial intelligence is the foundation of this transcription app, Autobiographer has not lost its human-first approach. The brand has partnered with award-winning journalist and redeemed author Katie Couric to help people share their stories.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always believed in the power of storytelling to connect us and inspire us,\u201d explained Couric. \u201cAutobiographer is doing something remarkable by making it easy for anyone to capture their life story.\u201d\n\nThe app is available in the United States and can be purchased in the app store or gifted to a loved one.\n\nWondering how Autobiographer works? The process is simple.\n\nUpon downloading the app, users are asked for their basic information and led to a dusky background with a floating iceberg-like-rock and an arrow with text reading, \u201cmemories ready to be explored.\u201d\n\nRecording starts as soon as you press start. A gentle voice called the \u2018Guide\u2019 begins asking leading questions. The initial queries begin with some open-ended prompts along the lines of \u201cGive me a broad overview of your life,\u201d and then more specific probes like \u201cHow did you feel when that happened?\u201d and \u201cWhat did you learn from that moment?\u201d\n\nAfter each conversation with your Guide, Autobiographer crafts a written story that can be accessed via the app\u2019s \u201cVault.\u201d Users can refine and customize these memories as they wish \u2014 with the goal in mind of building a complete memoir they can leave behind. The more questions answered, the longer the story gets, with the potential of reaching up to 50,000 words.\n\nStories are easily accessible, but privacy is also paramount. Encryption and FaceID biometric protection are employed to ensure all sensitive, personal information stays secure. The brand does not store any data beyond individual sessions.\n\nIt might sound a bit mystifying, or perhaps futuristic \u2014 but it\u2019s very real and available for just $16.50 a month or $199 a year.\n\nAutobiographer\n\nIs Autobiographer worth it? We decided to put the AI stoytelling app to the test.\n\nIt was a quiet Wednesday afternoon in the office, and I downloaded and set up Autobiographer in just a few minutes. Then, I handed my phone to my colleague, P.J. McCormick to put it to the test.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take him too long to get used to the interface. It\u2019s rather intuitive (after all, it\u2019s built so a grandparent could easily navigate it).\n\nMccormick\u2019s first task was simple \u2014 catch the guide up to speed on his life. He spoke fondly about his childhood in a suburban town near St. Paul Minnesota, and then transformative relocations to cosmopolitan cities like London and New York. He mentioned his love for music and intrigue with fast-moving city life.\n\nAutobiographer took note. Questions began getting more personal, pinpointing the motivations behind his choices \u2014 like how strict his parents were as a kid, why he chose to attend a small liberal arts school, and what factors influenced him to join an Indie Rock band.\n\n\u201cWow, this is pretty good,\u201d he said with a chuckle between questions. The hushed voice spent around 30 seconds generating new questions after McCormick answered, leaving him with just enough time to mull over his responses.\n\nMcCormick spoke on, and within fifteen minutes, two chapters of his life had already been written, the first aptly titled, \u201cAn unconventional Indie Rocker\u2019s Journey.\u201d He was exceptionally impressed with Autobiographer\u2019s ability to eloquently, and succinctly put his life into words.\n\n\u201cI found the questions surprisingly considerate and thoughtful and (the voice) did seem like it was responding in real time to my prompts as opposed to providing pre-determined questions,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe voice was probing \u2014 yet respectful when we pushed the boundaries.\u201d\n\nMcCormick admitted that if he spent even more time answering, he could imagine getting somewhat emotional, \u201cIf I spent more time with it and it went beyond the basics, I can see how the app would lead to more introspection.\u201d\n\nHe thoroughly enjoyed the experience, though he\u2019d hardly even made a dent in the Vault, which can record hours of conversations. It may seem like a lot of time, but it\u2019s \u201cpretty fun,\u201d as he admits, and it\u2019s a great way to understand someone, and even yourself, a bit better.\n\nAfter all, the founders\u2019 guiding belief is that \u201cthe world\u2019s best stories are within us\u2014they just haven\u2019t been discovered yet.\u201d\n\nHunting for a headline-worthy haul?

        "article_content": "Found footage movies have become synonymous with horror, and for good reason. I\u2019ve always felt that the raw, unpolished style of these movies makes them feel more visceral, as if they\u2019re happening in real-time. Of course, the shaky camera work and amateur-looking footage might not be for everyone, but there\u2019s something chilling about watching this kind of movie, and what better time to experience one with Halloween around the corner.\n\nFor those who want to experience this incredibly tense subgenre, I've rounded up five of the best found footage movies currently available to stream on some of the best services. So, grab your late-night snacks and get ready to watch true terror on the small screen. Note: you might not be able to sleep after watching some of these, because I certainly couldn't.\n\n'Host' (2020)\n\nHost - Official Trailer [HD] | A Shudder Original - YouTube Watch On\n\nScreen-capture-style movies where most of the story takes place through the computer\u2019s webcam have usually always flopped. Take the likes of \"Unfriended\" and \"Friend Request\" for example, which are entertaining enough to watch, but the execution and character development aren't great. One movie in this subgenre that does exceed is \"Host\", a tense horror set (and made) during the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\n\"Host\" follows a group of six friends who decide to conduct a virtual s\u00e9ance over Zoom. Seeking a unique way to pass the time, they hire a medium to guide them through the session. However, things quickly take a dark turn when one of the friends disrespects the process by pretending to make contact with a fake spirit. This action opens the door for an actual malevolent entity to invade their call.\n\nOf course, as you can probably guess, the supernatural force begins to haunt each participant, manifesting terrifying events in their own homes. The entire movie plays out through the Zoom call, making you feel like you are part of the group\u2019s increasingly desperate struggle to survive the night.\n\nWatch on Shudder\n\n'Cloverfield' (2008)\n\nCloverfield (2008) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers - YouTube Watch On\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be right if I didn\u2019t include \"Cloverfield\" on this list considering it was one of the very first found footage movies I ever saw.

The movie begins at a going-away party, where Rob (Michael Stahl-David), the main character, is preparing to move to Japan. His friends are documenting the event on a handheld camera when suddenly, a massive explosion rocks the city.\n\nThe group quickly realizes they are in the middle of a large-scale disaster as a gigantic creature wreaks havoc, destroying buildings and causing widespread panic. The great thing about this is that it\u2019s presented entirely through the footage captured on a handheld camera, meaning you're up close and personal with the action.\n\nWatch on Paramount Plus\n\n'Rec' (2007)\n\n[Rec] (2007) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers - YouTube Watch On\n\nA movie that uses handheld camera work and real-time events to create a claustrophobic, immersive experience will always be highly regarded in my books. And one such movie includes \"Rec,\" which isn\u2019t for the faint-hearted (honestly, this one really scared me).\n\nThis Spanish found footage horror follows a television reporter, \u00c1ngela Vidal (Manuela Velasco), and her cameraman, Pablo (Pablo Rosso), as they document the night shift at a local fire station. When they are called to a routine emergency at an apartment building, they find themselves trapped inside with a group of residents.\n\nHowever, it becomes clear that something sinister is going on. The residents start exhibiting strange and violent behavior, and the situation quickly escalates into a full-blown nightmare. The building is soon sealed off by the authorities, and \u00c1ngela and Pablo are forced to confront the horrifying truth: A mysterious infection has spread through the building, turning people into rabid, zombie-like creatures.\n\nWatch on Tubi\n\n'Creep' (2014)\n\nCreep Official Trailer 1 (2015) - Mark Duplass Horror Movie HD - YouTube Watch On\n\nFor anyone who enjoys slow-burn tension that leads to a disturbing and shocking climax, then \"Creep\" should be your next weekend watch. It's notable for its minimalistic approach since it mainly focuses on just two characters and how they interact.\n\n\"Creep\" follows a freelance cameraman named Aaron (Patrick Brice) who responds to a Craigslist ad for a one-day film job. The ad was placed by Josef (Mark Duplass), a man who claims he has a terminal illness and wants to make a video diary for his unborn child.\n\nAs Aaron films Josef, he quickly becomes unsettled by Josef's increasingly strange and unsettling behavior. Josef's requests grow more bizarre and invasive, and Aaron begins to suspect that something is seriously wrong. The moment when Josef's true nature and intentions are revealed definitely makes this movie worth watching.\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n'Paranormal Activity' (2007)\n\nPerhaps one of the most well-known (yet somehow most underrated) found footage movies is \"Paranormal Activity.\" I made the mistake of watching it when I was younger, and it haunted me for days. That didn\u2019t stop me from appreciating it and \"Paranormal Activity\" definitely ranks as one of the best found footage movies ever.\n\nIt revolves around a young couple, Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat), who have recently moved into a new home. Katie believes that she is being haunted by a supernatural entity, and the couple decides to document the eerie occurrences using a video camera.\n\nAs the days go by, the disturbances grow stranger. The couple sets up the camera to record while they sleep, hoping to capture evidence of the haunting. What they discover in the footage reveals increasingly sinister and supernatural activities occurring in their home, including strange noises, objects moving on their own and disturbing events that escalate over time.\n\nWatch on Max"

And I just thought, why have you said that?\n\n\u2018I wanted to say to him, \u201cWell, hang on a minute. That\u2019s my religion. I\u2019m a spiritualist, if you were Jewish, Muslim, Catholic whatever, I\u2019m not going to ridicule your faith, why on earth are you ridiculing mine?\u201d\u2018\n\nThe Most Haunted star has revealed some terrifying experiences she\u2019s witnessed (Picture: Mike Lawn/Shutterstock)\n\nOver the years, Yvette has shared some of the experiences she\u2019s had including when she was almost killed by a horse after using a Ouija board, having members of her crew attacked by ghosts, and when she was once chased by a \u2018pair of legs\u2019 in a haunted theatre.\n\nBut the chilling ghostly experiences she witnessed in preparation for her latest book may be the worst yet.\n\nDuring a visit to Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland, Yvette and the film crew visited a Bones Room, full of human remains that have been excavated from the landmark\u2019s grounds after numerous historical battles.\n\n\u2018We were there, the film crew and myself, and all of a sudden we heard something hit the floor and put a torch on and we found a bone,\u2019 she recalled.\n\n\u2018We were like, oh my god, and it happened again and again. And then the worst bit was when the historian felt something land in his hair, and we looked and it was a human tooth\u2026 we all gave it legs and ran.\u2019\n\nYvette detailed the ghostly encounters in preparation for her new book (Picture: Ken McKay/ITV/Shutterstock)\n\nElsewhere during research for her latest venture, she was left locked in a turret at the top of Oxford Castle when the \u2018door slammed\u2019 \u2013 and the situation still remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nShe explained: \u2018We were all inside this particular room at the top of the turret, and to lock the door from the outside was a huge metal bolt that you had to slide across.\n\n\u2018We would have heard it slide, but the door slammed, made us all jump, and then we didn\u2019t hear anything. When we tried to get out, we couldn\u2019t get out, so we had to use our phones to get somebody to come and help us\u2026 There was nobody humanly possible that could have done it.\u2019\n\nThose eerie moments never made Yvette want to stop her research though, as her love of castles kept her going.\n\n\u2018Yes, there\u2019s frightening moments and moments where you actually run or leave a location,\u2019 she said.\n\nDuring the team\u2019s visit to Pengersick Castle in Cornwall, two of her crew were so frightened that they sprinted to the car and locked themselves in, Yvette told us.\n\nBut the horror didn\u2019t stop there. She said: \u2018They could hear footsteps on the ground path leading towards the car and something walking around the car. That was frightening.\u2019\n\n\u2018But no, it\u2019s like a roller coaster ride,\u2019 Yvette added, insisting that the next day she\u2019s ready to go back and do it all over again.\n\nAnd she hasn\u2019t just been haunted by paranormal forces while filming.\n\nIn fact, strange occurrences happened in her own home when she first moved in, despite asking the previous owners if the house was haunted, \u2018because it looked like it should be\u2019.\n\nYvette witnessed paranormal experiences in her own home (Picture: Paul Cooper/Shutterstock)\n\n\u2018Within the first few weeks of us moving in, all sorts of weird stuff was happening,\u2019 she told us.\n\nYvette continued: \u2018My children would be at school and I would hear in the house \u201cMummy\u201d, somebody would be knocking on the door, [and I\u2019d go to the door], this would happen about five times in a day, and there\u2019s nobody there.\u2019\n\nShe also revealed that kitchen chairs would \u2018move on their own and be placed in a pyramid shape, balanced on top of each other on the kitchen table\u2019.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough to make anyone want to move house, Yvette also said her husband Karl saw a ghost dressed like a Cavalier outside their house, only for them to later discover that soldiers had been murdered near their home during the Civil War.\n\nShe went on: \u2018After a while we got used to it, and the weird thing is now that both my children are all grown up and living their own lives, got their own homes and everything, there\u2019s nothing, there\u2019s no activity.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a firm believer that energy, and especially young energy, can actually exacerbate or really meddle with the atmosphere and the vibrations within a house.\u2019\n\nYvette\u2019s new book, Most Haunted Castles, is available to buy from September 19\n\nDespite how terrifying those encounters have been, Yvette added that she would never wish she was \u2018oblivious\u2019 to the experiences.\n\n\u2018God no, it\u2019s changed my whole life,\u2019 she said. \u2018Before I did Most Haunted I\u2019d had a couple of experiences and I started to become interested\u2026 but before that I actually thought there was nothing when we died, I didn\u2019t believe in anything. I didn\u2019t believe in god, didn\u2019t have a faith, nothing.\n\n\u2018And it actually affected me, made me a bit down, because I just thought, oh my god, what are we here for? What\u2019s this about? Which we\u2019ve all asked, especially when you\u2019re younger, you\u2019re questioning everything.\n\n\u2018So then of course, we made Most Haunted\u2026 and after all the things that I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019ve heard, that we do go on and we see our loved ones again, and we go to another place, that for me has completely changed my whole outlook on life and I feel I\u2019m a happier person for it.\n\n\u2018For me, that\u2019s my faith and I\u2019m so very pleased and proud that me and my husband found it.\u2019\n\nMost Haunted Castles written by Yvette Fielding, illustrated by Hannah Shaw, will be released on September 19 and available in all good bookshops.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page \u2013 we\u2019d love to hear from you."

        "article_content": "Scientists have uncovered an underwater event that wiped out nearly all life in a groundbreaking discovery.\n\nThe new study has shed light on what happened to lead to a whopping 90 percent of life being totally wiped out from the Earth.\n\nIt\u2019s said this catastrophe happened roughly 250 million years ago and it\u2019s even suggested to be more fatal than the asteroid that famously saw the end of the dinosaurs on this planet.\n\nAdvert\n\nPublished in the journal Science, the UK's University of Bristol and China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) researchers are claiming that El Ni\u00f1os were responsible for causing the climate to vary wildly and forests to be killed off.\n\nScientists reckon the underwater event had an impact (Getty Stock Image)\n\nYou might have heard of El Ni\u00f1os before (and I\u2019m not talking about football) as it\u2019s the weather phenomena that cause sea surfaces to warm up drastically.\n\nIt typically takes place in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. An El Ni\u00f1o is declared when sea temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific rise 0.5 \u00b0C above the long-term average.\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd while volcanic activity definitely played a big role in the \u2018Great Dying\u2019 (the worst mass extinction in Earth\u2019s history, also known as the Permian-Triassic extinction), experts say the impact of these El Ni\u00f1os shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nChina University of Geosciences\u2019 Professor Yadong Sun claims that oxygen isotopes in fossils suggest they could have been greatly involved in this mass loss of life.\n\nHe said: \u201cMost life failed to adapt to these conditions, but thankfully a few things survived, without which we wouldn\u2019t be here today. It was nearly, but not quite, the end of life on Earth.\u201d\n\nGlobal warming had an impact (Getty Stock Image)\n\nAdvert\n\nAnd co-lead author of this study, Dr Alexander Farnsworth, from the University of Bristol, added: \u201cClimate warming alone cannot drive such devastating extinctions because, as we are seeing today, when the tropics become too hot, species migrate to the cooler, higher latitudes.\n\n\u201cOur research has revealed that increased greenhouse gases don\u2019t just make the majority of the planet warmer, they also increase weather and climate variability making it even more 'wild' and difficult for life to survive.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the exact cause of the Great Dying remains somewhat uncertain but it\u2019s pretty complicated.\n\nAs well as so much time having obviously passed since, there\u2019s a scarcity of fossils to study and a complexity of evidence. Either way, scientists know something big happened to have such a big consequence."

        "article_content": "Apple\u2019s smartphones are finally entering a new era \u2014 a phase where the software is driving as much innovation as the hardware. In fact, if one looks at the magnitude of changes that iOS 18 brings to the table with Apple Intelligence at the helm, the hardware enhancements pale in comparison. The Apple iPhone 16 Pro is at the forefront of that movement, thanks largely to the inclusion of Apple\u2019s new AI, which is likely to become a core part of everyone\u2019s iOS experience when it launches. But is there any merit in holding on to an older iPhone?\n\nThe iPhone 14 Pro is the focus for most buyers\u2019 \u201ckeep or jump\u201d dilemma. A remnant of the Lightning port era, the iPhone 14 Pro continues to prove its mettle as a reliable warhorse with a terrific camera. But the kind of comprehensive changes across screen, silicon, charging, and software perameters introduced by the iPhone 16 Pro also make it a candidate for an upgrade.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nIf you\u2019ve been holding on tight to your iPhone 14 and aren\u2019t sure if there are any meaningful advancements to warrant a spending spree, here\u2019s a detailed breakdown to guide your upgrade decision.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: specs\n\nSpecs iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 14 Pro Size 149.6 x 71.5 x 8.25 mm (5.89 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches) 147.5 x 71.5 x 7.85 mm (5.81 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches) Weight 199 g (7.03 oz) 206 g (7.27 oz) Screen 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR OLED 1206 x 2622 pixels ProMotion with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate Dolby Vision, 2,000 nits brightness 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED 1179 x 2556 pixels ProMotion with 120Hz dynamic refresh rate Dolby Vision, 2,000 nits brightness Operating system iOS 18 iOS 18 Build Titanium with textured\n\nmatt glass back Stainless steel with textured matt glass back Buttons Action Button\n\nCamera Control Ring/Silent switch Storage 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB Processor Apple A18 Pro Six-core CPU Six-core GPU 16-core NPU Apple A16 Bionic Six-core CPU Five-core GPU 16-core NPU Camera Rear: 48-megapixel primary, f/1.8, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 120\u00b0 FOV 12MP telephoto, f/2.8, 5x optical zoom Front: 12MP, f/1.9 aperture Rear: 48MP primary, f/1.78, OIS 48MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 120\u00b0 FOV 12MP telephoto, f/1.78, 3x optical zoom Front: 12MP, f/1.9 aperture Video Rear: 4K, up to 120 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Rear: 4K, up to 60 fps Front: 4K, up to 60 fps Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, dual-band Bluetooth 5.3 Wi-Fi 6, dual-band Bluetooth 5.3 Ports USB-C Gen 3.2 DisplayPort Lightning USB 2.0 Water resistance IP68 (maximum depth of 6m up to 30 minutes) IP68 (maximum depth of 6m up to 30 minutes) Battery & charging Up to 23 hours video playback 45W fast charging 25W wireless charging via MagSafe 15W Qi2 wireless charging Up to 27 hours video playback 25W fast charging 15W wireless charging via MagSafe 7.5W Qi wireless charging Colors Black Titanium, White Titanium, Natural Titanium, Desert Titanium Space Black, Silver, Gold, Deep Purple Price Starts at $999 Starts at $999\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: design and display\n\nThere isn\u2019t much to discuss here about any design overhaul, as the fundamental aesthetic language is identical. However, there are a few refinements that can only be felt when the two devices are held in hand. The iPhone 16 Pro is slightly taller and thicker than the iPhone 14 Pro, and a touch lighter too. That weight disparity predominantly has to do with the build\u2019s material of choice. The latest flagship from Apple relies on titanium, which is lighter, more resilient, and better equipped to handle heat dissipation. The iPhone 14 Pro, on the other hand, has a stainless steel frame married to a matte glass shell.\n\nAnother crucial difference concerns the edges. The iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s sides were quite sharp and the phone dug into the palm in quite an uncomfortable fashion. The iPhone 16 Pro takes a more rounded approach to the edges, making it cozier to hold, if not a day-and-night difference.\n\nApple has also slimmed down the bezels to accommodate a larger display on the phone. With the iPhone 16 Pro, you also get USB-C (Gen 3 port with Display Port support) with 10Gbps output as it ditches the Lightning Port (USB Gen 2) on the iPhone 14 Pro. In a nutshell, you get faster data transfer bandwidth and liberation from the dongle life.\n\nThe ingress protection is identical across both phones at an IP68 level, but the color options vary. The iPhone 16 Pro serves up a new Desert Titanium look that\u2019s somewhat inspired by the gold trim on the iPhone 16 Pro, but the latter\u2019s signature Deep Purple is gone. The rest of Apple\u2019s latest options include silver, white, and black.\n\nAnother core difference, as mentioned above, is the display. The iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3-inch panel, up from the 6.1-inch OLED screen on the iPhone 14 Pro. The rest of the attributes, such as pixel density, peak refresh rate, and brightness output remain identical. Apple says the latest iteration of Ceramic Shield on the iPhone 16 Pro is twice as strong, while the OLED panel\u2019s brightness can drop to as low as 1 nit, which is technically great news from the lens of power efficiency.\n\nAnother crucial change is the introduction of two extra buttons on the iPhone 16 Pro that replace the mute switch on the iPhone 14 Pro. The Action button has already become a favorite of folks for folks looking to execute tasks or even shortcuts with the press of a button.\n\nThis year, we also get the Camera Control, a physical button with a capacitive side to it. It\u2019s a camera shutter in spirit, but can do a lot more. Using slide gestures, it can also handle adjustments like ISO or zoom level, among other camera controls.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: camera\n\nFor users deep into video capture and engaged in professional workflows, the latest from Apple offers plenty. Both phones rely on a mostly identical 48-megapixel main camera and a 12MP zoom camera, but the iPhone 16 Pro takes things up a notch by upgrading the 12MP ultrawide lens to a 48MP sensor.\n\nAnother crucial upgrade is the inherent zoom architecture. The iPhone 14 Pro has a 3x optical range using a lens tunnel system for zooming. The iPhone 16 Pro reaches a 5x optical zoom range, thanks to the tetra prism lens architecture that was first seen on the iPhone 15 Pro Max. It also jumps to the Smart HDR 5 pipeline for more effective color contrast output.\n\nOn the imaging side, the iPhone 16 Pro enables full 48MP macro capture and can also take Spatial Pictures suited for viewing on the Apple Vision Pro headset. There are also new photographic styles on the table, alongside a new pad adjustment system to achieve the exact strength of a specific style. While that sounds appealing, it\u2019s really the video capture side of things where the iPhone 16 Pro races into an altogether different league.\n\nTo start, the rear camera can now shoot 4K Dolby Vision videos at both 100 frames per second (fps) and 120 fps, and the results look incredible. Of course, for users who like more control over their video edits, the phone also opens the doors for log capture (with support for the Academy Color Encoding System), something the iPhone 14 Pro misses out on.\n\nApple has also armed the iPhone 16 Pro with four studio-quality mics, and they play a supremely important role. Apple claims they deliver more true-to-life sounds. The trick in question is audio mixing. Essentially, when you shoot a video, you can pick between directional audio presets like in-frame, studio, and cinematic. These presets let users focus on a certain audio sources in their video. The samples captured by users suggest that it works really well.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: performance and software\n\nThe biggest shift between the iPhone 14 Pro and its 16-series counterpart is the processor, which not only stands out based on hardware merits, but also opens the doors for an entirely new software experience courtesy of Apple Intelligence.\n\nNow, depending on how excited you are about AI, you may or may not make an upgrade choice, but here\u2019s the lowdown. The A16 Bionic in the iPhone 14 Pro is based on TSMC\u2019s 4nm process, and it serves a six-core CPU and a five-core graphics engine. The iPhone 16 Pro\u2019s A18 Pro, built atop the newer 3nm node, packs six graphics cores.\n\nThe lift in processing firepower stands at 30%, while the GPU performance is improved by 40% this time around. Even compared to the mighty A17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro, Apple is touting a two-fold gain in hardware-accelerated ray tracing performance in games. It\u2019s just that there are only a handful of games out there that can push ray tracing on the new and improved flagship iPhone.\n\nNow, both iPhones have already received the iOS 18 update, but the experience is going to be quite different. The biggest upgrade is Siri interactions, which are not only a lot more natural, but also dig deeper into apps for seamless integration to get work done. It can even handle multimedia content editing using voice commands.\n\nThat means not only can Siri more efficiently perform tasks across different apps (both in-house and third-party), but it can also look into the details stored by these apps and accordingly respond to user queries. Additionally, when it can\u2019t handle certain queries, they will be offloaded to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack. The Notes app gets Writing Tools that let you handle rewrites, corrections, formatting, and summarization with a single click. AI smarts have also been extended to the Mail app, where they enable email summarization as well as smart reply suggestions.\n\nApp notifications are also intelligently brought together, summarized, and passed through focus filters. It works really well, though the system takes a few days to assess the app interaction habit before it can fine-tune the notification behavior. Another cool perk is automatic transcription and voice notes that can also be summarized with a single click.\n\nOn the more fun side of things, users will be able to convert rough sketches into beautiful drawings with a simple highlight and selection gesture. The Image Playground feature brings text-to-image facility across different places, including Messages.\n\nAlso, for users who often run into the need to look up Apple\u2019s product guides online, Siri will save them a browser trip, as the virtual assistant has ingested those guides and will offer step-by-step instructions right in the dialog box. Another cool upgrade is Screen Awareness, which lets the AI assistant take a peek at the onscreen content and answer contextual queries.\n\nApple Intelligence really is a big difference here \u2014 but it\u2019s worth remembering that Apple Intelligence isn\u2019t available yet, even on iOS 18. Instead, it will launch with iOS 18.1.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: battery and charging\n\nOne of the most notable quality-of-life upgrades offered by the iPhone 16 Pro is improved mileage, as well as faster charging. The iPhone 16 Pro is claimed to last for 27 hours of video playback on a single charge, while the iPhone 14 Pro could only manage 23 hours. That translated into a single day of charge in the iPhone 14 Pro\u2019s real-life use, but we won\u2019t know if the iPhone 16 Pro can meet or exceed this until we\u2019ve had time with it.\n\nAccording to regulatory data, the iPhone 16 Pro can technically reach a wired charging pace of 45 watts, which is dramatically faster than the iPhone 14 Pro. Additionally, the Qi wireless charging pace has reached 15W, up from 7.5W on the iPhone 15 Pro.\n\nApple has also boosted the MagSafe output for its latest flagship. The iPhone 16 Pro can reach a MagSafe power delivery peak of 25W when paired with a 30W brick, while the iPhone 14 Pro could only muster 15W for juicing up the lithium-ion unit packed inside its glass-metal chassis.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs iPhone 14 Pro: availability and price\n\nThe Apple iPhone 16 Pro is now available for sale. The base model of the phone will set you back $999, with more storage costing more and rising all the way to a 1TB option. The Apple iPhone 14 Pro is similar, with the same storage options and an initial starting price of $999.\n\nHowever, given the latter\u2019s older age, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll find the iPhone 14 Pro at a much lower price than the newer flagship. During sales periods, it could be significantly so, making it a much more attractive option to those looking for a bargain.\n\niPhone 16 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro: should you upgrade?\n\nThe Apple iPhone 16 Pro, as mentioned above, is pushing the envelope with both software- and hardware-side innovations. But that also begs the question \u2014 is the iPhone 14 Pro a laggard that demands an upgrade just two years into its product life?\n\nWell, the answer depends on how much utility you are going to get out of the exclusive iPhone 16 Pro perks.\n\nThe biggest differentiator, of course, is Apple Intelligence. The AI-driven overhaul of iOS 18 puts Siri and next-gen machine learning capabilities into every corner of the iPhone\u2019s software. And over time, those AI conversations \u2014 especially Siri integrations \u2014 will appear inside third-party apps, as well. Ultimately, it will boil down to how much one has grown weary of the boring iOS experience and seeks to experience what a next-generation AI-driven experience feels like.\n\nThen we have the camera chops. Now, the iPhone is still one of the nicest smartphone camera systems out there, and that applies to the iPhone 14 Pro as much as the iPhone 16 Pro. Is the newer phone better? Yes. Is it a big enough gulf that you\u2019ll feel like the older phone is missing out? That\u2019s less likely.\n\nHowever, if you intend to push your phone in terms of ultrawide capture and, more importantly, videos that try to challenge a DSLR, the enhanced zoom and high-fps Dolby Vision perks will really light up a social media feed with stunning samples.\n\nNow, Apple has kept the asking price the same, which is great news and makes the upgrade even more compelling. For those who can score a good trade-in deal, and can absorb the deficit hit on their wallet, the iPhone 16 Pro is absolutely worth the jump. For the rest, the iPhone 14 Pro is still enough to last at least another year, or two, with ease."

Both have thousands of servers worldwide and boast high-speed streaming and download capacity without sacrificing security and privacy.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly hard to choose between these leading VPNs when the pricing is so close. I recently reviewed NordVPN and Proton VPN, so I\u2019ll share details about pricing and renewal costs, hands-on speed tests, and customer service responsiveness.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nUltimately, I\u2019ll share my recommendation for the best VPN to fit your budget while protecting your privacy and delivering consistently great performance.\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nStarting at the free tier, Proton VPN takes the lead with a full-featured app that can connect to 136 servers in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Japan. There\u2019s no data cap or artificial limits placed on speed. Proton VPN is among the best free VPNs with few restrictions. NordVPN doesn\u2019t have a free version.\n\nBoth offer a 30-day money-back guarantee but no trial period. That means you have to pay for a subscription to try the full version of either VPN. Each company supports 10 devices with paid service so you can use the VPN on all your devices and share with family members.\n\nNordVPN costs $13 per month, while Proton VPN comes in at $10 monthly. The best value comes with a longer subscription. NordVPN starts at $60 for the first year, but renews at $139.08. The equivalent monthly cost is $5 initially, but increases to $12 thereafter. A two-year subscription starts at $97 and includes three free months. That works out to $3.60 monthly, a great deal for 27 months. But watch out for the renewal cost, which skyrockets to $313.\n\nProton VPN has a less expensive $10 monthly plan and matches NordVPN\u2019s $60 annual subscription. The two-year plan costs $108. Proton doesn\u2019t charge more when you need to renew, so both monthly and renewal costs are better.\n\nBoth services have software bundles that add more features if you pay more.\n\nFeatures\n\nWhen I reviewed NordVPN, I was more than satisfied with its speed and reliability. I consistently enjoyed quick server connections and download speeds measuring 32% to 52% of my gigabit Ethernet connection. That\u2019s hundreds of megabits per second worldwide.\n\nAs impressive as NordVPN\u2019s performance was, Proton VPN nearly matched it by delivering 26% to 50% of my unprotected internet download speed. Proton VPN suffered from slow uploads, a common complaint with even the best VPNs.\n\nWhile NordVPN managed up to 29 Mbps uploads, the best I got with Proton VPN was 14 Mbps. To be fair, server connections are generally optimized for downloading content, with only a bit reserved to keep the connection responsive as you search and browse.\n\nBoth feature solid VPN connections to thousands of servers in over 100 countries. To get around administrative firewallls, NordVPN has the NordLynx protocol and Proton VPN has Stealth.\n\nSupport\n\nNordVPN has an advantage when it comes to customer service. You can search and browse the support center for help documents. If you run into a problem that you can\u2019t figure out on your own, NordVPN offers 24/7 live chat. I tested the response time and found it to be quick and informative.\n\nProton VPN provides live chat support for paid subscribers, but only during business hours. Still, you can get help quickly during a 15-hour window daily. I received fast and thorough replies to my questions. If you reach out when live chat is closed, Proton\u2019s support documents are available anytime.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nNordVPN prioritizes user privacy with a strict no-logs policy and no data sharing with third parties. Like all good VPNs, NordVPN uses end-to-end encryption to protect your data, as well as hides your IP address and location.\n\nProton VPN is open-source software with a privacy focus, a strict no-logs policy, and secure data storage practices. Proton was founded by CERN scientists in 2014 to ensure private communications and carries that mission forward with all its apps and services.\n\nBoth service get regular independent audits to check security and verify that no logs are retained. Your data should be secure and private with either VPN.\n\nWhich VPN is right for you?\n\nAs you can tell, NordVPN and Proton VPN are closely matched,with similar pricing and features. The primary difference is in pricing tiers. NordVPN offers more bundle variety, which might be appealing if you have particular needs that Proton VPN can\u2019t meet affordably.\n\nFor some people, Proton Free might be all they need. It\u2019s fast, free, and includes free versions of Proton VPN, Proton Mail, Proton Pass, and more.\n\nIf you need access to more servers, but for a limited time, Proton VPN\u2019s monthly fee is less expensive than NordVPN\u2019s. If you anticipate long-term use of a VPN, Proton VPN\u2019s consistent pricing when you renew means you\u2019ll continue saving when it comes time to renew your subscription.\n\nFor most people, Proton VPN is the best solution whether you use the free version or subscribe.\n\nIf neither solution seems like a good fit, there are plenty of fast and reliable VPNs to choose from. It\u2019s also worth checking out our list of VPN deals to see if you can save some money while protecting your privacy."
