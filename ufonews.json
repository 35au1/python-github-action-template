It has been debunked since 2021.\n\nFact Check:\n\nSocial media users are claiming to show a UFO in the woods of Germany. (RELATED: Is The Pentagon Using \u2018Operation Necromancer\u2019 To Intercept Drones?)\n\n\u201cMASSIVE UAP SIGHTING OVER SELVA NEGRA, GERMANY!!\n\nYou won\u2019t believe this!!\n\nBack in June 2024, a HUGE UAP was spotted over Selva Negra (Black Forest), Alemania \u2013 and it left witnesses STUNNED!\n\nReports describe a gigantic craft hovering silently, flashing strange lights, and then VANISHING without a trace!\n\nWhat was this?? Advanced tech? Alien visitors? This sighting is TOO CRAZY to ignore!!\n\nGermany\u2019s skies might be hiding some deep mysteries!\u201d one user wrote.\n\nThe original was shared by a VFX artist, according to a YouTube video by Mick West, the founder of metabunk.org. The original video has since been deleted, but West says that the original uploader said the video was \u201cjust a test.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis video was created by a 3D artist who posts on YouTube as \u2018VFX\u2019. It\u2019s been re-uploaded a few times as an actual UFO video, and fooled a few people \u2013 even people commenting on VFX\u2019s channel! Looking at the repeating textures in the road shows that it\u2019s a CGI fake,\u201d reads part of West\u2019s YouTube video description.\n\nFull Fact also debunked this claim."

            "article_content": "ChatGPT is OpenAI's extremely useful chatbot for answering questions. Here's how to use the generative AI tool in Apple's Notes app in macOS.\n\nApple Intelligence is now integrated with OpenAi's ChatGPT in macOS, ad well as iOS and iPadOS. Many features of ChatGPT are integrated with Apple apps starting in macOS Sequoia 15.1, and iOS and iPadOS 18.2.\n\nWhile Apple has stated support for Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT are evolving and still in progress, some features are working and included in Apple's operating systems. Expect a further phased rollout of Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT in the near future.\n\nFor a complete review of new Apple Intelligence iOS and iPadOS features, see our article iOS 18.1 & iPadOS 18.1 review: baby steps with Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn order to use ChatGPT in Notes, you have to have a subscription to ChatGPT Plus ($20/month), Pro, Enterprise, Team, or Educational. OpenAI has stated support for ChatGPT free tier integration in macOS will be coming later in 2025.\n\nOpenAI has a pricing page, and at $20/month, the Plus tier is fairly reasonable. Plus or higher also gives you access to o1 and o1-mini models.\n\nIf you already have Apple Intelligence and the ChatGPT extension enabled, skip to the last section \"Using ChatGPT in Notes\". Even so, the next section below has some useful info on where ChatGPT is available in Apple apps.\n\nWhat's included\n\nIn the above versions of Apple's operating systems, Apple states Apple Intelligence is integrated into Notes, Photos, Siri, Safari, and other apps with Writing Tools. ChatGPT is also integrated into some of the apps.\n\nFor example, you can now use ChatGPT prompts in Siri for lookups. Apple Intelligence Writing Tools work anywhere there is a text field.\n\nWriting Tools include summarizing text, rewriting text, proofreading, and even composing text. Apple also provides summaries in the form of Notification summaries, web page summaries, and others.\n\nSummaries for web pages in browsers are particularly useful. Some third-party browsers such as Firefox also support summaries.\n\nYou can turn off Notification summaries separately in System Settings->Notifications->Summarize Notifications.\n\nApple promises that using Apple Intelligence does not send your data to Apple (although some parts of Siri can still require this).\n\nTurning on Apple Intelligence\n\nBefore you can use ChatGPT in Apple's apps you must first turn on Apple Intelligence in the System Settings app (or the Settings app in iOS).\n\nTo do so, open System Settings in the /Applications folder on your Startup Disk (or from the Apple menu), then scroll down and click on Apple Intelligence & Siri on the left.\n\nNext, on the right, click Get Apple Intelligence to begin the setup process. After clicking the button it will be replaced with text reading \"In Progress...\" while the additional software is downloaded and installed.\n\nThis may take a while (up to an hour or more on some Macs).\n\nWait for Apple Intelligence to install and set up.\n\nOnce that is completed, you'll get a notification that your Mac is ready to use Apple Intelligence. The System Settings button will reappear, but this time it reads Set Up Apple Intelligence.\n\nClicking that button displays a sheet that walks you through setting up each feature of Apple Intelligence. This is not unlike the sheets that appear when you set up a new Mac.\n\nThe first step is choosing which apps use summaries. You can skip this part by clicking Set Up Later if you don't want summaries.\n\nClick \"Set Up Apple Intelligence\" to get started.\n\nNext, you'll step through Siri setup, but mind that there's no way to opt-out on the sheet at this point. The setup notifies you that Siri may send some of your data to Apple (including audio), but that the data is not tied to your Apple account.\n\nClick Continue, then select a Siri Voice from the list provided. Click Continue again.\n\nNow the sheet gives you a chance to opt out of sending your data to Apple if you want. Click Not now to opt-out, then click Continue.\n\nApple Intelligence and Siri are now fully enabled and you can turn either off or back on by using the two sliders that appear in System Settings. Also now enabled at the bottom of the Apple Intelligence & Siri pane is an Extensions section, one of which is for ChatGPT:\n\nApple Intelligence installed and enabled in macOS Sequoia.\n\nTurning on ChatGPT\n\nGo ahead and click ChatGPT under Extensions to set up ChatGPT. There's also a slider for determining if you want to allow Siri to recommend using ChatGPT in some instances.\n\nNext, click the Set Up... button next to Use ChatGPT.\n\nYou'll now get another sheet telling you what ChatGPT can do: integrate with Siri, compose text in Writing Tools, and work with a ChatGPT account. Click Next - which leads you to another sheet informing you that the Mac works with ChatGPT in a way that preserves your privacy:\n\nYou decide what gets shared with ChatGPT You can turn ChatGPT off in System Settings any time You can use ChatGPT with an account, or use it anonymously\n\nIf you want to use ChatGPT with an account, click the Use ChatGPT with an Account button. Otherwise, click the Enable ChatGPT button to use it anonymously.\n\nClick \"Set Up...\" to begin the setup of the ChatGPT extension.\n\nThere's also a privacy note button that gives you a text summary of Apple's and OpenAI's policy on ChatGPT privacy in the extension. If you want, you can Select All (Command-A) on the text, copy it by Control-clicking, then paste it into a file in TextEdit or another editor for later review.\n\nOf particular note are these paragraphs:\n\n\"If there is no explicit request to use ChatGPT, your request is analyzed to determine whether ChatGPT might have useful results. If it does, Siri will ask whether you would like to use ChatGPT. If you choose, Siri will send your request to ChatGPT and present the answer directly. You also can choose to disable Siri asking you to confirm whether Siri should send a request to ChatGPT by going to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri > ChatGPT, and tapping to turn off Confirm ChatGPT Requests.\n\nWhen you use Writing Tools and visual intelligence with the Camera Control, you will be able to choose whether you would like to use the ChatGPT extension for each of these features separately.\"\n\nThe note then goes on to explain that, in anonymous mode, it is OpenAI's official policy that it must not store requests, or their results (unless required by law), and it must not use requests to train its models. Attached documents are also not stored in anonymous mode.\n\nIn anonymous mode, OpenAI does not receive any info about your Apple account, and your IP address is hidden from OpenAI servers. General location information is however sent for the purposes of \"enabling ChatGPT to prevent fraud and comply with applicable law\".\n\nYou can turn off ChatGPT and its interaction with Apple Intelligence in the Extensions pane at any time, in the same way that you turned it on. You can also leave Apple Intelligence and/or Siri turned on, even if you turn the ChatGPT extension off.\n\nAfter you've read and understood the Privacy statement, return to the Extension pane, and click Enable ChatGPT. Once ChatGPT is enabled in System Settings, you can later click the Sign In button, and turn it off entirely using the slider.\n\nOpenAI \"Advanced Capabilities\" are free up to a certain limit, then basic ChatGPT functionality is available until twenty-four hours have elapsed.\n\nThere's also a slider for confirming Siri requests.\n\nThis completes the set up of both Apple Intelligence and the ChatGPT extension.\n\nUsing ChatGPT in Notes\n\nOnce Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT have been enabled, you can now use them in Writing Tools in any app that supports text editing - including the Notes app.\n\nCurrently to use ChatGPT/Notes integration you have to be signed into a ChatGPT account because OpenAI has to verify your paid pricing tier. If you're not signed in, go back to the Extension pane in System Settings for ChatGPT and click the Sign In button.\n\nYou'll also need to go to the Settings page for your ChatGPT account, enable the Works With Apps setting, then click Manage Apps to select which apps you want to allow ChatGPT to work with.\n\nTo use ChatGPT in Notes, open the Notes app, select any note on the left, then press Option+Shift+1 on your keyboard. This brings up the ChatGPT prompt in which you can type a question to get an answer for the information contained in the selected note.\n\nIf, for some reason, the Note can't be processed, ChatGPT servers can't be reached, or you're not signed in to ChatGPT, you'll hear the macOS system sound.\n\nThere's also a voice mode you can enable to control ChatGPT.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nChatGPT integration with Apple apps is exciting because it promises to take automation to a whole new level. This includes lookups, summaries, editing, condensing, composing, and more.\n\nWhat would really be cool would be for Apple to provide some other automation features from a UI standpoint (much like AppleScript does today). For example, one could imagine telling ChatGPT to select all notes with certain titles or content, and then merging them, condensing their content, removing parts of content, or sending them somewhere else.\n\nVoice control combined with UI interaction could be really powerful.\n\nImagine having one hundred notes in the Notes app and telling ChatGPT to \"Merge all notes containing Apple-related content\". That could save hours.\n\nThe possibilities may be endless."

            "article_content": "Washington: Billionaire Elon Musk has once again raised his concern against OpenAI's transition from a non-profit to a for-profit organisation after an interview of Suchir Balaji's mother with political analyst Tucker Carlson came out. Resharing the interview clip, where Poornima Rap casts her doubt over the current investigation into her son's death, Musk posted it with the caption, \"Extremely concerning.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO has been repeatedly raising concerns over Suchir Balaji's death case. Earlier when the initial investigation claimed it to be suicide, Musk responded to the plea made by the mother of OpenAi Whistleblower Suchir Balaji saying, \u201cThis doesn't seems a suicide\u201d, in which she called for an FBI investigation following her son's death. Balaji accused the AI giant of copyright violations, and he was found dead a month after the allegations surfaced.\n\n'He Had Documents.. They Killed Him': Suchir Mother's Big Charges\n\nIn the explosive interview with Carlson, Suchir's mother some big claims and charges over her son's death case and the secrecy in the world of AI.\n\nWhen asked about how she feels if her son has killed himself, recalling the time when the San Francisco medics declared that her son died by suicide, Poornima said, \"My son celebrated his birthday a day before he died. What more do we need to give on account that he was in a happy mood?\" adding that he even received birthday gift from his father the same day he was later found dead.\n\nMaking a grave allegation against OpenAI, Poornima said, \"My son had documents against OpenAI. They attacked him and killed him,\" adding that \"some documents were missing\" after his death.\n\nPoornima also accused the ChatGPT maker of hushing up the probe and any possible witnesses, saying \"Everybody is suppressed, nobody is ready to come up and tell the truth. Even the attorneys have been made to say that it is a suicide.\"\n\nContinuing her verbal attack against OpenAI, Suchir Balaji accused the authorities over the investigation, Poornima also said, \"It took them (authorities) more than 14 minutes to determine the cause of death and tell me that it was a suicide.\"\n\n\"I knew that my son was dead by looking at the white van. In the evening, they returned the keys to me and told me that I could pick up the body tomorrow.\"\n\nWho was Suchir Balaji?\n\nSuchir Balaji, a 26-year-old Indian-American tech researcher who openly criticized the use of copyrighted data in artificial intelligence (AI), was found dead in his San Francisco apartment. He joined OpenAI in 2019 and during his four years at the company, he worked on several projects, including GPT-4 training and improving ChatGPT\u2019s performance. He left OpenAI in August this year, expressing concerns over the potential harm OpenAI could cause. During his tenure, he played a significant role in data collection for OpenAI's flagship product, ChatGPT.\n\nOn his website, Balaji elaborated on his concerns, claiming that OpenAI's method of copying data for training its models potentially amounted to copyright infringement. He touched on issues like the ethical risks of generative AI and potential copyright violations, which have ignited a broader debate within the tech industry and beyond.\n\nJust a day before his death, Balaji\u2019s name was mentioned in a copyright lawsuit against OpenAI. Though details about his involvement remain unclear, his public criticism of the company\u2019s data usage practices likely drew attention to his stance on ethical AI development. Suchir Balaji had accused OpenAI of training its AI models on copyrighted material scraped from the internet without proper authorization, a practice he argued was detrimental. \"If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,\" Balaji said in an interview with The New York Times earlier this year. The Indian-origin tech professional resigned from OpenAI in October 2023 after nearly four years with the company."

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter.\n\nLooking to keep your content fresh and relevant in 2025?\n\nThis will help. Today, Pinterest has launched its second annual \u201cPinterest Palette\u201d report, which provides an overview of key color trends in the app, based on research conducted for its Pinterest Predicts trends listing.\n\nAs explained by Pinterest:\n\n\u201cThe Pinterest Palette offers marketers inspiration driven by what over half a billion Pinners are searching, saving, and shopping for each month. Our in-house creative and insights teams worked hand-in-hand to map Pinterest Predicts trends and color clusters against first-party platform Pin color data. Looking at actions like saves, we were able to see which colors are driving engagement over time.\u201d\n\nThe report identifies the colors most likely to resonate with audiences this year, which Pinterest\u2019s team has narrowed down to five key hues.\n\nEach color gets its own overview, which includes Pin examples, hex codes, and a listing of tags related to that shade.\n\nIt\u2019s a good-looking report, which likely means that Pinterest has got the colors right, and they do feel fresh and vibrant, even if a bit Christmas-y.\n\n\u201cBrands can tap into the colors shaping the year ahead for mood boards, product launches, or creative campaigns. For example, health-focused condiment brand Primal Kitchen referenced Pinterest Predicts and the Pinterest Palette for their Colorful Kitchen Tour last year. Fusing the 2024 Pinterest Palette with their core brand colors, Primal Kitchen launched new dipping sauces with Predicts-inspired \u201cKitschens\u201d pop-ups in three major cities.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one way that you can use this insight, while it might also give you the spark of inspiration you need to refresh your branding efforts for the year ahead, with trending color tones that align with your audience.\n\nOr you might go with something else entirely, and that might also align with your customers\u2019 interests. There are no prescriptive rules here, but it is worth checking out Pinterest\u2019s color trends, and considering what they might mean for your brand efforts in 2025.\n\nYou can download Pinterest\u2019s \u201c2025 Pinterest Palette\u201d report here.\n\nRecommended Reading"

            "article_content": "The new Aurora Cloud Console, a groundbreaking, free-to-use plug-and-play solution for setting up your own decentralized network, has made it easier to create a blockchain than ever before.\n\nAurora Labs said in an announcement today that it\u2019s targeting decentralized application and memecoin developers who\u2019re fed up with the sluggish transaction speeds and lack of customization options on better-known blockchains such as Ethereum. Instead of deploying your dApp or token on that network, the Aurora Cloud Console gives you the option of creating a dedicated and customized blockchain for your own purposes.\n\nIn this way, it\u2019s breaking new ground in blockchain accessibility by tearing down the technical barriers to building decentralized networks.\n\nPreviously, the only people who would even dare to try and create their own blockchains are developers who possess years of expertise in software development, as well as knowledge of specialist programming languages like Solidity.\n\nWhat Aurora Lab\u2019s platform provides\n\nNow, it\u2019s possible for absolutely anyone to create their own blockchain, using Aurora\u2019s sophisticated no-code platform. Aurora Cloud Console aims to make the task as simple as creating an online store using a service such as Shopify. All you have to do is follow the step-by-step instructions, where you\u2019ll set parameters such as the gas fees, the native token and the kinds of permissions available. Once done, it will handle all the nasty, technical coding stuff for you. The end result will be a highly scalable Aurora Virtual Chain based on NEAR Protocol\u2019s ultra-rapid infrastructure, boasting superfast transaction speeds, EVM-compatibility and enterprise-grade security, plus access to a vast ecosystem of other dApps and Web3 services.\n\nAurora Labs has aspirations to get as many as 1,000 connected blockchains up and running by the end of the year. It\u2019s targeting creators of memecoins and other Web3 projects, and argues that building your own, customized EVM-compatible network will be the fastest way to scale.\n\nThe arrival of Aurora Cloud Console comes after the debut of TurboChain last month. That new network was one of the very first Aurora Virtual Chains to be deployed. It\u2019s a dedicated chain for the popular meme coin TURBO, which was previously deployed on Ethereum. By launching its own chain, the TURBO coin community is setting itself up for further growth, enabling users to pay their transaction gas fees using the TURBO token instead of ETH.\n\nAurora Labs Chief Executive Alex Shevchenko spelled out how big a deal the new platform really is, saying it allows anyone to create a fully customizable chain from scratch within days.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve removed the complexity, so builders can focus on creating great products while tapping into a thriving ecosystem of liquidity, tools, and users,\u201d the executive explained. \u201cAurora Cloud Console is the gateway to Web3.\u201d\n\nCoingape Staff CoinGape comprises an experienced team of native content writers and editors working round the clock to cover news globally and present news as a fact rather than an opinion.

Tobias H\u00fcttl, Head of Design Studio at Porsche, kindly sat down with me to answer a few questions on this automotive design collaboration for Honor's new Magic 7 series.\n\nHonor and Porsche have collaborated for three generations of smartphones now, starting with the Honor Magic V2, followed by the Porsche Design Magic 6. The newest Honor Magic7 RSR from Porshe Design however takes this to new levels, yet continues the iconic hexagonal camera design trend that we\u2019ve seen on previous Porsche X Honor handsets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was invited by Honor to the stunning resort of Bled in Slovenia this week to see first-hand the new Magic 7 AI devices (including the indestructible Magic 7 Lite), and to experience the company's innovations in advanced durable AI technology. This Porsche handset is not only exquisite, but ignites an existing trend of merging premium sports car-inspired design with the latest tech. Tobias H\u00fcttl shares the Magic7 RSR colour selection and design process.\n\nImage 1 of 1\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nDo you have a favourite aspect of the RSR 7 phone? A favourite design element?\n\nI like the fact that you can hold it in your hand and it feels premium and special, right? Without needing a visual of it. So I think that's very nice. And I also like the sharp edges that you can feel around the camera unit at the back, I think that's adding this very central quality that helps people appreciate the project.\n\nCan you tell me a bit about the colours of the Honor Magic7 RSR Porsche design?\n\nThe two colours that we have are Agate Grey and Provence. With those colours, we hoped to differentiate quite strongly between customer choices. Provence is much more subtle than the Frozen Berry Metallic [this was a colour option available with the Magic 6] which is more vibrant, and as the name suggests, more like an ice cream. But the Provence is something that\u2019s toned down, less reflective, with less saturation. I think it's also a little bit more bluish compared to the Frozen Berry.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe've tried different directions, and then the choice finally fell on the Provence. We think it's a bit of a mystery colour, and it's something that's still subtle, but at the same time, I think that's something that we like a lot about it. It's not resembling a super strong race car colour or anything. It's elegant still, even though it's something that people can recognize and see as something special.\n\nIs there a reason why you didn't opt for turbonite as a colour choice for the phone?\n\n[This is the popular grey Pantone hue that was made exclusively for Porsche].\n\nSo the turbonite is interesting because it's dedicated to Porsche's turbo collection, right? So with our phone not being a turbo phone, it would not have been a very consistent story.\n\nRead more: Porsche's turbonite is the most surprising colour trend of NYFW\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage 1 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nImage 2 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImage 3 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nImage 4 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nImage 5 of 5\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nIs this handset trying to sell a smartphone to a Porsche owner, or a Porsche to Honor customers?\n\nIt can work both ways. I mean, in the end, I think that the product should stand for itself. It should have a quality for itself, character for itself. There is a connection, for sure, with everything that's in the Porsche cosmos and with the Porsche DNA as well. We think that it's grown up enough to hold its own justification and attraction as a product.\n\nHow did you work with Honor over decisions such as colour, material, and form?\n\nIn the beginning, with the ideation phase, we're very broad. So we are looking into all different kinds of directions and ideas, but then there are certain colours which work in certain settings and maybe not in others. Some things make sense with the design of the car but not so much within the phone world.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWith Honor, we kind of sit down and discuss together what's the common denominator within our understanding of aesthetics, and then we find the right material for the right product. Materials are always something that we are interested in. If you look at the phones, materials are one of the differentiating factors.\n\nDid you seek any feedback from customers and fans of the brand?\n\nThere's lots of input from all kinds of dimensions. So there are customer inputs, and there's also market inputs that we have within our broader corporation, but eventually, we made a decision with what colour to go with on an informed basis.\n\nWere there any big design decisions that you couldn't agree on?\n\nIt's always like that. I think that\u2019s the nature of design. You come up with a lot of ideas, but then again, I think it's very important to also have restrictions in the design process. So it was the balance between something that people think of without any kind of limitations, and that's what's possible on the other side, and in the end, you find the best solution with a product that's feasible and aesthetically pleasing. There are mostly technical limitations. Things like user habits and economics people have that we have to take into account.\n\nImage 1 of 1\n\nHonor Porsche Magic 7 RSR\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nDid Porsche Design have any input on the software within the Magic 7 series?\n\nSo what was important for us on the software part is that we have one design, for hardware and software, and we had a strong impact on the graphics for the user interface buttons as well, to make it a homogeneous experience as a user. There are new software features [compared with the Honor Magic 6] within the new iOS, so we've also taken that into account for the design elements.\n\nDo you feel that the crossover between automotive design and global fashion trends will eventually have the same weight in the smartphone industry?\n\nThat's very interesting. I think that people hold phones very dearly, and I think that's something that everyone has to deal with. So naturally, I think phones and cars are things that people will consider a very attractive product in their minds. So to think about the relationship of those two things is always important.\n\nIs there a colour that you absolutely would not consider for this particular brand of phone?\n\nI think it's always content-specific. It has to fit with the nature of the product and in this case with the RSR 7, I think the two colours that we have address a lot of customer needs. So you can have a buyer who is the subtle type, and the other one might be a bit more of the extrovert type. And I think it's a good mixture of colours. So I would say we keep this open. I wouldn't include all the colours. But logistically it's interesting.\n\nThe new Honor Magic7 RSR phone design incorporates some of Porsche's signature elements, including the hexagonal shape of the camera unit (resembling sports car headlights) and the seamless integration and nods to the aerodynamic aesthetics of the Porsche Taycan Turbo S sports car.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen I asked Tobias which phone colour he preferred out of the two options, he suggested, \"personally, I would just get both\".\n\nIf you're interested in owning this ultra-premium smartphone for yourself, expect to spend a staggering \u00a31,549. This exclusive and limited smartphone will be available soon, but to be notified and register your interest, be sure to head to the Porsche website for all the details."

Bank of America sees it as a key differentiator for software companies.\n\n\u201cAgentic AI deployments could displace workers as early as 2H25 across industries, such as contact centers, software engineering and marketing,\u201d the firm noted.\n\nRelated: Analyst picks Microsoft as best stock to play AI spending surge in 2025\n\nThe second key trend is accelerated enterprise IT spending, which is expected to gather pace through 2026.\n\nTech heavyweights like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon are spending heavily on AI and will likely expand their investments in 2025.\n\n\u201cDemand continues to be higher than our available capacity,\u201d Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s finance chief, said during the company's earnings call last October.\n\nMoreover, sustained cloud migration remains a key growth driver for the software sector as optimization headwinds ease, Bank of America said.\n\n\"Although we remain selective on small caps, we are bullish on the software sector for 2025, particularly in 2H, as accelerating secular tailwinds and easing cyclical headwinds converge,\" the firm added.\n\nSo, who could be the winners in this gold rush? Bank of America has its bets.\n\nBank of America names Salesforce as its top pick for 2025\n\nBank of America sees potential for positive returns in undervalued names within subsectors like CRM (customer relationship management) and Infrastructure, which the firm identifies as particularly well-positioned for growth in 2025.\n\nRelated: Analysts reveal AI stock picks for 2025, including Palantir\n\nThe firm has named Salesforce (CRM) one of its top buys this year, alongside HubSpot (HUBS) , Microsoft (MSFT) , ServiceNow (NOW) , Datadog (DDOG) , GitLab (GTLB) , Global-e Online (GLBE) , Five9 (FIVN) , Monday.com (MNDY) , and Asana (ASAN) ."

China has been making agile policies that allow fast proof of concept, [as well as] failure and retry, which facilitates really quick iterations,\u201d said Ann Shi Yu, vice-president of autonomous driving company Pony.ai.\n\n\u201cThe competition in China is fiercer, which forces [companies] to progress,\u201d Shi said, noting that in the US only Alphabet-backed Waymo is capable of operating hundreds of fully autonomous robotaxis on public roads. In China, there is \u201cdefinitely more than one company doing that\u201d.\n\nPony.ai was operating around 250 robotaxis and roughly 190 robotrucks as of the end of 2024, according to Shi. Domestic rivals have also achieved a fleet size in the hundreds, including Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go which operates more than 400 robotaxis in Wuhan, Hubei province.\n\nThe panel discussion on AI at the Post\u2019s China Conference in Nansha on Wednesday.

            "article_content": "Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, recently told employees he believes the company\u2019s Gemini AI technology has surpassed the capabilities of competitors.\n\nGoogle\u2019s chief executive thinks his company has the best artificial-intelligence technology on the market. Now he has to get consumers to care.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai recently told employees he believes the company\u2019s Gemini AI technology has surpassed the capabilities of competitors and he wants the chatbot built on it to be used by 500 million people by the end of 2025, said people familiar with the matter.\n\nGoogle hasn\u2019t said how many people currently use Gemini, but market leader ChatGPT has about 300 million weekly users. The Gemini app was the 54th most downloaded free app on iPhones Wednesday. ChatGPT was No. 4.\n\nGoogle was caught flat-footed by the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, despite being one of the pioneers of AI and spending years working on similar chatbots. The company has been scrambling to catch up ever since.\n\nGemini isn\u2019t yet a serious moneymaker, but it is central to Google\u2019s push to stay on the cutting edge of AI, a technology already starting to reshape the company\u2019s core search and ads businesses.\n\nGoogle\u2019s newest AI technology jumped ahead of ChatGPT maker OpenAI\u2019s technology last month on the Chatbot Arena rankings closely watched by people in Silicon Valley. OpenAI dominated the rankings for much of the past year.\n\nGoogle launched the Gemini chatbot, formerly Bard, a few months after ChatGPT and has updated it with dozens of new features in an effort to gain ground. OpenAI, meanwhile, began directly targeting Google last summer when it added a web-search function to ChatGPT.\n\nThe ChatGPT mobile app has been downloaded about 465 million times on Android and iOS devices, compared with 106 million for Gemini, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nMost of those downloads came on Android phones. Until recently, Gemini was part of Google\u2019s search app on Apple devices. A separate Gemini app for iOS made its debut in November. Google said it was downloaded more than 10 million times through the end of the year.\n\nUsage of AI features built into other applications, such as Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram, aren\u2019t captured by publicly available measures.\n\nUntil recently, the Gemini chatbot team reported to the executive in charge of search and ads, but a recent reorganization moved it to the Google DeepMind division that does advanced research.\n\nPichai said at the time that the move would \u201cenable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app.\"\n\nGrowth in search advertising has slowed in recent years, and Google has increasingly looked to new business lines including subscriptions. It offers a premium version of Gemini with more features for $20 a month, similar to other chatbots.\n\nBut unlike its competitors, Google packages its Gemini subscription with perks including AI features in apps like Gmail and two terabytes of file storage.\n\nSifei Han, a data scientist living in Philadelphia, upgraded to the Gemini premium plan last year after being offered a two-month free trial. He said he mainly uses it for the extra storage, not the AI features.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more familiar with ChatGPT\u2019s style,\" said Han, who also pays for ChatGPT Plus.\n\nAbout 60% of Gemini\u2019s paying users kept their subscriptions six months after first signing up, according to an Earnest Analytics analysis of debit- and credit-card data from millions of anonymous consumers. That was better than some competitors such as Character.AI and Perplexity, but lagged behind OpenAI and Anthropic, which makes the chatbot Claude.\n\nSubscriptions to Gemini were a fraction of the $10.7 billion in revenue Google parent Alphabet made from subscriptions, device sales and purchases in its mobile app store in the three months ended September. Google\u2019s core advertising business brought in $65.9 billion during the same period. The company hasn\u2019t introduced ads in Gemini.\n\nGemini has been a source of controversy in the past. Google apologized to users and rolled back an image-generation feature last year after the chatbot produced images of Black soldiers in Nazi garb and sometimes refused to generate depictions of white people. It restored the feature six months later.\n\nIn addition to the chatbot, Gemini is powering features that perform complex tasks for users, like preparing research reports and generating podcasts based on a set of documents.\n\nGoogle sells the technology that powers Gemini to developers, uses it for the \u201cAI overviews\" that sometimes appear at the top of search results and recently began packaging it with the business versions of Gmail and Google Drive. Pichai has said all of Google\u2019s products with more than two billion users now have features powered by Gemini.\n\nThe company has also tried to convince device manufacturers to make Gemini the default assistant on mobile phones, which it already does on its own Pixel phones. Motorola and OnePlus, which both use Google\u2019s Android mobile software, made Gemini the default on some of their phones last year.\n\nWrite to Miles Kruppa at"

Her channels on both YouTube and Pornhub often share the same videos: math concept explainers that teach you what a neural network is or where the concept of pi came from, and which just happen to be delivered by an attractive woman in a low-cut top. As Dar explained on LinkedIn (via 404 Media), the same video will earn her $340 per million views on YouTube, and $1,000 per million views on Pornhub.\n\nAdmittedly, her videos get more views on YouTube because I imagine there are less people going to Pornhub to find out what integrals are. But there is a surprising amount of non-pornographic stuff on Pornhub, including loads of Minecraft let's play videos. Comedian Ryan Creamer has a whole channel of wholesome videos that just happen to have suggestive titles. (That link is still NSFW, by the way, unless your work is cool with you checking out Pornhub while you're on the clock like mine is. I hope.)\n\nDar told 404 Media that she's not entirely sure why her videos are doing so well on Pornhub, \"but it could be because my SFW videos stand out against the typical NSFW content on the platform. That contrast might make them more intriguing or refreshing to viewers. But that's just my speculation.\"\n\nAfter posting an explanation of her business model to LinkedIn, which briefly went viral, Dar's account on the website where business bros go to explain how great it is to ignore your family in favor of being a workaholic was banned. \"I was engaging professionally,\" she said, \"but LinkedIn's strict handling of this situation feels counterproductive to its purpose.\""

Image: Adobe Stock\n\nWhile the definitive diagnosis of iRBD requires in-laboratory video polysomnography, which can be both costly and challenging to interpret, a recent study used a 3D time-of-flight camera in a sleep laboratory with high accuracy, the researchers wrote.\n\nIn this study, During and colleagues sought to replicate and expand on those results utilizing a conventional 2D camera to monitor patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep difficulties and create a machine-learning analysis method, to replicate prior research attempted with a 3D lens in track sleep-related movements.\n\nTheir study featured 172 participants \u2014 81 with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls \u2014 evaluated between 2016 and 2022 at Stanford Sleep Center. The control group included 28 healthy sleepers and 63 individuals with other sleep disorders, who were matched to iRBD patients by age and sex.\n\nAll video-EEG polysomnography recordings were made with a 2D camera, shooting at 30 frames per second and were manually scored by two blinded sleep experts. A blinded sleep specialist also reviewed all recordings of iRBD patients to determine which individuals had visible movements in REM sleep.\n\nThe researchers then used an optical flow computer vision algorithm to analyze these recordings and extract features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility.\n\nAfter review, it was determined that the control group was comprised of 28 healthy individuals and 63 with a sleep disorder. Within the iRBD group, 11 individuals did not have visible movements during REM sleep.\n\nAccording to results, individuals with iRBD demonstrated an increased amount of movements (56.3 vs. 41.8 per hour; average movement duration, 3.4 vs. 4.2 seconds) and immobility periods, compared with controls.\n\nThe accuracy for distinguishing iRBD from other sleep disorders ranged from 84.9% to 87.2%, with the highest accuracy (91.9%) achieved when combining all five movement features and analyzing only short movements. Of 11 patients with iRBD without visible movements during REM sleep, seven were correctly identified.\n\n\u201cThis automated approach could be integrated into clinical workflow during the interpretation of sleep tests to enhance and facilitate diagnosis, and avoid missed diagnoses,\u201d During said in a related Mount Sinai press release. \u201cThis method could also be used to inform treatment decisions based on the severity of movements displayed during the sleep tests and, ultimately, help doctors personalize care plans for individual patients.\u201d\n\nReference:"

By signing, the US joins 120 countries working together to protect students, teachers, and schools from violent attacks.\n\nAttacks on schools occur in almost every armed conflict around the world. Each year, thousands of students and teachers are killed and injured, schools destroyed, and children denied the future only education brings.\n\nBy signing the declaration, countries promise to investigate and prosecute attacks that violate the laws of war, help victims, try to continue education during wartime, restore access after attacks, and protect schools from military use.\n\nIn the decade since the declaration was first launched, more than a dozen countries have revised their military guidance to ensure more protection for schools and education. Several have prosecuted people responsible for attacking schools. UN peacekeepers have stopped deploying in schools.\n\nUS policy already supports the declaration\u2019s key elements \u2013 for example, the US military includes schools in its official \u201cno strike\u201d lists, recognizing that schools not being used for military purposes are protected civilian property under the laws of war.\n\nSigning the declaration puts the US on the right side of a global movement its main military allies have already joined. Given its influence, the US move could help expand the group of countries putting their political muscle behind children and their education, encouraging allies, such as Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea to join. Signing better allows the US to use the declaration\u2019s guidance, written by military officers, to urge other countries to respect the laws of war, including when it trains other militaries. Protecting schools globally also protects the US\u2019 significant investments in international education before, during, and after conflict.\n\nThe US signing of the declaration couldn\u2019t be more timely or relevant. In the past year, almost every school in Gaza has been damaged or destroyed. Since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, more than 3,790 educational facilities have been damaged or destroyed. Countries that have not yet endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration should move quickly to do so, and show that schools, teachers, and students are off-limits in times of war."

            "article_content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 After more than a year of painstaking negotiations, Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to a ceasefire deal in the Gaza Strip that, if implemented, could see nearly three dozen Israeli hostages reunited with their families and give hungry and displaced Palestinians a reprieve from months of violence.\n\nIsrael\u2019s government still needs to formally approve the deal, in a vote officials say will take place Thursday morning. But the agreement could mark a first step toward ending a 15-month war that has destroyed Gaza and divided Israelis.\n\nThe truce, mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar, would begin on Sunday and cover an initial period of 42 days.\n\nPalestinians in Khan Younis celebrated the announcement of a ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas. (Video: Reuters)\n\n\u201cThis is one of the toughest negotiations I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d President Joe Biden said Wednesday in remarks from the White House. \u201cAnd I\u2019m deeply satisfied this day has come \u2026 for the sake of the people of Israel and the families waiting in agony, and for the sake of the innocent people in Gaza who suffered unimaginable devastation because of the war.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nplay Play now NaN min Follow on Podcast episode Spotify Apple Google Amazon\n\nUnder the first six-week phase of what mediators hope will evolve into a three-stage process for peace, 33 of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza \u2014 mainly women, children, the elderly and wounded \u2014 will be released from Hamas captivity in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli detention, in a carefully choreographed sequence that will involve humanitarian groups and coordination between Hamas, Egypt and Israel.\n\nAmong the 33 captives slated for release are Americans Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen, said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the White House.\n\nDekel-Chen was wounded in the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and Siegel, 65, will be freed because of his age. A third U.S. citizen, Edan Alexander, was abducted near Gaza while serving in the Israeli military and won\u2019t be released until the second phase of the ceasefire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHamas agreed to release five female Israeli soldiers in the first phase. The remains of at least four more Americans are also still in Gaza. \u201cWe are committed to getting the remains out,\u201d the official said.\n\nIsrael and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal on Jan. 15, following more than 15 months of devastating war. (Video: Joe Snell/The Washington Post)\n\nIsrael will withdraw troops from some parts of Gaza and allow a surge of humanitarian aid into the enclave, where 90 percent of the population, or 1.9 million people, are displaced in squalid conditions with little food, water or shelter from the cold.\n\nDuring the first phase, the volume of aid entering Gaza is supposed to reach more than 500 trucks per day, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday \u2014 a more than sixfold increase over the average number in December.\n\nBut even once the bombs stop falling, steep challenges will remain in getting lifesaving assistance to civilians who need it, including abiding lawlessness in Gaza, destroyed roads and onerous Israeli inspection processes for cargoes entering the territory, aid workers say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a moment of hope and opportunity, but we should be under no illusions how tough it will still be to get support to survivors,\u201d U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Tom Fletcher said in a statement. \u201cThe stakes could not be higher.\u201d\n\nMohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar\u2019s prime minister and foreign affairs minister, spoke on Jan. 15, as Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire. (Video: Reuters)\n\nIsraeli forces will remain in a buffer zone along Gaza\u2019s borders, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in a news conference in Doha, where negotiators spent the last few days hammering out the deal. After a week, if the truce holds, Palestinian civilians sheltering in southern and central Gaza will be allowed to return to the north, which in recent months has been decimated by intense Israeli bombardment and clashes with Hamas militants.\n\nSince October, Israeli forces have besieged the northernmost part of the enclave, blocking most aid and forcing thousands of residents to evacuate. Israel divided the territory into a north and south with a line of fortified checkpoints known as the Netzarim Corridor just outside Gaza City, only occasionally allowing humanitarians to cross into northern areas.\n\nNegotiations for Phase 2 of the deal \u2014 during which the remaining living hostages would be released and Israel would withdraw completely from Gaza \u2014 are supposed to begin in the coming weeks. During Phase 3, Hamas would return the bodies of hostages who were killed and the reconstruction of Gaza would get underway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe deal has offered a glimmer of hope in a conflict that has taken an immense human toll: Israeli attacks have killed more than 46,700 people in Gaza and injured more than 110,200, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates that about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, including more than 300 soldiers. It says 405 soldiers have been killed in its military operation in Gaza.\n\nA war that began with Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel spiraled into a regional conflagration, marked by more than a year of exchanges of fire between Israel and its allies and Iran-aligned groups in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria.\n\nThere was still much that could go wrong during the deal\u2019s implementation, and Israeli officials have emphasized that so far, it is a temporary pause. The thorniest questions \u2014 including who will govern and secure Gaza \u2014 remain unresolved, and negotiations over these and other issues are expected to begin later in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael\u2019s bombardment of Gaza hasn\u2019t let up: At least 19 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes across the territory on Wednesday night after the ceasefire was announced.\n\nStill, even before mediator Qatar declared that a deal was reached, celebrations broke out in Gaza and among hostage families and supporters in Tel Aviv.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office issued a statement shortly after the announcement insisting that some details still needed to be worked out. But President-elect Donald Trump had already blasted out the news to the world, writing on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cWE HAVE A DEAL FOR THE HOSTAGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THEY WILL BE RELEASED SHORTLY. THANK YOU!\u201d\n\nLate Wednesday night, the parties were still arguing over the names of high-profile prisoners to be released under the agreement, according to an official familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s cabinet and members of his coalition government must vote on Thursday morning to approve the deal. His far-right allies in government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, both slammed the agreement as a bad deal that spares Hamas and threatened to withdraw from Netanyahu\u2019s government.\n\nStill, the prime minister is widely expected to have enough votes to push through the agreement, and Israel\u2019s Supreme Court is expected to dismiss possible legal challenges to the deal.\n\n\u201cThis is an important move. This is a necessary move,\u201d Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in televised remarks Wednesday night, urging the government to make the ceasefire official. \u201cThere is no greater moral, human, Jewish, or Israeli obligation than to bring our sons and daughters back to us \u2014 whether to recover at home, or to be laid to rest.\u201d\n\nLeaders from mediating countries appeared to dismiss the procedural steps in Israel as mere formalities. Qatar\u2019s Mohammed, Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi each declared victory after months of stop-and-start negotiations that repeatedly saw negotiators and intelligence chiefs huddle in Middle Eastern capitals, only to return home empty-handed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was no other way for this war to end than with a hostage deal,\u201d Biden said Wednesday. \u201cToo many innocent people have died. Too many communities have been destroyed.\u201d\n\nThe mediators, at least for now, overcame the herculean task of reconciling the diametrically opposed positions of Israel and Hamas. Israel wanted to continue the fighting after a temporary pause and hostage-for-prisoner exchange, while Hamas insisted on a permanent end to the war before it would surrender any captives.\n\nBut pressure on both parties pushed them to close the gap. Netanyahu was under fire from hostage families and those who lost loved ones in the war. He was also in potential legal peril abroad, after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIn Gaza, Hamas was severely weakened after Israel killed its top leaders and kneecapped regional allies. Residents grew increasingly angry as they struggled to survive the punishing campaign Israel launched in response to the Hamas attacks.\n\nIn the end, the deal agreed to Wednesday aligns to a large extent with the phased approach Biden proposed in May: An initial pause in hostilities and release of hostages is intended to lead to \u201csustainable calm,\u201d according to a joint statement by Qatar, Egypt and the United States. Those three countries are meant to serve as guarantors of the deal, and Mohammed said a monitoring body would be established in Cairo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden and Trump each claimed credit for a diplomatic achievement closed through rare foreign-policy collaboration between the outgoing and incoming administrations. As Biden officials carried out the formal diplomacy, Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, met with Netanyahu over the weekend to pressure the Israeli prime minister to agree to a deal before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\n\u201cThis EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nBiden said \u201cthis deal was developed and negotiated under my administration\u201d but that his officials had been speaking \u201cas one team\u201d with their soon-to-be successors in recent days.\n\nHamas leader Khalil al-Hayya hailed the ceasefire as a triumph for the militant group: \u201cToday we prove that the occupation will never defeat our people and their resistance,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHospitals in Israel are preparing to receive hostages who may be malnourished, injured or ill \u2014 and will certainly be traumatized, Israeli media reported.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, where thousands have gathered for months each Saturday night to protest the government\u2019s failure to bring all of the hostages home sooner, crowds beat drums and chanted.\n\n\u201cI hope it will not just be a ceasefire but a stop to the war,\u201d said Benjamin Terem, 65, from Tel Aviv. \u201cWe cannot stay in this situation.\u201d\n\nIn Gaza, 20-year-old Farah Hathout said she was displaced nine times throughout the war. She woke up where she is sheltering in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, to check the news.\n\n\u201cIs it real? Have they signed?\u201d she said she asked herself.\n\n\u201cI pray it goes through,\u201d said Hathout, who was in tears. \u201cMay God compensate us for what we experienced.\u201d\n\nDeYoung reported from Washington, Shih from Jerusalem, Balousha from Toronto and Mahfouz from Cairo.

            "article_content": "S&P 500 fell 3% since December 6, but market internals show deeper damage.\n\nOnly 19% of S&P 500 stocks have risen since the market's peak, with most down 5% or more in that time.\n\nMarket breadth measures warn of potential weakness, but some experts see a buying opportunity.\n\nThe S&P 500's decline since its record high on December 6 is nothing unusual. The index was down 3% through Thursday.\n\nBut underneath the surface, a lot of damage has been done to the internals of the S&P 500, making the paltry decline more painful for investors.\n\nSince December 6, just 19% of stocks within the S&P 500 posted a positive return through Tuesday. More than half of the index's underlying stocks posted a negative return of at least 5%, and about 20% of the index posted losses of nearly 10% or more.\n\nSome of the worst-performing stocks during this time period include Chipotle, down 11%; Palo Alto Networks, down 12%; and Adobe, down 23%.\n\nOther technical indicators have showcased most stocks' overwhelmingly negative trading environment over the past six weeks.\n\nOne popular technical breadth measure, the percentage of S&P 500 stocks above their 200-day moving averages, plunged from about 75% on December 6 to as low as 50% on Monday, hitting its lowest level since November 2023.\n\nLPL Financial\n\nAccording to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, the 25 percentage point plunge in the popular market breadth measure, coinciding with just a 4% drop in the S&P 500 index, is a warning sign for investors, at least in the short term.\n\n\"This divergence between price and breadth implies fewer and fewer stocks participated in the post-Election Day breakout to new highs,\" Turnquist said in a note on Monday. \"While these deviations can persist for extended periods, they often foreshadow building vulnerabilities of a rally susceptible to stalling.\"\n\nTurnquist warned that if the percentage of S&P 500 stocks above their 200-day moving average dips below 48%, future returns could be weak, with average 12-month forward returns at -7.3% when that happens based on historical data.\n\nTurnquist highlighted the S&P 500's rising 200-day moving average at about 5,585 as a logical area of support for the index. A move to that level would represent further downside of 6% from current levels and a peak-to-trough decline of about 8%.\n\nAnother measure of the deterioration in market breadth is the equal-weighted S&P 500 index, which has declined as much as 7% since December 6, nearly double the S&P 500's decline over the same time period.\n\nDan Greenhaus, chief strategist at Solus Alternative Asset Management, highlighted the breadth divergence in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday.\n\n\"There's been huge drops in some of these stocks. AMD, Micron down 30%, 40%, 50% from their highs,\" Greenhaus said. \"You're doing a disservice by looking merely at the headline and saying, 'well, stocks are down 3%, 4%, 5% from the highs.' I think that obviously misses the larger story.\"\n\nUltimately, as damaging as the recent sell-off has been to the stock market's internals, Turnquist sees it as a buying opportunity for investors, even if it continues to trend lower.\n\n\"The silver lining to a deeper drawdown is that it could provide a buying opportunity back into this bull market, as most importantly, the S&P 500 remains above its longer-term uptrend, and fundamentals are on solid footing,\" Turnquist said.\n\nGreenhaus agrees, telling CNBC that specifically for the growing AI story and broader technology sector, as long as the fundamentals stay strong, putting money to work at these levels makes sense.\n\n\"If you believe that a lot of those stories remain intact, then this is a tremendous buying opportunity,\" Greenhaus said."

            "article_content": "Senators on Thursday pressed some of President-elect Donald Trump's top Cabinet picks on his central campaign promises, critical natural disaster relief and more.\n\nInterior secretary nominee Doug Burgum, proposed Environmental Protection Agency director Lee Zeldin, Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent and Housing secretary nominee Scott Turner all went before lawmakers. After fiery faceoffs earlier in the week, they were asked in calmer hearings about the nation's economy and readiness for natural disasters.\n\nBessent would be Trump\u2019s point person on GOP priorities such as tax cuts and tariffs. Meanwhile, Burgum and Zeldin would both have sway over the Trump administration's energy policy, a cornerstone of the president-elect's reelection bid.\n\nHere are USA TODAY's top takeaways from the hearings.\n\nMore:Takeaways from Senate confirmation hearings: Democrats grill Trump Cabinet nominee\n\nBipartisan concerns about tariffs\n\nTrump often talks about implementing tariffs on foreign goods, deploying them during his first term and promising more in a second administration.\n\n\u201cThe word tariff, properly used, is a beautiful word - one of the most beautiful words I've ever heard,\u201d Trump told a crowd of Georgia supporters in September. \u201cIt's music to my ears.\u201d\n\nBessent, a prominent hedge fund manager, said Americans should think about tariffs in three ways under Trump: A negotiating tactic, a tool to remedy \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d and a way to raise revenue.\n\nBut some lawmakers are nervous about mores tariffs.\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., told Bessent that tariffs on Canadian goods could strike the economy in his New England state.\n\n\u201cWhat reassurance can we get from the Trump administration that there\u2019s going to be a do-no-harm policy to American consumers and Vermont workers and small businesses with a tariff policy?\u201d Welch asked.\n\nBessent argued Trump is sensitive to the needs of \"working America,\" but he admitted to lawmakers it's \u201cvery difficult for me to isolate Vermont especially.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., raised concerns about the impact of tariffs on U.S. farmers\n\n\u201cOveruse of tariffs can inflate costs and provoke trade retaliation,\u201d Young told Bessent. \u201cAs Hoosier farmers have experienced first hand over the years, they often bare the impact.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s plans to impose massive tariffs and deport millions of immigrants who lack permanent legal status are likely to reignite inflation and dampen economic growth, according to forecasters.\n\nYet his pledge to extend and expand the sweeping tax cuts passed in his first term and ease the regulatory burden on businesses could juice the economy and have mixed effects on inflation.\n\nClimate questions\n\nTrump has promised to expand oil production in the U.S., and he'll lean on Burgum to help. The former North Dakota governor told senators he believes America has reached an energy crisis, but he also believes climate change exists.\n\nRepublicans like West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, who owns a coal mining business, told Burgum energy is \u201ca key that opens every door.\u201d\n\nDemocrats like Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, pointed to testimonies previously given by former Secretaries of Defense James Mattis and Chuck Hagel. They said climate change is a national security threat that affects areas where troops are stationed.\n\nMore:'When can he start?': Trump allies bullish on Cabinet nominees getting confirmed\n\n\u201cWithin fossil fuels, the concern has been about emissions, and within emissions, we have the technology to do things like carbon capture to eliminate harmful emission,\u201d Burgum said.\n\nMore:What is carbon capture and how does it work? Inside the process that could slow global warming\n\n\u201cYou have military leaders who acknowledge that climate change is a major issue,\" Hirono shot back. \"For you to take the position that you're going to engage in active actions that will result in the burden of burning more fossil fuel, it's troubling.\"\n\nZeldin was also questioned about climate change.\n\n\u201cDo you agree with President-elect Trump that climate change is a hoax?\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asked.\n\nZeldin replied that he believes climate change is real, before defending his potential future boss.\n\n\u201cAs far as President Trump goes, the context that I have heard him speak about it was with a criticism of policies that have been enacted because of climate change,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cAnd I think that he\u2019s concerned about the economic costs of some policies where there\u2019s a debate and a difference of opinion between parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would respectfully disagree with you,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nWildfire control \u2018very key\u2019\n\nCalifornia wildfires have left 25 dead and thousands of schools, businesses and other structures destroyed in the Greater Los Angeles area. Lawmakers asked Trump's nominees about the blazes during Thursday's hearings.\n\nSens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., opened their remarks by addressing the fires. Lee directed Burgum that, if he's confirmed, addressing wildfires that shocked Western states should be a \"very key priority\" for the country's future.\n\nElsewhere, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questioned Zeldin on his willingness to advocate for Californians affected by the Los Angeles-area wildfires fires. Trump and certain House Republicans have signaled their interest in placing conditions on disaster aid for California, amid tense relations between the president-elect and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\u201cI assume, Mr. Zeldin, your response will not depend on whether disaster strikes a red state or a blue state, you will equally work to speed relief to those Americans affected?\u201d Schiff asked.\n\n\u201cYes, senator,\u201d Zeldin replied. The potential Trump pick vowed he would \"do everything in my power to be able to assist\" devastated communities.\n\nTax fight preview\n\nTrump\u2019s signature achievement during his first administration was a massive tax cut.\n\nSome of those tax cut provisions expire at the end of 2025. Trump wants to extend them and has promised new cuts, including ending taxes on tipped wages and Social Security payments.\n\nBessent said extending the Trump tax cuts is the single most important economic issue of the day.\n\n\u201cThis is pass- fail, that if we do not fix these tax cuts, if we do not renew and extend, then we will be facing an economic calamity,\u201d he said.\n\nBessent was also asked about everything from increasing the federal minimum wage to capping credit card interest rates and increasing economic sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBessent said he doesn\u2019t support increasing minimum wage nationally. He argued it's a step that should be taken by states instead.\n\nLater, he was open to increasing sanctions on Russia.\n\n\"If any officials in the Russian Federation are watching this confirmation hearing they should know that if I'm confirmed, and if President Trump requests as part of his strategy to end the Ukraine war, that I would be 100% on board for taking sanctions up,\" Bessent said.\n\nContributing: Paul Davidson"

'Big head, big eyes, no mouth. Telepathically speaking, fingers long, dextrous,' she listed.\n\n'If you think about where we're at currently in technology, we sit in front of a screen. We don't speak to each other. We don't have to talk,' she explained.\n\n'And we all know that we\u2019re moving off the planet because now Elon Musk is our president,' she added.\n\n'When we get to Mars, we're really going to end up being like a completely different species,' Diaz continued before explaining that she believes aliens are humans from the future.\n\n'When you told me that, that f***ed me up,' Foxx said.\n\nOver 10 years ago, Diaz and Musk were rumored to be romantically involved after he reportedly gifted her an early Tesla model.\n\n'He's been going to LA so regularly, Musk often arrives without giving his colleagues a heads-up he's in town,' a source told Page Six at the time before adding that the rumored couple had 'gotten close.'\n\nIn a video for Complex released on Wednesday, Diaz had a discussion with her co-star, 57, about aliens and shared her theory, which stunned him. She also surprised the actor when she took a jab at Trump as she referenced an ongoing joke about Musk's outsized influence on his administration\n\nAt one point, the Charlie's Angel alum \u2014 who made her first red carpet appearance in half a decade for the premiere of their new movie in Berlin \u2014 called him President Musk, which prompted a shocked reaction to flash across Foxx's face.

'I don't know where people got that from.'\n\nDiaz and Foxx star as former CIA spies Emily and Matt in the upcoming Netflix movie Back in Action.\n\nPer the synopsis, the elite spies 'jump back into the world of espionage' over a decade after vanishing from the CIA to start a family when their secret identities are exposed.\n\nThe movie also stars Glenn Close, Tom Brittney, Kyle Chandler, Leela Owen and more.\n\nBack in Action premieres on Netflix and will be available to stream on Friday, January 17."

            "article_content": "\u201cL\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi\u201d is a phrase attributed to French king Louis XIV, the Sun King, though it is considered by historians to be apocryphal: meaning \u201cI am the state,\u201d it speaks to the king\u2019s absolute and divinely ordained power. Three kings ruled from the Palace of Versailles: Louis XIV until his death in 1715, then Louis XV from 1722 until 1774 and finally, Louis XVI until the Revolution of 1789. Louis XV was among the best-educated royals of his age, and his knowledge was of a mostly scientific nature. From the age of seven, he was passionate about cartography, and at age eleven, he discovered astronomy. \u201cIn addition to his core education, he touched upon anatomy and surgery, and from medicine, he went on to study botany. He read a great deal, assiduously consulted the maps in his geography gallery, attended dissections, studied plants at Trianon [a smaller building at Versailles] and observed the heavens, following every astronomical event,\u201d writes French art historian Beatrix Saule in the book that accompanies the London Science Museum\u2019s exhibition, \u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour.\u201d While Versailles and its kings have always been regarded as sumptuous and somewhat decadent against a backdrop of the then-starving French peasantry, the scientific pursuits of the kings are not at the top of public consciousness. Until, that is, this show was put together.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

I was surprised, therefore, that the revolution was mentioned only briefly in this exhibition: while it is written on plaques that scientific instruments were destroyed or stolen during the riots, it is not explained at length, nor is it explained fully as to whether the republic that followed adopted the scientific discoveries of their forebears. This, I feel, is a glaring omission, and one that will leave visitors wanting to know more: while the exhibition book mentions that \u201cdocuments and scientific instruments were scattered at the time of the revolutionary sales in 1793-94, when Versailles was emptied of all its furnishings\u201d and that objects were taken to various institutions, it does not feel thorough. True, the exhibition is entitled \u201cVersailles\u201d rather than \u201cFrance: Science and Splendour,\u201d but more background wouldn\u2019t be out of place.\n\nThe star of the show is Louis XV\u2019s rhino. The male Indian rhinoceros presented to Louis XV in 1769 by Jean-Baptiste Chevalier de Conan, the governor of Chandernagore (now Chandannagar) in Bengal, has pride of place in the exhibition\u2019s main room. The plaque reads that he was killed during the revolution, possibly drowning in the fountains or after being stabbed with a sword. While he lived, the rhinoceros was among thousands of animals from Europe, Asia, Africa and America in the royal menagerie. They were a source of inspiration for many artists, such as the Flemish animal painter Pieter Boel, whose studies included a painting of one of the rarest birds in the menagerie, the cassowary, sent to Versailles in 1671 from Madagascar.\n\nThe other star of the show is the Clock of the Creation of the World (the Pendule de la Cr\u00e9ation du monde). At the time of its manufacture\u20141754\u2014clocks were considered to be the most sophisticated and most prestigious devices ever made. Its design and mechanisms are a spectacle to behold: at the top, a shining sun banishes the darkness, which is represented in the form of clouds. It really is marvelous to look at: like jewelry, it gleams brilliantly in the light, and the meteorological forms are very stunningly depicted. \u201cIn the lower part, held in a patinated bronze rock surrounded by raging waves, sits a terrestrial globe engraved with the different countries. This globe rotates on its axis in 24 hours, and the inclination of the poles varies according to the seasons. A long ray of sun indicates midday in the countries situated on the same latitude,\u201d the exhibition book explains further.\n\nA portrait of Emilie du Ch\u00e2telet (1706\u20131749) is also included in the exhibition\u2014she who was deemed by her lover Voltaire to be \u201ca great man whose only fault was being a woman.\u201d While living with and supporting the writer financially, she accumulated a very large library, carried out scientific experiments and wrote a great number of books. One of the first to appear, in 1738, was El\u00e9mens de la philosophie de Neuton (translated colloquially, A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Newtonianism), which was thought to be by Voltaire but was, in fact, a collaborative effort. In addition to her literal translation of Newton\u2019s prose, du Ch\u00e2telet provided more accessible explanations of his arguments with clear examples: \u201cShe transformed his geometrical expositions into modern calculus, and also summarised the latest mathematical research and experimental vindications of his theories,\u201d says Versailles: Science and Splendour. I would have liked to have some space dedicated to the position of women in France at the time. Of the scientific community, how many were women? What level of education could a middle- or working-class woman attain? Sadly, this wider context is missing.\n\nThe construction of the magnificent fountains at Versailles, which still function gloriously today, is given space. The plans for the mechanisms and piping that would deliver the requisite 9,500 cubic meters of water , composed by \u201csavants and engineers,\u201d along with the taxidermied rhinoceros and the Clock of the Creation of the World, really give the exhibition its splendor. That said, if I had the chance to curate such a show, I would dedicate one of the galleries to a reproduction of a palace room of Versailles, complete with paneled walls, gilding and paintings. The objects in the exhibition, though fascinating, are rendered a little clinical in their austere Science Museum settings. Nevertheless, the show is a tremendous feat and sure to spark curiosity in those who make the time to visit.\n\n\u201cVersailles: Science and Splendour\u201d is at London\u2019s Science Museum through April 21, 2025."
