        "source": "Arizona Daily Star",
        "article_content": "Arizona changed its play-calling operation heading into the Utah game, and the initial results were positive. Well, somewhat positive.\n\nThe Wildcats upset the 10th-ranked Utes in Salt Lake City after Matt Adkins swapped roles with Dino Babers. Arizona scored 23 points after managing just seven against Kansas State (and only 20 via the offense vs. NAU).\n\nThe offense looked different in some ways, including the use of motion and more targets for tight end Keyan Burnett.\n\nBut when you dig into the numbers \u2014 our ongoing mission at \u201cCats Stats\u201d headquarters \u2014 it largely looks the same.\n\nWith a matchup on tap against Texas Tech \u2014 the polar opposite of Utah on defense \u2014 we\u2019ll examine the state of the UA offense. Where did the Wildcats show promise in Salt Lake City? Where can they still improve?\n\nWhat we liked\n\nBurnett\u2019s breakout is a good place to start. The junior caught five passes for 76 yards and a touchdown \u2014 all career bests.\n\nWe have no way of knowing whether Burnett was the first read on any of those plays. But we do know that he was targeted six times \u2014 one more than in either of the previous two seasons. His previous high for a game was three (Oct. 8, 2022, vs. Oregon).\n\nTetairoa McMillan again had a monster target share at 42.3%, while Burnett was at 23.1%. For the season, McMillan is sitting at 37.6%; four of his teammates, including Burnett, are tied for second at 9.4%.\n\nThe more Arizona can spread the ball around, the more effective its offense will be. It\u2019ll also take pressure off McMillan, who\u2019s been visibly frustrated at times during games.\n\nThe Wildcats also tweaked their running back rotation, resulting in a more balanced distribution of carries. Quali Conley had 14 rushing attempts to Kedrick Reescano\u2019s seven. In the two previous games, Conley had 31 carries while Reescano had only eight.\n\nReescano was a force with the ball in his hands vs. Utah, gaining 73 yards and averaging 10.4 yards per attempt. His combination of size and speed and his downhill running style complement Conley\u2019s craftiness well; we wouldn\u2019t mind seeing a 50/50 split moving forward. (In Week 1, when the two main backs were Jacory Croskey-Merritt and Conley, it was closer to that \u2014 13 carries for Croskey-Merritt, 10 for Conley.)\n\nAnother encouraging sign: Per Pro Football Focus, QB Noah Fifita\u2019s average time to throw (TTT) dropped to 3.09 seconds after it had been on a steady ascent. That number \u2014 which shows how long a quarterback holds the ball before throwing \u2014 had gone from 2.69 seconds to 3.25 to 3.44 in Arizona\u2019s first three games. Fifita still has the second-highest TTT in the Big 12 at 3.15 seconds.\n\nFifita has the second-lowest pressure-to-sack rate (P2S%) at 5.8%, according to PFF. He did not suffer a sack against the Utes despite being pressured 17 times.\n\nFifita has improved dramatically when it comes to avoiding sacks. His P2S% last year was 17.5%.\n\nWhat's still concerning\n\nArizona\u2019s offense has been boom-or-bust this season, and that trend continued at Utah.\n\nThe Wildcats converted only 4 of 13 third downs (30.8%), and their average to gain was 8.6 yards. Six of those 13 attempts required 9 or more yards, while only two were of the third-and-short variety (4 yards or less).\n\n\u201cThe important part with that is hopefully being more efficient on first and second down so that you're not in those big third-down situations,\u201d UA coach Brent Brennan said, adding that it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to put the offense in better positions.\n\nArizona has been overly reliant on big plays. The Wildcats had three pass plays of 15-plus yards and six run plays of 10-plus yards vs. the Utes. Those nine plays accounted for 227 yards (25.2 yards per play). The other 52 plays netted just 131 yards (2.5).\n\nThe New Mexico and NAU games followed a similar pattern.\n\nArizona had 17 \u201cbig plays\u201d vs. the Lobos for 516 yards (30.4 ypp). The other 40 produced 111 yards (2.8).\n\nThe Wildcats had nine big plays vs. the Lumberjacks for 232 yards (25.8 ypp). The other 46 gained just 129 yards (2.8).\n\nBig plays are desirable, of course. But there\u2019s something to be said for positive gains that create manageable conversions.\n\nFour more sets of stats illustrate the all-or-nothing nature of Arizona\u2019s offense:\n\n\u2022 Arizona is tied for 85th nationally with 59 plays of 10-plus yards, per CFBStats.com. They\u2019re tied for 47th in plays of 20-plus yards (23), tied for 25th in plays of 30-plus (13), tied for 22nd in plays of 40-plus (seven) and tied for eighth in plays of 50-plus (five). See a trend there?\n\n\u2022 The Wildcats ran 61 plays at Utah, tying their season high. They have run 234 offensive plays overall, fewest in the Big 12. They\u2019re 15th in the 16-team league in plays per game at 58.5, just ahead of Houston, which has the worst offense in the conference by any measure.\n\nThe Cougars average a league-low 4.9 yards per play. The Wildcats, meanwhile, are one of only three teams in the conference to average more than 7 yards per play.\n\n\u2022 Arizona had 17 first downs vs. Utah. The Wildcats rank next to last in the Big 12 in first downs per game at 18.3. (Houston is last at 14.2). The 2023 Cats averaged 23.2 first downs per game, third most in the Pac-12.\n\n\u2022 Arizona made two trips to the red zone against Utah \u2014 consistent with its season average. The Wildcats have had only eight red-zone opportunities this season, again ranking ahead of only the Cougars (seven) in the Big 12.\n\nArizona averaged 4.4 red-zone trips last season. Texas Tech has a league-high 26, or 5.2 per game, so far this season.\n\nThe caveat to all of this is that Utah has one of the best defenses in the Big 12. The Wildcats should be able to move the ball more consistently against the Red Raiders, who don\u2019t.\n\nWe\u2019ll be monitoring how Arizona moves the ball Saturday night. Fifita didn\u2019t have a single pass attempt with 10-19 air yards vs. Utah, per PFF. The Wildcats need to make the Red Raiders \u2014 and all future opponents \u2014 defend all parts of the field. The Cats need to be more incremental, which will make them more efficient.\n\nThe PFF report \u2014 Arizona vs. Utah Each week throughout the season, we\u2019ll share data compiled by our colleagues at Pro Football Focus, who grade every snap taken by every player across college football.

        "article_content": "\u00d7\n\nMilford to hold talks, signings in Durango and Farmington\n\nRetired Navajo Ranger Stanley Milford Jr. has seen some things in his life that can\u2019t always be explained.\n\n\u00d7\n\nMilford, who split his time growing up between his mother\u2019s house in Oklahoma and with his father on the Navajo Reservation, said not only was his upbringing between two different geographic areas, the two were culturally different as well: Oklahoma was more \u201cmainstream and Western\u201d while the reservation was steeped in \u201cNative American culture.\u201d\n\nWhen he grew up, he graduated from the United States Indian Police Academy and became a Navajo Ranger, where he and his partner, Jonathan Dover, investigated paranormal cases called in by residents. For those who have been in the area a while, he also cut his teeth in law enforcement by helping during the 1998 Four Corners manhunt for the three men \u2013 Jason McVean, Robert Mason and Alan \u201cMonte\u201d Pilon \u2013 who killed Cortez Police Officer Dale Claxton and took off into the Colorado/Utah desert.\n\nHe\u2019s just released his memoir, \u201cThe Paranormal Ranger,\u201d and will be at Maria\u2019s Bookshop and in Farmington to discuss it. He\u2019s also been featured on shows, including Nexflix\u2019s reboot of \u201cUnsolved Mysteries.\u201d\n\nIf you go WHAT: Author Event and Book-Signing With Stanley Milford Jr. and his new release, \u201cThe Paranormal Ranger.\u201d WHEN: 6-8 p.m. Oct. 10. WHERE: Maria\u2019s Bookshop, 960 Main Ave. MORE INFORMATION: Visit https://tinyurl.com/y67bn8sx.\n\nThe memoir is a mix of Milford\u2019s autobiography interspersed with chapters about the Navajo origin story.\n\nMilford and Dover first got into paranormal investigations when they were called to take over the case of a Navajo grandmother, who lost a sheep.\n\n\u201cShe recounted this story of this Bigfoot stepping over into her sheep corral and taking off with one of her sheep,\u201d he said. \u201cShe called the department, and two Rangers were assigned, and one of the Rangers was a comedian; he\u2019s just constantly joking and laughing and carrying on. It\u2019s just his personality, but I think the grandmother was probably offended by that, and she contacted the chief ranger and probably chewed him out.\u201d\n\nBecause of her call, the chief called a department meeting, and told everyone that no matter how strange a case may seem, it\u2019s real to the person making the call, and every case was to be investigated as such, even if responding officers didn\u2019t believe it. And then, Milford said, the chief looked over at him and Dover and said they were going to oversee these cases and manage them.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s how it happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as us being assigned to it, we weren\u2019t sitting over there raising our hands to be the Navajo \u2018X Files\u2019 or whatever. That wasn\u2019t the case. We were assigned to do it, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nMilford said the idea to include the origin story into his memoir was inspired by a case in 2009 of a haunting he investigated in Window Rock, Arizona.\n\n\u201cIt was an office space, and the director had said \u2018my staff are experiencing all kinds of what they\u2019re describing as paranormal phenomena.\u2019 She approached the chief ranger at the time and asked if he had anybody that could come in and validate any of the stuff that they were claiming,\u201d he said. \u201cI put together a team of four individuals. We went in on two nights, and one of the prominent things about that case was coins would materialize and fall out of nothingness, out of thin air.\u201d\n\nAnd even after all this time, he said the coins appearing followed him: \u201cLast month, I had the most coins that I\u2019ve ever experienced ... this phenomenon still happens to me to this very day. Witnessing that with your own eyes, it really changes your worldview.\n\n\u201cIt made me realize that, like with the Navajo, in their creation story, they talk about this idea of coming through these different worlds into the physical world that we\u2019re in right now. Some of them describe either four worlds or five worlds, depending on the version of it. It got me thinking that, like with these coins, these coins are manifesting in our physical world from somewhere else. It got me to thinking about string theory and the idea of other planes of existence or dimensions.\u201d\n\nMilford said he starting thinking even further about different paranormal phenomenon that people refer to, \u201clike Bigfoot and UFOs and extraterrestrials, even the witchcraft, even the skinwalkers and things like that. I think they use the these other dimensions coming and going into our physical world from these other dimensions. That\u2019s how we experience it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn and I lived in the woods at times, being Navajo Rangers right in the heavily forested high mountain areas, and we did not find the evidence that supports these things live out there,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou can find all of that with bears, mountain lions, cougars, coyotes and everything that lives out there. You can see where it beds down. You can see where it goes out and hunts and drinks. You can find all of that evidence of that ... but the thing with the Bigfoot, you don\u2019t see all of that evidence, although twice I\u2019ve witnessed this thing that people refer to as Bigfoot. And so I know that these things do happen, and they do exist. So it could interdimensional.\u201d\n\nAnd while he\u2019s had his share of people who don\u2019t believe in what he\u2019s seen and believes, Milford said the key is to be open-minded.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always going to have people that are going to take the opposite 180 view from what you\u2019re talking about, and I understand that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the message that John and I are conveying out there is much more important than listening to those people that are going to put it down. And John and I are open minded; we were very open minded. I remember one time we presented in Dulce, New Mexico, at one other UFO thing. There was an elderly Native woman that came up to us. She was in her mid 80s, and she came up to us with tears in her eyes and hugged us after we did our presentation. She said, \u2018Thank you for doing what you do.\u2019 She went on to convey a story about when she was a young girl encountering her UFO and her family members are standing around her with their jaws wide open because she never, ever shared that experience with them. I think, out of fear of being ridiculed or shunned, or whatever it might be, she never shared that experience. She thanked us and she said, you\u2019re giving people that have these experiences more or less a forum to be able to come together and share these experiences with like-minded people that are willing to listen.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s really, ultimately what the book is: to let people know that these experiences do happen, and to be respectful of others that do have these experiences, and letting people know these people aren\u2019t crazy, and they\u2019re not alone. And I would dare to say worldwide, if you looked at every family on this planet, if you looked in the history of their family, there\u2019s probably somebody within that family that has had some type of so-called supernatural or paranormal experience, whether it\u2019s seeing UFOs and lights in the sky or hauntings. I think it\u2019s much more common than we could ever imagine.\u201d\n\nkatie@durangoherald.com"

        "article_content": "Polygon\u2019s Editor\u2019s Letter is a column from Editor-in-Chief Chris Plante that reflects on the video game and entertainment industries, their communities, and Polygon itself. New editions appear in the first week of each month.\n\nLast month, I wrote about how the endless stream of \u201ctoo many games\u201d has caused existential problems for game makers. This month, I\u2019ll focus on the other side of the equation: the audience. The people who play all of these new games. Or, as a recent survey tells us, the people who don\u2019t play them.\n\nAbundance should be a boon for the average video game fan. Unfettered competition pushes prices down, particularly on PC, where each month players can grab bundles containing dozens (sometimes hundreds) of games for less than $20. And even the fanciest, freshest games often get discounted within weeks of launch.\n\nBetter still, as creators seek untouched corners of the market, their target audiences can be more varied. Wish to build a cozy castle diorama? Want a hardcore SWAT simulator or an anime Stardew Valley-like? Crave an ode to Brazilian bootleg boomer shooters of the 1990s built on actual 1990s tech? If you have an itch, odds are it can be scratched.\n\nAnd yet, a diminutive portion of the overall gaming audience plays new games. According to a report from Newzoo, in 2023 players spent 77% of their playtime on games three years or older. Much of the time players spent on new games went to annualized franchises, like Call of Duty, Madden, and EA FC. A paltry 8% of overall playtime in 2023 went to new games not tied to big, yearly IP.\n\nIn 2024, when someone sits down to play a video game, they can either spend money on a promising but unknown new game, or they can choose from their massive backlog of owned games. Or, they might return to a live-service game like League of Legends or Fortnite that continues to provide a familiar dopamine surge week after week, year after year. To play a new game is to willingly take a risk in terms of one\u2019s money, time, and happiness.\n\nThus, we have 8% of total playtime going toward new games: a tiny slice of pie from which the thousands of developers each year fight for a bite. Ryan Rigney, gaming comms veteran and author of the illuminating Push to Talk newsletter, has been digging into this problem (and this unsettling data) for the past few weeks. I strongly recommend you read his piece \u201cAre Old Games Killing New Games?\u201d\n\nIn that newsletter, Rigney uses Arco, his personal favorite game of the year, which at the time of writing this piece has a modest 623 reviews on Steam, as an example of how a truly great game can fall through the cracks. The example hit me like a rock to the forehead. Despite Arco being one of my most anticipated games, despite receiving advance code from a publicist, despite having a weekly video game podcast that requires me to sample dozens of new games a year, I only now have gotten around to playing this game.\n\nAnd frankly, even with everything going for it, Arco could have just as easily collected dust indefinitely on my exponentially elongating to-do list.\n\nHow to enjoy new video games in the Age of Abundance\n\nSlackers - Carts of Glory is one of the many great games of 2024 that you\u2019ve likely never played. Image: Falling Saints\n\nWhat does this mean for you? As the headline promised (or threatened?), you too won\u2019t play many of 2024\u2019s best games. Time is against you. The number of hours can\u2019t fit the surplus of great new releases.\n\nAssuming we all accept that to be true, I thought it might help if I shared some strategies I\u2019ve learned over the years for making the most of my video game time. As someone professionally expected to have a grasp on the vast majority of video games released, plus the entirety of gaming history, I\u2019ve been wrestling with this challenge for some time.\n\nBe mindful of where your gaming time goes: This is my number one tip when people ask me how I play so many games. The answer is that I play the stuff I like, and I skip or bail on the stuff I don\u2019t. For the past decade, major video game publishers have worked tirelessly to create \u201cforever\u201d games that use habit-forming hooks to lock in players indefinitely. If you want to play the same game every day for years on end, that\u2019s fine and your prerogative! Alternatively, if you want to play new games more, then take a break from your \u201cforever\u201d game of choice. You might find, with some distance, it had become a chore rather than a treat.\n\nWatch streams and playthroughs: Ashley Bardhan recently argued that watching a video game isn\u2019t so different from playing it. I agree. This guidance won\u2019t surprise anyone under the age of 30. But many gamers in the millennial demographic (or older) have yet to make a habit of watching streams on Twitch or playthroughs on YouTube. If this is your first time, search for a playthrough of a new game that interests you on YouTube, skim the headlines and thumbnail images for a style that matches your own, and give it a try!\n\nFind communities that match your pace: Similar to watching games, reading about games is a great way to follow games. Just be sure to find a community that moves at your tempo. If you want a trillion messages and the latest info, a game\u2019s official or unofficial Discord can be great. Want the highlights, try a subreddit. And if you prefer to keep up to date on the games community as a whole, rather than one game, I recommend Polygon.com. Naturally.\n\nAccept that you can\u2019t know everything: For the first few decades of video game culture, the most hardcore gamers took pride in having an encyclopedic knowledge of the industry. Not only had they played every game, but they also knew its developer, publisher, and \u2014 if it came from Japan \u2014 the original title and release date. Because game developers of the \u201980s and \u201990s only released so many games, exhaustive knowledge could be cultivated. The NES had 1,377 games. But then the PS4 had 3,399 games. Steam laps both those numbers each year. In 2024, acquiring an all-encompassing knowledge of video games isn\u2019t possible. And the pursuit of it is like trying to catch every fish in the ocean.\n\nImage: Mossmouth via Polygon\n\nBefore I wrap, let\u2019s talk about one more game.\n\nLast month, developer Mossmouth published what Game File author Stephen Totilo wrote \u201cmight be the most 2024 game anyone can play this year.\u201d If you can even call it a game. UFO 50 is a package carrying 50 stand-alone, complete games from some of the most brilliant game designers alive.\n\nUFO 50\u2019s a masterpiece and the vast majority of gamers will never play it. A tiny fraction of those who do will manage to play all 50 games. And an infinitesimal percentage of the people on Earth will finish the game in its entirety.\n\nThe project is a microcosm of the problem that faces players. With so many good games in UFO 50, its players must approach the game as they would the entire video game ecosystem. Be mindful of your time and your priorities. Dabble! Don\u2019t like a game? Drop it! Be comfortable knowing you don\u2019t have to play all 50 games to completion to enjoy UFO 50. In fact, you don\u2019t have to play any of them.\n\nWeeks after its release, fans have come together to solve its mysteries and celebrate their favorite games within the game on Reddit, Twitch, and YouTube. They\u2019ve created lore explainers, role-played within its fictional history, and carried the experience of the game beyond the confines of the software."

Learn More\n\nAs the generative AI continues to progress, having a simple chatbot may no longer be enough for many enterprises.\n\nCloud hyperscalers are racing to build up their databases and tools to help enterprises deploy operational data quickly and efficiently, letting them build applications that are both intelligent and contextually aware.\n\nCase in point: Google Cloud\u2019s recent barrage of updates for multiple database offerings, starting with AlloyDB.\n\nAccording to a blog post from the company, the fully managed PostgreSQL-compatible database now supports ScaNN (scalable nearest neighbor) vector index in general availability. The technology powers its Search and YouTube services and paves the way for faster index creation and vector queries while consuming far less memory.\n\nIn addition, the company also announced a partnership with Aiven for the managed deployment of AlloyDB as well as updates for Memorystore for Valkey and Firebase.\n\nUnderstanding the value of ScaNN for AlloyDB\n\nVector databases are critical to power advanced AI workloads, right from RAG chatbots to recommender systems.\n\nAt the heart of these systems sit key capabilities like storing and managing vector embeddings (numerical representation of data) and conducting similarity searches needed for the targeted applications.\n\nAs most developers in the world prefer PostgreSQL as the go-to operational database, its extension for vector search, pgvector, has become highly popular. Google Cloud already supports it on AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, with a state-of-the-art graph-based algorithm called Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) handling vector jobs.\n\nHowever, on occasions where the vector workload is too large, the performance of the algorithm may decline, leading to application latencies and high memory usage.\n\nTo address this, Google Cloud is making ScaNN vector index in AlloyDB generally available. This new index uses the same technology that powers Google Search and YouTube to deliver up to four times faster vector queries and up to eight-fold faster index build times, with a 3-4x smaller memory footprint than the HNSW index in standard PostgreSQL.\n\n\u201cThe ScaNN index is the first PostgreSQL-compatible index that can scale to support more than one billion vectors while maintaining state-of-the-art query performance \u2014 enabling high-performance workloads for every enterprise,\u201d Andi Gutmans, the GM and VP of engineering for Databases at Google Cloud, wrote in a blog post.\n\nGutmans also announced a partnership with Aiven to make AlloyDB Omni, the downloadable edition of AlloyDB, available as a managed service that runs anywhere, including on-premises or on the cloud.\n\n\u201cYou can now run transactional, analytical, and vector workloads across clouds on a single platform, and easily get started building gen AI applications, also on any cloud. This is the first partnership that adds an administration and management layer for AlloyDB Omni,\u201d he added.\n\nWhat\u2019s new in Memorystore for Valkey and Firebase?\n\nIn addition to AlloyDB, Google Cloud announced enhancements for Memorystore for Valkey, the fully managed cluster for the Valkey in-memory database, and the Firebase application development platform.\n\nFor the Valkey offering, the company said it is adding vector search capabilities. Gutmans noted that a single Memorystore for Valkey instance can now perform similarity search at single-digit millisecond latency on over a billion vectors, with more than 99% recall.\n\nHe also added that the next version of Memorystore for Valkey, 8.0, is now in public preview with 2x faster querying speed as compared to Memorystore for Redist Cluster, a new replication scheme, networking enhancements and detailed visibility into performance and resource usage.\n\nAs for Firebase, Google Cloud is adding Data Connect, a new backend-as-a-service that will be integrated with a fully managed PostgreSQL database powered by Cloud SQL. It will go into public preview later this year.\n\nWith these developments, Google Cloud hopes developers will have a broader selection of infrastructure and database capabilities \u2014 along with powerful language models \u2013 to build intelligent applications for their organizations. It remains to be seen how these new advancements are deployed to real use cases, but the general trend indicates the volume of gen AI applications is expected to soar significantly.\n\nOmdia estimates that the market for generative AI applications will grow from $6.2 billion in 2023 to $58.5 billion in 2028, marking a CAGR of 56%."

        "article_content": "Google promised its Gemini AI wouldn\u2019t be a mere chatbot replacement for Google Assistant. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll see if that pledge holds up. Gemini extensions will allow the AI to access users more Google apps rather than just Gmail or YouTube. If it works as intended, it could be the first true cross-phone AI integration.\n\nIn a blog post, Google offered a rough time frame for when we\u2019ll be able to integrate Gemini with different Workspace apps like Google Keep, Google Calendar, Tasks, and Utilities. Currently, Gemini can work with Gmail, Maps, and YouTube. The general concept is that, at users\u2019 request, the AI will be able to pull information from one app to the other without users needing to scroll to find the information they\u2019re looking for.\n\nAs an example, the Mountain View tech giant said users should be able to pull a recipe from Gmail and then add the ingredients into a note in Keep. It will also work with your phone\u2019s camera, and if users take a photo of a receipt or concert ticket, you should be able to set it as an event or reminder in Calendar.\n\nThese features should be dropping in the next few weeks, so we shouldn\u2019t have to wait too long before we try Google\u2019s Geminification of our phones for ourselves. The Gemini app has already taken over most of Assistant\u2019s former duties, and earlier this week, Google gave every Android phone access to Gemini Live. This feature lets you have a conversation with your phone in a more natural way than the base Gemini, which still works better with short and sweet commands.\n\nGoogle showcased some of these features at its big August showcase, revealing the new Pixel 9 series alongside new watches and Pixel Buds. Apple has promised very similar capabilities with its still-incoming Apple Intelligence. So far, we haven\u2019t had the chance to test either company\u2019s full mobile AI integrations. The idea seems sound, but knowing how finicky and inconsistent AI can be, we\u2019re not exactly holding our breath for a real mobile ecosystem sea change.\n\nI may have far less use for a conversational AI than I would for an assistant who can uproot the important emails from my flooded inbox. On Wednesday, Google said it was updating Gmail\u2019s \u201csummary cards\u201d and \u201cHappening soon\u201d features. Happening soon should show the most timely updates, such as deliveries or events happening, based on your emails.\n\nSummary cards now show more information right at the top of each email for purchases, events, bills, and travel registrations. You can add events to your calendar, just like before. But now you can also modify your bookings or get directions to an airport or venue.\n\nGoogle said Gemini was getting access to more than 40 languages other than English, eventually. First on the list are French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, and Hindi. The rest will come sometime in the future. Each phone\u2019s Gemini Live can support conversations with up to two languages at a time. Now even more people will be able to see their Android phone transform into an AI device. The cross-platform mobile AI does feel enticing, especially for those of us with too many things going on to remember where the hell you put that one email with the event registration. However, for those who prefer their phones to be AI-free and still get new features, you may need to bite the Gemini bullet."

Learn More\n\nArtificial intelligence company Cohere unveiled significant updates to its fine-tuning service on Thursday, aiming to accelerate enterprise adoption of large language models. The enhancements support Cohere\u2019s latest Command R 08-2024 model and provide businesses with greater control and visibility into the process of customizing AI models for specific tasks.\n\nThe updated offering introduces several new features designed to make fine-tuning more flexible and transparent for enterprise customers. Cohere now supports fine-tuning for its Command R 08-2024 model, which the company claims offers faster response times and higher throughput compared to larger models. This could translate to meaningful cost savings for high-volume enterprise deployments, as businesses may achieve better performance on specific tasks with fewer compute resources.\n\nA comparison of AI model performance on financial question-answering tasks shows Cohere\u2019s fine-tuned Command R model achieving competitive accuracy, highlighting the potential of customized language models for specialized applications. (Source: Cohere)\n\nA key addition is the integration with Weights & Biases, a popular MLOps platform, providing real-time monitoring of training metrics. This feature allows developers to track the progress of their fine-tuning jobs and make data-driven decisions to optimize model performance. Cohere has also increased the maximum training context length to 16,384 tokens, enabling fine-tuning on longer sequences of text \u2014 a crucial feature for tasks involving complex documents or extended conversations.\n\nThe AI customization arms race: Cohere\u2019s strategy in a competitive market\n\nThe company\u2019s focus on customization tools reflects a growing trend in the AI industry. As more businesses seek to leverage AI for specialized applications, the ability to efficiently tailor models to specific domains becomes increasingly valuable. Cohere\u2019s approach of offering more granular control over hyperparameters and dataset management positions them as a potentially attractive option for enterprises looking to build customized AI applications.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of fine-tuning remains a topic of debate among AI researchers. While it can improve performance on targeted tasks, questions persist about how well fine-tuned models generalize beyond their training data. Enterprises will need to carefully evaluate model performance across a range of inputs to ensure robustness in real-world applications.\n\nCohere\u2019s announcement comes at a time of intense competition in the AI platform market. Major players like OpenAI, Anthropic, and cloud providers are all vying for enterprise customers. By emphasizing customization and efficiency, Cohere appears to be targeting businesses with specialized language processing needs that may not be adequately served by one-size-fits-all solutions.\n\nCohere\u2019s Command R 08-2024 model outperforms competitors in both latency and throughput, suggesting potential cost savings for high-volume enterprise deployments. Lower latency indicates faster response times. (Source: Cohere / artificialanalysis.ai)\n\nIndustry impact: Fine-tuning\u2019s potential to transform specialized AI applications\n\nThe updated fine-tuning capabilities could prove particularly valuable for industries with domain-specific jargon or unique data formats, such as healthcare, finance, or legal services. These sectors often require AI models that can understand and generate highly specialized language, making the ability to fine-tune models on proprietary datasets a significant advantage.\n\nAs the AI landscape continues to evolve, tools that simplify the process of adapting models to specific domains are likely to play an increasingly important role. Cohere\u2019s latest updates suggest that fine-tuning capabilities will be a key differentiator in the competitive market for enterprise AI development platforms.\n\nThe success of Cohere\u2019s enhanced fine-tuning service will ultimately depend on its ability to deliver tangible improvements in model performance and efficiency for enterprise customers. As businesses continue to explore ways to leverage AI, the race to provide the most effective and user-friendly customization tools is heating up, with potentially far-reaching implications for the future of enterprise AI adoption."

For those who have been in the area a while, he also cut his teeth in law enforcement by helping during the 1998 Four Corners manhunt for the three men \u2013 Jason McVean, Robert Mason and Alan \u201cMonte\u201d Pilon \u2013 who killed Cortez Police Officer Dale Claxton and took off into the Colorado/Utah desert.\n\nHe\u2019s just released his memoir, \u201cThe Paranormal Ranger,\u201d and will be at Maria\u2019s Bookshop and in Farmington to discuss it. He\u2019s also been featured on shows, including Nexflix\u2019s reboot of \u201cUnsolved Mysteries.\u201d\n\nIf you go WHAT: Author Event and Book-Signing With Stanley Milford Jr. and his new release, \u201cThe Paranormal Ranger.\u201d WHEN: 6-8 p.m. Oct. 10. WHERE: Maria\u2019s Bookshop, 960 Main Ave. MORE INFORMATION: Visit https://tinyurl.com/y67bn8sx.\n\nThe memoir is a mix of Milford\u2019s autobiography interspersed with chapters about the Navajo origin story.\n\nMilford and Dover first got into paranormal investigations when they were called to take over the case of a Navajo grandmother, who lost a sheep.\n\n\u201cShe recounted this story of this Bigfoot stepping over into her sheep corral and taking off with one of her sheep,\u201d he said. \u201cShe called the department, and two Rangers were assigned, and one of the Rangers was a comedian; he\u2019s just constantly joking and laughing and carrying on. It\u2019s just his personality, but I think the grandmother was probably offended by that, and she contacted the chief ranger and probably chewed him out.\u201d\n\nBecause of her call, the chief called a department meeting, and told everyone that no matter how strange a case may seem, it\u2019s real to the person making the call, and every case was to be investigated as such, even if responding officers didn\u2019t believe it. And then, Milford said, the chief looked over at him and Dover and said they were going to oversee these cases and manage them.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s how it happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as us being assigned to it, we weren\u2019t sitting over there raising our hands to be the Navajo \u2018X Files\u2019 or whatever. That wasn\u2019t the case. We were assigned to do it, and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nMilford said the idea to include the origin story into his memoir was inspired by a case in 2009 of a haunting he investigated in Window Rock, Arizona.\n\n\u201cIt was an office space, and the director had said \u2018my staff are experiencing all kinds of what they\u2019re describing as paranormal phenomena.\u2019 She approached the chief ranger at the time and asked if he had anybody that could come in and validate any of the stuff that they were claiming,\u201d he said. \u201cI put together a team of four individuals. We went in on two nights, and one of the prominent things about that case was coins would materialize and fall out of nothingness, out of thin air.\u201d\n\nAnd even after all this time, he said the coins appearing followed him: \u201cLast month, I had the most coins that I\u2019ve ever experienced ... this phenomenon still happens to me to this very day. Witnessing that with your own eyes, it really changes your worldview.\n\n\u201cIt made me realize that, like with the Navajo, in their creation story, they talk about this idea of coming through these different worlds into the physical world that we\u2019re in right now. Some of them describe either four worlds or five worlds, depending on the version of it. It got me thinking that, like with these coins, these coins are manifesting in our physical world from somewhere else. It got me to thinking about string theory and the idea of other planes of existence or dimensions.\u201d\n\nMilford said he starting thinking even further about different paranormal phenomenon that people refer to, \u201clike Bigfoot and UFOs and extraterrestrials, even the witchcraft, even the skinwalkers and things like that. I think they use the these other dimensions coming and going into our physical world from these other dimensions. That\u2019s how we experience it.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn and I lived in the woods at times, being Navajo Rangers right in the heavily forested high mountain areas, and we did not find the evidence that supports these things live out there,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou can find all of that with bears, mountain lions, cougars, coyotes and everything that lives out there. You can see where it beds down. You can see where it goes out and hunts and drinks. You can find all of that evidence of that ... but the thing with the Bigfoot, you don\u2019t see all of that evidence, although twice I\u2019ve witnessed this thing that people refer to as Bigfoot. And so I know that these things do happen, and they do exist. So it could interdimensional.\u201d\n\nAnd while he\u2019s had his share of people who don\u2019t believe in what he\u2019s seen and believes, Milford said the key is to be open-minded.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always going to have people that are going to take the opposite 180 view from what you\u2019re talking about, and I understand that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the message that John and I are conveying out there is much more important than listening to those people that are going to put it down. And John and I are open minded; we were very open minded. I remember one time we presented in Dulce, New Mexico, at one other UFO thing. There was an elderly Native woman that came up to us. She was in her mid 80s, and she came up to us with tears in her eyes and hugged us after we did our presentation. She said, \u2018Thank you for doing what you do.\u2019 She went on to convey a story about when she was a young girl encountering her UFO and her family members are standing around her with their jaws wide open because she never, ever shared that experience with them. I think, out of fear of being ridiculed or shunned, or whatever it might be, she never shared that experience. She thanked us and she said, you\u2019re giving people that have these experiences more or less a forum to be able to come together and share these experiences with like-minded people that are willing to listen.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s really, ultimately what the book is: to let people know that these experiences do happen, and to be respectful of others that do have these experiences, and letting people know these people aren\u2019t crazy, and they\u2019re not alone. And I would dare to say worldwide, if you looked at every family on this planet, if you looked in the history of their family, there\u2019s probably somebody within that family that has had some type of so-called supernatural or paranormal experience, whether it\u2019s seeing UFOs and lights in the sky or hauntings. I think it\u2019s much more common than we could ever imagine.\u201d\n\nkatie@durangoherald.com"

The vast majority of yachts rely on dirty energy for power and to supply the massive amounts of electricity they consume. Some superyachts, The Guardian reported, emit more planet-overheating air pollution per year by themselves than many small countries.\n\nSocial scientist Gregory Salle labeled superyachts a form of \"ecocide\" in his book, Superyachts: Luxury, Tranquility and Ecocide. Superyachts, Salle wrote, display, \"the capacity of the wealthiest individuals to exonerate themselves from the social and environmental cost of their activities and behaviours.\"\n\nIt is worth noting that the yacht that took Maroni to Svalbard was not a superyacht but a regular yacht, meaning that it merely creates a large amount of planet-overheating air pollution instead of a mind-boggling amount of planet-overheating air pollution.\n\nThe positive to take away from the story is that more ocean research can be used to better protect our oceans \u2014 largely from the threats caused by the very pollution that yachts create every day.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

Receive $1,000 in bonus bets if you maximize the offer.\n\nBuccaneers vs Falcons odds to use your Fanatics promo code on\n\nFanatics Sportsbook favors the Falcons as 1.5-point favorites for the game and have a moneyline set at -125. If you think Tampa Bay can pull off the upset, their moneyline is +105. The over-under on the game is at 43.5 points with -110 odds in either direction.\n\nWhen evaluating player props for tonight\u2019s games, the line I like the most is Chris Godwin to outproduce his current yardage line of 65.5 (-110).\n\nGodwin is the team\u2019s clear top target, and should be prioritized in a short week.He\u2019s surpassed this mark in 3 of his past 4 outings.\n\nAdditionally, the Falcons have been picked on by the opposing team\u2019s top wideout week in, and week out. The lowest they\u2019ve allowed through the first two weeks is 76 yards to DeVonta Smith in Week 2. That trend should continue with a big game from Godwin on Thursday night."

The Buccaneers would instantly become a serious player within the NFC if they beat Atlanta on the road on Thursday Night.\n\nThe Bucs will be at a disadvantage by having to travel, but they\u2019ll be meeting a Falcons offense that was mostly bad last week. Atlanta did not score an offensive touchdown in their win over the Saints. That likely will have to change if it wants to keep up with the Buccaneers.\n\nQB Baker Mayfield is second in the league with eight touchdown passes and fourth in the league with 984 passing yards."
