            "article_content": "iStockphoto\n\nConnecticut police officer Robert Klein, a 25-year law enforcement veteran, says he had a UFO encounter that was like something straight out of a movie. He told his wild story to Ashleigh Banfield on her show last week.\n\nKlein explained to Banfield that in April 2022 an intense, glowing light filled his police car, changed colors, and flew through the air at speeds that defied the laws of physics as we know them. He says he got a good look at the UFO, and it was a \u201cperfect sphere\u201d about the size of a Mini Cooper as it hovered just 30 feet from his vehicle.\n\nThe UFO encounter occurred on a dark stretch of road near a local reservoir in Fairfield County, Connecticut about 40 minutes into his shift.\n\nKlein claims the UFO had a \u201cplasma-like\u201d look to it and its color changed between red, green, white, and orange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen my fair share of drones and meteors,\u201d Klein told Banfield. \u201cThis was something I\u2019ve never come across before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a really strong light. It lit up the entire cab of my cruiser to the point where I was having a hard time driving because I really couldn\u2019t see,\u201d Klein continued. \u201cI was blinded by it.\n\n\u201cSo I immediately put [his car] into park, rolled down the window and blocked the light with my hand because it was very intense to see where it was coming from and what exactly it was. At that point the lights started to move along the left side of the cruiser. So it stopped right in front, off to the left. As I looked up, that\u2019s when I saw this object.\u201d\n\nHe says the UFO emitted \u201ca low hum, which was very distinct.\u201d When he trained his car\u2019s spotlight on the UFO it made an \u201cinstantaneous\u201d movement and flew across the water at an extremely high rate of speed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I sort of snapped out of it and took out my camera and started recording and taking pictures,\u201d Klein explained. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see it go from A to B, that\u2019s how fast it moved.\u201d\n\nRoss Coulthart, an Australian investigative journalist and author who believes governments are covering up their knowledge of UFOs, was later asked to address Officer Klein\u2019s claims on another show which aired on NewsNation.\n\n\u201cIn this case we have a very senior police officer, a man of high credit who\u2019s worked for his community for 25 years,\u201d Coulthart very validly pointed out. \u201cWhy would he expose himself to public vilification and ridicule, or at least the risk thereof, by speaking about UFOs?\u201d"

Who knows. But we do know that the truth is out there.\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster. com/wordplay/words-were- watching-uap\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/ newsround/57344606\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/ what-are-uaps-unexplained- aerial-phenomenon-ufos-new- name/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/ caileygleeson/2024/03/08/ pentagon-probe-finds-no- evidence-of-extraterrestrial- visits-technology/"

The app uses trained death prediction AI, which looks at various answers provided by the app\u2019s users. The AI then predicts when you\u2019ll die, as well as offers some additional ways to improve your health and live longer.\n\nConsidering how important the quest to slow human aging has become for many scientists, the actual want for an app like this is pretty high. Additionally, the information could help elderly people who are worried about outliving their money, the folks behind it told Bloomberg. Being able to more accurately determine when they might reach the end of the road is important.\n\nThe big thing with this new death prediction AI is that the app it powers is supposedly a \u201cpretty significant\u201d improvement on the current standard life tables that we utilize to determine mortality estimates.\n\nThe app\u2019s questionnaire asks many questions about the user, including things like age, gender, family history, mental health, and even information about chronic conditions. The studies it was trained on also included more than 50 million participants, so it should have a nice baseline to build off of.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nHowever, the real meat of the app is locked behind a $40 subscription fee\u2014which could be a turnoff for many, especially as this is where it hides the various suggestions for improving your habits. Subscribing will also show you a clock that counts down to your estimated death, in case you want to let the death prediction AI make things even more morbid than they already might be.\n\nWhether or not this kind of app is for you is up to you to decide. While I can definitely see the appeal of knowing how your health conditions and all might affect your mortality, I\u2019m also of the mind that I\u2019d rather not have a clock counting down to the day I\u2019m going to die\u2014even if it is just a rough estimate. That\u2019s a bit too morbid for me to think about consistently. But, if you do want to know when you\u2019re going to die, Death Clock can tell you."

(Nu\u00f1ez said she was also trying to buy Lizzie Borden\u2019s \u201cMaplecroft\u201d Mansion in Fall River around the same time.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusiness was going great, she said, but things started to unravel in July when she fired her manager, saying the spirit of John Arnold, who owned the home in the 1800s, told her the employee was stealing.\n\n\u201cI did get a message from John Arnold from the 1800s,\u201d she said. \u201cI also have records of merchandise and stuff, and know that he stole.\u201d\n\nMORE: \u2018The Conjuring\u2019 house owner fires employee, citing accusations from the beyond\n\nThe story drew attention, scrutiny and criticism from people across the world, fueling an online frenzy that Nu\u00f1ez said has since made her a target of hate, slander, retaliation and government oppression, which has damaged her reputation and business. The criticism became amplified after she engaged in multiple disputes with former employees, a TV star and town officials.\n\nJacqueline Nunez, owner of \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d house, has been the focus of widespread criticism.\n\n\u201cMy reputation and my business have been destroyed \u2014 temporarily destroyed,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNu\u00f1ez is now speaking out against the criticism, saying she\u2019s hopeful that by sharing her story she can give people a different perspective on her and what\u2019s happened. She lost her business entertainment license this month after Burrillville town officials voted not to renew it, citing concerns over safety and her actions.\n\n\u201cPeople deserve an opportunity to come to a site like ours where they can really experience this kind of energy,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Nu\u00f1ez was also quick to downplay any accountability for her own actions over the past five months, including getting arrested for drunk driving in October and being accused of threatening and harassing former employees and the family of Jason Hawes, star of the hit SyFy series \u201cGhostHunters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been running my business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWATCH: Bodycam footage shows \u2018The Conjuring\u2019 house owner\u2019s arrest\n\nHawes, who lives in Rhode Island, disagrees and he filed a police report this fall, alleging she accused him of trying to assassinate her. Hawes received a no-contact order against Nu\u00f1ez, saying she also sent threatening text messages and emails to him and his family.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still been sending me messages, even though we\u2019ve gotten the no-contact order and no-trespass order,\u201d Hawes said last month outside Burrillville Town Hall. \u201cShe\u2019s violated it and she just continues to violate it.\u201d\n\nNu\u00f1ez acknowledged that she could have had \u201ca slightly different tone\u201d with some of her texts and emails, but she accused Hawes of fueling hate toward her. She\u2019s now threatening to file lawsuits against him, former employees and Burrillville. She said the town is guilty of \u201cgovernmental oppression.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cAs the lawsuits come out, all of this evidence will come out about how they have just blatantly violated my constitutional protections,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez said.\n\nBACKGROUND: \u2018Ghost Hunters\u2019 TV star says \u2018The Conjuring\u2019 house owner is harassing him\n\nBurrillville town manager Michael Wood has pushed back, saying Nu\u00f1ez runs a 24-hour business in a residential neighborhood. The business, he said, \u201ccan be disruptive to neighbors, and it draws curious people at all hours of the day and night.\u201d\n\nHe also accused Nu\u00f1ez of being \u201cdifficult, uncooperative and aggressive throughout the licensing process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Conjuring\u201d house\n\n\u201cThe town is always willing to work with applicants for various licenses, but in this case, the\n\nrelationship has deteriorated such that the town is taking steps to protect its interests as well\n\nas those of the neighbors in the vicinity of The Conjuring house,\u201d Wood said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nNu\u00f1ez said she feels like the town is singling out and discriminating against her business because it\u2019s tied to the paranormal community, comparing the move to the violation of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t not allow a business because they don\u2019t like that it\u2019s paranormal,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be like me saying, \u2018I don\u2019t drink, therefore I don\u2019t want there to be any liquor stores.'\u201d\n\nDespite her license expiring at the end of November, Nu\u00f1ez said she has no intention of shutting down operations this month because people have already booked tours and some are traveling from out of the country.

            "article_content": "In a bizarre incident near the Thailand-Myanmar border, a Chinese man was trapped in an abandoned well for three days. Villagers had heard strange cries coming from a nearby forest, but mistook them for ghostly sounds, according to Thai media reports. It wasn't until police dispatched rescue personnel to the forest that they heard a voice responding to their calls. The crew located the source of the voice and found 22-year-old Liu Chuanyi at the bottom of a 12-metre-deep well, Independent reported. The rescue operation lasted 30 minutes.\n\nMr Chuanyi was found in a weakened state and had sustained serious injuries, including a fractured wrist, cerebral concussion, and bruises, after being trapped without food or water for three days and nights. He was rescued and taken to the hospital for medical attention.\n\nAccording to Mr Chuanyi, he strategically shouted for help once every hour, conserving his energy during his three-day ordeal. Meanwhile, nearby villagers reported hearing strange cries, which they attributed to paranormal activity. As a result, they avoided venturing outside after dark and didn't investigate the noise further.\n\nAuthorities believe that Mr. Liu accidentally fell into the well while attempting to navigate his way out of the forest. The circumstances surrounding Mr Liu's presence at the Thailand-Myanmar border remain a mystery, and authorities have reached out to the immigration department to investigate how he ended up in the area. In the meantime, local authorities are taking proactive measures to prevent similar incidents by sealing the well with a cover, ensuring the area is safer for everyone.\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread attention on Chinese social media, with many users sharing and discussing the harrowing story.\n\nOne user wrote, \"A Chinese man shouting for help in the middle of nowhere? Of course, the locals can't understand the language and might think it was a wizard uttering spells.\"\n\nAnother commented, \"Kudos to his strength and stamina. Struggling for three days and nights but still yelling; this guy is truly impressive.\""

            "article_content": "Markian Tarasiuk is not a widely known player in the entertainment industry, but he\u2019s getting there. The Canadian-born writer, actor, and director has grown an impressive resume of steady TV and movie gigs. He\u2019s been in several rom-coms, horror, mysteries, and action projects and isn\u2019t slowing down. His charm and good looks can guarantee him as a leading man star for years; however, he\u2019s looking for something more. Tarasiuk holds inside of him a creative mind aching to showcase what he\u2019s capable of as a writer and filmmaker. That\u2019s why he has decided to put his untapped talent into his directorial feature debut, Hunting Matthew Nichols.\n\nThe film, directed by Tarasiuk, was written by the filmmaking alongside Sean Harris Oliver. It\u2019s a refreshing look at the Found Footage genre that the Blair Witch Project started in 1999. In documentary style, Hunting Matthew Nichols follows Tara Nichols, played by Miranda MacDougall. Tara and Markian, played by the director, are searching to discover what happened to her brother Matthew (James Ross) and his friend Jordan (Issiah Bullbear). What starts as a simple disappearance story later evolves into supernatural elements that come off as authentic and frightening as some of the best True Crime documentaries around.\n\nTarasiuk premiered Hunting Matthew Nichols at this year\u2019s Newport Beach Film Festival, and the film has already gained much buzz. I got a chance to talk to the young filmmaker about Hunting Matthew Nichols\u2019s inception, his inspirations in telling such a compelling story, the world-building process, and what\u2019s in store for this proposed franchise starter.\n\nYou started as an actor doing television, making made-for-TV movies, and stage acting. What was the one thing that pushed you to direct and write?\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: I mean, I think everybody or every artist wants some form of control in their lives. Being an actor, you\u2019re always at the beckoning call of somebody else\u2019s vision of somebody else\u2019s project. I see being an actor as exactly a tool to be used by the director to make their vision come true. When I was creating work as a teenager, even in theater school, we were the ones creating it in control all the time. That\u2019s why I fell in love with just this art form, with movies, with theater, and just acting in general. That\u2019s how I was really introduced and found the most fun doing it. So, developing Hunting Matthew Nichols was part of a huge effort of collaboration, having fun, getting back to my roots, and finding out why I got into this business in the first place. I really do see cinema as a director\u2019s medium, where it is a vision that you get to collaborate, hire people, and come to life.\n\nI totally agree with you on that.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: And so that\u2019s why I really wanted to transition: to get into that lane again in my career where everything is based on what I love and what I love doing. This movie is definitely a reflection of that.\n\nSpeaking of Hunting Matthew Nichols, tell me about the inception of this movie.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: I\u2019m a huge fan of True Crime documentaries, huge fan. I watch everyone that comes out on Netflix, and there\u2019s always a new one in the top 10 these days. It\u2019s incredibly popular, it\u2019s crazy. So, I\u2019m just a fan of that genre to begin with. I\u2019m a huge fan of horror. When I was growing up, and still to this day, horror movies have stuck with me the most psychologically. I don\u2019t know; something about it taps into something in my psyche that is everlasting.\n\nYeah, you can do jump scares and everything, but that\u2019s temporary.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: It is temporary.\n\nIn psychological horror, you really get in the head of the characters and the monster.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: Everybody can see when watching this movie that the influences are definitely there. I used a lot of things that I love in terms of imagery and devices in this movie that I just love. So, having those two things of a horror fan, a True Crime Documentary fan, and as a teenager, I also made mockumentaries.\n\nThose are things I would very much like to see.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: If you could find \u2019em on YouTube deep, deep, deep down somewhere when I was a teenager. So that all came from, \u201cOkay, this is what I love doing, and these are things I love. So let\u2019s develop something that I think is exciting for audiences.\u201d That kind of blends that. I was watching a True Crime Doc; I forgot which one, and I shouldn\u2019t name it if I did know where the interviewees were. I Googled it, and it was crazy. The subject matter of it was crazy. I said, \u201cOh my gosh, this case is insane.\u201d I started Googling it while watching it, which I think many people will do.\n\nOh, I\u2019ve done this several times.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: However, the interviewees and a lot of the subjects came out saying that they were edited out of context. They were mismatched, and they didn\u2019t like how it was presented. The documentarians presented a different movie and documentary than the interviewees, or anybody else thought this case was, and a lot of it was made up. I thought, \u201cIf I never Googled this, I never would\u2019ve known.\u201d\n\nYeah, you just went off and took everything at face value.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: Totally. And I was like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s interesting. What if we build one from the ground up?\u201d So that was also the part of the inception of this: \u201cLet\u2019s build this.\u201d Because to me, those Netflix True Crime docs are so cliche at this point, and \u201cYou hit this at Mark 15, hit this at Mark\u2014they\u2019re all the same.\n\nThere will always be that one picture of everything was great, and then it wasn\u2019t. \u201cNegative shot.\u201d\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: Totally. And, \u201cSad sister, sad mom, we go home.\u201d So, at the beginning of our movie, I see Hunting Matthew Nichols\u2014a lot of people won\u2019t see it this way\u2014I see it as a satire to some degree.\n\nYeah, because some of the critical points at the movie\u2019s beginning had the formula of, \u201cHere\u2019s a picture of the family as they\u2019re walking in and talking about the place. I thought, \u201cIs this kind of a comedy, or Where are we taking this?\u201d\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: Yeah, I mean, because to me, when I watched those True Crime docs, it was cliched at this point. I think that\u2019s what I want to do with Hunting Matthew Nichols, which is with the audience members too\u2014you lull themselves into a sense of security with those True Crime docs because people watch them as comfort food now.\n\nI\u2019ve been guilty of that as well.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: Which is a crazy thing, \u201cMurdering and mayhem makes me calm. I love it on a Friday night with a glass of wine.\n\nOr a warm glass of milk before going to bed.\n\n[WE SHARED A COLLECTIVE LAUGH.]\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: Exactly. So, I hope that\u2019s what happens when this makes it out to hopefully a streamer. You have a glass of wine and some popcorn, and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I know this story. I\u2019ve seen it a hundred times.\u201d Then we start shifting the whole thing on its head a little bit, and we start going somewhere different. That\u2019s when, hopefully, the audience perks up, puts their phone down, and says, \u201cWait a minute,\u201d with this movie.\n\nSo I read that you\u2019re Ukrainian Canadian, is that correct?\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: Yeah.\n\nWas there anything in your past, maybe traditional lore or stories you heard from your family, that influenced how the mystery evolved into this supernatural element?\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: Totally. I mean, we talk about it a little in the movie, where we go over the forest creatures\u2014in researching and developing this movie, noticing that around the world, there is the same myth everywhere: a forest creature. We talk about it. It was created in the day to keep kids from running away into the forest and getting lost. That was the device that those stories were created by. But for me, as a Ukrainian, we, of course, have Baba Yaga, so that was the one I was told growing up. But I think further from that, I went to a Ukrainian Orthodox camp growing up, and again, you want to talk about formative years or things that were formative going to the Ukrainian camp. We had our own legend: this one of Crazy Pete, a guy with a rusty knife in the forest.\n\nI might\u2019ve heard of that one somewhere.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: Maybe. We heard it from somewhere else, but it was terrifying. I was terrified, and we didn\u2019t go in. There was a crazy cabin in the woods, Pete\u2019s cabin, and \u201cDon\u2019t go in there.\u201d And it terrified me as a kid. And again, building the legend we discuss in this movie is just based on childhood stories like that. So when I talked to Sean [Harris Oliver], our writer, about it, I told him the story of Crazy Pete, and \u201cI said, this is Roy McKenzie.\u201d It\u2019s like this nebulous can be any type of legend that everywhere seems to have. Why do we have that? It\u2019s fun if those things are maybe real.\n\nSpeaking of the influence, obviously, there\u2019s the Blair Witch Project namedrop that the kids who disappear are fans of. I feel like I got some Evil Dead with the cabin and then with the book they found in the library. It was very Necronomicon-esque. Were there any other influences from other projects?\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: Yeah, Blair Witch is a big one. When I talk about formative movies, to me, that was a huge one. The same thing happened with Paranormal Activity, which was massive for me. I wasn\u2019t around for the marketing of Blair Witch so much as I was for Paranormal Activity, but I was around for that as a teenager. There was that whole thing of, \u201cIs it real? Is it not?\u201d That really affected me, and I went to the theater to see it. I almost hoped it was real, even though I knew it wasn\u2019t. That added to the excitement of my whole experience of that film, and that\u2019s what I wanted to create with Hunting Matthew Nichols. I think to me another big one was The Ring. So, in the middle of our movie, we have a tape-watching scene.\n\nI know exactly which one you\u2019re talking about.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: And that really is that influence right there because it\u2019s the point of no return once they watch that videotape. That\u2019s what kind of summons and takes us forward through the rest of the movie.\n\nYeah, it changes it from, \u201cWhat happened to these kids,\u201d to, \u201cThere might be something supernatural and completely unexplainable.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: And it has to do with a videotape. I think why I love those projects so much and what I tried to tap into here is also a great sense of nostalgia. So, with the home videotapes, kind of these references to movies from the late 90s, early 2000s, and mid-2000s, that brings me a sense of nostalgia. This is fun to watch, but it also puts my frame of mind back to that day because it happened 22 years or 23 years ago. That\u2019s where I want people\u2019s minds to be, though. So it also feels personal in that.\n\nSo tell me about your process in directing this movie. What did you go through to give the film its creepy, atmospheric feel and to keep the mystery intriguing?\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: I think that comes in our technical elements. So, when talking to Justin Sebastian, our cinematographer, I was really clear with him, and we did camera tests. We picked our LUTs [Look-Up Tables] before we set up the look of the film really early on because we wanted it to be very, very specific. Where it\u2019s a little darker, it\u2019s a little more cinematic in many ways than just picking up a digital camera and going. Which a lot of mockumentaries do or find footage of.\n\nSome of those films give it this kind of crummy look.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: And I didn\u2019t want it to be crummy. I wanted it to be cinematic, nice to watch, and haunting and foreboding. That was also our choice when picking the time of year we filmed. We went forward in December on Vancouver Island because it was gray, raining, and dark, and there was that sense of dread and feeling trapped. When you go to Vancouver Island, that\u2019s what you feel; it gets intense during winter. So there are sometimes 60-plus days of no sun. That was always a character to me, and that was the film\u2019s feeling and look. The forest is heavy and dark. So that was always paramount when we started visually into the project.\n\nFrom that, I think it\u2019s also in our score. I gave a lot of references to my composers, which are some of my favorite scores in film that have this foreboding sense. So I wanted that to always be present in the movie. I think that\u2019s what gives us a sense of dread or foreboding or darkness. Those elements right away are those that I think audiences, visually and audio-wise, will really tap into.\n\nSince this is your first film, it\u2019s a psychological horror drama documentary-type deal.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: [Proudly] Yes. A lot of things. Thank you.\n\nAre you planning on staying within this genre, or do you want to explore other genres? And if that\u2019s the case, is there a core franchise you wish to tackle? A Freddy Krueger movie, a Jason movie, a Hellraiser movie, or anything like that?\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: I mean, I would love to. When you\u2019re a first-time filmmaker, everyone says, \u201cOh, this is your calling card. This now sets you up.\u201d As an actor, I\u2019ve done every genre, and I love the diversity of the work that I\u2019ve done, from Rom-coms, TV movies, horror movies, dramas, and all over the place. That\u2019s what\u2019s exciting to me as an actor. It\u2019s also exciting to me as a director; we\u2019re trying to build out this \u201cHunting World,\u201d which we call it. We have plans for two more films that use kind of the model that we\u2019ve built out. So we\u2019re trying to develop that.\n\nAnd if Hunting Matthews Nichols is successful and hopefully people watch it, we can do that. We have many more stories to tell that take it even further when we have more money and resources. I want to focus on this because, again, like I said, I love the Mockumentary style. It\u2019s so raw and visceral to me. But from that, I have one more horror romance project out right now, and the script\u2019s finished. I think to answer your question, I love genre-bending. I love it. My movies are a lot of things because one of my favorite movies in the last five years is Barbarian.\n\nThat\u2019s a great movie.\n\nMarkian Tarasiuk: It shifts three times, and I loved it. It was fun, it was exciting, and it made me guess what was coming next. I don\u2019t know. I think that\u2019s an exciting way to enter a movie, and that\u2019s what excites me. And I hope that my stamp on anything will be you don\u2019t know what to expect."

            "article_content": "A few years ago, my husband and I visited New Orleans for the first time in December. This trip was so memorable that New Orleans became one of my favorite cities in the US. There\u2019s something alluring about its history, supernatural lore, music, and food. Combine all this with Christmas lights, R\u00e9veillon multi-course holiday dinners, and cooler weather; December is the best time to visit.\n\nYou can\u2019t beat the weather\n\nAshlee eating Rockefeller oysters at Gallier\u2019s / Roosevelt Hotel lobby\n\nWe arrived at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. The airport was smaller than I imagined and easy to navigate. Rolling our carry-ons, we followed the signs toward the rideshares. Once we stepped outside the terminal, a cool but humid breeze hit my skin, and I was surprised. I thought it would be warmer outside.\n\nThis is when I learned that you can\u2019t beat the cooler weather this time of year in the South along the Gulf. It is typically in the mid-40s to mid-60s degrees Fahrenheit, which is pleasant for walking around and sightseeing \u2013 just don\u2019t forget to pack warm layers.\n\nStay at a historic hotel in the French Quarter\n\nHotel Monteleone\n\nOur rideshare navigated the bustling roadways of the city as I admired the sights and sounds from the car window. The driver dropped us off in front of the Hotel Monteleone.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nI\u2019m a fan of the paranormal and had heard that this hotel was one of the most haunted places in the US, so that is why I booked our stay here. Before you keep reading, I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 how romantic of me. I didn\u2019t tell my husband this spooky detail in advance. I just told him it was a beautiful historic hotel. For the record, nothing ghostly happened during our stay.\n\nWe walked inside and were immediately in awe of the dazzling Christmas lights. The lobby was magnificently decorated. We checked in, dropped our luggage off in our room, freshened up, and put on our dinner outfits. We went downstairs to try and grab a seat at the famous Carousel Bar. This bar rotates like a carousel and is an iconic city attraction.\n\nSadly, the bar was packed, so we didn\u2019t have a cocktail there. Instead, we headed out on the town to see more Christmas lights before dinner.\n\nTop spots to see holiday sparkles\n\nWe walked over to the Roosevelt to see the holiday lights and grab a cocktail. It was incredible. Then we returned to the Hotel Monteleone for dinner at the Criollo Restaurant. Criollo was one of our favorite places to eat during this trip. We treated ourselves to their R\u00e9veillon multi-course holiday meal.\n\nIn December, the Hotel Monteleone, the Roosevelt Hotel, the Windsor Court, the Royal Sonesta, the Ritz Carlton, the Bourbon Orleans, and La Pavillon all spectacularly decorate their lobbies for Christmas.\n\nGorge on beignets and explore the French Quarter\n\nSt. Louis Cathedral New Orleans\n\nWe\u2019d heard Caf\u00e9 du Monde was the best breakfast place, so we kicked our second day off walking there. My husband ordered the famous beignets, and I grabbed a coffee. He wholeheartedly enjoyed their fluffy beignets covered in powdered sugar.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nCaf\u00e9 du Monde is across the street from Jackson Square. You can walk over there and see the St. Louis Cathedral.\n\nAfterward, we wandered around Woldenberg Riverfront Park. It was a cloudy and misty day when we visited, but I loved exploring the square and seeing the Mississippi River along the riverfront park.\n\nGet lost roaming around Bourbon Street\n\nNew Orleans French Quarter\n\nI\u2019ve always been interested in magic, so we headed towards Bourbon Street to visit the Voodoo Museum. It is located between Bourbon and Royal Street. The museum was darker than expected, but I found it fascinating.\n\nThere are more Voodoo shops in the area, too. Yes, I bought a Voodoo doll (also called a Gris Gris doll), and contrary to what I have seen on TV, they can bring good luck and protection \u2014 depending on the magic spell.\n\nWhen you\u2019re hungry from walking around town and window shopping, have lunch at Maspero's. It\u2019s known for its authentic NOLA vibes and is an affordable spot to grab a bite.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nWe wrapped up the day enjoying dinner at Brennan\u2019s. I was tickled when I saw their building was pink. This upscale restaurant is famous for its Creole food, and December is one of the best times to eat here \u2013 they serve R\u00e9veillon specials (at least they did the year we visited). If you didn\u2019t make early reservations, see if your hotel concierge can help.\n\nHave a transformative psychic reading\n\nNew Orleans bridge\n\nI had always wanted to do a psychic reading, and I knew New Orleans was famous for this kind of activity. So I Googled \u201cthe best psychics in New Orleans,\u201d and Cari Roy popped up . I emailed to make an appointment.\n\nOn the third day of our trip, her assistant miraculously managed to squeeze me into the schedule at the last minute (Cari Roy books months in advance). I was ecstatic.\n\nPsychic readings are very personal, and Cari Roy was welcoming, kind, and surprisingly spot-on. I\u2019ll never forget the experience. It was enlightening.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter the reading, we grabbed dinner at Gallier\u2019s Restaurant and Oyster Bar . It\u2019s just down the street from Cari Roy\u2019s office. High on life after my first psychic reading, we splurged on Rockefeller oysters and sparkling wine. The oysters were amazing.\n\nStep into the soul of New Orleans\n\nThe Spotted Cat Club\n\nOn our last night, we caught a taxi to Frenchmen Street to visit a few jazz clubs. Some of the bars required covers, and others did not. We were on a mission to check out the Spotted Cat before calling it a night. It\u2019s one of the most famous jazz clubs in the city.\n\nOther things to do while visiting\n\nCanal Street streetcar\n\nIf you have more time to spend in New Orleans, or if this is your second or third trip here, people love going on ghost tours , seeing the famous cemeteries, and visiting the National WWII Museum .\n\nYou can also shop on Royal Street, look for antiques on Magazine Street, or take the streetcar ."

A yearly membership for the program starts at $499 a year. Since launching nationwide in November, the company has amassed over 100,000 members.\n\nWith this new partnership, Function Health members will have access to GRAIL\u2019s Galleri test \u2014 a first-of-its-kind, multi-cancer early detection test that screens for over 50 different types of cancers with a simple blood draw.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOffering the Galleri test in collaboration with GRAIL is essential to ensuring that multi-cancer early detection becomes a routine part of people\u2019s annual health checkups in addition to other recommended screenings, giving us a better chance to screen for cancer before it becomes symptomatic when there may be more treatment options,\u201d Mark Hyman, Function Health co-founder and chief medical officer, said in a press release.\n\nThe clinically validated test works by looking for patterns in DNA, or what the company calls \u2018fingerprints,\u201d of different types of cancers before they become symptomatic.\n\nAlthough, the test is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, physicians are allowed to order the test under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) because they are processed in a central laboratory. The test is meant to be used in addition to recommended routine cancer screenings like colonoscopies and mammograms.\n\nDoctors typically test for five types of cancers, however, about 70 percent of cancer deaths come from types that don\u2019t currently have proven screening tests.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn 2024, cancer is expected to affect over two million people in the U.S., with more than 611,000 people dying from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nFunction Health made headlines earlier this year when it partnered with Equinox on the world\u2019s most expensive gym membership. The \u201cOptimize by Equinox\u201d personalized health program includes personal training, nutrition plans, sleep coaching, and 100 lab tests from Function Health, all for $40,000 a year. The partnership is part of a growing longevity industry that is trying to leverage the latest tech to combat aging.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

Usually a respectable price of $380, it\u2019s even less expensive right now, dropping to $270 for a limited time only. Perfect for simply typing up documents on the move, studying, or relaxing on the couch with a laptop, here\u2019s all you need to know about it. Besides being good for adults, we also think it would make a great gift for a child seeking their first laptop.\n\nWhy you should buy the Dell Inspiron 15\n\nAt this price, you might worry you\u2019re not buying quality, but Dell is one of the best laptop brands so you\u2019re in good hands here. With the Dell Inspiron 15, you get a basic but highly functional laptop. It has a 12th-generation Intel Core i3-1215U processor along with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. None of that is particularly impressive, but it\u2019s a strong mix with no obvious weak points in this price range. You simply wouldn\u2019t expect more RAM at this price, for instance.\n\nFor the screen, there\u2019s a 15.6-inch full HD display, which is fairly good for this price. It has a full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080 with 250 nits of brightness. It\u2019s LED-backlit, has anti-glare properties, and it has narrow borders to keep it looking sleek. Adding to the attention to detail, the Dell Inspiron 15 also has roomy keycaps and a spacious touchpad. It\u2019s designed well for work purposes, right down to its ComfortView software that reduces harmful blue light emissions.\n\nAt this price, you\u2019ll never get one of the best laptops, but that doesn\u2019t have to stop you entirely from missing out on quality. The Dell Inspiron 15 prides itself on nice additions like tiny rubber feet and bumpers on the hinge to keep it stable as you work.\n\nThe Dell Inspiron 15 is a great starter laptop or one for students on a budget. It normally costs $380, but today you can buy it from Amazon for $270. The $110 saving won\u2019t be around forever, so if it sounds like a good buy to you, buy it now before you miss out."
