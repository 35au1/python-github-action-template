Security officers described \"flashing red, green, and white lights\" with no obvious explaination."

            "article_content": "A US military witness with over 25 years of experience has revealed his own late night encounter with a UFO, that lit up his campsite and 'made absolutely no noise.'\n\nThe event came less than a month before a more senior ex-Pentagon counter-intel official, Luis Elizondo, testified before Congress accusing government actors of secretly working to 'hide the fact that we are not alone in the cosmos.'\n\nThe October 21, 2024 campsite UFO, according to the military witness who requested anonymity, hovered as close as 100 yards above him along the treeline: 'The entire area lit up brighter than the brightest full moon I\u2019ve ever seen,' he reported.\n\n'I knew it wasn\u2019t the moon because I had already located the moon prior,' the trained observer noted of this 20\u201330 foot UFO. '[The moon] was a dimly lit waning gibbous.'\n\nThe career military man, who reported this episode to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), added: 'I observed it for at least a minute before fear took over and I sank back down into the bed of my truck and into my sleeping bag.'\n\nThe oval-shaped 'stationary, bright white light' resembles one newly public case reported this November by Connecticut policeman Robert Klein, who professed that an orb UFO, the size of a Mini Cooper, 'lit up the entire cab' of his patrol car in 2022.\n\nFear over roughly car-sized 'unidentified aerial phenomena' (UAP), often described as 'mystery drones,' has swept the nation since November as sightings across New Jersey and surrounding states have eerily matched cases over US military bases.\n\nLocal leaders in the Garden State are 'livid,' according to journalist and author Michael Shellenberger, who obtained audio from a video briefing delivered to more than 500 New Jersey mayors by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nA US military witness with over 25 years of experience has revealed a late night encounter with a UFO that lit up his campsite. Above, Nest camera footage from a July 24, 2019 UFO case in Leominster, MA, in which a similar brightly lit object (a possible meteor) zoomed across the sky\n\nThe US military witness saw their 30-40 foot long, oval shaped UFO while camping at the the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsites just southwest of Joshua Tree National Park in California. Above: the Milky Way galaxy seen over a Joshua Tree in the park on May 12, 2024\n\n'One of them [i.e. a mayor] got up there,' Shellenberger told Fox News, 'and said, \"I had two automobile-sized drones hovering over my house.\"'\n\nThe newly public military witness's case, as he told NUFORC was itself roughly 8\u201310 feet tall, making this bright oval UFO about the size of a school bus.\n\nThe sighting, which the military man said lasted for over a full minute, occurred at the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsites, just southwest of Joshua Tree National Park in California where he was 'the only camper/hunter in the area that night.'\n\n'I was laying in the tarped bed of my truck,' he told NURFOC, a 501(c)3 nonprofit that has coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on UFOs for decades.\n\n'It was pitch black out,' he said, as the waning gibbous moon was shining weakly \u2014 when 'instantly' the ordinary noises of the insects and animals in the wild 'went completely silent' as the UFO appeared.\n\n'It made absolutely no noise, didn\u2019t pulsate or move, and did not radiate any sort of heat,' he said, adding the temperature was 'about 40 degrees Fahrenheit' that night.\n\nBy his estimation, this 'stationary, bright white light' was 'about the size of a medium sized helicopter but with the light encompassing the entire object' as it hovered at 'tree top level, behind an about 30-40 foot tall pine tree, only about 100 yards away.'\n\nThe encounter, which ended as abruptly as it began, differed from Officer Klein's encounter with a car-sized glowing orb UFO in that the Connecticut policeman's sighting pulsated its light from white to red to green to orange.\n\nThe veteran cop took pains to emphasize to NewsNation that, in the early moments of his encounter, he was able to get 'a very close-up view of it' from 30 feet below the hovering, orb-like object: 'It wasn't a drone \u2014 I can guarantee you that.'\n\nSwarms of drones have been spotted in the skies of New Jersey for weeks, sparking officials to call for a 'limited state of emergency' - with drone bans taking effect in some areas\n\nMayor Mike Ghassali of Montvale, New Jersey took to Facebook to reveal what happened to a resident's quadcopter drone when they had a run-in with a mysterious drone UFO hovering in the air nearby - noting there was 'sophisticated' technology at play in this December 15 event\n\nThe military witness delivered the coordinates of his October 2024 UFO sighting as 33 degrees 32' 12.8\" North and 116 degrees 27' 38.7\" West (red pin, above) - placing him at the Santa Rosa Mountain Yellow Post campsite east of Los Angeles at the time of his\n\n'I froze,' Klein said, recalling that moment looking up at the object. 'I wasn't in fear. I just was really trying to understand what exactly I was looking at.'\n\n'I was trying to just process what I was looking at,' he said. 'Still to this day, I'm perplexed.'\n\nSpeaking before Congress this past November, Luis Elizondo, the former head of the Defense Department's UFO-hunting Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), criticized federal officials for 'excessive secrecy' on the UFO issue.\n\n'I believe that we as Americans can handle the truth. And I also believe the world deserves the truth,' Elizondo said.\n\nThe former intelligence officer also urged Congress to pass legislation that would protect government whistleblowers afraid to reveal what they know about UFOs, a common refrain among those testifying at the November 13, 2024 open hearing.\n\nThe hearing, held by the House Oversight committee, was part of a larger investigation into UFOs to determine whether any government officials have been withholding evidence from Congress.\n\n'Advanced technologies not made by our government, or any other government, are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe,' Elizondo insisted, raising unsettling implications for the rash of 'mystery drone' sightings at US bases.\n\nIn recent months, the Garden State has been ravaged by thousands of unexplained drone sightings, as over 5,000 reports of odd drones have been filed with federal law enforcement\n\nAlthough misidentifications of conventional planes have been rife amid the growing public panic, reports by from US military officials across America and Europe, alongside local police, have told matching accounts of these car-sized drones.\n\nThe drone swarm's lighting colors, as well as its behavior, match those that also made repeated brazen incursions over the restricted airspace above Air Force joint-base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, then home to America's stealth F-22 fighter fleet.\n\nFor at least 17 nights in December 2023, swarms of these noisy, small UFOs were also seen at dusk 'moving at rapid speeds' and 'flashing red, green, and white lights.'\n\nAnd these cases are almost identical to what has been reported above sensitive sites in New Jersey, like the US Army's Picatinny Arsenal, since mid-November 2024.\n\nBase police have reported 11 confirmed and unauthorized drone sightings over the arsenal since November 13, meaning security officers 'visibly witnessed a drone.'\n\nSenior ex-Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com last October that the unexplained incursions over Langley-Eustis were 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\n'In fact, in some instances,' as Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'"

            "article_content": "Joe Rogan revealed whether or not Donald Trump will release classified information on UFOs when he becomes president.\n\nIn a recent episode of 'The Joe Rogan Experience,' the podcaster sat down with filmmaker James Fox to discuss government transparency around the mysterious drone sightings - that many believe to be UFOs - concentrated in New Jersey and New York.\n\nRogan is not optimistic that Trump will be anymore open than President Joe Biden has been about UFOs and is unsure if he will release any classified documents about them.\n\n'When I confronted Mr. Trump, he was very cagey, very cagey\u2026He didn't tell me s**t,' Rogan said. 'It was basically like neither confirm nor deny.\n\n'I think he knows something, I just don't think he's interested.'\n\nReferencing a statement Trump made about the government's knowledge of the drone sightings, Rogan said: 'When you think of the capabilities of the United States military, it doesn't make any sense they can't figure out what's going on.\n\n'I think what Trump said is probably correct that the government knows, they know what's happening and they don't want to tell people.'\n\nOn December 16, Trump said at a press conference that 'the government knows what is happening regarding the drones.\n\n'Look, our military knows where they took off from - if it's a garage they can go right into that garage - they know where it came from and where it went.\n\nJoe Rogan said Donald Trump was 'cagey' about UFOs and did not offer up much information about them\n\nRogan believes that Trump 'is not interested' in the 'UFO' drones being spotted across the country\n\nThese mysterious sightings have yet to be explained by the government, but many have speculated about what they may be\n\n'And for some reason, they don't want to comment. And I think they'd be better off saying what it is.'\n\nAt one point during the Tuesday podcast, Rogan speculated that Trump has not been entertaining the UFO theories because he is 'constantly doing something' and has 'no time for f***ing aliens' or 'nonsense.'\n\nHe also believes that Trump does not have all of the information about the drone situation to release to the public.\n\nFox, who filmed the UFO documentary Moment of Contact, was adamant that this was an issue of 'national security.'\n\n'Why wouldn't he tell us?' he asked Rogan about Trump.\n\n'I don't think he knows yet,' Rogan replied, adding that things may become more clear when Trump takes office.\n\nThe pair agreed that Biden has not been clear or open about the existence of UFOs or extraterrestrial life - with Rogan urging him to 'release the hounds' before his presidential term ends.\n\n'He's been so dismissive of it all. Obama said a lot more about it,' Fox added.\n\nWhen Trump appeared on Rogan's podcast before the election, he thoroughly discussed his understanding of UFOs.\n\nHe said that 'people coming from space' were never of particular interest to him until he spokes with pilots who claimed they saw UFOS over the US.\n\n'I interviewed a few people, it's never been my thing, I have to be honest. I have never been a believer,' Trump said.\n\n'So I interviewed jet pilots that say they saw something. If you saw them you'd love to have them [on your show]...that were solid people, perfect, great pilots, everything.\n\nJames Fox argued that the UFOs are an issue of national security and asked why Trump has not said anything about what they are\n\nFootage coming out of New Jersey has only added more questions to the bizarre wave of UFOs\n\n'And they said, \"we saw things sir that were very strange, like a round ball that wasn't a comet or meteor, it was something and it was going four times faster than an F22,\" which is a very fast plane.\n\n'And it was round, which in theory is a great shape [for flying].'\n\nDuring another podcast episode, Rogan interviewed a former Navy pilot who provided shocking insight into the drones and how they have not been tracked down.\n\nRyan Graves, a former lieutenant, discussed possible technologies that could be powering the drones, allowing them to avoid being detected.\n\nHe told Rogan that law enforcement has not been able to pick up on the drones, specifically flying over New Jersey, suggesting they are using 'some type of signature management' to reduce heat emissions.\n\n'We do this in fighter jets...where we cover the engine to essentially make it harder to see, but to have zero ability to detect or lock onto these objects is not the technology I'm familiar with,' said Graves."

Credit: Schmidt Ocean Institute / YouTube\n\nAn age of discovery is upon us.\n\nEarth is an ocean planet, with over 70 percent of its surface covered in seas. With deep-sea robots, scientists regularly reveal new insights into the most mysterious realms of these expansive waters. Many alien ecosystems dwell in previously unknown canyons or cling to submerged mountains.\n\nIn 2024, the Schmidt Ocean Institute, an ocean exploration group that uses a robot capable of probing depths down to 14,760 feet (4,500 meters), embarked on a 55-day expedition that exemplifies the wild sightings found at these depths. Their remotely operated vehicle (ROV), SuBastian, spotted a colossal meeting or migration of crabs, a shimmering, psychedelic marine worm, life flourishing around deep methane seeps, and possibly 60 new species.\n\n\"Every time we put the ROV down with its 4K cameras onboard, we see some amazing biodiversity,\" Jyotika Virmani, an oceanographer and executive director of the Schmidt Ocean Institute, told Mashable.\n\n\"It was just one thing after another,\" she added.\n\nThe view below shows the impressive, uncountable amassing of crabs during Schmidt's recent Chile Margin expedition. \"Yesterday, we came across a crazy conflagration of crabs 400 meters down. Migration route? Mating season?\" Jeffrey Marlow, a biologist from Boston University and chief scientist of the trip, posted online.\n\nSubmersibles crewed by biologists can certainly perform unique science, but ROVs have exploration benefits. Unlike people, they don't need oxygen, and can stay down for a long time. \"We can operate it for two days if we need to,\" Virmani said. It's relatively easy to try out new technologies aboard these robots, and the ROV can also collect and bring samples back to the surface.\n\nBelow, you'll find the otherworldly scenes captured by the Schmidt Ocean Institute and other deep sea explorers in 2024.\n\nFootage of extremely ancient deep sea creatures\n\nA deep sea mission, undertaken by the Ocean Exploration Trust aboard their 223-foot vessel (E/V) Nautilus, spotted four nautilus individuals. Creatures similar to these modern-day nautiloids \u2014 swimming mollusks residing in large shells \u2014 have been on Earth for some 500 million years, evolving much earlier than the dinosaurs.\n\nBut the creatures aren't easy to find. The Ocean Trust explorers have endeavored into the deep sea for 15 years and taken over 1,000 dives with their remotely operated vehicle. But these are the first nautiloids they've spotted.\n\n\"It's finally happened,\" a member of the exploration team said at the beginning of the footage, shown in the video below. The nautiloids were swimming in a south Pacific Ocean channel off Palau.\n\nSquid with a huge brood of eggs\n\nDuring their 55-day voyage through the Chile Margin, the Schmidt Ocean Institute serendipitously spotted a mother black-eyed squid clutching a large brood of eggs. Gonatus squids can brood up to 3,000 eggs at a time.\n\n\"It's not often you get to see that,\" Virmani said.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

OceanX often explores the deep ocean, but this scene is from shallower depths.\n\n\"The octopuses appeared to punch the fish to enforce social order and keep the hunting group moving along,\" OceanX explained in their video, below. \"Researchers theorize that the octopuses hunt with the fish to find prey more easily, and the fish hunt with the octopuses to root out prey hiding in crevices.\"\n\nDiscovery of the \"mystery mollusc\"\n\nScientists at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute identified an intriguing new deep sea species off California. It's see-through, can glow, and nabs prey with a large hood. At one point while filming, researchers watched it detach one of its finger-like appendages, likely as a decoy for a predator. The glowing appendage then floated away.\n\n\"When we first filmed it glowing with the ROV, everyone in the control room let out a loud 'Oooooh!' at the same time. We were all enchanted by the sight,\" Steven Haddock, a senior scientist at the institute, said in a statement.\n\nBelow, you can view brilliant footage of the animal, which biologists have dubbed the \"mystery mollusc.\" It now also has a scientific name, Bathydevius caudactylus, and after years of observation and genetic testing, scientists have concluded it's a species of nudibranch, more popularly known as sea slugs.\n\nWild deep sea squid sighting\n\nA baited robotic lander lured a magnapinna \u2014 a rarely seen bigfin squid \u2014 and allowed researchers from Minderoo-UWA Deep-Sea Research Centre and Inkfish to film this cryptic footage. The squid was observed in the Tonga Trench, located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.\n\n\"Exceptional\" footage of two deep sea critters\n\n\"While diving on an unnamed seamount west of Babeldaob near the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, ROV Hercules happened upon two gorgeous deep sea creatures,\" writes the Ocean Exploration Trust.\n\nSeen first is a Chaunacops, an anglerfish with a large lure. Next is a clear view of a dumbo octopus, named for its ear-like fins.\n\nShimmering creature in the remote ocean\n\nWhile investigating the little-explored Chilean coast \u2014 with seeps and vents emitting nutrients into the water \u2014 the Schmidt Ocean Institute spotted a curious, almost alien-looking species: a shimmering species of polychaete crawling on the seafloor. It's a psychedelic marine worm.\n\nYou can see this slow-moving creature's sparkling bristles, or chaetae, in the video below.\n\nPolychaetes are extremely diverse organisms.\n\n\"The visual variety among the more than 10,000 described species means a polychaete enthusiast is never bored,\" Karen Osborn, the curator of Marine Invertebrates at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, explains. \"They come in every imaginable color and pattern, from completely transparent to iridescent to candy-striped.\"\n\nPredator discovery at 26,000 feet down\n\nThe newly discovered deep sea predator, Dulcibella camanchaca. Credit: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n\nDeep Sea biologists found a new animal some 26,000 feet (7,902 meters) underwater in the ocean's \"hadal zone,\" named for the Greek god of the underworld, Hades. These researchers lowered baited traps into the Atacama Trench off of Chile, and brought up four individuals of a species now called Dulcibella camanchaca.\n\n\"Dulcibella camanchaca is a fast-swimming predator that we named after 'darkness' in the languages of the peoples from the Andes region to signify the deep, dark ocean from where it predates,\" Johanna Weston, a hadal ecologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who coauthored the discovery, said in a statement.\n\nIn the hadal zone, the deepest ocean realm, many critters depend on food sinking down from the more productive waters above. But Dulcibella camanchaca isn't a scavenger. The four-centimeter (1.5-inch) crustacean (an arthropod with a hard shell like a crab) captures smaller hadal crustaceans.\n\nDeep sea exploration does much more than illuminate wonder.\n\nScientists want to shine a light \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 on what's down there. The implications of knowing are incalculable, particularly as deep sea mineral prospectors prepare to run tank-like industrial equipment across parts of the seafloor. For example, research expeditions have found that ocean life carries great potential for novel medicines. \"Systematic searches for new drugs have shown that marine invertebrates produce more antibiotic, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory substances than any group of terrestrial organisms,\" notes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .\n\n\"There's life down there that has the potential to provide and has provided us with medicines,\" Virmani said."

            "article_content": "Scientists described numerous new species this past year, the world\u2019s smallest otter in India, a fanged hedgehog from Southeast Asia, tree-dwelling frogs in Madagascar, and a new family of African plants.\n\nExperts estimate that fewer than 20% of Earth\u2019s species have been documented by Western science, with potentially millions more awaiting discovery.\n\nAlthough species may be new to science, many are already known to local and Indigenous peoples and have traditional names and uses.\n\nUpon discovery, many new species are assessed as threatened with extinction, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts. See All Key Ideas\n\nA giant anaconda, a vampire hedgehog, a dwarf squirrel, and a tiger cat were among the new species named by science in 2024. Found from the depths of the Pacific Ocean to the mountaintops of Southeast Asia, each new species shows us that even our well-known world contains unexplored chambers of life.\n\nThis year, in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo Landscape alone, scientists uncovered 27 new-to-science species, including four new mammals, during a two month expedition. Meanwhile, the Greater Mekong region yielded 234 new species, and scientists from the California Academy of Sciences described 138 new species globally. The ocean depths continued to surprise, with more than 100 potentially new species found on an unexplored underwater mountain off Chile\u2019s coast. Two new mammal species were found in India this year, including the world\u2019s smallest otter.\n\nScientists estimate only a small fraction of Earth\u2019s species have been documented, perhaps 20% at best. Even among mammals, the best-known group of animals, scientists think we\u2019ve only found 80% of species. Yet most of the hidden species are likely bats, rodents, shrews, moles and hedgehogs.\n\nHowever, while species may be new to Western science, many have been well known to Indigenous peoples and local communities for generations. These communities often maintain sophisticated classification systems and deep ecological knowledge about species\u2019 behaviors, uses and roles in local ecosystems.\n\n\u201cFor example, the blob-headed fish, which is so bizarre and unusual, and scientists have never seen anything like it, but it\u2019s very familiar to the Awaj\u00fan,\u201d Trond Larsen, the leader of the Alto Mayo expedition in Peru from the NGO Conservation International, told Mongabay. \u201cThey regularly catch and eat them.\u201d Similarly, the ghost palm, newly named by scientists this year, has been used by Iban communities in Borneo for basketry and food for decades.\n\nUnfortunately, many species may be threatened with extinction before they\u2019re even formally named, victims of human activities like development and climate change. Some of these species could be foods or medicines for humans, but each has a unique role in Earth\u2019s interconnected web of life.\n\n\u201cThere is something immensely unethical and troubling about humans driving species extinct without ever even having appreciated their existence and given them consideration,\u201d Walter Jetz, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University, U.S., told Mongabay.\n\nHere\u2019s our look at some of the new-to-science species described in 2024:\n\nVampire hedgehog and glamorous viper among 243 new species from the Greater Mekong\n\nTrimeresurus ciliaris, a pit viper. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nHipposideros kingstonae, a leaf-nosed bat. Image \u00a9 Pipat Soisook.\n\nRhabdophis hmongorum, the H\u2019mong keelback snake. Image \u00a9 Luan Thanh Nguyen.\n\nZhangixalus melanoleucus, a tree frog found in northeast Laos. Image \u00a9 Parinya Pawangkhanant.\n\nTrimeresurus uetzi, a pit viper found in Myanmar. Image \u00a9 H.T. Lalremsanga.\n\nChiloschista quangdangii, a leafless orchid found in the trade. Image \u00a9 Truong Ba Vuong.\n\nLaodracon carsticola, a karst dragon lizard was first spotted by a guide on a zipline tour in Laos. Image \u00a9 Santi Xayyasith.\n\nThe Greater Mekong region revealed some of the year\u2019s most distinctive species. Local nature enthusiasts and researchers documented a hedgehog species with fang-like teeth, leading to its name vampire hedgehog (Hylomys macarong).\n\nThey also described a pit viper (Trimeresurus ciliaris) whose scales create the appearance of dramatic eyelashes, and a karst dragon lizard (Laodracon carsticola) first noticed by a local tour guide.\n\nThese findings illuminate the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and conservation challenges, as many species face immediate threats from development and wildlife trafficking.\n\nNew giant anaconda species found on Waorani Indigenous land in Ecuador\n\nA significant discovery has been made in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where scientists have identified a new species of giant anaconda in the Bameno region of Baihuaeri Waorani Territory. During their research, the team encountered an impressive female specimen measuring 6.3 meters (20.7 feet) in length from head to tail, though local Indigenous communities report encountering even larger individuals. The species faces multiple threats throughout its range, from deforestation destroying their habitat to direct hunting by humans and environmental degradation from oil spills.\n\nTree-dwelling frogs found in Madagascar\u2019s pandan trees\n\nIn Madagascar\u2019s eastern rainforests, three frog species living in pandan trees received their first scientific descriptions. Known locally as sahona vakoa (pandan frogs), these amphibians complete their entire life cycle within the water-filled spaces between the plants\u2019 spiky leaves. The species, now given the scientific names Guibemantis rianasoa, G. vakoa and G. ambakoana, exemplify how local ecological knowledge often precedes formal scientific documentation by generations.\n\nA new underwater mountain hosts deep-sea wonders off Chile</\n\nAn expedition in the Southeast Pacific discovered more than 100 potentially new-to-science species on a previously unknown underwater mountain, including deep-sea corals (order Scleractinia), glass sponges, sea urchins (class Echinoidea), amphipods (order Amphipoda) and squat lobsters (family Galatheidae).\n\nThe expedition also sighted rare creatures like the flying spaghetti monster (Bathyphysa conifera) and Casper octopus (genus Grimpoteuthis).\n\nThe seamount, rising about 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) from the seafloor, about 1,450 km (900 mi) off Chile\u2019s coast, hosts thriving deep-sea ecosystems with ancient corals and glass sponges. The findings highlight the rich biodiversity of the high seas as the U.N. finalizes treaties to protect international waters.\n\nToothed toads emerge from mountain forests of Vietnam and China\n\nTwo new species of rare, toothed toads were discovered in Vietnam and China: the Mount Po Ma Lung toothed toad (Oreolalax adelphos) and the Yanyuan toothed toad (Oreolalax yanyuanensis). These amphibians are characterized by an unusual row of tiny teeth on the roof of their mouths. The discovery brings the total known toothed toad species to 21. However, more than half are already considered threatened due to habitat loss and degradation.\n\nDwarf squirrel and blobfish among 27 new species found in Peru\u2019s Alto Mayo\n\nIn Peru\u2019s densely populated Alto Mayo region, home to 280,000 people, scientists working with local communities documented 27 species previously unknown to Western science.\n\nThe species included an amphibious mouse (Necromys aquaticus) found in just one patch of swamp forest; a fish with an unexplained blob-like head structure (Trichomycterus sp. nov.); an agile dwarf squirrel (Microsciurus sp. nov.); and a tree-climbing salamander (Bolitoglossa sp. nov.). These findings demonstrate how even human-modified landscapes can harbor biodiversity not yet documented by scientists.\n\nThe clouded tiger cat gains species status\n\nScientists formally described a new small wild cat species, the clouded tiger cat (Leopardus pardinoides), found in high-altitude cloud forests from Central to South America. This taxonomic clarification has major conservation implications, as new data indicate all three tiger cat species have experienced dramatic range reductions, with the clouded tiger cat\u2019s habitat particularly threatened by human activities.\n\nA rare ghost palm from Borneo\n\nThough long used by local Iban communities in western Borneo for basketry and edible shoots, scientists finally gave a formal name to a distinctive rattan palm after 90 years. Named Plectocomiopsis hantu (\u201chantu\u201d meaning ghost in Indonesian and Malay), the palm is known for its ghostly appearance, with white undersides to the leaves and gray stems. It\u2019s currently known from only three locations in or near protected rainforest habitats.\n\nA new family of African plants that can\u2019t photosynthesize\n\nScientists named an entirely new family of plants, Afrothismiaceae, which have evolved to take all their nutrients from fungal partners rather than through photosynthesis. Found in African forests, these rare plants only appear above ground to fruit and flower. Most species in this family are extremely rare or possibly extinct, with the majority recorded only once in Cameroon.\n\nNew orchids from Indonesia\n\nThe orchid family is immense, and new species are found most years. This year, researchers described five new species from islands throughout Indonesia. These are: Coelogyne albomarginata from Sumatra, Coelogyne spinifera from Seram, and Dendrobium cokronagoroi, the Dendrobium wanmae (a critically endangered species) and Mediocalcar gemma-coronae (endangered), all from western New Guinea.\n\nA lonely liana faces extinction from cement production in Vietnam\n\nA new genus and species of green-flowered liana, Chlorohiptage vietnamensis, was discovered in Vietnam but is already assessed as critically endangered. Its limestone karst habitat is being cleared for quarries to make cement, threatening the only known population of this unique plant.\n\nTwo new mammals from India\n\nTwo new mammal species in were described in Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve, Northeast India\u2019s biggest national park. A forest officer documented the presence of the small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinereus), the world\u2019s tiniest otter species. The small-clawed otter, protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, joins two other otter species already known to inhabit Kaziranga.\n\nThe binturong (Arctictis binturong), an elusive nocturnal tree-dweller also known as the bearcat, was photographed by tour guide Chirantanu Saikia in January 2024. The binturong is found exclusively in Northeast India and requires dense forest canopy for survival. It has become increasingly rare due to deforestation.\n\nWhile local residents had previously reported sightings of both species, these photographs provide the first concrete evidence of their presence in the park. Conservation officials believe these discoveries suggest the potential presence of other undocumented species within the park, highlighting the importance of continued wildlife surveys and protection efforts in the region.\n\nOne of the tiniest frogs ever found in Brazil\n\nScientists in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Forest described a remarkable new species of frog, Brachycephalus dacnis, measuring just 6.95 millimeters in length \u2013 about the size of a pencil eraser. Unlike other similarly tiny frogs that often struggle with balance, this species has maintained its inner ear structure, allowing it to jump gracefully up to 32 times its body length. The discovery in S\u00e3o Paulo state\u2019s remaining Atlantic Forest highlights both the region\u2019s rich biodiversity and the urgent need for conservation, as this critically threatened ecosystem now stands at just 13% of its original extent, potentially harboring many more undiscovered species.\n\nBanner image of Leopardus pardinoides, or the clouded tiger cat, as a new species.

            "article_content": "OpenAI and Microsoft have a secret definition for \u201cAGI,\u201d an acronym for artificial general intelligence, or any system that can outperform humans at most tasks. According to leaked documents obtained by The Information, the two companies came to agree in 2023 that AGI will be achieved once OpenAI has developed an AI system that can generate at least $100 billion in profits.\n\nThere has long been a debate in the AI community about what AGI really means, or whether computers will ever be good enough to outperform humans at most tasks and wipe out major swaths of the economy.\n\nThe term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d itself is something of a misnomer because much of it is really just a prediction machine, taking in keywords and searching large amounts of data without really understanding the underlying concepts. But OpenAI has received more than $13 billion in funding from Microsoft over the years, and that money has come with a strange contractual agreement that OpenAI would stop allowing Microsoft to use any new technology it develops after AGI is achieved.\n\nOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit under the guise that it would use its influence, and any AGI that is developed, to create products that benefit all of humanity. The idea behind cutting off Microsoft once AGI is attained is that unfettered access to OpenAI intellectual property could unduly concentrate power in the tech giant. In order to incentivize it for investing billions in the nonprofit then, Microsoft\u2019s current agreement with OpenAI entitles it and other investors to take a slice of profits until they collect $100 billion; the cap is meant to ensure most profit would eventually go back to building products that benefit the entirety of humanity, supposedly. This is all pie-in-the-sky speak since, again, AI is not that powerful at this point.\n\nThe non-profit structure of OpenAI has long been considered a farce, and unsurprisingly the company announced this year intentions to pivot into a for-profit structure (while maintaining its mission to benefit all of humanity, somehow), because the current nonprofit structure makes it difficult to raise more money and compete against other AI players. Consequently, The Information says Microsoft and OpenAI have been negotiating a host of changes to their arrangement that would go into place should the company restructure. Microsoft also currently serves as OpenAI\u2019s exclusive cloud hosting provider, and OpenAI may want to end that as well as stop profit-sharing and switch to simply giving Microsoft straight equity.\n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI have been on diverging paths for some time now. It was recently reported that the latter has begun incorporating AI models developed in-house into its 365 Copilot product in order to improve cost and efficiency. It doesn\u2019t make sense for Microsoft to continue relying on OpenAI, an independent company developing similar productivity tools, for technology that it believes will be the backbone of its productivity software going forward. Especially with all the chaos and drama that has surrounded OpenAI. Microsoft needs its own proprietary tech to chart its own path.\n\nOpenAI is far away from achieving $100 billion in profit on technology whose true value remains speculative, which means it would likely have to keep handing its technology and profits over to Microsoft for a long time\u2014not great as they head towards becoming competitors and OpenAI seeks new investors, which it will need as it continues to burn billions in cash. Getting rid of the cloud hosting tie-up could also allow OpenAI to negotiate better hosting costs with an alternative provider, something Google has told the FTC in a letter imploring it to nullify the agreement."

            "article_content": "The bill tabled on 19 November by Ugo Bernalicis, a member of the left-wing party France Unbowed (La France insoumise, LFI), to remove the incrimination of \"apology for terrorism\" from the penal code has sparked a fierce controversy in the country.\n\nThis provision has, in fact, been widely used since 7 October 2023 to criminalise statements of support for the Palestinians.\n\nCritics immediately went wild. \"It must be fought with the greatest force,\" declared Justice Minister Didier Migaud. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was outraged, saying: \"It is difficult to do [anything] more despicable.\"\n\nEven within the ranks of the Socialist Party (Parti socialist, PS), an ally of France Unbowed, regional elected official Carole Delga denounced a \"moral failure in the face of the victims of terrorism and the bereaved families\".\n\nThe less severe commentators criticised LFI for a justified but solitary and poorly worded initiative. However, no political leader and few TV debate hosts considered it necessary and legitimate to address the substance of the subject.\n\nNew MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters\n\nLFI MP Manuel Bompard commented by saying that he was \"flabbergasted by the Trumpification of the debate\" and \"the intellectual laziness of the media class\".\n\nThe intent of the bill was not simply to repeal the criminal offence of apology for terrorism but to return it to the press law, from which it had been taken and integrated into the penal code by legislation adopted on 13 November 2014.\n\nThe urgent need at the time was to counter the propaganda of organisations claiming to be part of the so-called \"international jihad\" in the context of the proclamation of a caliphate by the Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq in June 2014.\n\nThe group\u2019s propaganda aimed to seduce young Europeans by glorifying its fighters, with the goal of enlisting them or mobilising them to commit attacks in Europe. The press law was totally unsuitable for facing this phenomenon.\n\nThe point of the 2014 legal change was mainly to lift the constraints that slowed down investigations, authorise pretrial detentions and immediate court appearances, allow for evidence seizures, and mobilise anti-terrorism surveillance resources.\n\nIn the traumatic, if not hysterical, atmosphere generated in France by the January and November 2015 attacks, the number of reports - encouraged by the government - for comments made on social media, in the workplace or even at school increased from 1,500 to 35,000 in one year.\n\nCriminalisation of simple comments\n\nBut since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October last year, the use of the qualification of apology for terrorism has experienced a new surge.\n\nAs early as 10 October, then-Justice Minister Eric Dupont-Moretti instructed prosecutors to pursue \"public remarks praising [these] attacks, presenting them as legitimate resistance to Israel, or the public propagation of messages inciting a favourable judgment on Hamas or Islamic Jihad because of the attacks they organised\".\n\nHundreds of investigations have been launched. By the end of January 2024, Le Monde counted 626 such enquiries targeting ordinary citizens, influencers, students, members of civil society organisations, union activists, journalists, academics (such as Francois Burgat), political leaders, local elected officials and even two LFI high-profile members: MP Mathilde Panot and future MEP Rima Hassan.\n\nThe vast majority of French political, media and intellectual elites have integrated the Israeli narrative. Those who deviate from it are treated as heretics, either \"antisemitic Islamists\" or \"collaborators\"\n\nFor having equated Hamas\u2019 \"heroic\" action to an act of \"resistance\", an activist was sentenced to pay \u20ac3,000 ($3,120) in damages to Jewish organisations that filed a civil suit against him. He was also added to the national register of terrorist offences perpetrators, FIJAIT, for 10 years, requiring him to report his home address every three months and notify authorities of any international travel at least two weeks in advance.\n\nAmong the most emblematic cases was that of a union leader, Jean-Paul Delescaut, sentenced in April to a one-year suspended prison sentence for a leaflet published by his organisation which stated that \u201cthe horrors of the illegal occupation have accumulated. Since Saturday, they have been receiving the responses they provoked\u201d.\n\nThe mere reminder of the historical context was considered a justification, as it failed to express sufficient moral disapproval, according to the terms of the judgment.\n\nPeople with Arab-sounding names have particularly aroused suspicion and police have paid a lot of attention to signs of religious practice, as though such practices indicate a predisposition to terrorism - reducing the conflict to a confessional clash devoid of any political rationality.\n\nWarnings ignored\n\nCritics of the legislation proposed by LFI have deliberately ignored years of warnings issued by various authoritative human rights organisations about France's apology for terrorism law.\n\nIn 2017, ombudsman Jacques Toubon expressed his deep concern for \"a vagueness incompatible with freedom of expression and information\" and warned against the \u201ctargeting of a section of the population\" (ie Muslims).\n\nIn a report issued in May 2019, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism highlighted \u201cthe weighty effects of the offence of \u2018apology for terrorism\u2019 on the right to freedom of expression\".\n\nFrance's 'apology for terrorism' law used to 'criminalise' Palestine solidarity Read More \u00bb\n\nThe report stated: \"The law is broadly drafted, engaging significant legal uncertainty, enabling discretionary overreach and affecting the protection of free expression and the open exchange of ideas in a robust democracy.\"\n\nMore recently, in April, the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (CNCDH) explained to the justice minister that its circular \"may have generated confusion between approval, praise of a crime and/or criminals, and stances relating to the context in which they were committed. The latter are part of a debate of ideas and should therefore be able to enjoy freedom of expression\".\n\nEven a former anti-terrorist judge, Marc Trevidic, who had recommended the inclusion of the apology for terrorism offence in the penal code at the time, denounced\"a totally perverted use of the law\" last October.\n\n\"A simple tag in support of Palestine makes you risk prison,\" he wrote, calling for \"a U-turn\".\n\nJudges as guardians of dogma\n\nIn such an atmosphere, the LFI bill has little chance of being included on the parliamentary agenda. On the other hand, the irrational fury it has triggered says a lot about the evolution of the public debate in France.\n\nThe time when Jean-Paul Sartre could say, the day after the hostage-taking of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games by the Black September organisation, that \"the Palestinians have no other choice for lack of weapons, defenders than to resort to terrorism\" seems far removed from today.\n\nBy granting immunity to Netanyahu, France is fuelling the genocide Read More \u00bb\n\nThe philosopher\u2019s statement, while not consensual, resonated with the still vivid historical memory of national liberation struggles.\n\nOne may even think that if two former presidents, Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou, were alive in our time, they could have been targeted by a denunciation for the apology for terrorism. In November 1967, Charles de Gaulle declared: \u201cIsrael is setting up in the territories it has captured an occupation that will inevitably involve oppression, repression and expulsions, and a resistance to this occupation is forming, which Israel in turn classes as terrorism.\u201d\n\nAfter the Munich events, Pompidou said: \"We will not eliminate Palestinian terrorism if we do not have some kind of solution to the Palestinian problem.\"\n\nSince 11 September 2001, the US \"war on terror\" rhetoric has progressively globalised the definition of terrorism as the figure of absolute evil, abstracted from any historical context, for which only the perpetrator bears responsibility.\n\nThe attacks committed on European soil by IS have allowed Israeli leaders to popularise their narrative of terrorism as a global threat against the West and an ideology carried by political Islam - or even by Muslims as a whole.\n\nTherefore, any attempt to rationally explain its causes is regarded as a reprehensible way of justifying it. Faced with this vital danger, only the use of limitless violence is seen as the legitimate response.\n\nThe vast majority of French political, media and intellectual elites have integrated the Israeli narrative into the republican orthodoxy. Those who deviate from it are treated as heretics, if not \u201cinner enemies\u201d, labelled either \"antisemitic Islamists\" or \"collaborators\" - a term loaded with historical significance in France, where it was used to describe Nazi allies during the occupation from 1940 to 1944.\n\nJudges, contrary to their traditional calling as \"guardians of freedoms\", are set to become the guardians of dogma. Contrary to Clausewitz's adage, according to which war is the continuation of politics by other means, in France, the law - or rather, the political use of the law - has become the prolongation of war in the realm of public opinion.\n\nThe same trend is at work in Germany and the United States. The war waged by Israel is accelerating the authoritarian and xenophobic drift of the states that support it.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye."

Here\u2019s what they said.\n\n1. \u2018Push, publish, stream and share\u2019\n\n\u201cLocal news must embrace a push, publish, stream and share mentality, delivering stories instantly across multiplatform rather than relying on what we know as traditional appointment viewing.\u201d \u2013 Kelly Frank, president and general manager, KYW, Philadelphia\n\n\u201cThere will need to be a greater look at meeting people where they are in digital spaces. Which means figuring out how to produce content for all platforms \u2014 not just television.\u201d \u2013 Vicki Bradley, station manager, WTXL, Tallahassee\n\n\u201cLocal newsroom staffers must think of themselves as newsroom factories in 2025 distributing its local content on multiple platforms and segmenting that content based on demographic and psychographic data. As viewers shift and the revenue follows, local stations have to continue the pivot to streaming.\u201d \u2013 Princell Hair, former president, Allen Media Broadcasting\n\n\u201cThe media landscape is evolving. Fast. But I believe that change is exciting for station groups and newsrooms focused on differentiating quality content. I think stations and reporters will be looking at ways new technology can help story gathering and storytelling. We\u2019ve dipped our toe by incorporating things like Google Pinpoint, but what\u2019s next? Where do we go from here?\u201d \u2013 Lee Zurik, senior vice president, news strategy and innovation, Gray Media\n\n2. Community-focused storytelling\n\n\u201cExpect a continued emphasis toward on-the-ground journalism. Audiences seek connection and stories that uplift and unite their communities. Journalists in the community will matter because it shares the best of their communities. At CBS, we see and understand that value and have already placed an emphasis on community journalism.\u201d \u2013 Frank, KYW\n\n\u201cI think we will all continue exploring these new storytelling techniques but will also continue to look at ways to engage diverse audiences and integrate digital platforms to meet evolving viewer preferences.\u201d \u2013 Zurik, Gray\n\n3. Building trust, more transparency and accountability\n\n\u201cNewsrooms must prioritize transparency, visually and verbally connecting audiences to sources and facts to combat \u2018fake news\u2019 narratives and people\u2019s assumption of media bias. Taking viewers through the journey with us on the streets will be key.\u201d \u2013 Frank, KYW\n\n\u201cLocal news stations will need to spend a fair amount of time in 2025 regaining the trust of their audiences following this year\u2019s election cycle. And the best way to build that trust is through transparency.\u201d \u2013 Hair\n\n4. AI: Experiment and implement\n\n\u201cMore news organizations will embrace AI \u2014 and how it can help their organizations work more efficiently. In some newsrooms, people already use AI for the creation of digital stories, or even something as simple as transcribing interviews. There is still much to be looked into and researched on the extent we want AI in our newsrooms.\u201d \u2013 Bradley, WTXL\n\n\u201cLocal newsrooms will continue to look for efficiencies in 2025 whether it\u2019s through the use of artificial intelligence, consolidation or simply doing more with less.\u201d \u2013 Hair\n\n5. An increase in mergers\n\n\u201cConventional wisdom is that the new regulatory environment in 2025 will prompt an increase in M&A (mergers and acquisitions). While M&A is necessary for the survival of some stations, especially in the smaller markets, it could mean that there are fewer independent voices in each market. It is therefore incumbent on the stations left in those markets to hold themselves to the highest standard of journalism.\u201d \u2013 Hair\n\n6. New relationships: Local broadcasters + professional sports\n\n\u201cLocal sports rights for professional teams will continue to go \u2018back to the future\u2019 in 2025 and revert to local stations as the RSN (regional sports network) model continues to evolve. This will allow the local stations to build new relationships with fans and the teams benefit from broader distribution.\u201d \u2013 Hair\n\n7. The need for multiskilled journalists\n\n\u201cAs tech-savvy talent continues to enter newsrooms, being adept at shooting, editing and storytelling across platforms will be a major priority.\u201d \u2013 Frank, KYW"

Pictured: Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Bucky Irving reacts after making a first down.\n\nAn unorthodox Week 17 in the NFL has already featured two Christmas games on Netflix, along with a showdown looming in the Windy City on Thursday night.\n\nAfter going a perfect 5-0 with last week's NFL picks, let's dive into my selections for the weekend slate. My favorite NFL player props for Week 17 kick-off by backing standout rookie running back Bucky Irving.\n\nNFL Week 17 prop picks\n\nBucky Irving o76.5 rushing yards (-110\n\nBucky Irving o76.5 rushing yards (-110 Jonnu Smith o48.5 receiving yards (-115)\n\nJonnu Smith o48.5 receiving yards (-115) Jonathan Taylor u6.5 receiving yards (-110)\n\nClick on each pick to see full analysis.\n\nNFL prop picks for Week 17\n\nBucky Irving Over 76.5 rushing yards\n\nAlthough Bucky Irving started the season as Rachaad White's backup, the rookie has made it clear who the head of the table is in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back room.\n\nEntering Week 17, Irving has emerged as the new RB1, averaging 5.2 yards per carry in December. He's set to take on a Carolina Panthers run defense that ranks dead-last against the run, surrendering a whopping 5.1 yards per carry.\n\nIrving saw 15 carries last week despite Tampa Bay trailing by double-digits early on, and a run-heavy game script should be in effect against a Panthers side that gave up 152 yards on 25 attempts to Irving back in Week 13.\n\nPick: Bucky Irving Over 76.5 rushing yards (-110 at bet365)\n\nPick made on 12-26\n\nJonnu Smith Over 48.5 receiving yards\n\nOne of 2024's biggest surprises has been the emergence of Jonnu Smith.\n\nAfter spending several seasons as a backup tight end for various teams, Smith has become one of the league\u2019s top receiving tight ends. Despite logging just a 29% snap share in Week 1, Smith has averaged 67.8% of field time over the past six games.\n\nSporting a career-high 802 receiving yards and tied for first on the Miami Dolphins in receptions, the 29-year-old has benefited from being Tua Tagovailoa's new security blanket.\n\nSmith has eclipsed 49.5 receiving yards in four of his last six starts and should be Tua\u2019s primary target on many plays against a Cleveland Browns defense that applies pressure on 41% of passing plays.\n\nThe Dolphins TE also benefits from contract incentives that will add $400,000 to his paycheck if he finishes with a snap share of 59% or more AND Miami finishes in the Top 20 in points scored and/or net yards, with an additional $400,000 if he reaches 65%. Pick: Jonnu Smith Over 48.5 receiving yards (-115 at SIA)\n\nPick made on 12-26\n\nJonathan Taylor Under 6.5 receiving yards\n\nJonathan Taylor made sure to erase all memory of his costly fumble against Denver in Week 15, tallying 218 rushing yards in the Indianapolis Colts' latest win over Tennessee.\n\nHowever, with a rushing O/U of 101.5 ahead of Sunday's matchup against the New York Giants, the value in JT's props market lies elsewhere.\n\nTaylor has quietly been a non-factor as a receiving back this season, ranking dead-last out of 49 qualified running backs in PFF receiver grade. The Colts star has just three catches on four targets over his last five games, including being shut out against the Titans and in Week 12 against Detroit.\n\nWith the Colts set to ground and pound the Giants to death and likely send out the combo of Trey Sermon and Tyler Goodson once things get ugly, I'm fading Taylor's receiving total on Sunday in the Meadowlands.\n\nPick: Jonathan Taylor Under 6.5 receiving yards (-110 at bet365)\n\nPick made on 12-26\n\nNFL Week 17 prop betting card\n\nBucky Irving o76.5 rushing yards (-110)\n\nJonnu Smith o48.5 receiving yards (-115)\n\nJonathan Taylor u6.5 receiving yards (-110)\n\nLast week: 5-0, +4.55 units\n\nSeason: 5-0, +4.55 units\n\nNot intended for use in MA.\n\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

            "article_content": "The end of the year typically brings with it an emotional look back at the days gone by. For archaeologists, looking back into the past is pretty much an every day thing. That said, here are 10 of the most interesting archeological findings that Popular Science covered this year.\n\nNeanderthals and early humans intermingled Europe earlier\n\nStone tools from the Lincombian\u2013Ranisian\u2013Jerzmanowician (LRJ) culture uncovered at Ranis. Item 1 is a partial bifacial blade point characteristic of the LRJ. Item 2 also contains finely made bifacial leaf points. CREDITL \u00a9 Josephine Schubert, Museum Burg Ranis.\n\nIn January, a new genetic analysis of bone fragments from an archaeological site in central Germany found that modern humans had reached northern Europe 45,000 years ago. This new timeline means that their arrival overlapped with the Neanderthals who had been living there for several thousand years before going extinct. It also bolsters the theory that the movement of modern humans into Europe and Asia about 50,000 years ago helped drive Neanderthals into extinction. The findings were described in three separate papers published in the journals Nature and Nature Ecology and Evolution.\n\nMysterious Iron Age burials\n\nThe skeletal remains of a frog and a human were uncovered at Seminario Vescovile in Verona, Italy. CREDIT: S.R. Thompson/SABAP-VR/Laffranchi et al., 2024\n\nA team of archeologists from Italy and Switzerland found that animals buried alongside humans might have been intended to be a meal or companion in the afterlife. They also may have been part of a complex funeral rite during the Iron Age, according to their study published in February in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nOf the 161 people buried at the Seminario Vescovile site in Verona, Italy, 16 were buried alongside animals. Four of the people at this site were buried alongside the remains of dogs and/or horses. These animals were not commonly eaten and the presence of horses and dogs was significant to the team. Earlier Iron Age findings in France and Switzerland indicate that horses and dogs were symbolic at the time and were often present in what appears to be sacrificial rituals, funeral rites, and are frequently associated with specific deities from the time. For the team on this study, the characteristics of a plot called Burial 46 were particularly interesting.\n\n\u201cIt includes the complete skeleton of a horse positioned above a woman, along with the cranium of a dog and the remains of additional horses,\u201d Marco Milella, a co-author of the new study and anthropologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told Popular Science. \u201cThis discovery provides a glimpse into a remarkably complex funerary ritual. While drawing scientifically robust conclusions from just two cases is challenging, we are prompted to consider whether this occurrence is merely coincidental or indicative of a deeper pattern.\u201d\n\nAncient Maya ballcourts were for more than games\n\n\n\nA decorative ring made from carved stone is embedded in the wall of a ballcourt in the ancient Maya city of Chichen Itza in present day Mexico. CREDIT: LanaCanada.\n\n\n\nAncient Mayans may have made ceremonial offerings during the construction of the ballcourts that they used for sporting events. Advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis helped a team of scientists detect evidence of several plants that are known for both medicinal and religious purposes. The team found evidence of four different plants that are associated with ancient Maya medicine and divination rituals.\n\nThese microscopic fragments of ancient plants were found beneath the floor of a Mayan ballcourt in present day Mexico and collecting them was likely purposeful. The findings were described in a study published in the journal PLOS One in April.\n\nThe ball courts in this study were used for several ball games, including pok-a-tok. This combination of soccer and basketball is also undergoing a present day revival. Players likely tried to get a ball through a ring in a hoop affixed to a wall. Ballcourts were considered significant places within cities and even built near some of the largest temples, including in ancient Maya cities like Tikal in Guatemala.\n\n[Related: Tooth powder unlocks clues to an 800-year-old mystery of man thrown into well.]\n\nDecoding the Norton Disney Dodecaheadron\n\nThe dodecahedron on display at the National Civil War Centre, Newark Museum. CREDIT: Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group.\n\nIn the spring, the largest known Roman dodecahedron went on display in England.The cast bronze object was uncovered in the village of Norton Disney in the Midlands of eastern England It is hollow at its middle and roughly the size of a clenched fist and has 12 flat faces are shaped like pentagons. At roughly three inches tall and weighing half a pound, it is one of the largest of these strange Roman objects ever discovered.\n\nThe dodecahedron was sitting among the ruins of a Roman pit and was likely placed there about 1,700 years ago. It was found \u201cin situ,\u201d or deliberately placed among 4th Century CE Roman pottery in some sort of hole or quarry. More archeological excavation is needed to clarify exactly what this pit was used for.\n\n\u201cRoman society was full of superstition, something experienced on a daily basis,\u201d the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group wrote in a statement. \u201cA potential link with local religious practice is our current working theory. More investigation is required though.\u201d\n\nArchaeology in space?\n\nA sample location in the starboard Maintenance Work Area of the International Space Station. The yellow dotted line indicates the boundaries of the sample area. CREDIT: NASA / ISSAP\n\nThe icy cold reaches of space is not exactly the first place to come to mind for archaeological discoveries. That didn\u2019t stop a team from California\u2019s Chapman University to see what they could find on the International Space Station (ISS). The team applied a traditional field strategy aboard the ISS for the first time. They applied the shovel test pit to analyze how the ever-changing \u201cmicrosociety\u201d aboard the ISS has adapted and changed over time.\n\nBack here on Earth, these projects typically involve digging small excavations at regular intervals across a site to gather information on how artifacts are distributed, then pick particularly promising pits for more thorough study. Since there really isn\u2019t anything to \u201cdig\u201d on the ISS, the team selected six locations throughout the space station and tasked astronauts to take daily photos of each space over roughly two months in 2022.\n\nTheir study published in August in the journal PLOS ONE identified 5,438 examples of \u201cartifacts\u201d including an augmented reality headset, Post-It notes, gloves, tools, and writing tools like Sharpie pens. While it is only an initial survey into this subject matter, it\u2019s the first of its kind to document how humans adapt to a novel environment completely removed from what we as a species evolved to handle.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

CREDIT: Professor Nick Pearce, Aberystwyth University, Picasa\n\nIn August, a new hypothesis for where Stonehenge\u2019s six-ton Altar Stone originated was published in the journal Nature. It likely originated 400 miles north in Scotland and not from Wales or other closer areas of southern England as scientists previously thought. This long trek points to the possibility that more advanced transportation methods and societal organization existed here about 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe Altar Stone is about 16 feet long and 19 inches thick and sits at the center of the circle. While it is not currently standing upright like the other stones, scientists are still uncertain if it stood vertically at some point. It arrived in the area sometime around 2,500 BCE, but its exact arrival date is still a mystery.\n\nChemical fingerprints within the grains matched rocks from northeast Scotland and were very different from Welsh bedrock. Specifically, with the age of the zircon minerals in the stone, the team is over 95 percent certain that it came all the way from northeastern Scotland.\n\nCheesy mummies\n\nTarim mummies from the present-day Xinjiang region of Northwestern China. CREDIT: Wenying Li\n\nAt least three embalmed bodies buried with some cheese on them were discovered at an ancient burial site in Xinjiang in northwestern China. The small lumps of fermented dairy, laid around the necks of the deceased, represent the longest-aged cheese ever discovered\u2013at roughly 3,500 years old.\n\nThe ancient cheese was incredibly well-preserved, but a new assessment of the chunks reveals some long-obsecured knowledge about human culture and a potential path for how dairy may have spread across Asia. The findings were published in the journal Cell in September.\n\nA new look at an Ancient Egyptian mummy\n\nLady Chenet-aa\u2019s mummy included artificial eyes to help her see in the afterlife. CREDIT: The Field Museum / Morgan Clark / Popular Science\n\nA team from Chicago\u2019s Field Museum used a CT scanner to determine Ancient Egyptian Lady Chenet-aa\u2019s burial procedure. Lady Chenet-aa lived roughly 3,000 years ago amid the 22nd Dynasty during Egypt\u2019s Third Intermediate Period. Soon after her death, one of the ways funerary experts prepared her for the afterlife was by constructing a cartonnage\u2014a paper mache-like box housing a deceased person\u2019s body.\n\nHowever, Chenet-aa\u2019s lacks any hint of a visible seam, leaving Egyptologists to wonder for years exactly how embalmers placed her inside the casing. Field Museum senior conservator JP Brown likened the mummy and its cartonnage coffin to a model ship inside a bottle.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly important that the inner coffin appeared whole and smooth without any external seams (unlike the outer coffin which was made of wood),\u201d Brown explained to Popular Science. \u201c\u2026 [and] if you look at the shape of cartonnage, the opening at the foot is too narrow for the mummy\u2019s shoulders to fit through.\u201d\n\nPompeii DNA tells a different story\n\nTwo of the plaster body casts from the Pompeii archaeological site. CREDIT: Archaeological Park of Pompei\n\nA new genetic analysis of 14 bodies recovered from Pompeii shed doubt on some of the initial interpretations of who these people were before the cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Using a new genomic analysis, a team of scientists found that their biological sexes and family relationships don\u2019t match up with the initial interpretations. The findings were published in November in the journal Current Biology.\n\nOne notable example is an adult wearing a golden bracelet found holding a child. This was traditionally interpreted to be a mother and child, but the new analysis found that it was an unrelated adult male and child. Additionally, a pair believed to be sisters or mother and daughter, included one genetic male.\n\n[Related: Focaccia likely originated in Mesopotamia, not Rome.]\n\nNeanderthals also loved to collect things\n\nThese marine fossils were found in a Neanderthal cave site, but aren\u2019t native to the area. CREDIT: Quaternary\n\nThe act of collecting objects may stretch at least as far back as our Neanderthal ancestry, according to relics uncovered in a cave in Iberia, Spain.\n\nAn archeological team analyzed 15 small marine fossils found in the fourth level of the Prado Vargas Cave system. While one artifact showed physical evidence of use as a hammer, the other 14 fossils displayed no obvious physical wear or utilitarian value. Additional evidence in the caves also points to the site serving as a semi-permanent Neanderthal encampment likely used for toolmaking, hunting, or perhaps even ritualistic activities.\n\nEarlier research shows Neanderthals engaged in cultural rituals such as ornamental crafting, cave wall art, and even familial and social funeral burials. Due to these rituals, experts argue that it stands to reason the human ancestors likely participated in pastimes such as collecting items they thought were interesting or special in some way.\n\nMaking clothes fit for the ice age\n\nMicro-CT scans of bone needle and needle specimens and the species they were compared with. CREDIT: Pelton et al., 2024, PLOS ONE\n\nIn November, a team in Wyoming proposed the idea that Paleolithic North Americans likely made needles using the bones of foxes, hares, rabbits, bobcats, mountain lions, lynx, and even the now-extinct American cheetah.\n\nBone needles like the ones from this study are common during this period in the North American archaeological record because sewing complex weather garments for freezing weather was a necessity in response to the cold climate shift brought on by the last ice age. There has been little direct evidence of such garments, but bone needles and the bones of the fur-bearing animals used to make pelts provide some indirect evidence of this early tailoring.\n\n\u201cThey were complex garments fringed with the furs of red fox, hare, and cat, some of which with feet still attached as is common among modern trappers,\u201d study co-author and Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton told Popular Science. \u201cThey were likely comparable to similar garments worn by the Inuit, able to withstand the cold and windy conditions of Wyoming\u2019s last Ice Age.\u201d"

            "article_content": "As science continues its evolution, discoveries and technologies can act like a master key that opens doors that lead to novel advancements. Artificial intelligence is one such key, making innovations possible by solving complex problems, automating tasks and enabling research that would have been impossible, or very time-consuming, without it.\n\nBut do we want to do research on all topics, and shall we try the AI master key on every door? To explore this question, let\u2019s consider the use of AI by genomics experts as an example.\n\nIn recent years, genomics experts have added unbelievable depth to what we know about the world and ourselves. For example, genetics researchers have revealed facts about when certain animals and plants were domesticated. In another example, DNA found in 30,000-year-old permafrost was used to create fertile samples of a plant called narrow-leafed campion.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImportantly, genetic engineering techniques such as CRISPR facilitate extraordinary advances in the treatment of complicated conditions, such as sickle-cell anemia.\n\nThanks to AI developments, we are witnessing a dramatic increase in the pace and scalability of genomic techniques, which will allow researchers to embark on exploratory journeys \u2014 and at the same time, add urgency to already-existing ethical issues. AI companies are also most interested in the scientific implications of this technology. We see this demonstrated in a recent interview between Harvard Business School officials and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In response to the question, \u201cWhat are the pieces of AI that you are most excited about?\u201d Altman said: \u201cGreatly increasing the rate of scientific discovery is what I\u2019m most excited about.\u201d\n\nHowever, given the risks and possible consequences of AI use in science, should we rush headlong into using AI in all kinds of projects?\n\nOne relevant example is research on Neanderthals, our closest relatives, who lived until about 40,000 years ago. Neanderthals have been studied for several years now through genetic investigation of their fossils and their DNA. Genetic engineering can potentially use ancient DNA and genome editing methods to re-create a Neanderthal or aspects of a Neanderthal\u2019s genetics and physiology.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo do this, scientists could start by figuring out the DNA sequence of a Neanderthal by comparing it with the DNA of modern humans, since they are closely related. Then, scientists could use CRISPR to swap out parts of human DNA with Neanderthal DNA. This process would require a lot of trial and error and might not succeed soon, but based on what we know about genetics, if something is possible, AI can help make it happen faster, cheaper and with less effort.\n\nScientists are excited about these developments because they could facilitate new discoveries and open up many new research opportunities in genetic research.\n\nWith or without AI, research on Neanderthals will proceed, but the extraordinary power of AI could give the final push to these discoveries and facilitate this kind of resurrection. At that point, the scientific community must develop norms and guidelines about how to treat these resurrected beings with dispositions very similar to humans. We would need to carefully consider their rights and well-being almost in the same way as when humans are involved and not as research subjects or artifacts of scientific curiosity. These ethical issues are discussed in more detail in a new paper published in the journal Nature Machine Intelligence.\n\nA more holistic question to consider is: Should we prioritize the use of resource-intensive AI, researchers\u2019 time and public funds to resurrect extinct beings? Or should we invest these resources into conserving species that are critically endangered today to prevent biodiversity from more degradation?\n\n_____\n\nMohammad Hosseini, Ph.D., is an assistant professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\n_____"

            "article_content": "Whether you\u2019re a professional event planner, putting together an important conference for work, or just throwing a big party, event planning templates can help you stay organized. From tracking costs to vendor contact information and guest RSVPs, the right system can ensure everything goes according to plan while saving your sanity along the way.\n\nmonday.com: An event planning dashboard for managing multiple events, projects, and employees\n\nPlanning an event is a lot like managing a project, especially if you\u2019re juggling multiple events alongside other projects and a team at the same time. Since monday.com is one of the best project management solutions on the market today, it\u2019s perfect for managing all three within the same platform.\n\nIt comes with everything you need (and then some) to stay organized, plus there\u2019s a free plan for up to two users if you want to try it before upgrading to a paid plan.\n\nMore on monday.com: monday.com Review | monday.com vs Wrike | monday.com vs. Pipedrive.\n\nAside from being able to handle just about any type of project or item you need to keep track of, my favorite part of this event planning template is the built-in budget tracking features.\n\nIt allows you to set a budget for an entire quarter or year and allocate that money across all of your events. Alternatively, you can set a unique budget for each event, and track spending by category.\n\nRegardless of how you approach this, you can keep an eye on your numbers and ensure you stay within your budget constraints.\n\nI also like that monday.com helps you streamline the RSVP process. You can easily send out an RSVP form to automatically track attendees without having to deal with manual inputs that are time-consuming and prone to human error.\n\nEach RSVP will show up in your system with all the details the user provided.\n\nClickUp: Event planning templates for collaborative teams\n\nClickUp\u2019s project management system is built for collaboration out of the box, including team chat, document building, nested comment threads, and more. This makes it a great option for teams planning events together. ClickUp also makes it easy to track progress and understand everyone\u2019s responsibilities.\n\nYou can get started with ClickUp for free and work with an unlimited number of users at no cost. However, most teams will get the most out of it by upgrading to a paid plan.\n\nMore on ClickUp: ClickUp Review | ClickUp vs Asana | ClickUp vs Notion.\n\nTemplate 1: Best for delegating responsibilities and tracking priorities\n\nThis first ClickUp event planning template works well for small-to-mid-sized events. I think it safely supports events with up to 250 participants, and it works equally well for smaller events with 50 to 100-person guest lists.\n\nYour entire team can use this to align event resources, visualize what needs to happen, and ensure everything gets done on time and under budget.\n\nThe default template comes with six views, including lists, calendars, and more. My favorite part is that you can set priority levels once and use color coded flags to visually understand priority in any view at a glance.\n\nOn top of that, there\u2019s a separate prioritization board that groups everything by priority.\n\nYou can easily drag and drop tasks to different sections to ensure your team\u2019s always working on what\u2019s most important.\n\nClickUp\u2019s built in commenting and mentions feature lets you alert the assignee of priority changes so everyone\u2019s always in the loop. Users can look at all of their assigned work, sort it by priority, and work down their list.\n\nThis alone can help you avoid repetitive meetings since everything\u2019s easily visible.\n\nI also like that project or event managers can look at each person\u2019s workload and rebalance everything as needed by dragging tasks to someone else.\n\nTemplate 2: Best for large corporate events and conferences\n\nIf you need to plan and host larger events, like conferences or corporate offsites, you\u2019ll need something with a bit more power. This second ClickUp template offers just that \u2014 it\u2019s more advanced than the first and takes a bit more time to set up, but it\u2019s worth it for complex vents that have a lot of moving parts.\n\nIt works particularly well if you have sponsors, exhibitors, guests, and a lot of different elements you need to stay on top of.\n\nThe best part is that it comes with a pre-built expense intake form, allowing your team to track their expenses towards your budget. Each expense can be categorized, so it works just as well for reimbursements too.\n\nYou could even set up a separate form for sponsors, guests, or vendors if you need to gather additional information from them.\n\nThe sponsor area lets you group them by tier (if you\u2019d like). For example, you could have different statuses based on donation amounts. You can also keep track of payments and donations, their attendance at your event, and even various activities to fulfill sponsor promises.\n\nFor RSVPs, there\u2019s a robust registration tracker set up for managing different types of tickets. You can simplify if you don\u2019t need all that, but it\u2019s nice to have it already built out.\n\nAnother standout feature of this template is that it can help you gather feedback after the event is over.\n\nWrike: An event planning template for ongoing internal events\n\nWrike is a highly structured project management tool that accommodates teams of all sizes. Unlike other project management platforms that restrict the number of users on the free tier, Wrike\u2019s free plan lets you onboard as many users as you\u2019d like.\n\nIt also has a range of built in views that can help manage recurring events plus all the work required to make them happen.\n\nMore on Wrike: Wrike Review | Wrike vs Smartsheet | Wrike vs Asana.\n\nWhether you\u2019re managing regular conferences, product launches, or informal parties, this template makes it easy to visualize everything and stay on top of every task required to set up each event.\n\nEach event can have its own owner, due date, priority, and tasks. Drilling down one level further, each task can also have its own assignee, status, and more.\n\nYou can plan events across your entire company in one place or break them up into multiple projects or workspaces.\n\nEach workspace can be rolled up to a higher level view, making it great for managers that need to see all the work in one place. Plus, you can use the template\u2019s built in scheduling system and request forms to track attendance.\n\nMy favorite element is that you can map everyone on a Gantt chart with dependencies. However, you have to be on a paid plan to use Gantt charts in Wrike.\n\nTeamwork: An event planner for marketers\n\nTeamwork is a robust project management system for client-based businesses. It can also work well for other types of models, but it\u2019s purpose built for agencies and freelancers.\n\nIt has all the typical project and task management features you expect plus things like retainer management, resource scheduling, built in invoicing, time tracking, customizable client views, and proofing workflows.\n\nThere\u2019s a free plan for up to five people if you want to try it out, but most businesses will need to upgrade to a paid plan.\n\nMore on Teamwork: Teamwork Review | Teamwork vs monday.com | Teamwork Alternatives.\n\nMy favorite event planning template for Teamwork is specifically for marketers who need to organize and promote events. You\u2019ll be able to plan ahead, keep track of all the work involved, and manage all the moving parts in one place.\n\nWhether you need to build an email campaign, event landing page, finalize your vendor list, this template has everything you need to stay organized and reach more of the right people.\n\nAnother standout feature is the ability to create reusable workflows you can copy to a new project in a few clicks.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve figured out the best way to promote your events, you can easily replicate it without having to add all the tasks and assignees from scratch. It can be a huge time saver, especially if you use it to plan recurring events or a lot of short events back to back.\n\nIf you like Teamwork but you\u2019re not a marketer, this template can easily be adapted to other departments as well.\n\nCheck out our curated list of the best free marketing plan templates if you\u2019re looking for something broader that will help you develop a general marketing plan.\n\nNotion: A personal party planning template\n\nNotion is an online productivity platform that brings tables, spreadsheets, documents, and collaborative elements together. It starts as a blank slate and lets you create a personalized workspace that matches your needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re using it by yourself, you can use the free plan without having to upgrade for a long time, making it perfect for planning personal parties.\n\nMore on Notion: Notion Review | Notion vs Asana | Notion vs OneNote.\n\nSolo planners don\u2019t need all the bells and whistles that come with all the project management tools we\u2019ve covered so far. This template, on the other hand, is simple and designed for personal use.\n\nIt\u2019s great if you\u2019re planning something and don\u2019t want any of the details to slip through the cracks.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to add all your action items, keep track of who\u2019s bringing what, and even assign tasks to other people. But the best part is that you can publish your workspace for free \u2014 this makes it visible to anyone who has the link, so you can use it as a digital invitation.\n\nAttendees will be able to RSVP, mention any extra guests, sign up to bring items, let you know about food allergies, or any other details you might need from them.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a simple way to make sure your next party goes off without a hitch.\n\nFree event planning templates for Excel\n\nIf you\u2019re an individual or a small team planning a one-off event, you probably don\u2019t need project management software. A spreadsheet will be more than enough, especially if you have a template to help you get started.\n\nWhether you\u2019re planning a baby shower, family reunion, or a holiday party at work, Excel or Google Sheets plus a group chat or email thread is often all you need.\n\nTemplate 1: A detailed event planning checklist for Excel\n\nTeamGantt is great for building Gantt charts, but it also offers a ton of free templates for Excel and Google Sheets. One of the best event planning templates is a pre-made checklist covering dozens of different elements you may need to keep track of.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to add your own tasks or edit the existing tasks to match your needs.\n\nRather than using a standard status drop down, you\u2019ll be able to set percentages that reflect each task\u2019s progress. It then calculates the overall percentage for each category.\n\nEach task can have its own start and end date, assignee, estimated hours, and actual hours so you can compare.\n\nAlthough this template is simple, a straightforward checklist is often all you need.\n\nIt\u2019s also available for use in TeamGantt if you want more robust visualization and tracking capabilities. With a paid plan, you\u2019ll be able to build out Gantt charts, set up notifications, and collaborate with a team using a similar setup.\n\nTemplate 2: A simple event calendar for small businesses\n\nKnack is a no-code application builder that also offers free small business templates for Excel and Google Sheets. One of their best templates is a simple event planner that\u2019s perfect for sharing a company wide calendar.\n\nRather than planning all the work that needs to happen before, during, and after an event, this template is a simple calendar that lets you and your team add events as needed.\n\nIt can work well for individuals or small teams who need an easy way to keep track of upcoming events. Whether you\u2019re organizing book signings and author readings, art classes for kids, live shows, or special discounts, it\u2019s incredibly easy to use.\n\nThere\u2019s a separate tab for each month and you can create additional copies to continue using it year after year.\n\nAny time someone needs to book an event, they can check the calendar to see when there\u2019s an open date. They\u2019ll also be able to add theirs so nobody else takes it.\n\nWhen to use an event planning template\n\nIf you\u2019re planning an event and you need something more organized than a simple to-do list in your phone, an event planning template can help ensure everything is done on time.\n\nHere are a few scenarios where a template can definitely help:\n\nAn event with more than 50 guests.\n\nRecurring events or multiple events at the same time.\n\nComplex logistics (like vendors, exhibitors, and sponsors).\n\nAttendees will RSVP and potentially add extra guests.\n\nYour event is longer than a few hours.\n\nCollaboration with others is required.\n\nYou need to track expenses.\n\nNot sure if you should use one? Create a list of everything you need to get done. If you still feel overwhelmed, a template can help you get even more organized until you feel confident everything is accounted for.\n\nTemplates, project management tools, and productivity platforms also offer other benefits, like automations, notifications, and analytics.\n\nYou won\u2019t get these from a spreadsheet or note on your phone. If you need or want any of those things, upgrading to something more powerful and using one of the templates in this guide will give you access to more features.\n\nHow to choose the right event planning template\n\nJust like events come in all flavors, templates for planning them do too. Some let you plan all the work involved, others are a simple calendar to let others know when events are taking place, and most are somewhere in between.\n\nIn most cases, you can use any of the templates here. It really won\u2019t matter which one you use because you\u2019ll be able to customize it to match your needs.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s a good idea to start with a template that\u2019s close if you don\u2019t want to do a lot of tweaking to make it work.\n\nThe following considerations can help you narrow it down:\n\nSolo vs collaborative events \u2014 Some templates are clearly meant for individuals, while others offer more functionality for working with a team.\n\n\u2014 Some templates are clearly meant for individuals, while others offer more functionality for working with a team. One-off vs ongoing needs \u2014 Planning one event is a lot easier than planning recurring events or multiple events at the same time. As such, templates for one-off events tend to be simple and straightforward while others are more complex.\n\n\u2014 Planning one event is a lot easier than planning recurring events or multiple events at the same time. As such, templates for one-off events tend to be simple and straightforward while others are more complex. Number of guests \u2014 Events with 25 guests, 250 guests, and 2,500 guests require very different levels of planning and coordination.\n\n\u2014 Events with 25 guests, 250 guests, and 2,500 guests require very different levels of planning and coordination. Budget planning \u2014 Do you need or want to track expenses against your budget? Not every event planning template offers this feature out of the box.\n\n\u2014 Do you need or want to track expenses against your budget? Not every event planning template offers this feature out of the box. Timeline \u2014 You can use something simple, like a spreadsheet if you\u2019re planning an event that\u2019s in the next couple of weeks, whereas you\u2019ll need something more advanced for planning an event that\u2019s 3-6+ months away. The same is true for planning an event that lasts a few hours vs planning one that spans multiple days or weeks.\n\n\u2014 You can use something simple, like a spreadsheet if you\u2019re planning an event that\u2019s in the next couple of weeks, whereas you\u2019ll need something more advanced for planning an event that\u2019s 3-6+ months away.

            "article_content": "Technology stocks have been in scintillating form on the market in the past couple of years, which is evident from the 86% gains clocked by the Nasdaq Composite index during this period, and the good news is that the impressive run in tech stocks could continue in 2025 as well.\n\nHistorical trends show that the Nasdaq Composite has averaged gains of 17% in the year following a calendar year in which it logged 20%-plus gains. Meanwhile, the index has averaged an annual gain of 19% in a year following a year in which it clocked a 30% jump. It is worth noting that the Nasdaq Composite index is up just over 32% so far in 2024, as of this writing.\n\nOf course, past performance isn't a reliable indicator of what the future holds, but a closer look at the trends in the technology market indicates that the Nasdaq could indeed head higher in 2025. From strong economic growth in the U.S. to robust consumer spending to disruptive tech trends such as artificial intelligence (AI), there are multiple factors that could help tech stocks soar higher in the new year.\n\nThat's why now would be a good time to take a closer look at two Nasdaq Composite components that have delivered outstanding gains in 2024 and could head higher in 2025 as well.\n\n1. Nvidia: A new generation of AI chips can help it sustain its red-hot rally\n\nShare prices of semiconductor bellwether Nvidia (NVDA -0.21%) are up 185% in 2024 as of this writing. The market has handsomely rewarded the chipmaker's healthy top- and bottom-line growth, which has been driven by the sizzling demand for its AI hardware.\n\nThe impressive thing to note here is that Nvidia trades at an attractive 33 times forward earnings despite the stock's solid surge this year. That isn't very expensive when you consider that the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 index has a forward earnings multiple of 27, especially considering the pace at which Nvidia's bottom line has been growing.\n\nConsensus estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance forecast a 128% increase in Nvidia's earnings per share in the current fiscal year to $2.95 per share. That's expected to be followed by a 50% jump in the next fiscal year (which will begin toward the end of January 2025 and will coincide with the majority of the calendar year) to $4.43 per share. However, as the following chart shows, analysts are more bullish about Nvidia's bottom-line growth and have significantly raised their earnings-per-share estimates for the next fiscal year over the past six months.\n\nIt won't be surprising to see this trend continue in 2025. That's because Nvidia's new Blackwell processors will see a sharp production ramp-up next year. Morgan Stanley estimates that Nvidia could manufacture 250,000 to 300,000 units of its Blackwell chips in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, generating between $5 billion and $10 billion in revenue.\n\nThe production of the Blackwell chips is expected to jump to a range of 750,000 to 800,000 units in the first quarter of 2025, indicating that Nvidia's revenue from these chips could multiply. The production of the previous-generation Hopper processors is expected to drop from 1.5 million units in the current quarter to 1 million units in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAs Nvidia gears up the production of its Blackwell chips and winds down Hopper, it should ideally see a big jump in its top and bottom lines. That's because the company reportedly priced the Blackwell B200 processor at a premium of 60% to 70% when compared to the flagship Hopper chip, the H200. You might be wondering why Nvidia customers would be willing to pay such a premium for its latest chips, but the cost increment should be more than offset by the 4x performance gains that Blackwell is expected to deliver over Hopper.\n\nAs such, there is a solid chance that Nvidia could continue to outperform the broader market in 2025. Assuming it does achieve $4.43 per share in earnings next year and trades at 41 times forward earnings (in line with its five-year average), its stock price could go to $182. That would be a 35% jump from current levels. I wouldn't be surprised to see this AI stock delivering stronger gains in the event of a bigger jump in its earnings as the market would likely reward Nvidia with a higher valuation.\n\n2. Palantir: It's up over 389% in 2024, and it could be at the beginning of a terrific growth curve\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR -0.29%) has set the stock market on fire in 2024 with remarkable gains of nearly 390% as of this writing. This red-hot rally made Palantir stock quite expensive, which explains why only those investors with an appetite for risk and volatility should consider buying it right now.\n\nAfter all, Palantir stock is trading at an expensive 422 times trailing earnings. Of course, its forward earnings multiple of 222 points toward a big increase in its bottom line, but it is still extremely expensive. Despite this, growth investors might still want to consider buying this hot stock.\n\nPalantir is the leading player in the market for AI software platforms. Research and advisory company Forrester recently pointed out that Palantir is a leading provider of AI and machine learning (ML) software platforms, and it is \"quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market\" thanks to the rapidly growing adoption of the company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP).\n\nSo, Palantir seems on its way to making the most of a lucrative growth opportunity in the AI software platforms market, a space that's expected to generate $153 billion in revenue by growing at a compound annual rate of nearly 41%. The company's growing influence in this market is also evident from the acceleration in its growth in recent quarters.\n\nPalantir's growth could continue accelerating as both commercial and government customers have been quick to deploy its software platforms to integrate generative AI within their operations. The U.S. Army, for instance, recently extended its partnership with Palantir worth $400.7 million for a period of four years, which can be extended to a value of $619 million.\n\nThis is just one instance of customers increasing their usage of Palantir's offerings. The company ended the third quarter of 2024 with a remaining deal value of $4.5 billion, which was a 22% increase over the year-ago quarter. This metric refers to the total value of contracts that Palantir has at the end of a quarter.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting a 25% increase in the company's top line to $2.79 billion in 2025, so its remaining deal value points toward a solid revenue pipeline that should help it sustain its impressive growth in the future as well. Palantir's earnings are expected to jump by 52% this year to $0.38 per share. The good part is that Palantir's margin profile has been improving as it has been able to gain more business from existing customers, leading to strong unit economics.\n\nThis combination of solid unit economics and the company's robust revenue pipeline are the reasons why Palantir's earnings-per-share estimates have been heading higher this year.\n\nThis trend could continue in 2025 and beyond as the company is currently scratching the surface of a massive growth opportunity in the AI software platform space. As such, Palantir stock could continue heading higher in the new year, which is why growth-oriented investors may still want to buy it even after the outstanding gains it has delivered in 2024."

            "article_content": "Decrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe generative AI landscape has morphed into a high-stakes battleground in 2024, with an army of upstarts storming the castle once ruled by OpenAI.\n\nEveryone and their tech-savvy grandma seems to be vying for a piece of the AI pie, cooking up language models, agentic AIs, image generators, and even an AI meme coin shiller or two.\n\nThe benchmarks are changing faster than our human ability to keep up. Barely a week goes by without some shiny new toy hitting the market\u2014an updated LLM here, a turbocharged image generator there, or a next-gen AI flexing some exotic training technique.\n\nBut here at Decrypt, we've rolled up our sleeves and tried them all.\n\nWe've kicked the tires, pushed the buttons, and gotten deep inside the inner workings and the outputs provided by the most popular AI models\u2014and some that are not so well-known.\n\nNow that it's clear that OpenAI isn't the only sheriff in town, we've compiled a list of the cream of the crop\u2014the generative AI models that have wowed us, befuddled us, and occasionally made us spit out our coffee.\n\nChatbots\n\nA chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users. It uses natural language processing and artificial intelligence to understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses. Usually, people confuse chatbots with LLMs, or large language models.\n\nToday, chatbots are a bit more complex, with capabilities that extend beyond text generation. They can now browse the web, generate and understand images, talk to the user, etc.\n\nHere is our list of the best chatbots you should try:\n\nGold medal: OpenAI's ChatGPT\n\nChatGPT offers a wide array of features at $20/month, including custom agent creation with natural language, a clean interface, web search, and multiple models (reasoning, writing, vision, voice, and image generation).\n\nSilver medal: Anthropic's Claude\n\nA superior LLM with an intuitive UI featuring split-screen artifacts for reasoning and code generation, Claude supports million-token context and custom agents. However, it lacks web search and image generation and often faces capacity issues, forcing users to switch to a weaker model or generate \u201cconcise\u201d shorter answers. Because of this, it cannot be the best just yet.\n\nBronze medal: Mistral AI\u2019s LeChat\n\nThis free platform is powered by Mistral Large, featuring top-tier Flux image generation and superior web search\u2014the best, in our opinion, even beating SearchGPT. It supports document/image understanding and open-source AI agents, though text quality trails competitors. However, the Mistral Large LLM isn\u2019t as strong as its competitors, making it ideal for power users willing to trade text quality for features.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Meta AI, Gemini (from Google\u2019s AI studio, not the main site), Hugging Chat, Reka, Grok-2\n\nLarge language models\n\nA large language model or LLM is an artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. You can see it as a glorified autocomplete. They are designed to predict what the most likely token (think about words, though it\u2019s an inaccurate comparison) is in a group.\n\nThe result is natural text that feels human because, well, it resembles what humans would do.\n\nHere is our list of the best LLMs to date:\n\nBest generalist: OpenAI's GPT-4o\n\nBalances creative writing, coding, and reasoning with a customizable \"Canvas\" feature, though its style can feel predictable. The latest version (from November 20) has also achieved the top spot in the LLM Arena with an ELO score of 1,366, beating an experimental version of Google Gemini released on November 21.\n\nBest for writing: Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n\nMatches or exceeds GPT-4o in many areas with more creative, human-like output, though it's prone to hallucination.\n\nBest for storytelling: Longwriter\n\nGenerates 10,000+ word stories within minutes. Do we need to say more?\n\nMost versatile: Meta's Llama-3.1\n\nThe leading open-source model with extensive customization, LoRA creation, and fine-tuning options, available in sizes from 7 billion to 405 billion parameters so users can run it on their local machines or cloud servers depending on their needs. Nvidia developed a customized version named \"Nemotron,\" which made some waves in the community and is worth checking out.\n\nBiggest letdown: Reflection Llama-3.1 70B\n\nAnnounced with high expectations, the model claimed to beat GPT-4o thanks to its embedded Chain of Thought. It ended up being a major fiasco with fake benchmarks, hidden API calls to Claude AI, and a major controversy.\n\nImage generators\n\nAn image generator is essentially a model that gets a text input and provides an output associated with that text input. So, for example, you say, \u201cGreen horse with a dragon face,\u201d and the model will generate a photo of a green horse with a dragon face. You can also input something like \u201cbusty waifu,\u201d but that is not what they are for.\n\nThese are some of the best image generators currently available\n\nBest generalist: Flux\n\nFlux dominates the latest generation of AI models with substantial customization, LoRA/ControlNet support, and text generation capabilities. It requires powerful hardware, but shows a characteristic style with extreme bokeh and slack skin detail that users are still trying to tackle.\n\nIt comes in three flavors: Pro (closed-source, the most potent model), Dev (noncommercial license), and Schnell (an open-source, distilled version). All three offer excellent image generation capabilities, and the ceiling will go higher if fine-tunes are considered.\n\nBest for realism: Recraft v3\n\nDelivers unmatched realism, offering versatile presets and better value than proprietary alternatives like MidJourney.\n\nIt has a free tier that offers the same quality\u2014though Recraft owns generations.\n\nBest for anime: MidJourney Niji\n\nUnrivaled quality for anime-style images; a Stable Diffusion fine-tuning is a secondary option.\n\nMost versatile: Stable Diffusion 3.5\n\nStable Diffusion 3.5 is a major improvement over SD3 with better licensing, detailed output, and add-on support.\n\nIt is more resource-efficient than Flux for fine-tuning and is a full model\u2014unlike Flux Schnell, which is a distilled version\u2014making it the best pick for custom models.\n\nHowever, it came out a little bit late and has been overshadowed by Flux\u2019s popularity.\n\nBiggest Letdown: SD 3 Medium\n\nEveryone expected this new model to be the new King of Image Generators, beating SDXL and every other model. It ended up being a poor model, infamous for its horrible license and horrific aberrations when trying to generate people on grass.\n\nVideo generators\n\nVideo generators take image generation one step further. They generate each frame and use it as input to generate the following one with image consistency and high prompt adherence.\n\nThis is still a work in progress, and models can only generate a few seconds of video. Below is a list of some of the best ones you can try.\n\nBest generalist: Kling\n\nRapidly improving the Chinese model, outperforming Sora in some cases. Supports face model training, and consistently generates high-quality scenes showing a major versatility in terms of styles, realism, and camera movement.\n\nBest contender: Runway Gen 3\n\nPioneering generative video app with solid environmental understanding, but struggles with fast-paced scenes.\n\nBest for storytelling: ShowRunner\n\nWe cannot tell you a lot about this one. However, in confidential testing, it has shown immense potential.\n\nBest open-source: Genmo Mochi 1\n\nIt's a great release that beats competitors like Rhymes Allegro and Stable Video Diffusion with superior realism and frame consistency.\n\nBiggest letdown: OpenAI Sora\n\nAnnounced with high expectations as a revolutionary \u201cworld model\u201d beyond any video generation, it remains unavailable today with underwhelming leaked outputs.\n\nHonorable mention: Google Veo\n\nGoogle's Veo was released on December 3. We haven't tested it, but the generations shared by Google look pretty nice. Of course, we're on the waiting list to test the model, and you'll be the first to know our thoughts as soon as we get access.\n\nMusic generators\n\nJust like video generators, music generators create songs. It\u2019s different from audio generators, however, since the outputs are more specialized to melodic outputs that are not noise, plain voices, or audio effects.\n\nUsers can rely on a separate LLM to generate the lyrics of a song or input lyrics manually, and set a few parameters like the style of the song, and then the model will output relevant music from scratch.\n\nThese are the best two\u2014plus an open-source alternative.\n\nBest generalist: Suno v4\n\nExcels in vocals and lyrics, style diversity, and long-form consistency. Its predecessor, Suno v3.5, is not free but remains a strong alternative.\n\nBest contender: Udio\n\nSuno\u2019s biggest rival. It delivers impressive composition accuracy, nearly rivaling Suno v4 in vocals. Some generations surpass Suno v3 in subjective style.\n\nBest open-source: Stable Audio 2\n\nThe open-source scene is not doing a lot in this area. Stable Audio 2 seems to be the best model, but lags behind closed-source competitors in every field. Meta\u2019s AudioCraft and MusicGen are alternatives, but far from industry-leading. Fine-tuners have not paid attention, and usually, they are the people behind the cherry on top that makes open-source models so great.\n\nEdited by Andrew Hayward"

            "article_content": "New Delhi, Dec 26 (PTI) As technological advancements like AI, machine learning and precision medicine revolutionise drug discovery, manufacturing and patient care, Indian pharmaceutical industry is set for a 'profound transformation' in 2025 with innovation, wider global access and improvement in quality becoming key themes for the future.\n\nThe industry, which is expected to grow nearly two-fold to around USD 130 billion in size by 2030, is looking to take advantage of conducive policies, demographic and digital talent, in making India play a pivotal role in advancing global health for all.\n\nCurrently accounting for around 20 per cent of the overall generic drug sales globally, the Indian pharma industry is focussing on research excellence and innovation in order to position the country as a global hub for high-quality, affordable pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"The Indian pharma market is expected to move up to USD 120-130 billion by 2030 from the current size of USD 58 billion. Initiatives in terms of quality, innovation and wider global reach will help the Indian pharma sector to realise the potential,\" according to Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) Secretary General Sudarshan Jain.\n\nGiven the conducive policies and the advantage of demographic and digital talent, India will play a pivotal role in advancing global health for all in years to come, he added.\n\nIPA represents 23 leading research-based Indian pharmaceutical companies like Sun Pharma, Cipla, and Dr Reddy's Laboratories, among others.\n\nJain said innovation will continue to be a major focus for the industry going forward.\n\nHe noted that the government is expected to soon announce the operational details of the Promotion of Research & Innovation Programme which would also spur innovation.\n\nElaborating on the initiatives lined up in the private sector, he said that leading companies are increasing their focus on specialty portfolios and diversifying into higher-value drugs.\n\n\"Additionally, the industry is set to make notable progress in areas such as CAR-T cell therapy, mRNA vaccines, and the development of complex molecules, which hold immense potential for driving future growth,\" Jain said.\n\nBesides, the patent expiries of blockbuster biologics by 2025 present a significant growth avenue in the global biosimilars market, he stated.\n\nSimilarly, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) Director General Anil Matai said the industry is set for a profound transformation in 2025.\n\nTechnological advancements like AI, machine learning and precision medicine are set to revolutionise drug discovery, manufacturing and patient care, he said.\n\nOPPI represents research-based pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Novartis and Merck, in India.\n\nBesides, strengthened regulatory frameworks will enable the swift adoption of innovative therapies while prioritising patient safety, Matai said.\n\n\"A focus on research excellence and innovation will position India as a global hub for high-quality, affordable pharmaceuticals. Collaboration between policymakers, academia and industry stakeholders will address unmet medical needs, particularly in underserved regions,\" he stated.\n\nAlso, adherence to Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) will uphold ethical standards, fostering trust and transparency across the healthcare ecosystem, Matai stated.\n\nReflecting on the year gone by, Jain said 2024 has been a year of building on a robust foundation with sustainable growth and thrust on simplifying regulations and harmonisation with global standards.\n\nThe PLI (production linked incentive) schemes have started seeing dividends with the launch of greenfield projects for the production of Penicillin G and Clavulanic acid, among others.\n\nMatai noted that the notification of the Patent (Amendment) Rules 2024, waivers for Phase 3 clinical trials for certain categories of drugs already approved in well-regulated markets, and the much-awaited Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) with European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states reflect India's progressive strides toward creating a dynamic, globally competitive pharmaceutical sector that is driven by innovation.\n\nCommenting on the healthcare segment, Fortis Healthcare MD & CEO Ashutosh Raghuvanshi said that the hospital market is projected to grow from nearly USD 99 billion in 2023 to an estimated USD 194 billion by 2032.\n\n\"Our sector is not only expanding but evolving to meet the diverse needs of our population. This year has been particularly significant as hospitals have emerged as the leading recipients of foreign direct investment within the healthcare landscape,\" he added.\n\nLooking ahead, the industry must focus on several key trends that will shape the future of healthcare in India, Raghuvanshi said.\n\n\"The ageing population will drive demand for specialised geriatric care, while a growing emphasis on preventive care will shift our focus from merely treating illness to promoting wellness,\" he stated.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and telemedicine will enhance diagnostic precision and operational efficiency, ultimately improving patient outcomes, he added.\n\nCommenting on the medtech sector, Poly Medicure MD Himanshu Baid said it is imperative for companies to step up their investments in R&D and innovation to sustain growth momentum.\n\n\"The future belongs to those who can develop transformative technologies that address the healthcare needs of a dynamic and diverse world. With initiatives like the new medical devices scheme and a favourable regulatory environment providing the necessary foundation, India is well-positioned to expand its influence globally,\" he added.\n\nAs the market is expected to reach USD 50 billion by FY30, the med-tech industry's growth story reflects the power of collaboration and self-reliance, he added.\n\nMetropolis Healthcare Promoter and Executive Chairperson Ameera Shah said as the diagnostics industry progresses from USD 13 billion in FY23 towards an expected USD 25 billion by FY28, it is fuelled by increasing awareness of preventive healthcare, an aging population, and broader insurance coverage.\n\nHowever, the path forward demands a strategic focus on technology, accessibility, and collaboration, she added.\n\nThe future of diagnostics lies in embracing genomics, digitalisation and technologies such as AI, machine learning, and data analytics, Shah said."

            "article_content": "As India lost its soft-spoken former prime minister, here\u2019s a look at how Manmohan Singh transformed the face of the Indian economy in 1991 read more\n\nIndia\u2019s first Sikh Prime Minister and the architect of the Indian economy Dr Manmohan Singh passed away on Thursday at age 92. A statement from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) hospital said that Singh died due to an \u201cage-related medical condition\u201d. The soft-spoken former prime minister was born in undivided Punjab and was touted as the man who saved the Indian economy.\n\nWhen India was on the verge of bankruptcy, Singh, who was then the Finance Minister, introduced policy changes that changed the country\u2019s economic trajectory. As India now stands tall as the fifth-largest economy in the world, Singh\u2019s revolutionary policies acted as a foundation for its growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an impassioned speech, while presenting the Budget of 1991, Singh quoted Victor Hugo saying: \u201cI do not minimise the difficulties that lie ahead on the long and arduous journey on which we have embarked. But as Victor Hugo once said, \u2018No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come.\u2019 I suggest to this august House that the emergence of India as a major economic power in the world happens to be one such idea\".\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how Singh saved the Indian economy from collapsing.\n\nPrelude to the whole saga\n\nSingh was sworn in as the Finance Minister in former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao\u2019s cabinet in June 1991. During this time, the Indian economy was operating in accordance with the Nehruvian-socialist agenda. However, the economy was struggling with external debt pegged at 23 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product and Internal public debt amounting to 55 per cent of the GDP.\n\nNot only this, the Indian employment rates went down to a negative and the fiscal deficit stood at eight per cent of the GDP. The effects of the poor state of the economy were felt everywhere with inflation rising by a good 13 per cent and retail inflation going even higher up the bend by a whopping 17 per cent.\n\nThe most concerning aspect of it all was the fact that India\u2019s Foreign Exchange Reserves stood as low as Rs 2500 crores, which was 75 per cent lower than what it was in 1990. Overall, the Indian economy was facing a major crisis and the leaders were in desperate need to bring out new reforms.\n\nSingh: The best man for the endeavour\n\nWhen Singh took the helm, he was facing the major task of changing the face of the struggling Indian economy. Many believe that he was the best person for the job. Singh had a strong background in Business, Economics and Globalisation, having obtained a degree in economics from Oxford University.\n\nHe worked in the United Nations for three consecutive years and had another stint as an advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The former premier also held the post of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 1982-1985. He served as Chief Economic Advisor (1972-1976) and Planning Commission Head (1985-1987). Hence it was safe to say that Singh knew the ins and outs of the Indian economy more than anyone who was in charge at that time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6 ways Manmohan Singh saved the Indian economy\n\nSingh was tasked to present the first budget of the Rao government, in less than a month after he took charge of the finance ministry. After evaluating the situation at hand Singh realised that the Indian economy needed a shift towards economic liberalisation and a strategic end to the \u2018license raj\u2019. Here are 6 ways Singh changed the trajectory of the Indian economy:\n\n1. Devaluation Programme\n\nSingh started his endeavour with a two-step devaluation programme with the RBI devaluing the Indian currency against major currencies by nine per cent initially and then brought down to eleven per cent two days later. This gave the Indian economy a much-needed boost to trade and deal with the International markets.\n\n2. Welcoming Foreign Investments\n\nSingh brought India out of the Nehurivan socialist ideology and opened doors to welcome foreign investment into the Indian Capital. With the introduction of \u201cLiberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation (LPG)\u201d, Singh\u2019s policies gave a boost to industrialisation in the country. With these reforms, the Indian entrepreneurs were given direct access to the required capital, technology and target markets around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Mortaging India\u2019s gold holdings\n\nThe next thing the former prime minister did was to convince the RBI board to mortgage India\u2019s gold holdings with the Bank of England in four tranches. This way, India managed to get the necessary financial assistance it needed to sail. Singh got the idea from the State Bank of India which sold 20 tonnes of gold to the Union Bank of Switzerland, for which they had received about $200 million.\n\n4. Restructuring India\u2019s trade policy\n\nSingh had to restructure the Indian trade policy since it was on the verge of being banned from essential imports such as oil and gas. Under the LPG, Singh\u2019s reforms called for doing away with unnecessary controls, streamlining the licensing process and linking non-essential imports to exports to discourage such imports. Singh took the hard decision to abolish the popular \u2019export subsidies\u2019 along with the further expansion of the \u201cLicense Raj\u201d opening the country\u2019s economy to a great extent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Taking help from the IMF\n\nGiven the crisis at hand, Singh called for economic relief from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He applied for an emergency loan of $220 million, which was later seen as the main tool which prevented India from recording a debt default. While India had to follow some of the conditions presented by the international financial body, Singh\u2019s reforms acted as a cushion between India\u2019s socialist background and the IMF\u2019s capitalist and liberalising approach.\n\n6. Market Regulators\n\nSingh also called for the transfer of full statutory powers to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to enable it to regulate the workings of the Stock Exchanges in the country. Hence, SEBI soon became India\u2019s sole market regulator. Singh went on to propose a tax concession under section 80HHC of the Income Tax Act to export of software. As a result of this concession, the Indian Software companies became more cost-effective.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Singh has garnered several criticisms from his opposition, over the years, one thing that cannot be denied is the fact that he managed to save the Indian economy from shamble in 1991."

            "article_content": "Manmohan Singh Death: Dr Manmohan Singh, India's former Prime Minister and a celebrated economist, breathed his last on Thursday, December 26, at the age of 92. He was admitted to AIIMS Delhi after his health worsened and was being treated in the emergency department. The Congress party mourned the loss of its senior leader and extended heartfelt condolences to his family.\n\nBefore taking up the mantle of Prime Minister, Singh served as the 22nd Union Minister of Finance from June 1991 to May 1996, a tenure that marked a transformative period for the nation's economy.\n\nLet's take a moment to look back.\n\n'I Didn't Take It Seriously'\n\nSingh was handpicked by then-Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to helm the Finance Ministry during a time of severe economic crisis.\n\nReflecting on his entry into politics, Singh once recounted how Rao had to personally ensure he attended the swearing-in ceremony, a role he initially did not anticipate seriously. In an interview with British journalist Mark Tully in 2005, Singh amusingly recalled, \"On the day (Rao) was formulating his cabinet, he sent his Principal Secretary to me saying, 'The PM would like you to become the Minister of Finance'. I didn't take it seriously.\"\n\nSingh added, \"He eventually tracked me down the next morning, rather angry, and demanded that I get dressed up and come to Rashtrapati Bhavan for the swearing-in. So that's how I started in politics\"\n\nALSO READ: When Manmohan Singh Scrapped 'Licence Raj' And Saved India From An Economic Crisis With His 'L P G Reforms'\n\nThe Crisis At Hand\n\nManmohan Singh's tenure as India's Finance Minister from 1991 to 1996 is widely regarded as a watershed moment in the country's economic history. Taking office during a period of profound financial turmoil, he played a pivotal role in reshaping India's economic policies and steering the nation toward liberalisation and globalisation.\n\nWhen Singh assumed office in June 1991, India was grappling with one of its worst economic crises. The fiscal deficit had ballooned to nearly 8.5 per cent of GDP, and foreign exchange reserves were critically low, barely enough to cover two weeks' worth of imports. The country was also burdened by a soaring current account deficit and mounting external debt. The severity of the situation compelled India to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for financial assistance.\n\nStructural Reforms & Policy Overhaul\n\nAs Finance Minister, Singh introduced a slew of bold and transformative reforms that redefined India's economic framework. Among the most significant measures were:\n\nLiberalisation of the economy : Singh dismantled the restrictive Licence Raj, which had stifled private enterprise for decades. This move reduced bureaucratic hurdles and empowered businesses to operate more freely.\n\n: Singh dismantled the restrictive Licence Raj, which had stifled private enterprise for decades.

Tax reforms: The tax regime was simplified, broadening the tax base and improving compliance.\n\nThese reforms, although controversial, were instrumental in averting an economic collapse and positioning India on the path to becoming a global economic power.\n\nChallenges & Resistance\n\nSingh faced significant resistance, both from within the Government and his own party.\n\nMany in the Congress opposed deregulation, fearing the political repercussions of moving away from the socialist policies championed by leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. However, with the steadfast support of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, Singh managed to implement these changes, despite the criticism.\n\nSingh\u2019s reforms earned him widespread recognition, with many crediting him for laying the foundation for India's robust economic growth in the decades that followed. His contributions were often compared to those of Deng Xiaoping, who led China\u2019s economic reforms in the late 20th century.\n\n1992 Securities Scandal\n\nDespite his successes, Singh\u2019s tenure was not without challenges. In 1993, his ministry faced criticism during a parliamentary investigation into the 1992 securities scam, a financial scandal involving irregularities in Government securities trading.\n\nAlthough he offered to resign, Prime Minister Rao rejected his resignation and reaffirmed his confidence in Singh\u2019s integrity and leadership.\n\nDecisive Shift For The Nation\n\nSingh\u2019s tenure as Finance Minister marked a decisive shift in India's economic trajectory. His pragmatic approach, visionary policies, and ability to navigate political resistance not only rescued India from the brink of economic collapse but also set the stage for the country's emergence as a major player in the global economy.\n\nHis work during this period remains a testament to his intellect, resilience, and unwavering commitment to India's progress. Even decades later, the reforms he championed continue to shape the nation\u2019s economic policies and serve as a benchmark for effective governance."

            "article_content": "The CrowdStrike outage in July 2024 sent shockwaves through the global business ecosystem, exposing widespread system failures within cloud-based security infrastructure. The incident, which affected millions of devices worldwide and resulted in approximately $10 billion in financial losses, highlighted the delicate balance between technological advancement and risk management in our interconnected digital landscape.\n\n\"The disruption created by CrowdStrike should serve as an eye-opener to companies across the globe,\"\n\n\n\nemphasizes Sreejith Sreekandan Nair, a Vice President at a global financial institution and Independent Research Scholar who brings over 16 years of specialized experience in Identity Access Management and Cybersecurity. These lessons carry particular significance for Singapore, a nation at the forefront of digital transformation. As the country continues to advance its Smart Nation initiatives and strengthen its position as a leading tech hub in Asia, the incident serves as a timely reminder of the importance of a robust preventive framework and contingency planning.\n\nProposed Framework - Bio-Inspired Defense Mechanism:\n\nIn response to evolving cybersecurity challenges, Sreejith has proposed research work to protect digital infrastructure, which he has recently published research in the International Journal for Research in Applied Science & Engineering Technology introducing a comprehensive framework that could revolutionize how global organizations approach cloud security. He mentioned that, as businesses and government agencies increasingly integrate advanced technologies into their operations, the need for comprehensive risk assessment and disaster recovery planning becomes paramount. This event has prompted many organizations to reassess their cybersecurity architectures and consider implementing more diverse and redundant security measures to prevent similar disruptions in the future. His AI-driven cloud security solution could significantly impact the financial and technology sectors worldwide, which have faced increasing cybersecurity challenges in recent years. The framework stands on four key pillars that address both current and future security concerns.\n\n\"The framework's quantum-resilient architecture and bio-inspired defense mechanisms are particularly relevant for financial institutions globally, which process millions of transactions daily,\" Sreejith quoted.\n\nQuantum-Resistant Architecture:\n\nThe first pillar focuses on quantum-resistant architecture, acknowledging the rising threat of quantum computing to traditional encryption methods. As quantum computers become more powerful, they could potentially break current cryptographic systems. Sreejith's framework implements quantum-resistant algorithms and protocols that can withstand attacks from both classical and quantum computers. This forward-looking approach is particularly vital for nations whose financial and technological sectors depend heavily on secure data transmission and storage.\n\nAI-Powered Predictive Maintenance:\n\nThe framework's second pillar revolutionizes cybersecurity through AI-powered predictive maintenance, marking a significant shift from traditional reactive approaches. This innovative system harnesses advanced machine learning algorithms to foresee and prevent security breaches before they materialize. At its core, the system operates like a digital sentinel, continuously monitoring and analyzing vast streams of network data. The AI engines process this information to detect subtle patterns, anomalies, and potential security weaknesses. By identifying these early warning signs, the system can predict probable attack vectors and security vulnerabilities with remarkable accuracy. When the AI detects concerning patterns or potential threats, it immediately alerts security teams, providing them with detailed insights and recommended actions. This proactive approach enables organizations to address vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them, effectively preventing breaches rather than merely responding to them. This predictive capability transforms cybersecurity from a reactive discipline into a proactive strategy, significantly reducing the risk of successful attacks.\n\nDecentralized Security Architecture:\n\nThe third pillar of Sreejith's framework centers on decentralized security architecture, a robust approach designed to eliminate vulnerabilities associated with centralized systems. Rather than concentrating security measures in a single location or system, this architecture strategically distributes security controls across multiple independent nodes and service providers. The architecture proves valuable for nations whose critical infrastructure relies heavily on digital networks. By implementing redundant security measures across different locations and providers, the system maintains its protective capabilities even if individual components fail or come under attack. This resilience is crucial in today's landscape where critical services must maintain continuous operation despite evolving cyber threats. The decentralized approach effectively transforms potential single points of failure into a robust, interconnected security ecosystem.\n\nSeamless Updates with Blue-Green Deployment:\n\nThe fourth pillar implements blue-green deployment strategies for system updates. This sophisticated approach enables organizations to implement security patches and upgrades without interrupting their operations. This approach operates by maintaining dual identical environments: while one actively serves users, the other undergoes updates and testing. Once verified, traffic will smoothly transition to the updated environment. This method proves invaluable for organizations needing to implement critical security patches and upgrades without operational disruption. The technique ensures continuous service availability while minimizing downtime risks, allowing businesses to maintain their security posture without compromising user experience or business continuity.\n\n\"By reducing system recovery time by 76%, we're addressing a critical concern for the banking sector where downtime can result in significant financial losses,\" Sreejith mentioned.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTogether, these four pillars create a comprehensive security framework that addresses both immediate and future challenges. The framework's strength lies in its holistic approach, combining cutting-edge technologies with practical deployment strategies. By implementing quantum-resistant protocols, AI-driven predictive systems, decentralized architecture, and efficient update mechanisms, organizations can build robust security systems that adapt to evolving threats while maintaining operational efficiency. Sreejith's proposals have demonstrated remarkable results, achieving a 92.4% success rate in predicting potential security failures. With governments and organizations placing a strong focus on cybersecurity and digital transformation, his research could play a crucial role in shaping a cyber-resilient future. As organizations increasingly rely on cloud-based solutions, this research proposal offers a promising path forward in creating a more secure and reliable digital infrastructure for the global community."

            "article_content": "The end of the year typically brings with it an emotional look back at the days gone by. For archaeologists, looking back into the past is pretty much an every day thing. That said, here are 10 of the most interesting archeological findings that Popular Science covered this year.\n\nNeanderthals and early humans intermingled Europe earlier\n\nStone tools from the Lincombian\u2013Ranisian\u2013Jerzmanowician (LRJ) culture uncovered at Ranis. Item 1 is a partial bifacial blade point characteristic of the LRJ. Item 2 also contains finely made bifacial leaf points. CREDITL \u00a9 Josephine Schubert, Museum Burg Ranis.\n\nIn January, a new genetic analysis of bone fragments from an archaeological site in central Germany found that modern humans had reached northern Europe 45,000 years ago. This new timeline means that their arrival overlapped with the Neanderthals who had been living there for several thousand years before going extinct. It also bolsters the theory that the movement of modern humans into Europe and Asia about 50,000 years ago helped drive Neanderthals into extinction. The findings were described in three separate papers published in the journals Nature and Nature Ecology and Evolution.\n\nMysterious Iron Age burials\n\nThe skeletal remains of a frog and a human were uncovered at Seminario Vescovile in Verona, Italy. CREDIT: S.R. Thompson/SABAP-VR/Laffranchi et al., 2024\n\nA team of archeologists from Italy and Switzerland found that animals buried alongside humans might have been intended to be a meal or companion in the afterlife. They also may have been part of a complex funeral rite during the Iron Age, according to their study published in February in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nOf the 161 people buried at the Seminario Vescovile site in Verona, Italy, 16 were buried alongside animals. Four of the people at this site were buried alongside the remains of dogs and/or horses. These animals were not commonly eaten and the presence of horses and dogs was significant to the team. Earlier Iron Age findings in France and Switzerland indicate that horses and dogs were symbolic at the time and were often present in what appears to be sacrificial rituals, funeral rites, and are frequently associated with specific deities from the time. For the team on this study, the characteristics of a plot called Burial 46 were particularly interesting.\n\n\u201cIt includes the complete skeleton of a horse positioned above a woman, along with the cranium of a dog and the remains of additional horses,\u201d Marco Milella, a co-author of the new study and anthropologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland, told Popular Science. \u201cThis discovery provides a glimpse into a remarkably complex funerary ritual. While drawing scientifically robust conclusions from just two cases is challenging, we are prompted to consider whether this occurrence is merely coincidental or indicative of a deeper pattern.\u201d\n\nAncient Maya ballcourts were for more than games\n\n\n\nA decorative ring made from carved stone is embedded in the wall of a ballcourt in the ancient Maya city of Chichen Itza in present day Mexico. CREDIT: LanaCanada.\n\n\n\nAncient Mayans may have made ceremonial offerings during the construction of the ballcourts that they used for sporting events. Advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis helped a team of scientists detect evidence of several plants that are known for both medicinal and religious purposes. The team found evidence of four different plants that are associated with ancient Maya medicine and divination rituals.\n\nThese microscopic fragments of ancient plants were found beneath the floor of a Mayan ballcourt in present day Mexico and collecting them was likely purposeful. The findings were described in a study published in the journal PLOS One in April.\n\nThe ball courts in this study were used for several ball games, including pok-a-tok. This combination of soccer and basketball is also undergoing a present day revival. Players likely tried to get a ball through a ring in a hoop affixed to a wall. Ballcourts were considered significant places within cities and even built near some of the largest temples, including in ancient Maya cities like Tikal in Guatemala.\n\n[Related: Tooth powder unlocks clues to an 800-year-old mystery of man thrown into well.]\n\nDecoding the Norton Disney Dodecaheadron\n\nThe dodecahedron on display at the National Civil War Centre, Newark Museum. CREDIT: Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group.\n\nIn the spring, the largest known Roman dodecahedron went on display in England.The cast bronze object was uncovered in the village of Norton Disney in the Midlands of eastern England It is hollow at its middle and roughly the size of a clenched fist and has 12 flat faces are shaped like pentagons. At roughly three inches tall and weighing half a pound, it is one of the largest of these strange Roman objects ever discovered.\n\nThe dodecahedron was sitting among the ruins of a Roman pit and was likely placed there about 1,700 years ago. It was found \u201cin situ,\u201d or deliberately placed among 4th Century CE Roman pottery in some sort of hole or quarry. More archeological excavation is needed to clarify exactly what this pit was used for.\n\n\u201cRoman society was full of superstition, something experienced on a daily basis,\u201d the Norton Disney History and Archaeology Group wrote in a statement. \u201cA potential link with local religious practice is our current working theory. More investigation is required though.\u201d\n\nArchaeology in space?\n\nA sample location in the starboard Maintenance Work Area of the International Space Station. The yellow dotted line indicates the boundaries of the sample area.

That didn\u2019t stop a team from California\u2019s Chapman University to see what they could find on the International Space Station (ISS). The team applied a traditional field strategy aboard the ISS for the first time. They applied the shovel test pit to analyze how the ever-changing \u201cmicrosociety\u201d aboard the ISS has adapted and changed over time.\n\nBack here on Earth, these projects typically involve digging small excavations at regular intervals across a site to gather information on how artifacts are distributed, then pick particularly promising pits for more thorough study. Since there really isn\u2019t anything to \u201cdig\u201d on the ISS, the team selected six locations throughout the space station and tasked astronauts to take daily photos of each space over roughly two months in 2022.\n\nTheir study published in August in the journal PLOS ONE identified 5,438 examples of \u201cartifacts\u201d including an augmented reality headset, Post-It notes, gloves, tools, and writing tools like Sharpie pens. While it is only an initial survey into this subject matter, it\u2019s the first of its kind to document how humans adapt to a novel environment completely removed from what we as a species evolved to handle.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

CREDIT: Professor Nick Pearce, Aberystwyth University, Picasa\n\nIn August, a new hypothesis for where Stonehenge\u2019s six-ton Altar Stone originated was published in the journal Nature. It likely originated 400 miles north in Scotland and not from Wales or other closer areas of southern England as scientists previously thought. This long trek points to the possibility that more advanced transportation methods and societal organization existed here about 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe Altar Stone is about 16 feet long and 19 inches thick and sits at the center of the circle. While it is not currently standing upright like the other stones, scientists are still uncertain if it stood vertically at some point. It arrived in the area sometime around 2,500 BCE, but its exact arrival date is still a mystery.\n\nChemical fingerprints within the grains matched rocks from northeast Scotland and were very different from Welsh bedrock. Specifically, with the age of the zircon minerals in the stone, the team is over 95 percent certain that it came all the way from northeastern Scotland.\n\nCheesy mummies\n\nTarim mummies from the present-day Xinjiang region of Northwestern China. CREDIT: Wenying Li\n\nAt least three embalmed bodies buried with some cheese on them were discovered at an ancient burial site in Xinjiang in northwestern China. The small lumps of fermented dairy, laid around the necks of the deceased, represent the longest-aged cheese ever discovered\u2013at roughly 3,500 years old.\n\nThe ancient cheese was incredibly well-preserved, but a new assessment of the chunks reveals some long-obsecured knowledge about human culture and a potential path for how dairy may have spread across Asia. The findings were published in the journal Cell in September.\n\nA new look at an Ancient Egyptian mummy\n\nLady Chenet-aa\u2019s mummy included artificial eyes to help her see in the afterlife. CREDIT: The Field Museum / Morgan Clark / Popular Science\n\nA team from Chicago\u2019s Field Museum used a CT scanner to determine Ancient Egyptian Lady Chenet-aa\u2019s burial procedure. Lady Chenet-aa lived roughly 3,000 years ago amid the 22nd Dynasty during Egypt\u2019s Third Intermediate Period. Soon after her death, one of the ways funerary experts prepared her for the afterlife was by constructing a cartonnage\u2014a paper mache-like box housing a deceased person\u2019s body.\n\nHowever, Chenet-aa\u2019s lacks any hint of a visible seam, leaving Egyptologists to wonder for years exactly how embalmers placed her inside the casing. Field Museum senior conservator JP Brown likened the mummy and its cartonnage coffin to a model ship inside a bottle.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly important that the inner coffin appeared whole and smooth without any external seams (unlike the outer coffin which was made of wood),\u201d Brown explained to Popular Science. \u201c\u2026 [and] if you look at the shape of cartonnage, the opening at the foot is too narrow for the mummy\u2019s shoulders to fit through.\u201d\n\nPompeii DNA tells a different story\n\nTwo of the plaster body casts from the Pompeii archaeological site. CREDIT: Archaeological Park of Pompei\n\nA new genetic analysis of 14 bodies recovered from Pompeii shed doubt on some of the initial interpretations of who these people were before the cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Using a new genomic analysis, a team of scientists found that their biological sexes and family relationships don\u2019t match up with the initial interpretations. The findings were published in November in the journal Current Biology.\n\nOne notable example is an adult wearing a golden bracelet found holding a child. This was traditionally interpreted to be a mother and child, but the new analysis found that it was an unrelated adult male and child. Additionally, a pair believed to be sisters or mother and daughter, included one genetic male.\n\n[Related: Focaccia likely originated in Mesopotamia, not Rome.]\n\nNeanderthals also loved to collect things\n\nThese marine fossils were found in a Neanderthal cave site, but aren\u2019t native to the area. CREDIT: Quaternary\n\nThe act of collecting objects may stretch at least as far back as our Neanderthal ancestry, according to relics uncovered in a cave in Iberia, Spain.\n\nAn archeological team analyzed 15 small marine fossils found in the fourth level of the Prado Vargas Cave system. While one artifact showed physical evidence of use as a hammer, the other 14 fossils displayed no obvious physical wear or utilitarian value. Additional evidence in the caves also points to the site serving as a semi-permanent Neanderthal encampment likely used for toolmaking, hunting, or perhaps even ritualistic activities.\n\nEarlier research shows Neanderthals engaged in cultural rituals such as ornamental crafting, cave wall art, and even familial and social funeral burials. Due to these rituals, experts argue that it stands to reason the human ancestors likely participated in pastimes such as collecting items they thought were interesting or special in some way.\n\nMaking clothes fit for the ice age\n\nMicro-CT scans of bone needle and needle specimens and the species they were compared with. CREDIT: Pelton et al., 2024, PLOS ONE\n\nIn November, a team in Wyoming proposed the idea that Paleolithic North Americans likely made needles using the bones of foxes, hares, rabbits, bobcats, mountain lions, lynx, and even the now-extinct American cheetah.\n\nBone needles like the ones from this study are common during this period in the North American archaeological record because sewing complex weather garments for freezing weather was a necessity in response to the cold climate shift brought on by the last ice age. There has been little direct evidence of such garments, but bone needles and the bones of the fur-bearing animals used to make pelts provide some indirect evidence of this early tailoring.\n\n\u201cThey were complex garments fringed with the furs of red fox, hare, and cat, some of which with feet still attached as is common among modern trappers,\u201d study co-author and Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton told Popular Science. \u201cThey were likely comparable to similar garments worn by the Inuit, able to withstand the cold and windy conditions of Wyoming\u2019s last Ice Age.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Northwestern University engineers made a remarkable advance in quantum computing and communication, demonstrating quantum teleportation over a standard fiber optic cable that already carries everyday Internet traffic.\n\nThis development shows that quantum communication might not require dedicated lines, which clears the path for easier and more widespread integration of quantum and classical data sharing.\n\nPath for quantum networking\n\nThe news centers around the idea that quantum signals \u2014 information carried by delicate particles of light known as photons \u2014 can travel alongside everyday Internet traffic without losing their integrity.\n\n\n\nThis breakthrough demonstrates quantum teleportation, a process where the state of a particle (like a photon) is transferred to another distant particle without the initial particle moving physically.\n\nScience behind quantum teleportation\n\nBy using entangled photons, this method enables secure, near-instantaneous data sharing and paves the way for future quantum networks.\n\nThe research team successfully tested a setup that allows quantum information to weave through the bustling flow of regular Internet data without interference.\n\nThis achievement overcomes one of the biggest hurdles in making quantum networks a practical reality.\n\nPrem Kumar, who oversaw the research, is a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Northwestern\u2019s McCormick School of Engineering.\n\nHe is known for his contributions to quantum communication and serves as the director of the Center for Photonic Communication and Computing.\n\n\n\nIn their recent work, Kumar and his collaborators introduce a new way of thinking about quantum signals alongside their classical counterparts.\n\nEntanglement in quantum communication\n\nQuantum teleportation stands out because it uses entanglement as a way to exchange information without physically sending matter across a distance. The concept traces back to Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in 1935.\n\n\n\nScientists have since tested quantum entanglement in labs, culminating in the formal proposal for quantum teleportation in 1993.\n\nOne of the biggest appeals of quantum teleportation is that it can occur almost as fast as light travels. Photons can become entangled so that performing a measurement on one instantaneously affects its partner, no matter how far away it is.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is incredibly exciting because nobody thought it was possible; our work shows a path towards next-generation quantum and classical networks sharing a unified fiberoptic infrastructure. Basically, it opens the door to pushing quantum communications to the next level,\u201d enthused Kumar.\n\nProtecting delicate photons\n\nSecuring a clear route for single photons involves more than just adding them to an active cable. Ordinary Internet traffic typically relies on millions of light particles, so a handful of quantum photons can easily get lost or overwhelmed.\n\n\n\nThe Northwestern team performed detailed studies on how light scatters inside the cable to see if there was a specific wavelength that experiences less clutter.\n\nThey pinpointed that sweet spot and added special filters to reduce the noise generated by normal data traffic.\n\n\u201cQuantum teleportation has the ability to provide quantum connectivity securely between geographically distant nodes,\u201d said Kumar.\n\n\n\nPast work suggested that large-scale quantum networks might need specialized systems. Now, his findings reveal that this might not be strictly necessary, if signals are positioned in just the right place in the spectrum.\n\nFirst test run in busy channels\n\nEarlier demonstrations of quantum teleportation typically involved pristine settings or dedicated fibers.\n\nSome researchers believed that real-world cables, teeming with signals, would smother the faint quantum light. That assumption has been proven wrong.\n\nIn tests at Northwestern, the researchers ran quantum signals and classical communications over the same fiber optic cable without them colliding.\n\nThey measured how well the quantum information arrived at its destination and confirmed that it was still correct at the other end.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur work shows a path towards next-generation quantum and classical networks,\u201d Kumar summarized.\n\nReal-world infrastructure\n\nThe immediate plan is to scale the system to longer runs and then transition to underground fiber connections.\n\nThe group believes that an eventual shift to real-world cables could be next. Building on single-pair teleportation, they also want to experiment with multiple pairs of entangled photons to achieve another crucial step known as entanglement swapping.\n\nIf that milestone is reached, quantum networks could begin to take shape across regions rather than only between two points.\n\n\n\nFor critical operations in finance, defense, and data management, such networks could offer more secure connections thanks to the inherent secrecy of quantum methods, where any tampering is immediately noticeable.\n\nBroader applications\n\nThe capacity to support quantum connections without setting up special cables makes many new ideas more viable.\n\nDistributed quantum computing, which relies on linking multiple quantum computers in different locations, would be simpler to establish.\n\nDistance-sensing tasks and advanced metrology could also benefit from more stable quantum links.\n\nEven beyond computing, quantum networks have the potential to spur new technologies in encryption, imaging, and fundamental physics experiments.\n\n\n\nResearchers have also discussed using quantum entanglement to synchronize distant clocks or to share random numbers for cryptography at unprecedented levels of security.\n\nSignificance of quantum teleportation\n\nQuantum teleportation has matured from a fascinating theory to a tool that is becoming more practical.\n\nWhile it is never straightforward to integrate delicate quantum signals, the Northwestern group\u2019s accomplishment raises confidence that such integration is within reach.\n\nMany experts have believed that building specialized infrastructure was an unavoidable cost of quantum networking.\n\nAccording to Kumar\u2019s report, if wavelengths are picked carefully, classical signals and quantum information can coexist just fine. This line of thinking spares organizations from installing entire new grids of cables.\n\nFuture work on quantum teleportation\n\nIn upcoming work, the researchers plan to expand the scope of their approach in longer segments to confirm that the method remains stable as cables stretch far past the lab. They will also design a multi-node demonstration to verify it can handle more than a single link.\n\n\n\nThere is much excitement that existing communication channels, once tuned just right, could carry quantum data to distant points.\n\nWith such possibilities on the horizon, quantum teleportation may shift from a theoretical concept to a tool that transforms communication.\n\nThe future might see quantum and classical networks working side by side in ways that once sounded unlikely.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Optica.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "Home Opinion 2024: The year the tide turned on radical gender ideology\n\nWhat is a woman? This is the question that was posed by U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn to then-nominee for the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, during her Supreme Court confirmation hearings. By not providing a simple answer based on basic biology and instead deflecting to the role of an impartial judge, Jackson revealed something that contributed to the turning point regarding transgender ideology that we have witnessed in 2024.\n\nAs a woman herself, no one reasonably thinks Justice Jackson is unable to offer a definition of what constitutes a woman. But feeling the need to avoid responding in a direct fashion was a signal that Jackson, personally in that moment, had prioritized bowing to the bizarre and ever-changing cultural definitions of gender instead of a straightforward acknowledgement of what we all know to be true about the two sexes.\n\nFor many Americans, that a judge who is supposed to make decisions based on reality and facts would shy away from that in an answer, was the latest example of just how far down the path of insanity our culture had strayed\u2014and they wanted no more of it. This is especially the case as it relates to children.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Subscribe\n\nThe 2024 election was seen by many as a chance to make a national statement about changing direction. And for a large portion of voters, President Trump represented the change they were seeking. An astounding 70% of Concerned Women of America exit poll participants said \u201cTrump\u2019s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls and women\u2019s sports and of trans boys and men using girls and women\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d was an important issue for them when voting.\n\nBut to simply read this dynamic shift in the last two years through a political lens is to miss the ways the tide has turned for parents, within families, and in communities\u2014both here in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nA quick glance at the state of today\u2019s youth reveals a troubling picture: a mental health crisis exacerbated by social media overuse; rising rates of depression, particularly among teenage girls; and a deepening sense of alienation among young men, sometimes culminating in violent outbursts. These challenges are compounded by cultural shifts catalyzed by the sexual revolution\u2014shifts that push the fictional narrative that a boy can become a girl and vice versa.\n\nFor decades, this progressive ideological push seemed unstoppable, especially for children. Yet, this year has brought a surprising and significant pushback, suggesting a return to biological reality is in order.\n\nIn April, the Cass Review, a study commissioned by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service, delivered a damning critique of puberty blockers and gender transition surgeries for children. The report highlighted the lack of scientific evidence supporting these practices, and its findings were affirmed across the political spectrum in the U.K. The fallout was swift, with U.K. policymakers reassessing the medical and ethical implications of such interventions.\n\nLater this year, the controversy surrounding trans-identifying biological males competing in women\u2019s sports came to the forefront in the United States. San Jose State\u2019s volleyball team was credited with multiple forfeit victories after teams in the Mountain West Conference boycotted games against them for including a biological male who identifies as female. This incident underscored the tensions and practical challenges of enforcing fairness in sports under the banner of gender inclusivity.\n\nIn December, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in United States v. Skrmetti, a case centered on a Tennessee law banning gender transition \u201ctreatments\u201d for minors. Tennessee is one of 26 states to enact such legislation, citing insufficient scientific support for these interventions and evidence of significant harm. While predicting a result based on oral arguments is often a fool\u2019s errand, a majority of justices appeared reluctant to overturn Tennessee\u2019s ban and instead may recognize the importance of the state\u2019s role in protecting children from harm.\n\nFinally, just a week ago, the U.K. extended its prohibition on the sale of puberty blockers for minors, with a legislative review set for 2027. This marks yet another step in the growing global resistance to radical gender ideology.\n\nWithout a doubt, our society remains largely libertine, adhering to the belief that \u201cas long as it doesn\u2019t harm anyone, anything goes.\u201d However, the question of harm \u2014particularly when it comes to children \u2014is now being scrutinized more closely. Though I would articulate my objections about transgender ideology for any age or for any context, it\u2019s one thing for adults to subject themselves to radical \u201ctreatments;\u201d it\u2019s another thing entirely when that is forced upon innocent children \u2014and asking society at large to just acquiesce to this.\n\n\n\nWhen children undergo these radical \u201ctreatments,\u201d the harmful effects spread to how we interact and live with one another. When a teenage girl loses her spot on the podium because she\u2019s competing against a biological male in a swimming meet; or when a child comes home and describes his interaction with a child of a different gender in the locker room; or when a mom feels unsafe in a restroom facility at the mall, what might feel abstract or distant becomes deeply personal when it impacts one\u2019s own family.\n\nThe key, however, is not merely to critique what is wrong but to present a positive and hopeful vision. Christians can point to the beauty of the family and a perspective that respects the God-created natural distinctions between male and female, that values the body as an integral part of personhood, and that sees human sexuality as a reflection of divine intent rather than personal whim. And we can do this even while acknowledging some individuals may feel a disconnect about how they perceive themselves. They are in need of support and care, not extreme experimentations that so often lead to destructive results\u2014for them personally and people around them.\n\nIf 2024 has taught us anything, it is that cultural change is possible. The backlash against radical gender ideology suggests that people are hungry for a better story\u2014one that affirms their worth, their bodies, and their God-given identity."
