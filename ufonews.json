And exactly that colour.\n\n\"Appeared and disappeared like alternating.\"\n\n\"Alien invasion before January 20,\" another said, noting the date of Donald Trump's inauguration into the White House.\n\nOne just simply posted an alien emoji.\n\nBut, others, including UFO experts, have started doubting this theory.\n\nAvi Loeb, a theoretical physician, cosmologist and Harvard professor believes the so-called flying orb is part of the camera.\n\nMoment UFOs appear in sky above Spain next to rainbow - before floods hit\n\nHe told the New York Post: \"This is most likely an optical artefact from the helicopter glass in front of the camera.\n\n\"Namely a bright spot from the reflection of sunlight as the camera gradually changes its orientation relative to the sun and the ground.\n\n\"But even if it was a real object, the apparent speed is of an order the speed of sound and not extraordinary.\"\n\nThis is a theory many other viewers of the video came up with.\n\nFAMOUS UFO INCIDENTS The \u2018Night of the UFOs\u2019 is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years. Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' \u2013 which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object \"shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet\". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana\u2019s Malmstrom Air Force Base. US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two \"ball of light\" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.\n\n\"A helicopter with blue water, blue sky and glass buildings reflecting off of it,\" one wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"Lens flare zooming past NYC accidentally caught on film by local news chopper,\" another said on X.\n\nOthers claimed it could have been a drone or a balloon.\n\n\"Maybe somebody\u2019s private drone was made to look like something else,\" one viewer suggested.\n\n\"That makes the most sense if it\u2019s not a balloon.\"\n\nA representative from the local news channel that filmed the clip told the Post that they do not know when the footage was recorded but confirmed it had not been edited.\n\nAnother source from the news outlet claimed that it was a drone that appeared to be moving at high speeds due to that of the chopper.\n\nEarlier this month, Congress heard a Pentagon whistleblower's bombshell testimony at a major hearing about UFO cases."

CoAgent\u2019s Agentic Generative UI creates dynamic, AI-generated interfaces that adapt to user needs and agent outputs, providing visibility into the agent\u2019s state and building trust.\n\nIf you like the features stated earlier, you might want to consider using CoAgents for your business, let us see how to do that.\n\nBuild AI CoAgents or apps powered by Copilot\n\nFollow the steps below to build AI CoAgents or apps powered by Copilot.\n\nInstall CopilotKit Configure Remote Backend Endpoint Add LangGraph agent\n\nLet us talk about them in detail.\n\n1] Install CopilotKit\n\nBefore we begin with CoAgents, we need to first install CopilotKit on your device. We are presumming that you have already installed Node.js and npm on your computer and have created a folder for React applications, however, the last part is optional for this step. CopilotKit uses an open source LLM model, in this tutorial we will be using OpenAI API key. Without further ado, let\u2019s get started.\n\nOpen Windows Terminal and go to the location where you have created the React app using cd (change directory) command.\n\ncd C:\\React\\myapplication\n\nNow, run the following command.\n\nnpm install @copilotkit/react-core @copilotkit/react-ui @copilotkit/runtime\n\nThen, execute the command mentioned below to install OpenAI.\n\nnpm install openai\n\nIn your project, go to the .eve file, it will be located in the root, and add the following line.\n\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n\nAfter making changes to the file, we recommend you navigate to docs.copilot.ai/quickstart to know how to configure the End Point and configure CopilotKit provider in your project.\n\n2] Configure Remote Backend Endpoint\n\nIn order to integrate Python-based services (or any other Node.js alternative), we have to connect Copilot app to a Remote Backend endpoint. To do that, let us first install Copilot dependencies in Windows Terminal using the following query.\n\npip install copilotkit fastapi uvicorn --extra-index-url https://copilotkit.gateway.scarf.sh/simple/\n\nNow, we need to setup FastAI server, to do that, run the commands mentioned below.\n\nmkdir my_copilotkit_remote_endpoint\n\ncd my_copilotkit_remote_endpoint\n\necho. > server.py\n\nIf the echo didn\u2019t work, you can open the folder in Visual Studio Code, and then create server.py file.\n\nOpen the server.py file in VSCode and then paste the following lines of code.\n\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n\nNow, go back to Windows Terminal and install FastAPI and Uvicorn.\n\npip install fastapi uvicorn\n\nOnce you are done with that, go to docs.copilot.ai guides to learn more.\n\n3] Add LangGraph agent\n\nNext up, we need to integrate LangGraph agent to the server.py file. First, locate the CopilotKitSDK instance within your Python Remote Endpoint, usually found in server.py. Next, adjust the CopilotKitSDK instance (established in the preceding step) to accommodate LangGraph agents. You need to add the following lines of code.\n\nagents=[ LangGraphAgent( name=\"basic_agent\", description=\"Agent that answers questions about the weather\", graph=the_langraph_graph, # copilotkit_config={ # if you use Google Gemini, uncomment this code (and import `copilotkit_messages_to_langchain`, see above) # \"convert_messages\": copilotkit_messages_to_langchain(use_function_call=True) # } ) ],\n\nThis should be enclosed under CopilotKitSDK tag.\n\nTo know more, we recommend you follow the guide mentioned in docs.copilotkit.ai/coagents.\n\nRead: What are best free AI Extensions for Visual Studio Code?\n\nHow do I build my own Copilot?\n\nTo create a new copilot, go to the Copilot Studio home page (at /copilotstudio.microsoft.com) and select Create in the left navigation, then choose the Copilots page. Alternatively, you can select + New copilot on the Copilots page. Use the chat to describe your copilot, guided by the provided questions, or select Skip to configure and fill out the form. Finally, select \u201cCreate\u201d to complete the process.\n\nRead: Best AI tools for Developers\n\nCan Copilot generate code?\n\nYes, Copilot can generate code. However, it can not be perfect; there can be multiple glitches and bugs. Therefore, one should not integrate the code provided by any AI chatbot without thorough manual inspections. You can use Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in Edge, the built-in app or use GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio using extension.\n\nAlso Read: Use Copilot to Refractor Code."

Johns Hopkins University\n\nCarbon-dated tombs were uncovered at the site, featuring six skeletons as well as gold and silver jewelry, cookware, weapons and pottery. The team also discovered four clay cylinders containing a form of alphabetic print.\n\nThe clay objects \u2014 about the length of a finger \u2014 were perforated, and Schwartz believes they were strung together during their use and operated as an ancient label.\n\n\u201cMaybe they detail the contents of a vessel, or maybe where the vessel came from, or who it belonged to,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout a means to translate the writing, we can only speculate.\u201d\n\nThe Syrian region is about 875 miles north of the great pyramids of Giza, where ancient Egyptians used hieroglyphics as written communication at least 500 years later.\n\n3 Researchers suspect the clay writing was used as a label. jhu\n\nJust south of Syria in modern-day Lebanon around the 11th century BC, the Phonecians \u2014 from whom the English word \u201cphonics\u201d derives \u2014 are credited with creating \u201cthe prototype for all alphabets in the world,\u201d according to UNESCO.\n\n\u201cAnd this new discovery shows that people were experimenting with new communication technologies much earlier and in a different location than we had imagined before now,\u201d said Schwartz."

Whether you living in a walkable city, have a vacation coming up or just need a new everyday walking shoe, a solid sneaker will never be wasted space in your closet. And, with all of the early Black Friday sales going on right now, one of our favorite comfortable shoe brands is getting on in the action: Save 30% on absoltely everything during Allbirds' Black Friday sale.\n\nWe're big fans of the Allbirds Tree Runners, which we tested for ourselves and found to be \"as comfy as a pair of socks.\" Even celebrities such as Blake Lively, Cindy Crawford, Hilary Duff, Kate Hudson and Jennifer Garner have been spotted about town over the years in their Allbirds.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the brand, Allbirds sells a range of men's and women's sneakers in a variety of styles, but the Tree Runners are its best sellers, with more than 11,000 reviews on the Allbirds website alone.

And if company missions and sustainable production methods are important to you, you'll be pleased to know that the company, which was founded in 2014, actually earns its stripes as a sustainable B-corp business by making its sneakers from 75% naturally sourced and recycled materials.\n\nPerhaps best of all, however, is that Allbirds' shoes are easy to care for. Simply remove the shoe laces and/or insoles, toss them in a delicates bag in the wash, run them on a gentle cycle and let them air dry. Because they're made with wool and natural materials, you don't want to toss them in the dryer. They'll return to their natural shape after a wear or two. Hand wash the laces and insoles for best results.\n\nAnd while all of those perks might make you think these comfy shoes cost a pretty penny, we're pleased to say that they aren't actually overwhelmingly pricey \u2014 especially when you catch them on a rare discount like during Black Friday.
