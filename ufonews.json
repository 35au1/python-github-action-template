        "article_content": "DONALD Trump has been challenged to \"change history forever\" and come clean about UFO intel if he makes a stunning return to the White House this week.\n\nArizona-based expert Nick Pope says there is growing hope within the global UFO community that if Trump returns for a second term, he will push through an executive order to have several classified files released.\n\n5 Donald Trump, pictured on his golf course in Scotland in 2013, has been challenged to release any UFO secrets the government has Credit: Getty\n\n5 Recent whistleblower revelations suggested the White House created a special program to track UFO sightings called the Immaculate Constellation Credit: Getty\n\n5 UFO expert Nick Pope spoke about his hopes of finally seeing revelatory documents released that he believes could change history forever Credit: News Nation Now/On Balance with Leland Vittert\n\nHe also believes the recent whistleblower revelation that the US Government has created an \"active and highly secretive\" tracking program called the Immaculate Constellation could spark Trump's divulgation of critical information about the potential presence of other lifeforms.\n\nSECRET REVELATIONS\n\nQuizzed about his views on UFOs during his recent interview on Joe Rogan's podcast, Trump said he was told \"a lot.\"\n\nPope, who used to work for a British Government department investigating the mysterious phenomenon that has enthralled believers for decades, is adamant the former president has been fully briefed and \"is being cautious about what to disclose.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s a strong belief that the US government knows something concrete and might release it, particularly if Trump regains office,\" Pope excitedly told The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"Many see Trump as a disruptor and a populist, less beholden to the deep state or career bureaucrats. Unlike other politicians, he could potentially push for full disclosure.\"\n\nTrump has previously revealed, during an interview with his son, Donald Jr., that \"he knows a few things\" but had to be careful with the information.\n\nPope believes Trump is also determined to release the JFK files, which have similarly been shrouded in secrecy as the conspiracy theories over the infamous 1963 assassination continue to swirl.\n\n\"He\u2019s already promised total transparency on JFK if re-elected, so it\u2019s reasonable to think he might do the same with UFOs,\" the expert continued.\n\n\"SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS\"\n\nA whistleblower linked to the Immaculate Constellation case, described as \"a current or former US government official,\" has allegedly written a report with significant claims.\n\nIt alleges that the US executive branch has been addressing issues related to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and non-human intelligence (NHI) without Congressional knowledge, oversight, or authorization.\n\nWill Trump or Harris FINALLY reveal the truth about America\u2019s alien secrets? UFO expert says one candidate will tell all\n\nThis situation, the report claims, may have persisted for decades.\n\nThere are also detailed descriptions of several UFO encounters logged in a government database.\n\nOne incident involved an F-22 fighter jet being \"intercepted and boxed in\" by a group of three to six spherical objects, which ultimately forced the jet to leave its mission area.\n\nIn another reported encounter, the crew aboard a Navy aircraft carrier observed a sphere glowing orange-red with a surface that seemed to be \u201croiling like the sun.\u201d\n\nThis object descended rapidly from a high altitude, stopping to hover approximately 100-200 yards (90-180 meters) above the flight deck.\n\nJournalist Michael Shellenberger claimed he had communicated with the alleged whistleblower.\n\nHowever, identifying information, such as the exact role and gender, was being withheld to protect them from retaliation.\n\nFRESH HOPES\n\nIf Trump does indeed defeat Kamala Harris and return to the Washington DC hot seat, Pope is hoping access will be granted for \"clearer, longer videos of UFO sightings\" as well as underwater tracking data, which insiders believe is also present.\n\nFootage from military surveillance systems could also be released.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot we haven\u2019t seen from the military\u2019s surveillance systems,\" Pope continued.\n\n\"For example, the recent Chinese spy balloon was followed by other ambiguous shoot-downs, yet the government cited national security concerns as reasons for not releasing clear images.\n\n\"But soon after, they released clear photos of a Russian aircraft near a U.S. drone. This kind of inconsistency frustrates the UFO community, and we expect that a new administration might change this stance.\"\n\nAllan Lichtman's 2024 presidential election prediction Renowned historian Allan Lichtman has accurately predicted the outcomes of presidential elections since 1984 using his 13 Keys to the White House algorithm. In 2016, he was one of the few scholars who correctly predicted a Trump win. This year, has revealed who he thinks will be inaugurated as the 47th president in January next year based on his system of true and false statements. If six or more statements go against the White House party, they are projected to lose the presidential election. Midterm elections: The Democrats suffered losses in the 2022 House elections, meaning the key turns false. (Harris 0-1 Trump) There is no primary contest: This key turns in favor of Harris because the Democrats got \"smart\" and rallied behind the vice president after Joe Biden ended his campaign, according to Lichtman. (Harris 1-1 Trump) The sitting president is seeking another term: This turns false because Biden suspended his re-election campaign. (Harris 1-2 Trump) There is no third-party challenger: This statement is true because third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. needed to poll at 10% nationally, according to Lichtman. (Harris 2-2 Trump) The short-term economy is strong: This key goes in favor of the White House Party. (Harris 3-2 Trump) The long-term economic growth has been as good as the last two terms: This key also swings toward Harris. (Harris 4-2 Trump) The White House Party has made major national policy changes: This key is also true, according to Lichtman's theory. (Harris 5-2 Trump) There is sustained social unrest during the term: College campus demonstrations have erupted in reaction to the Gaza conflict, but no protests have broken out that threaten the fabric of society. This means the key goes in Harris' column. (Harris 6-2 Trump) The White House is untainted by scandal: Despite House Republican efforts to impeach Joe Biden, they have been unable to pin a scandal on him. (Harris 7-2 Trump) The incumbent is charismatic: Harris is not considered a Ronald Reagan or Franklin D. Roosevelt-like figure so the key is false. (Harris 7-3 Trump) The challenger is uncharismatic: This key goes in favor of the White House party - even though Trump is a showman. (Harris 8-3 Trump) Lichtman warned that the two foreign policy keys - whether there has been a major success or no failure - could flip either way. But, even if both statements flipped against Harris, Trump would not have enough keys in his column to win the election.\n\nInterest in possible extraterrestrial activity from political parties isn't new.\n\nMarco Rubio and Tim Burchett have pushed for transparency in the past, while Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Coretz and Kirsten Gillibrand have also voiced interest.\n\nUFO fanatic Robert Bigelow has donated millions to Republican campaigns over the years.\n\nHISTORY CHANGER\n\nPope, however, believes a maverick like Trump \"could make a real change\" and push ahead with some seriously stunning revelations.\n\n\"Some feel he\u2019s polarizing, but still hope he might follow through on disclosure promises,\" the expert admitted.\n\n\"People would remember where they were when it happened, much like they remember moments associated with JFK,\" Pope continued.\n\n\"And if there\u2019s a backstory, such as humanity\u2019s origins being linked to extraterrestrials, it could fundamentally alter worldviews, even presenting darker possibilities\u2014that Earth might be a science experiment, prison, or farm, theories that would undoubtedly provoke significant shifts in understanding.\n\n\"The President who discloses alien existence would change history forever.\"\n\n5 UFO expert Nick Pope told The U.S. Sun he believes Trump is a \"disruptor\" who will come clean about what the government knows about UFOs Credit: Getty"

        "article_content": "Meta is also doing the same in UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. has granted approval for US government agencies and defence contractors to use its AI models, opening the door for Meta's technology to play a key role in military and national security efforts.\n\nThe Facebook-parent company is making its large language models, called Llama, available to more than a dozen US agencies and contractors, including Lockheed Martin Corp., Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc.\n\nWhile Meta's AI models are open source, meaning they are free for developers to use, the company's \"acceptable use policy\" forbids people from using them on any projects related to \"military, warfare, nuclear industries or applications, [and] espionage,\" among other things.\n\nBut Meta is making an exception for US defence agencies and their contractors as it works to expand its reach in the public sector and increase Llama's foothold in the burgeoning AI arms race.\n\n\"As an American company, and one that owes its success in no small part to the entrepreneurial spirit and democratic values the United States upholds, Meta wants to play its part to support the safety, security and economic prosperity of America - and of its closest allies too,\" wrote Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, in a blog post Monday.\n\nMeta is also making Llama available to similar government agencies and contractors in the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, a spokesperson confirmed. Those nations have an intelligence-sharing partnership known as Five Eyes.\n\nIsrael, the closest US ally in the Middle East, was not included on the current list of partners.\n\nThe move comes on the eve of the US election and at a time when Meta faces some concerns about the potential of developers in countries like China to use Llama for military applications.\n\nLarge language models are the foundation of the current AI boom and can be used for a variety of services, including powering chatbots. In the world of defence and security, Llama could help with tasks like data analysis and synthesizing documents, or to \"track terrorist financing or strengthen our cyber defences,\" Clegg wrote.\n\nMeta will not have a say in how US agencies or its partners use the Llama technology, but a Meta spokesperson said via email that \"it is the responsibility of countries leveraging AI for national security to deploy AI ethically, responsibly, and in accordance with relevant international law.\"\n\nMeta's motivation to work with US defence agencies is driven in part by its intention to further establish Llama as a dominant foundation for AI products globally. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg made Llama open source because he wants to have more control over the next major technological wave - a strategy that only works if Meta's technology is ubiquitous.\n\nOn earnings call last week, Zuckerberg said he was trying to get \"the public sector to adopt Llama across the US government.\" The latest update could help with that goal and also pave the way for Zuckerberg to further develop relationships with elected officials.\n\nMeta has been criticized over the years for its role in policing user speech and an alleged failure to protect young people online. Former President Donald Trump has taken several shots at Zuckerberg in recent months, even suggesting he might try and put the Meta founder in jail if he is re-elected to the White House.\n\nMeta is also framing its decision to work with US defence agencies as a way of preventing US adversaries, like China, from gaining ground. \"We believe it is in both America and the wider democratic world's interest for American open-source models to excel and succeed over models from China and elsewhere,\" Clegg wrote.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"

Each investigator hails from a different part of Texas but shares a profound curiosity for the paranormal.\n\nAngela Kaatz, is the CEO of the group, she says she can feel and hear spirits. Originally from Dayton, Texas, Angela recalled her first encounter with a spirit at just three years old. Growing up in a haunted house, Angela and her daughter have shared multiple eerie encounters, including the sighting of a mysterious woman in a white robe.\n\nIssa Medina, from Manvel, Texas, grew up in a family that strongly believes in the supernatural. Her paranormal journey began early, with sightings of shadow figures that led her family to bless their home. Known for her deep connection to spirits, Issa has led the team to some of the Houston area\u2019s most active locations, including the haunted Hotel Grand Galvez, Wundertlich Farm, Montgomery Oaks Antique Shop, and the former Spaghetti Warehouse.\n\nGenny Murphy, born in New Jersey and now a proud Texan, is a self-proclaimed scaredy-cat. When not managing her nonprofit dog rescue with 16 dogs, she dives into ghost hunting with humor and enthusiasm. One of her most chilling experiences happened at La Carafe, a historic bar in Houston where she and her team members heard children\u2019s whispers and saw doors mysteriously close.\n\nRounding out the team is Lisa Gallo Roth, a skeptic from Galveston who now lives in Clearlake. Lisa remains cautious but intrigued by the paranormal. Her most notable experience came at the New Orleans Pharmacy Museum, where she encountered a setting she had seen only in recurring dreams.\n\nArmed with high-tech paranormal devices such as EMF meters, REM pods, spirit music boxes, and the light-sensitive Boo Bear, The Ghost Hunting Beauties delve into each investigation with both excitement and a hint of trepidation. They encounter both friendly and less-welcoming spirits, sharing their findings on their popular YouTube channel and partnering with professional paranormal experts to deepen their investigations.\n\nThis team continues to bring haunted Texas history to life with every investigation, reminding viewers that, in some places, the past is very much alive."

Join us as we dive into the heartbeat of Boston\u2019s entrepreneurial ecosystem and uncover what truly makes its startup culture so distinctive!\n\nHistory and Development of Boston\u2019s Startup Scene\n\nBoston\u2019s startup scene has deep roots that trace back to the early stages of American innovation. In the late 20th century, universities like MIT and Harvard became incubators for groundbreaking ideas. Their research spurred technological advancements, laying a solid foundation for entrepreneurship.\n\nThe dot-com boom in the 1990s marked a pivotal moment. It drew attention and investment to Boston\u2019s burgeoning tech sector. This era showcased local talent and attracted venture capitalists eager to fund ambitious projects.\n\nAs biotech emerged as another key player, Boston carved out its niche within this industry. The synergy between life sciences and technology fostered collaboration across various sectors.\n\nToday, established companies coexist with startups in an ever-evolving landscape. Networking events proliferate, while accelerators provide essential support for emerging entrepreneurs. The growth continues as new generations push boundaries and redefine what\u2019s possible in business.\n\nKey Elements of Boston\u2019s Startup Culture\n\nBoston\u2019s startup culture thrives on a few key elements that set it apart.\n\nAccess to funding is vital. With numerous venture capital firms and angel investors in the area, startups can secure the financial backing they need to grow. This influx of capital fuels innovation and drives ambitious projects.\n\nThe collaborative environment enhances creativity. Entrepreneurs often connect at meetups, co-working spaces, or local events. Sharing ideas fosters growth and helps refine concepts.\n\nProximity to elite universities like MIT and Harvard creates a rich talent pool. Students and graduates bring fresh perspectives, making Boston an incubator for new ideas.\n\nSupportive government initiatives also play a role. Local programs promote entrepreneurship through grants, mentorships, and networking opportunities tailored specifically for startups.\n\nThese elements combine to create an ecosystem where innovation flourishes continuously across various industries.\n\n\u2013 Access to Funding and Resources\n\nBoston boasts a vibrant financial landscape that\u2019s crucial for startups. Venture capital firms are abundant, eager to invest in innovative ideas and promising entrepreneurs. This influx of funding creates an ecosystem where new businesses can thrive.\n\nAngel investors also play a significant role here. They provide the early-stage support that many startups desperately need to get off the ground. Their willingness to take risks helps fuel creativity and innovation across various sectors.\n\nBeyond traditional funding routes, Boston offers numerous accelerators and incubators. These programs not only provide financial backing but also invaluable mentorship and networking opportunities. Startups gain access to workshops, resources, and guidance from seasoned professionals who understand the challenges ahead.\n\nMoreover, local banks and community organizations frequently host events aimed at connecting founders with potential investors. The collaborative spirit ensures that entrepreneurs have multiple avenues to secure the necessary resources for their ventures.\n\n\u2013 Collaborative Environment\n\nBoston\u2019s startup scene thrives on collaboration. Entrepreneurs and innovators often come together to share ideas, resources, and experiences.\n\nCoworking spaces fill the city, buzzing with creativity. These hubs encourage networking and partnerships among diverse startups. Here, connections are made over coffee or during brainstorming sessions.\n\nMeetups and events happen regularly. They provide platforms for founders to showcase their work while learning from others in similar journeys. This culture of openness fosters a sense of community that feels unique to Boston.\n\nMentorship also plays a key role. Seasoned entrepreneurs willingly offer guidance to newcomers, helping them navigate challenges in an ever-evolving market landscape.\n\nThis collaborative spirit not only drives innovation but also strengthens relationships within the ecosystem. As startups support one another, they cultivate a climate rich with opportunity and growth potential.\n\n\u2013 Proximity to Top Universities and Talent Pool\n\nBoston boasts some of the world\u2019s leading universities, creating a vibrant ecosystem for startups. Institutions like Harvard, MIT, and Boston University are not just academic powerhouses; they produce a steady stream of skilled graduates eager to innovate.\n\nThese schools foster an entrepreneurial spirit through programs that encourage students to explore their ideas. Incubators and accelerators affiliated with these universities often provide crucial support for budding entrepreneurs.\n\nAdditionally, many professors engage in research that leads to startup formations. This connection between academia and industry is invaluable.\n\nThe city\u2019s talent pool is diverse, covering various fields from technology to healthcare. Startups benefit immensely from this mix as they can tap into specialized knowledge and skills readily available within arm\u2019s reach.\n\nNetworking events frequently occur on campus or nearby, allowing young companies to connect with potential collaborators or investors who share their vision.\n\n\u2013 Supportive Government Initiatives\n\nBoston\u2019s government plays a pivotal role in nurturing its startup culture.

These programs often offer funding opportunities that are crucial for startups at various stages.\n\nMoreover, local agencies promote collaboration between startups and established firms.

This proactive approach creates an environment where creativity thrives alongside practicality, making it easier for innovative minds to flourish.\n\nSuccess Stories of Startups in Boston\n\nBoston has become a launchpad for numerous startups that have redefined industries. Companies like HubSpot, founded in 2006, transformed the marketing landscape with its innovative inbound marketing software. Its success showcases the potential of Boston\u2019s unique ecosystem.\n\nAnother notable example is Drift, a conversational marketing platform that emerged from the city\u2019s tech scene. Their approach to customer engagement is now an industry standard.\n\nThe life sciences sector also shines here. Moderna, known for its groundbreaking mRNA technology used in vaccines, has put Boston at the forefront of biotech innovation.\n\nThese stories reflect not just individual successes but a collective spirit driving entrepreneurship forward in Boston\u2019s vibrant startup culture. Each company adds to a narrative rich with creativity and resilience while inspiring future founders to pursue their dreams amidst challenges.\n\nChallenges Faced by the Startup Community in Boston\n\nThe startup community in Boston, while thriving, faces notable challenges. One significant hurdle is the high cost of living. Founders and employees often grapple with steep housing prices, making it difficult to attract and retain talent.\n\nDiversity remains another pressing issue. The lack of inclusivity can stifle innovation and limit perspectives within startups. Many entrepreneurs feel that a richer mix of backgrounds could lead to more groundbreaking ideas.\n\nBoston also competes fiercely with Silicon Valley for resources and attention. This rivalry creates pressure on local startups to perform at an exceptionally high level just to stay relevant.\n\nNavigating these challenges requires resilience from the entrepreneurial ecosystem. As founders adapt, they may find innovative solutions that not only benefit their companies but also enhance the overall landscape of Boston\u2019s startup culture.\n\n\u2013 High Cost of Living\n\nBoston\u2019s high cost of living presents a significant hurdle for startups and their teams. Housing prices have soared, making it challenging for entrepreneurs to attract talent without offering competitive salaries.\n\nThe expense doesn\u2019t stop at rent or mortgages. Basic necessities like groceries, transportation, and utilities also come with hefty price tags. This financial strain can pressure budding companies that are still in their early stages.\n\nMany young professionals find themselves juggling multiple jobs just to make ends meet while pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams. The reality is that the vibrant startup culture can sometimes feel inaccessible due to these economic barriers.\n\nAs founders seek innovative solutions, they must navigate this landscape wisely. It\u2019s a balancing act between fostering growth and managing expenses in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S.\n\n\u2013 Limited Diversity and Inclusivity\n\nDespite its vibrant ecosystem, Boston\u2019s startup culture faces challenges with diversity and inclusivity. The tech scene often mirrors the demographics of its surrounding areas, which can lead to a homogeneous environment.\n\nMany founders come from similar educational backgrounds and networks. This lack of varied perspectives can stifle creativity and innovation within startups.\n\nEfforts are being made to change this narrative, but progress is slow. Underrepresented groups still find it difficult to secure funding or mentorship opportunities in comparison to their counterparts.\n\nInitiatives aimed at fostering inclusivity exist, yet they need broader support from established businesses and investors. A shift towards embracing diverse talent could unlock new ideas and drive growth for all involved in the startup community.\n\n\u2013 Competition with Silicon Valley\n\nSilicon Valley often casts a long shadow over other startup ecosystems, and Boston is no exception. The tech giants of the West Coast have set high expectations for innovation and growth. This creates both inspiration and pressure for local startups.\n\nBoston\u2019s entrepreneurs frequently find themselves comparing their journeys to those in Silicon Valley. The allure of massive funding rounds and rapid scaling can be daunting. Yet, this competition drives Boston\u2019s startups to refine their ideas and focus on sustainable growth.\n\nWhile some may see it as a disadvantage, many embrace the challenge. It fosters creativity that differentiates Boston from its competitors. Startups here tend to emphasize quality over quantity, fostering deeper connections with customers.\n\nThis rivalry also encourages collaboration among local businesses looking to carve out their niche in the market. Instead of merely competing with Silicon Valley, Boston aims to complement it through unique innovations tailored for specific industries like healthcare and biotech.\n\nHow Boston\u2019s Startup Culture Impacts the City and its Economy\n\nBoston\u2019s startup culture significantly influences both the city and its economy. The influx of innovative companies fosters job creation, providing opportunities for residents across various skill levels.\n\nAs startups flourish, they attract talent from around the globe. This influx enriches the local workforce and stimulates diverse industries. A vibrant ecosystem emerges where established firms collaborate with newcomers, nurturing creativity and knowledge sharing.\n\nMoreover, successful startups often reinvest in their communities. They support local schools, nonprofits, and infrastructure projects through philanthropic efforts.\n\nThe economic ripple effect is undeniable; increased business activity enhances tax revenues that fund crucial public services and community development initiatives.\n\nThis dynamic also draws significant attention from investors looking to capitalize on Boston\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit, further fueling growth in technology sectors like biotech and software development.\n\nThe Future of Boston\u2019s Startup Scene\n\nBoston\u2019s startup scene is poised for exciting growth. The blend of innovation, education, and investment creates fertile ground for new ideas. As technology continues to evolve, so will the opportunities.\n\nEmerging sectors like biotech and artificial intelligence will play a pivotal role. Local firms are already at the forefront of these developments. Collaborations between startups and established companies can drive significant breakthroughs in various industries.\n\nThe city\u2019s commitment to sustainability also sets it apart. Many startups focus on green technologies, aiming to address climate challenges while fostering economic growth.\n\nMoreover, an increasing number of incubators and accelerators are emerging across Boston. These programs provide invaluable mentorship and resources for budding entrepreneurs.\n\nAs more diverse voices enter the ecosystem, fresh perspectives will shape innovative solutions. This evolution promises a vibrant future where creativity thrives alongside technological advancement.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe startup culture in Boston is thriving and unique, with a combination of factors that make it stand out from other cities. From its prestigious universities to its supportive infrastructure and collaborative community, Boston provides a promising environment for startups to grow and succeed. As more entrepreneurs flock to this innovative city, we can expect to see even more growth and success stories in the future. Whether you\u2019re an aspiring entrepreneur or simply curious about the startup scene, Boston\u2019s vibrant culture is definitely worth exploring."
