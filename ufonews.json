He said: \"I believe Trump views the subject in the same way as he views the JFK files, where, if there's top-secret information still being withheld, it should be declassified.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\"As he seems to link the two issues, there's a strong possibility of bombshell UFO information being released early in 2025, soon after his inauguration.\" During his first presidency, Trump released documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy - vowing to unveil the rest of them if re-elected.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhile appearing on a podcast in September, Trump said he would pressure Pentagon officials to declassify videos of alleged UFO sightings. Host Lex Fridman asked: \"Will you help push the Pentagon to release more footage, which a lot of people claim is available?\" Trump replied: \"Oh yeah, sure, I'll do that. I would do that.

Grusch eventually testified before congress, where he alleged the program involved the recovery of \"non-human spacecraft\" and their deceased pilots.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nLast month, Trump appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast shortly before Election Day, where the topic came up over the course of the three-hour schmooze.

Trump argued back: \"Well, maybe it's life that we don't know, but maybe it's a different kind of life.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nLast year, Republican senators called on Pentagon officials to take alleged sightings of UFOs seriously, which prompted an investigation by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). Earlier this year, the Pentagon published a 63-page report declaring no evidence of aliens or extraterrestrial technology on Earth."

        "article_content": "US Congress has promised to 'pull back the curtain' on secret UAP research programs conducted in the shadows of the government in a court of law.\n\nA second slew of hearings into UFOs is scheduled for November 13, led by the House Oversight Committee, with former military officials and an aerospace expert set to testify about their knowledge of secret US programs.\n\nLawmakers have promised 'to explore firsthand accounts of [UFOs]' and 'assess the federal government's transparency and accountability regarding their 'possible threats to national security.'\n\nRep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), a member of the subcommittee, said: 'The Pentagon and Washington bureaucrats have kept this information hidden for decades, and we're finally going to shed some light on it.\n\n'We're bringing in credible witnesses who can provide public testimony because the American people deserve the truth. We're done with the cover-ups.'\n\nThere will be four witnesses set to testify under oath, including former Department of Defense Official Luis Elizondo and former NASA Associate Administrator Michael Gold.\n\nCongress is set to hold a second hearing about UAPs that it promised will expose the truth to the American public, specifically about the research programs within the government. Pictured is the famous Tic Tac-shaped object seen in the sky over California on November 10, 2004\n\nNext week's hearing, set for 11:30am ET, will be a joint effort by Rep Nancy Mace (R-SC) and Rep Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.).\n\n'This is our second hearing on the topic of UAPs and the American people are tired of the obfuscation and refusal to release information by the federal government, they said in a shared statement.\n\n'Americans deserve to understand what the government has learned about UAP sightings and the nature of any potential threats these phenomena pose.\n\n'We can only ensure that understanding by providing consistent, systemic transparency. We look forward to hearing from expert witnesses on ways to shed more light and bring greater accountability to this issue.'\n\nThe committee has not released details on cases to be presented on Wednesday but provided the list of witnesses.\n\nElizondo, a career US Army counterintelligence specialist, previously ran the military's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.\n\nHe recently hosted a private event in Philadelphia on October 28 to reveal an image of an alleged UFO 'mothership.'\n\nThere will be four witnesses set to testify under oath, including former Department of Defense Official Luis Elizondo (pictured)\n\nElizondo recently hosted a private event in Philadelphia on October 28 to reveal an image of an alleged UFO 'mothership.'\n\n'There's a whole lot more here folks,' Elizondo told the audience in a leaked clip. 'I just want to give you kind of a small taste of what's going on 'behind the scenes.''\n\n'We're having pilots, military pilots and civilian pilots in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, report what unimaginably seems impossible,' as Elizondo explained his 'real photo' of a UFO.\n\n'They described it literally 'the mothership,' Elizondo said.\n\nInvestigative journalist Michael Shellenberger will also be sworn under oath.\n\nShellenberger \u2014 who is also an academic and a two-time candidate for California governor \u2014 went viral last month after publishing one of his anonymous whistleblower's accounts of an alleged UFO data collection program.\n\nThat classified UFO data retrieval effort, dubbed 'Immaculate Constellation,' was established in 2017 to 'detect' and 'quarantine' the military's best UFO imagery, along with its best videos, witness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nDr Tim Gallaudet, former rear admiral in the US Navy, launched a probe in March into unidentified submersible objects (USOs), specifically strange sightings on the seabed off the coast of California.\n\nInvestigative journalist Michael Shellenberger will also be sworn under oath. He went viral last month after publishing one of his anonymous whistleblower's accounts of an alleged UFO data collection program\n\nGold is a former NASA Associate Administrator who was part of the agency's UAP study in October 2022, which focused solely on unclassified data.\n\nOver nine months, the independent study team will lay the groundwork for future studies on the nature of UAPs for NASA and other organizations.\n\nThe hearing follows the bombshell case last year that was held by Burchett and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla).\n\nDavid Grusch - a former high-ranking intelligence official - was one of three military whistleblowers who testified under oath that they had firsthand encounters or knowledge about secret government programs involving technology that is 'non-human.'\n\nHe claimed that the US has been in possession of UFOs since 'the 1930s' and has been secretly back-engineering them and carrying out a public disinformation campaign to prevent the details from leaking publicly.\n\nRyan Graves, a former pilot, Air Force and intelligence agency veteran David Grusch and Navy veteran fighter pilot Commander David Fravor spoke at the first hearing in 2023\n\nDuring the hearing, Burchett asked Grusch: 'Personally, have you heard anyone [has] been murdered?'\n\nGrusch replied: 'I have to be careful answering that question. I directed people with that knowledge to the appropriate authorities.'\n\nHe was sworn in Wednesday, along with Ryan Graves, an esteemed former pilot, and Navy veteran fighter pilot Commander David Fravor, who witnessed the 2004 'Tic Tac' UFO.\n\nGraves, a former F-18 pilot with over a decade of service in the US Navy, was the first to give opening statements.\n\n'My testimony is based on information I've been given by individuals with a long-standing track record of legitimacy and service to this country, many of whom have shared compelling evidence in the form of photography, official documentation and classified oral testimony to myself and many various colleagues,' Graves told lawmakers, stating he was driven to share it by a 'commitment to truth and transparency.'\n\nBurchett described the 2023 hearing as 'historical.'\n\n'I'd like to thank these three brave witnesses here. They took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and, dagnammit, they're doing it,' he continued.\n\n'We're not bringing little green men or flying saucers into the hearing \u2014 sorry to disappoint about half of y'all \u2014 we're just going to get to the facts.\n\n'We're going to uncover the cover-up, and I hope this is just the beginning of many more hearings and many more people coming forward about this.'"

        "article_content": "Exclusive: Terrified man says 6ft aliens with 4 fingers kidnapped him - and expert says UFOs do exist\n\nIt is one of the world\u2019s most prolific UFO hotspots with around 300 annual sightings.\n\nBut it\u2019s not Area 51 or Roswell. This is Bonnybridge, a picturesque Scottish village at the apex of an area dubbed the Falkirk Triangle, where extraterrestrial encounters ranging from alien abductions to cigar-shaped spaceship sightings, are almost commonplace.\n\nKnown as the \u2018Roswell of Scotland\u2019 and compared to the Bermuda Triangle, because of speculation that it\u2019s a window to another dimension, intense UFO activity has sparked government investigation and pleas for help to four Prime Ministers.\n\n\u201cI have been doing this job for 45 years. I honestly believe that somewhere in the skies of this planet we are dealing with non-human intelligence,\u201d says UFO expert Malcolm Robinson, who says NASA, the American government and the Pentagon have all investigated extraterrestrial sightings.\n\nAs part of a new documentary series showing on Blaze, experts from around the world have tried to uncover why UFO activity in the Falkirk Triangle - located above the cities of Falkirk, Glasgow and Edinburgh - is so intense.\n\nA terrifying encounter in 1992 saw friends Garry Wood and Colin Wright claim they were taken prisoner by extraterrestrials in a flying saucer, as they drove towards Tarbrax, a south Lanarkshire village, to deliver a satellite TV system to a pal.\n\nIt was about 10pm when they spotted a \u201cblack\u201d object in the sky above them. It had no lights, was round at the bottom, had three parts and was 30ft wide.\n\nThe friends blacked out for they believe 10-15 seconds, coming to with their car facing in the opposite direction. Checking the time, they had lost an hour.\n\nSecret government \u201cX-files\u201d contain a two-page report on what became known as the \u201cA70 incident\u201d - sent to the Ministry of Defence\u2019s UFO desk in 1996, four years after the encounter.\n\nHeadlined \u201cUnexplained Aerial Sighting,\u201d it is based on evidence provided by Mr Wood, then a 33-year-old ambulance technician from Edinburgh.\n\nMalcolm Robinson says: \u201cDays after the incident, both men found scars on their bodies that weren\u2019t there before. Their wives refused to believe them, their colleagues at work refused to believe them.\u201d\n\nAfter looking up paranormal experiences in the local library, they found Malcolm, who suggested they had hypnosis - with astonishing results.\n\nSpeaking in 1996, Garry said: \u201cI saw three creatures coming towards my car. I felt intense pain, like an electric shock. Then I was in some room. I saw these things like wee men moving about, doing something to me. I could only see up. Then this 6ft creature approached.\n\n\u201cIt was white-grey in colour with a large head and dark eyes with a long, slender neck, very slim shoulders and waist. There were either ribs or folds of skin on its body. The arms were like ours, but there were four very long fingers.\u201d\n\nBy the 1990s, the MoD\u2019s UFO Unit was being inundated with reports of Falkirk Triangle sightings and public outcry intensified. Massive gatherings were held with UFO witnesses and concerned locals filling entire auditoriums, desperate for answers.\n\nLocal councillor Billy Buchanan and Malcolm Robinson lobbied parliament for an investigation, visiting Downing Street four times to meet with John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Rishi Sunak - but to no avail.\n\n\u201cWe are demanding that the British government open up an inquiry into UFO sightings in Scotland,\u201d says Malcolm. \u201cWe are happy to turn over our files and photographs. But I doubt anything will happen, they are too stuck in their ways.\n\n\u201cThey say that as these objects do not pose any threat to the security of the UK, the British Government will not open up any enquiries.\u201d\n\nAn earlier UFO sighting in 1979 saw forestry worker Bob Taylor, a WWII veteran who helped liberate Bergen Belsen, heading into woods at Dechmont Law to check for stray sheep and cattle.\n\nStepping into the clearing, Bob was confronted by a large circular sphere, which he later described as a \u2018flying dome\u2019 hovering above the forest floor.\n\nDark and metallic with a rough texture like sandpaper, it had small propellers on its outer rim. Smaller spheres resembling sea mines dropped down from beneath the hovering object, hit the ground and started rolling towards him, then dragging him towards the hovering craft.\n\nBob\u2019s last recalled a strange burning smell and a swishing sound before everything went black.\n\nUnable to drive when he came to, he walked back to his home in Livingston, breaking down and telling his wife he had been attacked.\n\nBob\u2019s pants were completely torn and he looked bedraggled and beaten. Authorities at the scene documented indentations on the ground.\n\nThe investigation concluded that Bob had experienced a particularly vicious attack - but by what?\n\nThe police eventually classed it as an assault by a person or persons unknown, shelving the report pending further evidence.\n\nOther experts wondered if Bob had been struck by lightning or suffered a seizure.\n\nDescribed throughout investigations as an honest, reliable man of good character, Bob remained faithful to his account until his death in 2007.\n\nHistorian Tony McMahon, who has been investigating the sightings, asks why eye-witnesses would leave themselves open to mockery, unless they truly believed they\u2019d had an alien encounter.\n\n\u201cThose involved were seen as reputable figures, not as flakes,\u201d he says. \u201cThese were completely normal people who had this absolutely bizarre experience.\n\n\u201cI think the fact that it has recurred in that area is fascinating.\n\n\u201cIn the case of the Falkirk Triangle we are dealing with people who are seen as pillars of the community and what happened to them was quite traumatic.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see an upside to making it up.\n\n\u201cI think these people genuinely believed that they saw what they reported.\u201d\n\nSome suggest the Falkirk Triangle is a UFO hotspot, as the thinning between worlds there is more fragile there than anywhere else in the UK, making it an ideal slipping point between dimensional realms.\n\nOthers believe that an intergalactic stream or highway runs through the area, making it an ideal celestial stopping point.\n\nArchaeologist Natasha Billson is quite sceptical, but notes that many UFO sightings are near places of archaeological importance.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to UFO sightings a lot of them are near to archaeological sites, such as Stonehenge,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the largest collection of stone circles in the British Isles are in Scotland.\u201d\n\nBut Tony McMahon says, like many other global UFO hotspots, the Triangle is within 50 miles of two military air bases and close to both Glasgow and Edinburgh Airports.\n\nHe explains: \u201cThere are two ways of looking at that. One is that what is happening on those military sites is misconstrued as UFO activity, everything from weather balloons to flares - even to cutting edge technology that the Government would rather you didn\u2019t know about. There is a perfectly good case to be made for that.\n\n\u201cEqually, there is an argument that if we are being watched by aliens, by extraterrestrials, there is every reason to suspect that they would take a particular interest in military installations.\n\n\u201cSome people say maybe they are taking an interest in military installations because they want to knock us out, invade, colonise us. But there is another argument put forward that they are taking an interest because they are protecting us from ourselves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s even an argument that alien technology has been shared with us, but the aliens won\u2019t share any more, because we keep misusing it against each other. \u201cSomebody wrote that after Hiroshima and Nagasaki the aliens decided that was more than enough.\u201d\n\nTop strangest sightings\n\nMalcolm Robinson is founder of Strange Phenomena Investigations Scotland - the country\u2019s oldest UFO society which turns 45 this month. Here are his top five Falkirk sightings.\n\n1. Dechmont Woods sighting\n\nBob Taylor\u2019s 1979 close encounter is the only case in the UK involving a full blown police investigation and forensic examination.\n\n2. The A70 alien abductions\n\nFriends Garry Wood and Colin Wright, were travelling from Edinburgh to Tarbrax in 1992 when they were stopped by a black object hovering above them in the sky and allegedly abducted by aliens.\n\n3. The Bonnybridge UFO sightings\n\nUfologists claim Bonnybridge is the world\u2019s number one UFO location, with an average of around 300 sightings a year.\n\n4. The Calvine Incident\n\nOn the 4 August 1990 at around 9pm, a diamond object estimated to be 100 feet wide and hovering for 10 minutes, before rising rapidly into the sky, was photographer near Calvine, Perth and Kinross, Scotland. Known as the Calvine UFO, it attracted world-wide attention when one of the photos was published 30 years later.\n\n5. The Sloggett family\n\nThe Sloggett family were walking towards Bonnybridge at around 7pm on a clear March evening in 1992 when they say they saw a circle of light land in a nearby field. They were later stopped by a football-sized blue light hovering above the road. Later, Isabella Sloggett said: \u201cMy daughter Carole and I saw a UFO land right in front of us. A door opened and there was a howl-like sound. I screamed and ran off terrified.\u201d"

        "article_content": "Amazon is considering investing billions of dollars in Anthropic, doubling down on a huge deal the companies struck this year, The Information reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne reason Amazon is so keen on Anthropic: The AI startup has been gaining on its rival OpenAI in recent months, according to data from a popular developer tool.\n\nThe AI SDK is a tool kit that helps developers build AI-powered applications. It provides code libraries that developers install to get their apps to communicate with different AI models. Data is published regularly showing how many times these code packages are downloaded each week.\n\nThis is a useful window into how popular the top AI models are with developers, a key constituency of early tech adopters.\n\nThe data shows that OpenAI remains in the lead but that Anthropic has been growing faster lately in terms of developer mindshare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the week of August 18, developers downloaded the OpenAI code library almost 229,000 times. The equivalent Anthropic library was downloaded almost 38,000 times.\n\nIn late October, OpenAI downloads were relatively unchanged, while Anthropic downloads were much higher: about 244,000 for OpenAI and 100,000 for Anthropic.\n\nData from NPM Trends. NPM Trends\n\nThe recent adoption trends can be partly explained by a new AI model Anthropic released in June.\n\n\"Anthropic's recent gains can be attributed to their Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, which, among many tasks, excels at understanding and generating code,\" said Jared Palmer, a vice president of AI at Vercel, a startup that offers the AI SDK and other developer tools. \"Its combination of speed, cost, and output quality has won over the developer community for the time being.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet has been particularly useful for tasks that developers need to do regularly, such as generating, checking, and fixing software code.\n\nStill, OpenAI has maintained its lead among developers because of its first-mover advantage and factors such as cheap pricing of its GPT-4o-mini AI model and strong developer tooling and documentation.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThere's also pretty widespread adoption of its API, or application programming interface. This is a common way for different software applications to communicate and share data.\n\nIt's worth noting, though, that OpenAI's lead is inflated by the download data. That's because many AI-model providers have adopted OpenAI's API specification as a de facto standard. That allows developers to use the same OpenAI code library package but point their apps to different models.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's hard to quantify how much this exaggerates OpenAI's lead, but the inflation of OpenAI's numbers here supports the general conclusion that Anthropic has been gaining on its main rival in recent months.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said usage of the startup's API had doubled since it released its GPT-4o mini AI model in July. The spokesperson added that OpenAI had also tripled the number of active apps running in production on its platform in the past year.\n\nThe OpenAI spokesperson criticized the data, saying downloads of these code libraries aren't an accurate representation of developer audience since they don't reflect actual usage or spending.\n\nAnthropic had no problem with the data. The company said its Claude 3.5 Sonnet model helped developers handle complex software architecture and multistep processes. It added that enterprises were increasingly adopting Claude for business-critical functions where accuracy is key, such as software development and data analysis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Our new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model is the ideal choice for developers to build AI-powered applications with state-of-the-art performance across the board, including coding, complex financial analysis, and live chat support,\" Dianne Penn, a product lead at Anthropic, told Business Insider.\n\nPenn cited DoorDash, Sourcegraph, and GitLab as companies using Claude to reduce development time, increase code acceptance rates, and build AI features."

        "article_content": "Visit Seoul and you quickly lose count of the number of Hyundai Caspers you see nipping in and out of the dense traffic.\n\nSharing its namesake with the friendly ghost, this diminutive city car has proven a smash hit on home turf thanks to its surprising practicality, clever use of interior space and parking space-friendly size.\n\nHyundai has decided to ditch the paranormal naming for the electric version of Casper that it plans to sell in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific, opting instead for a more Gen Z-friendly Inster moniker.\n\nThe resulting car, which I took for a spin recently, is only marginally larger than the petrol-powered Casper, measuring just 3,825mm long and 1,575mm tall. Perhaps more importantly, it's also just 1,600mm wide \u2013 an incredibly slim machine.\n\n(Image credit: Hyundai)\n\nThere are two battery options, 42kWh or a longer range 49kWh, which deliver power to a single motor. This is tuned to produce either 71.1kW (97hp) and 85.5kW (115hp) respectively.\n\nThe Inster\u2019s main party trick is the sheer amount of space it manages to cram inside its compact exterior proportions.\n\nIt\u2019s no pocket rocket, taking 10.6 seconds to hit 62mph from a standstill in the fastest versions.\n\nBut we are missing the point slightly here, because this is a vehicle with an even similar footprint than the recently driven Renault 5 E-Tech, the Fiat 500e and the hotly-anticipated Dacia Spring. It's also one that essentially transforms into a small commercial vehicle thanks to some clever folding seats and a great use of interior space.\n\nGet the best Black Friday deals direct to your inbox, plus news, reviews, and more.

Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIn South Korea, the cheeky little Casper not only transports families around town, it also doubles up as a shopping trolley, removals van and horticultural delivery truck whenever the need arises.\n\nIt has the can-do attitude that harks back to the days of the original Fiat Panda and even Renault\u2019s first-gen 4 and 5 \u2013 small, affordable cars that don\u2019t mind getting stuck in.\n\nAnd that's why it is worth paying attention to...\n\nAlmost on the money\n\n(Image credit: Hyundai)\n\nLet\u2019s address the elephant in the room before we get stuck into how excellent the little Inster is. In the UK, it will start at \u00a323,495 and rise to \u00a326,745 for the more lavishly appointed models.\n\nThere are no plans for it to go on sale in North America just yet (although there have been recent spy shots of it testing there), but those figures are around $30,400 / AU$46,000 and $35,000 / AU$52,600 respectively.\n\nIt\u2019s still an affordable car in the UK and Europe, but it isn\u2019t the ridiculously reasonable car that the South Koreans are treated to.\n\nThe price over there is around \u00a318,000 /$24,000 / AU$35,500 without any tax incentives and government rebates, dropping to just \u00a311,000 / $14,000 / AU$22,000 when you throw in some discounts.\n\n(Image credit: Hyundai)\n\nAt that sort of money, I\u2019d probably buy two, but the cost of shipping and import duties means the Inster is priced in a way that it competes with the more spacious and better built Renault 5 E-tech.\n\nEven the driver\u2019s seat folds down for a spot of Chabak \u2013 the South Korean craze for sleeping and camping in cars.\n\nIt is also a healthy chunk more expensive than the equally utilitarian Dacia Spring, which is difficult to spec up to more than \u00a316,000 (or around $21,000 / AU$31,500).\n\nIt\u2019s worth tackling the price first, simply because Inster needs to be viewed (and reviewed) as the vehicle that was designed for South Korea \u2013 an exceptionally affordable and eminently practical electric vehicle for the masses.\n\nSpace exploration\n\n(Image credit: Hyundai)\n\nThe Inster\u2019s main party trick is the sheer amount of space it manages to cram inside its compact exterior proportions. All four wheels are pushed to the extreme corners, freeing up every inch of space for people or cargo.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the boxy silhouette and high roof line means four adults can comfortably sit inside, without the need to stoop or have knees bashing on the seats in front. This is aided by four individual seats that slide and fold freely.\n\nWith all four seats in their normal positions, you\u2019d be lucky to fit any more than a couple of backpacks in the boot or trunk, but the rear seats can slide forward slightly (individually) to accommodate the space you need.\n\n(Image credit: Leon Poultney)\n\nPlus, the back seats fold completely flat and include clever \u2013 but very basic \u2013 covers on the rear that ensure the load space is completely flat and there are no gaps between the seats for objects to fall between.\n\nIf you need even more space, the front passenger seat folds flat, opening up enough room for a small surfboard.\n\nEven the driver\u2019s seat folds down for a spot of Chabak \u2013 or the South Korean craze for sleeping and camping in cars that are way too small for that stuff.\n\nIt\u2019s a magnificent example of excellent packaging and surprisingly comfortable to drive and cruise around in for extended periods of time.\n\nThe one major issue is the car\u2019s narrow footprint, which means drivers and passengers can butt shoulders up against the door pillars, particularly if you're of the Dwayne Johnson build.\n\nSpecs appeal\n\n(Image credit: Hyundai)\n\nHyundai has thrown every conceivable piece of tech at this car, which makes it even more alluring given its affordable price in its domestic market. There\u2019s a 10.25 digital instrument cluster and a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment display.\n\nIt\u2019s a magnificent example of excellent packaging and surprisingly comfortable to drive and cruise around in for extended periods of time.\n\nThat digital cluster can be personalized with a number of neat, graphical clock set-ups, while the infotainment system, borrowed from the wider Hyundai Motor Group, features all of the modern connected features customers demand.\n\nMapping, apps, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also part and parcel, although these are of the wired variety, despite there being a wireless charging pad.\n\n(Image credit: Hyundai)\n\nCustomers can option heated seats, a heated steering wheel and dazzling LED projection headlamps, while the Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) list is longer than most Tolstoy musings.\n\nParking collision avoidance, a surround view parking camera and the latest Highway Driving Assist 1.5, which automatically lane-keeps and adjusts speed to match local enforced limits, all come as standard on the car.\n\nThere\u2019s even 64-color LED ambient lighting inside (adjustable, of course) and vehicle-to-load (V2L) functionality that allows charging or operating of 110V/220V devices without bulky adaptors. Chabak devotees will be able to enjoy their cup of tea in the morning.\n\nMore than a city-slicker\n\n(Image credit: Hyundai)\n\nMaximum electric range in the smaller battery version is 327km (203 miles), extending to 370km (230 miles) in the longer range variant.\n\nThe Inster can charge at a max speed of 120kW, meaning it will take around 30 minutes to achieve an industry standard 10-80 per cent charge from faster public outlets.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly not the most impressive speed, but thanks to excellent efficiency and accurate range read-outs, it\u2019s not impossible to embark on lengthier road trips in the little trip machine.\n\nHyundai has also attempted to elevate the highway experience over the more basic Casper model with increased soundproofing throughout, upgraded shock absorbers and the use of a hydro bushing for the electric motor mount to decrease vibration and harshness.\n\nOverall refinement is pretty good for such a small car, but it\u2019s still not something I\u2019d want to spend hours on the highway in. The official max speed in the Long Range model is 93mph, but it feels like it\u2019s working hard at 70-75mph, Europe\u2019s typical speed limits.\n\n(Image credit: Hyundai)\n\nThis also begs the question, why ply Inster with every driver assistance system, including intelligent cruise control, when it\u2019s highly unlikely to spend a lot of time on the highway?\n\nBut without wanting to sound like a broken record here, the real issue is the price.\n\nPut simply, the Dacia Spring will offer much of the same (plus more room inside) for less money, while the similarly expensive Renault 5 E-tech is the more comfortable and premium-feeling car for most people.\n\nStill, it\u2019s difficult not to harbor a soft spot for Inster. It\u2019s too cute and a little bit silly, yet practical and very serious in its tech offering.\n\nPlus, it transforms into a double bed, should that be on your list of EV \u2018must-haves\u2019."

        "article_content": "As a documentary series living up to its title in every way conceivable, Netflix\u2019s \u2018Investigation Aliens\u2019 can only be described as equal parts baffling, intriguing, as well as mind-blowing. That\u2019s because it follows legendary reporter George Knapp as he travels the globe to investigate reports of various unidentified anomalous phenomena in the hopes of figuring out the why behind it all. Therefore, of course, this original production gives us a clear insight into not just his professional skill sets but also how he has managed to hone them over the years to be the best.\n\nGeorge Knapp Worked Hard to Earn the Title of Journalist\n\nAlthough born in Woodbury, New Jersey, on April 18, 1952, George actually grew up around Stockton, California, in a relatively comfortable, happy, loving, and stable household. It was here that he also developed an interest in journalism at a young age, resulting in him pursuing a Bachelor\u2019s in Communications from the University of West Georgia upon graduating high school. As if that\u2019s not enough, he then earned a Master\u2019s in the same field, too, ultimately completing his studies at the University of the Pacific in the mid-1970s to kickstart his career.\n\nThe truth is George spent the initial few years of his professional life at his alma mater, teaching both debate and forensics, before soon finding himself at the University of California-Berkeley. However, when the opportunity arose for him to relocate to Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1979, he grabbed it with both hands, even if it meant making ends meet by serving as a cab driver for a few months. Thankfully, everything soon turned around for him as he managed to land an internship at KLVX-TV Channel 10, from where he quickly rose the ranks to evolve into a reporter at KLAS-TV in 1981.\n\nGeorge Knapp Never Went Looking for UFO Stories, They Found Him\n\nWhile George has held a myriad of positions at KLAS over the past 4+ decades he has served there, most of his work has actually revolved around the paranormal world, particularly UFOs. Nevertheless, this wasn\u2019t always the case \u2014 in fact, at first, he primarily reported on topics such as government corruption, international affairs, organized crime, and other daily matters. It was actually only in the late 1980s that he found his calling as an extraterrestrial reporting specialist after aviator and UFO claimant John Lear walked into the building with a file full of documents.\n\nAccording to George\u2019s accounts, John went to his boss and vehemently asserted he had the story of a lifetime for him \u2014 about the government\u2019s cover-up of UFOs \u2014 yet the latter refused. Therefore, as John was walking away, the ambitious reporter stopped him in his tracks, asked to look at the information, as well as confirmed if he would be willing to go on air with his claims. Little did he know his subsequent interview with the pilot on his self-produced KLAS show \u2018On the Record\u2019 would blow up to such an extent he started getting calls and mails from other alleged witnesses worldwide, driving him to seriously look deeper into the matter.\n\nAfter all, George realized there had to be something in all these strange assertions owing to some eerie similarities they all shared, even if they allegedly happened years and worlds apart. What has always made him stand out from his colleagues as well as ufologists is that he unwaveringly, unbiasedly investigates debunking conspiracies and claims of hoaxes, too. Thus, it comes as no surprise he is not only an award-winning journalist but has also earned the honor of often being referred to as \u201cone of the most prominent news anchors in the Las Vegas area.\u201d\n\nGeorge Knapp is a Man of Many Hats\n\nWhile George has unfortunately even faced more than his fair share of ridicule regarding his beliefs and specialty over the years, it hasn\u2019t deterred him from any of his complex investigations. In fact, as an anchor, chief investigative reporter, and commentator at the CBS affiliate KLAS-TV, he continues to look into every claim that comes to light in the hopes of finally finding some answers. Whether it be the secretive Area 51, international assertions of UFO plus USO sightings, alleged extraterrestrial contact, or the possibility of these supposed aliens being time-traveling humans from the future, he is exploring every avenue even today.\n\nGeorge genuinely believes that bringing proof of alien existence, if truly out there, is essential for our society as it would help us better understand the world and its many possible dangers. This is partly why he returned to the field of journalism/KLAS in 2005 after walking away from it all in 1991 to serve at a public relations firm by the name of Altamira Communications. And now, he is also a proud author, co-host of the \u2018Weaponized\u2019 podcast alongside paranormal/unexplained investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell, host of a radio show called \u2018Coast to Coast\u2019 AM, as well as a weekly columnist for a local Las Vegas newspaper.\n\nAs for George\u2019s personal standing, from what we can tell, this former employee of the now-defunct National Institute of Discovery Science (NIDS) is a happily married man. He actually prefers to keep his private life well away from the limelight owing to safety concerns, yet we do know he tied the knot with the love of his life, longtime girlfriend Anne \u201cThe Viking\u201d Fechner, on August 5, 2010. They promised one another forever in a cozy, intimate ceremony in Kauai, Hawaii, following which they returned to settle down in Las Vegas for good, which is where they still happily remain.\n\nIt\u2019s also imperative to note that George, whose most recent book titled \u2018Skinwalkers at the Pentagon\u2019 with co-authors Colm Kelleher and James Lacatski was published in 2023, is a cat dad, a massive sports enthusiast, and an unwavering music fan too. In fact, whenever he is not working or spending quality time with loved ones, it appears as if he likes the experience of live shows \u2013 Blink 182, Angels & Airwaves, and John Fogerty, he has seen them all live in the past few years alone.\n\nRead More: Kevin Randle: Where is the Ufologist Now?"

The object, designated 2024 UQ, was discovered just two hours before entering Earth's atmosphere, and fortunately, there was no real threat, since it measured only 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter.\n\nThe Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, a four-telescope survey based in Hawaii for monitoring near-Earth objects, had discovered the asteroid on October 22. Within days of its detection, 2024 UQ disintegrated in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean, off California, creating an \"imminent impactor,\" or an impact where Earth-bound objects are detected hours before hitting the planet.\n\nAlso Read | London's Iconic Dogstar Nightclub Forced To Close Down Before Squatters Take Over\n\n\"ATLAS survey obtained images that included detections of a small object in a high-probability collision course. However, due to the location of the object near the edge of two adjacent fields, the candidate was recognized as a moving object only a few hours later,\" ESA wrote in the newsletter.\"By the time the astrometry reached the impact monitoring systems, the impact had already happened.\"\n\nThat close call serves to highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of the modern track system and sets an argument for continuing investment in early detection technology. While harmless in this circumstance, the situation serves to bring focus to Earth's continued improvement efforts in regards to space surveillance-the possibility of potentially dangerous space rocks slipping undetected."

Still with us?\n\nThanks to this, the hybrid model accounted for the JWST's observations and also put the universe's age to 26.7 billion years.\n\nAdvert\n\nAlthough the Hubble Space Telescope had already guessed at the 'impossible early galaxy' issue, the JWST's launch in December 2021 strengthened these claims.\n\nNow, scientists have a clear picture of when the universe came to be, and this could help them in the future to recalculate the date of emerging planets, among other things.\n\nAs the universe continues to be a vast space of confusion for us to wrap our heads around, at least this one thing has been put to bed at last."

        "article_content": "\u2018High water mark\u201d: Stone Gossard on the best project he ever worked on\n\nIt\u2019s hard for any artist to decide what their best work is. Records can be like musical children for anyone, but even if some resonate with the public better, they will still have affection for the strange records that never got the spotlight they deserved. Although Pearl Jam has boasted some of the strangest detours that any major band has gone down, Stone Gossard claimed that this emotional album set the bar for what he could do with his bandmates.\n\nThen again, it\u2019s hard to call anything that Pearl Jam did as formulaic. Although they have had their stadium rock moments across the first half of their career, Eddie Vedder seemed to make it a point to switch it up every time they make a record, whether that\u2019s going back to art-rock styles on No Code or making the alternative equivalent of a new wave record on Backspacer in the late 2000s.\n\nIf time had worked out a little differently, though, Vedder probably wouldn\u2019t have been a part of Pearl Jam at all. Gossard and co. had been working fine in Mother Love Bone with frontman extraordinaire Andy Wood, but the minute that he died of a drug overdose, there was no way that anyone could continue on with the group.\n\nThat would have been the equivalent of Queen trying to make music without Freddie Mercury, but even though they were lost, Chris Cornell helped them find the way out with Temple of the Dog. The grunge screamer had no plans to leave Soundgarden, but with the help of Matt Cameron, Temple of the Dog became one of the most moving tribute albums anyone has made, especially with them turning their tunes into a rock and roll wake on \u2018Say Hello 2 Heaven\u2019.\n\nAnd even if they weren\u2019t thinking about it then, this was the perfect breeding ground for Pearl Jam. Mike McCready had been brought in to play a couple of leads, but his stellar performance on \u2018Reach Down\u2019 as well as Vedder\u2019s vocal cameo on \u2018Hunger Strike\u2019 was practically the first incarnation of Pearl Jam with Cornell on vocals instead of Vedder.\n\nEven though decades had passed since Temple of the Dog, Gossard still considered it one of the best records he had been involved with, saying, \u201cWe made a record with Chris Cornell called Temple of the Dog. I still listen to it and think that it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever been involved with. Whatever that combination of people was, I\u2019d never been in a situation where it was that easy. I\u2019ve almost been looking for that ever since.\u201d\n\nBut maybe the raw pain behind the record made it so easy. No one in this band wanted to do anything other than do Wood proud, and by leaving everyone\u2019s ego at the door, tunes like \u2018Pushing Forward Back\u2019 and \u2018All Night Thing\u2019 probably served as healing much better than any kind of therapy would have.\n\nWhereas most records can be thrown together to sell millions of copies, Temple of the Dog earned its reputation because it was written for no one else but the group members. The public may have seen a supergroup in the making years later, but nothing mattered more to them than sending off their friend properly."

In it, they said Trump would be \u201cselecting personnel to serve our nation under his leadership and enact policies that make the life of Americans affordable, safe, and secure\u201d in the coming weeks from \u201ca wide array of experts\u201d they\u2019ve assembled for his review.\n\nOne day later, Trump\u2019s transition team issued another press release announcing that the president-elect had made his first major staffing decision of his second term \u2014 the selection of longtime Republican operative and de facto 2024 campaign manager Susie Wiles to be his White House chief of staff.\n\nWiles will be the first woman to serve in the White House\u2019s top staff role, one that was largely thankless during Trump\u2019s first term. Over his four years in the White House from 2017 to 2021, Trump cycled through four chiefs of staff, with all but one exiting after trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to bring a semblance of order to the freewheeling style preferred by the ex-real estate mogul turned television star turned politician.\n\nHe is famous for encouraging, even relishing, internal conflicts and internecine warfare among his closest aides. It\u2019s said that he is as entertained by the infighting as viewers of The Apprentice were before he ended episodes by firing whoever lost the internal competition.\n\nBut Wiles, the daughter of legendary NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall and a renowned GOP power player in her own right, isn\u2019t one to embrace the drama. The campaign she ran along with veteran strategist Chris LaCivita was relatively drama-free and leak-averse compared with Trump\u2019s first two presidential efforts.\n\nOne Trumpworld veteran who spoke to The Independent on condition of anonymity said the pick is an indicator of the president-elect\u2019s respect for and trust in Wiles, who took over his political operation when he was in the veritable wilderness, reeling from the backlash to January 6th. The source described Wiles as a rare person who has the ability to say \u201cno\u201d to Donald Trump.\n\nThe Independent understands that Trump\u2019s selection of Wiles early on was meant to take some of the pressure off him from supporters and office-seekers who\u2019ve come calling in the days since his victory in hopes of bending his ear or securing roles in his new administration.\n\nIn theory, this means Wiles \u2014 not the president-elect \u2014 can be the point person for naming key staff roles and helping to roll out new appointment announcements.\n\nBut the transition team Trump has at his disposal isn\u2019t looking much like the one that ushered him into the White House in 2017. That was a chaotic effort compounded by his decision to replace voluminous plans assembled by then-New Jersey governor Chris Christie with a slapdash plan nominally headed up by Mike Pence. In actuality, it became a two-headed hydra of an operation with rival power bases in Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and then-incoming White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nIvanka Trump\u2019s husband Jared Kushner took a central role in the first Trump administration (REUTERS)\n\nBack then, Trump\u2019s transition team followed precedent and procedure by working with the General Services Administration, the government agency that by law provides incoming administrations with official office space and other resources, including what is needed for incoming administration officials to obtain security clearances and liaise with the myriad federal agencies they will have to staff and supervise at noon on January 20, 2025.\n\nBut this time, it appears the Trump team could eschew much of the official support in favor of a privatized model without precedent in modern history.\n\nThe initial statement released by transition chairs Lutnick and McMahon referenced \u201cthe next steps of Trump Vance 2025 Transition, Inc., a 501(c)(4) organization,\u201d indicating that the new-look Trump team wants to keep the federal government \u2014 including the civil servants that are tasked with assisting the transition \u2014 away from the people who will soon lead the federal government.\n\nTo start, a 501(c)(4) organization, named for the section of the Internal Revenue Code that authorizes such \u201csocial welfare\u201d organizations, aren\u2019t required to publicly disclose their donors. And by keeping the transition off of any official government email systems, the Trump team can evade having their emails requested by any Democratic or nonpartisan transparency groups under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAs of now, the Trump transition hasn\u2019t signed the memoranda of understanding that officially starts the transition process by letting the incoming team interface with the GSA and gain access to \u201coffice space, IT equipment, office supplies, fleet vehicles, mail management, and payment of compensation and other expenses\u201d available after an election is conceded.\n\nAlthough the agency notified the Trump team that it\u2019s eligible for government support on Wednesday, hours after Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the race to the president-elect, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday that there\u2019s been no official acceptance of the offer. But she did say that Biden\u2019s chief of staff, Jeff Zients, has \u201creached out\u201d to the Trump team. She stressed that they would \u201cleave that line of communications open\u201d in hopes of facilitating \u201can effective, efficient transition of power.\u201d\n\nYet Trump allies are indicating that the transition may not be so smooth.\n\nReporting from The New York Times and other outlets has also indicated that Trump and his team are strongly considering skipping the process by which administration officials normally obtain security clearances after FBI background checks.\n\nInstead, Trump aides have reportedly argued for the president-elect to unilaterally grant clearances to top aides based on private background investigations done by a firm contracted by the transition.\n\nAlready, Trump-aligned groups such as Stephen Miller\u2019s America First Legal are publicly railing against the FBI and accusing it of illegally leaking information on presidential nominees to congressional staff. The group said in a press release that the Department of Justice-led process \u201chas been and will be weaponized against nominees in any future administration, including the Trump Administration.\u201d\n\nBecause security clearances are an executive function, the president can grant anyone a clearance at any level for any reason, even over the objections of the national security professionals who assess whether a given individual can be trusted with the nation\u2019s secrets. And as an elected official, Trump himself is exempt from clearance requirements despite his long and documented history of mishandling and allegedly unlawfully retaining national defense information.\n\nHe exercised this unilateral authority during his first term when he ordered his second chief of staff, John Kelly, to grant Kushner, then a White House senior adviser, a permanent \u201ctop secret\u201d security clearance after a months-long period during which the real estate scion was only allowed a much lower level \u201csecret\u201d one. Though Kushner had been allocated the \u201ctop secret\u201d credential on an interim basis early on in the first Trump administration, that temporary clearance was pulled and replaced with much lower \u201csecret\u201d clearance after national security officials and then-White House counsel Don McGahn raised concerns flagged by the US intelligence community about the president\u2019s son-in-law.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Kelly was so disturbed by the move that he authored a contemporaneous memorandum in which he wrote that he\u2019d been directly ordered to grant Kushner the clearance over the objections from both McGahn and the CIA.\n\nA former White House security adviser, Tricia Newbold, was similarly troubled by decisions around clearances in the early days of Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 so much so that she went to Congress with her concerns seeking whistleblower status. She told Democrats on the House Oversight Committee that numerous Trump appointees were denied clearances because of foreign influence concerns, conflicts of interest, financial issues, questionable conduct and even illicit drug use.\n\nIt\u2019s not fully clear what criteria the new Trump administration might use to grant access to sensitive information this time around if not those used by the FBI.\n\nUsually, appointees are screened for foreign ties, potential conflicts of interest, and susceptibility to blackmail. But given Trump\u2019s well-documented obsession with loyalty, it\u2019s very possible that fealty to the new administration \u2014 not the United States itself \u2014 could become an important metric.\n\nTo that end, Trump administration hopefuls are already flocking to his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida, where he and his team are making their plans, in hopes of kissing the ring and securing the new president\u2019s favor."

        "article_content": "Your retail store design should leverage every resource you have, from image marketing to emphasizing the quality of your products, to bring about a sale. If you look at the top trends in retail store design, they predominantly revolve around making a sale. They focus on creating an undeniable customer experience that supports every customer walking to the front with products in tow to buy something.\n\nAfter you have traffic in-store, your job is not done until they have made a purchase. Based on present trends, here is how you can apply a sales-oriented mindset to your retail store design.\n\nMinimalist Design\n\nMinimalism uses clean lines and neutral colours to facilitate uncluttered, simple spaces. It keeps the focus on the products. Minimalism is a major trend in retail store design, offering a sophisticated feel with no sensory overload.\n\nBiophilic Design\n\n\u2018Biophilic\u2019 refers to plants, natural light, and organic materials. It brings the outside in. Biophilic elements have been shown to enhance customer satisfaction and encourage longer visits.\n\nIntegrate Digital\n\nMore retail store designs are embracing integrating digital with the in-store experience. This features click-and-collect areas, QR codes, and mobile app compatibility. This omnichannel experience is becoming the norm for more retail brands.\n\nSmart Technology in Retail\n\nRetail is upgrading to smarter tech and AI-driven software. Interactive digital signage software is perhaps the most diverse tech in retail. There are also digital price tags, AI-powered customer service, real-time data monitoring, and streamlined checkouts.\n\nTap Into Retail Software\n\nAdvanced retail software can display information about customers you may not otherwise know. Retail software is also trained to identify recommended add-on purchases, cross-selling and upselling opportunities, and more. Use this data to shift your retail store layout.\n\nWindow Displays\n\nWindow displays are your walk-by or drive-by advertisement to passersby. They\u2019re an opportunity to display your best-sellers and the merchandise that best represents your brand.\n\nInteraction with Products\n\nFocus on ways your retail store design can facilitate interactions with a product. This may include a free sample, a free tryout, a how-to demonstration, or creating a merchandise display where there\u2019s interaction.\n\nAny items you have on sale or that are your best-sellers should be placed at the center of the store. Do not make these products hard to find. When they are at the center of the store, no customer will have to ask where to find them.\n\nHighlight Your Loyalty Program\n\nLoyalty programs appreciate the customer and elevate sales. Make yours packed with benefits and perks. Emphasize your loyalty program on signage in-store, ensuring that customers opt-in.\n\nHost an Experience\n\nDesign, d\u00e9cor, layout, and planning can make any retail store experiential. An experience can make your store stand out. Use the right d\u00e9cor. Host an event. Make your retail store an experience that customers will remember.\n\nEco-Friendly Sustainability\n\nYour store design should highlight some element of sustainability, be it the use of sustainable materials in product packaging or energy-efficient lighting and eco-friendly products on the line. Many shoppers want to know about sustainability efforts and want you to demonstrate a welcoming, eco-friendly store.\n\nCreative Displays\n\nUnique merchandise displays highlight what products you have in stock and what products are worth buying. They can emphasize new products and best-sellers and elevate your in-store visual merchandise game.\n\nModular Layouts\n\nMore companies are opting for flexible layouts, especially for smaller retail stores. They enjoy being able to reconfigure a store based on the season. Modular displays and movable shelving mean the shopping experience can be fresh year-round.\n\nOpen, Airy Layouts\n\nMinimal inventory on the floor and an open, uncluttered layout can allow customers to move freely. It reduces congestion, making shoppers feel more comfortable and less stressed in-store.\n\nPoint-of-Purchase Displays\n\nPoint-of-purchase displays near the register allow customers to buy complementary products and add-ons. For last-minute impulse purchases, go here. Here, you can inch every sale up by a few dollars.\n\nEmbracing Industrial Elements\n\nA store fortunate enough to have exposed brick, metal beams, and raw concrete in its building shouldn\u2019t ignore these industrial-chic elements. They appeal to many shoppers and offer a rugged style that conveys authenticity.\n\nMaximize Natural Light\n\nLarge windows and skylights should increase natural light and reduce the need for cold, artificial light. Natural light gives your store a more eco-conscious image while creating an inviting atmosphere that is hard to achieve with artificial light.\n\nSpecial In-Store Deals\n\nUse digital signage software to highlight special deals, such as a buy-one-get-one offer or 50% off select items. Openly advertise your best in-store deals to increase the likelihood of a customer buying more.\n\nLocal Art and Culture\n\nFeature local artwork in-store to foster a sense of authentic community. Localized design elements connect your brand to its surroundings and can give a retail store a unique feel."
