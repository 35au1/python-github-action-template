            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is Part 2 of a two-part series about UFOs/UAPs and the connection between past sightings in the Minot area and the recent sightings of mysterious drones across the country.\n\nDrones have been swarming military facilities and around U.S. ships for a year or two and in all cases they were never shot down, Steve Bassett, a UFO lobbyist and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, told The Minot Daily News in a Dec. 26, 2024, interview.\n\nBecause of all the recent sightings of mysterious drones in the U.S. and also in the United Kingdom, Bassett said, \u201cPeople are filming them with their cameras and these films are turning up online. The government is getting hard questions and the best that the U.S. government has been able to do in several interviews with the press is that it\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s not a foreign adversary or another nation and we don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\u201cNow this is ridiculous,\u201d Bassett said. He said any swarms of objects like that around U.S. warships would be shot down and every effort would be made to bring them down if any of these objects were over military bases.\n\n\u201cBut it would be a huge, huge national security matter. We know that they\u2019re not shooting them down; they\u2019re not capturing them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said people are seeing what obviously are drones.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of other stuff up there which are not drones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only conclusion that makes sense is that this is a UFO (unidentified flying object) flap. There have been a number of these (flaps) over the last 70 years. There\u2019s a lot of sightings, a lot of stuff in the area even nationally and then it goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest one ever. It\u2019s been going on for at least two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI believe what is going on is that the nonhumans \u2013 or whatever you want to call them. I call them extraterrestrials \u2013 are putting on a helluva display. They are swarming around sensitive facilities and the reason they are doing that is not to attack those facilities but to get the maximum attention. They are doing this for a reason and the government is helpless. There\u2019s nothing it can do about it.\u201d\n\nBassett maintains the government knows that they\u2019re nonhuman.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely know that these are not human craft, human-made craft, whatever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what do you do? They can\u2019t ignore it. They have to answer the questions and the best they\u2019ve been able to do is they\u2019re not ours, they\u2019re not another counties, they\u2019re not a threat and they\u2019re not shooting them down,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he believes the military is launching its own drones up into these events so people do see drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re masking the nonhuman part of this by at least adding the human part so people will see that and then they can just call it a drone swarm and not have to face the ultimate question is what are those things up there that aren\u2019t drones?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing that explains what is happening within the standard logic that one can imply and the government is in an impossible position and if the nonhuman craft up there continue and continue to do this activity, the government is going to have to finally acknowledge that we are not alone. That\u2019s what I think is going on,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nNuclear weapons shutdown witnesses\n\nHe went on, \u201cNow the reason I think this is interesting for Minot is that, of course, this has made it much easier to get the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses and other related witnesses to the attention of Congress.\u201d\n\nBassett said it\u2019s very likely the next hearing will include the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses. He said the witnesses to nuclear ICBM shutdown events have been trying to get in front of a hearing in Congress for many years but have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to bring those cases really back into the world and people will learn about what happened 60 years ago,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nHe said some of the witnesses have been reluctant to speak about the incidents because it wasn\u2019t a good situation.\n\n\u201cBut the situation is obviously changing so I think that we may see several more be willing to come forward once we have the formal hearing process,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he has said in hundreds of interviews that the shutdown of ICBMs by these entities is the single most important thing known about them.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that mock hearing in 2013 would help lead to real hearings\u201d He said it provided some help but it took several more years before a hearing finally took place.\n\nWhen another congressional hearing is held, David Schindele, a former Minot Air Force Base missile officer who was involved in a UFO incident that occurred in the Minot missile field in 1966, said he would \u201cdefinitely testify before Congress when I\u2019m called to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Trump, there\u2019s a very good possibility that he\u2019s going to seize this, based upon what I\u2019ve been reading in the news and other statements. He may jump on this early. We could see this break in the first 30 to 60 days of the Trump administration. We could have hearings that may come forward or he may just come forward on his own because he\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Bassett said.\n\n\u201cSo this embargo on the truth of this matter may be about to end in the next couple months and it can\u2019t happen too soon,\u201d Bassett said."

            "article_content": "A UFO expert has lifted the lid on some of his wildest encounters as we reveal the top five hotspots in the UK.\n\nNick Pope, who previously ran the British Government\u2019s UFO Project, spoke about his experiences with extraterrestrial life in an exclusive chat with The Sun.\n\n4 Nick Pope is former head of the MoD's UFO research programme Credit: Chris Loomis / National Geographic\n\n4 Nick lifted the lid on some extraterrestrial mysteries\n\n4\n\nFor over two decades, Nick worked as a civilian employee at the MoD, with his most prominent role beginning in the early 1990s, where he ran the department's UFO program.\n\nNick was at the helm of the project, an initiative that monitored and investigated reports of unidentified flying objects to assess their potential impact on national security and aviation safety.\n\nAlthough the program was never formally named, it was often referred to as the \u201cUFO desk\u201d or \u201cUFO program\u201d by a number of media outlets.\n\nWhen looking at the distribution of these sightings across the UK, Nick and his team discovered that the hotspots were not necessarily the rural or remote locations that many assumed.\n\nNick told The Sun: \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because when we mapped out the UFO sightings, they didn\u2019t necessarily occur in remote, rural areas.\n\n\u201cThe hotspots were often London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow \u2013 all the major cities and urban areas.\n\n\"The reason for this is simple - the more people there are in an area, the more likely someone is to spot something unusual in the sky.\u201d\n\nThese cities, with their dense populations, provided more potential witnesses.\n\nIt meant that if something strange appeared in the sky, the chances of someone witnessing it were far higher.\n\nNick also notes that other areas, like Warminster have been known for their frequent UFO sightings.\n\n\u201cPeople used to go up Cradle Hill and Flea Hill in Warminster, and even some 1960s pop songs referenced the place,\u201d he added.\n\nBonnybridge, in Scotland, saw a huge surge in UFO sightings in the 1990s, to the extent that local councillor Billy Buchanan lobbied the government for an inquiry.\n\n\u201cI ended up drafting the replies to Buchanan\u2019s letters, which were sent to the Ministry of Defence,\u201d Nick recalls.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t very happy with me because the government line was always to play down the significance of UFO sightings.\u201d\n\nDespite the official stance, Nick acknowledges that Bonnybridge was, indeed, a hotspot.\n\nPilots told they\u2019re \u2018cleared to manoeuvre to avoid the UFO\u2019 in eerie audio as \u2018strange\u2019 lights spark fears in Oregon\n\nHowever, Nick also cautions against confirmation bias, adding: \u201cWhen people go to these hotspots for sky watches, they may already be believers, which can affect how they perceive what they see.\n\n\"They may be more likely to misperceive something or to see what they expect to see.\u201d\n\nAnother factor is the issue of light pollution in cities, which can obscure the view of the sky.\n\nDespite this, urban areas remained UFO hotspots due to the sheer number of potential witnesses.\n\nEven more intriguing, Nick pointed out, was the fact that UFO sightings seemed to cluster around military bases, particularly air force bases.\n\nWhile some argue that these sightings are due to secret military aircraft or advanced aerospace technology, the fact remains that military bases are more heavily surveilled, and the likelihood of sightings there is higher.\n\nFrom Rendlesham Forest to Cosford, Nick has worked on some of the most high-profile cases in UFO history, all while trying to navigate the Ministry\u2019s official stance on the phenomenon.\n\nAnd according to Nick, the number of UFO sightings reported in the UK was far higher than most people realise with reports representing only the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\"We\u2019d get about 200 to 300 reports a year, and at its peak, that number went up to 700 or 800,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cBut even that number is misleading because many sightings went unreported due to fear of ridicule or simply not knowing who to contact.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Nick believes the actual number of UFO sightings in the UK each year could be in the tens of thousands.\n\nThe MoD had a national reporting system for UFO sightings, with people reaching out to local police stations, military bases, and airports.\n\nHowever, sightings reported to the media or civilian UFO research groups were not always included in the official data.\n\nWhat to do if you spot a UFO? \u201cIf you see something, say something,\u201d Nick advises anyone who observes a UFO. He recommends capturing the best possible image or video, though with caution regarding the zoom feature on smartphones, which can distort images. If the sighting occurs in the daytime, it\u2019s vital to include some ground features in the shot. He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re just looking at something against the blank sky, you have no idea how far away it is, how high it is, or how big it is. \"But if you capture hills, trees, rooftops, something like that, we can triangulate. We can make those calculations.\u201d\n\nThe Calvine Incident\n\nAmong the most compelling pieces of evidence Nick Pope encountered during his time at the MoD was the Calvine Incident.\n\nNick said: \"I think, the best photographic evidence we had came from a case called the Calvine Incident in August of 1990.\n\n\"This was just before my posting on the UFO desk, so my predecessor would have handled the investigation, but I certainly got involved in it.\"\n\nThe case involved two hikers in Scotland who captured six crystal-clear photographs of a large, diamond-shaped craft.\n\nNick, who inherited the investigation, recalls: \u201cThese photographs were examined by the UK\u2019s top imagery analysts\u2014Defence Intelligence Staff, Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre.\n\n\u201cWe concluded that this was the real deal. This wasn\u2019t a hoax.\u201d\n\nThe photos showed an object about 70 to 90 feet in diameter, with no visible means of propulsion, a detail that intrigued Nick and his colleagues.\n\nThe absence of conventional aerodynamic features, like wings or rotor blades, made the object even more mysterious.\n\nThe incident also featured a military jet circling the UFO, possibly trying to intercept it or gather data.\n\n\u201cThis was a genuine mystery on our hands,\u201d he adds, noting that the object in the photographs moved in ways that defied conventional aircraft design.\n\nNick also highlights the potential connection between the timing of the sighting and the geopolitical events unfolding in August 1990.\n\nReflecting on the mystery, he said: \"The photographs were taken just two days after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, a moment that sparked preparations for military action.\n\n\u201cWe wondered if this could have been a military prototype or reconnaissance aircraft.\n\n\u201cWe asked both our own people and the Americans about this, but the Americans denied it.\"\n\nDespite the U.S. government\u2019s denials, Nick and his team remained unconvinced. \u201cSometimes we thought, \u2018This is not just next generation; this is something a generation ahead.\u2019 And if that\u2019s the case, where is it now?\u201d\n\nNick asks. \"Where is the Rendlesham UFO? Where is the Cosford UFO now? Ten years later, these should have been unveiled. We should be seeing them at the Farnborough Air Show, but we\u2019re not.\"\n\nThe question of whether UFO sightings could be attributed to advanced human technology is one that constantly resurfaced in Nick\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cAt any given time, there will be tech that\u2019s 5, 10, even 15 years ahead of what the public knows,\u201d Nick explains.\n\nHe points to historical examples, such as the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird, which were years ahead of their time when they were first introduced.\n\nCosford Mystery\n\nA key event from Nick\u2019s time at the MoD was the Cosford UFO sighting in March 1993.\n\nHe said: \"It took place over a series of 6 hours or thereabouts on March 30, the and March 31, 1993. So that was right in the middle of my posting.\n\n\"So of course, I led the investigation into this and my case file, which is over a hundred pages of documents.\"\n\nOver many hours, several witnesses, including police officers and military personnel, saw a large, triangular-shaped craft in the sky.\n\nOne of the most detailed reports came from a meteorological officer at RAF Shawbury, who described the object as being the size of a craft somewhere between a C-130 Hercules and a Boeing 747.\n\nIt emitted a low-frequency hum, and a beam of light appeared to be scanning the ground below.\n\n\u201cWe had dozens of witnesses to the Cosford sighting, including police and military personnel,\u201d Nick says.\n\n\u201cSome people even described the object as being like \u2018two Concorde aircraft glued together.\u2019 The most intriguing part of the case was the beam of light that seemed to track back and forth, almost like it was searching for something.\u201d\n\nNick\u2019s investigation into the sighting led to some theories, including the possibility that the sighting could have been related to the re-entry of a Russian rocket. However, this theory didn\u2019t fully explain all the reports, and Nick wasn\u2019t convinced it was the definitive answer.\n\nUltimately, Nick and his team were left with more questions than answers, he said: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t definitively explain what happened, but there were certain things that gave us pause for thought.\n\n\"The speeds and manoeuvres reported by the witnesses were orders of magnitude above anything that we had or anything that we knew our adversaries had.\n\n\u201cI thought, maybe, this really is the real deal. Maybe this is extraterrestrial.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a firm intelligence assessment, but it was one of the theories we put forward.\u201d\n\nUK trailing in UFO 'race'\n\nWhen it comes to how the UK and the US are handling UFO research, Nick is critical of the UK\u2019s lack of progress.\n\nWhile the US government has made significant strides in acknowledging and investigating UFOs in recent years, the UK has been far slower to act - something Nick believes this is a dangerous oversight.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, there was talk of a missile gap and a space race. Today, we have what I call a UFO gap,\u201d he argues.\n\n\u201cThe US is leading the way, and other countries are falling behind. Something is in our airspace, and we need to figure out what it is. If something can outpace your cutting-edge aerospace technology, it\u2019s a threat, but it could also be an opportunity.\u201d\n\nPope criticises the UK\u2019s decision to axe its UFO programme in 2009. \u201cI think that was a mistake,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt leaves a gap that adversaries could exploit. We\u2019ve seen this in recent incidents, like the Chinese spy balloon saga. If we\u2019re not keeping an eye on UFO sightings, we could miss important intelligence.\u201d\n\nFAMOUS UFO INCIDENTS The \u2018Night of the UFOs\u2019 is among many famous unexplained encounters with strange objects in the sky that have happened down the years. Perhaps the most striking was a video known as the 'Tic-Tac' \u2013 which showed an unidentified object being pursued by fighter planes. While flying off the coast of California 2004, two pilots from the USS Nimitz on a routine training mission spotted an object \"shaped like a 40ft Tic Tac sweet\". Then in 2005, a veteran pilot of an F/A - 18 fighter aircraft witnessed a raft of strange objects in the sky during a training exercise off the coast of Florida. The two videos were sensationally released by the Pentagon in 2017. Tragically the pursuit of UFOs has also claimed lives, notably that of US Air Force Captain Thomas Mantell. He died after being sent to chase a mysterious object in his fighter aircraft in 1948. Other encounters with the air force include a claim that UFOs disabled weapons at a nuclear base. Captain Robert Salas said the bizarre incident unfolded in 1967 while he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility at Montana\u2019s Malmstrom Air Force Base. US forces based in Britain also had an encounter with a strange glowing in the sky in Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk. Two airmen, Staff Sgt Jim Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, claim they got so close to a triangular craft they actually touched it. Earlier this year, US military documents were released showing how a warship was shadowed by two \"ball of light\" UFOs deepening the mystery around the case.\n\nIn contrast, the Pentagon has embraced UFO research through its All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which investigates UFOs, particularly military sightings.\n\nWhile the UK is peripherally involved through intelligence-sharing agreements like the Five Eyes Forum, Nick believes the UK needs to take a more proactive approach.\n\nHe claims it is time for the UK to reinstate its UFO desk and begin taking public reports again.\n\n\u201cSomething is in our airspace. Whether it\u2019s Russia, China, extraterrestrials, or something else, it\u2019s making us look foolish,\u201d Nick warns.\n\n\u201cWe need a proper UFO research program in the UK. We have the resources \u2014 radar systems, satellites, and space tracking. What we need is the political will to use them.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not looking at huge new costs \u2014 it\u2019s just a case of using what you have to investigate UFOs properly.\u201d\n\nChanging attitudes\n\nReflecting on his own journey, Nick admits that before he began working on the UFO desk, he hadn\u2019t given much thought to UFOs at all.\n\nHe was sceptical, and certainly not someone who actively believed in extraterrestrial life.\n\nBut his time working in the government\u2019s UFO desk opened his eyes to the possibility that there was something more to these sightings than misidentifications or hoaxes.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a true believer,\u201d he says, \u201cbut now I\u2019m much more open-minded. I don\u2019t rule anything out.\u201d\n\nHe notes that there seems to be a consistent pattern that suggests a \u201ccore phenomenon\u201d that might be underpinned by advanced intelligence and technology.\n\nThe potential knowledge that could be gained from a civilisation far more advanced than ours is something Nick considers too important to ignore.\n\nFor the ex-MoD man, even the possibility of such a discovery makes it worth investigating the phenomenon further.\n\n\u201cSceptics have to be right every day, but believers only need to be right once,\u201d he points out.\n\n\"If just one UFO sighting turns out to be genuine, the impact on humanity would be transformative. Whether it\u2019s extraterrestrials, time travellers, or something else entirely, the implications would be profound.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no part of society that wouldn\u2019t be deeply affected. If extraterrestrial life were confirmed, it would change everything\u2014from politics and religion to science, technology, and philosophy.\"\n\nHe continued: \"People will look back on that day as the moment everything changed. Millions of years from now, they\u2019ll say that\u2019s the day it happened.\u201d"

            "source": "PopSugar",
            "article_content": "Inspired by this perspective, I approached the Death Clock calculator with a healthy amount of fear and curiosity. The app asks you 29 quick multiple choice questions spanning topics like substance use, exercise habits , personal relationships, and mental health. It took me about five minutes to complete. Afterward, I held my breath and waited for the results, bracing myself for impact.\n\nWhat may seem like a morbid factoid to post on your Facebook page, however, is not necessarily as terrifying as it may initially appear. In fact, despite its intimidating facade, Death Clock actually wants to help people add years to their life . \"We're trying to make it fun and easy for people to do the things they need to do to live a longer life,\" Franson says. \"When I remember how short life is, it does two things. One is it helps me to be more present and really savor the time that I do have. And then two, it helps me to be motivated to live longer.\"\n\nNov. 7, 2094. Mark your calendars, because that's only 69 years, 342 days, and seven hours (give or take) before I kick the bucket at 95 years old . . . at least, according to AI. My death date is courtesy of Brent Franson's \" Death Clock \" \u2014 a mobile app designed to calculate your approximate time of death, based on a myriad of data points and lifestyle factors. \"What we've done is we've built a proprietary AI that's trained on just under 1,200 longevity studies that predicts the date of your death based on the way that you're currently living your life,\" Franson tells PS. \"But it also makes a prediction of how much longer it thinks you can live if you make changes to your life.\"\n\nIn the interest of transparency, the first time I completed my Death Clock calculation, I was given a death date of December 2090, which would make me 91 at my time of death. When I first took the Death Clock test, I was more stressed, eating more processed food, and in a relationship. When I took the questionnaire again a little over a month later, I was single, spending more time with friends, eating better, and exercising more consistently. Both times, I was shocked to see that AI expected me to live well into my 90s. I thought for sure I'd be somewhere in the 80s . . . maybe even late 70s. After this initial relief washed over me, a wave of panic quickly followed. What quality of life would I have at 90-something years old? Did I even want to live that long? Or was 60-something more years not enough?\n\nThis is where Death Clock really shines. Not only can the app offer you specific suggestions to add more years onto your life (although I think I'm just fine with 90), but it can also help make those years more enjoyable. \"We give you an evaluation,\" Franson says. \"Like, 'Hey, here are the ways that you're likely to die. Here are the areas where you're doing well. Here are lifestyle considerations, medical considerations.'\" You then receive a personalized longevity plan based on your results. This may include supplements, recommended cancer screenings, medical devices, or just topics to bring up at your next doctor's visit. There's a free three-day trial to unlock your full evaluation \u2014 including strengths, potential risks, and recommendations for a longer life \u2014 but after the trial, this information costs $15 a month or $60 a year to access.\n\nWhat to Consider\n\nDeath Clock is not a doctor, and while its algorithm is based on expert studies, it's not expert-backed. With this in mind, it's always best to speak with a healthcare professional before taking any medical advice, including new supplements, and significant changes to diet or lifestyle.\n\nAdditionally, although Death Clock did ask for some concrete data (like blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and the approximate lifespan of any living grandparents), I did notice details related to chronic disease, medical, and family history were a bit vague. To that point, I'm not entirely convinced that any one test can tell you with 100 percent certainty when you'll die. That said, all of Death Clock's questions were related to high-risk factors for longevity (sleep, stress, social engagement, etc.), and for it being such a quick questionnaire, I think Death Clock's estimate seems fairly accurate. Just remember, longevity is complicated, and there's likely a lot more to the story than a multiple choice-based app can surmise.\n\nWhat Experts Say\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about longevity, AI might be a good place to start, but it's not the end all be all. \"The most reliable information about longevity can be found in peer-reviewed medical journals, reputable health organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and academic institutions,\" says endocrinologist Maria Teresa Anton, MD. \"When researching longevity online, it's crucial to verify the credibility of the sources.\"\n\nDr. Anton specifically recommends looking for established medical institutions, peer-reviewed journals, and certified health professionals. \"Be cautious of anecdotal evidence and websites that promote quick fixes or miracle cures, as these are often not supported by scientific evidence,\" she says. And as always, it's best to discuss any personalized medical goals with a healthcare professional.\n\nMy Death Clock Results\n\nIn my case, Death Clock thinks I'm most likely to die from chronic disease, stroke risk, or other preventable (!) diseases. Some of my top suggestions included better sleep quality (a high-risk lifestyle factor), further processed food reduction, and increased social engagement. My strengths included regular cardio exercise and no substance use.\n\n\"It's rare that I've had somebody go through [Death Clock] and be like, 'I wish I didn't do that.' I've actually never had anybody say that,\" Franson says. \"We're all going to die. So the question is: how can we be informed and do everything we can\u2026to get the most out of the time that we do have?\" I'm not sure I have the answer just yet, but check back with me in 69 years.\n\nChandler Plante (she/her) is an assistant health and fitness editor for PS.

            "article_content": "At CES 2025, billed as \u201cthe most powerful tech event in the world,\u201d the German engineering and tech giant Bosch, announced a range of new AI-oriented initiatives. In particular, they focused on using artificial intelligence solutions in the spheres of eBiking, parenting support, smart home appliances, and AI automation to improve manufacturing efficiency.\n\nHighlights include the REVOL AI infant care system - an AI-assisted smart crib that helps parents to watch over and keep the baby safe through a variety of sensors, as well as AI-based software to help cyclists plan routes, AI-powered roadside assistance. Among other innovations were a range of smart home products like wall plugs, a thermostat, an air purifier, an AC system, a smart oven, as well as a smart fridge equipped with Alexa (via the Matter smart home connectivity standard).\n\nBosch also unveiled its new wrong-way driver warning cloud-based system that tracks vehicles and can tell if a vehicle is moving in the right direction. It can send out warnings to the car in question and to other drivers on the road. The company is working with Sirius XM Connect to incorporate this technology with millions of consumers who currently have Sirius XM service.\n\neBiking innovation\n\nIn the sphere of eBikes, where within 15 years, Bosch has become one of the leading makers of eBike drives and smart connected solutions, they look to transform the way communities approach mobility and experience cycling. At CES, Bosch debuted Battery Lock - a new solution that allows you to deactivate the eBike\u2019s battery when not in use using an app.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBosch also introduced Range Control, a feature of the eBike app that helps cyclists to plan routes by using AI assistance. It takes the user\u2019s riding behavior and a host of factors into account.\n\nIn further extension of its car-oriented technologies, Bosch has worked to develop software applications for the Le Mans Daytona Hybrid racing car. The Bosch system at its core involves RaceConnect, which provides actionable insights to the race team in real-time, and a unique brake-by-wire braking system that uses software to balance the braking torques with traditional braking.\n\nTechnology for the people\n\nIn its presentation, led by Dr. Tanja R\u00fcckert, the chief digital officer and member of the board of management of the Bosch Group, along with Paul Thomas, the President of Bosch North America, the company stressed that its focus is not to use its technologies, and AI in particular, to replace people but to improve people\u2019s lives.\n\nThe presenters highlighted how digital business became an integral part of the Bosch business. They aim to generate 6 billion euros over the next decade in software and services. Most of these would be based on AI. In evidence of how heavily Bosch is investing in AI, they shared that the company has already filed 1500 AI-related patents and is employing 5,000 AI experts. Bosch also takes the issue of growing AI skills of its employees very seriously. They created a dedicated AI Academy to train their entire workforce, with 65,000 associates so far completing the training.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nR\u00fcckert spoke of the importance to Bosch of building trust in new technologies - an essential part of their digital strategy, putting the focus on users. They regard it as extremely significant now with the advent of AI, with the company determined to make AI safe, robust, secure, explainable, and led by the Bosch AI code of ethics.\n\nThomas outlined investments made by Bosch in the United States, including a major HVAC acquisition, and contributing to the build-up of semiconductor manufacturing in the country as well as new product launches tailored to the American market.\n\nIn other news, for the first time, Bosch will be advertising during the upcoming Super Bowl."

            "article_content": "After finding a Ouija board in her new home, a woman has been experiencing strange happenings for the past three months.\n\nIn a five-minute video posted to social media, mother-of-two Brandi Nettleton claims to have \u201cfinally\u201d caught her suspicions on camera. She filmed the seemingly paranormal activity that she has been experiencing ever since she moved into her sister\u2019s house.\n\nFilming herself walking around her new place, Brandi tells viewers she's home alone with her daughter, while her son, who lives in the upstairs part of the house, has left to go to a party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a mimic here for a couple of weeks. When my daughter\u2019s not at home I hear her say my name and she\u2019s not there\u201d, she explains. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s at home but my son is not, and my son is the only one who lives upstairs. All night since he\u2019s been gone I keep hearing the door close but there\u2019s nobody up there.\u201d\n\nImage: Jam Press/@sassycaligirl2003) Jam Press/@sassycaligirl2003) Image: Jam Press/@sassycaligirl2003) Jam Press/@sassycaligirl2003)\n\nShe then reveals her plan to try and catch the sound on video, and sits in silence, still filming. She begins to talk about how she\u2019s been upstairs to check whenever similar things happen, when her dog begins to bark, which prompts her to slowly walk to the stairs leading up to her son\u2019s bedroom, with the camera facing the ceiling.\n\nViewers can then hear a loud and repetitive clicking sound, followed by a thud. Brandi reacts by walking up the stairs and showing the audience: \u201cLook, nobody\u2019s up here. Oh my god look, his door is closed.\u201d\n\nThe door to her son\u2019s bedroom then clicks open, untouched, and Brandi runs downstairs to tell her daughter what just happened. \u201cIt sounds like somebody\u2019s in your brother's room. I went up there to show that his door was closed. Tell me why his door opened when I went up there. I swear I ran down here by myself, I\u2019m recording it\u201d, she says.\n\nBoth of them then go upstairs to show, with a flashlight, that the upstairs bedroom is empty. Just as they are back on the stairs, the door clicks open again, making mother and daughter scream in horror.\n\nBrandi said she associates the strange occurrences to an Ouija board - an instrument some use to try to call spirits forward - she had found and thrown away upon moving in.\n\n\u201cI found out after my sister moved out that she had a Ouija board here and I found it when I was packing her stuff. I got rid of it right away. There are still things that go on almost every single night\u201d, she explained.\n\nBrandi\u2019s video was viewed by more than three million people across social media platforms, and part of the audience reacted by sharing advice, empathy for her situation, and similar situations they had been through.\n\n\u201cThis is the most in time realistic non staged video I think I\u2019ve seen\u201d, one commented. Another advised: \u201cRemember if you are scared they tend to react more\u201d.\n\nOne user shared: \u201cI lived in a home with three roommates. We all experienced it. The day we all decided to move out was when we heard it repeat. 'HELLO' four or five times as well as children giggling.\u201d\n\nA commenter joked that the \u201cmimic\u201d - believed by some to be a spiritual entity with the ability to imitate its surroundings or other creatures - would be happy with the family\u2019s scared reactions. Brandi then responded: \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t doubt it and what sucks is I respond to it because it\u2019s my daughter\u2019s voice and it\u2019s just an automatic response. I don\u2019t know how not to.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Sonic the Hedgehog 3 hit theaters late last month and has already grossed more than $300 million worldwide, pushing the film series based on Sega\u2019s popular video games past the one-billion mark and making it one of Paramount\u2019s biggest ongoing franchises.\n\nOn January 5, Paramount Pictures put out a press release confirming that the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog film franchise has now made over $1 billion at the box office. That means it\u2019s made more than Halloween, Paranormal Activity, and A Quiet Place.\n\nFor Paramount, Sonic has become a very important franchise at a time when the studio has struggled to squeeze massive blockbusters out of past winners, like Transformers and Star Trek. So it\u2019s not shocking that as Sonic crosses the 1-billion-dollar mark, Paramount is already working on a sequel. The next movie is reportedly arriving in 2027.\n\n\u201cThe Sonic the Hedgehog franchise has become an unstoppable cultural force with limitless potential,\u201d said Paramount Pictures President & CEO Brian Robbins. \u201cCongratulations to our partners at SEGA, our filmmaking team...who have revolutionized the heights that Sonic can reach, and the legions of loyal and devoted fans who have helped guide us every step of the way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt feels like a lifetime ago when the first Sonic the Hedgehog film teaser hit the web and we all got to see that original, ugly CG Sonic that was so monstrous, fans backlashed hard enough to force Paramount and Sega to change the character\u2019s look into something less awful. That first film ended up making $319 million at the box office.\n\nIn 2022, Sonic 2 hit theaters, receiving better reviews and making over $400 million. There was a Knuckles spin-off TV show in early 2024, but nobody talks about that. Then finally, in December, Paramount released Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which is one of the highest-rated video game movies in history and has already made more money than the first film in just about two weeks. Pretty good for a hedgehog that runs really fast.\n\n.\n\n\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,\u201d the scientist highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow up with Chiron,\n\n\u201cIt will come closer to us, and if we can study it at nearer distances and get better reads on the quantities and nature of the ices, silicates, and organics, we will be able to better understand how seasonal insolation variations and different illumination patterns can affect its behavior and its ice reservoir.\u201d"

            "article_content": "When Jin Yi (Jeanie) Tan told the school children she was supervising for a science outreach programme \u2018you can collect anything you want\u2019, she didn\u2019t expect one to bring in goose droppings. She also wasn\u2019t expecting the programme to lead them to a new cytotoxic peptide.\n\nTan, a fourth-year PhD candidate in Brian Murphy\u2019s lab from the University of Illinois Chicago, US, leads a team of researchers in an outreach collaboration with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, one of the city\u2019s oldest youth development organisations. With 21 locations, and 20,000 young members, the clubs provide resources and support to aid members\u2019 personal and professional development. So far the team has worked with two local branches: the Bartlett J McCartin club and the James R Jordan club, the latter of which is named after Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan\u2019s late father.\n\nThe 14-week after-school programme, termed the Chicago antibiotic discovery lab, offers middle school students (aged 11\u201313 ) from underrepresented communities, a hands-on learning experience searching for potential antibiotics in their own neighbourhoods . Funded by the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant that Tan received for her PhD, the programme teaches the fundamentals of microbiology research, from sample collection to laboratory analysis. Students are also introduced to environmental issues, engineering, robotics and related careers. \u2018We\u2019ve done four different cohorts of this programme, constantly tweaking stuff to make things better,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018One of our strengths is that the programme is very small, allowing us to give one-to-one mentoring and tailor the work to the students\u2019 interests.\u2019\n\nSemi-automated\n\nTan\u2019s PhD project focusses on finding new antibiotics to combat multi-drug resistance by harnessing antimicrobial toxins secreted by other bacteria. She has developed a pipeline for screening bioactive compounds from the natural environment, \u2018integrating things like robotics, bioassays and bioinformatics to create a streamlined workflow\u2019, she explains. This approach simplifies the initial stages of microbial drug discovery by allowing steps to be carried out in a semi-automated manner, making it safe and accessible enough to be taught to middle school students. \u2018The researchers were very good at mentoring the students \u2026 [the students] were constantly supervised and because of the robotics, had no interaction with hazardous bacteria,\u2019 adds Jonathon Rodriguez, the technology program manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago.\n\nThe mentor team encourages students to carry out each stage of the process autonomously \u2013 instilling a sense of ownership over their results. While some students collect samples from lake water or flowers, others get more creative, swabbing everything from air conditioning filters to playground slides. \u2018The kids are always collecting the weirdest stuff t hey can find,\u2019 says Tan.\n\nStudents then program a robot to isolate the bacterial colonies grown from their samples and test the ability of each one to prevent the growth of multi-drug resistant bacteria. \u2018At first when they look at the environmental bacteria plates, they are really grossed out,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018But after five minutes, they\u2019ll be looking really closely? Like \u201cwait, what\u2019s this one? Why is this one pink?\u201d It\u2019s exciting for them to be able to understand microbiology and that they can produce medicines.\u2019\n\nTan successfully isolated a new anti-bacterial compound from Pseudomonas idahonensis, a bacterium cultured from the goose dropping sample. It turned out to be a cyclic lipodepsipeptide that they named orfamide N . Using NMR and mass spectrometry analysis she elucidated the structure of the new bioactive molecule. It comprises 10 mixed D- and L-amino acids and a distinct lipid tail, which sets it apart from other known orfamides and is thought to contribute to its biological activity. While the peptide demonstrated minimal antibacterial activity, it showed cytotoxicity in bioassays against human cancer cell lines, warranting further investigation in its application for cancer therapy.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really happy and grateful that I was able to merge two big interests of mine and showed that this can happen. Biomedical research and Stem outreach can lead to a publication ,\u2019 says Tan. The research, published in the journal ACS Omega, lists the the student who collected the goose dropping sample as a co-author, underscoring their integral role in this discovery. \u2018The student was really excited about it,\u2019 adds Rodriguez.\n\nAs the project continues into its third year, the team hopes its approach can serve as a model for university\u2013community partnerships elsewhere. \u2018There is often a disconnect between a university and the neighbouring communities it should serve,\u2019 says Murphy. \u2018Both teams are learning about one another and building trust, and that barrier that typically exists between university and community is being systematically broken down.\u2019"

            "article_content": "OpenAI has announced that its primary focus for the coming year will be on developing \u201csuperintelligence,\u201d according to a blog post from Sam Altman. This has been described as AI with greater-than-human capabilities.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s current suite of products has a vast array of capabilities, Altman said that superintelligence will enable users to perform \u201canything else.\u201d He highlights accelerating scientific discovery as the primary example, which, he believes, will lead to the betterment of society.\n\n\u201cThis sounds like science fiction right now, and somewhat crazy to even talk about it. That\u2019s alright\u2014we\u2019ve been there before and we\u2019re OK with being there again,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe change of direction has been spurred by Altman\u2019s confidence in his company now knowing \u201chow to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it.\u201d AGI, or artificial general intelligence, is typically defined as a system that matches human capabilities, whereas superintelligence exceeds them.\n\nSEE: OpenAI\u2019s Sora: Everything You Need to Know\n\nAltman has eyed superintelligence for years \u2014 but concerns exist\n\nOpenAI has been referring to superintelligence for several years when discussing the risks of AI systems and aligning them with human values. In July 2023, OpenAI announced it was hiring researchers to work on containing superintelligent AI.\n\nThe team would reportedly devote 20% of OpenAI\u2019s total computing power to training what they call a human-level automated alignment researcher to keep future AI products in line. Concerns around superintelligent AI stem from how such a system could prove impossible to control and may not share human values.\n\n\u201cWe need scientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us,\u201d wrote OpenAI Head of Alignment Jan Leike and co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever in a blog post at the time.\n\nSEE: OpenAI and Anthropic Sign Deals With U.S. AI Safety Institute\n\nBut, four months after creating the team, another company post revealed they \u201cstill (did) not know how to reliably steer and control superhuman AI systems\u201d and didn\u2019t have a way of \u201cpreventing (a superintelligent AI) from going rogue.\u201d\n\nIn May, OpenAI\u2019s superintelligence safety team was disbanded and several senior personnel left due to the concern that \u201csafety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products,\u201d including Jan Leike and the team\u2019s co-lead Ilya Sutskever. The team\u2019s work was absorbed by OpenAI\u2019s other research efforts, according to Wired.\n\nDespite this, Altman highlighted the importance of safety to OpenAI in his blog post. \u201cWe continue to believe that the best way to make an AI system safe is by iteratively and gradually releasing it into the world, giving society time to adapt and co-evolve with the technology, learning from experience, and continuing to make the technology safer,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the importance of being world leaders on safety and alignment research, and in guiding that research with feedback from real world applications.\u201d\n\nThe path to superintelligence may still be years away\n\nThere is disagreement about how long it will be until superintelligence is achieved. The November 2023 blog post said it could develop within a decade. But nearly a year later, Altman said it could be \u201ca few thousand days away.\u201d\n\nHowever, Brent Smolinski, IBM VP and global head of Technology and Data Strategy, said this was \u201ctotally exaggerated,\u201d in a company post from September 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re even in the right zip code for getting to superintelligence,\u201d he said.\n\nAI still requires much more data than humans to learn a new capability, is limited in the scope of capabilities, and does not possess consciousness or self-awareness, which Smolinski views as a key indicator of superintelligence.\n\nHe also claims that quantum computing could be the only way we might unlock AI that surpasses human intelligence. At the start of the decade, IBM predicted that quantum would begin to solve real business problems before 2030.\n\nSEE: Breakthrough in Quantum Cloud Computing Ensures its Security and Privacy\n\nAltman predicts AI agents will join the workforce in 2025\n\nAI agents are semi-autonomous generative AI that can chain together or interact with applications to carry out instructions or make decisions in an unstructured environment. For example, Salesforce uses AI agents to call sales leads.\n\nTechRepublic predicted at the end of the year that the use of AI agents will surge in 2025. Altman echoes this in his blog post, saying \u201cwe may see the first AI agents \u2018join the workforce\u2019 and materially change the output of companies.\u201d\n\nSEE: IBM: Enterprise IT Facing Imminent AI Agent Revolution\n\nAccording to a research paper by Gartner, the first industry agents to dominate will be software development. \u201cExisting AI coding assistants gain maturity, and AI agents provide the next set of incremental benefits,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nBy 2028, 33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI, up from less than 1% in 2024, according to the Gartner paper. A fifth of online store interactions and at least 15% of day-to-day work decisions will be conducted by agents by that year.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to superintelligence in the true sense of the word,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and empowerment, is so important.\u201d"

Altman said the post was inspired by a recent interview he gave to Bloomberg, which was published on Sunday as well.\n\n\"Ron Conway and Brian Chesky went so far above and beyond the call of duty that I'm not even sure how to describe it,\" Altman wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAltman was fired as OpenAI's CEO on November 17, 2023. The company's board said in a statement that it was removing Altman because he \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board\" but did not elaborate further.\n\nAltman returned as CEO on November 22, 2023, after nearly all of OpenAI's staff threatened to quit if he wasn't reinstated.\n\nIn his blog post, Altman said \"there were a lot of people who did incredible and gigantic amounts of work\" to help him and OpenAI when he was ousted, but Conway and Chesky \"stood out from all others.\"\n\nAD\n\n\"I've of course heard stories about Ron's ability and tenaciousness for years and I've spent a lot of time with Brian over the past couple of years getting a huge amount of help and advice,\" Altman wrote.\n\n\"But there's nothing quite like being in the foxhole with people to see what they can really do,\" he continued. \"I am reasonably confident OpenAI would have fallen apart without their help; they worked around the clock for days until things were done.\"\n\nConway and Chesky, Altman wrote, gave him \"great advice\" and \"stopped me from making several mistakes.\" The pair also tapped on their vast networks to assist him, Altman added.\n\nAD\n\n\"I thought I knew what it looked like to support a founder and a company, and in some small sense I did,\" Altman wrote. \"But I have never before seen, or even heard of, anything like what these guys did, and now I get more fully why they have the legendary status they do.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Conway and Chesky did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nConway and Chesky are longtime friends of Altman and were one of the first people he called after OpenAI fired him.\n\nAD\n\nWhat happened at OpenAI today is a Board coup that we have not seen the likes of since 1985 when the then-Apple board pushed out Steve Jobs. It is shocking; it is irresponsible; and it does not do right by Sam & Greg or all the builders in OpenAI. \u2014 Ron Conway (@RonConway) November 18, 2023\n\nConway was also one of Altman's guest speakers when the latter taught a class on startups at Stanford University in 2014.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAltman and Chesky's friendship, meanwhile, goes back more than a decade. Altman mentored Chesky when Airbnb was a part of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator.\n\nWhen Altman was fired from OpenAI, he briefly considered launching another AI startup but was discouraged by Conway and Chesky, The New York Times reported in December 2023.\n\nAD\n\n\"You should be willing to fight back at least a little more,\" Chesky told Altman, per The Times.\n\nOpenAI's board, Conway later told Time magazine, had fired Altman for \"nitpicky, unfireable, not even close to fireable offenses.\"\n\nThe billionaire venture capitalist had spoken to the magazine as part of a profile on Altman that was published in December 2023.\n\nAD\n\n\"It is reckless and irresponsible for a board to fire a founder over emotional reasons,\" Conway told the outlet."

            "article_content": "The big picture: A debate surrounding Northeastern's computer science curriculum highlights the ongoing challenges in higher education about how to best prepare students for rapidly evolving technical fields. While Python is currently popular in the industry, the choice of programming language for teaching should be based on pedagogical merit rather than current trends, writes one student.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for The Huntington News, Derek Kaplan, a fourth-year Computer Science student at Northeastern University, presented a compelling argument about the future of computer science education at his institution. The piece comes in response to Northeastern's announcement of a complete overhaul of its computer science curriculum.\n\nKaplan makes the case that the rapidly evolving nature of the tech industry requires a focus on timeless principles rather than current trends and that an effective curriculum should emphasize fundamental principles that are widely applicable, enabling students to easily adapt to new technologies in their future careers. \"A curriculum focused on current industry trends risks becoming obsolete before students even graduate,\" he noted.\n\nNortheastern's current curriculum, particularly the \"Fundies\" courses, focuses on systematic program design and problem-solving skills. These courses teach a design recipe that provides a consistent formula for tackling unfamiliar problems, training students to reason about code \"rather than to mindlessly write it,\" he said.\n\nThe \"point of Fundies is \u2026 to teach program design skills that can be applied using any programming language\u2026 A student who does well in Fundies will have no difficulty applying the same skills to Python or any other language.\"\n\nHowever, the proposed changes to the curriculum have raised concerns. The plan is to phase out core courses like Fundies 1, Fundies 2, and Object-Oriented Design in favor of new courses primarily teaching Python, which Kaplan sees as potentially misguided.\n\nRacket, the language currently used in introductory courses, was chosen for its teaching-oriented features, which Python lacks. Kaplan also views as problematic the decision to allow students to place out of new courses with AP Computer Science credit, as AP courses do not teach the same systematic design skills as Northeastern's current introductory courses.\n\nThese changes suggest a shift away from systematic program design as a central aspect of the curriculum, which could leave students ill-prepared for advanced coursework and future careers. The Object-Oriented Design course, while challenging for many students, teaches essential skills such as working with code written by others and managing large software projects.\n\nKaplan also questions the motivations behind the curriculum change, suggesting that it may be driven by a desire to make the core curriculum easier and reduce the number of students withdrawing from certain courses.\n\n\"I know one professor who has been telling students that the college wants to reduce the number of students who withdraw from Fundies 2 and Object-Oriented Design. While this is an understandable sentiment, it would be a mistake to remove the most important parts of the curriculum to do so.\"\n\nFinally, he notes that experienced teaching assistants could provide valuable input into the curriculum revision process. Their unique perspective, having both taken the courses and helped other students succeed, could help ensure that core principles are not compromised while allowing for beneficial changes.\n\n\"As a former teaching assistant, or TA, for Object-Oriented Design, I have seen many students struggle through the class. But I have also seen those same students become better programmers because of what they learn in that class.\""

They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,\u201d the scientist highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow up with Chiron,\n\n\u201cIt will come closer to us, and if we can study it at nearer distances and get better reads on the quantities and nature of the ices, silicates, and organics, we will be able to better understand how seasonal insolation variations and different illumination patterns can affect its behavior and its ice reservoir.\u201d"

            "article_content": "When Jin Yi (Jeanie) Tan told the school children she was supervising for a science outreach programme \u2018you can collect anything you want\u2019, she didn\u2019t expect one to bring in goose droppings. She also wasn\u2019t expecting the programme to lead them to a new cytotoxic peptide.\n\nTan, a fourth-year PhD candidate in Brian Murphy\u2019s lab from the University of Illinois Chicago, US, leads a team of researchers in an outreach collaboration with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago, one of the city\u2019s oldest youth development organisations. With 21 locations, and 20,000 young members, the clubs provide resources and support to aid members\u2019 personal and professional development. So far the team has worked with two local branches: the Bartlett J McCartin club and the James R Jordan club, the latter of which is named after Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan\u2019s late father.\n\nThe 14-week after-school programme, termed the Chicago antibiotic discovery lab, offers middle school students (aged 11\u201313 ) from underrepresented communities, a hands-on learning experience searching for potential antibiotics in their own neighbourhoods . Funded by the Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant that Tan received for her PhD, the programme teaches the fundamentals of microbiology research, from sample collection to laboratory analysis. Students are also introduced to environmental issues, engineering, robotics and related careers. \u2018We\u2019ve done four different cohorts of this programme, constantly tweaking stuff to make things better,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018One of our strengths is that the programme is very small, allowing us to give one-to-one mentoring and tailor the work to the students\u2019 interests.\u2019\n\nSemi-automated\n\nTan\u2019s PhD project focusses on finding new antibiotics to combat multi-drug resistance by harnessing antimicrobial toxins secreted by other bacteria. She has developed a pipeline for screening bioactive compounds from the natural environment, \u2018integrating things like robotics, bioassays and bioinformatics to create a streamlined workflow\u2019, she explains. This approach simplifies the initial stages of microbial drug discovery by allowing steps to be carried out in a semi-automated manner, making it safe and accessible enough to be taught to middle school students. \u2018The researchers were very good at mentoring the students \u2026 [the students] were constantly supervised and because of the robotics, had no interaction with hazardous bacteria,\u2019 adds Jonathon Rodriguez, the technology program manager at Boys and Girls Clubs of Chicago.\n\nThe mentor team encourages students to carry out each stage of the process autonomously \u2013 instilling a sense of ownership over their results. While some students collect samples from lake water or flowers, others get more creative, swabbing everything from air conditioning filters to playground slides. \u2018The kids are always collecting the weirdest stuff t hey can find,\u2019 says Tan.\n\nStudents then program a robot to isolate the bacterial colonies grown from their samples and test the ability of each one to prevent the growth of multi-drug resistant bacteria. \u2018At first when they look at the environmental bacteria plates, they are really grossed out,\u2019 says Tan. \u2018But after five minutes, they\u2019ll be looking really closely? Like \u201cwait, what\u2019s this one? Why is this one pink?\u201d It\u2019s exciting for them to be able to understand microbiology and that they can produce medicines.\u2019\n\nTan successfully isolated a new anti-bacterial compound from Pseudomonas idahonensis, a bacterium cultured from the goose dropping sample. It turned out to be a cyclic lipodepsipeptide that they named orfamide N . Using NMR and mass spectrometry analysis she elucidated the structure of the new bioactive molecule. It comprises 10 mixed D- and L-amino acids and a distinct lipid tail, which sets it apart from other known orfamides and is thought to contribute to its biological activity. While the peptide demonstrated minimal antibacterial activity, it showed cytotoxicity in bioassays against human cancer cell lines, warranting further investigation in its application for cancer therapy.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really happy and grateful that I was able to merge two big interests of mine and showed that this can happen. Biomedical research and Stem outreach can lead to a publication ,\u2019 says Tan. The research, published in the journal ACS Omega, lists the the student who collected the goose dropping sample as a co-author, underscoring their integral role in this discovery. \u2018The student was really excited about it,\u2019 adds Rodriguez.\n\nAs the project continues into its third year, the team hopes its approach can serve as a model for university\u2013community partnerships elsewhere. \u2018There is often a disconnect between a university and the neighbouring communities it should serve,\u2019 says Murphy. \u2018Both teams are learning about one another and building trust, and that barrier that typically exists between university and community is being systematically broken down.\u2019"

NVIDIA AI Blueprints, built on NIM microservices, provide preconfigured reference workflows for digital humans, content creation and more.\n\nLAS VEGAS, Jan. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CES -- NVIDIA today announced foundation models running locally on NVIDIA RTX\u2122 AI PCs that supercharge digital humans, content creation, productivity and development.\n\nThese models \u2014 offered as NVIDIA NIM\u2122 microservices \u2014 are accelerated by new GeForce RTX\u2122 50 Series GPUs, which feature up to 3,352 trillion operations per second of AI performance and 32GB of VRAM. Built on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, RTX 50 Series are the first consumer GPUs to add support for FP4 compute, boosting AI inference performance by 2x and enabling generative AI models to run locally in a smaller memory footprint, compared with previous-generation hardware.\n\nGeForce\u2122 has long been a vital platform for AI developers. The first GPU-accelerated deep learning network, AlexNet, was trained on the GeForce GTX\u2122 580 in 2012 \u2014 and last year, over 30% of published AI research papers cited the use of GeForce RTX.\n\nNow, with generative AI and RTX AI PCs, anyone can be a developer. A new wave of low-code and no-code tools, such as AnythingLLM, ComfyUI, Langflow and LM Studio, enable enthusiasts to use AI models in complex workflows via simple graphical user interfaces.\n\nNIM microservices connected to these GUIs will make it effortless to access and deploy the latest generative AI models. NVIDIA AI Blueprints, built on NIM microservices, provide easy-to-use, preconfigured reference workflows for digital humans, content creation and more.\n\nTo meet the growing demand from AI developers and enthusiasts, every top PC manufacturer and system builder is launching NIM-ready RTX AI PCs with GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.\n\n\u201cAI is advancing at light speed, from perception AI to generative AI and now agentic AI,\u201d said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \u201cNIM microservices and AI Blueprints give PC developers and enthusiasts the building blocks to explore the magic of AI.\u201d\n\nMaking AI NIMble\n\nFoundation models \u2014 neural networks trained on immense amounts of raw data \u2014 are the building blocks for generative AI.\n\nNVIDIA will release a pipeline of NIM microservices for RTX AI PCs from top model developers such as Black Forest Labs, Meta, Mistral and Stability AI. Use cases span large language models (LLMs), vision language models, image generation, speech, embedding models for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), PDF extraction and computer vision.\n\n\u201cGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs with FP4 compute will unlock a massive range of models that can run on PC, which were previously limited to large data centers,\u201d said Robin Rombach, CEO of Black Forest Labs. \u201cMaking FLUX an NVIDIA NIM microservice increases the rate at which AI can be deployed and experienced by more users, while delivering incredible performance.\u201d\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Crooks start most payments fraud by trying to figure out if the crime is actually worth the effort, sending small probes to see if there is enough money to steal. Stripe contends there is a way to gain the upper hand by leaning on machine learning.\n\nThe payments company says the technology has reduced a type of attack called \"card testing\" by 80% in the past two years. That has come as Stripe's yearly payment volume has grown from about $500 billion to more than $1 trillion during that time, a jump in payments activity that theoretically makes card testing easier.\n\nCrooks use card testing to measure how valuable a stolen card can be by making small phony payments, usually a couple of dollars or less, trying to bury a fraudulent transaction in a sea of legitimate payments, where it's less likely to be noticed.\n\nIf these payments go through without being flagged, the fraudsters then make incrementally larger purchases, relying on the initial \"test\" payments that have beaten a company's fraud guard to pave the way for larger theft.\n\n\"Card testing is where most fraud begins,\" said Emily Sands, head of information at Stripe, where she is responsible for leading a department that develops uses for data in decision-making and automation. \"Bad actors try to get to which cards can be used in the future.\"\n\n\n\nAdministering the exam\n\nCard testing is the most prevalent type of payment fraud, according to Chargebacks 911 .\n\nWhile the losses due to card testing alone are minimal, the technique is a gateway to $205 billion in e-commerce fraud in the first half of the 2020s, according to Juniper Research , which stresses the importance of determining the validity of a payment as key to halting deeper crime.\n\n\"It's a big threat and challenging to detect,\" Sands said. \"Crooks are clever. They hide attacks in businesses that make or receive lots of payments. The record of payments in this case may not look as spiky as for a business or small company. So there's not a sudden shift in the pace of transactions.\"\n\nThere are two major types of card tests. A verification attack involves a crook trying to make small purchases on stolen card accounts to see which ones have been canceled or expired. An enumeration attack, which is gaining steam as crooks use more sophisticated technology, involves \"guessing\" at card numbers in a rapid-fire manner to spot active cards and to circumvent the cards' blocking function.\n\nStripe uses machine learning, or a form of artificial intelligence, to estimate the overall prevalence of card testing on its platform, which enables the company to update its risk systems daily. The payment company additionally uses machine learning to estimate where card testing is likely to be taking place, such as businesses, issuers or a type of purchase or payment. This helps determine if a \"rush\" of transactions are card testing or a spike in payments due to a marketing campaign, for instance.\n\nOther tests include vetting individual transactions to spot signs of card testing. This technology enables Stripe to label breakthroughs, or \"successful\" card tests. That is combined with intelligence from new attack types, analyses that spot fraud patterns and manual reviews. This produces a set of transactions or transaction types that are labeled card-testing fraud, which is then fed into machine-learning models for rapid training using an engineering platform.\n\n\"Crooks are constantly changing methods,\" Sands said. \"Machine learning enables rapid retraining to spot new attack methods. \"This detection adds new features that get fed back into the AI model.\"\n\n\n\nRise of the machines\n\nWhile card testing has existed for years, it has increased over the past few years in concert with the economic crisis that accompanied the Covid-19 pandemic, which also catalyzed a rapid expansion in online payments. That has attracted payment and technology companies to develop products designed to halt the attacks. Verifi sells tools that help merchants adjust credit card authorization response messages, which can combat card testing. It also offers card verification value checks as well as geolocation and biometric analysis. Another Verifi product uses new 3D Secure protocols that are designed for digital commerce. JPMorgan Chase , Kount and Chargebacks 911 also offer services to mitigate card testing fraud.\n\nFirms are increasingly using large language models, or an advanced form of AI that's better at deciphering text, to detect similar intent, word usage and patterns in any textual fields of transactions such as disputes, chargebacks, etc. across different transactions, according to Andras Cser, a vice president and principal analyst at Forrester. The emerging technology also includes using machine learning and algorithms to parse large amounts of merchant and issuer data, he said.\n\n\"This is the motivation for Visa to acquire Featurespace ,\" Cser said.\n\nBattling card testing fraud is a great application for machine learning and advanced data management, according to David Mattei, strategic advisor for the fraud and anti-money-laundering practice at Datos Insights.\n\n\"The one thing in common I see with these newer card testing detection solutions is that they are coming from industry players considered to be at the network level,\" Mattei said, adding these firms view card authorization traffic across many merchants and financial institutions. Due to the nature of card testing, it is very helpful to have that 50,000 foot perspective to detect card testing attacks. Stripe is in a good position to offer this kind of solution.\"\n\n"

Combat footage geolocated by military analysts indicated that Ukraine was trying to break through Russian defenses in at least three directions.\n\nIt is the first significant attempt by Ukrainian troops to advance in Kursk since the original incursion in August. Since then, Russia has regained roughly half of the territory it lost.\n\nAt the same time, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed on Monday that its forces had seized control of Kurakhove, an important but shattered industrial town, further closing in on Ukrainian forces in the southern Donbas region after more than two months of withering bombardments and heavy fighting."

The Nifty Midcap Select fell 2.00 per cent to 12,749.90, while the banking sector indices also faced significant losses with Nifty Bank down 1.61 per cent at 50,167.95 and Nifty Financial Services declining 1.35 per cent to 23,415.20.\n\nMarket breadth remained heavily negative with 3,223 stocks declining against 734 advances on the BSE. The number of stocks hitting lower circuit at 365 significantly outnumbered those touching upper circuit at 228. Despite the broad market weakness, 159 stocks managed to hit their 52-week highs, while 67 touched their 52-week lows.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Apollo Hospitals emerged as the top gainer on the NSE, rising 0.91 per cent, followed by ICICI Bank and Titan with modest gains of 0.15 per cent and 0.05 per cent respectively. The major losers included Tata Steel (-4.18 per cent), BPCL (-3.46 per cent), Adani Enterprises (-3.22 per cent), Kotak Bank (-3.10 per cent), and Trent (-3.05 per cent).\n\nThe market sentiment was affected by news of two HMPV cases detected in Karnataka, both involving infants. The Union Health Ministry confirmed that the cases were identified through routine surveillance, with both patients admitted to Baptist Hospital, Bengaluru, for bronchopneumonia. Neither patient had any international travel history.\n\nWhile the Health Ministry maintained that the HMPV strain is already in global circulation and that there has been no unusual surge in respiratory illnesses, the news appeared to trigger concerns among investors, leading to broad-based selling across sectors.\n\nThe market reaction comes despite the Ministry\u2019s assurance of preparedness and ongoing monitoring through the ICMR and IDSP network, with support from the WHO in tracking the situation in China."

            "article_content": "Only 19 per cent of Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country in Gallup polling in December 2024. PHOTO: REUTERS\n\n\u2013 To hear US President-elect Donald Trump tell it, he is about to take over a nation ravaged by crisis, a desolate hellscape of crime, chaos and economic hardship. \u201cOur country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the world!\u201d he declared on social media last week.\n\nBut by many traditional metrics, the America that Trump will inherit from President Joe Biden when he takes the oath for a second time, two weeks from Jan 6, is actually in better shape than that bequeathed to any newly elected president since Mr George W. Bush came into office in 2001.\n\nFor the first time since that transition 24 years ago, there will be no US troops at war overseas on Inauguration Day. New data reported in the past few days indicates that murders are way down, illegal immigration at the southern border has fallen even below where it was when Trump left office and roaring stock markets finished their best two years in a quarter-century.\n\nJobs are up, wages are rising and the economy is growing as fast as it did during Trump\u2019s presidency. Unemployment is as low as it was just before the Covid-19 pandemic and near its historic best. Domestic energy production is higher than it has ever been.\n\nThe manufacturing sector has more jobs than under any president since Mr Bush. Drug overdose deaths have fallen for the first time in years. Even inflation, the scourge of the Biden presidency, has returned closer to normal, although prices remain higher than they were four years ago.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is inheriting an economy that is about as good as it ever gets,\u201d said Mr Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe US economy is the envy of the rest of the world, as it is the only significant economy that is growing more quickly post-pandemic than pre-pandemic.\u201d\n\nThose positive trends were not enough to swing a sour electorate behind US Vice-President Kamala Harris in the November election, reflecting a substantial gap between what statistics say and what ordinary Americans appear to feel about the state of the country. And the US clearly faces some major challenges that will confront Trump as he retakes power.\n\nThe terrorist attack that killed 15 people in New Orleans early on New Year\u2019s Day, carried out by an American man who said he had joined the ISIS extremist group, served as a reminder that the group \u2013 which Trump likes to boast he defeated during his previous term \u2013 remains a threat and an inspiration to radicalised lone wolves. The wars in Ukraine and in the Gaza Strip are daunting challenges even without US troops engaged in combat there.\n\nThanks in part to Covid-19 relief spending by both Trump and Mr Biden, the national debt has ballooned so much that it now represents a larger share of the economy than it has in generations, other than during the pandemic itself. Families remain pressed by the cost of living, including housing, healthcare and college tuition. The cost of petrol , while down from its peak, is still about 70 US cents per gallon higher than when Mr Biden took office.\n\nMoreover, Americans remain as divided as they have been in many years \u2013 politically, ideologically, economically, racially and culturally. As healthy as the country may be economically and otherwise, a variety of scholars, surveys and other indicators suggest the US is struggling to come together behind a common view of its national identity, either at home or abroad.\n\nIndeed, many Americans do not perceive the country to be doing as well as the data suggests, either because they do not see it in their own lives, they do not trust the statistics or they accept the dystopian view promoted by Trump and amplified by a fragmented, choose-your-own-news media and online ecosphere.\n\nOnly 19 per cent of Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country in Gallup polling in December 2024. In another Gallup survey in September, 52 per cent of Americans said they and their own family were worse off than four years ago, a higher proportion than felt that way in the presidential election years of 1984, 1992, 2004, 2012 or 2020.\n\nIt was in Trump\u2019s political interest, of course, to encourage that sentiment and appeal to it during 2024 \u2019s campaign. He was hardly the first challenger to emphasise the negative to defeat an incumbent president.\n\nDwight Eisenhower disparaged the state of the country when he first ran for president in 1952, much to the irritation of president Harry S. Truman, only to have John F. Kennedy do the same to him when running in 1960.\n\nKennedy hammered away at a \u201cmissile gap\u201d with the Soviet Union that did not exist, then after winning declared that the US was in \u201cits hour of maximum danger\u201d, in contrast to Eisenhower\u2019s view of his security record.\n\n\u201cThis is a contrast you oftentimes find,\u201d said historian Michael Beschloss, who has written nine books on the American presidency. \u201cCandidates who are running against incumbent presidents or sitting governments make it sound much worse than it is.\u201d\n\nStill, few have been as extreme in their negative descriptions as Trump, or as resistant to fact-checking. He has suggested falsely that immigration, crime and inflation are out of control, attributed the New Orleans incident to lax border policies even though the attacker was an American born in Texas and as recently as Jan 4 called the country \u201ca total mess\u201d.\n\nYet Trump is moving back into the White House with an enviable hand to play, one that other presidents would have dearly loved on their opening day. President Ronald Reagan inherited double-digit inflation and an unemployment rate twice as high as today. President Barack Obama inherited two foreign wars and an epic financial crisis. Mr Biden inherited a devastating pandemic and the resulting economic turmoil.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s stepping into an improving situation,\u201d Dr William J. Antholis, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Centre of Public Affairs, which has studied presidential transitions, said of Trump.\n\nDr Antholis compared the situation with then President Bill Clinton\u2019s arrival in 1993, when he took over a growing economy and a new post-Cold War order. While the country had already begun recovering from recession during the 1992 election, many voters did not yet feel it and punished President George H.W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThe fundamentals of the economy had turned just before the election, and kept moving in the right direction when Clinton took over,\u201d Dr Antholis recalled.\n\nMuch as it did for the first Mr Bush\u2019s team, the disconnect between macro trends and individual perceptions proved enormously frustrating to Mr Biden and Ms Harris, who failed to persuade voters during the 2024 election that the country was doing better than commonly believed. Rattling off statistics and boasting about the success of \u201cBidenomics\u201d did not resonate with voters who did not see it the same way.\n\n\u201cOf course, not everyone is enjoying good economic times, as many low-middle income households are struggling financially, and the nation has mounting fiscal challenges,\u201d Mr Zandi said. \u201cBut taking the economy in its totality, it rarely performs better than it is now as President Trump takes office.\u201d\n\nMr Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said the latest reports demonstrated that Mr Biden\u2019s policies are working and argued that Republicans should not seek to repeal them once they take control of the presidency and both houses of Congress.\n\n\u201cAfter inheriting an economy in free fall and skyrocketing violent crime, President Biden is proud to hand his successor the best-performing economy on earth, the lowest violent crime rates in over 50 years, and the lowest border crossings in over four years,\u201d Mr Bates said.\n\nMs Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump, responded by citing the election: \u201cAmericans delivered an overwhelming Election Day rebuke of the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s abysmal track record: communities being overrun with millions of unvetted migrants who walked over Biden\u2019s open border, lower real wages, and declining trust in increasingly politicised law enforcement agencies that are unable to even publish accurate crime data.\u201d\n\nTrump does not have to share a positive view of the situation to benefit from it. When he takes office on Jan 20, absent the unexpected, he will not face the sort of major immediate action-forcing crisis that, say, Mr Obama did in needing to rescue the economy from the brink of another Great Depression.\n\nTrump instead will have more latitude to pursue favoured policies such as mass deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally or tariffs on foreign imported goods. And if past is prologue, he may eventually begin extolling the state of the economy to claim successes for his policies.\n\nHe has already taken credit for recent increases in stock prices even before assuming office. He has a demonstrated skill for self-promotion that eluded Mr Biden, enabling him to persuade many Americans that the economy during his first term was even better than it actually was.\n\nAt the same time, with unemployment, crime, border crossings and even inflation already pretty low, it may be difficult for Trump to improve on them significantly. Trump obliquely seemed to acknowledge as much when he noted in a post-election interview with Time magazine that he may not be able to live up to his campaign pledge to lower grocery prices. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to bring things down once they\u2019re up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nOn the contrary, Trump faces the risk that the economy goes in the other direction. Some specialists have warned that a tariff-driven trade war with major economic partners could, for instance, reignite inflation.\n\nDr N. Gregory Mankiw, an economics professor at Harvard University and chair of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under the second Mr Bush, recalled that even his former boss faced significant challenges when he took office in 2001 as the economy was already heading into a relatively mild recession following the bust of the dot-com boom.\n\n\u201cThere are no similar storm clouds on the horizon right now,\u201d Dr Mankiw said. \u201cThat is certainly lucky for Trump. On the other hand, all presidents must deal with unexpected shocks to the economy. We just don\u2019t know yet what kind of shocks President Trump will have to handle.\u201d NYTIMES\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you."

            "article_content": "HERE_AWS\n\nHERE and AWS\n\nLas Vegas, CES 2025 \u2013 HERE Technologies (HERE) and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced their new collaboration and cloud infrastructure agreement, to provide a scalable and streamlined solution for automakers\u2019 development of location-aware software. This collaboration will advance Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) development and combining AWS technologies with HERE mapping solutions will help accelerate the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Automated Driving (AD), and new digital car experiences.\n\nLocation technology plays a pivotal role in the advanced software powering the vehicles of today and will continue to grow in importance for SDVs moving forward. For example, live mapping location technology that is rich in detail and quality is often required to power numerous functions across the digital cabin and vehicle, from navigation and location-based services to electrified drivetrains, and ADAS and AD capabilities. These data-intensive operations can be supported seamlessly and scaled easily with AWS, enabling faster software development times and reducing the time-to-market for new innovations and services.\n\nBuilding a next-generation, AI-powered mapping system in the cloud\n\nFor nearly a decade, HERE has been using AWS for its core cloud infrastructure, data platform, analytics, and the deployment of its proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models. AWS\u2019s high-performance and cost effective compute infrastructure has also enabled HERE\u2019s rapid deployment of its unified map architecture. This architecture leverages HERE\u2019s AI and ML models to automate, update, and enhance its IoT sensor data-derived mapmaking that processes hundreds of millions of kilometers of vehicle probe and sensor data every hour. Through this new, expanded collaboration, HERE can offer automakers a comprehensive set of cloud-native tools and technologies that help accelerate development of new automotive innovations, such as improved active safety features and infotainment systems, while delivering industry-leading location technology to better address complex navigation requirements, including multi-stop electric (EV) charging.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWith HERE\u2019s live mapping, navigation, and connected mobility services built on the scalable, highly available, and reliable global infrastructure provided by AWS, HERE customers are able to better address high-performance vehicle routing challenges, improve EV driving efficiency and battery range accuracy, and optimize driving routes. These capabilities are enabling HERE\u2019s automotive customers to manage complex data aggregation, testing, and processing workflows to enable new, hands-free driving and digital cabin features, enhancing the overall driving experience.\n\nMaking it easier and more cost-efficient to test new driving technologies\n\nAWS and HERE\u2019s collaboration will advance ADAS and AD development by addressing critical challenges and accelerating innovation. For example, today, HERE launched SceneXtract, a solution that removes the need for manually searching, locating, and converting real-world environments into simulation-ready scenes, which is required for testing and validating the performance of ADAS and AD systems before they can be used in real-world deployments.\n\nUsing the highly accurate and continuously updated map data from HERE HD Live Map along with AWS natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI services, including Amazon Bedrock, automotive developers can now quickly locate and export HERE HD Live Map data into scenes for testing. This new solution reduces the time, effort, and cost required to prepare new simulations for ADAS and AD testing, helping the automotive industry develop and deploy these driving technologies faster and more efficiently. These simulations will help improve ADAS and AD systems, reducing the cognitive load on drivers and enhancing vehicle responsiveness to road conditions.\n\n\u201cLocation technology is at the heart of the automotive industry's software-defined vehicle revolution, and HERE's collaboration with AWS is boosting our ability to deliver game-changing tools that dramatically accelerate this complex transformation for our customers. By fusing HERE\u2019s industry-leading location intelligence with AWS's cloud capabilities and global reach, we're empowering automakers to rapidly evolve their vehicles into cutting-edge software platforms. Our work with AWS enables our customers to leverage our state-of-the-art location technology for faster software development and real-time data analytics throughout the entire SDV lifecycle, propelling the industry into a new era of automotive excellence,\" said Mike Nefkens, CEO at HERE.\n\n\u201cThe future of the auto industry is linked to technological advancement and invention, and our collaboration with HERE is a powerful example of how AWS is accelerating innovation across manufacturing, connected vehicles, and driver experiences,\u201d said Matt Garman, CEO at AWS. \u201cWorking with HERE, we will help automakers pioneer new ways to improve the driving experience by leveraging the global scale, reliability, and AI capabilities of AWS to power AI-driven mapping applications and features.\u201d\n\nEnabling developers to build essential location-based services\n\nHERE\u2019s mapping data and services are also used as the primary location data provider within Amazon Location Service, which enables developers to add geospatial data and location functionality to applications, including dynamic and static maps, places search and geocodes, route planning, and device tracking and geofencing capabilities. These capabilities allow customers to visualize data on a map, recommend routes, use geocoding to convert plain text addresses into geographic coordinates, convert latitude and longitude coordinates into addresses, and monitor and track assets such as fleets of vehicles.\n\nDeveloping transportation and logistics solutions\n\nBeyond the automotive industry, AWS and HERE entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (SCA) to build and scale HERE\u2019s new transportation and logistics solutions, using HERE mapping content, location services, analytics and proprietary AI/ML algorithms, on top of compute, storage and database capabilities from AWS. These new solutions will be available through AWS Marketplace and enterprise and independent software vendor (ISV) customers optimize their fulfillment and deliveries, build more efficient supply chains with increased visibility into shipments and assets, and further their sustainability goals. For example, companies are using HERE\u2019s location intelligence on AWS to gain real-time visibility into the shipment of critical equipment to provide accurate estimated times of arrival (ETAs) and ensure the timely delivery of essential products.\n\nAbout HERE\n\nHERE has been a pioneer in mapping and location technology for 40 years. Today, the HERE location platform is recognized as the most complete in the industry, powering location-based products, services and custom maps for organizations and enterprises across the globe.

They are undergoing transformation driven by solar heating and they provide a unique opportunity to learn about the surface and subsurface layers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is unique about Chiron is that we can observe both the surface, where most of the ices can be found, and the coma, where we see gases that are originating from the surface or just below it,\u201d the scientist highlighted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to follow up with Chiron,\n\n\u201cIt will come closer to us, and if we can study it at nearer distances and get better reads on the quantities and nature of the ices, silicates, and organics, we will be able to better understand how seasonal insolation variations and different illumination patterns can affect its behavior and its ice reservoir.\u201d"

It was one of the last refuges of the Anakim (literally, \u2018giants\u2019) in front of the conquering Israelites under Joshua (Joshua 11:22). Gath, a Philistine city, was either subdued during the days of the prophet Samuel, or by King David. The first book of Kings (2:39) states that in the time of King Solomon it was still ruled by a Philistine king named Achish (1 Samuel 27:1\u20137). The narrative in the first book of Chronicles (1 Chronicles 7:21) relates that Ezer and Elead, sons of Ephraim, were killed by men who were natives of Gath, because \u201cthey came down to take their livestock\u201d. In Hebrew, Kiryat Gat means \u201cthe place of the winepress\u201d.\n\nThe Israel Land Authority views this discovery as symbolic of the connection between past and future.\n\nDirector Yaacov Kvint commented: \"[the authority] invests tens of millions of shekels annually in salvage excavations for various projects across the country, aimed at uncovering and documenting the rich history and archaeology beneath the neighbourhoods of the future.\u201d\n\nThe mosaic floor will be relocated to an open area in the city and made accessible to the public.\n\n8 Included in these ten buildings is a monastery, which makes up a site which is thought to have functioned for 600 years Credit: Reuters\n\n8 A winepress was also discovered during the excavation Credit: Alamy"

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This is Part 2 of a two-part series about UFOs/UAPs and the connection between past sightings in the Minot area and the recent sightings of mysterious drones across the country.\n\nDrones have been swarming military facilities and around U.S. ships for a year or two and in all cases they were never shot down, Steve Bassett, a UFO lobbyist and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, told The Minot Daily News in a Dec. 26, 2024, interview.\n\nBecause of all the recent sightings of mysterious drones in the U.S. and also in the United Kingdom, Bassett said, \u201cPeople are filming them with their cameras and these films are turning up online. The government is getting hard questions and the best that the U.S. government has been able to do in several interviews with the press is that it\u2019s not ours, it\u2019s not a foreign adversary or another nation and we don\u2019t know what it is.\n\n\u201cNow this is ridiculous,\u201d Bassett said. He said any swarms of objects like that around U.S. warships would be shot down and every effort would be made to bring them down if any of these objects were over military bases.\n\n\u201cBut it would be a huge, huge national security matter. We know that they\u2019re not shooting them down; they\u2019re not capturing them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said people are seeing what obviously are drones.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a huge amount of other stuff up there which are not drones,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only conclusion that makes sense is that this is a UFO (unidentified flying object) flap. There have been a number of these (flaps) over the last 70 years. There\u2019s a lot of sightings, a lot of stuff in the area even nationally and then it goes away,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the biggest one ever. It\u2019s been going on for at least two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI believe what is going on is that the nonhumans \u2013 or whatever you want to call them. I call them extraterrestrials \u2013 are putting on a helluva display. They are swarming around sensitive facilities and the reason they are doing that is not to attack those facilities but to get the maximum attention. They are doing this for a reason and the government is helpless. There\u2019s nothing it can do about it.\u201d\n\nBassett maintains the government knows that they\u2019re nonhuman.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely know that these are not human craft, human-made craft, whatever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what do you do? They can\u2019t ignore it. They have to answer the questions and the best they\u2019ve been able to do is they\u2019re not ours, they\u2019re not another counties, they\u2019re not a threat and they\u2019re not shooting them down,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he believes the military is launching its own drones up into these events so people do see drones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re masking the nonhuman part of this by at least adding the human part so people will see that and then they can just call it a drone swarm and not have to face the ultimate question is what are those things up there that aren\u2019t drones?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing that explains what is happening within the standard logic that one can imply and the government is in an impossible position and if the nonhuman craft up there continue and continue to do this activity, the government is going to have to finally acknowledge that we are not alone. That\u2019s what I think is going on,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nNuclear weapons shutdown witnesses\n\nHe went on, \u201cNow the reason I think this is interesting for Minot is that, of course, this has made it much easier to get the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses and other related witnesses to the attention of Congress.\u201d\n\nBassett said it\u2019s very likely the next hearing will include the nuclear weapons shutdown witnesses. He said the witnesses to nuclear ICBM shutdown events have been trying to get in front of a hearing in Congress for many years but have been ignored.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to bring those cases really back into the world and people will learn about what happened 60 years ago,\u201d Bassett said.\n\nHe said some of the witnesses have been reluctant to speak about the incidents because it wasn\u2019t a good situation.\n\n\u201cBut the situation is obviously changing so I think that we may see several more be willing to come forward once we have the formal hearing process,\u201d he said.\n\nBassett said he has said in hundreds of interviews that the shutdown of ICBMs by these entities is the single most important thing known about them.\n\n\u201cThis is a big, big deal,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe were hoping that mock hearing in 2013 would help lead to real hearings\u201d He said it provided some help but it took several more years before a hearing finally took place.\n\nWhen another congressional hearing is held, David Schindele, a former Minot Air Force Base missile officer who was involved in a UFO incident that occurred in the Minot missile field in 1966, said he would \u201cdefinitely testify before Congress when I\u2019m called to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Trump, there\u2019s a very good possibility that he\u2019s going to seize this, based upon what I\u2019ve been reading in the news and other statements. He may jump on this early. We could see this break in the first 30 to 60 days of the Trump administration. We could have hearings that may come forward or he may just come forward on his own because he\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Bassett said.\n\n\u201cSo this embargo on the truth of this matter may be about to end in the next couple months and it can\u2019t happen too soon,\u201d Bassett said."

            "article_content": "(MENAFN- Jordan Times) LONDON - A is the overthrow of existing arrangements. A successful uprising builds new and better ones. There have been many revolutions in Latin America, but few have succeeded. Can Chile buck that age-old trend?\n\nIf zeal to throw out the old and bring in the new is the standard, then Chile's election of a constitutional earlier this month was revolutionary. In selecting the 155-member body that will write a new - the result of a political deal to end the unrest and rioting that shook the country in 2019 - Chileans gave their current political establishment an embarrassingly diminished role.\n\nThe ruling conservative coalition behind President Sebastian Pinera had expected to win one-third of the seats, which would have enabled it to block sweeping constitutional changes. But it secured barely one-quarter. The center-left parties that have governed Chile for 24 of the last 30 years fared even worse and will control just one seat in six - fewer than a new alliance of the Communist Party and other far-left parties, and fewer than the People's List, a motley assemblage of radical groups that grew out of the 2019 protests. Independent candidates - environmentalists, feminists, local leaders and advocates of devolution to Chile's regions - were the overwhelming winners.\n\nThe results mark a clear shift to the left, but the international media's preferred narrative - that this was an electoral revolt against Chile's so-called neoliberal economic model - is too simplistic. Among those failing to get a seat in the convention were the Communist Party member who runs Chile's largest labor confederation, the former head of the national teachers' union, and the leader of the hugely popular movement pushing to abolish the country's privatised pension system. All three embody opposition to anything that smacks of market-based economics.\n\nThe election was about left versus right. But it was even more about young versus old, novel versus outdated, and autonomous versus institutional. Voters rejected not only the political and business elites, but also every other elite - academic, NGO, union and media.\n\nThe good news is that the convention looks like the country. Half of its members are women. Indigenous peoples hold a sizeable block of seats. Predictably, there are many lawyers. But the body also includes schoolteachers, shop owners, veterinarians, dentists, a car mechanic, a deep-water diver, a professional chess player - and only one economist. Chile's traditional political class, chock-a-block with the private school-educated offspring of politicians, does not look like that. If Chile's political institutions had been suffering from a legitimacy deficit, a new constitution written by such a body should go a long way to plug that gap.\n\nThe bad news is that the 155 convention members must cast aside everything they stand for in order to do their job well. A generation reared on direct participatory politics - whether via Twitter, on university campuses, or in the streets - now must build a representative democracy. United in their distrust of political parties, they need to craft rules that allow parties to thrive. Tipsy with the elixir of absolute moral certitude, they now must create institutions where negotiation and compromise can take place.\n\nAt stake in the convention is nothing less than the nature of democracy. Latin Americans have been trying their hands at it for two centuries now, but have chalked up more failures than successes. Chile's is the oldest and among the most stable in the region, but even there, decades of tranquility have been punctuated by civil wars, spasms of violence, and General Augusto Pinochet's ferocious 17-year dictatorship. Moreover, many Chileans think that the democracy rebuilt in the three decades since the dictator was voted out of office is overcentralised and unresponsive to citizens' demands.\n\nThe constitutional convention is a chance to right those wrongs. But building a better political system requires understanding the shortcomings of the old one.\n\nIn the presidential regimes common across Latin America, chief executives are elected directly by voters, serve a fixed term of office, and can influence the legislative agenda. Thus, on paper they have strong powers. Hence the talk, common in Chile and elsewhere, of ending\u201chyper-presidentialism\u201d. But practice is very different from theory. Proportional electoral systems produce fragmented parliaments in which presidents seldom command a majority. Lame ducks from day one, they are unable to pass laws or deliver on their promises.\n\nFurthermore, parties themselves are weak. Members of parliament are chosen under an\u201copen list\u201d system that prevents party bosses from rewarding loyal party members by placing them at the top of a\u201cclosed list\u201d - common in European democracies - where they have a high probability of being elected. And candidate primaries, while supposedly great for accountability and internal party democracy, are terrible for party cohesion. A media-savvy outsider with exotic ideas or no ideas at all (think Donald Trump) can easily upstage the hard-working activist who has spent a quarter-century helping to build the party up from the grassroots.\n\nProgressive politicians from the old parties and the independents and radicals who are now trying to displace them have one thing in common. Ask them why they are in politics, and they will all say they are proud to participate in a collective endeavour to defend the public interest - implicitly contrasting this calling with the individualism that markets presumably foster.\n\nIn fact, the opposite is true. Chilean parliamentarians are often described, tongue firmly in cheek, as single-owner business enterprises, forever switching allegiances and flip-flopping on policies when it profits them politically - whether by a lift in the polls or 15 minutes of social-media fame. New parties and movements break into splinter groups and factions the day after they are born. Anti-capitalists (but not only them) have brought into politics some of the worst habits of the capitalist culture they deplore.\n\nIf Chile's constitutional revolution is to succeed and show the way forward for Latin America's other democracies, all of that must change. The adolescent dream of direct democracy must give way to the lackluster adult reality of representative democracy. Independents must be willing to build institutions that enable parties to wield real power and give rise to governments that are strong enough to govern. Talk of collaborative endeavors must translate into the kind of public-spirited politics that focuses on the next generation, not just the next election. Can it happen? Perhaps. But don't hold your breath.\n\nAndre\u0301s Velasco, a former presidential candidate and finance minister of Chile, is Dean of the School of Public Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
