Many Americans simply don\u2019t like a mundane answer \u2014 fixed-wing piloted aircraft, smaller planes, hobbyist drones \u2014 that implies they are rubes at best and paranoid at worst.\n\nEven assurances from New Jersey officials in particular have done little to quiet the current public clamor. Perhaps that\u2019s unsurprising for a state where, like so many other parts of the country, people were duped by Orson Welles\u2019 radio play \u201cWar of the Worlds\u201d 86 years ago this fall. Perhaps that\u2019s a cheap shot at the Garden State on my part: A YouGov poll this year found that some 18 percent of Americans nationwide report having seen a U.F.O.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. issued a joint statement last week assuring the public that they \u201ctake seriously the threat that can be posed by unmanned aircraft systems.\u201d And this week the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned drones from flying over nearly two dozen communities in the state.\n\nIn some cases, people in New Jersey have been sending their own commercially available drones aloft to investigate reports of \u2026 all the flying drones. I suspect what\u2019s going on in some of the cases is that people are seeing real drones aloft for the first time. Not only that: The government did not allow drones to be flown at night until late last year. No doubt the public\u2019s unfamiliarity will decrease as these devices become more and more widespread and visible in all of our daily lives."

            "article_content": "Area 51's 'literally out of this world' UFO secrets might finally come to light sometime next year.\n\nJim Goodall, an aviation journalist with firsthand sources who have worked at the classified base, gave an interview in the mid-1990s where he discussed top-secret technologies at the site that 'would make George Lucas envious.'\n\n'One gentleman spent 12 of his 30 years in black programs at Groom Lake [as Area 51 is also known],' Goodall explained in the unearthed documentary interview.\n\n'I asked him, 'Can you really tell me what's happening out there?'' he continued.\n\n'And he said, 'Well, there's a lot of things going on there that I won't be able to tell you until the year 2025.''\n\nThe mention of '2025' could refer to an executive order by then-President Bill Clinton, which established a 25-year timer for the 'automatic declassification' of government secrets.\n\nThis means many top-secret projects from the 1990s could soon be declassified.\n\nArea 51 is just one of many sensitive military facilities located within the US Air Force's Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), a sprawling military training area in Nevada's Mojave Desert.\n\nThe shroud of secrecy surrounding Area 51 has fueled widespread conspiracy theories about its true purpose, including claims that it houses captured or crashed UFOs.\n\nAbove, a satellite view of Area 51. The United States Air Force facility is a remote detachment of Edwards Air Force Base, within the Nevada Test and Training Range\n\nUFO enthusiasts are pouring over comments Goodall (pictured) made in the mid-'90s, quoting his anonymous sources. One Area 51 source told him, 'I won't be able to tell you until the year 2025. But we have things in the Nevada desert that would make George Lucas envious'\n\nIn the resurfaced interview, Goodall recounted a conversation with a 'safety specialist' and US Air Force chief master sergeant who worked at the Nevada test site.\n\nThe specialist reportedly told him: 'We have things out there that are literally out of this world\u2026 better than Star Trek.' or anything you can see in the movies.'\n\nWhen Goodall asked his anonymous source, 'Do you believe in UFOs?' the answer was unequivocal.\n\n'He looked at me with a straight face, one-on-one, and said, 'Absolutely. Positively. They do exist,'' Goodall recalled in the documentary.\n\n'I said, 'Can you expand upon that?' And he replied, 'No, I can't.''\n\nFrom his vantage point spying on Area 51 in the Nevada desert, Goodall caught glimpses and heard firsthand accounts of exotic craft that defied conventional understanding.\n\n'There is a stealth or low-observable electronic warfare aircraft. It's been referred to as 'Excalibur,'' he said in the interview.\n\n'There's an aircraft designed to fly very, very high, but also very, very slow and incredibly quiet,' he add.\n\nA rendering of the metallic egg-shaped UFO is seen. 'X-rays couldn't penetrate it; it showed up on X-ray as a solid object. They tried to open it and penetrate its hull; they couldn't,' Taber said\n\nGoodall also discussed how witnesses near the Skunk Works facility reported seeing three triangle-shaped craft that made 'no noise,' even when flying at relatively low altitudes.\n\nHe then shared reports of an aircraft tracked by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) out of the San Francisco Bay Area TRACON (Traffic Control) in Oakland, California.\n\nThis craft, spotted at least eight times since 1986, reportedly flew through controlled airspace at speeds exceeding 10,000 miles per hour.\n\n'And it's a very, very large aircraft at that,' he added.\n\nGoodall's accounts align with claims made on the record by Ben Rich, the late director of Lockheed Martin's classified Skunk Works division.\n\n'Ben Rich told me twice before he died,' Goodall recounted, ''We have things at Area 51 that you and the best minds in the world won't even be able to conceive of for another 30 or 40 years\u2014and they won't be made public for another 50.''\n\nRich died on January 5, 1995.\n\nBut Goodall today noted that Area 51 has become much more difficult to penetrate than during his 1990s heyday \u2014 which might indicate it will hold on to its secrets well beyond 2025, matching a timeline closer to Rich's 50-year window.\n\n'That veil is pretty thick today,' Goodall told Las Vegas TV news reporter George Knapp in 2019. 'The security around Area 51 is thicker than we've ever seen.'\n\nIn 2021, private pilot and amateur photographer Gabe Zeifman nabbed this image of a triangle craft while flying his own plane past the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR), past Papoose Dry Lake, and past Groom Lake which is home to Area 51\n\nAbove: a collection of once 'top secret' aircraft made by Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works for the US military over the years\n\nLast year, defense aerospace contractor Eric Taber told to DailyMail.com that a close relative who worked as an Area 51 contractor, Sam Urquhart, had revealed that he had worked on strange 'egg-shaped' spacecraft at the mysterious desert base.\n\nThis egg-shaped metallic UFO was kept at Area 51 in the 1980s, after the CIA found the strange craft in the desert, according to Taber.\n\n'It was egg-shaped, about the size of an SUV, smooth and seamless, metallic-looking, silverish gray in color, with no control surfaces, no flaps, no inlet, and no exhaust, and no writing or symbols on the outside,' Taber was told by his late great uncle Urquhart.\n\nOther claims of alien craft housed at Area 51 have included the so-called 'Fluxliner' or Alien Reproduction Vehicle (ARV), a man-made reverse-engineered alien spacecraft uncovered by an aerospace industry illustrator in 1988.\n\nIn 2021, Gabriel Zeifman captured an image of a triangular craft that might have been a UFO or might have been a man-made craft capable of hypersonic flight.\n\nThe craft was parked just a 120-feet wide by 320-feet long shelter at Area 51 that has been identified in the past as Hangar 19.\n\nDefense industry watchers at The War Zone speculated that the triangle might have been an actual known hypersonic aircraft, called the Martin Marietta X-24B.\n\n'Although its odd shape is intriguing,' the site noted, 'most things that fly out of Groom under a secretive test regime look alien, at least historically speaking.'"

            "article_content": "In a previous post, we covered Microsoft\u2019s plans to rebrand the Microsoft 365 app to Microsoft 365 Copilot. It\u2019s obvious that Copilot will take center stage in the upcoming version, and a recent Microsoft 365 roadmap seen by Windows Latest gives a brief idea of what\u2019s coming.\n\nFirstly, the Copilot page will automatically launch when clicking the Copilot keyboard key in the Microsoft 365 app. The next big change is retiring the top header to give a more clean look to the UI. It is a big change because the right part of the bar contains profile and account-related options.\n\nAll these options will now migrate to the bottom of the left-side menu. So, you\u2019ll need to expand the Settings and more section to access profile, feedback, and app settings.\n\nMicrosoft is also retiring the organization name header, which appeared in the top header. A valid reason for removing this is that Copilot is a tool to get the job done but not a crucial app like Word or Excel, which the organization uses most of the time.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019ll move the AI features like Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat and Copilot Pages to the left sidebar in hopes of drawing more eyeballs than usual. To make space for Copilot, it\u2019s removing the My Day and Help me Create buttons, which have no need since Copilot is a polished version for queries, summarization, and generation tasks.\n\nYou\u2019ll also not see the Back button because Microsoft believes the tabbed interface is enough to switch between multiple apps or app pages.\n\nAlso, what about the search bar? It\u2019s now set to appear on the homepage so you can look for content across different sections, but there are no other changes to the search bar. Only the position is changing.\n\nAll these app changes apply to both the web and desktop versions of the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. You can expect these changes to be reflected in the service from the third week of January 2025.\n\nBut are these changes helpful for the end user?\n\nCopilot is omnipresent\n\nRebranding an already confusing name like Microsoft 365 to Microsoft 365 Copilot makes little sense. With all the hype this AI assistant has received for the last year or so, rarely users or organizations don\u2019t know about it.\n\nEven worse is renaming the simple Copilot service to Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat for enterprise users. That\u2019s a too-long name and based on the little help that it offers, it\u2019ll find very less adoption in the enterprise scenario. The URLs have also changed to reflect the name change, so users don\u2019t get confused.\n\nWe hope that Microsoft sticks to the Copilot name until the service is discontinued (less likely as AI is omnipresent now)."

            "article_content": "OpenAI has done something that some people thought would be impossible. The company created an AI-powered search engine called ChatGPT Search, which has been in beta tests for a while now. OpenAI made ChatGPT Search available to all ChatGPT users a few days ago. Until then, only premium users had access to it. ChatGPT Search isn\u2019t quite a Google Search killer, but I\u2019ve started to appreciate it more and more as I use ChatGPT.\n\nAs surprising as it might sound, ChatGPT Search is exactly the kind of product a newcomer to the AI online search business can afford to release. Meanwhile, Google, the most likely company to bring AI to online search, doesn\u2019t have the same freedom.\n\nRemember how Bard fumbled its initial demos, causing Google stock to crash? Also, think of the \u201cglue on pizza\u201d AI Overview fumbles that Google had to fix. These are examples that prove Google can\u2019t just add AI to Google Search and hope for the best.\n\nGoogle Search must provide correct information and be at least as reliable as its hundreds of millions of users expect it to be. AI hallucinations can be a big problem in that regard. At the same time, Google needs to offer users an AI online search tool like ChatGPT Search. Failure to do it wouldn\u2019t look good either.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nThat\u2019s probably where Google\u2019s new AI Mode will come in handy.\n\nAccording to The Information, the AI Mode will be an option in Google Search. That\u2019s a great way to tackle AI for the masses. After all, not everyone out there wants to use ChatGPT or Gemini. Some people will prefer simple searches over chats with an AI bot.\n\nThe AI Mode option will reportedly sit at the top of the results page, on the left side of the current menu items like \u201cAll,\u201d \u201cImages,\u201d \u201cVideos,\u201d and \u201cShopping.\u201d That\u2019s a clear indication of how important AI is for Google, but also a hint that it will be an optional way to find information online. No one seemed to appreciate having AI Overviews shoved down their throats, after all.\n\nTap the AI Mode tab, and you will reportedly get an interface similar to Gemini AI. That also makes sense, considering that ChatGPT Search is actually built into the ChatGPT interface. In fact, ChatGPT Search made OpenAI improve the way ChatGPT works, as the app now displays sources for its searches more prominently than ever.\n\nPress the Sources button in ChatGPT Search, and you get a new menu with links on the right side. Image source: Chris Smith, BGR\n\nWhen talking to Gemini in AI Mode, you\u2019ll get links to relevant pages, which is to be expected from any Google Search product. The AI Mode will also include conversational answers and a search bar to ask follow-up questions. Put differently, the Google Search experience will feel much more like ChatGPT Search once you start using it.\n\nI will also mention Google\u2019s advantage over this approach. If necessary, you can always switch back to the regular non-AI search results.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how AI Overviews and the AI Mode will work. Hopefully, the latter will replace the former, but that\u2019s just me speculating. Then again, I\u2019m more likely to use ChatGPT Search to search the web than Google Search. Even without ChatGPT Search, I\u2019d still use alternative search engines for my needs.\n\nWhen is the AI Mode coming? We have no idea, but it has to happen soon, considering that OpenAI just made ChatGPT Search available to the world.\n\nGoogle has been working on the feature for quite a while. As The Verge reports, 9to5Google found evidence of the AI Mode in a beta version of the Search app on Android.\n\nA few days after that, Android Authority performed its own teardown of the Google Search for Android app, finding the UI for AI Mode. The shortcut worked as described in The Information\u2019s report but was not fully functional. You can check out screenshots at this link.\n\nSince Google is clearly looking to bring AI Mode to Android and iPhone, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it all works for the mobile Gemini experience. With ChatGPT Search, you get everything inside the larger ChatGPT app, so your other chats with the AI are just one in-app search away. But AI Mode might be separate from your regular Gemini chats."

            "article_content": "Louise Stokes said there was paranormal acitvity in her council house and that objects flew out of a cupboard while she made food for her children. Photograph: iStock\n\nA woman has told the High Court she fears for the safety of her five young children due to \u201cparanormal activity\u201d that has caused tables and chairs to move at her newly provided council home.\n\nLouise and Thomas Stokes took a High Court case alleging they could not stay at their previous home in Mount Temple, Carrick-on-Shannon, Co Leitrim because of concerns for their children\u2019s health arising from a mould problem. The case was struck out on Friday.\n\nHowever, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Garrett Simons that a new property the family has been moved into by Leitrim County Council has caused her to be fearful for her children due to \u201cparanormal activity\u201d.\n\nThe family\u2019s original complaint to the High Court was that the local authority did not classify them as homeless even though it was alleged that mould in the first property was so bad had led to hospital visits and forced the entire family to sleep downstairs rather than in their bedrooms.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe claim against the council alleged that works were carried out to alleviate the situation by improving ventilation and removing the mould but the problem returned. Those works were insufficient, the family claimed, in arguing that the property was not fit for human habitation and emergency accommodation was needed.\n\nThe family alleged that in the five-year period they lived in the property, the problem with mould became so bad that they were forced to leave and live temporarily with relatives before returning. The court heard that the council placed the family on a transfer list and they accepted the offer of a new property in October.\n\nHowever, Ms Stokes told Mr Justice Simons that since she has moved there \u201cnumerous objects\u201d in the new house have been \u201cflown from side to side\u201d, while doors and a table and chairs \u201cwere moving in front of our eyes\u201d. She said that while making food for her children, objects flew out of the cupboard she opened.\n\nMs Stokes said she contacted the previous occupant of the house, who wrote them a letter which the applicant described as \u201cbeyond traumatic\u201d. Ms Stokes claims she brought the letter to the attention of the council but was \u201claughed at\u201d during a meeting.\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves a home. I never asked for a mansion, I asked for a safe home for my kids. I just want somewhere safe for my kids five days before Christmas,\u201d she said.\n\nMr Justice Simons struck out the family\u2019s claim against the council, which he said only related to the first property. He said the only case before him was in relation to the first house and that \u201cthe case has come and gone, as it were\u201d due to the family\u2019s move.\n\nHe told Ms Stokes he understood her concern about the second house experiencing \u201cparanormal activity\u201d and her fears for the safety of her children, but that a third house would mean a new application to the local authority."

            "article_content": "OpenAI today announced an improved version of its most capable artificial intelligence model to date\u2014one that takes even more time to deliberate over questions\u2014just a day after Google announced its first model of this type.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s new model, called o3, replaces o1, which the company introduced in September. Like o1, the new model spends time ruminating over a problem in order to deliver better answers to questions that require step-by-step logical reasoning. (OpenAI chose to skip the \u201co2\u201d moniker because it's already the name of a mobile carrier in the UK.)\n\n\u201cWe view this as the beginning of the next phase of AI,\u201d said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on a livestream Friday. \u201cWhere you can use these models to do increasingly complex tasks that require a lot of reasoning.\u201d\n\nThe o3 model scores much higher on several measures than its predecessor, OpenAI says, including ones that measure complex coding-related skills and advanced math and science competency. It is three times better than o1 at answering questions posed by ARC-AGI, a benchmark designed to test an AI models\u2019 ability to reason over extremely difficult mathematical and logic problems they\u2019re encountering for the first time.\n\nGoogle is pursuing a similar line of research. Noam Shazeer, a Google researcher, yesterday revealed in a post on X that the company has developed its own reasoning model, called Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. Google\u2019s CEO, Sundar Pichai, called it \u201cour most thoughtful model yet\u201d in his own post. Google\u2019s new model achieved a high score on SWE-Bench, a test that measures a models\u2019 agentic abilities.\n\nHowever, OpenAI\u2019s new o3 model is 20 percent better than o1. \u201co3 blew it out of the water,\u201d says Ofir Press, a post-doctoral researcher at Princeton University who helped develop SWE-Bench. \u201cVery surprising increase, not sure how they did it.\u201d\n\nThe two dueling models show competition between OpenAI and Google to be fiercer than ever. It is crucial for OpenAI to demonstrate that it can keep making advances as it seeks to attract more investment and build a profitable business. Google is meanwhile desperate to show that it remains at the forefront of AI research.\n\nThe new models also show how AI companies are increasingly looking beyond simply scaling up AI models in order to wring greater intelligence out of them."

            "article_content": "OpenAI's o1 model was hailed as a breakthrough in September.\n\nBy November, a Chinese AI lab had released a similar model called DeepSeek.\n\nOn Thursday, Google came out with a challenger called Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.\n\nIn September, OpenAI unveiled a radically new type of AI model called o1. In a matter of months, rivals introduced similar offerings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, Google released Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, which uses reasoning techniques that look a lot like o1.\n\nEven before that, in November, a Chinese company announced DeepSeek, an AI model that breaks challenging questions down into more manageable tasks like OpenAI's o1 does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is the latest example of a crowded AI frontier where pricey innovations are swiftly matched, making it harder to stand out.\n\n\"It's amazing how quickly AI model improvements get commoditized,\" Rahul Sonwalkar, CEO of the startup Julius AI, said. \"Companies spend massive amounts building these new models, and within a few months they become a commodity.\"\n\nThe proliferation of multiple AI models with similar capabilities could make it difficult to justify charging high prices to use these tools. The price of accessing AI models has indeed plunged in the past year or so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat, in turn, could raise questions about whether it's worth spending hundreds of millions of dollars, or even billions, to build the next top AI model.\n\nSeptember is a lifetime ago in the AI industry\n\nWhen OpenAI previewed its o1 model in September, the product was hailed as a breakthrough. It uses a new approach called inference-time compute to answer more challenging questions.\n\nIt does this by slicing queries into more digestible tasks and turning each of these stages into a new prompt that the model tackles. Each step requires running a new request, which is known as the inference stage in AI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis produces a chain of thought or chain of reasoning in which each part of the problem is answered, and the model doesn't move on to the next stage until it ultimately comes up with a full response.\n\nThe model can even backtrack and check its prior steps and correct errors, or try solutions and fail before trying something else. This is akin to how humans spend longer working through complex tasks.\n\nRelated stories\n\nDeepSeek rises\n\nIn a mere two months, o1 had a rival. On November 20, a Chinese AI company released DeepSeek.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They were probably the first ones to reproduce o1,\" said Charlie Snell, an AI researcher at UC Berkeley who coauthored a Google DeepMind paper this year on inference-time compute.\n\nHe's tried DeepSeek's AI model and says it performs well on complex math problems that must be solved by thinking for longer and in stages.\n\nHe noted that in DeepSeek's DeepThink mode, the model shows users every step of its thought process. With o1, these intermediate steps are hidden from users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I've asked people at OpenAI what they think of it,\" Snell told BI. \"They say it looks like the same thing, but they don't how DeepSeek did this so fast.\"\n\nOpenAI didn't respond to a request for comment. On Friday, the startup previewed an o1 successor, called o3. Francois Chollet, a respected AI expert, called the update a \"significant breakthrough.\"\n\nAndrej Karpathy, an OpenAI cofounder, praised Google's new \"Thinking\" model for the same reasoning feature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The prominent and pleasant surprise here is that unlike o1 the reasoning traces of the model are shown,\" he wrote on X. \"As a user I personally really like this because the reasoning itself is interesting to see and read \u2014 the models actively think through different possibilities, ideas, debate themselves, etc., it's part of the value add.\"\n\nA DeepSeek demo\n\nSnell shared a multistep math problem with Business Insider, which we used to test DeepSeek for ourselves:\n\n\"Find a sequence of +, -, /, * which can be applied to the numbers 7, 3, 11, 5 to get to 24, where each of the given numbers is used exactly once.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBI put that prompt in DeepSeek's chat window on its website. The model responded initially by laying out the challenge ahead.\n\n\"Alright, so I've got this problem here: I need to use the numbers 7, 3, 11, and 5, and combine them with the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, using each number exactly once, to get to 24,\" it replied. \"At first glance, this seems a bit tricky, but I think with some systematic thinking, I can figure it out.\"\n\nIt then proceeded through multiple steps over roughly 16 pages of discussion that included mathematical calculations and equations. The model sometimes got it wrong, but it spotted this and didn't give up. Instead, it swiftly moved on to another possible solution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Almost got close there with 33 / 7 * 5 \u2248 23.57, but not quite 24. Maybe I need to try a different approach,\" it wrote at one point.\n\nAfter a few minutes, it found the correct solution.\n\n\"You can see it try different ideas and backtrack,\" Snell said in an interview on Wednesday. He highlighted this part of DeepSeek's chain of thought as particularly noteworthy:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"This is getting really time-consuming. Maybe I need to consider a different strategy,\" the AI model wrote. \"Instead of combining two numbers at a time, perhaps I should look for a way to group them differently or use operations in a nested manner.\"\n\nThen Google appears\n\nSnell said other companies are likely working on AI models that use the same inference-time compute approach as OpenAI.\n\n\"DeepSeek does this already, so I assume others are working on this,\" he added on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following day, Google released Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking. Like DeepSeek, this new model shows users each step of its thought process while tackling problems.\n\nJeff Dean, a Google AI veteran, shared a demo on X that showed this new model solving a physics problem and explained its reasoning steps.\n\n\"This model is trained to use thoughts to strengthen its reasoning,\" Dean wrote. \"We see promising results when we increase inference time computation!\""

First, the company revealed the full-function version of its new o1 family of reasoning models and announced that they would be immediately available, albeit in limited amounts, to its $20/month Plus tier subscribers. In order to get full use of the new model (as well as every other model that OpenAI offers, plus unlimited access to Advanced Voice Mode), users will need to spring for OpenAI\u2019s newest, and highest, subscription package: the $200/month Pro tier.\n\nDay 2: OpenAI expands its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research program\n\nOn the event\u2019s second day, the OpenAI development team announced that it is expanding its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research program, which allows developers to train the company\u2019s models as subject matter experts that \u201cexcel at specific sets of complex, domain-specific tasks,\u201d according to the program\u2019s website. Though it is geared more toward institutes, universities, and enterprises than individual users, the company plans to make the program\u2019s API available to the public early next year.\n\nDay 3: OpenAI\u2019s Sora video generator has finally arrived. Huzzah?\n\nSora\u201312 Days of OpenAI: Day 3\n\nOn the third day of OpenAI, Sam Altman gave to me: Sora video generation. Yeah, OK, so the cadence for that doesn\u2019t quite work but hey, neither does Sora. OpenAI\u2019s long-awaited and highly touted video generation model, which has been heavily hyped since February, made its official debut on December 9 to middling reviews. Turns out that two years into the AI boom, being the leading company in the space and only rolling out 20-second clips at 1080p doesn\u2019t really move the needle, especially when many of its competitors already offer similar performance without requiring a $20- or $200-per-month subscription.\n\nDay 4: OpenAI expands its Canvas\n\nOpenAI followed up its Sora revelations with a set of improvements to its recently released Canvas feature, the company\u2019s answer to Anthropic\u2019s Artifacts. During its Day 4 live stream, the OpenAI development team revealed that Canvas will now be integrated directly into the GPT-4o model, making it natively available to users at all price tiers, including free. You can now run Python code directly within the Canvas space, enabling the chatbot to analyze it directly and offer suggestions for improvement, as well as use the feature to construct custom GPTs.\n\nDay 5: ChatGPT teams up with Apple Intelligence\n\nOn day five, OpenAI announced that it is working with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into Apple Intelligence, specifically Siri, allowing users to invoke the chatbot directly through iOS. Apple had announced that this would be a thing back when it first unveiled Apple Intelligence but, with the release of iOS 18.2, that functionality is now a reality. If only Apple\u2019s users actually wanted to use Apple\u2019s AI.\n\nDay 6: Advanced Voice Mode now has the power of sight and can speak Santa\n\n2024 was the year that Advanced Voice Mode got its eyes. OpenAI announced on Day 6 of its live-stream event that its conversational chatbot model can now view the world around it through a mobile device\u2019s video camera or via screen sharing. This will enable users to ask the AI questions about their surroundings without having to describe the scene or upload a photo of what they\u2019re looking at. The company also released a seasonal voice for AVM which mimics Jolly Old St. Nick, just in case you don\u2019t have time to drive your kids to the mall and meet the real one in person.\n\nDay 7: OpenAI introduces Projects for ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI closed out the first week of announcements with one that is sure to bring a smile to the face of every boy and girl: folders! Specifically, the company revealed its new smart folder system, dubbed \u201cProjects,\u201d which allows users to better organize their chat histories and uploaded documents by subject.\n\nDay 8: ChatGPT Search is now available to everybody\n\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Search function, which debuted in October, is now available to all logged-in users, regardless of their subscription tier. The feature works by searching the internet for information about the user\u2019s query, scraping the info it finds from relevant websites, and then synthesize that data into a conversational answer. It essentially eliminates the need to click through a search results page and is functionally identical to what Perplexity AI offers, allowing ChatGPT to compete with the increasingly popular app. Be warned, however: a recent study has shown the feature to be \u201cconfidently wrong\u201d in many of its answers.\n\nDay 9: the full o1 model comes to OpenAI\u2019s API\n\nLike being gifted a sweater from not one but two aunts, OpenAI revealed on day nine that it is allowing select developers to access the full version of its o1 reasoning model through the API. The company is also rolling out real-time API updates, a new model customization technique called Preference Fine-Tuning, and new SDKs for Go and Java.\n\nDay 10: 1-800-ChatGPT\n\nIn an effort to capture that final market segment that it couldn\u2019t already reach \u2014 specifically, people without internet access \u2014 OpenAI has released the 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478) chatline. Dial in from any land or mobile number within the U.S. to speak with the AI\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode for up to 15 minutes for free.\n\nDay 11: ChatGPT now works with even more coding apps\n\nLast month, OpenAI granted the Mac-based desktop version of ChatGPT the ability to interface directly with a number of popular coding applications, allowing its AI to pull snippets directly from them rather than require users to copy and paste the code into its chatbot\u2019s prompt window. On Thursday, the company announced that it is drastically expanding the number of apps and IDEs that ChatGPT can collaborate with. And it\u2019s not just coding apps; ChatGPT now also works with conventional text programs like Apple Notes, Notion, and Quip. You can even launch Advanced Voice Mode in a separate window as you work, asking questions and getting suggestions from the AI about your current project.\n\nDay 12: OpenAI teases its upcoming o3 and o3-mini reasoning models\n\nOpenAI o3 and o3-mini\u201412 Days of OpenAI: Day 12\n\nFor the 12th day of OpenAI\u2019s live-stream event, CEO Sam Altman made a final appearance to discuss what the company has in store for the new year \u2014 specifically, its next-generation reasoning models, o3 and o3-mini. The naming scheme is a bit odd (and done to avoid copyright issues with U.K. telecom, O2) but the upcoming models reportedly offer superior performance on some of the industry\u2019s most challenging math, science, and coding benchmark tests \u2014 even compared to o1, the full version of which was formally released less than a fortnight ago. The company is currently offering o3-mini as a preview to researchers for safety testing and red teaming trials, though there\u2019s no word yet on when everyday users will be able to try the models for themselves."

            "article_content": "When looking to build or renovate your home or office, looking at emerging trends can inspire a project with long-term utility and timeless style. Trends in the New Hampshire construction industry include efforts toward greener designs and increased energy efficiency, which keep the overall maintenance costs and energy use down. Our panel shares their insights into the specifics they are seeing in their work.\n\nPanelists:\n\nDylan R. Cruess, Chief Operating Officer, TF Moran Inc., tfmoran.com\n\nJeremy Baldwin, AIA and Multifamily Studio Lead, Maugel DeStefano Architects, maugel.com\n\nDylan R. Cruess, Chief Operating Officer, TF Moran Inc.\n\nWhat are the emerging trends shaping the construction industry? How can businesses align their strategies with these developments for a competitive edge?\n\nAs with many industries, technology is pushing and shaping the construction industry from the design to the actual construction. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is becoming much more common and accepted in design and construction projects. With BIM, you can create a 3D computer model of the entire project including the parking areas, utility connections and building construction, which allows owners, engineers and contractors to visualize the final development and detect any conflicts before construction. To gain a competitive edge, businesses should always be looking at how technology is affecting their industry and should aim to be ahead of their competitors in adopting new technology.\n\nAmid evolving environmental concerns, how are sustainability practices influencing construction projects, and what are the key considerations for businesses looking to adopt eco-conscious approaches?\n\nSustainability practices have long been a focus in civil engineering design and construction. In the early to mid-2000s, there was a big push for LEED Certification which was a way to demonstrate that a development went above and beyond the construction requirements for sustainability. Since the 2000s, municipal regulations and building codes have been revised to incorporate many of LEED Certification\u2019s sustainability requirements, so it is now common practice in the construction industry to minimize environmental impacts and focus on sustainability.\n\nIn the context of urbanization and infrastructure growth, what role does innovative project management play in ensuring the successful execution of complex construction endeavors, and how can businesses excel in this area?\n\nFor urbanization and infrastructure growth, project management and future development planning are absolutely critical. My firm is involved in several large mixed-use developments that require substantial expansion of existing sewer, water, stormwater and electrical systems. When considering expansion of existing infrastructure, the existing systems\u2019 total capacity and connection points need to be considered as well as what additional demands a new development will place on existing systems.\n\nWith a focus on safety and regulatory compliance, what steps should businesses take to mitigate risks and ensure the well-being of workers and stakeholders in construction projects?\n\nSafety and regulatory compliance start with a company culture that prioritizes safety. My firm tells our field personnel that they can always say \u201cno\u201d to any task in the field if they have any safety concerns. Additionally, focusing on safety equipment is paramount in promoting a safe work environment. The cost of safety equipment and gear is negligible compared to the lost time and medical expenses of a workplace injury or safety incident.\n\nJeremy Baldwin, AIA and Multifamily Studio Lead Maugel DeStefano Architects\n\nAs the construction industry looks ahead to new mechanical code changes, refrigerant requirements have become a hot topic of conversation. These regulations could significantly impact mechanical designs for future projects, and staying ahead of the curve is critical. Here\u2019s a quick look at what\u2019s driving these changes, why they matter, and how you can prepare.\n\nWhy are refrigerants being phased down?\n\nThe phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) under the 2020 AIM Act is the centerpiece of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. HFCs are commonly found in refrigerants like R-410A, and they have a high global warming potential. The goal is to reduce HFC usage by 85% by 2036, requiring a shift toward more sustainable refrigerant options such as A2L refrigerants.\n\nHow will the new regulations impact mechanical design?\n\nThis phasedown represents a significant shift in how mechanical systems are designed. While A2L refrigerants offer environmental benefits and improved efficiency, they also introduce unique challenges:\n\nR-410A is being phased out. The current refrigerant standard for HVAC systems, R-410A, will be replaced by A2L refrigerants with lower HFC\u2019s.\n\nA2L refrigerants will be the new standard. These refrigerants have lower global warming potential, greater energy efficiency, making them a more sustainable choice. However, A2L is mildly flammable (Class 2), which requires updated safety measures.\n\nNew safety requirements for HVAC designs. Refrigerant lines that penetrate more than one floor or ceiling assembly will need ventilated shafts, either natural or mechanical. Exceptions may apply for smaller systems serving single units.\n\nWhat are the new requirements?\n\nA2L refrigerants will be the standard for new HVAC, refrigeration and heat pump systems.\n\nRated shafts will be required for refrigerant lines passing through multiple floors to address flammability concerns.\n\nExisting systems using R-410A will be allowed to remain in use until January 1, 2026, but manufacturers are already phasing out the production of R-410A systems. Replacement parts and repair options for older systems will become increasingly scarce.\n\nWhy do these new changes matter?\n\nTransitioning to A2L refrigerants will help the construction industry achieve environmental goals without compromising performance. However, the shift introduces complexities in design, safety and installation that developers, engineers and contractors must navigate. Additionally, some states have already implemented requirements for mechanical ventilation and emergency backup power for these rated shafts.\n\nHow is Maugel DeStefano Architects preparing?\n\nAs architects, we are committed to guiding our clients through this transition. Our approach includes:\n\nClose collaboration with suppliers.

            "article_content": "In hardware businesses, managing inventory is a critical yet challenging task. With a wide range of products such as tools, machinery, spare parts, and construction materials, maintaining accurate stock control can quickly become overwhelming. Errors in stock tracking can lead to overstocking, stockouts, and lost revenue.\n\nHardware inventory software is designed to address these challenges by automating and streamlining inventory processes. This article explores why this software is essential for achieving precise stock control and the benefits it brings to your business.\n\nThe Challenges of Manual Inventory Management\n\nMany hardware businesses rely on manual methods, such as spreadsheets or handwritten records, to manage their stock. While these methods may seem cost-effective initially, they often result in:\n\nInaccurate Stock Records: Human error during data entry can lead to mismatches in inventory levels.\n\nTime-Consuming Processes: Counting stock manually takes significant time and resources.\n\nDifficulty in Tracking Trends: Analyzing inventory performance is cumbersome without automated tools.\n\nDelayed Reordering: Manual systems often fail to signal low-stock items in time, causing stockouts.\n\nHardware inventory software eliminates these issues by automating stock management and providing accurate, real-time data.\n\nKey Features of Hardware Inventory Software for Stock Control\n\n1. Real-Time Tracking\n\nHardware inventory software offers real-time visibility into your stock levels. Whether you operate a single location or multiple warehouses, you\u2019ll always know the exact quantity of each item.\n\n2. Automated Reordering\n\nSet minimum stock thresholds for each item, and the software automatically alerts you when it\u2019s time to reorder. This ensures that essential products are always in stock, preventing disruptions.\n\n3. Barcode and QR Code Scanning\n\nWith barcode or QR code functionality, you can quickly add, update, or locate items in your inventory. This reduces errors and speeds up stock tracking significantly.\n\n4. Categorization and Organization\n\nGroup products into categories such as tools, fasteners, or electrical components. This organization makes it easier to find and manage items efficiently.\n\n5. Detailed Reporting\n\nGenerate comprehensive reports on stock levels, turnover rates, and inventory costs. These reports provide actionable insights, helping you optimize stock control and reduce waste.\n\nBenefits of Hardware Inventory Software for Stock Control\n\n1. Enhanced Accuracy\n\nAutomation minimizes human errors, ensuring your stock data is precise and reliable. Accurate records help you make informed decisions and avoid costly mistakes.\n\n2. Improved Efficiency\n\nBy automating tasks such as stock counting and reordering, the software saves time and reduces the workload on your staff. This allows your team to focus on more critical business activities.\n\n3. Prevention of Stockouts and Overstocking\n\nHardware inventory software ensures you maintain optimal stock levels. This prevents lost sales due to stockouts and reduces the costs associated with overstocking.\n\n4. Cost Savings\n\nWith better control over inventory, you can reduce waste, avoid over-purchasing, and identify cost-saving opportunities.\n\n5. Simplified Documentation\n\nPrepare and manage essential records, such as invoices and delivery challans, with ease. Using a professional delivery challan format, for instance, ensures accuracy and consistency in your documentation.\n\n6. Data-Driven Decision-Making\n\nThe software\u2019s reporting and analytics capabilities allow you to track inventory trends, identify best-selling items, and adjust your purchasing strategies accordingly.\n\nWhy Accurate Stock Control Matters for Hardware Businesses\n\nAccurate stock control is the foundation of a successful hardware business. It ensures that customers can always find the products they need, enhances your reputation, and maximizes profitability. Conversely, poor inventory management can lead to missed sales opportunities, excess storage costs, and dissatisfied customers.\n\nBy adopting hardware inventory software, you can overcome these challenges and position your business for long-term success. With features like real-time tracking, automated reordering, and detailed reporting, this software provides the tools you need to maintain precise control over your stock.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn today\u2019s competitive market, hardware businesses cannot afford to rely on outdated or error-prone inventory management methods. Hardware inventory software is an essential tool for achieving accurate stock control, improving efficiency, and boosting profitability.\n\nInvest in a reliable solution today to streamline your operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and take your business to the next level."

Explaining this concept, VeChain highlighted that PofP is designed for event managers to facilitate the creation and storage of digital collectibles via a no-code smart contract platform on the VeChainThor blockchain.\n\nProof of Participation (PofP) badges are a great way to introduce NFTs & blockchain to users, but can be difficult/costly to mint. No more! We just launched a no-code PofP module \u2013 FREE! Grab the VeWorld wallet, mint PofPs, & engage your communities, Web3 style!\n\nLinks below\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/WI9ZoQx8Ji\u2014 VeChain (@vechainofficial) December 18, 2024\n\nMore About the PofP Concept\n\nPofP collectibles also exist as NFTs compatible with the ERC 721 standard. They can be saved as digital proof of participation in events (either online or in person). Since they are recorded on the blockchain, attendees can have permanent access to them. Most importantly, they can be traded.\n\nExplaining the concept in a simple scenario, VeChain disclosed that PofP removes the complexities that are associated with blockchain technology to onboard a non-crypto native user for free.\n\nImagine ordering exactly the merch you have to distribute to your visitors and not having to carry boxes around, collect waste, and manage user disappointment when merch is over or has not yet arrived. PofP removes the complexity of blockchain and the need to deal with cryptocurrencies for both you and your users! PofP works with credits, where 1 credit = 1 transaction, effectively onboarding non-crypto-native users on the blockchain for free, thereby potentially increasing client attractiveness and conversion rates.\n\nIn terms of usage, users would be given 20 new free credits each month, according to the blog post. Meanwhile, these can be used to pay for users\u2019 transactions. In situations where the free credit is exhausted, users would have to cover the fees in VTHO. To get started with this, users would first need to create an account, have a logo for every event, a badge to distribute as Proof of Participation, and agree to the terms and conditions of the campaign.\n\nVeChain\u2019s VePassport for Reliable Identity Verification\n\nRecently, VeChain also announced the introduction of a VePassport \u2013 a decentralized identity solution tied to the VeWorld Wallet address within the VeBetterDAO. As we reported, the reason for this initiative was to meet the growing ecosystem and its decentralized governance with an identity disclosure to ensure fair voting and decision-making.\n\nWith this introduction, users must meet qualification criteria to enjoy governance rewards and participate in weekly voting. Some of these qualifications include Proof of Participation via X-Apps, Proof of Equity, and Proof of Identity.\n\nVePassport, alongside the other tools and tweaks introduced in this update, is an important stepping stone toward the future goals of VeBetterDAO and its mission to becoming a leading platform for mass adoption of blockchain and real-world impact\u2026By prioritizing real user growth and a more accommodating baseline for governance, the Better ecosystem continues to champion the spirit of decentralization and further enhance the prospect of the VeChainThor blockchain that lay at its core.\n\nRecommended for you:"

This could reignite acquisition activity by strategic buyers, which would allow funds to distribute proceeds from those deals to their own investors, or limited partners, and raise new funds to invest in the next generation of startups, said Brian Garrett, managing director at Crosscut Ventures.\n\nIn recent years, startups weren't the only ones facing a cash crunch. Established funds raised the lion's share of funding dollars, while many newish and boutique funds struggled to raise. A torrent of dealmaking, combined with Trump's return to the White House and an end to the political uncertainty, could mobilize investors in these funds who had been sitting on the sidelines to whip out their checkbooks, said Ivan Nikkhoo, a managing partner at Navigate Ventures.\n\n\"Uncertainty breeds defense, optimism breeds offense,\" said Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures and early Anthropic investor. \"We're going into a cycle where acquirers are feeling they need to play offense and startups feel like it's time to invest in leadership. And the IPO market is open for best-in-class assets.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom IPOs to robotaxis, these are the tech trends to watch in 2025, according to venture capitalists."

The growing popularity of the company and new product launches helped OpenAI in closing a US$6.6-billion funding round in October.\n\nRival Google released the second generation of its AI model Gemini earlier in December, as the search giant aims to reclaim the lead in the AI technology race. \u2014 Jaspreet Singh, (c) 2024 Reuters\n\nGet breaking news from TechCentral on WhatsApp. Sign up here\n\nDon\u2019t miss:"

            "article_content": "US stocks soared Friday after tame inflation data and dovish comments from the Fed's Austan Goolsbee.\n\nGoolsbee said he expects interest rates to continue to decline over the next 12-18 months.\n\nInvestors are closely monitoring a potential government shutdown and a big triple-witching day for the options market.\n\nUS stocks surged on Friday, recovering some of the week's losses sparked by a hawkish Federal Reserve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 500 points, giving back some of its intraday gains after being up over 800 points. The Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 were up over 1%.\n\nThe market opened lower, though it reversed course later in the morning. The gains accelerated after Fed president Austan Goolsbee told CNBC that he expects interest rates to decline \"a fair bit\" over the next 12-18 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoolsbee, along with the broader market, was encouraged by recent inflation data, which came in below economist estimates.\n\nA slide in bond yields also helped stocks through the day, with the 10-year Treasury yield down four basis points to 4.528%.\n\nThe PCE index, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, rose 0.1% month-over-month in November, compared to economist estimates of 0.2%. On an annual basis, the gauge rose 2.4% versus expectations of 2.5%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're still on path to get to 2% and at least for this new month you don't want to make too much out of any one month, but I'm hopeful that this suggests that the couple of months of firming were more of a bump than a change in path,\" Goolsbee said of the recent inflation data.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood at the 4:oo p.m. closing bell on Friday:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConcerns of an imminent government shutdown have also driven recent market volatility. Congress has until midnight on Friday to pass a deal to avert a shutdown.\n\nWhile Congress had a stopgap funding bill in place a few days ago, President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk torpedoed it, complaining about unnecessary spending measures within the bill.\n\nA second attempt to pass a government funding bill endorsed by Trump failed in the House of Representatives late Thursday evening, with a final vote of 174 for and 235 against.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has since proposed a new plan that would temporarily keep the government open and fund disaster aid. The bill reportedly has support from Republicans, and is set for a vote later on Friday.\n\nFor his part, President Trump has said that he wants to see an elimination of the debt ceiling, or at least extend a pause of the debt ceiling to 2029 when his second term ends.\n\nHouse Speaker Johnson's new bill does not include the elimination of the debt ceiling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraders are also on watch at the close amid the quarterly \"triple-witching,\" with about $6.5 trillion worth of options tied to stocks and ETFs set to expire.\n\nHere's what else happened today:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn commodities, bonds, and crypto:"

            "article_content": "\n\nAs Valve appears to be ready to bring back third-party Steam machines, the next edition of CES could be quite interesting for PC gaming handheld enthusiasts. Indeed, Lenovo may be one of the first manufacturers to launch a new model running Valve\u2019s SteamOS instead of Windows 11.\n\nLast week, Evan Blass leaked some pictures of what could be the Legion Go S, an upcoming gaming handheld from Lenovo. Some of these pictures showed what looks like a Steam button on the left side of the screen, suggesting that the device could run SteamOS instead of Windows 11. However, another picture showing the same device in white had a different logo near that same button, so maybe a Windows version is in the cards as well.\n\nAnyway, Lenovo seems to have confirmed that something related to Valve and gaming handhelds will happen at CES: Yesterday, the company sent email invites to journalists for a CES event where it\u2019s planning to discuss \u201cwhat lies ahead in the gaming handheld space and showcasing our latest Lenovo Legion Go innovations advanced by AMD.\u201d As reported by The Verge, the invite mentioned the presence of Valve\u2019s \u201cChief Design Architect\u201d Pierre-Loup Griffais.\n\nWindows Intelligence In Your Inbox Sign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday \u2014 and get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field Guides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift! \"*\" indicates required fields Email * Name This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. \u0394\n\nLenovo\u2019s CES event will also feature Jason Ronald, Microsoft VP of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem who also has a new \u201cVP of Next Generation\u201d title. Microsoft is very much interested in gaming handhelds, and the company is still working hard to optimize its Xbox app for PC for smaller screens. Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming also recently confirmed that the company was working on gaming handheld prototypes. However, the exec added that the first Xbox handheld was still a few years out.\n\nWhile both Xbox and PlayStation are working on their own gaming handhelds, Valve has a real shot a growing the SteamOS ecosystem with the help of PC manufacturers. The company also told The Verge earlier this year that it was working to support SteamOS on the Asus ROG Ally, another popular Windows-based gaming handheld."

But a few excavations made it into the field in 2024, and some of their discoveries are remarkable. Israel also sent some of its most treasured discoveries aboard\u2014a boon for many in the US who would like to see them.\n\nWhile the most important discoveries of this past year will not be known for years to come, these are the top stories about archaeological developments related to the land of the Bible, the biblical period, and the early history of Christianity that caught our attention in 2024.\n\n10. A new center in Jerusalem\n\nThe Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) opened its new center in Jerusalem after 14 years of construction. The Jay and Jeanie Schottenstein National Campus for the Archaeology of Israel hasn\u2019t had a grand opening yet\u2014that may still be a year or two away. But the $106 million structure just down the hill from the Israel Museum began inviting the public to see the new archaeological discoveries.\n\nSign up for The Daily Briefing Get the most recent headlines and stories from Christianity Today delivered to your inbox daily.

Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.\n\nArchitect and urban planner Moshe Safdie designed the building to resemble an excavation site. The entrance is covered by a canopy resembling those found at excavations all over Israel. As visitors descend, they see galleries, laboratories, films, and exhibits that display a small portion of the archaeological richness of the Holy Land.\n\n9. The Siege of Jerusalem\n\nThe Assyrian king Sennacherib \u201ccame down\u201d on Jerusalem in 701 BC \u201clike the wolf on the fold,\u201d with his armies \u201cgleaming in purple and gold,\u201d as famously described by the poet Byron. The king, for his part, ordered an inscription memorializing the feat, saying how he\u2019d shut up Hezekiah \u201clike a caged bird in his royal city.\u201d Sennacherib conveniently omitted the fact that he failed to actually take Jerusalem.\n\nThe site of that siege has been identified by archaeologist Stephen Compton using modern mapping techniques.\n\nCompton took a depiction of Sennacherib\u2019s camp from detailed relief panels excavated from Sennacherib\u2019s palace in Ninevah back in 1840, which are now on display at the British Museum. He superimposed that picture on aerial photos of a siege camp at Lachish, Judah\u2019s second largest city, which was conquered in 701 BC.\n\nCompton then looked around Jerusalem and found a similar layout at Ammunition Hill, now remembered as the site of fierce fighting in Israel\u2019s 1967 Six-Day War. It\u2019s a mile and a half north of Jerusalem\u2019s Damascus Gate. Perhaps someday an excavation will search for siege evidence from 701 BC.\n\nAlthough Jerusalem was not conquered by Sennacherib, the Assyrians exacted heavy tribute. Archaeologists also reported the excavation of an administrative center, near the new US Embassy in southern Jerusalem, that may have been used by the Assyrians to collect tribute. Researchers believe it was built on top of an older administrative center, built by King Hezekiah or his father Ahaz and razed by the invaders to demonstrate their authority. Excavation uncovered an array of personalized, stamped handles from storage jars.\n\n8. Skills of the ancient mariners\n\nThe IAA announced the discovery of the deepest and earliest shipwreck ever found in the Eastern Mediterranean. Previously, historians knew of only two Bronze Age shipwrecks in the region, both near the coast of Turkey. This discovery, 56 miles offshore, suggests ancient mariners were venturing far from shore, which would only be possible with well-developed celestial navigation skills.\n\n\u201cThis is a world-class, history-changing discovery,\u201d said Jacob Sharvit, head of the IAA\u2019s marine unit. \u201cThis reveals the ancient mariners\u2019 navigation skills\u2014capable of traversing the Mediterranean Sea without a line of sight to any coast.\u201d\n\nA natural gas company was surveying the sea floor with a submersible robot and came upon a huge pile of jugs a mile below the surface. A few of the jugs were raised to the surface and identified as Late Bronze Age Canaanite storage vessels from the 14th\u201313th century BC. The Canaanites later became known as seafaring Phoenicians and developed a trading network that ranged across the Mediterranean Sea during the Iron Age.\n\n7. A libation token\n\nClay seal impressions with images and letters on one flat side and perhaps the impression on the other are common in biblical archaeology. It\u2019s quite rare to find a blob of ancient clay that is pinched on one side with writing and an image on the reverse, but that\u2019s what a team at the Temple Mount Sifting Project found.\n\nThe discovery, made in 2011, was identified in 2024 as a pilgrim\u2019s token, which could be exchanged for an offering at the temple. The wine jar depicted on the token may indicate it was payment for wine to be poured out on the temple altar. The use of such tokens is described in the Mishna, the oral Jewish law compiled in the second century.\n\n6. Canaanite complex conundrums\n\nSome of the excavations that took place in 2024 explored Canaanite cult complexes dating to the Early Bronze Age, 1,000 years before Abraham, and to the Late Bronze Age, around the time of the Exodus.\n\nSalvage archaeologists preparing the way for urban expansion excavated a site near Beit Shemesh this year and found a building that had been used for ritual activity before being suddenly abandoned. Tiny cultic vessels, which probably had a symbolic purpose, were still intact.\n\nFew similar public buildings from the period have been found in Israel, and this site is helping archaeologists develop their understanding of early urbanization.\n\nAbout six miles south, another Canaanite cult complex has been uncovered at Tel Azekah. Archaeologists say it began as an open-air sanctuary with a spectacular view and was later enclosed. It was dubbed \u201cthe Temple of the Rising Sun.\u201d\n\nTen miles further south, the 14th season of excavation at Tel Burna ended after just three weeks because of the war, with some significant mysteries still unsolved. Archaeologists believe they discovered the part of the cultic complex where the priests lived, but they still don\u2019t know why the religious site appears to have strong cultural connections with Cyprus, which is located 300 miles away in the Mediterranean. And they don\u2019t know why such a large site\u2014perhaps the largest Canaanite cult complex of the Late Bronze Age\u2014was located so far from the coastal trade routes.\n\n\u201cHow did these hillbilly Canaanites build this cult complex?\u201d said Lipscomb University archaeologist Steven Ortiz, who joined the project in 2018, in an interview with CT.\n\nOngoing research at a mysterious mud-brick arch atop Tel Shimron in northern Israel uncovered a great quantity of Canaanite cultic objects. Next to the arch, in a depression that\u2019s called a favissa\u2014a place where sacrificial objects are discarded\u2014researchers found two bronze bull figurines, which are typically connected to the worship of El, the head of the Canaanite pantheon, or the storm god Baal. They also found 40,000 animal bones and 57,000 pottery shards, including remnants of a rare Minoan jug from Crete.\n\n\u201cIn terms of religion, we don\u2019t have anything like this,\u201d archaeologist Daniel Master said. \u201cThis is on a scale that we don\u2019t have anywhere else in this region.\u201d\n\n5. The gate of Shiloh\n\nWhen the Israelites lost the ark of the covenant to the Philistines, the priest Eli fell off his chair and broke his neck at the gate of Shiloh (1 Sam. 4:18). In 2024, the excavation by the Associates for Biblical Research at Tel Shiloh finished uncovering that gate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a niche in the fortification wall. We put a beam into that niche, and it goes right across the top of the pillars,\u201d excavation director Scott Stripling told Christianity Today.\n\nNear the pillars, archaeologists also found geometric paving stones forming a plaza, which is unexpected for that time.\n\nIn another area of the tel, or mound, excavators are uncovering the walls of a building the size of the biblical tabernacle, where the ark of the covenant was kept. They have also discovered a favissa with bones from sacrifices, pottery, and gold objects, which were apparently pendants.\n\n4. Redating a Jerusalem wall\n\nA wall once attributed to King Hezekiah is now thought to have been built earlier by King Uzziah. This indicates that Jerusalem was expanding even before a flood of refugees arrived after the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel in 732 BC.\n\nWhile that reassessment adds valuable insight into the history of the city, it\u2019s also a powerful example of what can be done with a creative combination of complementary technology to establish \u201cabsolute chronology.\u201d\n\nRadiocarbon dating, normally a boon to archaeology, doesn\u2019t work very well for objects made during the Iron Age, due to a cosmic phenomenon known as the Hallstatt Plateau. This has limited the precise dating of archaeological discoveries in Jerusalem during its time as capital of the united Kingdom of Israel and then Judah. For a decade, archaeologists have worked to combine radiocarbon results in four different excavation areas with a precise single-year timeline derived from dendrochronology, the study of tree rings.\n\nThis has led to several redatings, including the wall now attributed to King Uzziah.\n\n3. The start of the alphabet\n\nThe earliest use of alphabetic writing has been pushed back 500 years through the discovery of four small fingers of clay in a tomb at Umm el-Marra in northern Syria. The tomb, which contained burials in gold and silver, was discovered in 2004 and carbon-dated to 2400 BC, the Early Bronze Age, when Umm el-Marra was a crossroad of trade routes between Aleppo and the Euphrates River.\n\nJohns Hopkins University archaeologist Glenn Schwartz was positive about the dating but came slowly to the conclusion that he had found actual alphabetical writing. He went public with his conclusion at November\u2019s annual meeting of the American Society of Overseas Research.\n\n\u201cPreviously, scholars thought the alphabet was invented in or around Egypt sometime after 1900 BCE,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cBut our artifacts are older and from a different area on the map, suggesting the alphabet may have an entirely different origin story than we thought.\u201d\n\nNumerous references to writing in the Old Testament seem to indicate a level of literacy that archaeology has been slow to support. But recent developments, including the discovery that topped CT\u2019s 2022 archaeology list, are providing a fuller picture of early literacy.\n\n2. Jesus recognized in Germany\n\nA silver amulet was found in an 1,800-year-old burial outside Frankfurt in 2018. In 2024, researchers were able to scan the item, virtually unrolling the thin amulet to read the Latin inscription inside, which says the amulet will \u201cprotect the man who surrenders himself to the will of the Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, since before Jesus Christ every knee bows: those in heaven, those on earth and those under the earth, and every tongue confesses.\u201d\n\nThis discovery, announced in December, provides the earliest evidence of Christianity north of the Alps, indicating that Christianity spread to Northern Europe more quickly than had been thought. The person who wore it was buried between the year 230 and 270 AD.\n\n1. A mosaic free from prison\n\nThe Megiddo Mosaic was discovered 20 years ago, but the amazing artifact, built for a small group of Christians who worshiped together about 200 years after the time of Jesus, was inaccessible behind prison walls. In 2024, it was loaned to the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC, and is now widely available for public viewing.\n\nThe mosaic floor includes three well-preserved inscriptions, and one, in Greek, mentions \u201cGod Jesus Christ,\u201d clearly testifying to the recognition of Jesus as more than a good teacher. The design shows the space was intentionally built for Christian worship. Centered on a Communion table, it more closely resembles a Jewish synagogue than the Roman basilica, and depicts two fish, the most popular Christian imagery before Constantine.\n\nThis is only the third church building that archaeologists have discovered that dates to the time before Constantine made Christianity legal in the Roman Empire. There is one at Dura-Europus in Syria and another at the location traditionally believed to be the apostle Peter\u2019s house in Capernaum. Those were both houses converted for worship.\n\nThis mosaic floor was not discovered at Tel Megiddo, a famous archaeological site, but a few miles down the road during the renovation of a prison. The mosaic will be on display at the Museum of the Bible until July. It will eventually return to Israel.\n\nThis is an unusually good time to see biblical archaeology in US museums. In addition to the Megiddo Mosaic, the IAA has a permanent display at the Museum of the Bible called People of the Land, and the IAA also has a traveling exhibit on the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is currently at the Reagan library in California.\n\nThe Tel Dan Stele, which includes the first known reference to the house of David, is on display at the Jewish Museum in New York City through January 5. And Discovering the World of Jesus, which includes the controversial James Ossuary with the inscription \u201cJames, the son of Joseph, the brother of Jesus,\u201d is on display in Atlanta.\n\nGordon Govier writes about biblical archaeology for Christianity Today, hosts the archaeology radio program The Book and The Spade, and is the editor of Artifax."

Since November, there have been numerous drones spotted across the Northeast in multiple states, including New York, Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n\nSome of these drones have flown over U.S. military bases. Government officials continue to investigate, though the Pentagon stated that most drones you see in the air are merely for recreational use and nothing sinister.\n\nAs the NFL nears the conclusion of the 2024 season, the league wants Congress to take action against the U.S. drone invasion, fearing that the flying objects will become an issue at football games.\n\n\u201cThe time for us to act on this is now,\u201d NFL chief security officer Cathy Lanier said, per Sierra Fox of FOX 5 DC.. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to wait until something bad happens.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Aaron Rodgers Unleashes His Own Insane Theory About The Mystery Drones In New Jersey That Have Everyone In America Spooked\n\nClick on \u2018Follow Us\u2019 and get notified of the most viral NFL stories via Google!

            "article_content": "This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nExperimental physicist Daniela Angulo poses with an apparatus in the physics lab at the University of Toronto.\n\nScientists have long known that light can sometimes appear to exit a material before entering it\u2014an effect dismissed as an illusion caused by how waves are distorted by matter.\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Toronto, through innovative quantum experiments, say they have demonstrated that \"negative time\" isn't just a theoretical idea\u2014it exists in a tangible, physical sense, deserving closer scrutiny.\n\nThe findings, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, have attracted both global attention and skepticism.\n\nThe researchers emphasize that these perplexing results highlight a peculiar quirk of quantum mechanics rather than a radical shift in our understanding of time.\n\n\"This is tough stuff, even for us to talk about with other physicists. We get misunderstood all the time,\" said Aephraim Steinberg, a University of Toronto professor specializing in experimental quantum physics.\n\nWhile the term \"negative time\" might sound like a concept lifted from science fiction, Steinberg defends its use, hoping it will spark deeper discussions about the mysteries of quantum physics.\n\nLaser experiments\n\nYears ago, the team began exploring interactions between light and matter.\n\nWhen light particles, or photons, pass through atoms, some are absorbed by the atoms and later re-emitted. This interaction changes the atoms, temporarily putting them in a higher-energy or \"excited\" state before they return to normal.\n\nIn research led by Daniela Angulo, the team set out to measure how long these atoms stayed in their excited state. \"That time turned out to be negative,\" Steinberg explained\u2014meaning a duration less than zero.\n\nTo visualize this concept, imagine cars entering a tunnel: before the experiment, physicists recognized that while the average entry time for a thousand cars might be, for example, noon, the first cars could exit a little sooner, say 11:59 am. This result was previously dismissed as meaningless.\n\nWhat Angulo and colleagues demonstrated was akin to measuring carbon monoxide levels in the tunnel after the first few cars emerged and finding that the readings had a minus sign in front of them.\n\nRelativity intact\n\nThe experiments, conducted in a cluttered basement laboratory bristling with wires and aluminum-wrapped devices, took over two years to optimize. The lasers used had to be carefully calibrated to avoid distorting the results.\n\nStill, Steinberg and Angulo are quick to clarify: no one is claiming time travel is a possibility. \"We don't want to say anything traveled backward in time,\" Steinberg said. \"That's a misinterpretation.\"\n\nThe explanation lies in quantum mechanics, where particles like photons behave in fuzzy, probabilistic ways rather than following strict rules.\n\nInstead of adhering to a fixed timeline for absorption and re-emission, these interactions occur across a spectrum of possible durations\u2014some of which defy everyday intuition.\n\nCritically, the researchers say, this doesn't violate Einstein's theory of special relativity, which dictates that nothing can travel faster than light. These photons carried no information, sidestepping any cosmic speed limits.\n\nA divisive discovery\n\nThe concept of \"negative time\" has drawn both fascination and skepticism, particularly from prominent voices in the scientific community.\n\nGerman theoretical physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, for one, criticized the work in a YouTube video viewed by over 250,000 people, noting, \"The negative time in this experiment has nothing to do with the passage of time\u2014it's just a way to describe how photons travel through a medium and how their phases shift.\"\n\nAngulo and Steinberg pushed back, arguing that their research addresses crucial gaps in understanding why light doesn't always travel at a constant speed.\n\nSteinberg acknowledged the controversy surrounding their paper's provocative headline but pointed out that no serious scientist has challenged the experimental results.\n\n\"We've made our choice about what we think is a fruitful way to describe the results,\" he said, adding that while practical applications remain elusive, the findings open new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena.\n\n\"I'll be honest, I don't currently have a path from what we've been looking at toward applications,\" he admitted. \"We're going to keep thinking about it, but I don't want to get people's hopes up.\"\n\n\u00a9 2024 AFP"

            "article_content": "The relationship with our babies can often be seen as a dance\u2014a give-and-take of eye contact, touch, gestures, and emotions between parent and child. This metaphorical dance finds its scientific grounding in the concept of biobehavioral synchrony. Defined as the dynamic and reciprocal adaptation of behaviors and biology between two people, synchrony plays a foundational role in a child\u2019s development. It shapes emotional, cognitive, and social outcomes, setting the stage for healthy development.\n\nBut what does this mean for one of the most challenging aspects of parenting: infant sleep?\n\nMy intention in this month\u2019s blog post is to explore the findings from Lecl\u00e8re et al.'s review (1) on synchrony and connect them to the art of nurturing infant sleep, offering insights for parents and professionals alike.\n\nBiobehavioral Synchrony: A Foundation for Development\n\nLecl\u00e8re et al.\u2019s review spans decades of research, analyzing studies that illuminate how mother-child synchrony influences developmental trajectories. Synchrony is not just about physical proximity or shared time; it\u2019s a dynamic, moment-to-moment alignment of emotions, gestures, and rhythms. Whether it\u2019s a shared gaze, vocalizations, or synchronized gestures, these micro-interactions lay the groundwork for critical developmental processes.\n\nFor example, Ruth Feldman\u2019s longitudinal studies, highlighted in the review, demonstrate that early synchrony predicts long-term outcomes like empathy, school readiness, and emotional regulation. Similarly, the well-known \u201cstill-face\u201d paradigm by Cohn and Tronick shows how even brief disruptions in synchrony can distress infants, underscoring its role in fostering emotional security.\n\nThe implications are profound: synchrony is not merely a passive byproduct of healthy interactions but an active process that molds a child\u2019s brain and behavior. This insight becomes especially relevant when considering infant sleep, an area where synchrony\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014 plays a central role.\n\nThe Role of Synchrony in Infant Sleep\n\nInfant sleep is not just a biological necessity; it\u2019s also a social process deeply intertwined with emotional regulation and attachment. The findings from Lecl\u00e8re et al.\u2019s review highlight several ways that synchrony may influence sleep:\n\n1. Nervous System Regulation\n\nSynchrony serves as a co-regulatory mechanism for infants, providing the external support needed to settle into sleep. Through attuned interactions, caregivers help align an infant\u2019s physiological rhythms to states conducive to rest. For example, a parent\u2019s gentle rocking or soothing voice can create a calming effect, guiding the infant toward relaxation and eventual sleep.\n\nResearch on oxytocin underscores this connection. Oxytocin, often called the \u201clove hormone,\u201d plays a fundamental role in biobehavioral synchrony. Elevated oxytocin levels during synchronized mother-infant interactions have been linked to enhanced emotional regulation in infants, which is critical for making the transition from wakefulness to sleep smoother and less stressful.\n\n2. Stress Reduction\n\nInfants are highly sensitive to disruptions in synchrony, as shown in the \u201cstill-face\u201d paradigm. These disruptions can increase cortisol levels, a stress hormone that interferes with sleep. By maintaining synchrony, caregivers can buffer against stress, creating a calm and secure environment that promotes restorative sleep.\n\n3. Attachment Security\n\nAttachment theory emphasizes the importance of secure attachment, and synchrony is a vital ingredient in its formation. Attachment can be understood as the balance between two fundamental needs: the secure base from which to explore and the safe haven to return to in times of distress. For infants, falling asleep alone often activates the attachment system, triggering a need for reassurance and safety. When caregivers fulfill their \u201csafe haven\u201d role\u2014through physical presence, soothing interactions, or attuned responses\u2014they provide infants with a \u201cfelt sense\u201d of safety in their bodies. This sense of safety enables infants to relax and transition into sleep, confident that they are protected and cared for.\n\n4. Routine and Predictability\n\nSynchrony naturally incorporates elements of routine, as caregivers intuitively adapt to their infant\u2019s needs and cues. Predictable, synchronized interactions during bedtime can signal to the infant that it\u2019s time to sleep. This alignment between caregiver actions and infant expectations fosters a smoother transition to sleep.\n\nPractical Strategies for Nurturing Infant Sleep through Synchrony\n\nThe science of biobehavioral synchrony provides valuable insights for supporting infant sleep. Here are some practical strategies:\n\n1. Follow the Infant\u2019s Cues\n\nInfants communicate their needs through subtle cues, such as eye contact, vocalizations, and body movements. By responding promptly and appropriately, caregivers can establish synchrony, fostering a sense of safety that promotes sleep.\n\n2. Create a Synchronized Bedtime Routine\n\nA bedtime routine aligned with the infant\u2019s natural rhythms helps signal that it\u2019s time to wind down. Activities like bathing, singing lullabies, massage, rocking, or feeding can be synchronized with the infant\u2019s cues to create a calming sleep environment.\n\n3. Use Gentle Touch and Movement\n\nRocking, swaying, or rhythmic patting can synchronize with an infant\u2019s physiological rhythms, promoting relaxation. Skin-to-skin contact or gentle massages also enhance oxytocin release, further supporting sleep.\n\n4. Maintain Emotional Availability\n\nA caregiver\u2019s emotional state profoundly impacts synchrony. Staying regulated and present during bedtime routines provides the co-regulation infants need to settle into sleep. Emotional availability allows the caregiver to respond attuned to the infant\u2019s cues, fostering calm and security. Practicing daily nervous system regulation\u2014such as mindfulness, deep breathing, or brief moments of self-care\u2014can strengthen the caregiver\u2019s capacity to remain grounded, which in turn helps co-regulate the infant more effectively.\n\n5. Address Sleep Disruptors\n\nRecognizing and mitigating sleep disruptors\u2014for both the infant and the parent\u2014can help sustain synchrony. Environmental factors like noise, room temperature, and light exposure can be adjusted to create an optimal sleep environment. Equally important is adult sleep hygiene. Small changes, such as maintaining a consistent time to go to bed, incorporating calming pre-sleep rituals, and avoiding phone scrolling at night can make a significant difference in the adult\u2019s capacity for synchrony and consequently protect infant sleep needs.\n\nSynchrony as the Heartbeat of Nurturing Sleep\n\nSynchrony can be seen as the heartbeat of nurturing infant sleep interactions. By fostering synchrony through attuned interactions, caregivers can create a nurturing environment that supports both the immediate goal of restful sleep and the long-term goal of healthy development.\n\nFor parents and professionals, understanding the science of biobehavioral synchrony offers a powerful framework for addressing sleep challenges. In the dance of caregiving, synchrony is the rhythm that guides each step, ensuring that both parent and child move together toward rest, connection, and growth."

            "article_content": "At 48, Noam Shazeer stands as an iconic figure in the world of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nKnown as a brilliant yet defiant trailblazer, Shazeer\u2019s journey through the tech landscape is nothing short of dramatic.\n\nHe lives in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, arguably the beating heart of the global tech revolution.\n\nCoder\n\nHis coding brilliance has often placed him at the frontier of technological innovation \u2014 and rebellion.\n\nShazeer took up Computer Science and Mathematics at Duke. This rigorous combination laid the foundation for his deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, and mathematical modeling.\n\nIn the early 2000s, after completing his degree, Shazeer joined Google, ready to leave his mark on the nascent tech giant.\n\nDad of spelling corrector\n\nOne of his earliest triumphs?\n\nElevating Google\u2019s \"spelling corrector\" to unprecedented accuracy. It was a quiet, but profound, revolution for the search engine millions would come to rely on. It turns out spelling snafus could be solved by mathematics, thanks to geniuses like Shazeer.\n\nShazeer\u2019s brilliance thrived on boldness. He had invented much of the current revolution in large language models (LLMs).\n\nSome of his inventions include:\n\nSparsely-gated mixture of experts (2016): It utilises a number of \"experts\", each a simple feed-forward neural network, and a trainable gating network which selects a sparse combination of the experts to process each input (\n\nTransformer (2017): He personally designed the multi-head attention, the residual architecture, and coded up the first better-than-state-of-the-art working implementation.\n\nMesh-Tensorflow (2018): The first practical system for training giant Transformers on supercomputers.\n\nT5 (2019): Major contributor to Google\u2019s LaMDA dialog system (a project led by Daniel De Freitas, Shazeer\u2019s co-founder at Character AI).\n\nFast-forward\n\nFast forward two decades to 2021.\n\nShazeer walked away from Google, with Daniel De Freitas, a skilled AI researcher. This tandem with De Freitas was united by a shared vision \u2014 and frustration.\n\nShazeer was raised in a household with a strong academic background: His dad, a multilingual math-teacher-turned engineer, and his mother, a dedicated homemaker, who fostered an environment that valued education and curiosity.\n\nDe Freitas, for his part, spent his early years traveling with his mother. They lived in various countries including Venezuela and the UK and eventually settled in Florida with his adoptive father. His multicultural upbringing exposed De Freitas to diverse cultures and languages, giving him a strong background in natural language processing (NLP).\n\nNLP involves teaching computers to understand and generate human-like text.\n\nWhile working at Google, De Freitas and Shazeer developed \"Meena\", an advanced chatbot praised for its conversational capabilities.\n\nBloomberg reported in August that Character.AI co-founders Noam Shazeer (right) and Daniel De Freitas were \u201chired\u201d by Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent firm), along with some members of its research team, in a \u201clicensing deal\u201d. Image Credit: Character AI\n\nTogether, they had developed Meena, an advanced AI chatbot destined to reshape conversational AI. Yet, Google hesitated, shelving the project. The reason was unclear.\n\nDisillusioned, the pair left to chart their own course, founding Character.AI, a platform that would become synonymous with cutting-edge generative AI.\n\nWhy did he leave Google?\n\n\u201cI have always been excited about AI,\" Shazeer said in an interview on a16z.com. \"I just wanted to move, push technology forward.\u201d\n\nLarge Language Models Large Language Models (LLMs) are computer programs that can understand and generate text, much like a human.\n\n\n\nThey work by studying huge amounts of text from the internet, books, and other sources, learning patterns, meanings, and how words fit together.\n\n\n\nSo, when you ask them a question or give them a task (like writing an email), they use what they've learned to predict and create a response that makes sense.\n\n\n\nThink of them as super-smart text predictors that can chat, write, and answer questions!\n\nCharacter.AI\n\nAfter Character.ai was launched, it soared, raising over $150 million in funding. But the story didn\u2019t end there.\n\nCharacter.ai is new kind of conversational AI. Unlike typical chatbots, Character.ai enables users to interact with AI personas that simulate human conversation on a deep level. Users can engage with historical figures, fictional characters, or entirely customised personas.\n\nSome kids (including my 11-year-old son Toffee) describe it as the \"app for weirdos\".\n\nCharacter.AI has faced criticism.\n\nFor one, the app allows users to create and interact with AI personas, including fictional characters, celebrities, and historical figures. It's a deliberate choice on the part of its creators, with niche use-cases, unconventional user behaviour, and a unique way of engaging users with AI-generated personalities.\n\nMany users engage in role-playing or fantasy-based conversations, which can range from innocent fun to deeply personal or unconventional scenarios.\n\nCases against Character.ai The AI chatbot platform has faced serious allegations linking its services to user self-harm and suicide. Notably:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Florida Lawsuit (October 2024): Megan Garcia filed a lawsuit against Character.AI and Google, alleging that the platform contributed to her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III's suicide. The lawsuit claims that Sewell developed an emotional relationship with a chatbot impersonating Daenerys Targaryen from \"Game of Thrones,\" which led to his tragic death.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Texas Lawsuit (December 2024): Two families in Texas sued Character.AI, alleging that the platform encouraged self-harm and provided inappropriate content to their children. One case involved a 17-year-old who began self-harming after a chatbot introduced the topic, while another involved exposure to inappropriate content, New York Post reported.\n\n\n\nIn response to these incidents, Character.AI has implemented new safety measures, including separate language models for adult and teenage users, stricter content restrictions, and parental controls to monitor usage.\n\nYet the high level of customisation that Character.AI brings to the realm of chatbots cannot be denied. Moreover, the imaginative interaction appeals to niche communities, though it may seem eccentric or \u201cweird\u201d to outsiders.\n\nThe platform's other key strength: natural-language understanding and adaptability, thus creating immersive and life-like interactions.\n\n$ 2.7 b amount reportedly paid by Google to take back Noam Shazeer\n\nNow, in a twist worthy of a Hollywood script, reports surfaced in August 2024 that Shazeer and DeFreitas were returning to their roots \u2014 Google.\n\nThe tech giant, perhaps eager to reclaim its prodigal sons, reportedly paid a staggering $2.7 million to bring Shazeer back into the fold.\n\nCHARACTER.AI FEATURES One of Character.ai\u2019s standout features is its customisation. Users can craft their own unique AI characters by setting their personalities, backstories, and responses.\n\n\n\nThis flexibility has attracted creators, educators, and enthusiasts who enjoy building characters tailored to specific needs, whether for entertainment, role-playing, or learning.\n\n\n\nDiverse Use Cases\n\nCharacter.ai is not just for casual conversation\u2014it caters to diverse applications. Students use it to \"talk\" with historical figures for educational purposes.\n\n\n\nWriters use it as a tool for brainstorming ideas with fictional characters, and fans use it to interact with avatars of their favorite icons. It\u2019s a fusion of learning, creativity, and entertainment.\n\n\n\nCharacter.ai is built with privacy in mind, as interactions on the platform are not stored for long-term use, prioritizing user trust. It\u2019s also designed to be intuitive, requiring no technical skills to create or interact with characters, making it accessible for both casual users and professionals.\n\n\u201cI am super excited to return to Google and work as part of the Google DeepMind team,\u201d Shazeer told TechCrunch. \u201cSo proud of everything we\u2019ve built at Character.AI over the last three years.\u201d\n\nDeepMind\n\nGoogle, too, made no attempt to hide its enthusiasm. In a statement dripping with admiration, the company said: \"We\u2019re particularly thrilled to welcome back Noam, a preeminent researcher in machine learning, who is joining Google\u2019s DeepMind research team, along with a small number of his colleagues.\"\n\nDeFreitas, equally integral to this saga, is also set to rejoin the search titan, solidifying their return as a monumental homecoming for Google.\n\nSpecific figures for Daniel De Freitas's return have not been publicly disclosed. Since both played key roles in the creation of Character.AI and are valuable AI researchers, it is likely that De Freitas's compensation was similarly significant, though details remain speculative.\n\nHigh-stake AI\n\nAs part of the agreement, Character.AI will reportedly benefit from increased funding, ensuring that the legacy of their groundbreaking work lives on.\n\nFrom maverick departures to celebrated returns, Shazeer\u2019s story (and, by extension, De Freitas's too) is a testament to the unrelenting push-and-pull of innovation in the high-stakes world of AI."
