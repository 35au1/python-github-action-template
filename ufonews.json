            "article_content": "Another mysterious 'orange UFO orb' was spotted flying over the US, however, this time the inexplicable glow was seen conspicuously hovering over a military base in Tennessee.\n\nAn anonymous user on Reddit captured footage of a mystifying 'bright orange light' flying relatively low as it traveled over Fort Campbell - a military base along the Tennessee-Kentucky border - on New Year's Day.\n\nThe user, who witnessed the perplexing 'celestial' event alongside their father, who is a seasoned Army veteran, said that they 'couldn't explain' what they were seeing in the skies above.\n\n'My dad, a former soldier with nearly 30 years of Army experience and extensive knowledge of the aircrafts that fly over his house, said he couldn\u2019t explain what he saw - this was unlike anything he\u2019d encountered before,' the post reads.\n\nAround 12:10am on January 1, the Redditor, who was visiting family in a city just outside Nashville, tried to capture the object 'as quickly as possible,' snapping a near 35-second clip of the glowing orb.\n\n'Just after midnight, my dad was outside watching fireworks when he noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low and maintaining a steady, consistent speed as it traveled from the northwest - where both Fort Campbell and the local airport are located,' the user claimed.\n\nThe curious onlookers were mystified at the unidentified flying object as it did not appear to have any additional lights as they suspect most drones do.\n\n'My friend, dad, and I watched the object together and were surprised it had no additional lights, as one might expect on a drone,' the post adds.\n\nAn anonymous user on Reddit captured footage of a mystifying 'bright orange light' flying relatively low as it traveled over Fort Campbell - a military base along the Tennessee-Kentucky border, on New Year's Day\n\nAround 12:10am on January 1, the user, who was visiting family in a city just outside Nashville, then tried to capture the object 'as quickly as possible,' snapping a near 35-second clip of the glowing orb\n\n'Initially, I thought it might be a hobbyist drone capturing footage of the fireworks for the New Year, but the apparent distance it was flying has made me second-guess that assumption.'\n\nBright high-flying 'orange UFO orbs' have been spotted across the US in recent weeks with the most recent sighting surfacing over New York City.\n\nOn December 27, Reddit user @YogurtclosetFlat5701 posted a video of the inexplicable luminous object to the 'The UFOs Subreddit' - a forum for UFO discussions where people can talk about sightings, experiences, news and investigations.\n\nThe local recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport.\n\n'We looked up and there were 4 orange orbs in formation in what is suppose to be a no fly zone they then started to disappear,' the user wrote.\n\nIn the video, four unblinking orange orbs are suspended in the air, forming a striking boomerang shape.\n\nA video was taken from inside the user's car and another from outside the user's car.\n\n'They were moving oddly like not completely stationary and then started to disappear one by one. The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nUsers local to the New York City area also confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nOther Redditors deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious and were shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a f*** about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on December 26 when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upward or downward.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "> Space\n\nAfter calls with foreign leaders, rap sessions with lawmakers, and long classified briefings with advisers, President Jimmy Carter would often escape to the roof of the White House.\n\nThere his son Jeffrey had set up a tracking telescope, Carter said in his book, A Full Life. Feeling the weight of the world, he would gaze at the stars and contemplate his place among them.\n\n\"I recall one winter night going to the White House roof to study the Orion nebulae, but we could barely see the stars, their images so paled by city lights,\" he waxed in a poem.\n\nThat particular evening, on Dec. 18, 1977, the astrophysicist Carl Sagan joined him. They had just visited the U.S. Naval Observatory next to the vice president\u2019s mansion, where they discussed all things space \u2014 planets , stars, black holes , and astrobiology . Carter himself was a man of science: He studied engineering in college and did graduate work in nuclear physics .\n\n\"It was a welcome diversion from earthly concerns,\" he wrote in a thank-you note to Sagan.\n\nCarter, who died on Dec. 29, 2024 at 100, was an avid astronomer, with a profound curiosity for the cosmos, a part of his story that isn't well-known. It began when he was a lab assistant to an astronomy teacher his freshman year in college, and it continued as he learned celestial navigation in the U.S. Navy, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant. One Christmas while on a ship with his family, he asked the captain if the crew had a sextant on board, a tool for measuring the angle between the horizon and an object in the sky. The captain proceeded to show him one, he said , displayed like a museum artifact in a glass case.\n\nBut politics often eclipsed the former president's appreciation for space. Though his first budget funded the program that became NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope, Carter was maligned for not supporting human spaceflight in the vein of the Apollo program, said Steven Hochman, former special assistant to the president at the Carter Center. He was a supporter of robotic exploration and research that could benefit people's lives, but when it came to the exorbitant cost of sending astronauts into deep space , he preferred spending on domestic concerns.\n\n\"NASA, I believe, has not given him the credit he deserves,\" Hochman told Mashable. \"I believe it is because he was critical of the Space Shuttle program and didn't provide funding for future missions to the moon or Mars.\"\n\nFor years political adversaries ridiculed Carter for having a tinfoil hat, stemming from an incident in 1969 that later circulated in the press. After a Lions Club meeting in Leary, Georgia, Carter and a few other men spotted something strange moving in the sky: a luminous object, first blue then red, the apparent size and brightness of the moon . About four years later, Carter reported the unidentified flying object to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena and the International UFO Bureau in Oklahoma.\n\nThough Carter never claimed to have spotted aliens or a flying saucer \u2014 to him this was literally an unknown object in the air \u2014 people snickered and mistook his UFO sighting as such. Skeptics, who likely knew nothing of Carter's astronomy background, suggested he had merely seen Venus .\n\n\"It was not Venus,\" Carter said in a 2007 interview on \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" podcast.\n\nIn fact, his UFO sighting had taken on such mythic proportions, some had wondered whether it was the reason Carter wanted NASA to investigate UFOs in 1977. Despite a White House request expressing a need to address the general UFO \"public relations problem,\" NASA had, surprisingly, declined.\n\nThe subject prompted The Journal of Scientific Exploration to invite Richard C. Henry, the agency's deputy director of astrophysics during Carter's administration, to write an essay about it more than a decade later. Henry, a semi-retired professor at Johns Hopkins University today, came to no definitive conclusions on why NASA rebuffed the White House. But, in a postscript , Henry said he sent his draft to Carter before publication in 1988.\n\n\"The most important point that you could clarify, if you will, is whether you yourself were behind (the UFO panel proposal) letter of July 21, 1977, to NASA,\" Henry wrote.\n\nBeside the sentence, Carter jotted his reply in one word: No.\n\nYet buried within Henry's paper was a small window into Carter's passion for astronomy. In November 1977, the president and his son sent a message to NASA headquarters asking to borrow a seven-inch Questar telescope. Given that there were no telescopes at headquarters \u2014 just paper, Henry said \u2014 he tried to hunt one down at another NASA campus.\n\nIt turned out Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, had one.\n\n\"By great luck, a NASA plane was flying from Huntsville to Washington the next day ([Science adviser Frank] Press was emphatic that the President wanted no special flights or other waste of taxpayer dollars),\" Henry wrote.\n\nThe NASA official and his wife, Rita Mahon, picked up the Questar at Washington National Airport and promptly took it to the White House. They then unpacked the telescope from a large wooden crate and showed the Carters how to set it up on the Truman balcony overlooking the South Lawn. The night was cloudy, but they trained on the moon.\n\nThe president then proceeded to take the telescope with him to Camp David near Thurmont, Maryland, on Nov. 23, 1977, where he and his family spent Thanksgiving, according to his daily diary . He returned it about a week later.\n\nOne has to wonder if Carter brought a telescope with him again just 10 months later, when he invited Egyptian President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to join him at the retreat. The renowned talks would result in the Camp David Accords , which later earned the Middle East leaders a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThere's an amusing irony to the false urban legend that Carter believed he was visited by aliens: He is, after all, the most likely person to make humanity's introduction to extraterrestrials.\n\nSome 15.5 billion miles away from Earth, hurtling through the cold, uncharted abyss, is NASA's Voyager 1 probe. It is the farthest spacecraft from home, having left the solar system in 2012. Soaring through interstellar space at 38,000 mph , it carries a gold-plated record produced by Sagan, with a melange of sounds from the planet.\n\nCrickets. Wind. Greetings in 55 languages, from Akkadian to Wu. A mother kissing her child. These and a letter from Carter are among the recordings on the disk.\n\nThe odds of making contact with aliens, if they exist, are slight, if not insurmountable. Galaxies are spinning away from each other into the infinite unknown. The speed at which space is expanding far outpaces our technology to overcome it. It's as if the universe were contrived to keep its inhabitants apart.\n\nBut should some other intelligent life forms encounter Voyager \u2014 or Voyager 2 , which carries a duplicate record \u2014 thousands or even billions of years into the future, they will discover Carter's words:\n\n\"This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings,\" he wrote. \"We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe.\"\n\nMany knew Carter's intimate relationship with his faith. He grew up Southern Baptist, the son of a farmer in the boomtown of Plains, Georgia. He referred to himself as a born-again Christian. Long after his presidency, he attended regular church services and taught Sunday School .\n\nBut how his evangelical beliefs squared with his thoughts on the universe aren't clear. He wrote in a poem, titled \"Considering the Void:\"\n\nWhen I behold the charm / of evening skies, their lulling endurance; / the patterns of stars with names / of bears and dogs, a swan, a virgin; / other planets that our Voyager showed / were like and so unlike our own, / with all their moons, / bright discs, weird rings, and cratered faces; / comets with their streaming tails / bent by pressure from our sun; / the skyscape of our Milky Way / holding in its shimmering disc /an infinity of suns / (or say a thousand billion); / knowing there are holes of darkness / gulping mass and even light, / knowing that this galaxy of ours / is one of multitudes / in what we call the heavens, / it troubles me. It troubles me.\n\nWhat exactly was haunting Carter? Was he expressing a collision of faith and science in what lies beyond? An existential crisis of never knowing the big picture?\n\nPerhaps, as he wished, humankind will survive this time so that we may live to know more."

About 100-150 mph,\" Chiao told the Post.\n\nHe joked that if they had hit him, \"no one would have known what happened to me. They probably would attribute it to a bird strike or running into a big turkey buzzard or something.\"\n\nThe spacewalker repeated his military theory to The Hill but admitted \"It's hard to say.\"\n\n\"Frankly, I think whoever was operating the drone wasn't aware that I was there.\"\n\nChiao spoke out about his thoughts regarding the spate of drones seen flying over New Jersey recently, saying it is \"hard to believe\" the government does not know what is happening.\n\nHe called for more transparency saying, \"They could tell us what they know.\"\n\n\"If they really don't know, that's a little more disconcerting,\" he said of the objects spotted over New Jersey and various sensitive US sites.\n\nMetallic orbs like those seen by Chiao are the most commonly reported sighting logged by US military witnesses, according to the director of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\n\nDr Sean Kirkpatrick told NASA's UFO advisory group last year that these orbs have been seen \"all over the world\" adding, \"we see these making very interesting apparent manoeuvres.\"\n\n\"In all my years of flying, nobody\u2019s ever saw a UFO or something weird,\" Chiao told The Post, later adding, \"If I had been looking the other way I wouldn\u2019t have seen \u2018em. Wouldn\u2019t have felt anything.\"\n\nCHINESE SPY BOTS?\n\nMeanwhile, a top US congressman has claimed that the mystery drones that swarmed over New Jersey are likely spy bots from China.\n\nMichael McCaul said he believes that at least some of the droves are malicious surveillance from the eastern superpower.\n\nThe chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee blasted Joe Biden's administration over the lack of information about the unusual activity.\n\n\"We want answers but the response I\u2019m getting is - we don\u2019t know what these drones are,\" the Republican fumed.\n\nMcCaul added that Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator had reports saying that the drones were the size of SUVs flying over \"military sites and bases\" suggesting they are \"adversarial\" rather than \"friendly.\"\n\nMcCaul concluded: \u201cI believe they\u2019re spy drones and the PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] is very good at this stuff.\n\n\u201cWe know they bought land around military bases.\n\n\u201cThis would be very consistent with their policy over the past couple years.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not getting answers and I think it\u2019s because our government does not know who is behind them and that is very disturbing to me,\" he added.\n\nChina has not publicly commented on the accusations.\n\n6 Chiao said he only survived the incident with the two orbs thanks to 'dumb luck' Credit: Channel 4\n\n6 Chiao called for more transparency from the Pentagon regarding the bizarre sightings Credit: Reuters"

She always looks amazing.\n\n'She has a style formula and sticks to it. For royal occasions, she chooses belted tea dresses, in bright colours, often with dramatic sleeves.\n\n'She looks stunning, a far cry from jodhpurs and mucking out gear!'\n\nOne of the equestrian's standout looks from 2024 was the burgundy trouser-suit that she picked for Kate's comeback Christmas carol concert at Westminster Abbey last month.\n\nAmong the European royal ladies, Princess Sofia of Sweden also splurged on a new wardrobe comprising 97 new pieces that reportedly cost \u00a3101,562 (\u20ac122,452) in total.\n\nHer sister-in-law and the wife of Prince Carl Philip, Crown Princess Victoria acquired new clothes worth nearly \u00a368,000 (\u20ac81,717).\n\nRanked 12th on the list was Queen Maxima of the Netherlands after the value of her clothes was estimated at around \u00a350,000 (\u20ac59,726), followed by Queen Letizia of Spain and Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit."

            "article_content": "Adam Spatacco\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nWithout question, semiconductor stocks have been some of the biggest winners amid the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. While stars such as Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Broadcom fetch the most attention, investing in the chip sector at large during the past two years has yielded market-beating returns.\n\nAs of market close on Dec. 20, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF had gained 39% in 2024 \u2014 handily topping the returns of both the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).\n\nNevertheless, not all semiconductor stocks have fared so well. Take Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), for example \u2014 with shares up a piddling 6% in 2024, investors might think this particular chip stock is a bust.\n\nSmart investors know that looking at the return of a stock is just one variable when assessing an opportunity. Below, I'm going to dig into what has influenced Micron's price action throughout the year and make the case for why 2025 could be a rebound year for the company.\n\nMicron stock just got smoked\n\nThe chart below illustrates movement in Micron shares throughout 2024. The peaks and valleys depicted in the graph make one thing abundantly clear \u2014 Micron is pretty volatile. In particular, the last six months have been abnormally rocky with shares dropping by about 38% since June.\n\nMy take on what's causing Micron shares to experience so much volatility comes down to one thing: expectations. When businesses such as Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom and many others exhibit robust growth on a consistent basis, investors tend to apply these trends to other companies in the same industry.\n\nAlthough I understand the psychological factors behind these parallels, it's imperative for investors to understand that such a notion is rooted in faulty logic. Not all chip companies manufacture the same products or serve the same purpose, and for that reason, each business is going to experience its own set of unique headwinds and catalysts.\n\nMicron's position in the AI realm focuses on memory and storage applications. Although the company has had impressive top-line growth that's augmented by rising profitability, Micron's forecast for a big miss in its 2025 fiscal second quarter spooked investors.\n\nAgain, I don't necessarily see this as a reason to sell the stock. Below, I'll dig into why Micron's latest plunge is unwarranted.\n\nThe shares could rebound in 2025\n\nSince AI emerged as the world's next megatrend about two years ago, one product in particular has become the technology sector's holy grail: graphic processing units (GPUs).\n\nCompanies such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices develop chipsets known as GPUs that are capable of running complex algorithms at extremely high speeds, and it's this hardware that powers myriad generative AI applications. Taking this a step further, Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures GPUs for Nvidia and AMD while Broadcom supplies a host of network infrastructure equipment needed to power data centers where these GPUs are housed.\n\nWith all of that in mind, doesn't it seem natural that those specific businesses have experienced abnormally high growth during the past two years?\n\nIn my eyes, Micron just hasn't had its moment yet, but I think it's coming. Considering investments in AI infrastructure are expected to be in the trillions of dollars during the next several years, I think it's safe to say that demand for GPUs and data center services isn't going to slow.\n\nAt a more granular level, this means that training and inferencing workloads are going to become more sophisticated and mission critical as competition in the AI arms race intensifies. It's this dynamic that should result in a greater need for memory and storage protocols \u2014 and Micron is extremely well-positioned to capture that demand.\n\nThis isn't just lofty theory, either. Per Micron's 2025 fiscal first quarter (ended Nov. 28), the company's data-center revenue increased by a staggering 400% year over year and reached a record level. Furthermore, the company's data-center segment now accounts for more than 50% of the business. To me, these trends underscore the need for Micron's memory chips and I expect the tailwinds to carry into next year and beyond.\n\nAlthough the company's near-term outlook may not have lived up to expectations, I think the long-term narrative is still very much in focus. According to management, the total addressable market for high bandwidth memory is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030 \u2014 more than six times what it is today. Considering Micron's trailing-12-month revenue is in the ballpark of $29 billion, I think the company has significant upside.\n\nIs Micron stock a buy right now?\n\nValuing Micron is a daunting task. Even though the company generates positive earnings, it has only recently transitioned to a profitable enterprise and so using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio seems a little out of place, in my opinion.\n\nInstead, I'll use the PEG ratio to assess an investment in Micron. The PEG ratio looks at analyst forecasts for earnings growth over several years. If the PEG ratio is less than 1, the stock could be seen as undervalued. Right now, Micron's PEG ratio is just 0.23.\n\nIn my opinion, Micron's low PEG suggests that investors could be overlooking the need for memory and storage chips as AI workloads become larger and more complex. Over time, however, I think the need for Micron's services will become increasingly obvious. To me, buying Micron right now is a bargain opportunity for investors with a long-term time horizon.\n\nAdam Spatacco has positions in Nvidia.

            "date": "19h",
            "source": "The Motley Fool",
            "article_content": "Equity analyst Dan Ives has made a quite a few prescient calls in his career. In the last year alone, he predicted the Nasdaq Composite would hit 20,000, and he remained bullish on Palantir despite widespread skepticism. Lo and behold, the Nasdaq hit 20,000 in 2024, and Palantir was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 index.\n\nThis year, Ives thinks Apple (AAPL -0.20%) and Microsoft (MSFT 1.14%) will become the first $4 trillion companies, as detailed below:\n\nIves recently raised his 12-month target on Apple to $325 per share. That implies about 34% upside from its current share price of $242. If he is correct, Apple would have a market value of $4.9 trillion by year-end in 2025.\n\nIves has set Microsoft with a 12-month target of $550 per share. That implies about 31% upside from its current share price of $419. If he is correct, Microsoft would have a market value just above $4 trillion by year-end in 2025.\n\nHere's what investors should know about Apple and Microsoft.\n\n1. Apple\n\nIn 2024, consultancy Brand Finance ranked Apple as the most valuable brand in the world for the third time in four years. Apple is best known for its premium electronics devices, but the company has also built loyalty through its services business, which includes value-added products like iCloud storage, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+.\n\nApple was slow to respond to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, but the company late last year introduced Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI features available on newer iPad, iPhone, and MacBook models. While the initial response has been somewhat muted in terms of consumer demand, CEO Tim Cook recently told analysts it would usher in a \"new era for the iPhone.\"\n\nDan Ives is equally optimistic. He thinks Apple Intelligence will be the catalyst that drives a massive upgrade cycle. In fact, Ives in a September interview with Schwab Network predicted Apple would record its strongest iPhone unit sales in history in the next year. And more recently, he said the upgrade cycle could drive the company's market value to $5 trillion within 18 months.\n\nApple reported pretty good financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended in September. Revenue rose 6% on mid-single-digit growth in MacBook, iPad, and iPhone sales, and double-digit growth in services. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income climbed 9% to $25 billion, but earnings per share jumped 12% as the company continued to repurchase stock aggressively.\n\nApple Intelligence could certainly be a major catalyst in the coming years, especially given that Apple is the revenue leader in the smartphone market. But management has yet to articulate a long-term strategy that incorporates AI into the services business. Ives says the company will monetize Apple Intelligence with App Store fees as developers build AI into mobile applications. But without some input from management, I find it difficult to be bullish.\n\nAdding to my skepticism, Apple currently trades at 40 times earnings. That is well above the three-year average of 29 times earnings, and the multiple itself is hard to justify when Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 10% annually in the next three years. Dan Ives has an excellent reputation, but I think investors should wait for a better entry point, or else more evidence that Wall Street has grossly underestimated future earnings.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft is the largest software company in the world in terms of revenue. While it is best known for its office productivity tools, the company also has a strong presence in other verticals, including business intelligence, enterprise resource planning, and cybersecurity. Microsoft has introduced generative AI copilots that create new monetization opportunities across its software portfolio.\n\nBeyond software, Microsoft has a strong presence in cloud computing. Its Azure unit is the second-largest cloud infrastructure and platform services provider in terms in terms of sales, and it's well positioned to gain share. Its partnership with OpenAI is a key advantage because it makes Azure the exclusive cloud provider to the AI start-up. That lets Microsoft indirectly monetize ChatGPT usage, and it allows Azure customers to build generative AI applications with OpenAI models.\n\nMicrosoft reported reasonably good financial results in the third quarter. Revenue rose 16% to $65.6 billion on strong sales growth in software, cloud services, and advertising, though its acquisition of Activision added 3 points to top-line growth. But GAAP earnings rose just 10% to $3.30 per diluted share as investments in AI infrastructure weighed on gross margin. The company also gave disappointing guidance, causing shares to slide following the report.\n\nOne reason for the weak guidance is an anticipated $1.5 billion headwind to income in the current quarter due to its share of losses at OpenAI. But that is a temporary problem. Per the terms of the partnership, Microsoft should not only recoup its $13 billion investment in the AI start-up, but will also collect a hefty portion of its earnings once the company reaches profitability. In other words, the headwind should eventually become a tailwind.\n\nThe partnership with OpenAI also creates an onramp to Azure. For instance, usage of Azure OpenAI -- a service that lets developers access OpenAI models -- more than doubled in the past six months. That has contributed to the company's ability to monetize AI, and Microsoft is on pace to earn $10 billion in AI revenue in the next quarter. No product in company history hit that milestone faster, according to CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nWhile the business is solid, Microsoft's valuation is also expensive. The stock trades at 35 times earnings, a premium to the three-year average of 32 times earnings. And the multiple itself is hard to justify when Wall Street expects earnings to grow at 13% annually in the next three years. Again, Ives has an impressive track record where technology stocks are concerned, but I think investors should wait for a better entry point."

They have been visiting the local hot spots of haunted encounters in the area. After investigating, which usually consists of staying a night in the so-called \u201chaunted houses\u201d Sanders then posts videos of the experience on to his Youtube channel, which can be found through the social media handle: CLS Paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have a friend who lives out here and I came out here to visit him. I actually drove from Arizona and he asked me, because he watches my show, if I wanted to do a couple of ghost hunts out here. I was sure that Lockport was rich and full of history, so we did some research and talked to some people and we\u2019ve done quite a few places,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSo far Sander\u2019s visited such spots as Marjim Manor, Van Horn Mansion, Cold Springs Cemetery, Dunkirk Lighthouse and Stooges, the old City Hall.\n\nSanders said he has plans to visit even more ghostly sites, including Graestone Manor in Gasport.\n\nWhile the ghosts in Lockport seem more \u201cintrigued\u201d by him than \u201caggressive\u201d Sanders said that was fine with him. He\u2019s still testing new ground in the world of the paranormal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome of these places I\u2019ve done have never been investigated by anybody before. I think they\u2019re more intrigued here than aggressive, unlike the places I\u2019ve been on the West Coast. Those are used to tourism because some of those places out west are mainstream ghost-hunting places. Here in Lockport, that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders began his own ghost hunting with a curiosity of what\u2019s unknown \u2014 the big questions like, \u201cWhat happens when we die?\u201d \u2014 as well as a drive to find out for himself. There are millions of ghost-hunting shows out there, Sanders said. He wanted to see if it was real.\n\nUsing a wide variety of tools, including \u201cspirit dice,\u201d as well as white noise boxes and light-up \u201crem pods\u201d that he buys online, Sanders said that depending on the intelligence of the ghost he\u2019s trying to communicate with, different kinds of equipment are used.\n\n\u201cYou usually run into a residual haunting or an intelligent haunting and typically an intelligent haunting can give you intelligent conversation through some of the equipment,\u201d he said. \u201cA residual haunting is supposedly a spirit that\u2019s almost stuck in a time loop and the spirit is not able to communicate, but we are able to pick up the presence of spirit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, to even get close to the ghosts, Sanders said he has to get permission. Which can be a strange thing to ask. Such was the case of the old City Hall, now Stooges restaurant.\n\n\u201cI walked through the front door and I could feel the sensation of some sort of activity there and I walked up to the girls who were working at the front counter \u2014 and sometimes it\u2019s a very awkward question to ask about the paranormal \u2014 but I asked them. I said, \u2018I have an odd question for you, is this place haunted?\u2019 They all started laughing,\u201d he said.\n\nAs it turns out, after investigating, there was no \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d of intelligence hauntings in Stooges, but Sanders was able to get evidence of \u201csomething\u201d in the attic.\n\n\u201cWe set a device upstairs in the attic, in which most of the activity, from the employees and the people that have been in there eating, have said they heard. That was the only place I was able to get any concrete evidence of something up there,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther places were a little more spooky, including the house in Cold Springs Cemetery. There, Sanders was unable to get responses, but one of his friends, a camerawoman named Jen Craft, was able to get answers from children who were haunting the second floor.\n\n\u201cShe was getting intelligent responses through the devices we were using, confirming there were children upstairs in the Cold Springs Cemetery house,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSanders said he intends to stay in the area until May and he and his friends will be checking out everything \u201chaunted\u201d in the meantime.\n\n\u201cI will be discussing with the group on dates, holidays and when they\u2019re off (for more ghost hunting trips),\u201d he said."

            "article_content": "It began last June, when a worker at a limestone quarry in southeast England felt \"unusual bumps\" as he was digging up clay.\n\nNow a team of over 100 researchers from the Universities of Birmingham and Oxford have determined that the mysterious bumps found at Dewars Farm Quarry in Oxfordshire were in fact dinosaur tracks dating back to the Middle Jurassic period, around 166 million years ago.\n\nPaleontologists say the some 200 footprints discovered along five different trails offer new insights into certain dinosaurs' size and speed.\n\nUniversity of Birmingham From left: Excavation site researchers Kirsty Edgar, Richard Butler, Duncan Murdock, Alice Roberts and Emma Nicholls\n\n\"All of the dinosaurs, based on our estimates of speed, were probably walking rather than running,\" said Kirsty Edgar, a professor of micropalaeontology at the University of Birmingham who worked on the discovery site.\n\nEdgar told NPR that the environment for the dinosaurs at the time \"was probably lagoonal, probably looked something like the Florida Keys today.\"\n\nResearchers uncovered five trackways buried in the mud, the longest one measuring nearly 500 feet in length. Four of the trackways were made by long-necked herbivorous sauropods, suspected to be the giant 60-foot, two-ton Cetiosaurus, while a fifth set was made by a carnivorous Megalosaurus.\n\nThe Megalosaurus, a ferocious 30-foot-long predator, is famous for its distinctive large three-toed feet with claws. It is also the first dinosaur to ever be scientifically named, in 1824, by Oxford geologist William Buckland. Buckland's unusual fossil discovery kicked off what is now more than 200 years of dinosaur research.\n\nCaroline Wood / University of Oxford The footprint of what is believed to be a Megalosaurus, a carnivorous 30-foot dinosaur known for its distinctive large three-toed feet with claws.\n\nOne area of the excavation site showed the Megalosaurus and sauropod tracks crossing over, raising additional questions about how and if the two species interacted.\n\n\"Scientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,\" said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist at Oxford Museum of Natural History.\n\nEach Megalosaurus track was around 25 inches long, with a stride of about 8.8 feet. Based on those measurements, scientists estimate the dinosaur walked at a pace of around 3 miles per hour, similar to an average adult human walking speed. They believe the sauropods walked at a similar pace.\n\nTracks were first discovered in the area in 1997, when limestone quarry workers stumbled upon more than 40 sets of dinosaur footprints, with some trackways reaching up to nearly 600 feet in length. The British government named the Oxfordshire site as one of the most important dinosaur track sites in the world, with the discovery providing major pieces of evidence about the species of dinosaurs that roamed the U.K. during the Middle Jurassic Period.\n\nDuring the latest excavation, researchers captured more than 20,000 images of the 200 footprints.\n\nCopyright 2025 NPR"

            "article_content": "The next big thing\n\nWe all know about large language models (LLMs) that are facilitating computers to generate and process big data, enabling them to respond to natural language questions. But now, small language models (SLMs), which have the capability to generate human-like language and are trained on datasets that are limited, are also becoming all the rage. It is understood that they can be trained and used easily, besides being more cost-effective and using less computational power, making them ideal for specific tasks. Big tech giants Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon and others are investing billions in developing general-purpose LLMs to handle a variety of tasks, but they might not be able to be customised for certain needs. They may require a smaller version of generative AI. Infosys chief technology officer Mohammed Rafee Tarafdar was recently quoted as saying that several small language models for India-specific needs have already been launched and with a growing developer base, a lot more GenAI applications will be implemented for Indian and global markets. Last year saw several launches of lightweight models such as Microsoft\u2019s Phi family of SLMs, Google\u2019s Gemma and a smaller variant of Meta\u2019s Llama model. Microsoft\u2019s Sundar Srinivasan was also quoted as saying that while LLMs have pushed the boundaries of accuracy across various AI tasks throughout 2024, SLMs have driven mass adoption and true democratisation of AI. Industry experts are certainly looking at SLMs as the next big thing in AI.\n\nA godfather\u2019s warning\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, a British-Canadian computer scientist who is referred to as the \u2018godfather\u2019 of AI, has raised an alarm that the technology may lead to human extinction in the next 30 years, with a 10-20% chance of that happening. Hinton was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics earlier in 2024 for his contributions to AI. In an interview to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he was quoted as saying that we\u2019ve never had to deal with things more intelligent than ourselves before discussing his evolving views on AI\u2019s potential risks. He says that the likelihood of AI causing harm has risen in recent times. \u201cAnd how many examples do you know of a more intelligent thing being controlled by a less intelligent thing? There are very few examples. There\u2019s a mother and baby. Evolution put a lot of work into allowing the baby to control the mother, but that\u2019s about the only example I know of,\u201d he had said conceding on a previous account that he wished he\u2019d thought about safety earlier \u2013 alluding to his apprehension about the potential for AI to ramp up the arms race. Hinton has been speaking about the potential dangers of unregulated AI development after he resigned from Google in 2023. He made headlines when he left Google and raised alarms of the repercussions of machines such as AI that could one day outsmart people, adding that there is also the possibility of some bad actors exploiting AI for destructive purposes.\n\nGemini vs OpenAI\n\nThe rivalry between Google\u2019s Gemini and Microsoft-backed OpenAI has been escalating. According to reports, Google is set to build business and focus on Gemini AI for customers in 2025, amidst rivalry with OpenAI. As reported, its contractors are using an internal platform for comparing Gemini\u2019s outputs to those of other AI models and are relying on Claude, a family of large language models developed by Anthropic, to improve the responses provided by its own AI model. TechCrunch reported that Google contractors are given responses generated by Gemini and Claude in response to a user prompt which they have to rate within 30 minutes on factors such as truthfulness and verbosity. Meanwhile, Google recently unveiled the Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental model in competition with OpenAI. In its blog, Google said that it is their \u201cmost capable model yet\u201d. \u201cWith new advances in multimodality \u2014 like native image and audio output \u2014 and native tool use, it will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant,\u201d Google said. Additionally, it launched a new feature called \u2018Deep Research\u2019, which is capable of using \u201cadvanced reasoning and long context capabilities to act as a research assistant, exploring complex topics and compiling reports\u201d, available for Gemini\u2019s advanced subscribers.\n\nAlso Read Volkswagen Golf GTI to launch in India next year Zelio Ebikes launches e-rickshaws Tanga Butterfly and Tanga SS starting at Rs 1.40 lakh Kotak Mahindra Bank\u2019s COO & CTO steps down Building rural resilience\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI, too, has unveiled new o3 and o3 mini models, which will be launched later this year. The new models are quite advanced versions and much better than its predecessors in several performance benchmarks, as per reports.\n\nAI in Mahakumbh\n\nAs AI is increasingly becoming pervasive, why should Mahakumbh be left behind? In line with the advancing tech, the Uttar Pradesh government has planned to use AI-enabled cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID) wristbands and mobile app tracking to track the headcount of pilgrims at the upcoming religious carnival. Starting in Prayagraj on January 13, approximately 450 million devotees are likely to attend Mahakumbh, which is recognised by UNESCO as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The government will also launch a dedicated website and app, an AI-powered chatbot in 11 languages, QR code-based passes for people and vehicles, and a multilingual digital lost-and-found centre for visitors."

            "article_content": "Headquartered in San Francisco in the United States, artificial intelligence research organisation OpenAI has consistently stayed in the news in the past few years. Be it coming out with the internet\u2019s much-loved ChatGPT in 2022, the whole investors board vs CEO Sam Altman drama in 2023, or now, the news that it might be getting back into the humanoid robots space. We say \u2018getting back\u2019 because for the longest time OpenAI did have a dedicated robotics team, which it had to shut down three years ago, due to \u201cinsufficient training data\u201d, the company\u2019s co-founder Wojciech Zaremba, who also used to head the team, revealed in a podcast interview at the time. In an interesting turn of events, on December 24 last year, The Information, a US-based tech/ business publication, quoted \u201ctwo people with direct knowledge\u201d on the subject saying that OpenAI has been exploring building a humanoid robot.\n\nA humanoid robot has physical features similar to humans in skeletal form \u2014 arms, legs, head, etc, and is trained to do human-like tasks, ranging from simple to extremely complex too.\n\nIn the meantime\n\nWith OpenAI returning to the terrain, it might be looking at exciting developments coming up. But the company wasn\u2019t never really too far from the robotics space. Even after shutting down the robotic division, OpenAI does seem to have been invested in the field, quite literally. In February this year, OpenAI Startup Fund along with Microsoft, Bezos Expeditions, Parkway Venture Capital, ARK Invest, Intel Capital, Nvidia, and Align Ventures, invested in Figure AI, a US-based startup that has been trying to \u201cbring a general purpose humanoid to life\u201d.\n\nAlso Read SEBI tightens SME listing regulations Superman takes flight again: James Gunn reimagines the Man of Steel for a new DC Universe BSNL may turn profitable in FY27, projected to post Rs 558-crore profit Import of oil from Russia falls 13 per cent in December\n\nPeter Welinder, VP of product and partnerships at OpenAI, had told the media, \u201cWe\u2019ve always planned to come back to robotics and we see a path with Figure to explore what humanoid robots can achieve when powered by highly capable multimodal models.\u201d\n\nThe company also invested in 1X Technologies, \u201can AI robotics company producing humanoids capable of human-like movements and behaviours\u201d, according to its website, to help them integrate GPT AI models with robotic systems. In November this year, OpenAI invested in another AI and robotics-centred start-up called Physical Intelligence.\n\nNot just that, reportedly at the beginning of 2024, OpenAI also was looking to hire people who specialised in robotics, suggesting that it might be looking to rebuild its OG team.\n\nEndless possibilities\n\nRecently, humanoid robots have been employed to test AI capabilities in workspaces, warehouses, other physical spaces, etc. At the moment, the big players in the humanoid robotics field are Boston Dynamics, Tesla Optimus, Sanctuary AI, Xiaomi\u2019s CyberOne, and Agility Robotics, among others.\n\nWith OpenAI re-entering the field, the possibilities are endless on what the future developments could look like. However, it\u2019s noteworthy that The Information\u2019s report didn\u2019t conclusively say whether robotics is a high-priority matter for OpenAI or not.\n\nNevertheless, with the company\u2019s recent launches such as o3 AI models, the developers might be on the path to create robots that could perform complicated tasks, respond to humans, initiate problem solving, and be deployed in different industries, considering that the company\u2019s latest AI models have been developed with advanced reasoning capabilities. Going ahead, these robots (if powered with features that are adaptable and the robots made accessible) could revolutionise industries like healthcare, manufacturing, hospitality, and perhaps even caregiving."

As traders grapple with this bearish trend, many are turning their attention to innovative alternatives that promise safer returns.\n\nAmong these alternatives, RCO Finance (RCOF), an upcoming AI altcoin, is emerging as an option of hope for investors seeking stability and significant returns from the previous losses from the Ethereum price drop.\n\nEthereum Price Faces Extended Losses Below Key Support Levels\n\nThe Ethereum price has continued, plunging below the critical $3,550 threshold and sparking investor concerns. The altcoin has not regained momentum, trading well below $3,500, with bearish resistance at $3,420 on the hourly ETH/USD chart.\n\nThis downward trajectory has intensified, with the coin touching intraday lows near $3,100 and consolidating losses around $3,300.\n\nThe Ethereum price trading below its 100-hour Simple Moving Average reinforces the bearish sentiment, indicating a clear lack of upward pressure. Key resistance levels remain at $3,350 and $3,420, with support zones at $3,120 and $3,050.\n\nA breach below $3,050 could push the Ethereum price into uncharted bearish territory, potentially testing the $2,880 level.\n\nAs Ethereum struggles to recover, traders are eyeing alternative investment opportunities like RCO Finance (RCOF), an AI altcoin with the potential to deliver more stable and lucrative returns in a volatile market.\n\nRCO Finance (RCOF): The RIsing DeFi Gem\n\nIn response to the Ethereum price volatility, investors are turning their attention to AI altcoins, like RCO Finance (RCOF), which integrate artificial intelligence to improve financial services and investment strategies.

They found a spurt of flight activity every time warm fronts were present.\n\nWarm storm fronts are travelling masses of warm air which occur right before a storm or before rain.\n\nNew Delhi: A new study has uncovered the migration strategy of a mammal species called common noctule bat, which travels thousands of kilometres every spring across Europe. Published Thursday in the journal Science , the study finds that these bats use warm storm fronts to aid their migration and conserve energy while flying.\n\nThe study marks the first time migratory activity of noctule bats is being observed carefully, since migration is largely believed to be the forte of birds.\n\nFree and Fair Journalism Will Continue to be Important in 2025 You are crucial in ensuring that independent journalism thrives. Support us in delivering unbiased, in-depth stories that matter. Contribute Now\n\nHowever, by studying bat behaviour, these scientists found some new information such as the fact that some of them travel up to 400 km in one night.\n\nSurprisingly, noctule bats neither eat too much nor gain too much weight before migration.\n\nInstead, they follow a hopping pattern with lots of stops in between to keep eating throughout their journey.\n\nAlso Read: 2024 Physics Nobel for AI scientists. How they pioneered machine learning modelled on human brain\n\nMoon had a weak magnetic field up until 2 bn years ago\n\nChinese scientists have found evidence that the Moon had a weak magnetic field up until two billion years ago.\n\nThis is a significant discovery for researchers trying to understand the lunar dynamo, a process by which the magnetic field of the Moon came into being and then slowly faded, which is still a mystery.\n\nAs part of the study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, the scientists used samples collected from China\u2019s Chang\u2019e 5 mission.\n\nMagnetisation tests revealed that two billion years ago, these rocks had a magnetic field with an intensity of two to four microtesla which, though weak, served as evidence of the presence of a magnetic field. One of the theories posited by the scientists is that thermal convection or the movement of rocks and materials inside the Moon could have kept the magnetic field active.\n\nIn last ice age, wildfires increased during abrupt climate change periods\n\nAbrupt periods of climate change during the last ice age or glacial period\u2014which began about 100,000 years ago and lasted until about 25,000 years ago\u2014coincided with increased wildfires, a new study has found.\n\nThe finding was made as a result of scientists studying sources of ancient gas bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice.\n\nThe study was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\nPrevious research has shown that the last ice age had certain periods of abrupt increase in climate change phenomena characterised by abnormal temperature rises and changing rainfall patterns. During such periods, there was also an increase in methane levels, as revealed by the presence of bubbles of the greenhouse gas trapped in Antarctic ice.\n\nThe reason behind this, however, was not known. Until now.\n\nAnalysis of ancient methane bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice using a mass spectrometer by US and Swiss scientists has shown that global forest fires may have resulted in the rise in atmospheric methane in the last ice age.\n\nThe study is the first to explain spikes in methane during the last glacial period, and indicates a better understanding of the cycles of climate change in the past.\n\nWhy most cancers spread to lungs\n\nBelgian scientists have found a reason behind why lungs are a frequent target for cancer metastasis or the spread of cancer cells. More than half of cancer patients see their tumours spread beyond the primary site into the lungs, a condition known as lung metastasis.\n\nThe reason, according to a new paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, is the existence of aspartate in the lungs, an amino acid that allows easier translation (process in which cells use messenger RNA to create proteins) of cancer cells in the lungs as opposed to other parts of the body.\n\nAspartate is present in large amounts in the lungs and triggers a certain protein receptor in cancer cells, allowing them to grow aggressively by providing a more suitable environment.\n\nThe significance of the discovery is that scientists can now look for drugs and therapies that will target this translation process of cancer cells in lungs with the aim of reducing lung metastasis.\n\n(Edited by Radifah Kabir)\n\nAlso Read: US biologists win Nobel in Medicine for microRNA discovery.

            "article_content": "Luiz Rocha was scuba diving 460 feet beneath the surface of the Indian Ocean when a flash caught his eye: a small damselfish with big eyes, perched on a colorful reef.\n\nRocha, a scientist and curator at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, thought the fish was so unusual that it might actually be an undiscovered species. Two years later, he was able to confirm his suspicions with a team of researchers, and described his find in a paper published last month.\n\nThe damselfish, officially Chromis abadhah, is one of 138 animals, fungi and plants from around the world that Academy of Sciences researchers confirmed as new discoveries in 2024. They include 31 other fishes, dozens of bugs, an endangered dahlia, two deep-water ghost sharks, and a striped spider from Madagascar. The Academy is just one of many institutions globally that document new species.\n\nThese new-to-science specimens were spotted by scientists like Rocha in their habitats on several continents and in the waters around them and confirmed in a long, scientific process called \u201cdescription.\u201d\n\nScientists who discover new species have the honor of naming them. This year\u2019s list includes a \u201cplant bug\u201d named after outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris: Pseudoloxops kamalaharrisae, a yellow creature with long antennae found in French Polynesia. Another bug was named for actor Harrison Ford. Academy researcher Brad Balukjian, who co-discovered both, said in a news release that he wanted to honor the politician\u2019s and celebrity\u2019s commitments to conservation and climate science.\n\nShannon Bennett, a virologist and chief of science at the Academy, said the discoveries speak to humanity\u2019s responsibility to catalog and conserve Earth\u2019s rich biodiversity. Species are being snuffed out because of human activity at a terrifying rate \u2014 so fast that scientists call this era a \u201cmass extinction,\u201d like the asteroid that took out dinosaurs 66 million years ago.\n\n\u201cYou cannot care about what you don\u2019t know about,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nScientists estimate that they\u2019ve discovered just one-tenth of the planet\u2019s species, Bennett said. Typically, researchers come across new creatures while examining something else. That\u2019s how Rocha came across the sleek damselfish two years ago.\n\nAn expert in deep-water scuba diving, Rocha trekked to the Maldives, a tiny island country in the Indian Ocean, to survey its deep reefs.\n\nThese colorful bands of coral lie at depths between 100 feet and 500 feet and, like many of the world\u2019s deep reefs, had never been seen by humans, Rocha said.\n\nWater filters enough light at that depth that divers call it the \u201ctwilight zone.\u201d But the distinctive damselfish, white-and-blue hued with elegant fins, caught Rocha\u2019s eye.\n\nRocha snapped a photo and returned the next day. Because the fish were abundant, he collected four specimens for later study. It was a long journey, and the fish did not survive. Rocha could only spend eight minutes at that depth to save enough time for a four-hour ascent to the surface, rising slowly to avoid a dangerous buildup of gases known as \u201cthe bends.\u201d\n\nRocha had a hunch that the species was new to science but needed confirmation. What followed was a lengthy process, in which he and a team of Academy researchers studied the fish\u2019s traits and compared them to others. The results were published in the peer-reviewed journal ZooKeys.\n\nTo name the fish, Rocha collaborated with Maldivian locals and settled on a name in a local tongue: \u201cabadhah,\u201d which translates as \u201cperpetual.\u201d Rocha wants the species and its colorful habitat to be everlasting, he said, and he hopes the name will inspire conservation efforts. Even though humans had never before laid eyes on the deep reef where he found the damselfish, the signs of over-fishing, plastics and pollution were obvious, Rocha said.\n\nOther water-dwelling animals confirmed as new discoveries this year include a goby found in Bali, Indonesia, that resides in giant sponges; a slew of marine worms; eerie ghost sharks that live at deep depths; and a tiny pipehorse the size of a golf tee found in South Africa.\n\nOn land, the discoveries include a brilliantly colored dahlia in the Mexican state of Oaxaca that\u2019s critically endangered \u2014 a rare distinction \u2014 and a 100-million-year-old fossil of a skink \u2014 a kind of lizard \u2014 that was preserved in amber in Myanmar.\n\nBennett said that the rate of confirmations this year is about average. She expects \u201cmany, many more\u201d in 2025."

Just tap the + button or paste the image into the entry bar,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new update puts Grok on par with other industry-leading AI tools, including OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 3 (which uses ChatGPT for image generation), Meta\u2019s AI assistant (available on WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, offering text and image generation), and Google\u2019s Gemini 2.0 (capable of generating images, audio, and text).\n\nxAI previously tested the waters with image generation by introducing a tool called \u201cAurora\u201d within Grok in November 2024, however, the feature was removed after its brief launch.\n\nSince its debut in November 2023, Grok has seen rapid growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially exclusive to X premium users, the AI assistant became available to non-premium users in December 2024 with some restrictions.\n\nFree users are now able to make up to 10 queries every two hours, along with access to limited image analysis features, while premium and premium+ subscribers enjoy increased access, including up to 50 daily queries.\n\nIn November 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported that Grok\u2019s valuation reached $50 billion, while Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s chief executive officer (CEO), described Musk\u2019s chatbot as a \u201cserious competitor\u201d a month later."

            "article_content": "A recent article in the journal Nature described the new Google-backed artificial intelligence tool GenCast, which can significantly outperform conventional weather forecasting \u2014 with implications for saving money and lives by improving preparations for extreme weather.\n\nAnnounced in early December, GenCast is a machine-learning model that boasts \"better forecasts of both day-to-day weather and extreme events\" than existing systems.\n\nThe technology, developed by the Google-owned company DeepMind, based in London, improves forecasting accuracy for up to 15 days into the future \u2014 a time frame that traditional models have found problematic.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's a big deal,\" Kerry Emanuel, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor emeritus, told The New York Times.\n\nThe newspaper explained that Emanuel and colleagues argued in 2019 that extending the time for reliable forecasts from 10 days to 15 days could help people avoid the worst of extreme weather and reap \"enormous socioeconomic benefits.\"\n\nAs the Times detailed, the \"chaotic nature of Earth's atmosphere\" has historically put limits on how far into the future forecasters can peer accurately. GenCast achieved higher accuracy in tests using historical data against a current standard-bearer, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.\n\nAccording to the Times, the new model also \"ran circles\" around its DeepMind predecessor, released in late 2023. \"It's like we've made decades worth of improvements in one year,\" R\u00e9mi Lam, who worked on both models, said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother improvement: GenCast is a \"probabilistic\" model rather than a \"deterministic\" one \u2014 meaning that it gives probabilities for outcomes rather than just yes/no predictions. This is the difference between a forecast with a percent chance of precipitation and a forecast that simply gives a best guess of whether it will rain at a particular time and place.\n\nGenCast can also use smaller computers and produce results faster than conventional forecasting methods. Yet it still relies on traditional meteorology. The new tool uses AI's ability to pick out patterns from data and create something new, but it's anchored by 40 years of real-world data and current-day measurements, the Times reported.\n\nLam pointed out how this makes GenCast's results less susceptible to some fallacies of other AI products that train on the internet's chaos of facts and fictions. \"We have a ground truth,\" Lam told the Times.\n\nAmong other concerns, AI has been criticized for its massive energy needs. This is particularly a problem if the energy comes from sources that release heat-trapping gases that in turn cause planetary warming and amplify extreme weather.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, DeepMind has argued that its application of the technology will help people deal with the consequences of changing weather patterns.\n\n\"Weather impacts all of us,\" GenCast's announcement stated. \"As climate change drives more extreme weather events, accurate and trustworthy forecasts are more essential than ever.\"\n\n\"... Consider tropical cyclones, also known as hurricanes and typhoons. Getting better and more advanced warnings of where they'll strike land is invaluable.\"\n\nThe DeepMind researchers highlighted how GenCast could also help the field of clean energy, such as by better predicting the reliability of wind power.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith DeepMind opening its models to the public, the world may not need to wait long for it to have influence.\n\nForecasters are interested in using the model. Matthew Chantry, a machine learning coordinator at ECMWF, told the Times that his center was already incorporating aspects of the tech.\n\n\"We are eager to engage with the wider weather community,\" two of DeepMind's lead researchers wrote in their blog. They acknowledged that such collaborations \"are critical to our mission to apply our models to benefit humanity.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet."

            "source": "The Daily Star",
            "article_content": "Despite some episodic spikes here and there, the economy of Bangladesh is still struggling, and the government isn't sure what the top priority should be. Businesses are under pressure as inflation rises beyond 9 percent and GDP growth slows to 5.2 percent in FY24 with further downward trend.\n\nAs we know, family-run and promoter-led firms dominate the Bangladesh economy, especially in the textile, export and manufacturing industries. Nearly 4 million people work in the readymade garment industry alone. Many company leaders/owners have been put behind bars or are absconding due to recent upheavals, which have interrupted operations and made decision-making more time-consuming. Further degradation will cause closures, pay reductions, and rapid layoffs.\n\nIn response to similar problems, nations like Vietnam and India offered financial aid and tax breaks to save domestic companies. But Bangladesh rather eliminated incentives and reportedly raising taxes, which may make recovery far more challenging.\n\nWhat's at stake if large companies fail?\n\nThe collapse of large companies would shock Bangladesh's job market. Over 80 percent of formal occupations are directly or indirectly related to these companies. Layoffs will cause families to experience immediate financial instability and income loss.\n\nNot only the manufacturing industry but also transporters, raw material suppliers, port personnel, and logistics providers would all see a sharp drop in business, which would result in a large number of job losses. The loss of jobs in the unorganised sector, which is heavily reliant on the spending power of those in corporate occupations, would make poverty worse.\n\nThe economy as a whole will suffer from a deteriorating labour market. As incomes decline, consumer spending will also decline, which will force more businesses to shut down or scale back operations. There will be more protests and strikes, which will lead to higher unemployment rates and more instability in society. Similar periods of political and economic instability have been experienced by nations like Pakistan and Sri Lanka as a result of delayed interventions. Bangladesh is unable to afford to take the same path.\n\nWhat the government must do now\n\nLarge companies and promoters need immediate breathing space to survive. The government must step in with low-interest loans, deferred taxes, and grace periods for repayments. Vietnam saved thousands of businesses this way. Bangladesh must act similarly to prevent layoffs and closures. Investment incentives must also be restored to attract capital and revive confidence in economic zones that are now stagnant.\n\nThe workforce needs skill development badly. Mismatched skills keep 40 percent of graduates unemployed. The 'Skill India' mission trained millions and increased employment. Bangladesh must duplicate such initiatives to prepare its workers.\n\nReviving clothing export orders necessitates careful attention. Simplifying trade regulations, offering export incentives, and lowering transportation costs can all help. Vietnam invested $1.2 billion in textiles to compete; Bangladesh must do the same or risk falling behind.\n\nEqually important is simplifying regulations. Endless red tape slows corporate growth and hiring. To grow and stabilise employment, the government must streamline processes.\n\nA last chance to act\n\nBangladesh's large companies don't just create jobs -- they sustain entire ecosystems. If these companies collapse, millions of jobs will vanish, poverty rates will spike, and social unrest will escalate. Countries like Vietnam and India acted fast to prevent such outcomes with bold interventions. Bangladesh, however, risks falling further behind if it continues to delay action.\n\nThe time for hesitation is over. The government must step up with financial support, regulatory reforms, and investment incentives to protect jobs and stabilise corporations. Employment must be prioritised to prevent economic disaster and ensure Bangladesh's long-term recovery. Reconstituting boards or temporarily releasing funds to ailing banks would not help. Business continuity, including corporate and large loan restructuring for distressed companies, is key here. Policy makers need to think beyond and act sensibly.\n\nThe author is chairman of Financial Excellence Ltd"

            "article_content": "Serving tech enthusiasts for over 25 years.TechSpot means tech analysis and advice you can trust\n\nSomething to look forward to: Since AMD introduced its Ryzen 9000 series and Strix Point Ryzen AI processors, users have been eagerly anticipating other members of the Zen 5 family, such as Ryzen AI Max and Fire Range. Now, ECS has become the first manufacturer to confirm plans to unveil a product featuring AMD's mainstream-focused Krackan Point chips at CES 2025.\n\nECS is set to showcase the first laptop featuring AMD's upcoming Krackan Point APUs at CES 2025. AMD has already confirmed that Krackan Point is designed to offer a low-cost entry point into Microsoft's Copilot+ PC standard, positioning it to compete with Intel's Lunar Lake Core Ultra 200V series.\n\nThe processor powering the ECS UP42KP laptop is likely the Ryzen AI 7 350. The manufacturer's description matches the rumored specifications of this chip, which include four Zen 5 cores, four Zen 5c cores, an integrated GPU with eight RDNA 3.5 compute units, and an XDNA 2 NPU capable of 40 TOPs \u2013 meeting the threshold required for Copilot.\n\nWith a TDP ranging from 15W to 54W, the 14-inch 1080p laptop supports DDR5-5600 RAM, 16 PCIe lanes, Wi-Fi 6, HDMI 2.1, and USB 4. It also supports Windows Hello via an IR camera with a privacy shutter. While the release date and pricing details remain unclear, AMD aims for Krackan Point devices to retail for under $800.\n\nThe Ryzen AI 7 350 is the most powerful Krackan Point APU announced so far, but a lower-tier version \u2013 the AI 5 340 \u2013 was spotted on Geekbench last November. This cheaper variant will maintain the AI 7 350's NPU performance but feature three Zen 5 cores, three Zen 5c cores, and a Radeon 840M iGPU with four RDNA 3.5 CUs.\n\nKrackan Point sits just below Strix Point in AMD's Zen 5 lineup. Since its debut late last year, Strix Point APUs, such as the Ryzen AI 9 HX 375, have started appearing in the latest handheld gaming PCs. Lenovo is expected to unveil a device featuring the Z2 Extreme variant at CES.\n\nRyzen AI Max, featuring up to 16 Zen 5 cores and 40 RDNA 3.5 CUs, is the next step up. A benchmark of an engineering sample was recently spotted running on an upcoming high-end 2-in-1 notebook from Asus.\n\nUsers are also eagerly awaiting the launch of AMD's Fire Range, the company's most powerful Zen 5 laptop processors. A recent Geekbench AI test suggests they will debut in Asus' 2025 ROG Strix G-series laptops.\n\nIn the desktop sector, AMD is also set to unveil new Ryzen 9000 X3D CPUs this month. TechSpot recently named last year's 9800X3D the best gaming CPU, and it has outpaced all of its non-X3D counterparts in sales at Mindfactory.\n\nThe new ECS Krackan Point laptop will be accompanied by a new Snapdragon X Plus notebook, a mini PC, and new Intel motherboards."

            "article_content": "Krishna specializes in designing and implementing hybrid cloud architectures for highly regulated sectors, such as the healthcare industry.\n\nGopi Krishna\n\nIntegration design becomes a key component of innovation in the fast-paced field of information technology, where systems need to communicate with each other and data flows need to be optimized. Through this discipline, organizations can solve complex problems, improve operational efficiency, and satisfy constantly changing business demands by bridging the gap between disparate systems. A strategic enabler that propels innovation by coordinating technological solutions with organizational objectives, integration architecture is more than just a technical framework. For Gopi Krishna, a specialist in cloud architectures and middleware solutions, this field offers a special nexus of strategic vision and technical precision. Krishna has a career that includes notable accomplishments in sectors like healthcare and logistics. His journey highlights the transformative power of careful integration architecture in resolving challenging IT issues.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKrishna specializes in designing and implementing hybrid cloud architectures for highly regulated sectors, such as the healthcare industry. The two requirements of cost-effectiveness and compliance in this field demand solutions that strike a balance between strict data security and operational scalability. This equilibrium is best demonstrated by Krishna's work, especially in the way he incorporates cutting-edge encryption techniques, safe access controls, and compliance with laws like HIPAA. By taking these precautions, sensitive medical data was protected, and the solutions were scalable to accommodate future organizational requirements.\n\nIn the same way, his contributions to the logistics industry emphasize how important integration architecture is to supply chain optimization. Through the integration of cloud platforms and on-premise systems, Krishna created robust infrastructures that improved the accessibility of real-time data. The effectiveness of order processing and delivery systems was greatly increased by this work, illustrating the direct influence that strong middleware solutions can have on organizational performance.\n\nThe progression of Krishna's career from engineer to middleware architect highlights his dedication to lifelong learning and flexibility. Having earned certifications from AWS and Oracle, he has continuously kept up with the latest developments in technology. Projects like improving the backbone for telecom operators, redesigning the middleware architecture of TelePacific Systems, and developing a unified IT platform for the City of Tshwane in South Africa are just a few examples of his technical proficiency. Krishna's ability to use creative IT solutions to address intricate, systemic inefficiencies is demonstrated by the latter, a massive project to digitize and integrate government operations.\n\nIn his current role, Krishna has produced quantifiable effects at the organizational level. For example, his efforts in internal application security have doubled the system's order handling capacity, resulting in 50% shorter processing times and a 100% increase in transaction rates. Improved service delivery and cost savings are directly correlated with this efficiency. Likewise, his hybrid cloud designs for medical devices guaranteed adherence to international regulatory standards while protecting against data breaches.\n\nHowever, Krishna's career has been fraught with difficulties. For example, integrating legacy systems with contemporary platforms necessitated creative approaches to data processing and security. He maintained their relevance in an age of rapid technological advancement by ensuring smooth communication across disparate systems through the use of tools like RESTful services and API gateways.\n\nThe significance of proactive planning and resilience in IT architecture is highlighted by Krishna's predictions about future trends. He promotes integrating modern technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to improve operational dependability and security. Moreover, his emphasis on continuous training for IT professionals reflects his recognition of the dynamic nature of security threats and compliance requirements.\n\nReflecting on his experience, Krishna asserts, \u201cIn IT architecture, the key to solving tomorrow\u2019s challenges lies in anticipating them today. Innovation is not just about adopting the latest technologies but designing systems that are secure, adaptable, and prepared for the unexpected. This idea acts as a compass for businesses attempting to negotiate the intricacies of integration architecture in a digital environment that is changing quickly.\n\nKrishna has shown through his work that innovation and successfully tackling IT challenges depend heavily on careful design and strategic foresight. As industries continue to change, experts like him establish the benchmark for excellence in integration architecture, helping businesses to accomplish their strategic and operational goals."

He found him lying on the floor insensible. He picked him up and found that he had butted his head against the wall and fractured his skull. Drs. Guien and Lee examined the poor man and found a fracture of the skull so pronounced as to require trepanning. The patient will be allowed to rest a few days to see how the case develops.\n\n70 Years Ago\n\nCloud seeding: Gov. Charles Russell signed a contract for Nevada\u2019s first cloud seeding program. The agreement is between the Nevada State Cloud Seeding Committee and the Water Resources Development Corp. of Denver.

On leaving Carson the outfit consisted of mining tools, bedding, and grub all piled into a \u201csooner\u201d wagon. Traveling with me was Sherdie Mayfield and Albert, the flying Dutchman. First night \u2014 we camped and Albert, being the cook, picked up a hot skillet, and dropped it on a pot of boiling coffee into his unlaced shoes. After he had both feet rolled up in gunnysacks and oil, supper commenced.\n\nWe left Carson about noon. I rode my \u201cBlack Pant.\u201d In front of the Ormsby we stopped and bid all friends goodbye. We started southward to Arizona and ended at Bodie. Albert burnt his hands at every meal, and Sherdie burnt the beans. My horse ran away, and it was four days after I caught him, he nearly kicked me to death.

I was covered with blood and dust. Bodie\u2019s busy population was pushing and plodding, and its great mines and mills have a glorious future. After being fixed up in liniment and splints, the doctor and myself went into a saloon. As I entered the sidewalk, I met a jubilant man from Bodie who yelled as he grasped my hand, \u201cWhoa, old son, shake; put \u2018er here; \u2026 this is a bully town, 10 funerals today and a man just fell down the Bulwer shaft for a starter.

It was under the auspices of Mrs. Bowers and her lady friends. It was a very elegant affair and a greater part of the elite of Washoe County were there. The admission fee of $5 was charged to the invited guests and gentlemen. All the administration of the affairs of the ball was in the hands of the ladies. This was a great ball, and as high-toned as it was peculiar.\n\n140 Years Ago\n\nHank Monk astonished: Charley Parkhurst, a well-known stage driver on the coast and one of the acknowledged crack whips, died near Watsonville. When the remains were being laid out the astounding discovery was made that Parkhurst was a woman. She had been known on the coast for 25 years, and the most astonishing part of the business is that she could have kept the secret so long. Parkhurst used to be with Hank Monk a good deal in the early days and when Hank heard the report, he gasped for breath and drawled out: \u201cJe-hosiphat. I camped out with Parkie once for over a week, and we slept on the same buffalo robe right along. Wonder if Curley Bill\u2019s been playin\u2019 me the same way.\u201d\n\n130 Years Ago\n\nSocial gossip: A party of 15 people drove down the prison road in a mysterious manner to catch the Culloughs napping; it was a surprise party. The sleighs drew up in front of the prison and a broad sheet of light from the doors and windows shown out across the glistening snow. Mr. and Mrs. Cullough stood waiting on the steps to receive their guests. A moment of truth flashed upon the sleigh riders \u2014 that they were the only ones surprised.

The 2nd to last one drifted slighting then disappeared. They maintained that formation for the duration of the sighting,' the user said.\n\nBright orange 'UGO orbs' were allegedly caught flying over New York City ,' stumping raising concern among locals\n\nThe traveler recorded the video above Brookville Blvd in Queens, New York, right next to JFK airport\n\nUsers local to the New York City area also confirmed the traveler's sightings. One, who goes by the username @ZoraOctavia, said they have lived by the airport for over a decade and know the difference between a plane and a UFO.\n\n'Lived here 14 years with planes flying by all day everyday. They fly so low it feels like you can almost touch them. I know what they look like when they come in to land and take off. I have never ever seen anything like this. Ever,' the user said.\n\nOther Redditors deemed the occurrence as highly suspicious and were shocked the government wasn't taking immediate action.\n\n'Seeing as that's a no fly zone, the FAA should be all over that,' said a user.\n\n'This is truly not okay. Can we please start demanding the government gives more a f*** about this?' chimed a third.\n\nRecent reports of strange orbs in the skies above the eastern United States have added another layer of mystery to the ongoing drone sightings across the country.\n\nA father and son in Georgia experienced an unusual encounter on December 26 when they spotted a bright orange 'UFO orb' moving across the night sky.\n\nWhile taking out the trash, the father noticed the glowing object and pointed it out to his son.\n\nA father and son in Georgia followed a mysterious 'orange UFO orb' after they spotted the luminous hue gliding through the sky shortly after 6:30pm on Thursday evening\n\nEarlier this week, another perplexing light was captured hovering over the skies of New Jersey\n\nIntrigued, they watched the orb for several minutes before deciding to film it.\n\nThe father then shared the video on the 'UFO Reddit' forum, seeking explanations for the mysterious phenomenon.\n\nThe 58-second video shows the orange orb gliding through the sky, occasionally moving upward or downward.\n\nAs the father followed it, the orb appeared to dim and eventually vanish, leaving him and his son puzzled about its nature.\n\nThe father described the initial sighting as a 'huge' light in the distance, which seemed to dim as it approached. He speculated that the orb might have been trying to evade him, or it could have simply disappeared behind clouds.\n\nThe video has since garnered significant attention on Reddit, with over 2,000 shares and 500 comments from users discussing the unusual sighting.\n\nJust days prior, a perplexing light was captured hovering over New Jersey skies.\n\nVideo footage from near Atlantic City shows a white light blinking before suddenly accelerating away at incredible speeds, leaving observers stunned.\n\nThese recent events follow a report from a US military witness who experienced a close encounter with a silent, luminous object while camping in October.\n\nThe witness described the object as hovering 100 yards above, illuminating the area brighter than any full moon.\n\nThese sightings, along with others reported to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), continue to fuel public interest and speculation about the nature of these unidentified aerial phenomena."

            "article_content": "> Space\n\nAfter calls with foreign leaders, rap sessions with lawmakers, and long classified briefings with advisers, President Jimmy Carter would often escape to the roof of the White House.\n\nThere his son Jeffrey had set up a tracking telescope, Carter said in his book, A Full Life. Feeling the weight of the world, he would gaze at the stars and contemplate his place among them.\n\n\"I recall one winter night going to the White House roof to study the Orion nebulae, but we could barely see the stars, their images so paled by city lights,\" he waxed in a poem.\n\nThat particular evening, on Dec. 18, 1977, the astrophysicist Carl Sagan joined him. They had just visited the U.S. Naval Observatory next to the vice president\u2019s mansion, where they discussed all things space \u2014 planets , stars, black holes , and astrobiology . Carter himself was a man of science: He studied engineering in college and did graduate work in nuclear physics .\n\n\"It was a welcome diversion from earthly concerns,\" he wrote in a thank-you note to Sagan.\n\nCarter, who died on Dec. 29, 2024 at 100, was an avid astronomer, with a profound curiosity for the cosmos, a part of his story that isn't well-known. It began when he was a lab assistant to an astronomy teacher his freshman year in college, and it continued as he learned celestial navigation in the U.S. Navy, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant. One Christmas while on a ship with his family, he asked the captain if the crew had a sextant on board, a tool for measuring the angle between the horizon and an object in the sky. The captain proceeded to show him one, he said , displayed like a museum artifact in a glass case.\n\nBut politics often eclipsed the former president's appreciation for space. Though his first budget funded the program that became NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope, Carter was maligned for not supporting human spaceflight in the vein of the Apollo program, said Steven Hochman, former special assistant to the president at the Carter Center. He was a supporter of robotic exploration and research that could benefit people's lives, but when it came to the exorbitant cost of sending astronauts into deep space , he preferred spending on domestic concerns.\n\n\"NASA, I believe, has not given him the credit he deserves,\" Hochman told Mashable. \"I believe it is because he was critical of the Space Shuttle program and didn't provide funding for future missions to the moon or Mars.\"\n\nFor years political adversaries ridiculed Carter for having a tinfoil hat, stemming from an incident in 1969 that later circulated in the press. After a Lions Club meeting in Leary, Georgia, Carter and a few other men spotted something strange moving in the sky: a luminous object, first blue then red, the apparent size and brightness of the moon . About four years later, Carter reported the unidentified flying object to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena and the International UFO Bureau in Oklahoma.\n\nThough Carter never claimed to have spotted aliens or a flying saucer \u2014 to him this was literally an unknown object in the air \u2014 people snickered and mistook his UFO sighting as such. Skeptics, who likely knew nothing of Carter's astronomy background, suggested he had merely seen Venus .\n\n\"It was not Venus,\" Carter said in a 2007 interview on \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" podcast.\n\nIn fact, his UFO sighting had taken on such mythic proportions, some had wondered whether it was the reason Carter wanted NASA to investigate UFOs in 1977. Despite a White House request expressing a need to address the general UFO \"public relations problem,\" NASA had, surprisingly, declined.\n\nThe subject prompted The Journal of Scientific Exploration to invite Richard C. Henry, the agency's deputy director of astrophysics during Carter's administration, to write an essay about it more than a decade later. Henry, a semi-retired professor at Johns Hopkins University today, came to no definitive conclusions on why NASA rebuffed the White House. But, in a postscript , Henry said he sent his draft to Carter before publication in 1988.\n\n\"The most important point that you could clarify, if you will, is whether you yourself were behind (the UFO panel proposal) letter of July 21, 1977, to NASA,\" Henry wrote.\n\nBeside the sentence, Carter jotted his reply in one word: No.\n\nYet buried within Henry's paper was a small window into Carter's passion for astronomy. In November 1977, the president and his son sent a message to NASA headquarters asking to borrow a seven-inch Questar telescope. Given that there were no telescopes at headquarters \u2014 just paper, Henry said \u2014 he tried to hunt one down at another NASA campus.\n\nIt turned out Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, had one.\n\n\"By great luck, a NASA plane was flying from Huntsville to Washington the next day ([Science adviser Frank] Press was emphatic that the President wanted no special flights or other waste of taxpayer dollars),\" Henry wrote.\n\nThe NASA official and his wife, Rita Mahon, picked up the Questar at Washington National Airport and promptly took it to the White House. They then unpacked the telescope from a large wooden crate and showed the Carters how to set it up on the Truman balcony overlooking the South Lawn. The night was cloudy, but they trained on the moon.\n\nThe president then proceeded to take the telescope with him to Camp David near Thurmont, Maryland, on Nov. 23, 1977, where he and his family spent Thanksgiving, according to his daily diary . He returned it about a week later.\n\nOne has to wonder if Carter brought a telescope with him again just 10 months later, when he invited Egyptian President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to join him at the retreat. The renowned talks would result in the Camp David Accords , which later earned the Middle East leaders a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThere's an amusing irony to the false urban legend that Carter believed he was visited by aliens: He is, after all, the most likely person to make humanity's introduction to extraterrestrials.\n\nSome 15.5 billion miles away from Earth, hurtling through the cold, uncharted abyss, is NASA's Voyager 1 probe. It is the farthest spacecraft from home, having left the solar system in 2012. Soaring through interstellar space at 38,000 mph , it carries a gold-plated record produced by Sagan, with a melange of sounds from the planet.\n\nCrickets. Wind. Greetings in 55 languages, from Akkadian to Wu. A mother kissing her child. These and a letter from Carter are among the recordings on the disk.\n\nThe odds of making contact with aliens, if they exist, are slight, if not insurmountable. Galaxies are spinning away from each other into the infinite unknown. The speed at which space is expanding far outpaces our technology to overcome it. It's as if the universe were contrived to keep its inhabitants apart.\n\nBut should some other intelligent life forms encounter Voyager \u2014 or Voyager 2 , which carries a duplicate record \u2014 thousands or even billions of years into the future, they will discover Carter's words:\n\n\"This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings,\" he wrote. \"We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe.\"\n\nMany knew Carter's intimate relationship with his faith. He grew up Southern Baptist, the son of a farmer in the boomtown of Plains, Georgia. He referred to himself as a born-again Christian. Long after his presidency, he attended regular church services and taught Sunday School .\n\nBut how his evangelical beliefs squared with his thoughts on the universe aren't clear. He wrote in a poem, titled \"Considering the Void:\"\n\nWhen I behold the charm / of evening skies, their lulling endurance; / the patterns of stars with names / of bears and dogs, a swan, a virgin; / other planets that our Voyager showed / were like and so unlike our own, / with all their moons, / bright discs, weird rings, and cratered faces; / comets with their streaming tails / bent by pressure from our sun; / the skyscape of our Milky Way / holding in its shimmering disc /an infinity of suns / (or say a thousand billion); / knowing there are holes of darkness / gulping mass and even light, / knowing that this galaxy of ours / is one of multitudes / in what we call the heavens, / it troubles me. It troubles me.\n\nWhat exactly was haunting Carter? Was he expressing a collision of faith and science in what lies beyond? An existential crisis of never knowing the big picture?\n\nPerhaps, as he wished, humankind will survive this time so that we may live to know more."

While the admission fee for the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) exam has been reduced to Tk200, it is unacceptable that students are being charged an application fee of Tk1,200.\"\n\n\"We urged the university administration to reduce all types of fees as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\nMohammad Shakil, a student from the Department of Sociology, said \"The discrimination we aimed to eliminate for a fairer society has not ended. The main goal of the July Movement was to properly assess merit, but quotas continue to take precedence over merit. This contradicts the very spirit of the July Revolution.\"\n\nHe added, 'Only quotas for backward communities should remain, but the students admitted under the meritorious quota mostly come from highly educated and wealthy families. This is extreme discrimination, and it is an insult to the martyrs of the July Revolution.'\"\n\nKiran Hawlader, a student from the Department of Chemical Engineering and Polymer Science, said: \"We have been demanding a reduction in application, admission, semester, and credit fees for a long time.\"\n\n\"Although the university administration has given assurances, no action has been taken so far.\"\n\n\"We are warning that we should not have to take to the streets to resolve issues that can be settled through dialogue,\" Kiran added.\n\nThe protesters have called for the postponement of the application process, which is scheduled to begin on 5 January, until the fees are revised."

A. Dange, Madras led by Singaravelu, United Provinces led by Shaukat Usmani, Punjab, Sindh led by Ghulam Hussain and Bengal led by Muzaffar Ahmed, formed Tashkent group of Contacts.\n\n---Advertisement---\n\nHowever, M. N. Roy, Evelyn Trent-Roy, Abani Mukherji, Rosa Fitingov, Mohammad Ali, Mohamad Shafiq, and M. P. T. Acharya established the Communist Party of India in Tashkent on October 17, 1920. But, they did not adopt a \u201cparty constitution\u201d, a prerequisite required to be considered for membership of the Communist International.\n\nCPI Established In 1925\n\nOfficially, the CPI was set up on December 26, 1925, at the first Party Conference in Kanpur, by a group of communist leaders. S. V. Ghate was the first General Secretary of the CPI.\n\nThe CPI was poorly organised between 1920 and 1930, in fact, there were many factions, all claiming to be independent parties of their own rights. But the British government banned all of them, carried out crackdowns and crushed them mercilessly.\n\nThe CPI faced trials for three conspiracy cases between 1921 and 1924: the Peshawar Conspiracy Case, the Meerut Conspiracy Case, and the Kanpur Bolshevik Conspiracy Case.\n\nDynamic Shift In CPI Policies\n\nThe CPI underwent a dynamic shift in its policies due to the chaotic internal problems after independence and suffered ideological differences as well.\n\nAfter B T Ranadive was elected General Secretary at the second party congress, the CPI adopted \u2018Programme of Democratic Revolution\u2019.\n\nIt was epoch-making in the sense that it included the struggle against caste injustice in a CPI document for the first time.\n\nCPI For Armed Rebellion\n\nExpanding the concept of class struggle, the CPI waged a rebellion in Telangana and the Nizam of Hyderabad.\n\nThe communist party raised a people\u2019s army and militia and controlled an area with a population of three million.\n\nThe authorities brutally crushed the rebellion, and the CPI was forced to abandon the policy of armed struggle.\n\nBT Ranadive was denounced as a \u2018left adventurist\u2019 and the party dumped him.\n\nExpansion Of CPI\n\nThe CPI was established in Bihar in 1939 and it gained tremendous success and emerged as one of the biggest communist force in the country.\n\nThe grandiose success of communists in Bihar during the 1960s and 1970s placed the communist party in the forefront of left movement in India.\n\nBihar produced some of the legendary leaders like Sahajanand Saraswati and Karyanand Sharma, intellectual giants like Jagannath Sarkar, Yogendra Sharma, and Indradeep Sinha, mass leaders like Chandrasekhar Singh and Sunil Mukherjee, Trade Union leaders like Kedar Das and others.\n\nBesides, Bhogendra Jha led the fight against the Mahants and Zamindars in Mithila region of Bihar. He won Parliamentary elections and was MP for seven terms.\n\nCPI Splits\n\nThe CPI was divided in 1964 on ideological lines, two different party conferences were held, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was born.\n\nThe CPI was divided on the issue of supporting the Congress, it continued doing so and joined the United Front government in Kerala during 1970-77 with C. Achutha Menon as Chief Minister.\n\nPolitical observers believe the United Front government exploited the opportunity to punish those from the managerial classes, money lenders, bosses with anti-labour stances, ration shopkeepers and truckers engaged in black marketing, under stringent provisions of MISA and DIR. The party used this opportunity to further pursue the class struggle by this this method.\n\nLeft Backs Congress\n\nThe CPI along with the CPIM and other left parties, supported the Manmohan Singh-led Congress government from outside in 2004. This leftist party backed the left to centre party for a price, it forged a Common Minimum Programme, that focused on discontinuing disinvestment, inreasing massive social sector outlays and pursuing an independent foreign policy.\n\nHowever, the fissures in the coalition became apparent after Manmohan Singh government signed the Civil Nuclear Treaty or the 123 Treaty with the US.\n\nAccusing the government of surrendering to Washington, the left parties, including the CPI pulled th plug. CPI(M), General Secretary Prakash Karat, announced on July 8, 2008, that the Left was withdrawing its support.\n\nLeft Front Governments\n\nThe CPI was in the Left Front government in West Bengal from 1977 to 2011. It also enjoyed government as a Left Front constituent in Tripura from 1993 to 2018.\n\nThe CPI is a part of the Left Front government in Kerala and it has four Cabinet Ministers. Similarly, it is also in the Tamil Nadu government led by M. K. Stalin.\n\nHowever, the political analysts ask if the party has achieved its basic aim of armed rebellion and setting up of a socialist state.\n\nHas CPI Deviated?\n\nThey also allege that the CPI has deviated from its path, jettisoned armed rebellion, left class struggle and adopted parliamentary democracy, which they had earlier rejected as \u201cpigsty\u201d of the house of pigs.\n\nThe party also must come out with a concrete answer at least now because a period of a hundred years is not a small time span. Even in the diverse and caste-ridden society of India, the masse should have been consolidated for an armed rebellion by now.\n\nHowever, political analysts point out, the CPI does not talk about the revolution anymore, they talk about winning an election. Was the CPI established for this?\n\nThe masses for whom the party claims to have been fighting must get the right answer."
