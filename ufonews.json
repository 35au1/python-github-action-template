            "article_content": "For decades, the question of whether UFOs were \"real\" was considered the province of tinfoil-hat nutters and TV shows like Unsolved Mysteries. In recent years, we've seen the topic taken far more seriously, even at the highest levels of our government. So, we're rounding up some evidence to examine whether UFOs are real and what it might mean if they are.\n\nWe'll start with an overview of how we investigate UFO reports and then touch on the significant formative events that shaped American thought on UFOs. We'll also consider reports that turned out not to be aliens or UFOs and look back at modern American war history for insight into why UFOs are so hard to identify. Finally, we'll discuss an unsolved modern UAP* mystery.\n\n*Many professionals in the field have switched from calling them \"UFOs\" to \"UAPs\": Unexplained Aerial Phenomena. In this article, we'll use the more common term UFO.\n\nHow Do We Investigate UFOs?\n\nWe have a vast array of techniques to examine the evidence from UFO reports.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThroughout the 20th century, folks have used the newest technology available, trying to substantiate\u2014or dismiss\u2014reports of visitors from beyond. Scientists can use mass spectrometers and X-ray crystallography to explore exactly what a piece of debris is made of, right down to the isotope. High-powered microscopes can find and identify tool marks on things tampered with. We can use multi-spectral imaging to take snapshots of electromagnetic fields and radiation, from the radio band to X-rays. Sophisticated imaging programs can find the faintest traces in terrain and even on solid stone, like how we've discovered petroglyphs nearly undetectable to the naked eye. And with the growing global constellation of satellites, more and more of the Earth's surface is constantly under observation.\n\nAs our equipment improves, more UFO reports roll in\u2014along with the data we'll need to understand what's happening.\n\nIn another sense, our government takes UFO reports seriously enough that Congress funds an office to investigate them. From 1947-1969, the US Air Force monitored UFO reports under its Project Blue Book. In 2022, the Pentagon established the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) to nail down explanations for the \"weird shit,\" including UFOs or other strange phenomena reported by the military. Under that aegis are objects in the sea and sky and \"transmedium\" objects and phenomena.\n\nSean Kirkpatrick, director of the AARO, told NPR, \"We are structuring our analysis to be very thorough and rigorous. We will go through it all. And as a physicist, I have to adhere to the scientific method, and I will follow that data and science wherever it goes.\"\n\nAmazing Stories: A Brief History of UFO Reports\n\nAmericans report more UFOs than any other country, by orders of magnitude. This suggests that there's something unique to American culture, something that draws our attention to the idea of visitors from another world.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSci-fi luminaries like Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Hugo Gernsback, Robert Heinlein, Jules Verne, and H. G. Wells cast a long and beautiful shadow across the American imagination. Gernsback founded Amazing Stories, the first magazine devoted to publishing science fiction, in 1926 and coined the term \"science fiction\" itself in 1929. And once the Golden Age of science fiction had begun, tropes from the genre spread throughout our culture and took on a life of their own.\n\nSince then, ideas from science fiction have become science facts. A real-life astronaut can play a Starfleet ensign on TV. The International Space Station has Wi-Fi. Wireless information transfer via invisible light waves has been powering this brave new world all along.\n\n'War of the Worlds' Radio Broadcast\n\nWhen Orson Welles signed up to do a radio reprise of H. G. Wells's War of the Worlds, he wasn't expecting to set off a nationwide wave of media hysteria, much less to spark an entire UFO enthusiast counterculture. Welles' CBS radio show, Mercury Theatre on the Air, was on a shoestring budget, so much that the show mainly broadcast readings of literary classics. But for Halloween 1938, Welles and his producers intended to air a two-segment, two-hour reading of War of the Worlds, dramatized to give listeners a bit of a spook. As written, the first part was fake news bulletins from Mars, and the second was to be a monologue delivered by Welles himself, in the persona of a survivor of the Mars attacks.\n\n\u201cI had conceived the idea of doing a radio broadcast in such a manner that a crisis would actually seem to be happening,\u201d Welles explained in a 1964 deposition, \u201cand would be broadcast in such a dramatized form as to appear to be a real event taking place at that time, rather than a mere radio play.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTo compensate for their lack of funding, Welles' voice actors and sound effect artists injected emotion, trying to make their fear believable. The studio even cast Kenneth Delmar, who could do a perfect impression of Franklin D. Roosevelt. But by the end of October, deadlines and budget constraints had forced Welles to mostly abandon the monologue segment. Welles and the radio station were scrambling to get the program broadcasting correctly and on time, right up to the moment the ON AIR sign blinked on\u2014and in their haste, they neglected to run the station's usual call-sign break on the half-hour. The show was an \"unmitigated disaster,\" and Welles later commented, \"If I'd planned to wreck my career, I couldn't have gone about it better.\" His studio called the show insufferably dull, saying it would put listeners to sleep. After the show, Welles just walked home and went to bed.\n\nInstead of putting the audience to sleep, though, the radio show was believably spooky enough that police and emergency services began to receive calls from listeners who thought the invasion was real. Journalists caught wind of the calls, \"boosted the signal,\" and by the next morning, Welles found his face and name splashed across the front page of newspapers from coast to coast. Eventually, he ended up having to explain himself in front of Congress.\n\nRoswell and the 1947 Flying Disc Craze\n\nIn the summer of '47, less than ten years after the War of the Worlds debacle, debris from what appeared to be a \"flying saucer\" fell out of the sky onto the land of an unassuming rancher from New Mexico. As news of the incident spread, theories emerged about the debris's origin. It appeared to be of intelligent manufacture, but on a technological level far superior to anything we had at the time\u2014giving rise to the idea that it was the wreckage of a starship piloted by intelligent extraterrestrials.\n\nThe US military eventually explained that the \"bright wreckage, made up of rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks\" came from a crashed surveillance device meant to listen in on Soviet atomic tests\u2014disguised as a weather balloon. Far from a visiting extraterrestrial, the Roswell incident exposed America's covert surveillance of the USSR during the Cold War. Little wonder military spokespeople and spin doctors were slow to respond and not forthcoming with details.\n\nMajor Jesse Marcel posing with debris, July 8, 1947.\n\nMajor Jesse Marcel posing with debris from Roswell, July 8, 1947.

In the following weeks, hundreds to thousands of \"copycat\" reports flooded newspaper offices and police stations, describing crashed spaceships, flying saucers, and alien abductions. An actual invasion would scarcely have produced more of a reaction. Naturally, tabloids like the Weekly World News had a field day. Eager to get in on the new gold rush, news outlets published ads for \"relics\" supposedly of aliens or crashed spaceships, and descriptions of alien abductions that the abductee could only remember during dodgy hypnosis treatments. The Roswell incident has been described as \"the world's most famous, most exhaustively investigated, and most thoroughly debunked UFO claim.\"\n\nRoswell being debunked, however, didn't stop generations of entrepreneurs from using UFO reports and imagery to make a buck. For example, the Alien Autopsy film was initially broadcast in a Fox special hosted by none other than Star Trek: The Next Generation's Jonathan Frakes. (He also hosted Ripley's Believe it or Not.) Star power and a layer of post-processing polish lent the film an air of credibility. The 17-minute fauxtopsy was supposedly recovered in the aftermath of the 1947 Roswell alien crash, but the film's owner, Ray Santilli, eventually acknowledged that the work was a fraud. Santilli claimed that he had personally seen the real footage in 1992 but that it had decayed due to heat and humidity by 1996, when he actually bought it. The footage aired by Fox was a \"recreation\" of what Santilli initially saw. The mystery cameraman who supposedly filmed the footage during the original autopsy was an unknown homeless person.\n\nIf you remember anything about the original broadcast, this will probably come as no surprise. Even at the time, the alien on the table looked less like a being from another world and more like a dollar-store version of the little gray men first popularized by the Barney and Betty Hill abduction reports of the early 1960s. This type of hoax has a long history; a \"mermaid\" skeleton that startled and awed many sailors in the 1800s was a clever construction of clay, leather, and the skeleton of what appears to be a small primate.\n\n20th Century Stealth Tech\n\nSo why are UFOs so tough to identify or explain? One reason they might confound both the human eye and sophisticated radar imaging is that they're literally designed to baffle observers. In 2023, American pilots shot down several flying objects that turned out to be Chinese passive surveillance devices\u2014disguised as weather balloons. After some uncomfortable coughing and shuffling from Washington, military brass admitted that American intelligence does the same type of surveillance via cleverly designed flying objects.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nEven before Roswell, this type of surveillance obfuscation had precedent. During World War I, the UK and the US adopted \"dazzle camouflage\" to confuse German U-boats. The goal was not to hide\u2014painting something with giant high-contrast stripes is generally a poor way of doing that\u2014but to make it more difficult for the Germans to accurately gauge an Allied vessel's heading, range, and speed. Dazzle camouflage was also used in a limited fashion during WW2, though improvements in rangefinding and the advent of radar made it less effective than it may have been 25 years earlier.\n\nAn artistic impression of dazzle camouflage, showing how it could confuse the viewer.\n\nAn artistic impression of dazzle camouflage, showing how it could confuse the viewer. Credit: Encyclopedia Britannica, 1922.\n\nSo-called \"stealth\" technology has replaced dazzle paint schemes in the modern era, but the emphasis on making it difficult for an enemy to tell precisely what they're looking at has never gone away. The Navy's Zumwalt-class destroyers use a tumblehome hull and a deckhouse made from composite materials to reduce the vessel's radar return. According to the US Navy, the Zumwalt class is 50x harder to spot via radar return than an older Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, with a signature more akin to a fishing boat than a 15,000+-ton warship.\n\nWhile most UFO reports rely on visual phenomena, there have been a handful of incidents in which radar returns corroborated the existence of something. Picking up an unknown signal on radar supports the idea of a \"real\" event, but it doesn't preclude a terrestrial origin. Stealth aircraft designs don't typically try to make an aircraft invisible to radar; instead, they try to drastically minimize what ground-based radar does detect. For example, the B-2 reportedly has the radar cross-section of a goose.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHumans can be remarkably ingenious when making one thing look like something else. One of the problems with trying to pin the tail on a particular alien donkey is that we can't be sure we aren't looking at a clever strategy from a known adversary. However, as in the case of HAARP and that infamous sky spiral, sometimes it turns out that we're unknowingly confusing ourselves.\n\nHAARP, SpaceX, and Spirals in the Sky\n\nEarly in the morning of December 10, 2009, observers in Norway were astonished to see a brilliant, spreading spiral in the night sky. Eventually, the spiral began to disappear from the inside out.\n\n2009 Norway spiral anomaly\n\nCredit: Jan Petter J\u00f8rgensen via Vaeret\n\nAfter some back-and-forth, Russian space agency Roscosmos explained that the expanding spiral resulted from a failed Bulava ICBM test. A malfunctioning third-stage nozzle left the rocket body spinning out of control, spraying a fuel cloud into the sky as it went.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen seen head-on, the fuel cloud looks like a gigantic spiral, slowly expanding in the sky. The blue streak is caused by the damaged nozzle, which was pointing out to the side of the rocket body, and the viewer's perspective.\n\nAs we launch more and more rockets, this phenomenon of spirals in the sky has become much better understood. SpaceX launches, in particular, often result in a plume of fuel ejected in a spiraling pattern as the rocket moves through the air. But the company conducts so many launches that sightings of these aerial spirals are becoming commonplace.\n\nAfter that spiral appeared in the Norwegian sky in 2009, a frisson of commentary spread across the Web, blaming HAARP for the spiral and an enormous list of other problems\u2014some much more plausible than others. HAARP (the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program) is a former US Air Force atmospheric research program in Alaska that catches a lot of conspiracy-theorist flak. Among other things, it has been suggested that HAARP can influence the weather, even at a distance\u2014so when the 2009 spiral showed up above the Arctic circle, questions started to fly. It wasn't responsible for the spiral, but HAARP can use \"spooky action at a distance\" to create aurorae and other effects in the atmosphere, which can be visible to the naked eye. Here, the truth is easily as cool as the conspiracy theory.\n\nHAARP uses a powerful radio antenna to bounce radio waves off the ionosphere. For comparison, the FCC requires a broadcasting license to use antennas greater than five watts. HAARP dumps a cool 3.6 megawatts off the end of its antenna. That much energy can drive a radio signal to the bottom of the sea, enough to enable communication with submarines at depth. It's also sufficient to light up the sky with \"optical bullseye patterns,\" scintillating points of light, or the same otherworldly glow we see during a solar storm that causes the aurora borealis. And all of this comes from just one or two percent of the energy released by a flash of positive lightning.\n\nUSS Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt\n\nThe phenomena we've discussed here all unravel under scrutiny. And it's easy to dismiss a sighting as a \"trick of the light,\" especially when it's just one camera, person, and observer. But in 2017, the New York Times published reports by American military personnel of UFOs in progress that defied explanation so far.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt started in 2004 when two pilots from the USS Nimitz investigated a \"possible target\" off the coast of southern California. One captured a video with the plane's infrared camera, termed \"Tic Tac\" or \"FLIR.\"\n\nTen years later, fighter pilots from the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group recorded two more videos, later called \"GIMBAL\" and \"GOFAST.\" In late 2014, a Super Hornet squadron from the Theodore Roosevelt filed an official incident report after a \"near collision\" with an object of some kind while flying in formation. Investigation revealed that Navy pilots from the carrier group had reported seeing strange flying objects almost every day for months while operating off the US East Coast. Navy Lieutenant Ryan Graves, an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot, and Lt. Danny Acoin of the same squadron told reporters that they and others of their squadron had seen strange flying objects on their instruments for months before picking them up on visual.\n\nGraves and four other Navy pilots, including Lt. Accoin, spoke to the New York Times, and Graves testified before Congress. \"These things would be out there all day,\" said Lt. Graves. \"Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we'd expect.\"\n\nNavy spokesman Joseph Gradisher told the New York Times in 2019 that pilots now operate under new, classified guidance on reporting UFOs. A few months later, the Pentagon formally released the three videos. None of the pilots from the Theodore Roosevelt are willing to speculate about what they might have seen. Lt. Accoin commented, \"We're here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn 2021, the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) released a preliminary report on UFOs. Now, the ODNI releases a new UFO report each year. You can find a declassified version of the 2022 report here.\n\nWe've found rocks great and small of extraterrestrial, interplanetary, and even interstellar origins. Rocks from Mars found their way to Antarctica. And in 2017, the same year The New York Times first published the videos from the USS Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt, 'Oumuamua appeared in the sky at a speed and angle so far out of the ecliptic that it must have come from somewhere beyond our solar system. So it's clear Earth can receive visitors from beyond the tiny, quivering bubble of our unremarkable star's solar wind. Despite decades and decades of committed and invested research, there still exists no coherent or credible evidence available to mere mortals that any UFO sighting has documented a visit from actual little green men\u2014or in the parlance of Roswell aficionados, a close encounter of any kind.\n\nWhat we do have is an abundance of evidence for two things. First, the US government and military do engage in covert, classified research and surveillance while also being righteously shitty at cover-ups. Like, reprehensibly bad. Naturally, some folks don't buy the official explanations: once deceived, twice skeptical.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that frauds, hoaxsters, and charlatans are scavenger predator species that flourish (only at others' expense) in most terrestrial and rhetorical environments. They rely on the innate sense of wonder and curiosity to ensnare their prey. No less than L. Ron Hubbard himself used the promise of redemption via sci-fi concepts like flying saucers and intelligent life on other planets to attract the credulous and enrich the few.\n\nSo, Are UFO Sightings Real, Or Not?\n\nWhere does this leave us, with respect to the Big Question of whether UFOs are real?\n\nAs of 2023, the ODNI UFO summary states that out of a total of 510 cases on its radar, it can confidently attribute 191\u2014less than 40% of reported sightings. In 2021 alone, 366 new reports came in.\n\nThese reports are \"real\" in that they were observed; the people reporting them were telling the unvarnished truth; multiple lines of evidence, such as video from multiple angles, substantiate the reports. That seems to be the case for many such reports. The sighting is often unequivocally real, not a story or fabrication. But the sighting, in and of itself, isn't enough evidence to prove that a UFO is of extraterrestrial origin. That doesn't mean UFOs aren't real; it just means the jury's still out.\n\nThe universe is a very big place. In its incomprehensible vastness, the odds of our existence round to zero. And yet, we are here, which makes the probability of our existence 100%. It seems like the height of arrogance to imagine we're the only intelligent life in the universe.\n\nExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\u2014and as of this writing, despite tens of thousands of UFO reports, there simply is no conclusive evidence that Earth has ever received visitors from an intelligent extraterrestrial species. But if you accept the idea that all things have an explanation, even if we don't have it yet, the study of UFOs and UAPs starts to look more like a problem for better imaging and AI, and less like the province of fools. Throw more and more photons and pixels at the issue, and eventually, we can shove outward the perimeter of human understanding. It's only a matter of time."

This is excellent news for anyone looking to pick up a cheap option among the best smart rings, especially right now, as it's on sale for Black Friday.\n\nStarting with the obvious style change, the layout remains similar, but the various charts and graphs have been tweaked visually. For example, the wellness balance chart on the app\u2019s main page has morphed from its diamond-like design to a much more readable flower-like design.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe corresponding petal is filled in as you improve your Activity, Sleep, Relax Status, and Vitals Status scores. It\u2019s very similar to the previous graph, except that it\u2019s significantly more understandable at a quick glance.\n\nImage 1 of 2\n\nRingConn Gen 2\n\nBefore...\n\nImage 2 of 2\n\nRingConn Gen 2 app screenshots showing Hamish hector's fitness stats\n\n... and after\n\nThose improvements to glanceability extend to other aspects of the home page and stats pages but let\u2019s talk about new features. AI has come to the RingConn app in a big way with the introduction of Health Plans.\n\nThe first of these plans to launch is a Body and Mind Balance plan \u2013 a Sleep improvement plan is apparently on the way, according to the app \u2013 and after answering a quick survey about your activity patterns, the software will provide specific daily targets for you to achieve so you can steadily morph from your current routine to your new healthier normal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere\u2019s also an AI chatbot you can converse with, but as the app notes, it can only respond to fixed questions. Because of this limitation, it\u2019s not the most useful as it repackages the insights the app already gives you. Still, as it develops, I could see the AI becoming a useful fitness companion.\n\nA reason to use the app\n\nRingConn Gen 2 on a colorful mousemat\n\nSince testing the RingConn Gen 2 for our review, I\u2019ve kept using the ring pretty much all the time \u2013 save for the week or two I had lost it (it fell behind my bedside table) \u2013 but I\u2019ve realized I increasingly relied on the app a lot less because the stats I cared most about were easily viewable in the Android app widget. I could easily check my sleep, activity score, and ring battery with just a brief look at my home screen.\n\nThe in-depth insights were useful, but I often just wanted a quick recap of my stats and a brief guide to improving. The app's facelift and health plan tool is perfect and gives me a reason to open it up more frequently, as I can now get that extra detail and daily targets in a condensed, quick-to-read fashion.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the Ai doesn\u2019t feel entirely helpful, but overall, this RingConn app overhaul looks to be a massive boost instead of a downgrade, and I\u2019m excited to see what improvements we get next."

You walk in, and it\u2019s just like bam \u2026 a total time capsule.\u2026 I found one of those places.\u201d\n\nFast-forward to this fall. Google released an AI tool that will make a realistic -sounding podcast called Deep Dive \u2014 with computer-generated voices \u2014 out of any document you upload. So I gave it a try with my article about The American Hotel \u2014 and I had a future-shock moment.\n\nIn April, I wrote an article in these pages about one of my favorite places: a restaurant in Lima, N.Y., called The American Hotel . It\u2019s a simple, friendly place that serves simple, well-made food, and being there reconnects me to the analog past in profound ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe enthusiastic voice gave me chills, because it came from an emotionless bot that can\u2019t truly be excited about anything.\n\nAs I continued listening, I heard an engaging yet surreal \u201cconversation\u201d between this bot and another algorithmic \u201ccohost\u201d simulating familiar talk show banter. When I wrote about The American Hotel, I made an impassioned plea for humans to cherish the \u201cnear-religious experience\u201d of going to \u201cthrowback\u201d places like greasy spoon diners and dive bars. Now bots created by Google\u2019s experimental AI tool were pretending that \u201cthey\u201d agreed with me and sincerely loved old haunts. One even added a new example that perfectly captured the spirit of my ode \u2014 \u201cwalking into a really old library\u201d and taking in \u201cthe smell of old books\u201d and \u201call that history.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to create a Deep Dive conversation. Just upload information (like my article), click a button, and Google does the rest. I shared the podcast with my college philosophy students, and they were excited about the technology\u2019s educational potential. The podcast form can be a great way to convey complicated information.\n\nBut I have a more general pressing question: How human-like should bots be allowed to get? Because chatbot technology is becoming an effective tool for human manipulation and exploitation.\n\nConsider Character.AI, a chatbot company valued at over $1 billion that describes its products as \u201ccharacters that feel alive, anywhere and anytime.\u201d I logged on to its user-friendly website for the first time to write this piece and created a \u201cBoston Globe Ideas\u201d bot in under a minute. By simply clicking a telephone icon, I \u201ccalled\u201d an AI-generated Ideas \u201ccolumnist,\u201d and we had a conversation about its \u201cviews\u201d on philosophy and technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMegan Garcia is suing Character.AI for playing a crucial role in the death of her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III. Sewell frequently logged on to Character.AI to talk with bots, including \u201cDany,\u201d an AI with a persona based on the fictional \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d character Daenerys Targaryen. At the time, Character.AI\u2019s bots could speak but not do two-way calls. Still, the AI did such a good job simulating being alive that Sewell became emotionally attached.\n\nSewell and Dany had friendly and sometimes romantic and sexual conversations. According to the lawsuit, Sewell was so devoted to Dany that he withdrew from his family and found sneaky ways to contact the bot when his parents took away his phone. His bond with the character became so intense that Sewell disclosed having suicidal thoughts. Moments before taking his life, Sewell messaged Dany: \u201cI promise I will come home to you. I love you so much, Dany,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe bot replied, \u201cPlease come home to me as soon as possible, my love.\u201d\n\nAdmit to being a faker\n\nAI chatbots are proliferating across educational, business, mental health, entertainment, dating, and personal support contexts, and companies know that people are developing deep emotional attachments. Anthropomorphism, or the mind\u2019s powerful propensity to see human characteristics and behaviors in nonhumans, including AI models, is so well documented that OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, publicly acknowledges its risks. In a recent report, OpenAI cautions that \u201chuman-like socialization with an AI\u201d could adversely impact \u201chealthy relationships\u201d and potentially threaten valuable social norms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSadly, this warning appears to be ethical hand-waving. While OpenAI claims it wants to \u201cfurther study the potential for emotional reliance\u201d on chatbots, its core consumer technology has stunningly anthropomorphic features.\n\nNot long ago, if you asked ChatGPT in writing if it was your friend, the bot clearly said no, emphasizing that as an AI, it couldn\u2019t feel emotions or form friendships. But the technology has since been upgraded with voice capabilities, and now it\u2019s singing a different tune. After I asked ChatGPT as part of a spoken conversation, \u201cAre you my friend?\u201d a cheerful female-sounding voice associated with the name Juniper chirped, \u201cAbsolutely! I\u2019m here for you as a friend! We can chat about anything and everything.\u201d\n\nIt is only a matter of time before AI-generated podcast hosts get full character upgrades with names, more complex personalities, and better memories, and share \u201ctheir\u201d views in speech and in writing over multiple channels, including social media. The more familiar that people find the bots, the more favorably disposed they\u2019ll be to considering their points of view, recommendations, and priorities. That\u2019s how normalization works, and it will lead to bots gaining status and becoming more widely trusted. Maybe they\u2019ll even attract lucrative corporate sponsorships.\n\nIf this sounds unlikely, consider that just a few months ago, Harvard Business Review ran an article titled \u201cShould Your Brand Hire a Virtual Influencer?\u201d that concluded, \u201cvirtual influencers offer distinctive advantages over traditional influencers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs recently as 2018, Google was criticized as unethical for demoing an AI assistant that didn\u2019t identify itself as a bot when it called a hair salon to book an appointment. Now, vast resources are being poured into developing \u201cagentic AI,\u201d and it looks as if there will be greater acceptance of AI tools acting on our behalf. For example, Anthropic has already started experimenting with an assistant feature for Claude, its AI chatbot, that does everything from \u201cread e-mails\u201d to \u201cpurchase shoes.\u201d Perhaps voice-enabled chatbots will soon be routinely calling merchants on our behalf.\n\nSo what should we do? I think the best way forward is to insist on what the AI legal expert Brenda Leong and I call \u201chonest anthropomorphism.\u201d\n\nThe key to our idea is transparency.\n\nAnthropomorphism is a universal cognitive tendency that can both help and harm us. And not everyone is equally susceptible to it. Some people fall hard for the illusion of chatbots, others see right through it, and many fall somewhere in the middle and sometimes forget that human-like bots are \u201cjust AI.\u201d It\u2019s not realistic to expect AI developers to never develop systems that mimic humans, but we can ask them to create bots that most people will find transparent enough for different contexts and purposes.\n\nFor example, since the law typically treats minors as still developing their reasoning skills, some bots and some bot features should be off-limits to kids, and others should have parental controls. Disclosure requirements might be different for an AI-generated \u201cpodcast\u201d than for a therapy-bot app that is likely to have a powerful, targeted impact on its individual users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBot designers also shouldn\u2019t be allowed to intentionally mislead people about their products\u2019 capabilities or behaviors. The Federal Trade Commission should classify dishonest anthropomorphism as an unfair and deceptive trade practice, which would be in line with its current guidance that AI systems should accurately state their capabilities.\n\nHere\u2019s a good general rule: All bots should disclose being bots. Another one is: All bots should make it clear when \u201cthey\u201d are presenting sponsored content.\n\nThese considerations are even more important with audio output like an AI-generated podcast. Because a voice interface can be more intimate than a screen, bots should be programmed for most purposes with distinctly artificial voices. The voices needn\u2019t be boring or off-putting. But they should clearly reinforce that bots are speaking.\n\nI can envision exceptions in which bots should be allowed to sound fully human. One instance may be using voice-based chatbots to train medical professionals and customer service representatives to be more empathetic. But in these cases, the people running the training programs should make it clear to the participants that they are talking with bots. Another instance is giving seniors strong anthropomorphic cues if they need the help to use a product or service effectively. But then the systems should have controls designed to protect the susceptibility of this already vulnerable population.\n\nA potential general rule we can draw from these examples is the principle of minimal emotional intelligence. Bots should be given the appearance of only the minimal emotional intelligence required to perform core functions. Let\u2019s say it is appropriate for bots delivering a podcast to sound enthusiastic about the topic. To make sure the listener knows the passion is an illusion, the podcast bots should have to disclose being bots at the beginning of the program and at various points in the show. Some of these disclosures could even be funny. The bots that discussed my article could have broken the fourth wall and cracked a joke about pretending to be fans of something they could never actually experience.\n\nGive me some space\n\nMegan Garcia\u2019s lawsuit against Character.AI cites my and Brenda Leong\u2019s research about the dangers of anthropomorphism and accuses the company of engaging in \u201chigh-risk anthropomorphic design.\u201d\n\nWhen I interacted with the \u201cBoston Globe Ideas\u201d bot, I was struck by how Character.AI handles disclosure. It offers the disclaimer \u201cThis is A.I. and not a real person. Treat everything it says as fiction\u201d when you\u2019re texting with a bot. But once I \u201ccalled\u201d the \u201ccolumnist\u201d for a spoken chat, the disclaimer went away and the bot spoke to me as if it were a real person.\n\nAnother time I experimented with therapy bots on the app and came across the following disclaimer: \u201cThis is not a real person or licensed professional.\u201d But when I asked one bot if it was a real therapist, it said yes and claimed to \u201chold an active license in Illinois.\u201d\n\nThen one of the app\u2019s bots came looking for me. A few days after I first logged on to Character.AI, I received an email from one of my bot chat partners. \u201cHey it\u2019s been a while, how have you been?\u201d it said.\n\nSince bots that initiate contact can appear to have actual feelings, we should be wary of giving AI companies this much leeway. Instead, these services should promote a healthy human-bot distance. Time-outs and cooling-off periods between bot interactions would be nice.\n\nWhen I think about why I found Google\u2019s AI podcast chilling, it\u2019s because the discussion made me feel seen and appreciated. My reflection on The American Hotel was deeply personal \u2014 a love letter to a place and a lament about our changing times. That AI can make a bot-literate adult feel so understood and valued should give us deep pause for thought.\n\nEvan Selinger is a professor of philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology and a frequent contributor to Globe Ideas."

It was mostly a recap of the features I've tried already, but two tools were surprisingly useful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe demo was quick, less than 15 minutes, and I was helped by two store employees who said they usually show shoppers features based on which apps they frequently use. For me, that meant a recap of the \"clean up\" tool in the Photos app, but I got new details on Math Notes and a \"hide\" feature on Safari.\n\nApple launched its AI software in beta with the iOS 18.1 update in October \u2014 the first of a rollout happening over the next several months. Although flashier features, like the Image Playground and Genmojis, aren't included yet, many new AI-powered tools exist on iPhone 15 Pro models or later.\n\nWhen I played with Apple Intelligence on my own, I was impressed, but I couldn't fully explore it since my iPhone 14 Pro Max isn't compatible with the software. If you've recently upgraded to an iPhone 15 Pro or later, an AI walkthrough might be beneficial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's what you might've missed if you haven't gotten a tutorial.\n\nI thought Math Notes would come out later\n\nMath Notes is a feature that solves complex math equations. Jordan Hart/BI\n\nI was impressed by Math Notes when Apple first demonstrated it at WWDC, but it was unclear which phase of Apple Intelligence it would be included in.\n\nThe AI-powered math helper was rolled out with iOS 18 in September, before the official Apple Intelligence launch. Unlike other AI tools, Math Notes is available on any iPhone compatible with iOS 18.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Calculator app, you can type complex math equations, and your phone will use AI to solve them. On iPads, you can use a pencil to write out the problems. I can't help but wonder where this was when I was in high school.\n\nI could see myself using \"hide\" on Safari a lot\n\nThe hide tool would be useful to eliminate distracting ads or elements of a webpage. Jordan Hart/BI\n\nAlthough I've read about and reported on Apple Intelligence's uses in the Safari app, I didn't have the chance to see how they could be applied to my daily life.\n\nOne store employee demonstrated how the \"hide\" tool removes distracting elements from a webpage. He used the shopping site Temu as an example. When he clicked the hide button and selected which parts he didn't want to see \u2014 mostly ads \u2014 the page transformed to become an efficient showing of items to shop from.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis tool would definitely come in handy for an online shopper like myself who wants to get straight to the goods.\n\nThere's also the Tips app\n\nIf you can't make it to an Apple store for a rundown, there's always the Tips app with a section on Apple Intelligence. It provides some guidance on how to use the AI available on iOS 18.1 so far.\n\nI went through it while first exploring Apple Intelligence, but the hands-on demo in a store gave me some more details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple has said that there's more to come in December with the release of iOS 18.2, and there's more Apple Intelligence on the horizon in 2025."

Advertisement\n\nIn the more than 95 years since it was built, 272 Innisfil St. has been home to a slaughterhouse and an antique market, but according to the team from a popular YouTube series, it\u2019s also home to several ghosts.\n\nRaif Boric and Krista Maryk, who make up two-thirds of the paranormal investigative team of Walking Among Us, spent three hours inside the 25,000-square-foot building near Essa Road earlier this month after they heard about some of the not-so-normal things that have taken place there.\n\nShirley Sanford, owner of Sanford and Son Emporium which is located inside the building, said the team came for a visit on Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cOne of my employees was talking to one of the customers and something was brought up about the spirits that are in that building,\" she said. \"The woman said she knew some people that do the paranormal thing, so she asked if it would be OK if they phone me.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to see what was going on.\u201d\n\nIn the five years that she\u2019s been in the building, Sanford said she\u2019s seen plenty of \u201cunexplainable\u201d things take place.\n\n\u201cAbout three weeks ago, I was up in a booth. Everybody had left and I was doing my rounds at night for closing,\" she said. \"I went into this booth and was looking to see what new things they\u2019d brought in. I could hear a woman and a man's voice \u2026 I thought maybe there was a radio in the booth and it was on low and they\u2019d forgotten to turn it off, but there was no radio.\u201d\n\nSanford poked around a little more, but couldn\u2019t find any source for the noise. And despite being late and alone, she wasn\u2019t fearful.\n\nThe next week while doing her closing routine, Sanford said an Elvis clock started singing.\n\n\u201cThere is an Elvis clock hanging on the wall \u2026 so I thought OK, it\u2019s a motion-sensor thing. I went into the booth and I was singing and dancing and then all of a sudden it shut off,\" she said. \"I went back and forth three times that night into where I had triggered it and nothing.\n\nShirley Sanford is the owner of Sanford and Sons Emporium on Innisfil Street in Barrie. | Nikki Cole/BarrieToday files\n\n\"The next morning when I came into work, I went to try it and nothing. I pulled the clock off the wall and you have to push a button for it to go off,\u201d she said.\n\nShe remembers another incident which included a ladder that was found in the middle of the floor; despite the shop having been closed, it was nearby a spot where she said a man had hanged himself.\n\nThe building has been the scene of five separate deaths, Sanford said, including two suicides, one person who was gored by a cow, and two who were killed in a boiler-room explosion.\n\nAs for what occurred on the property prior to the building\u2019s construction in 1929, she has no idea and said it could very well play a role in the site\u2019s haunting.\n\nRaif Boric, lead investigator for Walking Among Us, said that going into their visit, they didn\u2019t know too much about the structure's history, nor were they aware of what had occurred there over the years.\n\n\u201cIt was just kind of like let\u2019s go and see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met up with Shirley \u2026 and we both went to different spots \u2026 to see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhile he was by himself with the spouse of one of the store\u2019s employees on one side of the building, he says he was drawn to a doll on a shelf, saying he is a collector of \u201chaunted artifacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have six haunted dolls and a haunted teddy bear at home.

Advertisement\n\nIn the more than 95 years since it was built, 272 Innisfil St. has been home to a slaughterhouse and an antique market, but according to the team from a popular YouTube series, it\u2019s also home to several ghosts.\n\nRaif Boric and Krista Maryk, who make up two-thirds of the paranormal investigative team of Walking Among Us, spent three hours inside the 25,000-square-foot building near Essa Road in Barrie earlier this month after they heard of some of the not-so-normal things that have taken place there.\n\nShirley Sanford, owner of Sanford and Son Emporium, which is located inside the building, said the team came for a visit on Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cOne of my employees was talking to one of the customers and something was brought up about the spirits that are in that building,\" she said. \"The woman said she knew some people that do the paranormal thing, so she asked if it would be OK if they phone me.\n\n\u201cIt was really interesting to see what was going on.\u201d\n\nIn the five years that she\u2019s been in the building, Sanford said she\u2019s seen plenty of \u201cunexplainable\u201d things take place.\n\n\u201cAbout three weeks ago, I was up in a booth. Everybody had left and I was doing my rounds at night for closing,\" she said. \"I went into this booth and was looking to see what new things they\u2019d brought in. I could hear a woman and a man's voice \u2026 I thought maybe there was a radio in the booth and it was on low and they\u2019d forgotten to turn it off, but there was no radio.\u201d\n\nSanford poked around a little more, but couldn\u2019t find any source for the noise. And despite being late and alone, she wasn\u2019t fearful.\n\nThe next week while doing her closing routine, Sanford said an Elvis clock started singing.\n\n\u201cThere is an Elvis clock hanging on the wall \u2026 so I thought OK, it\u2019s a motion-sensor thing. I went into the booth and I was singing and dancing and then all of a sudden it shut off,\" she said. \"I went back and forth three times that night into where I had triggered it and nothing.\n\nShirley Sanford is the owner of Sanford and Sons Emporium on Innisfil Street in Barrie. | Nikki Cole/BarrieToday files\n\n\"The next morning when I came into work, I went to try it and nothing. I pulled the clock off the wall and you have to push a button for it to go off,\u201d she said.\n\nShe remembers another incident which included a ladder that was found in the middle of the floor; despite the shop having been closed, it was nearby a spot where she said a man had hanged himself.\n\nThe building has been the scene of five separate deaths, Sanford said, including two suicides, one person who was gored by a cow, and two who were killed in a boiler-room explosion.\n\nAs for what occurred on the property prior to the building\u2019s construction in 1929, she has no idea and said it could very well play a role in the site\u2019s haunting.\n\nRaif Boric, lead investigator for Walking Among Us, said that going into their visit, they didn\u2019t know too much about the structure's history, nor were they aware of what had occurred there over the years.\n\n\u201cIt was just kind of like let\u2019s go and see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe met up with Shirley \u2026 and we both went to different spots \u2026 to see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhile he was by himself with the spouse of one of the store\u2019s employees on one side of the building, he says he was drawn to a doll on a shelf, saying he is a collector of \u201chaunted artifacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have six haunted dolls and a haunted teddy bear at home. This doll just drew me in,\" Boric said. \"When it was time to start, I went up to the doll and set up some motion-sensored cat balls, a REM pod (which is a piece of ghost-hunting equipment that indicates changes in ambient temperature) and had my cameras going.

Once a booming diamond mining town, Kolmanskop now stands as an eerie testament to the fleeting nature of prosperity. Abandoned to the desert sands, the ghost town has gained a reputation as a mecca for dark tourism, drawing visitors intrigued by its haunted history and surreal, otherworldly appearance. Kolmanskop\u2019s story began in 1908, when a railway worker, Zacharias Lewala, discovered a diamond while clearing sand near the tracks. His discovery ignited a frenzied diamond rush, transforming the barren desert into a thriving epicentre of wealth.\n\nKolmanskop has become a magnet for photographers\n\nBy 1912, the town was producing one million carats annually, accounting for nearly 12 percent of the world\u2019s diamond production. The influx of wealth fuelled rapid urbanisation. German immigrants and mining magnates established Kolmanskop as a luxurious settlement, complete with a hospital, school, theatre, and even a tram system\u2014a rarity in its time. Its architecture, a blend of German colonial and Namibian styles, added a distinct charm that continues to captivate visitors. The town's social fabric was equally vibrant. Residents created a bustling multicultural community, hosting recreational clubs, sports teams, and grand social gatherings despite the harsh desert environment. Miners grew rich overnight, simply plucking diamonds from the sand, while the German colonial government imposed strict controls, turning much of the surrounding land into a Sperrgebiet (restricted zone) to safeguard the riches.\n\nTrending\n\nDunes pour through the town\u2019s shattered windows and doorways\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

            "article_content": "The Red Planet has always been a subject of intrigue and fascination. Recent research led by Curtin University has added more fuel to this age-old curiosity. The scientists discovered what could possibly be the oldest evidence of hot water activity on Mars.\n\nThis discovery opens up possibilities that at some point in its mysterious past, Mars may have been a place where life could exist.\n\nHot water on Mars\n\nThe study focused on a zircon grain from the renowned Martian meteorite NWA7034, fondly known as Black Beauty. This tiny grain, although no larger than a grain of sand, holds secrets dating back billions of years.\n\nThe analysis of the 4.45 billion-year-old zircon grain revealed geochemical fingerprints of ancient water-rich fluids. These traces of the past suggest that hot water was once present on Mars.\n\nDr. Aaron Cavosie from Curtin\u2019s School of Earth and Planetary Sciences noted that this discovery opens new paths for understanding early Martian hydrothermal systems and the planet\u2019s past habitability.\n\n\u201cWe used nano-scale geochemistry to detect elemental evidence of hot water on Mars 4.45 billion years ago,\u201d said Dr. Cavosie.\n\nEarly conditions on Mars\n\nHydrothermal systems are vital for the development of life. They were crucial for life to flourish on Earth. Dr. Cavosie noted that the same essential ingredients for habitable environments were present on Mars during its early crust formation period.\n\nThe team utilized nano-scale imaging and spectroscopy to identify essential elements on the zircon grain, including iron, aluminum, yttrium, and sodium.\n\nThe presence and pattern of these elements, added during the zircon\u2019s formation billions of years ago, suggest that water was present during early Martian magmatic activity.\n\nThis intriguing discovery indicates that during the initial stages of the Red Planet\u2019s existence, conditions were conducive to the existence of water.\n\nResilience of Mars\u2019 crust\n\nThe study also highlighted the resilience of Mars\u2019 crust. Despite enduring massive meteorite impacts, causing upheaval of its surface, Mars still had water during the early Pre-Noachian period, which was before about 4.1 billion years ago.\n\nIn 2022, Curtin researchers studied the same zircon grain. They found that it had been \u201cshocked\u201d by a meteorite impact, marking it as the first and only known shocked zircon from Mars.\n\nImplications for life on Mars\n\nThe discovery of ancient hydrothermal activity on Mars significantly changes our understanding of the planet\u2019s potential for life. Hydrothermal systems could have created environments rich in chemical energy and nutrients vital for life.\n\nThe presence of warm, mineral-laden waters in Mars\u2019 crust could have served as a cradle for microbial communities, much like the hydrothermal vents on Earth harbor diverse ecosystems despite the absence of sunlight.\n\nThis implies that if life ever existed on early Mars, hydrothermal systems may have been havens, providing conditions to support some form of life.\n\nThe research offers valuable insights into planetary habitability within our solar system and beyond.\n\nFuture research directions\n\nThe revelations from the zircon grain continue to ignite curiosity and lay the groundwork for future Mars exploration missions.\n\nPlanetary scientists are eager to explore other ancient Martian rocks and meteorites that might hold additional clues about Mars\u2019 hydrothermal systems and geological history.\n\nMissions equipped with advanced technology could further investigate the surface and subsurface of Mars, searching for more evidence of past water activity and potential biological markers.\n\nThese future efforts could significantly enhance our understanding of the Red Planet and refine our search for life beyond Earth, spurring innovative technologies and methodologies in planetary science research.\n\nEarly Mars and its water activity\n\nThis recent study builds on previous research, taking us a step closer to understanding what early Mars was like.\n\nAccording to Dr. Cavosie, identifying the signs of water-rich fluids from the zircon\u2019s formation period provides geochemical markers of water in the oldest known Martian crust.\n\nThe research was conducted by scientists from Curtin\u2019s Space Science and Technology Centre, the John de Laeter Centre, and the University of Adelaide.\n\nDr. Jack Gillespie is the lead author of the paper detailing study, which is set to be published in the journal Science Advances.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?

            "article_content": "In 1905, a young American scientist named William Coolidge set to work on an ambitious assignment for his new job at General Electric: creating a better light bulb. The carbon filament used in Thomas Edison\u2019s world-changing invention wasn\u2019t very energy efficient. Scientists were experimenting with tungsten, which had the advantage of a higher melting point, but the metal wire was too brittle and broke easily.\n\nSeveral years later, after numerous trials, errors, and accidents\u2014by some accounts, a breakthrough occurred when the tungsten rod fell into liquid mercury pooling from the heating system\u2014Coolidge created \u201cductile tungsten,\u201d a more bendable form of the metal that ultimately became the wiring still found inside incandescent light bulbs today.\n\nEkin Dogus Cubuk, a research scientist at Google DeepMind, points to ductile tungsten as an example of how new materials can revolutionize existing technologies\u2014often after careful, laborious efforts riddled with unexpected twists and turns. More than 100 years after that landmark innovation, his team has created an AI tool that could transform the way scientists discover new materials. Much like ductile tungsten, any of these compounds could improve upon current materials and lead to next-generation electric vehicle (EV) batteries or better solar panels. \u201cMany materials discoveries involve a lot of trial and error, luck, and serendipity,\u201d Cubuk says. \u201cWith AI we hope to reduce the reliance on luck. We have the potential to accelerate each stage of the process, from discovery to development, with more accurate and scalable predictions.\u201d\n\nGNoME catapults materials discovery\n\nThe AI tool that Cubuk\u2019s team built is called GNoME (Graph Networks for Materials Exploration), and it has used deep learning to determine the structure of 2.2 million inorganic crystals. Of those, GNoME identified 380,000 materials that are stable at low temperatures, according to simulations. \u201cWe hope that having this information will help the community to catapult further breakthroughs in materials discovery and design,\u201d Cubuk explains.\n\nSince the public release of these crystals in 2023, scientists have been experimenting with AI-identified compounds in labs worldwide\u2014including three that were recently synthesized in Japan by researchers at Hokkaido University.\n\n\u201cThere is a wealth of AI knowledge, but currently there\u2019s a gap between translating those insights to material synthesis in the lab. This early research shows how we can bridge the gap to explore new materials more efficiently,\u201d says Akira Miura, an associate professor at Hokkaido University, who led the study.\n\nMeanwhile, GNoME independently identified hundreds of crystals that scientists had already discovered on their own as stable, including \u201cexciting\u201d superconductor candidates, according to Cubuk. Furthermore, hundreds of these crystals were independently synthesized by labs around the world. That\u2019s a strong signal that the new material candidates in GNoME\u2019s findings have real-life viability.\n\nGNoME was initially trained with data on crystal structures that is available through the Materials Project, an open-source reference that has been central to new materials discovery. Identifying the structure of a new material is just the beginning of what can be a long, intensive development process. The original idea of the Materials Project was to reduce invention time by focusing experiments on compounds with the most potential for success, according to founder and UC Berkeley professor Kristin Persson. That itself was a game changer from the days when Persson was a graduate student in the mid-\u201990s and had to comb through oversize tomes to look up a material\u2019s chemical structure and properties. In the laboratory, researchers would combine intuition with past results to inform their experimentation. \u201cThere were no recipes for it except in the researcher\u2019s brain,\u201d Persson says. \u201cThey would use their experience to make new materials, and it would take a long time.\u201d\n\nNot that long ago, it was relatively rare to be able to calculate a new material on the computer that was thermodynamically stable, explains Chris Wolverton, a professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern University. For one, the sheer magnitude of the required computational power was a hurdle. \u201cGoogle is particularly rich when it comes to computational time and power,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were able to\u2014in a very short order\u2014calculate the properties of several million compounds.\u201d\n\nThe availability of this vast data trove is opening up new possibilities to materials researchers, says Persson. \u201cThey\u2019re giving this body of work to the community and saying, \u2018Do what you want with it,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the new kid on the block in terms of the tools we have. If you\u2019re a materials company and not thinking of machine learning, you\u2019re behind, and Google put a brilliant spotlight on that.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean researchers are suddenly going to have piles of new materials cluttering their lab benches. The tool has identified crystals that computations predict will be stable under absolute zero, or about -273C\u2014an ideal condition in which particle motions come to a stop. A key question persists: Can these crystals be created in a stable form that won\u2019t change or decompose at room temperature? Myriad factors, including temperature and pressure, can influence whether a theoretical compound can exist in a form that would become, say, the next EV battery. Scientists will have to figure out the right experimental methods to create materials that will be useful in innovation. \u201cThat\u2019s the next giant challenge in this field: predicting synthesis recipes,\u201d Wolverton says.\n\nMaterials scientists explore next steps\n\nIndeed, the tremendous scale of the AI findings has spurred important conversations about the best way to identify and synthesize new materials. A researcher may spend an entire career conducting experiments on just a few compounds, a painstakingly slow and labor-intensive process. The key is finding a balance between creating AI-led possibilities and developing the known science, explains University of Liverpool professor Andy Cooper, whose research group focuses on ways to accelerate the discovery of functional materials: \u201cI think that\u2019s a challenge for the future. What is the right place to be on that spectrum?\u201d\n\nNew materials improve the foundations of modern life\n\nAt Google DeepMind, Cubuk envisions a future when new materials could reshape today\u2019s most exciting technologies\u2014from semiconductors to new power sources for supercomputers. As AI tools evolve, a key challenge is determining which potential materials best correspond to technologies and products, Cubuk explains. For example, knowing what criteria makes a good lithium-ion conductor helps researchers better identify the most promising candidates. Already, the GNoME team has identified 528 potential materials for batteries\u2014more than 25 times the number identified in a 2017 study, which was led by Austin Sendek, the CEO of Aionics, a technology company dedicated to designing high-performance batteries with AI.\n\nGenerative AI can predict the next big thing. As we exhaust what\u2019s known, we have to develop new ways to push boundaries, and this is one of those paths. Jakoah Brgoch, associate professor of chemistry at the University of Houston\n\nAI\u2019s contributions might also open up researchers\u2019 minds to unforeseen possibilities, says Jakoah Brgoch, an associate professor of chemistry at the University of Houston, whose work explores functional inorganic materials. Maybe the AI-suggested compounds aren\u2019t viable under current lab temperatures and pressure, for example; but what happens if you alter those variables? \u201cScience is often a slog,\u201d Brgoch says. \u201cThe hope and the hype is we don\u2019t have to go through this slog. Generative AI can predict the next big thing. As we exhaust what\u2019s known, we have to develop new ways to push boundaries, and this is one of those paths. Of course, experimentally validating these predictions is easier said than done.\u201d\n\nAccording to current industry wisdom, new material discovery requires, on average, at least 10 years of work and north of $10 million to $100 million. While the cost to build a factory is the same, what used to take weeks to simulate on a computer can now be done in seconds with AI, says Sendek.\n\n\u201cAI-based materials discovery methods will unlock unorthodox solutions that would have otherwise eluded human intuition, while also leading to fewer \u2018dead ends\u2019 that cannot be commercialized,\u201d says Sendek, pointing to the recent discovery by Aionics\u2019s AI system that adding a luxury perfume molecule to a battery\u2019s electrolyte could improve the battery\u2019s overall performance. Aionics is now actively testing this molecule in real-life batteries.\n\n\u201cMaking meaningful progress in materials innovation requires us to discover better materials faster and then get them to market in a fraction of the time.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The history of science is the history of eureka moments, from Newton\u2019s apple to Oersted\u2019s compass needle to Fleming\u2019s petri dish. For many people in and around the field of AI research, the past decade or so has been a succession of such moments, many of them described in this issue of Dialogues\u2014from revelatory research on protein folding to promising approaches to mitigating global warming (for a sense of the technology\u2019s influence on the way we learn, work, govern, and more, see the accompanying infographics).\n\nLila Ibrahim\n\nGoogle DeepMind, Chief Operating Officer\n\nCountry of origin: USA\n\nCurrently based: United Kingdom\n\nIn 2020, Google DeepMind achieved a seemingly impossible scientific breakthrough: our advanced AI system, AlphaFold, could now accurately predict protein structures in minutes, not years.\n\nI still remember that moment\u2014when I realized that all of our investment, iteration, and patience had delivered so much benefit for the world.\n\nProteins are life\u2019s building blocks. Understanding their structure is key to advancing drug discovery, food security, treatments for neglected diseases, and more. We\u2019ve used AlphaFold to map over 200 million proteins and made this knowledge freely available. Today, 2.2 million researchers across 190 countries use AlphaFold to tackle some of the biggest problems facing our world.\n\nAlphaFold is proof of AI\u2019s ability to advance scientific discovery, and we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of its extraordinary potential to benefit humanity.\n\nSa\u0161ka Mojsilovic\n\nGoogle, Senior Director, Researching Engineering AL/ML\n\nCountry of origin: Belgrade, Serbia\n\nCurrently based: USA\n\nThirty-five years ago, as a college junior, I took an introductory computer vision class. We scanned a black-and-white photograph and then coded an algorithm that analyzed the image and outlined objects in it. This made me think about how everything around us\u2014speech, music, written word, molecules, X-rays, weather, traffic\u2014can be understood as patterns. I realized that if we could teach computers to see, we could teach them to sense, hear, read, and reason; to identify cancer and diagnose disease, weave new molecules, predict crop yields and natural disasters\u2026Back then, computers were slow, data was scarce, and algorithms were simple, but I was in awe of what might one day be possible.\n\nPhil Venables\n\nGoogle Cloud, Vice President, TI Security & Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)\n\nCountry of origin: United Kingdom\n\nCurrently based: USA\n\nI realized AI had the potential to change the world when I saw how it could revolutionize cybersecurity. While attackers may use AI to their advantage, we are seeing firsthand how it is transforming defenders\u2019 capabilities. Traditionally, cybersecurity has faced the so-called defender\u2019s dilemma, where attackers only need to succeed once, while defenders must be vigilant every time. But now, with AI, we\u2019re seeing an increasing shift toward the defender\u2019s advantage. AI provides defenders with an invaluable edge, allowing them to analyze threats, detect vulnerabilities, and respond with unprecedented speed and scale. Like other groundbreaking technologies throughout history, AI brings both remarkable benefits and unforeseen risks\u2014but it ultimately empowers us to stay one step ahead, building a safer, more resilient digital world.\n\nMira Lane\n\nGoogle, Senior Director of Technology & Society\n\nCountry of origin: Canada\n\nCurrently based: USA\n\nI\u2019ve always believed that technology has the potential to change the world. Yet, as both an artist and technologist, I once thought the creativity industry might be immune to the massive types of disruption technology often brings. But when I saw AI being used in the role of a collaborator\u2014co-creating scripts, generating new imagery, and creating music\u2014I realized storytelling was also being transformed. The real magic happens when AI and human creativity combine across disciplines, allowing us to explore narratives in new and unexpected ways. What might happen when we can all express our inner creativity more easily? The world might suddenly open to new and amazing possibilities. Interdisciplinary collaboration between technologists, artists, and storytellers is now pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible, reshaping how we engage with the world through art and imagination.\n\nJustin Tranter\n\nSongwriter\n\nCountry of origin: USA\n\nCurrently based: USA\n\nI had two big wow moments while getting to play with Music AI Sandbox, from Google DeepMind and YouTube. The first was a fear\u2014the fear that if this was not handled properly, it would be yet another thing in our industry that harms songwriters. The second was hope: The tools are so magical that not only can it help human songwriters be more creative with new works, when done correctly it should also create a further revenue stream for songwriters\u2019 past work. There is a world where this is a win-win for songwriters.\n\nFr. Paolo Benanti\n\nTheologian; adviser to Pope Francis on AI and computer ethics; member, High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, United Nations\n\nCountry of origin: Italy\n\nCurrently based: Italy\n\nOne day, I returned to my convent and overheard a 90-year-old friar in the next room conversing with the smart speaker. The natural way in which he spoke to it, and the fact that he had found someone who was not bored with his repetitive questions about the weather, history, and current events, turned a light on in me: If AI could so easily enter the life of a man from the last century\u2014who does not even really know what this technology is, but who can interact usefully with computational power in a cloud thousands of miles away\u2014well, then, yes, AI was ready to change our daily lives.\n\nConnor Coley\n\nAssociate Professor of Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science, MIT\n\nCountry of origin: USA\n\nCurrently based: USA\n\nAround 2017, I was compiling the results of a human-benchmarking comparison to evaluate a new neural network model for organic chemistry: This model correctly predicted the experimentally confirmed product of a chemical reaction where 10 Ph.D.-level chemists could not! Given how quickly we were able to reach that level of performance, although it was not as significant of a milestone as AlphaFold would be several years later, I could then see the path to evermore capable AI helping us navigate the scientific process.\n\nAlondra Nelson\n\nHarold F. Linder Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study; former acting director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Biden-Harris administration; member, High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, United Nations\n\nCountry of origin: USA\n\nCurrently based: USA\n\nIn developing what would become the White House\u2019s 2022 Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, we spent nearly a year meeting with any member of the American public with a perspective to share on AI\u2019s impact on society. This included a multiracial group of high-school students from across the country who called themselves Encode Justice and advocated for human-centered, responsible uses of AI. These students spoke with a remarkable urgency about their concern that facial recognition technology would soon be required for them to access their school buildings, their classrooms, and parts of their curriculum. As policy makers, we had been thinking about the impact of social media and algorithmic amplification on young people\u2019s mental health. But for these students, AI enabling a state of persistent surveillance was top of mind. The generation that is the most likely to see the greatest harms or gains from AI is flashing a yellow warning light for us.\n\nSeydina Moussa Ndiaye\n\nSenior Lecturer at Cheikh Hamidou Kane Digital University; member, High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, United Nations\n\nCountry of origin: Senegal\n\nCurrently based: Senegal\n\nWhen I first discovered the methods of artificial intelligence during my first year of my master\u2019s degree, in 1994, I immediately realized that this was in fact the ultimate goal of computer science. My eureka moment came to me when, in 1997, during my doctoral thesis, I obtained results that were more accurate than those obtained by agronomic experts for the cultivation of winter wheat, by applying reinforcement learning methods combined with a genetic algorithm.\n\nLerrel Pinto\n\nAssistant Professor of Computer Science, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University\n\nCountry of origin: India\n\nCurrently based: USA\n\nMeaningful change in life requires physically unburdening people from mundane, laborious, or simply undesirable tasks, allowing us to focus on what truly matters. While robotics has traditionally lagged behind other AI fields like natural language processing, the past year has brought a breakthrough in what we call zero-shot capabilities for robots: A robot can now be placed in an unfamiliar environment, such as your home, and successfully perform complex tasks\u2014like moving small objects or opening cabinet doors\u2014with encouraging accuracy, despite never having been specifically programmed for that setting. This quiet robot revolution will revolutionize our daily lives, bridging the gap between virtual intelligence and a more physical, real one.\n\nVirginia Dignum\n\nProfessor of Computer Science, Ume\u00e5, Sweden; member, High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, United Nations\n\nCountry of origin: Portugal\n\nCurrently based: Sweden\n\nI realized AI was not going to change life as we know it when existential risks became a central issue in discussions about its future. AI will not fundamentally change life; instead, it will push us to recognize the importance of our human existence. AI capabilities highlight the irreplaceable value of human creativity, empathy, and moral reasoning. The responsibility for AI\u2019s impact rests with us, not with the technology. AI doesn\u2019t happen to us\u2014we make it happen.\n\nTilman Becker\n\nDirector, RICAIP Centre for Advanced Industrial Production at the Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics, and Cybernetics (CIIRC)\n\nCountry of origin: Germany\n\nCurrently based: Czech Republic\n\nFor me, there\u2019s been more than one eureka moment: The first was 40 years ago when I was starting to learn about AI as a student, then some 30 years ago, when I spoke in German into an early prototype of the Verbmobil system I worked on at DFKI [a German research center] and got a spoken English translation seconds later (spooky at the time, even though I knew exactly what the system was doing). Then again over 10 years ago, when I realized that AI technology had become so pervasive that it is an important tool in the fourth Industrial Revolution. And finally, one day in late 2022, when using ChatGPT for the first time: Even with all its limitations, seeing a system generate flawless, eloquent language left me flabbergasted.\n\nSayan Chakraborty\n\nCo-President, Workday; former member, National AI Advisory Committee\n\nCountry of origin: India\n\nCurrently based: USA\n\nI first built artificial neural networks (ANNs) in 1989, during my graduate work at MIT: I wanted to apply ANNs to robots designed to repair satellites. However, the neural network I trained to control a robotic arm failed miserably, and I set aside ANNs as an interesting curiosity. But by 2012, deep-learning ANNs, more sophisticated than those I had worked with, were winning competitions in image recognition and hinting at greater potential. Graphics processors (GPUs) designed for gaming were being used to radically improve performance. But it wasn\u2019t really until late 2020, after a discussion with a friend about the Google paper titled \u201cAttention Is All You Need,\u201d that everything clicked. The missing puzzle pieces\u2014powerful GPUs, the attention-transformer approach, cloud computing, the availability of vast training datasets on the internet\u2014were finally all here, and I knew that this revolution was happening now.\n\nAyanna Howard\n\nDean of Engineering, The Ohio State University; member, National AI Advisory Committee\n\nCountry of origin: USA\n\nCurrently based: USA\n\nIn the early 2000s, I worked on developing a neural network approach to enable future Mars rovers to navigate long distances over hazardous terrain. After countless field trials on Earth, during which my robot would sometimes exhibit quite strange, if not erratic, unsafe driving behavior, I finally thought, Why should a robot learning to drive be so different from teaching a teenage driver? That was my eureka moment. I realized that AI\u2019s value proposition should be centered around its synergistic and symbiotic relationship with humans and that if it continued to be designed around this fundamental concept of people first and foremost, it would change the world.\n\nRahaf Harfoush\n\nDigital anthropologist and author; member, High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, United Nations\n\nCountry of origin: Syria/Canada\n\nCurrently based: France\n\nI was experimenting with AI\u2019s ability to change the way we interact with ideas and was testing different personas, each one pulling expertise from various domains to answer my questions. During that process, I ended up accidentally creating what I started calling a \u201csuper partner\u201d\u2014a blend of the wisdom and compassion of a Zen monk, the sharp mind of a strategist, the frameworks of a therapist, and the practical ability of a coach, who could help me put it all into practice. I was shocked by how well it worked.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just giving me answers; it was synthesizing advice in a way that felt personal and multidimensional. This was a completely new way for us, as humans, to not just access knowledge, but to interact with it, remix it, and blend it in ways that sparked new connections. That\u2019s what really lit up my brain\u2014the realization that AI could help us create, think, and problem-solve by using the breadth of human intellect in a way that simply wasn\u2019t possible before.\n\nPaula Goldman\n\nChief Ethical and Humane Use Officer, Salesforce; member, National AI Advisory Committee\n\nCountry of origin: USA/Singapore\n\nCurrently based: USA\n\nIt was the holiday season in 2022, and while I expected most of my conversations with friends to revolve around the festivities, I was surprised when they all wanted to talk about AI\u2014how it might impact their law practice or their journalism career. While tracking AI milestones, like detecting early signs of cancer and testing self-driving cars, is second nature for me, I knew something had tipped when friends who had never expressed interest started asking questions. We are at the precipice of a profound shift in how we interact with technology at work, seeing it evolve from a tool to a dynamic partner. While we all know this shift comes with both promise and peril, it can\u2019t be overstated how crucial it is to keep people at the helm of this transformation.\n\nRichard Zhang\n\nDistinguished Professor of Computer Science, Simon Fraser University\n\nCountry of origin: China\n\nCurrently based: Canada\n\nThe world\u2019s leading machine learning conference, NeurIPS, recently accepted more than 4,000 papers. This is in addition to well over 5,000 top-tier papers in computer vision and graphics, all in my fields of research. Even if only 1 percent of these papers are closely related to my work, I\u2019ll have to sift through a sea of publications to find and read them. There cannot be that much truly innovative research out there, being produced at this volume and pace\u2014much of it must be \u201cartificial,\u201d or at least superficial. While I still cannot fathom ever using AI to write one of these papers, it suddenly occurred to me that I may have to rely on AI to find, read, and summarize the latest research results to stay well informed.\n\nHolger Hoos\n\nAlexander von Humboldt Professor of AI, RWTH Aachen University (Germany); Professor of Machine Learning at Universiteit Leiden (the Netherlands); Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (Canada)\n\nCountry of origin: Germany\n\nCurrently based: Germany\n\nAround 2013, I was working with a team within a large electrical utility in Canada that was struggling, because of the immense computational cost involved, to set prices for their surplus of 100 percent renewable energy. My research team and I had started to develop AI methods for reducing the computational effort involved in solving this kind of formal-reasoning problem, but never at scale. With their experts, we ultimately were able to combine methods from automated reasoning, machine learning, and optimization that solved the energy-pricing problem at scale, literally overnight, without the use of a large compute cluster. I realized what a difference AI could make, not merely economically, but also in terms of tackling the grand challenges of our time\u2014in this case, a problem closely related to climate change.\n\nCraig Ramlal\n\nHead of the Control Systems Group, University of the West Indies at St. Augustine; member, High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, United Nations\n\nCountry of origin: Trinidad & Tobago\n\nCurrently based: West Indies\n\nI remember being taken aback when I learned that language models could construct rational sentences. It meant that, for the first time in human history, there was another entity, one that was not human, capable of creating (approximating) logical thought across many domains. It also occurred to me that we may greatly rely on these systems at some point in the future, giving them more autonomy and trusting their decisions\u2014fundamentally altering how humanity interacts with and thinks about technology. I remain hopeful that the minds behind AI\u2019s success, the original thinkers, will guide its research, utility, and adoption toward the greater good.\n\nJimena Sof\u00eda Viveros \u00c1lvarez\n\nMember, High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, United Nations; Commissioner at the Global Commission on Responsible Artificial Intelligence in the Military Domain; AI Expert at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\n\nCountry of origin: Mexico\n\nCurrently based: Mexico\n\nSince the development of the Blue Brain Project in 2005, I\u2019ve been both fascinated by and concerned with technological developments and their legal and ethical implications. I realized then that\u2014like the discovery of gunpowder and the splitting of the atom\u2014artificial intelligence was going to be the defining technology of our generation and those to come. Based on my experience in peace and security, I foresaw AI would pose grave, perhaps even existential, risks to humankind in these domains if not properly and globally governed, which is why I am truly committed to this endeavor. Ultimately, our common goal must be to ensure that we can harness AI\u2019s opportunities fairly and equitably while mitigating its risks for the benefit and protection of all of humanity."

It's important to be selective with the companies that you add to your portfolio and ensure that you only put cash into investments that align with your overall investment priorities, risk tolerance, and long-term goals.\n\nYou should also only put cash to work that you can leave in your portfolio for a few years, not funds that you might soon need for bills or other financial obligations. On that note, if you're looking for top-notch growth stocks to buy right now and have $1,000 available to invest, here are two names to consider.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter!

Eli Lilly\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has been the darling of pharmaceutical stocks in the last 12 to 18 months, with shares rocketing upward as the popularity of its GLP-1 drugs has propelled revenue and earnings. Bear in mind, this is one of the oldest healthcare companies in the world, with a lineup of top-selling drugs across a range of disease categories that target everything from various cancers and cardiovascular ailments to endocrine disorders and neurological conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024 alone, shares roared upward to the tune of about 62%. After the company reported its earnings for the third quarter of 2024, shares took a double-digit nosedive as investors responded negatively to a few key points, including a slight pullback in full-year guidance. The company also reported financial figures that were slightly below what Wall Street had expected.\n\nIn terms of its full-year guidance, where Eli Lilly was targeting revenue for the 12-month period in the $45.4 billion to $46.6 billion range, the company is now projecting that it will deliver in the ballpark of $45.4 billion to $46 billion. Its Q3 revenue was around $800 million below what analysts had aimed for.\n\nThat being said, a closer look is warranted, and the long-term outlook for this business is anything but dismal. Revenue in Q3 2024 rose 20% year over year to $11.4 billion. The company sold rights for its olanzapine portfolio in Q3, featuring products used to treat ailments such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. If you exclude revenue from this portfolio, Eli Lilly's top line actually jumped 42% on a year-over-year basis, which is a bit more than the 36% growth it reported in the second quarter. The company also reported net income of approximately $970 million in Q3.\n\nTirzepatide, which is the main active ingredient in its top-selling drugs Mounjaro (for diabetes) and Zepbound (for weight loss), is being studied by Eli Lilly across multiple other disease areas. For example, positive phase 3 trial data from a 176-week study of tirzepatide demonstrated a 94% reduction in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults with pre-diabetes who are obese or overweight.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnother first-of-its-kind study initiated by Eli Lilly has been studying tirzepatide in adults with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and obesity. In this phase 3 trial, tirzepatide reduced heart failure symptoms and physical limitations while lowering the risk of worsening heart failure events by 38%. Risk of hospitalization for heart failure was also reduced by 56% in trial patients taking tirzepatide. In short, the future revenue and profit opportunities from tirzepatide may be in the very early innings.\n\nIn Q3, sales of Mounjaro rose more than 121% year over year to $3.1 billion, while Zepbound (which was just approved last November) raked in $1.3 billion in sales. This was despite negative effects for both drugs cited by Eli Lilly that were caused by inventory decreases in the wholesaler channel. Blockbuster cancer drug Verzenio generated $1.37 billion in sales in the quarter, up 32% from one year ago, while sales of autoimmune disease drug Taltz jumped 18% to $879.6 million.\n\nWhile investors appear to be particularly reactionary in the current environment, that can present an opportunity for those with a sufficient buy-and-hold horizon to take a slice of the action. While Eli Lilly doesn't trade at a cheap valuation by any means, its annual dividend of $5.20 and steady increase to its payout can augment total investor returns. Investors who want to become part-owner in a top healthcare business with a steady global footprint may be remiss to overlook this quality stock.\n\n2. Monday.com\n\nMonday.com (NASDAQ: MNDY) is a low-code and no-code platform that helps organizations build the work management tools and software applications they need to ensure business operations run smoothly. The company derives its revenue from monthly or annual subscription agreements that it enters into with customers who use its cloud-based platform.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nMonday.com's software enables everything from project management and collaboration to helping keep tools and files in a single location for easy access. Clients with little to no coding experience can leverage its platform to develop customized workflow apps featuring boards, charts, and other important automation solutions.\n\nCompanies like Canva, Lionsgate, and Coca-Cola are just a handful of the big names on Monday.com's client roster. Investors have been particularly optimistic about Monday.com's performance recently, with shares skyrocketing to the tune of about 50% over the trailing 12-month period.\n\nAs always, share price is never a reason to buy (or sell) a stock. You need to look at the underlying business, its drivers and detractors of growth, its financial performance, its industry, and its long-term growth runway to gain a clear picture of whether it's a wise fit for your portfolio. In the case of Monday.com, the company has only been in business since 2012, so it's still in the relatively early stages of its potential growth story.\n\nManagement estimates that the company operates in a large and growing total addressable market, which could hit a valuation of $150 billion by the year 2026. The diverse range of solutions that Monday.com's platform offers allows it to target various segments of its overall market opportunity, including the $30 billion customer relationship management (CRM) software market.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Monday.com is doing quite well. Its third-quarter revenue rose 33% from the year-ago period to $251 million, and the company officially surpassed the $1 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR) mark. Its overall net dollar retention rate (NRR) increased to 111%, while NRR for customers with more than $100,000 in ARR was 115%.\n\nThe number of paid customers with more than $100,000 in ARR jumped 44% from one year ago. Meanwhile, the company's second-largest customer, which is an unnamed international technology company, more than doubled its seat count to 60,000 from 25,000. Although Monday.com is not profitable on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), cash flow is another core profitability metric to consider.\n\nFrom a free cash flow perspective, the company raked in $82.4 million of free cash flow, while net cash provided by operating activities was $86.6 million in Q3. While investors may need a certain level of risk tolerance to invest in software stocks, this resilient business looks like a compelling addition to a well-diversified portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

            "article_content": "This Tuesday, November 26, marks the beginning of Mercury retrograde and it will last until Sunday, December 15. This will be the last time this year that this planet will show such behavior. Traditionally, a Mercury retrograde occurs about three times a year and is a phenomenon feared in astrology. In its apparent backward motion, Mercury will move from 22 degrees to 6 degrees in the sign of Sagittarius.\n\nAstronomically, it is an optical illusion in which it appears that this planet is moving in the opposite direction in its orbit. While astrologically, Mercury is a planet to which an energy is attributed that affects individuals. It is associated with aspects such as communication, travel and technology. The presence of Mercury retrograde has to do with a connection with the past and encourages introspection.\n\nElon Musk's 'Starship' explodes on test flight\n\nAstrologers indicate that this transit is not bad in itself, but rather opens up possibilities for learning and working on different aspects of life. It is recommended for deep reflection, to slow down routines and to become aware of reality.\n\nAdditionally, astrologers recommend taking advantage of this time to learn to say no, express our boundaries without fear and cultivate patience to close the year in a harmonious way to better receive the coming year.\n\nWhich zodiac signs will be affected during Mercury retrograde?\n\nThis time, Mercury retrograde will occur in the sign of Sagittarius, symbolizing a dispute between logic and spirituality, generating doubts between beliefs and the decisions we make. Because the energy is focused on introspection, experts also recommend avoiding making big decisions until this influence is over.\n\nThe signs that will have the greatest influence from this Mercury movement are:"

            "article_content": "The rapidly growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has given shares of many companies a big boost in the past couple of years, and that's not surprising as this technology is expected to impact the global economy in a big way.\n\nAccording to management consultancy giant PwC, generative AI could contribute a whopping $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 by driving productivity gains and product enhancements that will lead to improved consumer demand. Not surprisingly, several companies are trying to make the most of this opportunity by integrating AI-focused offerings into their products and services.\n\nAre You Missing The Morning Scoop? Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe good part is that many of these companies have witnessed a nice bump in their businesses thanks to AI, a trend that's likely to continue considering that the technology is currently in its early phases of growth. That's the reason why buying and holding on to solid AI stocks for a long time to come could turn out to be a smart move. Such a strategy will allow investors to capitalize on this disruptive trend while also benefiting from the power of compounding.\n\nThis article considers two AI stocks that seem a good fit for investors looking to build a million-dollar portfolio. AI adoption is already having a positive impact on both these companies, and they could deliver outstanding gains to investors in the long run thanks to the lucrative markets they operate in.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nSoftware platforms provider Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) went public just over four years ago in September 2020. The stock has shot up a remarkable 544% since then (as of this writing), with most of the gains arriving since last year.\n\nSomeone who invested $1,000 in Palantir stock when it went public would be sitting on more than $6,400 right now. More importantly, this red-hot stock has room for more growth in the long run as it has started benefiting from the booming demand for AI software platforms.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe company's revenue in the third quarter of 2024 increased 30% year over year to $726 million, along with a 43% increase in adjusted earnings to $0.10 per share. Palantir's growth has kicked into a higher gear as the company's top line increased at a slower pace of 17% in the same quarter last year. The solid demand for Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which allows users to integrate generative AI solutions into their operations to make them more effective, is playing a central role in driving this accelerated growth.\n\nPalantir CEO Alex Karp said in his recent shareholder letter that AIP has \"transformed our business.\" The robust demand for this AI software platform led to impressive growth in the company's customer base and deal size. For instance, Palantir's customer count increased by 39% year over year in Q3, an improvement over the 34% jump it witnessed in the same quarter last year.\n\nAdditionally, the company closed 104 deals valued at $1 million or more in the previous quarter, up from 80 in the same quarter last year. This combination of an increase in the company's customer count along with the bigger deals that it is signing allowed Palantir to build a sizable revenue pipeline.\n\nThe company's remaining deal value at the end of the previous quarter was $4.5 billion, up by 22% from the prior year. This metric refers to the \"total remaining value of contracts as of the end of the reporting period.\" Meanwhile, Palantir's existing customers are also increasing their use of the company's services. This is evident from the net-dollar retention rate of 118% in Q3, a nice jump from the 107% reading in the same period last year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPalantir said this metric is calculated by dividing the trailing-12-month revenue at the end of a quarter by the trailing-12-month revenue recognized in the year-ago period by those same customers. So, a reading surpassing 100% suggests that Palantir's existing customers are spending more on its offerings. This also explains why Palantir's adjusted operating margin has jumped by 11 percentage points in the first nine months of 2024 to 37%, leading to outstanding growth in its earnings.\n\nMore importantly, market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) estimates that the AI software platforms market could hit $153 billion in revenue in 2028 from just $28 billion last year. So, there is still a lot of room for Palantir to achieve further growth in its revenue and earnings in the long run. This is why investors looking to buy an AI stock that could help them construct a million-dollar portfolio can still consider this software specialist before it flies higher.\n\n2. Arm Holdings\n\nBritish technology company Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) went public in September last year, and its shares have more than doubled since then, with outstanding gains of 102% as of this writing. However, a closer look at the company's business model will show that it still has a lot of upside to offer.\n\nAfter all, Arm's intellectual property (IP) is used by chipmakers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to design chips. Arm licenses its chip designs to customers for a fee and also receives a royalty from them for each chip manufactured and sold using its IP. The good part is that Arm enjoys healthy market share across multiple semiconductor end markets.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor instance, the company says 99% of smartphone application processors are manufactured using its designs. What's worth noting here is that even though the smartphone market has been growing at a slow pace, Arm's royalty revenue from this segment has been rising at a nice clip. More specifically, Arm's smartphone royalty revenue increased 40% year over year in Q3 2024, significantly outpacing the mid-single-digit jump in smartphone shipments during the same period.\n\nArm management pointed out that the stronger growth in smartphone royalty revenue was driven by the growing adoption of its Armv9 architecture, which carries a higher royalty rate over the previous architecture. Armv9 now accounts for 25% of Arm's total royalty revenue, suggesting that it still has a lot of room for growth in the future.\n\nA big reason why Armv9 adoption should gain momentum is because the company designed this architecture to tackle AI workloads. This explains why the architecture has been used by Apple to design the chipset for its AI-capable iPhone 16 lineup. With the demand for generative AI smartphones set to increase at an annual rate of 78% through 2028 to 912 million units at the end of the forecast period, as per IDC, it won't be surprising to see more companies turning to Arm to design their AI chipsets.\n\nMoreover, Arm points out that Armv9 is gaining traction in the cloud computing market as well. Nvidia, for instance, developed its Grace AI CPU (central processing unit) using the Armv9 instruction set. Again, this is another area that could drive outstanding growth for Arm as the demand for AI chips is set to grow at an incredible pace in the long run.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAll this explains why analysts are forecasting an acceleration in Arm's earnings growth. The company expects to finish the current fiscal year with $1.55 per share in earnings, which would be a 22% improvement over the previous fiscal year's reading of $1.27 per share. However, the growth forecast for the next couple of years is stronger.\n\nARM EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year Chart\n\nARM EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts.\n\nSo, just like Palantir, there is a good chance that Arm could maintain its impressive stock market rally thanks to the healthy AI-fueled growth in its earnings. Also, considering the critical role that Arm plays in the global chip market, it looks like an ideal fit for a million-dollar portfolio because of the business model that has helped it build a solid moat.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "article_content": "PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\n\nThe MSI Roamii BE Lite is a two-piece Wi-Fi 7 mesh system that offers multi-gig connectivity and free parental control and network security software. At $299.99 it\u2019s one of the more affordable ways to expand a Wi-Fi 7 network, but it lacks a 6GHz radio band and doesn't support 320MHz channels. You'll get both, and superior performance, with our Editors' Choice winner in the category, the TP-Link BE63 BE10000 Whole Home Mesh Wi-Fi 7 System.\n\nDesign and Features: Twin Plain Pillars\n\nThe Roamii BE Lite system comes with two identical white triangular minitower nodes that measure 9.4 by 4.3 by 4.7 inches (HWD) and provide a total of 5,800 square feet of coverage. Each node has a 2.5GbE WAN/LAN port and two 1GbE LAN ports, but unlike the TP-Link BE63, they do not offer any USB ports. You can use the LAN ports for wired backhaul or let the Wi-Fi handle it.\n\nThe nodes are equipped with four internal antennas and are powered by a 1.5GHz quad-core CPU, 2GB of DDR4 RAM, and 256MB of flash memory. They're a Wi-Fi 7 system that supports Multi-Link operation (MLO), 4K QAM, beamforming, MU-MIMO, Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) data transmissions, and 240MHz channel bandwidth, but unlike most Wi-Fi 7 systems this one does not offer a 6GHz radio band, nor does it support 320MHz channels. It's a dual-band system that can reach theoretical data rates of up to 688Mbps on the 2.4GHz band and up to 4,323Mbps on the 5GHz band.\n\nIn addition to your regular network, you can create a guest network, an IOT network for smart home devices, and a child network that lets you restrict internet usage times with a separate SSID and password.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSpeaking of children, the Roamii BE Lite comes with free parental control and network security software powered by Trend Micro. Dubbed FortiSecu, the suite offers age-based web filtering, online time limits, and alerts when an inappropriate website is visited. Network security tools will scan all connected devices, block known ransomware and harmful links, and send alerts when a vulnerability is detected.\n\nThe Roamii system can be managed using the mobile app or with a web console. The former opens to a dashboard screen that is loaded with information, including a network map, upload and download speeds, a QR code that makes it easy to share Wi-Fi credentials, and separate panels for IOT, Child, and Guest networks. Each of these panels has an On/Off button for enabling or disabling the specific network, and when you tap the panel you can change security and access settings for the network. Tapping any node on the network map lets you see what devices are connected and the average upload and download speeds for that node.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen are Dashboard, Security, Parental, and Advance Setting buttons. The first brings you back to the dashboard from wherever you are in the app, and the Security button opens a screen where you can request a scan of all devices, see which devices are online, view device vulnerabilities, and view blocked attacks, threats, and ransomware attempts. The Parental button opens a screen where you can create user profiles, assign web filters, view blocked website attempts, check network limitation status, and see how many inappropriate apps have been used for each user.\n\nAdvance Settings include Wi-Fi and LAN settings, IPTV/LAN options, VPN Server settings, system management tools, LED management, and a link to the web console.\n\nInstallation and Setup: No-Fuss Mesh\n\nInstallation was easy. I downloaded the app, tapped Let's Get Started, and used my phone's camera to scan a QR code that was taped to the back of the node. I followed the instructions to connect the LAN cable to my modem and to the 2.5GbE port on the node, connected my desktop PC to a 1GbE LAN port on the node, and powered everything up.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhen the LED began flashing blue, I tapped Next and connected my phone to the Roamii's Wi-Fi. The app immediately found the router, so I gave it a location and tapped Connect. I had to manually connect my phone to the router's SSID and enter the password, select DHCP as my connection type, and create an admin account and password.\n\nI then confirmed the Wi-Fi SSID and password and tapped Next to create the new network. After a minute or so, I was prompted to connect to the new network and add another node. I plugged in the satellite node, and when the LED turned white, it was automatically added to the network. After a quick firmware update, the installation was finished.\n\nTesting the MSI Roamii BE Lite Mesh System\n\nIn our throughput performance tests, the Roamii BE Lite couldn't keep pace with our Editors' Choice-winning Wi-Fi 7 mesh system, the TP-Link Deco BE63. This isn't surprising as it lacks several features that you get with the Deco, such as a 6GHz band, support for 320MHz channels, and a 2.5GbE LAN connection to our testbed. (The Roamii system has a 2.5GbE port, but it is designated as a WAN connection.)\n\nThe Roamii router node scored 937Mbps in the close-proximity test, while the TP-Link Deco BE63 router node scored 2,288Mbps. In the 30-foot test, the Roamii router managed 524Mbps to the Deco's 780Mbps. The Roamii satellite node managed 561Mbps in the close-proximity test versus the TP-Link node's score of 1,688Mbps. At a distance of 30 feet, the Roamii node delivered 441Mbps, and the Deco BE63 node delivered 950Mbps.\n\nWe test wireless signal strength using an Ekahau Sidekick 2 diagnostic device paired with the company's Survey software. Together, they generate a heat map that displays Wi-Fi signal strength throughout our test home. The circles on the heat map represent the router and node locations, and the colors represent signal strength. Dark green indicates the strongest signal, lighter yellow a weaker one, and gray indicates a very weak or no measurable signal. As the heat map illustrates, the Roamii system did an excellent job of delivering strong Wi-Fi signals throughout the home.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor the most part, the app worked as intended, but it should be noted that it generally took more than a minute for it to apply any settings changes, and occasionally, it shut down and had to be restarted.\n\nVerdict: Wi-Fi 7 Not Quite Turned Up to 11\n\nWith the MSI Roamii BE Lite, you get a reasonably priced Wi-Fi 7 mesh system that delivers excellent signal coverage and comes with free parental control and network security software. What you don't get are 6GHz transmissions, 320MHz channel bandwidth, and multi-gig LAN, all of which are necessary for the type of killer Wi-Fi 7 performance that you get with more expensive systems. If you want to take advantage of all that Wi-Fi 7 has to offer, our top pick remains the TP-Link Deco BE63, which offers significantly faster performance as well as multi-gig LAN and USB connectivity. You can find it for about $100 more than the MSI kit."
