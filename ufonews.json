            "article_content": "The internet has been left divided over an 'egg-shaped craft' recorded during a UAP retrieval operation after the video was aired on TV for the first time.\n\nNewsNation aired the footage that 'clearly showed' the object dangling in a sling from a helicopter on Saturday night.\n\nThe alleged craft was about 20ft long and resembled the UAP encountered by the Navy off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects, NewsNation reported.\n\nIt was pointed out in the video that the object had no markings, being 'perfectly smooth', and no 'visible' means of propulsion or way to look inside.\n\nAfter the segment aired, Redditors had mixed opinions on the footage's veracity, although many were impressed by what they saw.\n\n'This is pretty cool. I don\u2019t know what you guys were expecting of a nighttime retrieval. This is actually more clear than I thought it would be. It helps to lower expectations,' one wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'I had a feeling that the video would be somewhat ambiguous. I'm not sure this is gonna move the needle without more substantiating evidence. I think it's great, personally, but this isn't gonna convince Joe Taxpayer.'\n\n'Probably is real. But you aren\u2019t going to convince people with this. To claim this is any different from any other sketchy video already seen (outside the gimbal & go fast) is a stretch & hardly going to make anybody new sit up & take notice. Too bad,' another wrote.\n\nNewsNation aired the footage which 'clearly showed' the object dangling in a sling from a helicopter\n\nThe outlet was told the craft was about 20ft long. It's said to resemble the UAP encountered by the Navy off the east coast of the US in 2015, suggesting a connection between these unidentified objects\n\nHowever, other users were much less convinced.\n\n'Well, the video quality is better than I expected, I'll give them that. The object itself? With no frame of reference to judge size, it could be an actual chicken egg as far as I can tell,' one Redditor wrote.\n\nAnother said: 'This video could not have been cheap to make with the cost of eggs these days!'\n\n'No reference to size, this could literally be a chicken egg on a string, with helicopter noises edited in,' a third added.\n\n'This shows nothing. This is not earth shattering, redefining man kind evidence they were promising,' another wrote.\n\nA fifth commented: 'I knew the footage was not going to be good. But what exactly am I looking at here? An egg on the end of a fishing rod?'\n\nOther users pointed out some potential issues with the credibility of the footage.\n\n'What kind of terrain is this supposed to be on? Something about the scaling and shadow feels off,' one questioned.\n\n'Well, the video quality is better than I expected, I'll give them that. The object itself? With no frame of reference to judge size, it could be an actual chicken egg as far as I can tell,' one user wrote\n\nAnother eagle-eyed user said: 'If this was in the desert how is the helicopter not blowing up dust and sand like crazy.'\n\n'So, like, wouldn't they drop off the egg thing on a truck or something or a base? Why are they dropping it off on the ground of what appears an empty desert field?' another wrote.\n\n'No prop wash? I could fake this in my house right now in an hour,' a Redditor added.\n\nAnother user replied by pointing out the lack of sway in the rope.\n\n'So, they retrieved and filmed just an egg-shaped thing. It wasn't flying, it wasn't doing anything. What a load of utter nonsense this is,' one user said.\n\nThe video, which was kept in the dark until its bombshell release, is the latest video footage that has made the rounds online in recent weeks seemingly depicting a UFO.\n\nWidespread interest and coverage of the subject surged after drones were seen flying across New Jersey last month.\n\nOffering a solution to the mystery, Tucker Carlson made a shocking claim that the mysterious drones were controlled by a Chinese mothership satellite.\n\nTucker Carlson discussed the mysterious drones on his show this week, saying he was told the objects were controlled by China\n\nThe White House repeatedly stated that the drone sightings are not a foreign adversary, pose no threat and are not part of a US military operation\n\nThe first sightings appeared over the Picatinny Arsenal in Rockaway and President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster in November, followed by thousands more in the skies.\n\nWhile the US government was quick to dismiss claims they were foreign adversaries, Carlson claimed he was told otherwise.\n\nHe said, 'an intel person' told him that the drones 'were in fact Chinese,' explaining the US government took down a Chinese satellite 'that was a command and control satellite for these drones.'\n\nCarlson appeared to be hinting at a Beijing-operated satellite known as GaoJing 1-02 which fell from space on December 21.\n\nAstronomers tracking such devices confirmed the Chinese satellite re-entered Earth's atmosphere above New Orleans and headed north towards Mississippi, Arkansas and Missouri before burning up in the atmosphere.\n\nBut Carlson claimed it was 'taken down by the US government.'\n\nHe made the claims while speaking with independent journalist Michael Shellenberger, who heard a similar explanation for the drones.\n\n'Somebody told me that that the military got one of the orbs, opened it up and it was Chinese,' Shellenberger said.\n\nThe White House repeatedly stated that the drone sightings - which coincidentally began on November 18 - are not a foreign adversary, pose no threat and are not part of a US military operation.\n\nBut Carlson said his inside source told him that 'the belief was the Chinese government was sending the following message, 'We're moving on Taiwan.''"

According to a new report with NewsNation, U.S. Air Force veteran and whistleblower Jake Barber claims he was contracted as a helicopter pilot to retrieve downed craft.\n\nIn the report, he\u2019s sharing a video and claiming that he has retrieved nonhuman vehicles that seem to go against all physics. That or it\u2019s Mork from Mork and Mindy in his giant egg rolling on the ground under a tarp. You be the judge.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\n\u201cI saw an egg, a white egg,\u201d Barber said to the outlet. \u201cIt\u2019s inconsistent with anything I\u2019d ever seen before. I can also tell you that the reaction by my team, we all knew we were dealing with something extraordinary.\n\nPlay video\n\n\u201cOver the last couple years, it\u2019s been confirmed to me by ranking members of the UAP task force that what we were working with that night was, in fact, NHI (nonhuman intelligence) and it was not a unique experience,\u201d they added.\n\nThe report was touted by musician, filmmaker and all-around talented guy Flying Lotus on Twitter. Setting the tone for how people might be absorbing these new revelations.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s the big day huh? Lets see,\u201d he wrote alongside an alien and UFO emoji. \u201cI hear we will see \u2018paradigm shifting\u2019 evidence of a UFO crash retrieval today for the first time from a first hand witness.\u201d\n\nThis is only the latest revelation out of the disclosure we\u2019ve seen in recent years. The end of 2024 into the new year saw plenty of questions about drones across multiple areas on the East Coast. We\u2019ve also heard about the \u201cnonhuman\u201d intelligence during the Congressional testimony from the likes of Lue Elizondo and David Grusch.\n\nIf this turns out to be a Robin Williams clone gone awry, I might just have to hang it up. Life will have officially drifted into being a Family Guy gag."

(WVVA) - The Campbell-Flannagan-Murrell House was built in the late 1800s, serving as a home for generations of a Hinton family, as well as as a general store for a time.\n\nNow, it stands as a museum, and a part of Summers County history. On Jan. 18, the museum partnered with Appalachian Ghosts Tours to offer a unique experience of history, culture, and potentially paranormal spirits with guided tours and an investigation.\n\nAttempting to encounter spirits can require some technology, and as the Executive Director of Appalachian Ghost Tours, Mark Covey, explained, special equipment as well as ordinary objects can get the job done.\n\n\u201cWe have EMF meters that will go off if, like, an electric spike gets near you. We have REM pods that basically do the same thing, but they stay in a stationary area and they will make a lot of noise,\u201d said Covey. \u201cWe have cat balls that, you know, you wouldn\u2019t think would be anything, but they will just be sitting in there on something solid and they will start to light up.\u201d\n\nAlthough the house is simply a museum by day, even those familiar with the home have experienced unexplained happenings.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been times when I\u2019ve been in this house by myself and heard footsteps and nobody\u2019s been in the house, so yeah, I think that there\u2019s something going on, but I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s malicious in any way,\u201d said Carol Jackson, President of the Board of Trustees over the Campbell-Flannagan-Murrell House Museum.\n\nThis event is part of an ongoing effort for more paranormal tourism in Appalachia, bringing attention to smaller communities that are rich with folklore and paranormal history.\n\n\u201cSouthern West Virginia is absolutely overflowing with the haunted stories, the paranormal, there is an energy here like no other and there is a history here like no other,\u201d explained Pamela Huff, a member of Appalachian Ghost Tours.\n\nFor more information on the museum, you can view their website or Facebook page, and to keep up to date with Appalachian Ghost Tours, click here.\n\nCopyright 2025 WVVA.

            "article_content": "In a groundbreaking discovery that sounds like science fiction but is absolutely real, researchers have found that your eyes contain hidden signals that could predict your risk of having a stroke. This revolutionary finding isn\u2019t just another medical study, it\u2019s a potential game-changer in how we approach stroke prevention and early detection.\n\nThe incredible science behind retinal fingerprints\n\nScientists have identified 29 unique vascular indicators in your retina that serve as warning signs for stroke risk. These tiny blood vessels in your eyes create patterns as unique as your fingerprints, and their condition can reveal crucial information about your overall health. Within these indicators, 17 are density-related markers that can increase your stroke risk by up to 19% when altered. These changes are like tiny red flags waving in your eyes, signaling potential danger before other symptoms appear. The remaining indicators focus on the size and twistedness of blood vessels, with changes potentially raising stroke risk by nearly 20%. Think of these vessels as tiny roads in your eyes, their condition reflecting the health of your entire cardiovascular system.\n\nWhy this discovery is absolutely mind-blowing\n\nTraditional stroke risk assessments often involve invasive procedures and expensive tests. But this new method requires nothing more than a specialized photograph of your eye. The implications are enormous, especially for communities where access to advanced medical testing is limited or cost-prohibitive.\n\nThe beauty of this breakthrough lies in its simplicity. During a routine eye exam, doctors can capture detailed images of your retina and analyze them for these crucial indicators. It\u2019s painless, quick, and could potentially save countless lives through early detection.\n\nThe fascinating connection between your eyes and brain\n\nYour retina isn\u2019t just a window to your soul, it\u2019s actually an extension of your brain. Every tiny blood vessel in your eye tells a story about the health of your brain\u2019s blood vessels. This connection explains why changes in your retinal vasculature can predict stroke risk with remarkable accuracy.\n\nWhat makes this discovery revolutionary\n\nThe research team analyzed data from over 45,000 participants. This massive study revealed that retinal analysis combined with basic demographic information could predict stroke risk as accurately as traditional methods.\n\nWhat\u2019s truly remarkable is how this technology could transform preventive healthcare. Imagine walking into your local eye clinic and getting a comprehensive stroke risk assessment during your regular eye exam. This isn\u2019t just convenient, it\u2019s revolutionary for global health care accessibility.\n\nThe global impact of this breakthrough\n\nThis discovery could dramatically change how we approach stroke prevention worldwide. In regions where advanced medical facilities are scarce, a simple eye scan could become a lifesaving tool. The technology could help identify at-risk individuals years before they might experience a stroke, allowing for early intervention and prevention strategies.\n\nHealthcare providers are particularly excited about implementing this technology in primary care settings. It could become as routine as checking blood pressure, but with the potential to reveal much more detailed information about cardiovascular health.\n\nWhat this means for the future of healthcare\n\nThe implications extend far beyond stroke prediction. Researchers believe similar retinal analysis could help predict other conditions like heart disease and dementia. This opens up endless possibilities for early detection and prevention of various diseases through simple eye examinations.\n\nAs technology continues to advance, we might see artificial intelligence systems analyzing these retinal images in real-time, providing instant risk assessments and recommendations. This could revolutionize how we approach preventive healthcare, making it more accessible and effective than ever before.\n\nThe discovery of retinal vascular fingerprints as predictors of stroke risk isn\u2019t just a scientific breakthrough, it\u2019s a glimpse into the future of medicine. It shows us that sometimes the most powerful diagnostic tools are hidden in plain sight, waiting to be understood and utilized. As this technology develops and becomes more widely available, it could transform how we approach disease prevention and ultimately save countless lives through early detection and intervention."

            "article_content": "By Chloe Mari A. Hufana, Reporter\n\nA STRICTER monitoring and enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with labor standards is needed amid a \u201cdim\u201d employment outlook, particularly in the country\u2019s service and agriculture sectors, a labor leader said.\n\nA recent International Labour Organization (ILO) report on insufficient global employment growth mirrors the situation in the Philippines, where persistent decent work deficits in the service and agriculture sectors are attributed by the Federation of Free Workers (FFW) to rampant contractualization, low wages, and unsafe working conditions.\n\n\u201cThe outlook remains dim, particularly when considered alongside the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) recent report. It estimates that 14% of the workforce \u2014 around 5 million Filipino workers \u2014 are at risk of displacement this year due to artificial intelligence (AI) and climate change,\u201d FFW President Jose Sonny G. Matula told BusinessWorld in a Viber message over the weekend.\n\nThe ILO\u2019s World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2025, released last week, found employment growth globally remained \u201ctoo weak\u201d to significantly impact lingering decent work deficits.\n\nWhile employment growth remains steady, various factors are testing the resilience of labor markets worldwide, it added.\n\n\u201cThe lack of faster global productivity growth is partly linked to the failure of structural change to move people out of agriculture into manufacturing and services,\u201d it noted.\n\n\u201cGiven the poor working conditions in much of farming outside advanced economies, this also means that working poverty and informality have not benefited from people moving out of agriculture to better-paying jobs in industry and services,\u201d it added.\n\nIndividuals in informal employment, particularly in agriculture and other sectors like wholesale and retail trade, often face irregular income and lack access to social protection, it added.\n\n\u201cIn this context, the vigorous exercise of the Department of Labor and Employment\u2019s (DoLE) inspection and visitorial powers under the Labor Code is essential,\u201d Mr. Matula said.\n\n\u201cStrengthened monitoring and enforcement mechanisms will ensure that employers comply with labor standards, while the Employment Plan should adapt to rapidly changing labor market dynamics, including those influenced by technology and climate change,\u201d he added.\n\nIn 2024, global employment grew alongside the expanding labor force, maintaining the global unemployment rate at a steady 5%, consistent with the level recorded in 2023, the ILO noted.\n\nHowever, this growth remains insufficient to address persistent decent work deficits as young workers continue to face high unemployment rates, around 12.6%, with little sign of improvement, it added.\n\nLabor Secretary Bienvenido E. Laguesma said the department conducted \u201cextensive national consultations,\u201d culminating in the upcoming 10-year Trabaho Para sa Bayan (TPB) Plan to address weak job growth.\n\n\u201cThrough these initiatives, we have identified several key areas of intervention that align with the goals of the TPB Plan and aim to address the challenges of regional employment disparities, particularly in rural areas,\u201d he told BusinessWorld in a Viber message over the weekend.\n\n\u201cAgriculture remains a cornerstone of rural employment, and we are committed to transforming this sector to boost productivity and job creation,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted the Labor department aims to introduce technology-enabled farming practices, climate-resilient methods and value-added processes into agribusiness through the Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives will not only create more jobs but also enhance the sustainability and profitability of rural livelihoods,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Philippine Statistics Agency\u2019s (PSA) November 2024 Labor Force Survey, the agriculture sector experienced the highest year on year job loss, with 1.99 Filipinos leaving the sector.\n\nThe agency attributed the loss to typhoons.\n\nRURAL WORKFORCE\n\nAccording to Mr. Laguesma, DoLE is empowering local government units (LGUs) to spearhead rural development by supporting them with investment strategies, microfinance for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and infrastructure projects under the Build Better More program.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives will ensure that rural areas become hubs for inclusive economic activity,\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition, DoLE is collaborating with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and local institutions, prioritizing tailored skills training.\n\nPrograms will focus on green skills development, digital upskilling and vocational training to prepare rural workers for opportunities in sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, and renewable energy, he noted.\n\n\u201cOur Public Employment Service Offices (PESOs) are key to facilitating job placement and matching in rural areas,\u201d he added, noting that digitalization and enhancing labor market intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe aim to make employment services more accessible and effective, enabling rural job seekers to connect with opportunities tailored to their skills and aspirations,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe labor chief also added the department is committed to fostering sustainable job opportunities in agriculture, eco-tourism and clean energy. These green initiatives will ensure long-term job creation while protecting environmental resources.\n\nSocial safety nets for rural workers are critical, he noted, adding the ILO has been helping DoLE in achieving these initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe will broaden coverage of social protection programs to include informal workers, addressing vulnerabilities and providing stability during economic transitions,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBy prioritizing rural job creation and addressing regional disparities, we aim to build a resilient and equitable labor market where every Filipino has access to quality employment.\u201d"

These can include minimum spends, multibuy offers, or product-specific promotions (i.e. 10% off selected tablets). You can view all associated requirements by clicking \u201cView terms and conditions\u201d below your code.\n\nIf this does not solve your issue, you can contact our customer service team by emailing coupons.tomsguide@futurenet.com. Make sure to let us know which coupon you were trying to use and which page this was listed on, and we\u2019ll be in touch to help as soon as possible.\n\nHow we make money\n\nTom\u2019s Guide makes money from coupons through a commission-based model. We have agreements in place with each retailer on our site - for every purchase made using one of our coupons or deals, we earn a small percentage of the order total back in commission.\n\nThanks to this model, we can save our customers money without charging them a thing.

            "article_content": "In a dramatic development on Thursday, SpaceX's Starship rocket mission ended abruptly when the spacecraft exploded minutes after launch from Texas. The incident, which involved an upgraded Starship carrying a test payload, prompted airlines to reroute flights over the Gulf of Mexico as debris scattered, marking a setback for Elon Musk's rocket program. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, in coordination with Turks and Caicos officials, is investigating the fallout, though no injuries have been reported.\n\nIn Belgium, scientist Clement Martin is collaborating with federal police to create a groundbreaking scent mimicking the smell of dried bones, helping sniffer dogs locate long-missing remains. This innovation follows Martin's earlier work isolating the scent of decomposing flesh, now essential in training cadaver dogs across Belgium.\n\nMeanwhile, archaeological explorations in Pompeii have uncovered an opulent private bath complex, providing insights into the affluent lifestyle of the Romans before the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The newly unearthed site features hot, warm, and cold baths that could accommodate up to 30 guests, adorned with Greek mythological themes, showcasing the luxury of that era.\n\n(With inputs from agencies.)"

            "article_content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is an incredible technology, and we've only scratched the surface of its potential. Currently, it's being used as a program on the side of normal work, but it's about to enter a new phase: Agentic AI. Agentic AI, often called AI agents, involves setting up software programs to do tasks that humans normally do. This next phase in implementing AI is critical, as it will allow those at the cutting edge to do more with fewer resources.\n\nOne of the leaders in agentic AI is Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). The software company is making a heavy push to promote and integrate agentic AI, and it also has one of the best platforms for implementing it.\n\nSalesforce's platform is ripe for agentic AI integration\n\nSalesforce makes customer relationship management (CRM) software. CRM is an incredibly broad sector but can generally be summarized as a business interaction with a potential customer from the marketing stage to after-sale support. There's a lot that happens between those two points, and Salesforce software is there to offer support along the way.\n\nMany customer interactions can be automated by AI agents, which is why agentic AI is such a massive trend for Salesforce. As with most software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, the more add-ons you have from the base software package, the more expensive it gets. This unlocks another milestone for the generative AI trend; we're reaching a point where many companies are starting to monetize their AI investments.\n\nSalesforce's CEO and co-founder, Marc Benioff, is extremely bullish on agentic AI. During the company's 2024 Dreamforce conference, he stated, \"This is what AI was meant to be.\" That's a big statement, but the ability for companies to become more efficient and free their workers up to do tasks that require original thinking will be a huge change for many in the workforce.\n\nHowever, does this one technology have the ability to drive Salesforce's stock to new heights?\n\nSalesforce needs this new technology to kick-start growth again\n\nSalesforce is a mature software company that started to shift from growth-at-all-costs to maximizing profitability a few years ago. However, its sales growth has been a bit slow, by most software company standards, over the past few quarters. In its fiscal 2025's third quarter (ended Oct. 31), revenue was up 8% year over year to $9.44 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) were $1.60 versus $1.26 a year ago -- a 27% gain.\n\nEPS growth outpaced revenue growth because of Salesforce's rising margins. During last year's third quarter, Salesforce posted operating margins of 17.8%. This year, it delivered 20.6% operating margins. This will be a key trend to watch, as some of the most profitable software companies can reach profit margins of up to 30%. It will likely be some time before Salesforce can reach that level (if it can), but shareholders will be elated if it does.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is concerned about collaborations between large cloud providers and leading developers of generative artificial intelligence (AI). It is particularly concerned about Microsoft's investment of USD 13 billion in OpenAI and the collaboration between Google and Anthropic. The latter two are actually competing with each other with their Gemini and Claude models, but are also strategic partners. In these cases, the FTC sees an increased risk that the younger AI companies could be completely bought up or otherwise taken over by the technology giants in the near future. The authority is also skeptical about the billion-euro investment by cloud market leader Amazon in Anthropic.\n\nAnzeige\n\nThe relevant report published by the antitrust watchdog on Friday \"sheds light on the question of how partnerships between large technology companies lead to lock-ins\", explained FTC boss Lina Khan. Such collaborations could deprive other start-ups of important AI research results, which could undermine competition. More and more companies are relying on generative AI, Khan explained. Regulators and policy makers must therefore remain vigilant to ward off business strategies \"that undermine open markets, opportunities and innovation\".\n\nThe authors of the report shed light on aspects of the structure of partnerships between cloud providers and AI developers. For example, they look at the equity and revenue-sharing rights as well as certain advisory, control and exclusivity rights that Microsoft & Co. receive as part of their financing. The competition watchdogs are also concerned about obligations that require OpenAI and Anthropic to spend a large proportion of their partner's investments on their cloud services. The deals also include access to \"large amounts of computer resources at reduced prices\", intellectual property rights relating to the latest AI models and certain financial and training data. In addition, there would be opportunities to expand current products \u2013 such as the integration of AI applications into cloud offerings or other solutions.\n\nEU antitrust watchdogs also have questions\n\nFurthermore, the FTC is critical of the ability of collaborations to influence access to computer resources and highly skilled workers in a way that could massively impair competition. It also criticizes the potential of the deals to increase contractual and technical switching costs for AI developer partners. This would make it more difficult for OpenAI and Anthropic to find other cloud service providers. It remains to be seen what the new leadership of the FTC under the second Trump administration, which takes office next week, will do with the results.\n\nFormer EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in the summer that Microsoft's investment in OpenAI was not yet a case for a review under merger control rules. However, she said that both companies would be asked questions under antitrust rules \"to understand whether certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative impact on competitors\". The EU executive also wants to scrutinize the impact of the agreement between Google and Samsung to pre-install Gemini Nano on certain Samsung devices. There is a risk that tech giants could make it difficult for smaller developers of AI models to \"reach end users\".\n\n(axv)"

He also recommended exploring roles in non-tech industries like finance and healthcare, which are increasingly hiring for AI and automation projects. Freelancing, he noted, was another avenue to maintain skills, expand networks, and gain experience while job hunting.In a similar situation, another techie sought advice online after being laid off in September. Having returned to India after working abroad and boasting nine years of experience in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and data, he faced challenges in the local job market, including rejections or significantly lower salary offers. The lack of preparation in competitive coding practices like DSA and Leetcode further added to his struggles. The tech professional expressed frustration and embarrassment after three months without an offer.Online responses suggested exploring opportunities abroad, especially in regions like the Middle East, where AI and tech roles are in demand. Others advised accepting lower-paying offers temporarily while continuing to search for better roles. Some users expressed surprise at the challenges faced by AI and ML professionals, questioning whether the demand in these fields was dwindling or if entry into data science had become increasingly competitive."

Putin of Russia, his hostility toward Ukraine and his resistance to U.S. military aid to Kyiv, analysts expect any settlement he seeks to be favorable to Moscow. Vice President-elect JD Vance has suggested letting Russia keep the 20 percent of Ukraine it has illegally seized through aggression and forcing Ukraine to accept neutrality rather than alignment with the West, a framework echoing Russian priorities.\n\nAsked by email why Mr. Trump had not fulfilled his campaign promise to end the war before his inauguration, Karoline Leavitt, Mr. Trump\u2019s incoming White House press secretary, did not respond directly, but instead repeated that he will make it \u201ca top priority in his second term.\u201d\n\nSince his November election, Mr. Trump met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and has spoken about meeting with Mr. Putin after his inauguration."

            "article_content": "A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip came into effect on Sunday, following a delay of nearly three hours. The truce halts a devastating 15-month-long conflict that has caused widespread destruction and loss of life. After months of intricate and tense negotiations, the agreement aims to provide a reprieve from the violence that has gripped the region, while addressing the political and humanitarian crises exacerbated by the ongoing war.\n\nDespite the delayed start, residents and medical workers in Gaza reported no new fighting or military strikes after about 30 minutes before the ceasefire was implemented. However, Israeli airstrikes and artillery attacks killed 13 Palestinians in Gaza between 06:30 GMT, when the ceasefire was originally set to begin, and 09:15 GMT, when it was finally enacted, according to Palestinian medics.\n\n#WATCH | Delhi | Reuven Azar, Israeli Ambassador to India, says, \"The ceasefire Israel signed off to is the first phase of a gradual deal which has the potential of bringing back our hostages and also making sure Hamas won't be ever able to massacre Israelis like it did on\u2026 pic.twitter.com/fBZwWi7jNP Also Read Air Canada plane catches fire during landing at Halifax airport, incident happens hours after fatal South Korea plane tragedy \u2013 Watch \u2018IITian Baba\u2019 Abhey Singh expelled from Juna Akhara for disrespecting his guru; he responds Indian Railways\u2019 expansion in West Bengal: 43 rail projects spanning 4,479 km underway in the state, says Ashwini Vaishnaw FPIs turn net sellers after two weeks of buying, withdraw Rs 976 crore amid global uncertainty January 19, 2025\n\nReasons for the Delay\n\nIsrael\u2019s military blamed Hamas for the delay, citing the Palestinian militant group\u2019s failure to provide a list of hostages to be released as part of the agreement. Hamas attributed the delay to \u201ctechnical\u201d reasons, though it did not elaborate further. A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, indicated that the delay was due to mediators requesting 48 hours of \u201ccalm\u201d before the ceasefire, but Israeli strikes had made it difficult to send the list of names.\n\nAlso Read Israeli PM Netanyahu delays Gaza ceasefire until Hamas releases hostage list\n\nTwo hours after the deadline, Hamas announced that it had sent the names of the hostages to be released, with Israeli officials confirming the receipt. The three hostages named for release on Sunday were Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher, and Emily Damari, although Israel did not immediately confirm their identities.\n\nDetails of the Ceasefire Agreement\n\nThe ceasefire deal follows months of on-again, off-again negotiations, involving mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and the United States. The deal, which is seen as a potential step toward ending the Gaza war, is structured in three stages. The first stage will last six weeks and will involve the release of 33 of the remaining 98 hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe first hostages to be released will include women, children, and the elderly, and they are expected to be transferred through the Red Cross. In return for each of the hostages released, Israel will free 30 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas will coordinate with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to determine the meeting points inside Gaza for the handover.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement, though a step forward, does not yet guarantee a full resolution to the conflict. The ongoing war, which erupted after Hamas launched attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023, has claimed thousands of lives, with nearly 47,000 Palestinians killed in the conflict. The war has also exacerbated tensions throughout the Middle East, drawing in Iranian-backed militant groups and causing diplomatic isolation for Israel.\n\n(With Reuters Inputs)"

            "article_content": "Adani Energy Solutions Ltd, India's largest electricity transmission and distribution company, has won two new transmission projects, helping swell its order book to \u20b954,700 crore -- more than three times of the work order it had at the start of current fiscal in April 2024.\n\nIn October-December 2024 -- the third quarter of the fiscal year April 2024 to March 2025 (FY25), AESL won two new transmission projects worth \u20b928,455 crore in Rajasthan, related to the renewable energy park, Jefferies said in a report.\n\nThe orders include the \u20b925,000-crore Bhadla-Fatehpur HVDC project, which is AESL's largest order win till date.\n\nThese order wins have pushed up the company's market share in TBCB (tariff-based competitive bidding) orders to 24 per cent, from 17 per cent in the second quarter.\n\nAESL's current order book now stands at \u20b954,700 crore, as compared to \u20b917,000 crore in the beginning of the current financial year. This is the highest order book amongst all private sector transmission companies.\n\nAlso read: ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel to commission 2 million tonne auto grade steel capacity by March\n\nDuring the quarter, the company commissioned one transmission line, adding over 1000 circuit kilometres to its network, which stands at 26,485 cKM and 84,286 MVA of transformation capacity. As of December 2023, these were 20,422 cKM and 54,661 MVA.\n\nIn distribution, the company supplies power to over 3 million customers in Mumbai metropolitan and Mundra SEZ regions. During the quarter, Mumbai market saw a 3 per cent year-on-year increase in power sale to 2.57 billion units, while the Mundra market saw a 30 per cent rise to 236 million units.\n\nThe company has applied for a parallel distribution license in Navi Mumbai, Kutch, and Ghaziabad-Jewar-Bulandshahr area.\n\n\"We believe AESL should see 16 per cent revenue CAGR and 62 per cent profit CAGR in FY24-27E, driven by locked-in growth in both transmission and distribution business,\" Jefferies said. \"\u20b927,300 crore projects are targeted to be commissioned by October 2026\".\n\nIn smart metering, AESL was the lowest bidder in the cancelled smart metering tender of 8.2 million meters in Tamil Nadu. This order quantity is not part of AESL's existing pipeline of 22.8 million meters.\n\nAESL said it will participate in the rebidding when it comes up.\n\nJefferies expects AESL to add 4.5 million smart meters by the end FY25 and 10 million by FY26, of which 7 million will come from existing contracts and balance from new wins.\n\nAESL's capital management program prioritises reducing volatility in interest costs through long-tenure bonds. The company is also refining its debt management strategy to match the life of respective assets at fixed rates as much as possible.\n\n\"AESL's management says it believes in minimising volatility in its asset base across parameters: debt is being refinanced and raised to match the life of the respective asset at a fixed rate as far as possible; vendor back-to-back arrangements to limit the impact of commodity price changes; and land studies for faster project commissioning,\" the report said, adding downside risks include inability to maintain interest rate; and market share loss."

Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations far beyond the capabilities of traditional computers.\n\nThis transformative technology has the potential to revolutionize diverse sectors, including medicine, materials science, and artificial intelligence (AI). Underscoring this point, a recent McKinsey & Co. research report projects that quantum computing could generate a whopping $1.3 trillion in economic value by 2035.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free \u00bb\n\nA swirling, colorful, abstract image representing the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nJust as the internet boom created giants like Amazon and Google, quantum computing could give rise to a new generation of industry-leading companies, offering early investors the potential for extraordinary gains. Imagine a future with personalized medicines, revolutionary materials, and supercharged AI -- all made possible by quantum computing.\n\nLet's take a closer look at two quantum computing stocks that could represent once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for early shareholders.\n\nTrapped-ion quantum computing leader\n\nIonQ (NYSE: IONQ) is emerging as a potential leader in the commercialization of quantum computing through its trapped-ion technology approach. Unlike traditional superconducting quantum competitors, IonQ's architecture operates at room temperature and demonstrates strong qubit connectivity, with the company's Forte system delivering 36 algorithmic qubits at 99.9% fidelity -- marking significant performance advantages that could translate into a formidable competitive moat as the technology matures.\n\nWhile some quantum computing companies focus on the number of physical qubits, IonQ uses \"algorithmic qubits\" to represent the computational power available after accounting for error correction and other factors that affect algorithm performance. This metric aims to provide a more practical measure of a quantum computer's ability to solve real-world problems.\n\nBeyond the core technology, IonQ's execution has been notable. The company has consistently beaten aggressive roadmap timelines, secured a major $54.5M Air Force Research Lab contract, and established partnerships with heavyweights like pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca and engineering simulation software leader Ansys.\n\nWhile quantum computing stocks are notoriously speculative, IonQ's manufacturing facility opening and modular multicore architecture as a potential path to scaling suggest the company has a credible shot at capturing a meaningful share of the vast and potentially unparalleled quantum computing market.\n\nSuperconducting quantum pioneer\n\nRigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) takes a distinctive approach to quantum computing, focusing on superconducting technology and vertical integration. Unlike room-temperature trapped-ion systems, Rigetti's architecture leverages established semiconductor manufacturing processes at the company's dedicated Fab-1 quantum foundry, potentially offering advantages in scaling and gate speeds in the years ahead.\n\nWhile qubit count is one progress metric, Rigetti emphasizes gate fidelity as a key performance metric. The company's latest Ankaa-3 system achieves 99% median iSWAP gate fidelity and 99.5% median fidelity for fSim gates -- critical benchmarks that reflect the system's ability to perform reliable quantum operations with minimal errors, which is necessary for practical applications.\n\nBeyond the technical foundations, Rigetti's execution showcases strategic positioning. The company has secured its role as the quantum hardware provider for the U.K.'s National Quantum Computing Centre, established partnerships with financial leaders like HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, and maintains strong ties with the Air Force Research Lab and Fermilab's SQMS Center.\n\nWhile quantum computing remains an emerging field with significant technological hurdles, including maintaining qubit coherence, Rigetti's full-stack approach and innovative multichip architecture, combined with flexible deployment options through major cloud platforms and the QCS Direct cloud service, suggest the company is well positioned to compete in the evolving quantum computing landscape.\n\nA quantum computing revolution\n\nAs quantum computing advances from research labs toward commercial reality, IonQ and Rigetti demonstrate the potential technological paths that could make quantum computing a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity. Each company combines innovative architectures with strategic partnerships and clear commercialization strategies that could provide paths to capturing market share.\n\nWhile the technology remains highly speculative and faces significant technical hurdles, companies that successfully scale their systems while maintaining high performance could deliver unprecedented returns. As these potential quantum leaders emerge, investors must monitor technical progress, partnership momentum, and execution against stated roadmaps.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

            "article_content": "Fundamental research in cryptography that\u2019s used worldwide to facilitate internet banking, e-commerce services, and secure messaging systems is now taking root in India as well.\n\nThe principal goal of those developing or using cryptographic systems is to improve system security. Cryptography \u2014 from the English roots of \u201chidden writing \u2014 is the name for techniques that secure information by converting plain text into ciphertext. It is concerned with the creation and use of encrypted messages that only the sender and the receiver can understand and which a malicious actor who interferes with the communication can\u2019t.\n\nSending secret messages isn\u2019t new. Archaeologists have unearthed clay tablets made by the ancient Mesopotamians in which they wrote down cryptic formulae to make ceramic glazes. In the first century BC, the Roman dictator Julius Caesar used the eponymous Caesar cipher to relay messages of strategic value to his generals.\n\nMore recently, many Polish codebreakers fled their country after Adolf Hitler invaded it in 1939 to work with reputed British mathematicians, including the father of modern computing Alan Turing, to crack Germany\u2019s famed Enigma cryptosystem. Turing\u2019s work in particular established much of the foundational theory for modern algorithmic computing.\n\nScientists have devised many sophisticated methods to prevent adversaries from cracking secret codes and gaining unauthorised access to sensitive information. These methods achieve their goals by using algorithms and protocols to protect some data\u2019s confidentiality, integrity, authenticatability, and non-repudiation.\n\n\u2018Hard\u2019 problems\n\nCryptographic algorithms convert messages in ways that make it very difficult, very expensive or both to decode them. A common way to achieve this has been to place some sensitive information behind the answer to a very difficult problem. An agent can access the information by solving the problem, so the harder the problem, the more inaccessible the information.\n\n\u201cHence the search for harder and harder problems \u2014 for instance, even those that quantum computers may find hard to solve,\u201d R. Ramanujam of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, said.\n\nAs computational techniques evolve, particularly with advancements in quantum computing, the interplay between complexity and cryptography will continue to be a crucial area of research and development, he added.\n\nModern cryptographic systems are built on problems that demand far too many resources to be solved.\n\n\u201cAs they say in the crypto community, if your cryptosystem is broken, either a spy is dead or a million dollars is missing,\u201d Ayan Mukherjee, an assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, said. \u201cSuch is the seriousness of the effect of a broken cryptosystem. Thus, oftentimes, people use the old and the trusted to secure their communications.\u201d\n\nThis is also why, he added, \u201cThe field of cryptography is very slow-moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a close connection between complexity theory and cryptography, hence many [researchers] work on these connections, clarifying notions and building finer techniques,\u201d Ramanujam said.\n\nAreas where Indian researchers are working extensively include communication complexity (the amount of communication required to complete a computational task), proof complexity (the computational resources required to prove or disprove statements), and algebraic coding theory (using algebra to encode and decode data).\n\nLocks and keys\n\nThe goal is to make sure an adversary, especially one with enormous computational resources, can\u2019t crack the code. At the heart of any cryptosystem is the key: a secret value an algorithm uses to encrypt or decrypt data.\n\nThe Caesar cipher is a simple example. It works by mapping the existing alphabet to one where the starting letter is offset by some number of letters. This number is the key. For example, if the key is 14, the encrypted alphabet begins with the letter O (the 14th letter) rather than A. Thus the words FIGHT FOR ROME become TWUVH TCF FCAS.\n\nWhen the sender encrypts data with a key, only someone who knows the key can decrypt the message and read it. More sophisticated systems use two keys \u2014 one each for the sender and the receiver \u2014 and map them in a separate secret way.\n\nA famous example is public-key cryptography, which is used to secure information over the internet. The receiver uses a single algorithm to generate two keys called the public key and the private key, and shares the public key with the sender. Any message the sender encrypts with the public key can be decrypted by the private key.\n\nResearchers prefer the algorithms that generate keys to be one-way functions, a name in mathematics for functions that are simple to use but hard to crack. In cryptography, this means they can be used to easily encrypt messages but can\u2019t be cracked without knowing the key. As Ramanujam put it, the challenge is like protecting a house with a strong alarm system that the house\u2019s residents can still use without training.\n\nSome one-way functions are very difficult to crack and thus very secure \u2014 but which also take a long time to decrypt messages. This is one of the principal reasons mining for bitcoins has become a very energy-intensive process. The bitcoin system uses a one-way function that has required more computational resources to decrypt messages as the size of its blockchain has increased.\n\nThis is why some cryptography researchers in India and abroad are working on simplifying the decryption side in particular. Researchers are also considering whether shorter proofs (of the hard problems) can be used to verify the integrity of data in artificial intelligence and large language models.\n\nCryptography isn\u2019t just a mathematical or academic curiosity but is of considerable practical interest, Yael Kalai, whose work on proofs won her the 2022 Turing Award, told the 11th Heidelberg Laureate Forum in September (the author was in the audience). \u201cIn today\u2019s world, the biggest problem we have to solve is trustworthiness,\u201d she said.\n\nSince researchers have solved the problem of authentication and security in communications, she added, the current problem is computation.\n\n\u201cPeople are computing things for us. How do we know that they are computing correctly? How do we certify the huge and often crazy computations people are coming up with? That is a huge new research problem now.\u201d\n\nPossibility of disruption\n\nTwo research areas that could disrupt current cryptographic systems with significant economic and social consequences are homomorphic encryption and quantum information technologies, per a recent paper by the Organisation of Economically Developed Countries (OECD).\n\nHomomorphic encryption is a cryptographic method that allows certain calculations to be performed on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first and without accessing the secret key. The result of such computations remains in encrypted form and can be revealed later, when necessary. According to the paper, this technique could surmount the problem of processing encrypted data without decrypting it first, which increases risk.\n\nSecond, a mature quantum computer could easily break some encryption methods widely used today. Some researchers are thus working on algorithms that can resist attacks powered by a quantum computer, an enterprise called quantum resistant cryptography (QRC). In fact marrying cryptography with quantum physics paves the way for encryption technologies based on the laws of quantum physics, which can be more convoluted than mathematical concepts alone.\n\nResearchers worldwide have been working on QRC since 2006, including in publicly funded research projects in the European Union and Japan. In India, Mukherjee\u2019s group at IISER Pune, and those at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the Raman Research Institute (RRI), both in Bengaluru; the Centre for Development of Telematics, New Delhi; and at Pondicherry University are working on it as well.\n\n\u2018A huge deal\u2019\n\nCryptography research in India is taking off in other aspects, too, catching up with that in the European Union, the U.S., and China. The National Quantum Mission the Cabinet approved in 2023 includes a research hub for quantum communication. The mission is to enable satellite-based secure quantum communications between ground stations over 2,000 km, long-distance secure quantum communications with other countries, inter-city quantum key distribution over 2,000 km, and multi-node quantum networks, among other outcomes.\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation is also planning to launch a satellite with ultra-secure quantum communication capabilities.\n\nIn July, a team of Indian scientists from RRI, IISc, IISER Thiruvananthapuram, and the Bose Institute in Kolkata published a paper describing a way to generate true random numbers that are crucial to making secure private keys and nearly unhackable passwords.\n\n\u201cThis new method offers the enhanced protection we all need in our daily lives, by using truly random numbers to generate keys that will be used to encrypt the passwords,\u201d the Department of Science & Technology said in a statement.\n\nApart from the Ministry of Science & Technology, major government funders for cryptography research in the country include the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Department of Telecommunications.\n\n\u201cThe present status of quantum cryptography is to build quantum-secure cryptosystems,\u201d Mukherjee said. \u201cIt\u2019s based on the idea that, in the near future, we will have quantum computers. When that happens the current cryptosystems will fail. This is a huge deal.\u201d\n\nThe consequences will also affect India\u2019s cryptography policy. According to a recent study commissioned by the Thales Group, the volume of sensitive data in the cloud could surge from 51% of all organisational data to 68% by 2027. As more data enters and lives in the cloud, \u201cencryption techniques for data at rest, in motion, and in use are becoming more pervasive, evolving into a standard practice for protecting cloud-resident sensitive information against emerging cyber threats,\u201d the report said.\n\nThere is widespread data loss as well: the report said almost three-fourths of all organisations have faced multiple data breaches in the past year, foremost due to inadequate encryption. Some 71% initiated formal cryptographic programmes and 81% have dedicated encryption teams.\n\nT.V. Padma is a science journalist in New Delhi."

This is what it really means\n\nGetty Images (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nStargazers will be treated to a rare alignment of seven planets on 28 February when Mercury joins six other planets that are already visible in the night sky. Here's why it matters to scientists.\n\nPeer up at the sky on a clear night this January and February and you could be in for a treat. Six planets \u2013 Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune \u2013 are currently visible in the night sky. During just one night in late February, they will be joined by Mercury, a rare seven-planet alignment visible in the sky.\n\nBut such events are not just a spectacle for stargazers \u2013 they can also have a real impact on our Solar System and offer the potential to gain new insights into our place within it.\n\nThe eight major planets of our Solar System orbit the Sun in the same flat plane, and all at different speeds. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, completes an orbit \u2013 a year for the planet \u2013 in 88 days. Earth's year, of course, is 365 days, while at the upper end, Neptune takes a whopping 60,190 days, or about 165 Earth years, to complete a single revolution of our star.\n\nThe different speeds of the planets mean that, on occasion, several of them can be roughly lined up on the same side of the Sun. From Earth, if the orbits line up just right, we can see multiple planets in our night sky at the same time. In rare events, all the planets will line up such that they all appear in our night sky together along the ecliptic, the path traced by the Sun.\n\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are all bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, while Uranus and Neptune require binoculars or a telescope to spot.\n\nIn January and February, we can witness this event taking place. The planets are not exactly lined up, so they will appear in an arc across the sky due to their orbital plane in the Solar System. During clear nights in January and February, all of the planets except Mercury will be visible \u2013 an event sometimes called a planetary parade. On 28 February, though \u2013 weather permitting \u2013 all seven planets will be visible, a great spectacle for observers on the ground.\n\n\"There is something special about looking at the planets with your own eyes,\" says Jenifer Millard, a science communicator and astronomer at Fifth Star Labs in the UK. \"Yes, you can go on Google and get a more spectacular view of all these planets. But when you're looking at these objects, these are photons that have travelled millions or billions of miles through space to hit your retinas.\"\n\nGetty Images Stargazers will be able to enjoy the sight of the planets on a clear night through January and February, culminating with seven visible all at once (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nWhile fascinating to observe, do such alignments have any impact here on Earth? Or might they have a use for increasing our understanding of our Solar System and beyond?\n\nIn fact, says Millard, \"it's just happenstance that they happen to be in this position of their orbits\". And while there have been suggestions from some scientists that planetary alignments might cause impacts on Earth, the scientific basis for most of these claims is weak or non-existent.\n\nIn 2019, however, researchers suggested that planetary alignments could have an impact on solar activity. One of the main outstanding questions about the Sun is what drives its 11-year cycle between periods of peak activity, known as solar maximum (which we are currently in), and periods of weakest activity, solar minimum. Frank Stefani, a physicist at Helmholtz-Zentrum, research centre in Dresden-Rossendorf in Germany, suggested the combined tidal forces of Venus, Earth and Jupiter could be the answer.\n\nWhile the tidal pull of each planet on the Sun is extremely small, Stefani says that when two or more of the planets line up with the Sun \u2013 known as a syzygy \u2013 they might combine to cause small rotations inside the star, called Rossby waves, which can drive weather events.\n\n\"On Earth, Rossby waves cause cyclones and anticyclones,\" says Stefani. \"We have the same Rossby waves in the Sun.\" Stefani's calculations showed that the alignments of Venus, Earth and Jupiter would cause a periodicity to solar activity of 11.07 years, almost exactly matching the length of solar cycles that we see.\n\nNot everyone is so sure about the idea, with some noting that solar activity can already be explained by processes within the Sun alone. \"The observational evidence suggests that the planets directly causing the solar cycle just doesn't happen,\" says Robert Cameron, a solar scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System research in Germany, who published a paper on the subject in 2022. \"There's no evidence of any synchronisation.\"\n\nBut there are other, far less contentious, quirks of planetary alignments which certainly do have an impact on us: their usefulness for scientific observations, particularly in terms of exploring the Solar System.\n\nUsing the gravitational pull of a well-placed planet, such as Jupiter, to slingshot a spacecraft outwards can reduce the travel time dramatically\n\nReaching the outer planets with a spacecraft is difficult because these worlds are so far away, billions of miles, and would take decades to reach. However, using the gravitational pull of a well-placed planet, such as Jupiter, to slingshot a spacecraft outwards can reduce the travel time dramatically, something no spacecraft has done better than Nasa's Voyager vehicles.\n\nIn 1966, a Nasa scientist called Gary Flandro calculated that there would be an alignment of the four outermost planets \u2013 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune \u2013 in 1977 that would enable all four to be visited within a span of just 12 years, compared to 30 years if they were not aligned. This fortuitous alignment, which occurs only once every 175 years, led to Nasa launching the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft in 1977 on a \"Grand Tour\" of the outer Solar System.\n\nVoyager 1 flew past Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980, eschewing Uranus and Neptune because scientists wanted to fly past Titan, Saturn's fascinating moon, and could not do so without ruining the slingshot effect.\n\nBut Voyager 2 used the alignment to visit all four planets, becoming the only spacecraft in history to visit Uranus and Neptune, in 1986 and 1989 respectively.\n\n\"That worked out fantastic,\" says Fran Bagenal, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder in the US and a member of the Voyager science team. \"If Voyager 2 had left in 1980, it would have taken until 2010 to get to Neptune. I don't think it would have won support. Who's going to fund such a thing?\"\n\nGetty Images In 2024 it was possible to see Mars and Jupiter in conjunction with the naked eye but Venus, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune will also be visible in January 2025 (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIt is not just within our Solar System that planet alignments are useful. Astronomers use alignments to probe many different aspects of the Universe, and none more so than in the discovery and study of exoplanets, worlds that orbit stars other than the Sun.\n\nThe dominant way of finding such worlds is known as the transit method: when an exoplanet passes in front of a star from our point of view it dims the star's light, allowing its size and orbit to be discerned.\n\nThanks to this method, we have discovered many planets in orbit around certain stars. Trappist-1, a red dwarf star located 40 light-years from Earth, has seven Earth-sized planets that all transit the star from our point of view. The planets in that system are actually in resonance with each other \u2013 meaning the outermost planet completes two orbits for every three orbits of the next planet inwards, then four, six, and so on. This means there are periods where multiple planets in the system align in a straight line, something that doesn't happen in our Solar System.\n\nUsing transits, we can study the existence of atmospheres on planets like these. \"If a planet with an atmosphere goes in front of a star, that alignment means the starlight goes through the planet, and the molecules and atoms in the planet's atmosphere absorb light at certain wavelengths,\" says Jessie Christiansen, an astronomer at the Nasa Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nThis allows different gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen to be identified. \"The vast majority of our atmospheric composition analysis is due to alignments,\" she says.\n\nMuch grander alignments can let us probe the distant Universe, namely the alignments of galaxies. Observing galaxies in the very early universe is difficult because they are so faint and far away. However, if a large galaxy or cluster of galaxies passes between our line of sight with a much more distant early galaxy, its large gravitational pull can magnify the light of the more distant object, allowing us to observe and study it, a process called gravitational lensing.\n\n\"These are huge alignments across the scale of the universe,\" says Christiansen. They are used by telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope to observe remote stars and galaxies such as Earendel, the most distant known star from Earth. The light viewed by the telescope from the star came from the first billion years of the 13.7-billion-year-history of the Universe and was visible only because of gravitational lensing.\n\nGetty Images The different orbital speeds of the planets in our Solar System means several of them can occasionally line up in the same part of the sky at the same time (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nAnd then there are some more novel uses of alignments, such as probing the existence of extraterrestrial life, in solar systems where the exoplanets pass in front of each other from our point of view.\n\nIn 2024, graduate student Nick Tusay at Pennsylvania State University in the US used these alignments to look for any spillover communications being sent between worlds of the Trappist-1 system, such as how on Earth we send signals to planets like Mars in our solar system to talk to rovers and spacecraft. \"Any time that two planets are aligned might be interesting,\" says Tusay.\n\nOn this occasion the searches turned up short. But an alien civilisation looking towards our own Solar System might use similar alignments for the same purpose. While the planetary parade this month depends on your point of view \u2013 any two planets in our system can be aligned if you are positioned at the right angle \u2013 it's not impossible to imagine someone else on the other end, watching on.\n\n\"Perhaps another alien civilisation might see this as an opportunity to conduct their own investigations,\" says Tusay.\n\n--\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter \u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week."
