        "article_content": "It is the question we have all been waiting for... has an extraterrestrial being ever walked on Earth?\n\nIf one organization knows the answer to that it would be the US Government, and the verdict is finally in.\n\nOn Thursday (October 17), a press conference was held at the Pentagon and Major General Pat Ryder was on hand to answer questions about some tough topics.\n\nAdvert\n\nSome of these were the fact that North Korean soldiers are now fighting on behalf of Russia in Ukraine, Hamas' leader Yahya Sinwar died earlier this month and artillery strikes from the American stealth bomber B-2 on five military sites controlled by Houthi forces in Yemen.\n\nOf course, there were more subjects but they lead the daily news agenda.\n\nJournalist Jeff Schogol of Task & Purpose, a military news outlet, took a shot in the dark and decided quite sneakily that he would use this opportunity to ask in a roundabout way whether aliens had ever visited Earth.\n\nDefense Department Press Secretary Major General Pat Ryder gave a witty response to whether aliens had visited Earth (Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nAdvert\n\nHe said: \"Given the news cycle, you could announce anything about aliens or extraterrestrial life, and no one would care.\n\n\"So\u2026 I\u2019m just going to take the shot. What do you got on UFOs, aliens, etc.?\u201d\n\nHilariously, Ryder gave a nod to the epic sci-fi series The X-Files through its tagline 'the truth is out there', which opens every episode, before schooling Schogol.\n\nHe said: \"The truth is out there, Jeff, and the truth is, we have no evidence to indicate extraterrestrial life has visited the planet.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nSo the 'truth' is that the US Government, the authority behind the infamous Area 51 which is regularly rumored to know a great deal about the unidentified flying objects, has never encountered alien life on Earth.\n\nThe official name of Area 51 is in fact the Nevada Test and Training Range, and it is now used as a training range for the US Air Force.\n\nI digress.\n\nSo, what does Ryder mean when he explained that the truth is actually already out there?\n\nAdvert\n\nA popular conspiracy theory is that a flying saucer crash landed in New Mexico baxck in 1947 and its remains were taken to Area 51 so that officials could reverse engineer the spacecraft (Getty stock)\n\nIn 2022, the Department of Defense established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), created to look into the age-old question of whether aliens had visited Earth.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the investigation, a report read: \"The aggregate findings of all USG [US Government] investigations to date have not found even one case of UAP [unidentified anomalous phenomena aka UFO] representing off-world technology.\"\n\nIt added that 'authentic sensitive national security programs' were 'mistaken' for UFO programs.\n\nAdvert\n\nIt continued: \u201cAARO has no evidence for the USG reverse-engineering narrative provided by interviewees and has been able to disprove the majority of the interviewees\u2019 claims.\"\n\nSo there you have it, the answer is a firm no... for now."

Even though ChatGPT is the biggest platform in terms of revenue growth, it isn't the only one that is seeing incredible revenue growth. AppFigures\u2019 analysis highlights the impressive revenue growth of Claude, CoPilot, and Perplexity across the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. (Sorry Google lovers, Gemini wasn't included in the analysis).If we talk about Claude, CoPilot and Perplexity collectively, they have already gotten $13.3 million in revenue from January 2024 to September 2024. An important thing to note is that CoPilot didn't start earning until May 2024 and Claude was launched in May 2024. The consumers spent a total of $2.8 million on this trio in September 2024.CoPilot is catching up on its revenue and is not far behind Perplexity. This year, all three AI models have started getting double digit revenue every month. According to the estimates by AppFigures , the total revenue of Claude, CoPilot and Perplexity chatbots was increased 11% in September 2024. Even though the growth of this trio is incredible, Claude is still seeing the highest revenue growth. It gained 22% month over month revenue in September 2024, while Perplexity got 10% and CoPilot got 1% month over month revenue.In terms of total spend, Claude comes last at $2.4 million. Perplexity got $3.7 million and CoPilot got $3.6 million. As compared to these three, ChatGPT\u2019s spend is 15 times more every month. But as the trends are changing, the future of search is also going to change. Perplexity is catching up fast so we have to see which AI model will become Google of this era.Read next: Is Google Giving YouTube Unfair Advantage? AI Overviews See Huge Spike in Citations"

WhatsApp is no exception, with the app gaining the services of the Meta AI chatbot not too long ago. We've seen WhatsApp make multiple changes to its Meta AI implementation over the past few updates, with the app recently adding granular editing controls for AI-generated images. WhatsApp is now working on another update for its AI chatbot, one that could make it easier to manage what it remembers about your chats.\n\nThe WhatsApp sleuths over at WABetaInfo dug into version 2.24.22.9 of WhatsApp beta for Android to find a new Memory section within the app. More specifically, this Memory option has sprung up within the Chat info page, accessed by tapping the top of a chat.\n\nOn older betas of WhatsApp for Android, the Chat info page contains minimal options, including buttons for Message, Share, and Search, followed by a brief disclaimer about how AI can get things wrong at times.\n\nThere are also options for managing notifications and deciding whether media generated by Meta AI is saved to the device's gallery. But with v2.24.22.9 of WhatsApp beta for Android, a brand-new Memory option appears right below Media visibility, along with the description \"What Meta AI remembers about you.\"\n\nA much-needed privacy addition\n\nWhatsApp Meta AI Memory Tab\n\nThe text inside the Memory page mentions that \"Meta AI automatically remembers certain parts of your chat to give you more relevant responses.\" Users can ensure the chatbot remembers something by asking it to \"remember this\" after a prompt. Having Meta AI remember specific parts of your conversation should help generate better-quality responses over a period of time, especially if it's a subject you bring up frequently with the chatbot.\n\nWhile it's unclear what this Memory page will look like when populated, we suspect there will be an easy option to remove any memory the chatbot has stored. WABetaInfo says this feature is still in development, which explains why I couldn't get it to appear despite sideloading the APK from APKMirror. Nevertheless, given how important a feature like this is, particularly from a privacy perspective, we expect it to eventually make it to the stable version of the chat app.\n\nWhatsApp Messenger\n\nWhatsApp LLC\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nPrice: Free\n\n4.3\n\nDownload"

Now the horror movie studio behind the likes of Paranormal Activity, Five Nights at Freddy's and BlacKkKlansman is working with Meta to test Meta Movie Gen, the AI video generator that the owner of Facebook and Instagram revealed earlier this month. And that could be a scary combination.\n\nSelect creatives are taking part in the pilot, including Casey Affleck from I\u2019m Still Here and Light of My Life, Aneesh Chaganty, and the Spurlock Sisters, who are part of Blumhouse\u2019s first annual Screamwriting Fellowship. Aneesh has already produced a video using Meta's AI tool in which he says he was all against AI until he realised that his ten-year-old self would have loved it for his homemade movies.\n\nFor the video above, Aneesh used Meta Movie Gen to change the backdrops or add special effects to short movies he made as a kid \u201cI hate AI. But with a tool like this? I dunno\u2026 maybe I\u2019d have just dreamed a little bigger,\" he says, noting that what he likes about the tool is that \"little Aneesh would still have had to make the movie.\"\n\nIt's an emotive and clever plug for the tech that highlights its potential for human-led storytelling while also excusing the current limited quality of the AI output. I mean, sure, it is good enough for a kid's home movie. I would have been thrilled to have had access to this tech when I was a kid trying to produce Doctor Who episodes in the lunch break at primary school.\n\nBlumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum continues the tone in his statement in Meta's announcement. \u201cArtists are, and forever will be, the lifeblood of our industry,\u201d he says. \"Innovation and tools that can help those artists better tell their stories is something we are always keen to explore, and we welcomed the chance for some of them to test this cutting-edge technology and give their notes on its pros and cons while it\u2019s still in development.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThese are going to be powerful tools for directors, and it\u2019s important to engage the creative industry in their development to make sure they\u2019re best suited for the job.\u201d\n\nAs for Meta, it says Movie Gen will allow creatives to more quickly express ideas and \"explore visual direction, tone and mood.\u201d \u201cWe heard that filmmakers see potential for Movie Gen as a collaborator and thought partner, with its unexpected response to text prompts inspiring new ideas,\u201d it said.\n\nIt also seems that public access to Movie Gen might arrive sooner than we thought. Meta initially said it had no plans to open access \"anytime soon\". But CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted on Instagram to say Movie Gen would be coming to the platform next year (he made the announcement via a video of himself doing leg presses in different historical eras \u2013 you can see that gem below).\n\nA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) A photo posted by on\n\nConnor Hayes, VP of gen AI, has confirmed that timeframe. \u201cWhile we\u2019re not planning to incorporate Movie Gen models into any public products until next year, Meta feels it\u2019s important to have an open and early dialogue with the creative community about how it can be the most useful tool for creativity and ensure its responsible use,\u201d he said.\n\nMeta's collaboration with Blumhouse is another example of how studios are starting to take AI video generation seriously. It comes shortly after Runway entered into a deal to create a bespoke AI model for the film and TV producer Lionsgate.\n\nMeta says Movie Gen can currently create videos of up to 16 seconds in different aspect ratios and audio of up to 45 seconds and that it compares well against Runway, OpenAI's Sora and Kling. If it gets a release, Meta's AI video generator is also likely to compete against Adobe Firefly Video, which is already powering the new Generative Extend in Premiere Pro.\n\nIt's not clear how the model was trained, however. Meta has said that Movie Gen was trained on a \u201ca combination of licensed and publicly available datasets\u201d but hasn't specified which. Meta has access to vast amounts of video data through its products like Instagram and Facebook."

With age, he developed lifestyle diseases and decided to reverse them by changing diet and lifestyle. This led him to study and research in the field of nutrition and plant-based whole food field. Eventually, he successfully got rid of all his chronic diseases and reinvented himself. Lalit became an inspiration for his IIT-K batch mates and started to guide them with his learnings. Many of them benefitted and successfully reversed their chronic diseases. He further incorporated the Nobel prize winning work by Nobel laureates Dr Yoshinori Ohsumi (2016) on autophagy, Dr Jeffery Hall (2017) on circadian rhythm and Dr Tasuko Honzo (2018) on immunotherapy into his recommendations. He has conducted over 450 course sessions which have been attended by over 150,000 people in over 50 countries with thousands of success stories. He runs over 100 active social groups and his NGO \u201cPlant Based Wellness Foundation\u201d has over 40 centers worldwide. Lalit has also taught a course as a visiting faculty on Nutrition & Health at IIT Kanpur for one semester. LESS ... MORE\n\nDuring the early 20th century, several significant developments led to the emergence of what we now call modern medicine:\n\n1. The overhaul of medical education, initiated by the Flexner Report in 1910, commissioned at the request of John Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, the two richest men in the world.\n\n2. The discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, a bacteriologist at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in London.\n\n3. The discovery of vitamin C by Hungarian biochemist Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi in 1928, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1937.\n\nIt had long been known that sailors on extendegd voyages suffered from a disease called scurvy. The French and British navies had established recommendations for sailors to consume citrus fruits daily. However, after the discovery of vitamin C, it was believed that the ill health of sailors was due to a deficiency in vitamin C. This understanding contributed to the evolution of the science of nutrition as we know it today. Modern nutrition is largely reductionist, focusing on breaking down food into its nutrient components. Patients are diagnosed based on the composition of nutrients in their blood, with deficiencies supplemented and surpluses managed through dietary restrictions.\n\nHad early observers of scurvy in sailors concluded that the problem was due to a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables, rather than solely a vitamin C deficiency\u2014which we now know to be a more accurate understanding\u2014the trajectory of nutrition science might have been different. However, this approach would have posed a challenge: it wouldn\u2019t have generated profit. Neither doctors, supplement manufacturers, nor pharmaceutical companies would have benefited. Dr. Colin Campbell, regarded as one of the foremost nutritionists today, has consistently emphasized the need to rewrite nutrition science and unlearn much of what has been taught over the past century.\n\nThe discovery of epigenetics in recent decades has shown us that it is not just the individual components of nutrition that matter, but the whole food, along with its inherent bacteria. As Dr. Campbell puts it, rather than focusing on individual instruments, we should focus on the symphony.\n\nNutrition science has unfortunately centered around creating a \u201cnormal\u201d range for various nutrients, against which any sample is analyzed. Let\u2019s explore how these so called normal ranges are derived.\n\nWhat is normal?\n\nWhen you get lab tests done\u2014whether blood, urine, or stool\u2014the report compares your results to a range called \u201cnormal.\u201d But have you ever wondered who decided what \u201cnormal\u201d is?\n\nThis range is derived from a large sample of the population. For any test, readings vary from person to person, forming a bell curve. The area under two standard deviations (2\u03c3) covers about 95% of the total sample. This is what \u201cnormal\u201d means. For example, if your hemoglobin is between 14-17 g/dL, you fall within the 95% of the population. If your reading is above 17 or below 14, it simply means you\u2019re in the top or bottom 2.5%. This is often misunderstood as a sign of a problem, which may or may not be the case.\n\nIt\u2019s essential for both you and your doctor to understand why your reading is outside the \u201cnormal\u201d range. For some blood chemistry markers, the cutoff is determined by committees made up of healthcare providers, pharmaceutical industry representatives, and government agencies like the FDA. For example, the criteria for total cholesterol, vitamin D, fasting glucose, and blood pressure are established by different bodies.\n\nThere are various vested interests in keeping these cutoff points low (or high), as it can increase the number of patients, benefiting doctors and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nSince modern medicine has largely developed in Western countries like England and America, large samples were taken from their local populations to establish these \u201cnormal\u201d criteria. These reflect the diet, lifestyle, and health of those populations. However, in countries like India, medical guidelines are often adopted from the West without considering genetic differences and dietary habits.\n\nFor example, Americans predominantly consume meat, while many Indians are vegetarians, leading to discrepancies. Hemoglobin is one area where Indian people often fall short of the established \u201cnormal\u201d range. But this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are unhealthy or in need of medication or supplements.\n\nAnother example is potassium. The normal range is 3.6 to 5.2mmol/L. Americans typically don\u2019t consume much green leafy vegetables, which are rich in potassium. Once you start a diet rich in plant-based whole foods, intermittent fasting, or similar health-conscious programs, your potassium intake rises, and blood tests may show levels above the upper range. This doesn\u2019t mean you have a health problem\u2014it means you\u2019re healthier than 95% of Americans!\n\nVicious cycle of overdiagnosis\n\nWhat increasingly happens is that a seemingly healthy person with poor eating habits undergoes a checkup at age 45 or 50. The doctor orders various tests, points out discrepancies, and prescribes medication or supplements. You take the medication, start to worry, and a \u201cnocebo effect\u201d takes hold\u2014you imagine symptoms. Medication also comes with side effects or adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Within six months, you feel unwell and visit the doctor again, who prescribes more medication. This vicious cycle continues, and before long, you\u2019re 60 years old and taking five medications. This is what happened to me.\n\nDoctors today are not trained in nutrition, so they don\u2019t provide dietary guidance. If pressed by patients, they share whatever they\u2019ve gleaned from mass media, which is heavily influenced by the food and drug industry.\n\nDon\u2019t kill the messenger\n\nLifestyle diseases exist on a continuum. They start as soon as a child is weaned off breast milk and begins eating whatever their parents feed him. If the diet is unhealthy, the body compensates by increasing blood pressure, insulin secretion, or other mechanisms. These compensatory systems keep major markers like blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol in check. However, once the body can no longer compensate, these markers slowly rise. When they reach a certain point, as determined by governing bodies like the ADA, AHA, or ACP, the person is labeled as having a chronic disease.\n\nThe right approach would be to correct the diet and lifestyle that led to the rise in markers. However, in practice, doctors focus on lowering the markers through medication. When the markers return to the \u201cnormal\u201d range, the person feels \u201chealed,\u201d but no attention is paid to the underlying cause. Over time, the markers rise again, and the doctor either increases the medication dose or adds a new drug. The side effects of these medications often lead to other health issues.\n\nI call this the suppression of symptoms, akin to killing the messenger. Rather than addressing the root cause\u2014an unhealthy diet and lifestyle\u2014we attack the symptoms. Most medications for lifestyle diseases work this way: they don\u2019t address the disease\u2019s cause, just the symptoms. Unfortunately, nutrition science is not part of medical school curricula, and doctors are trained to focus on managing symptoms and bring them in normal range rather than understanding the bigger picture of health.\n\nPlease listen to Padma Vibhushan Dr. B.M.Hegde and Dr. Colin Campbell speak on the subject.\n\nWhat is Normal BP\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NQoD-LiwSFw? si=swZtRjvq4LIgzI1V\n\nT.

        "article_content": "Summarize Simplifying... In short A recent study has discovered that the liver's bile production, which helps flush out cholesterol, is influenced by the rate of blood flow from the intestine.\n\nThis blood flow, which varies throughout the day due to activities like exercise and eating, triggers a protein that converts cholesterol into bile acids.\n\nHowever, low bile production can lead to high cholesterol levels, potentially causing liver diseases.\n\nThis groundbreaking research could aid in treating liver and digestive system diseases. Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nThe discovery could help in treating cardiovascular diseases\n\nNew study reveals how liver flushes out cholesterol\n\nBy Akash Pandey 01:21 pm Oct 20, 202401:21 pm\n\nWhat's the story In a groundbreaking study, researchers at the University of Leeds have revealed a new way in which the liver rids the body of cholesterol. The discovery could pave the way for more effective treatments for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide. The study looked at bile production, an essential process for removing excess cholesterol from the body, and its link with blood flow into the liver.\n\nKey findings\n\nBile production and blood flow: A crucial connection\n\nThe study found bile production is affected by how quickly blood enters the liver via the \"portal\" vein from the intestine. It was found that this blood flow varies throughout the day as a result of movement, rest, and eating. The researchers found an inverse relationship between bile production and portal vein blood flow, with bile production increasing during periods of decreased blood flow due to exercise or fasting.\n\nHealth risks\n\nImplications of low bile production on health\n\nThe research also emphasized that low bile production can result in high cholesterol levels in the blood, which may contribute to fatty liver disease. If untreated, this can progress into liver inflammation and fibrosis. Dr. Laeticia Lichtenstein, the lead researcher of the study, stressed the importance of their findings saying, \"This discovery...is incredible.\" She added that these findings could help doctors treating liver and digestive system diseases.\n\nNovel discovery\n\nLink between portal vein blood flow and cholesterol\n\nPublished in Science Advances, the study is the first to link portal vein blood flow to blood cholesterol levels. It found that a pressure-sensing protein called PIEZO1 senses the change in blood flow rate through the vein. This initiates a chemical reaction that converts cholesterol into bile acids for removal from the body. The study highlights the liver's importance in controlling fat levels in blood and avoiding fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, liver failure, and cancer.\n\nCholesterol types\n\nCholesterol: A double-edged sword\n\nCholesterol, a fat necessary for normal body functioning, can be both good and bad. There are two types of cholesterol - \"good\" cholesterol that helps body functions and \"bad\" cholesterol that can build up in arteries, increasing heart disease and stroke risks. High cholesterol levels may be due to genetics, certain medications or health conditions but are also associated with lifestyle factors like unhealthy diets, lack of physical activity, obesity, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption."

The changes happening locally and globally in computing have created an incredible, once-in-a-generation opportunity that DPI is well-situated to harness for our state.\"\n\nDPI South will be a \"quantum-focused facility\" established in partnership with globally recognized companies, officials said.\n\nThe plan also includes maintaining downtown headquarters as \"DPI North.\" The institute will continue to operate from 200 S. Wacker Drive while also looking at options for locating the new DPI North.\n\nKilleen said the institute is committed to maintaining its headquarters in downtown Chicago.\n\n\"As a public university system, we must ensure that we maximize the benefits of DPI's headquarters for us, the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois as this vital work continues,\" Killeen said.\n\nIn discussing these plans, UI officials said that the changes would allow the institute to \"optimize\" the impact of state funding and capitalize on opportunities presented by \"major shifts in technology\" as well as the federal CHIPS and Science Act.\n\nOver the seven years since DPI was announced, the potential of quantum computing to help solve challenges in a variety of areas \u2014 health care, food production, manufacturing and climate science, to name a few \u2014 has only become more evident, officials said.\n\nKilleen said the UI System has shared its new vision for DPI with Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who appreciated the magnitude of the opportunity and supports the expansion of its focus.\n\nThe state has provided $500 million for the institute and the Illinois Innovation Network, a network of research and innovation hubs throughout Illinois, under Pritzker's administration.\n\nThe state has also invested $500 million in developing the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park. Pritzker announced in July that the campus would be located at USX on the South Side of Chicago. It will be managed by a UI-led organization on behalf of the state and Pritzker."

Despite the recent lack of form, Alabama is favored by 3 points over Tennessee for Saturday\u2019s game at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville.\n\nTennessee began the season hot but came back to Earth with a road loss to Arkansas. The Vols needed overtime to beat Florida at home last week. The last time Tennessee met Alabama in Knoxville, Tennessee won an all-time thriller on a last-second field goal.\n\nWith Alabama struggling on defense and Tennessee boasting an offensive with high-scoring potential, Saturday\u2019s game has a lofty over/under of 56.5 points."
