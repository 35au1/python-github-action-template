        "article_content": "An Air Force base in Indiana has become the latest hotspot for mysterious UFOs after residents spotted swarms of fast-moving, glowing orbs in the skies.\n\nDozens of people in Kokomo, which sits just 13 miles south of Grissom Joint Air Reserve Base, reported seeing hovering flickering lights that vanished into thin air.\n\n'What is that,' shouted one local who filmed the lights. 'I think those are UFOs and I really don't feel comfortable going to sleep tonight.'\n\nThe uncanny sightings, most reported on October 7, echo recent UFO waves near military sites, including Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia where officials reported seeing 'flashing red, green, and white lights' that were 'moving at rapid speeds.'\n\nThe mysterious objects in Indiana, however, were shared by civilians online, where experts have weighed in to determine the source.\n\nSome suggested the lights were flares dropped from planes, possibly military craft \u2014 but one witness shared doppler weather radar evidence of a 'huge rectangle' UFO with a 'clearly defined vapor shock wave' seen the morning after, October 8.\n\nRed 'walking' swarms of UFOs - along with one fast, zig-zagging, gleaming white UFO - have terrified and confused residents of Kokomo, Indiana this October\n\nNo explanation has been publicly provided by US Air Force personnel for the UFOs, which appeared as both reddish-orange orbs that hovered in the sky as well as one white orb that zig-zagged in a fast maneuver.\n\n'I don't understand what those are,' Christina Sharp said in a TikTok as young children nearby were heard marveling at the glowing reddish-orange lights.\n\nOne anonymous local submitted a report to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) on October 8 of what may have been a related event.\n\nThe person stated that a brief incursion on doppler weather radar showed what looked like a large rectangle UFO speeding nearby, estimated to be about half as big as Disney World.\n\n'I've seen many easily explained radar anomalies over the years,' the witness said, 'but never a huge rectangle with a clearly defined vapor shock wave and trail.'\n\n'Judging by the image size, rectangle would be approximately 20 miles in length,' the witness added.\n\n'Compressed vapor trail appears to be in excess of 150-miles long.'\n\nWhile it's unclear if this bizarre radar return relates to the previous night's wave of strange lights in the sky, several seasoned analysts of UFO videos told DailyMail.com that Kokomo's citizens most likely saw military flares.\n\nOne anonymous witness who submitted a report to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) witnessed a baffling and potentially related event: a brief incursion on doppler weather radar (above) of what looked like a large rectangle UFO speeding nearby, estimated to be about half as big as Disney World (20 miles long). The radar UFO was seen the morning after\n\n'These look very clearly to be military flares,' said Alejandro Rojas, an advisor to tech start-up Enigma Labs, where he helps investigate witness submissions to the group's growing database of UFO sightings.\n\n'The tell-tale signs,' Rojas explained, 'are the lights being in a row and lighting up and disappearing in succession.'\n\nIn addition to the Grissom base to the north, Rojas noted several other USAF bases surrounding Kokomo that may have been responsible for the late night lightshow.\n\n'Kokomo is around 50 miles away from Camp Fort Wayne [Fort Wayne Air National Guard Base],' he added.\n\n'Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton is also about 150 miles away. These could be from either location.'\n\nRojas, who served for many years as the official spokesperson for the citizen-led Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), said that he has personally witnessed and videotaped just how eerie military flares can look under the cover of darkness.\n\nWhile it's unclear if the bizarre radar return relates to the previous night's wave of strange lights in the sky, one seasoned analyst of UFO videos told DailyMail.com that Kokomo's citizens most likely saw military flares: Alejandro Rojas, an advisor to tech start-up Enigma Labs\n\n'I live in the Phoenix, Arizona area and they often drop these flares while doing exercises at the Barry Goldwater Range,' he said. 'Sure enough they are also often mistaken for UFOs and sometimes the media will call me for a comment.'\n\nRojas, who has co-founded a new nonprofit to look into 'unidentified aerial phenomena,' UAP Discovery, said the night sky can obscure more obvious signs of flares, like smoke or the aircraft that dropped the flares in the first place.\n\n'Witnesses have argued that smoke can be seen from flares, but that is typically not the case,' he told DailyMail.com.\n\n'I made this video to show that smoke often can not be seen,' he said. 'My video is similar to most of the ones being alleged to be UFOs. I was about 150 miles from the flares when I took this video.'\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to the public affairs specialist at the Grissom base and also to the relevant staff with Indiana's Air National Guard. This article will be updated with any new information that they provide.\n\nFor now, a public affairs representative for the Grissom base has told DailyMail.com, 'Grissom has KC-135 Stratotankers [a large, Boeing-made, aerial refueling tanker aircraft], and they don't have flares.'\n\nThe strange cases in Indiana come just weeks after new government records surfaced about other UFO waves near military sites, including 17 nights in December 2023 when swarms of UFOs were tracked over Joint Base Langley-Eustis.\n\nThese brazen penetrations over Langley \u2014 home to at least half the Air Force's F-22 Raptor stealth fighters \u2014 led to two weeks of emergency White House meetings.\n\nTo date, Langley's mystery UFOs have eluded identification by the Pentagon, police and even NASA's high-altitude research plane, the WB-57F, called in to investigate.\n\nGeneral Glen VanHerck, the commander with North American Aerospace Defense (NORAD), who led the mission to takedown the infamous Chinese spy balloon back in February 2023, described that Langley wave as unlike any other known case.\n\n'If there are unknown objects within North America,' General VanHerck told the Wall Street Journal, 'go out and identify them.'\n\nSenior ex- Pentagon security official Chris Mellon told DailyMail.com last week that the UFOs were 'swarms of smaller craft' released by 'motherships.'\n\nHe explained that the episode last December was 'part of a much larger pattern affecting numerous national security installations.'\n\n'Two of the notable aspects,' he said, 'are the fact our drone signal-jamming devices have proven ineffective and these craft are making no effort to remain concealed.'\n\n'In fact, in some instances,' as Mellon took pains to emphasize, 'it is clear they want to be seen as though taunting us.'"

        "source": "AppleInsider",
        "article_content": "Apple Intelligence is the product of more than a year's worth of tireless testing. Here's what Apple engineers used to ensure the quality of their AI software.\n\nFor Apple, 2024 was undoubtedly the year of artificial intelligence. The company has long been working on machine learning features, with its most recent operating systems ushering in an entirely new set of AI-powered enhancements. They are known collectively under the moniker of Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhile the generative AI tools themselves were announced in June, at WWDC 2024, only a handful of them made their public debut with the first developer betas of iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1. Since then, Apple has rolled out more and more of the AI-powered enhancements with subsequent beta releases.\n\nAt the time of writing, the iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1 updates are nearing the end of beta testing, while the first developer beta of iOS 18.2 has only just arrived. Months after the big announcement, some Apple Intelligence features are still only available on beta versions of Apple's operating systems.\n\nAccording to people who spoke with AppleInsider and accurately revealed many Apple Intelligence features months ahead of launch, the company spent a year working on its in-house generative AI tools before they were finally released to the general public.\n\nDuring development, Apple tried to keep the full scale of its AI endeavors a secret. Individual AI projects received their own codenames, as was the case with the email categorization feature, known as Project BlackPearl.\n\nApple Intelligence as a whole, however, was known by the codename Greymatter \u2014 an unmistakable reference to a type of tissue found in the human brain. Some of Apple's internal test applications also had names that concealed their overall purpose.\n\nDuring the development of Apple Intelligence, Apple used at least two dedicated test applications and environments to test its AI software.\n\nApple used multiple test applications during the development of iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\n\nThe two apps in question are known as 1UP, a reference to the ever-popular Super Mario series by Nintendo, and Smart Replies Tester. The name of the latter is self-explanatory, given that AI-powered Smart Replies have since made their way into release versions of Apple's operating systems, in the Mail and Messages applications.\n\nWe were told that internal distributions of iOS 18.0 and macOS 15.0 Sequoia featured many of the underlying Apple Intelligence frameworks used in the publicly available betas of iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1.\n\nThe frameworks were necessary for testing and were included alongside the standard development and configuration utilities found in Apple's internal-use operating systems.\n\nDifferent AI-related features could be toggled through feature flags, with the use of the Livability application. 1UP and Smart Replies Tester, the two known AI applications, were used by Apple's engineers to test the different aspects and use cases of Apple Intelligence.\n\n1UP \u2014 Text-generation testing with AI models\n\nFound even in the earliest internal-use builds of iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, the 1UP application was used for testing text-related generative AI features. The application itself featured a variety of different test options and parameters, which could be adjusted as needed.\n\nThe 1UP app featured tests related to text-generation, and references to the Ajax large language model.\n\nPeople familiar with the application have told AppleInsider that it contains direct references to Apple's long-rumored in-house LLM or large language model, known as Ajax, which can function on-device.\n\nThe 1UP app features multiple test options, organized into different sections. One of the tests involves text generation. This part of the app was used to test \"autoregressive text generation from a prompt,\" people familiar with the app told us.\n\nIt allowed its users to choose between different AI models, including the aforementioned on-device Ajax LLM. The application also featured a setting to adjust the maximum number of generated tokens, which could be set anywhere from 30 to 100, the default being 48.\n\n1UP \u2014 Document analysis, topic analysis, and text understanding\n\nBased on what we were told, it's apparent that Apple placed significant focus on AI's document and file understanding. Some tests found within the 1UP app were focused on document and text analysis. Whether the user input consisted of raw text, a PDF, or a Word document, Apple's software was supposed to identify key information within the text, such as phone numbers, addresses, languages, and text author, if applicable.\n\nA mockup of the 1UP user interface, based on the information provided to us by people familiar with the app.\n\nWeb history from Safari and conversations from Messages could also be analyzed for keywords, or \"topics,\" as they were known within the app. This could include words that repeat often or those that appear to be the focal point of a text. Apple-specific terms are also recognized, and key sentences are isolated.\n\nThe app was also capable of cross-referencing the information found in a text or document with the user's information. For instance, whether or not a phone number was saved in the user's Contacts, or if an event was found in the Calendar.\n\nThe significance of the 1UP tests, and the clues about Apple Intelligence\n\nThe 1UP tests offered hints as to what would eventually become Apple Intelligence features, such as the upgraded Siri with personal context, and Writing Tools. With Apple Intelligence, it's possible to edit texts and generate text-based summaries of the user's conversations, where key details such as names, dates, and locations are highlighted.\n\nApple's own AI prompts also revealed that the company explored multiple levels of summarization, including summaries consisting of only 10 or 20 words. AppleInsider paraphrased many of these prompts before they were ever made public.\n\nThe tests within the 1UP are indicative of what Apple wanted to do with Safari as well, which was to have its AI use the information from web pages the user visits. This idea eventually led to the Intelligent Search feature, now known as Highlights.\n\nText generation and document analysis are now handled by ChatGPT rather than Apple's AI\n\nWith the first developer beta of iOS 18.2, Apple notably improved Siri through integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Requests and queries that Siri is unable to process are handed over to ChatGPT, albeit only with direct user approval.\n\nTests in the 1UP app seem to mirror the functionality made possible by ChatGPT integration in iOS 18.2.\n\niOS 18.2 also introduces a new splash screen outlining some of the key features made possible via ChatGPT integration, such as text generation in Writing Tools and document analysis.\n\nThe 1UP app features tests for virtually the same things, indicating that Apple had perhaps wanted to accomplish ChatGPT-like features independently, through its own AI models.\n\nAlong with the 1UP app, Apple used another internal application known as Smart Replies Tester.\n\nSmart Replies Tester \u2014 evaluating AI-generated responses\n\nWith iOS 18.1, Apple introduced AI-assisted Smart Replies, which are available in Mail and Messages. This feature makes it significantly easier to draft a response to an email or message within Apple's built-in apps.\n\nInternally, Apple used a dedicated app to test Smart Replies. It instantly generated multiple replies based on the input text.\n\nOn an iPhone, Smart Replies appear as response suggestions above the keyboard in Mail. Apple Intelligence can generate responses to direct questions the user may be replying to, but it is often less useful in other situations.\n\nSmart Replies Tester was seemingly built to test just that, how well Apple's AI can generate a response, and how quickly. The app measured the response generation time in milliseconds.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the internal application consists of multiple test menus where users can input text, and instantly receive several AI-generated Smart Replies. This occurs entirely on-device, and the responses change as soon as the input text is altered in any way.\n\nSmart Replies can be found in the Mail app on iOS 18.2.\n\nThe app also can be used with an image captioning model, which is downloaded separately. Mass image captioning was possible as well. As for similar features in the iOS 18.1 beta, the Photos application now contains a greatly improved search functionality, which lets people locate images containing specific objects or locations with relative ease.\n\nWhile Smart Replies Tester is distinctly AI-related, other internal applications also offer insight into Apple's approach and way of thinking in regard to artificial intelligence.\n\nMegadome \u2014 Your personal context, all in one app\n\nAnother of Apple's internal apps, Megadome serves as the perfect visual aid for Siri's upcoming personal context feature, powered by Apple Intelligence.\n\nThe Megadome app aggregates user data and organizes it into different categories.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the Megadome application can gather relevant user information, sort it into categories, and present it in the form of neatly organized cards.\n\nThe app can display the most important details about its user, including their full name, significant locations, relationships, groups, contact information, organizations, installed software, and much more. Megadome seemingly gathers this information from system applications the user has interacted with.\n\nThis information can also be viewed in the form of a so-called \"Reality Graph,\" which visualizes the relationship between entities and locations in the form of a diagram.\n\nWhy Apple made Megadome, and the features it mirrors\n\nWhile the idea of an app that knows everything about you might seem nightmarish at first glance, the app is merely an internal-use tool, not something made for the general public. Its existence ultimately makes sense when things are taken into context.\n\nApple's Megadome app offers some insights about the company's thought process.\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, Siri will gain the ability to process natural language. The virtual assistant will also have a firm grasp of the user's so-called personal context, as a result of the AI upgrade.\n\nThis means that Siri will be able to understand facts about the user's life \u2014 the different people and places important to them. In many ways, the Megadome app is an embodiment of this idea. Apple wanted to build a tool that could understand the important aspects of someone's life, and use these details to help the user.\n\nWhat does this mean for the future of Apple Intelligence?\n\nApple's internal applications often serve as an accurate indicator of things to come in the near future. Although they may feature various puns, memes, and obscure inside jokes, the company's test apps reveal quite a lot about in-development features.\n\nApple's test applications often contain tidbits about upcoming features, such as the ones powered by Apple Intelligence.\n\nWhile names such as 1UP, GreyParrot, and Megadome don't mean anything to the average user, almost everyone has used the Calculator or tested Apple Intelligence in one form or another.\n\nThis phenomenon is hardly anything new. Even back in 2020, the internal-use app known as Gobi painted a pretty good picture of what would eventually become App Clips. Should any information about future test apps come to light, we will most likely be able to infer something about an upcoming feature."

Her other app compiles data from multiple sources and issues daily reports.\n\n\u201cWhat I see with a lot of smaller business owners is they may never, you know, check their sales or their advertising on a daily basis, and they might just be losing out on money or on customers because they\u2019re not staying ahead of this and being able to deliver them,\u201d said Lacy.\n\nLacy says AI can help businesses make more informed decisions, but she\u2019s also focused on the ethical use of AI and double-checking what it spits out.\n\n\u201cEven though it is, you know, machine-controlled machine outputs, these outputs were created by humans,\u201d said Lacy. \u201cSo of course there\u2019s always biases that are baked into these models that can disadvantage people.\u201d\n\nAs a Forbes 30 under 30 honoree, she hopes her influence can break some barriers in the field of AI.\n\n\u201cYou look at some of the biggest AI companies right now, they\u2019re all run by men,\u201d said Lacy. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s a really great time to have more women in the field really thinking and just providing more diverse perspectives.\u201d\n\nLacy created the apps to serve as a lifeline for small businesses that can\u2019t afford social media management tools that cost hundreds of dollars. Her Social Chime and Insight Analytics apps start at $33 a month.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW"

        "article_content": "Ryan Haines / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR HONOR has announced its Magic OS 9.0 Android skin in China.\n\nThe new software brings an AI agent that can execute over 900 tasks using a simple command.\n\nPhones in China will get Magic OS 9.0 from next month.\n\nHONOR\u2019s Magic OS software isn\u2019t exactly our top Android skin, but it still offers plenty of features. Now, the Chinese manufacturer has launched the Android 15-based Magic OS 9.0 skin in its home market, and it brings a ton of AI features.\n\nHONOR says this latest software introduces the MagicLM family of AI models, which supports text, speech, audio, visuals, and more. The company specifically singled out a three-billion-parameter on-device AI model as part of the MagicLM suite, saying it will support mid-range and premium phones. Otherwise, HONOR says its cloud-based AI models will run across the \u201cfull range\u201d of its portfolio. It\u2019s unclear which features are on-device and which features require the cloud, though.\n\nAn AI agent for HONOR phones\n\nHONOR teased an AI agent at the Snapdragon 8 Elite launch earlier this week, and it\u2019s now fully revealed this upgraded experience. The company said it\u2019s turned its existing YoYo smart assistant into an AI agent, supporting natural language understanding, computer vision, user habit learning and \u201cscenario perception,\u201d intention recognition and decision-making smarts, and \u201cin-app and cross-app\u201d operation. What does that mean in practice, though?\n\nThe smartphone maker says the upgraded YoYo tool can understand user needs and independently operate to accomplish the user\u2019s goals. HONOR gave the example of ordering a latte with a simple command. YoYo is able to open the user\u2019s favorite food delivery app, figure out their preferred coffee shop, automatically place the order, and then verify the payment with the user.\n\nHONOR says its AI agent can automatically execute 900 tasks with a command, such as the aforementioned coffee delivery, managing subscription auto-renewal, tasks related to permissions and notifications, converting documents, and filling out forms. We\u2019ve asked HONOR whether this AI agent will be available in global markets and will update the article accordingly.\n\nMagic Portal and Magic Capsule improvements The new Android software also delivers upgrades to the firm\u2019s Magic Portal and Magic Capsule capabilities. The former currently allows users to seamlessly share text and images between apps by dragging and dropping, but it now better understands semantic context.\n\nMagic Portal also offers Circle to Search-style functionality. This lets you use your knuckle to circle content, with Magic Portal then recommending suitable apps for said content (e.g. offering a calendar app if you circle text containing an event name, date, and time). It\u2019s worth noting, though, that Circle to Search is already available on global HONOR handsets.\n\nMeanwhile, Magic Capsule is HONOR\u2019s Dynamic Island clone, and it now supports more scenarios. This includes flights, cab services, takeaways, movie playback, train service, and more.\n\nAI for photos and productivity We\u2019ve seen loads of AI-related features for photos in the last couple of years, and HONOR is hopping on this bandwagon too. The company\u2019s gallery app now supports object erasing, \u201cface restoration,\u201d and AI image expansion functionality.\n\nThe company is also joining rivals in offering a smattering of productivity-focused AI tools. This includes an AI Meetings feature (transcribe meetings, identify speakers, and provide meeting summaries), AI Docs functionality for writing assistance, and AI Translate for real-time translation.\n\nHONOR Magic OS 9.0 roadmap\n\nWeibo/HONOR Mobile\n\nHONOR\u2019s new software also brings previously showcased deepfake detection technology, upgraded MagicRing cross-device capabilities, and a Magic Personalization suite of system customization tools.\n\nWhat about supported devices, though? HONOR has posted a roadmap on Weibo (see the machine-translated version above), and it turns out many 2023 and 2024 flagships, such as the Magic V3 and Magic 6 Pro, will get the software next month. However, the roadmap also confirms that plenty of older budget devices will eventually get the upgrade by March 2025.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this roadmap is only for China right now and the global roadmap will likely differ. But this still gives us a solid idea of what to expect when the global version of Magic OS 9.0 is released.\n\nGot a tip? Talk to us! Email our staff at Email our staff at news@androidauthority.com .

In addition to physical structures remaining from the ancient civilization, there were plenty of individual artifacts discovered, including ancient seals and cuneiform tablets.\n\nFor most archaeologists, discovering a single ancient artifact is probably a thrilling experience. Finding three? A monumental moment. 10? A dream come true.\n\nWhat about nearly 500?\n\nIs there a feeling that can even capture the magnitude? To find out, you\u2019d have to ask Quhtan Abbas Hassan Aboud, the lead on an archaeological excavation in Iraq\u2019s Babylon Governorate. In mid-October, the team\u2014working on a dig in the Al-Fayadiya district\u2014discovered a major section of ancient Babylon that spans two periods of the city\u2019s development. The find contained 478 artifacts from both periods, including ancient seals, cuneiform tablets, and more, according to Archaeology Magazine.\n\nThe team separated the discovery into two sections (A and B), according to a statement from the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage. Section A covered about 6,000 square meters of the excavation site, and within it, archaeologists found remains that represented two distinct time periods. The top layer dates back to the Sasanian period, which stretched from 224 to 651 A.D. during the reign of the Sasanian Empire\u2014one of the last pre-Islamic empires of Iran.\n\nUnfortunately, because they\u2019ve spent a millennium and a half much closer to the surface of the soil, the ruins of the empire suffered plenty of erosion and deterioration. So, while the discovery is key in tracing the history of ancient Babylon, it pales in comparison to what the archaeologists found underneath it.\n\nThe second layer of Section A was much more well-preserved and much, much older\u2014experts traced it back to the Old Babylonian era, which stretched from 1894 to 1595 B.C.\n\nHowever, the excitement around Section B far outshone that for either layer of the first section. Section B was notably larger than Section A, at about 9,000 square meters, and contained a massive bounty of Babylonian antiquities. The whole section dates back to the same era as the lower layer of Section A, and\u2014in addition to the individual artifacts like pottery and cylindrical seals\u2014Aboud\u2019s crew was able to map out what they believed to be residential homes.\n\nRelated Story Archaeologists Find New Ancient Board Game Tablets\n\nTwo housing units that the archaeologists uncovered contained multiple, various-sized rooms that could have served as living spaces, work areas, or storage, providing significant insight into the living habits and conditions of Old Babylon\u2019s common residents.\n\nThe smaller, individual pieces of history\u2014the pottery, writing tablets, seals, and more\u2014that were part of the discovery are just as important as the structures unearthed in the area. The cylindrical seals, for instance, were in pristine condition despite being over 3,000 years old. Once used to sign documents and denote ownership, seals were an important person item and were often ornately decorated. While they served a functional purpose, they also now serve as crucial pieces of the history of aesthetics and symbolism\u2014not just in Babylon, but across ancient Mesopotamia and the rest of the world.\n\nJust as important a find are the various cuneiform tablets. The logo-syllabic writing style is one of the earliest in civilized history, and translations of the ancient Babylonian tablets are essentially windows into the civilization\u2019s commerce, government, and other facets of life. They provide a direct path to better understanding the ancient city.\n\nBut then again, so does the entire discovery. How lucky."

Automation offers a solution. Robotic systems can perform experiments continuously without human fatigue, significantly speeding up research. Robots not only execute precise experimental steps with greater consistency than humans, they also reduce safety risks by handling hazardous substances. By automating routine tasks, scientists can focus on higher-level research questions, paving the way for faster breakthroughs in medicine, energy and sustainability.\n\n\u201cRobotics has the potential to turn our everyday science labs into automated \u2018factories\u2019 that accelerate discovery, but to do this, we need creative solutions to allow researchers and robots to collaborate in the same lab environment,\u201d said Dr. James Cahoon, a co-author of the paper and chair of the Department of Chemistry. \u201cWith continued development, we expect robotics and automation will improve the speed, precision and reproducibility of experiments across diverse instruments and disciplines, generating the data that artificial intelligence systems can analyze to guide further experimentation.\u201d\n\nThe researchers defined five levels of laboratory automation to illustrate how automation can evolve in science labs:\n\nAssistive Automation (A1): At this level, individual tasks, such as liquid handling, are automated while humans handle the majority of the work. Partial Automation (A2): Robots perform multiple sequential steps, with humans responsible for setup and supervision. Conditional Automation (A3): Robots manage entire experimental processes, though human intervention is required when unexpected events arise. High Automation (A4): Robots execute experiments independently, setting up equipment and reacting to unusual conditions autonomously. Full Automation (A5): At this final stage, robots and AI systems operate with complete autonomy, including self-maintenance and safety management.\n\nThe levels of automation defined by the researchers can be used to assess progress in the field, help in establishing appropriate safety protocols and set goals for future research in both science domains and robotics. Although lower levels of automation are common today, achieving high and full automation is a research challenge that will require robots capable of operating across different lab environments, handling complex tasks and interacting with humans and other automation systems seamlessly."

        "article_content": "Chicago is well-known for its tall buildings, deep-dish pizza, and rich history, but there\u2019s something else getting a lot of attention its exciting startup scene. Over the last few years, Chicago has become a hot spot for people with fresh ideas, bringing in entrepreneurs from around the world who want to kickstart their businesses.\n\nBut what makes Chicago\u2019s startup scene different from places like Silicon Valley or New York? Let\u2019s take a closer look at what makes this city stand out.\n\nLots of Support for Entrepreneurs\n\nOne of the best things about starting a business in Chicago is the amount of support entrepreneurs get. In some cities, new businesses are on their own, but not here. There are tons of resources, like incubators, accelerators, and shared workspaces, designed to help startups grow.\n\nPlaces like 1871 provide mentorship, office space, and chances to connect with others, which helps people build their businesses. Chicago\u2019s universities, like The University of Chicago and Northwestern University, also offer programs to teach young people how to become entrepreneurs.\n\nAnd when it comes to funding, Chicago has a lot of investors and venture capital firms that want to support new businesses, so entrepreneurs don\u2019t have to go far to find financial backing.\n\nA Diverse and Inclusive Startup Community\n\nChicago\u2019s startup scene stands out because it\u2019s open to everyone. Unlike other cities where certain groups might dominate, Chicago welcomes people from all backgrounds. This focus on diversity brings different perspectives and new ideas to the table.\n\nOrganizations like Chicago Blend help promote diversity in the tech and startup industries, offering resources to support underrepresented groups. This inclusive atmosphere makes the startup culture more creative and innovative.\n\nA Strong Community\n\nIn some cities, startups see each other as competition. But in Chicago, there\u2019s a strong sense of community. Entrepreneurs often work together, share ideas, and help each other succeed.\n\nEvents like Chicago Startup Week and Techstars Startup Weekend bring people together to learn, network, and collaborate. It\u2019s common to see more experienced entrepreneurs mentoring newer ones, sharing advice and offering support.\n\nThere\u2019s also a tradition of giving back in Chicago. Entrepreneurs who have been successful often invest in local businesses, mentor new founders, and create programs to encourage more people to start their own ventures.\n\n4. Solving Real-World Problems\n\nChicago\u2019s startups focus on solving real issues that affect people\u2019s daily lives. Instead of chasing the next big trend, many entrepreneurs in the city work on businesses that improve things like transportation, education, and healthcare.\n\nFor example, SpotHero, a parking app, and VillageMD, a healthcare company, are just two examples of businesses that aim to make life easier for people in the city and beyond. This approach gives Chicago a reputation for being a place where people tackle real challenges.\n\nAffordability and Access\n\nStarting a business in cities like New York or San Francisco can be super expensive. But in Chicago, things like rent, office space, and employee salaries are much more affordable. This gives startups more breathing room financially, allowing them to focus on growing their businesses without breaking the bank.\n\nChicago\u2019s location also makes it easy to connect with clients, investors, and partners across the country and around the world. Thanks to its transportation system and O\u2019Hare International Airport, Chicago is well-connected to major cities globally.\n\nHard Work Pays Off\n\nChicagoans are known for their strong work ethic, and this mindset is a big part of the city\u2019s startup culture. Entrepreneurs here aren\u2019t just in it for quick success they\u2019re willing to put in the hard work, face challenges, and keep going even when things get tough.\n\nThis determination and grit help Chicago startups stand out. They\u2019re not only innovative but also resilient, able to handle ups and downs and come out stronger on the other side.\n\nConclusion: A City of Opportunity\n\nChicago\u2019s startup scene is unique because it\u2019s supportive, diverse, community-focused, and centered on solving real problems. It\u2019s also more affordable than other big cities, making it a great place to start a business.\n\nWhether you\u2019re just starting out or looking to grow your business, Chicago offers everything you need to succeed. It\u2019s a city full of opportunity, where entrepreneurs can thrive and turn their ideas into reality. So, if you\u2019re ready to launch your next big idea, Chicago might just be the perfect place to do it."
