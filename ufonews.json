            "article_content": "With global interest in UFOs at an all-time high, particularly in the United States where mysterious drone sightings have been driving everyone crazy, two Israeli researchers have uncovered fascinating patterns in who reports these mysterious sightings \u2014 and when.\n\nTheir study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, reveals that UFO reports might tell us less about what\u2019s in the sky and more about what\u2019s happening on the ground, particularly in our bank accounts.\n\nOhad Raveh from Hebrew University and Nathan Goldstein from Bar-Ilan University were trying to solve an interesting puzzle: How can we measure what the public is paying attention to in different places and at different times? This is important for understanding the economy, but it\u2019s difficult to measure.\n\nThey looked at years of data cataloguing recorded sightings of UFOs \u2014 or as they refer to them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena).\n\nTheir assumption was that when people report seeing something strange in the sky, they\u2019re clearly paying attention to their surroundings. The researchers thought this could be a useful way to measure public attention.\n\n\u201c We set out to understand what the association is between attention given to the sky and attention given to the economy,\u201d explains Raveh.\n\nTwo contradictory findings?\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of reports from the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States and discovered that more wealthy areas consistently report more UFO sightings than less wealthy regions.\n\nRaveh and Goldstein initially believed that this phenomenon could be explained by understanding attention as a hierarchical system: you give attention to the most pressing issues before you worry about other things.\n\n\u201cOnce you give attention to the fundamental things, then you may give attention to things that are more luxurious,\u201d Raveh elaborates. \u201cAttention to the economy is a fundamental thing, because in the end that\u2019s what brings food to your table. But once you attend to that, then you have more time on your hands to start looking at the sky.\u201d\n\nSo, because people who are more financially secure can let their minds (and eyes) wander from their budgets, they\u2019re more likely to see UAPs, right?\n\nHowever, that theory runs into some turbulence when considering the second pattern they uncovered during their research: Across the board, both poor and wealthy areas saw an increase in UFO sightings during economic downturns \u2013 a pattern that caught the researchers by surprise.\n\n\u201c We thought that the two types of attention would be substitutable. Because attention is a limited resource, and if you give attention to, say, the sky, that would be at the expense of other types of attention that you can give to other factors like the economy,\u201d says Raveh. \u201cBut apparently it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: Wealthy areas generally report more UFOs than poor areas, but when any area hits hard economic times, UFO reports increase.\n\nTurns out rich people get to spend more time looking for aliens. Photo by Jonas Von Werne via Pexels\n\nIt\u2019s all about attention\n\nThis apparent contradiction makes sense when you realize UFO reports are really measuring how much attention people are paying to their surroundings.\n\nWealthy people generally have more free time and mental space to notice unusual things in the sky. But during economic downturns, people everywhere have more time on their hands (often due to job losses or reduced work hours) and thus spot more UFOs.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by what the researchers saw during Covid lockdowns: When people were forcibly given more free time (even if they weren\u2019t necessarily experiencing economic hardship), UFO sightings increased.\n\nOverall, the research findings serve as strong evidence that UFO/UAP sightings serve as a reliable indicator of public attention patterns, which opens new possibilities for understanding how public attention influences economic outcomes.\n\nOnly one question remains, though \u2014 have the researchers seen any UFOs themselves?\n\n\u201c I wish!\u201d jokes Raveh. \u201cActually, since we started to work, I\u2019ve tried to give more attention to the skies. But I haven\u2019t seen anything, unfortunately. I hope they visit Israel sometime.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

            "article_content": "In the vast skies over Wyoming, things aren\u2019t always as they seem. That\u2019s why the Cowboy State is one of the best places to see and possibly explain the unexplainable.\n\nThe National UFO Center keeps records of every sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) reported in the United States since 1995.\n\nThe website Stacker used that data to compile a list of the top 10 with the most reports of strange, inexplainable sights in the night sky.\n\nThe world of UFO and UAP sightings has gotten more serious in the last several years, and more people are looking up and looking for answers.\n\n\u201cI can tell you is that quite a few sightings in Wyoming remain unexplained,\u201d said Richard Beckwith, Rock Springs city attorney and part-time UFO investigator.\n\nHe\u2019s spent decades investigating UFO sightings in Wyoming, but had his first personal experience with one spotted near Green River earlier in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon is real,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the Pentagon has admitted UFOs and UAFs are real, and they can\u2019t explain them. It was treated as a joke for most of the time I\u2019ve been doing it, and now it\u2019s become real.\u201d\n\nThe List\n\nOverall, the National UFO Center has 421 reports of UFOs and UAFs in Wyoming. Cheyenne tops the list of Wyoming places with the most sightings, reporting 50 aerial phenomena since 1995.\n\nSeeing Cheyenne at the top doesn\u2019t surprise Beckwith at all. One would expect more sightings in Wyoming\u2019s most populated city, but Cheyenne is also home to a critical U.S. Air Force base.\n\n\u201cWyoming\u2019s UFO sightings, from my perspective, primarily appear over the Warren Air Force Base and the nearby missile silos,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been quite a few sightings, going back to the 1950s.\u201d\n\nCasper is second with 37 UFO sightings, followed by Laramie with 29, Rock Springs with 17 and Gillette with 15. Cody, Sheridan, Riverton and Evanston round out the bottom half of the list.\n\nYellowstone National Park sits at the bottom with eight UFO sightings. Sasquatch isn\u2019t the only elusive and mysterious thing hanging around the pristine wilderness of northwest Wyoming.\n\nThe state that\u2019s seen and reported the most UFOs is California, with more than 16,500 sightings. The Pentagon attributes most of these sightings to balloons, drones, aircraft and other terrestrial sources.\n\nOne thing Wyomingites won\u2019t want to do is try to shoot down any UFOs they spot. If that UFO happens to be a neighbor\u2019s drone, that would violate federal law and could come with a fine and a jail sentence .\n\nNot Explaining The Unexplainable\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that the number of sightings corresponds with Wyoming\u2019s most populated areas. Beckwith said that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been, but that doesn\u2019t make these phenomena any easier to explain.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, we had the simple explanation that these were aliens from another planet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the longer I\u2019ve done this, the explanations have become more elusive. It\u2019s much more complex than that.\u201d\n\nModern-day theories for UFOs and UAP include black technology programs, foreign espionage and astronomical events in addition to the extraterrestrial. If there are any probable explanations for what\u2019s been seen over Wyoming and elsewhere, the federal government has declined to comment or elaborate.\n\n\u201cThey continue to say emphatically that we have no evidence that these objects are extraterrestrial in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cThat begs the question \u2014 if they can\u2019t explain it, how can they determine that these objects are also simultaneously not manufactured elsewhere? It's almost like, \u2018Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.\u2019\u201d\n\nRecently, there have been three congressional hearings on UFOs and UAFs, and Beckwith said he\u2019s spoken with two members of U.S. Congress about the phenomenon. Wyoming scientists are skeptical of their findings, but Beckwith described it as one of the rare bipartisan issues that has reached Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPeople who looked at this phenomenon were ridiculed about this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s changed since 2017, now that the government has admitted they\u2019re real.\u201d\n\nWyoming Watchers\n\nBeckwith is one of four Wyoming field investigators for the Mutual UFO Network, an organization of civilian volunteers that follow up on and report UFO and UAF sightings. The number of investigators shows Beckwith how much interest has grown for these unexplainable phenomena in the last decade.\n\n\u201cI have investigators in Cheyenne, Riverton, and two in Rock Springs that investigate sightings all over the state,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil a couple of years ago, I was the only one.\u201d\n\nBeckwith described his first experience with a UFO back in March. He used his Sony SR4 camera to capture a video of \u201canomalous nocturnal lights\u201d hovering near Green River.\n\n\u201cI got the radar records from that night, but haven\u2019t been able to correlate what I saw with any particular targets on the radar,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly didn't have a transponder. So, to that extent, I can't explain it. But I saw and filmed it.\u201d\n\nBeckwith hopes more Wyomingites will report any UFO or UAF sightings to the National UFO Center or the Mutual UFO Network. Regardless of what people believe they've seen in the sky, he and many others want answers.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of space and open sky in Wyoming. Beckwith believes the Cowboy State could be the key to getting better data and information to shine more light into the darkness surrounding UFOs and UAFs.\n\n\u201cWyoming is the ninth-largest state in land area, and we have the lowest population,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, we have sightings with several witnesses in different locations. They\u2019re rarer than other places, but they still occur.\u201d\n\nAndrew Rossi can be reached at arossi@cowboystatedaily.com."

            "article_content": "It\u2019s a weird time to be a UFO enthusiast \u2014 especially one who finds lights in the sky inspiring rather than frightening. As real-life conspiracy theories flourish and big screen space horror is set lightyears away, I find myself contextualizing my UFO feelings in a surprisingly rural story. To me, the quintessential UFO horror movie is M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s 2002 film Signs.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nSigns is a sci-fi thriller set on a farm in rural Pennsylvania, starring Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix as brothers Graham and Merrill Hess. For what it\u2019s worth, if you haven\u2019t seen this movie you may still be familiar with the parody Scary Movie 3. However, if you\u2019re around my age you may also remember Signs as the first time you consciously thought of UFOs as frightening rather than fascinating. The movie tells an original story while still playing with the archetypal concept of UFOs in American pop culture.\n\nThe movie begins by tackling a hot topic in the Ufology community: crop circles. In real life, these have mostly been debunked as pranks, contrivances or environmental coincidences, and in the movie the Hess family brushes them off first as well. Instead, the beginning of the movie focuses on their family struggles \u2014 Graham was an Episcopal priest until his wife died in a car crash about six months ago, and he lost his faith. Merrill\u2019s minor league baseball career stopped short and now he is here on the farm trying to help his brother, niece and nephew all process their grief.\n\nIn the midst of this, crop circles begin to take over the mainstream news, and they get harder and harder for Graham and Merrill to ignore. The brothers begin to see strange figures appearing in their field but they\u2019re unable to catch them. They also hear odd, inhuman noises through a baby monitor. Before they know it, a worldwide alien invasion is underway.\n\nAside from the Hess brothers, the key cast members are Graham\u2019s son Morgan (Rory Culkin) and his daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin). They are also visited by their friend and local police officer Caroline Paski (Cherry Jones) and their neighbor Ray Reddy, who is played by Shyamalan himself. Behind the scenes, the credits were stacked as well \u2014 producers included Kathleen Kennedy, Frank Marshall and Sam Mercer.\n\nSigns was filmed in Pennsylvania on a budget of $72 million, and was considered a box office success with an international gross of over $408 million. It was Shyamalan\u2019s second-biggest earner at the time behind The Sixth Sense. The movie also sold well on VHS and DVD, and is beloved by film buffs for its extensive bonus content including deleted scenes, documentary featurettes and storyboards. This movie alone earned nearly $35 million in DVD rental revenue between January and March of 2003.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Signs has a 75 percent fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.9 out of 10 among 240 trusted critics. Those that loved the film praised its pacing, suspense and jump scares while those who disliked it questioned its approach to collective terror in the wake if the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That last issue may be part of the reason Signs has seemed to age well \u2014 when its allowed to be considered outside of that context, it feels more authentic.\n\nAs for its take on the aliens themselves, Signs is far from the scariest. However, it does what other space horrors fail to do in making the danger feel close to home \u2014 like it could happen to you just as you leave the theater. The logical part of my mind knows I\u2019d have a better chance against the creatures from Signs than I would against that thing from Alien: Romulus, yet the emotional response comes from seeing the alien in an earthly home rather than a distant space station.\n\nSome viewers complain that the ending of Signs is abrupt and contrived. Without spoiling anything, I can say I hope the headlines about drone sightings and military UAP disclosures turn out to have simple endings as well. At the time of this writing, Signs is not available on any subscription-based streamers, but it is on PVOD stores as well as physical media."

            "article_content": "> Tech\n\nA viral video reshared by Myra Moore, who goes by \u2018The Paranormal Chic\u2019 on social media, shows several beings brooding over the canopy of clouds.\n\nThe entities captured on film by a passenger on a commercial airline show them casting shadows as well, sparking curiosity among netizens. At the cursory glance, the video doesn\u2019t appear to be digitally altered or produced with any AI tools. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there,\u201d the narrator quipped. Humans cannot (if it isn\u2019t obvious) stand on clouds. They cannot stand over a sea of clouds either without some mechanism involving the modern technological marvel of parachutes, gliders, or planes. Are there entities out there? Or the aliens are just being too brazenly out in the open now? Or is there a sinister supernatural angle to the story?\n\nEven as the Internet debated, the mystery was quickly solved by online sleuths who presented evidence debunking the claim that the alleged beings on the video are sentients. Others took hilarious jibes on the video. Meanwhile, a few netizens shared similar shots from their own travels earlier. Per some, the figures are nothing but cloud stakes or pillar formations that stand out of the fluffy layer. A few suggested that these could also be smoke released from factory chimneys.\n\nMost likely industrial stacks pushing up warm moist air through the cloud bank.

            "article_content": "Viral Video: A new video circulating on social media has ignited wild speculation and widespread curiosity, as a mysterious sighting captured by a passenger on a commercial flight is stirring up online chatter. The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there. What did they capture?\"\n\nCheck Out the Viral Video\n\nSince then, the video has gone viral, sparking a mix of reactions. Some viewers suggest that the figures could merely be people in a snowy landscape, while others propose more outlandish theories, including the idea that the sight could be steam rising from industrial gases or fog.\n\nA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?#theparanormalchic #alien #airline #paranormal #ufo #fyp pic.twitter.com/CARF6XFGxD \u2014 Myra Moore- The Paranormal Chic (@t_paranorm_chic) December 30, 2024\n\nThe clip\u2019s lack of clear location and timing has only added to the mystery, leaving many to wonder whether the sighting could have an otherworldly explanation. \"What did they capture?\" Moore asked, encouraging her followers to share their opinions and theories. The video has since gone viral on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where users are divided between humorous interpretations and more serious discussions about the potential implications of the footage.\n\nUsers Reaction to the Viral Post\n\nThe most conclusive explanation of the video was given by a twitter user with an image and he said that, \u201cIt is a fog layer, and you are seeing steam rising from exhaust stacks.\u201d\n\nAnother one said, \u201cThat\u2019s wild.

The footage, showing shadowy figures in the clouds, has left viewers both intrigued and baffled, fueling debates across the internet.The video, shot by a passenger in a commercial plane, first shows, what seems like, two human beings standing on a cloud. Not just that, the camera then pans to show several such human-like shapes standing on clouds. The clip was posted by Myra Moore, a content creator who identifies as a paranormal expert and has since received about 5 million views. The caption of the post reads as follows, \u201cA passenger on a commercial airline captures what appears to be multiple beings standing on cloud cover, what is going on?\u201dIn the video, Myra explains that the video was shot by a passenger on a plane. \u201cThey were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it? It couldn\u2019t possibly be humans out there. What did they capture,\u201d she continued.Reacting to the post, one user commented, \u201cThis is crazy, is that aliens or humans in the cloud?\" However, some were a little more skeptical, \u201cWhy does the person with the camera keep panning around? Why can't they focus on those \"people\" and see if they move or see what they are doing?\u201d Some even straight-up called this a creation of AI, \u201cEveryone is getting fooled so hard by AI! If you haven\u2019t seen it in the last 30-40 years, then it\u2019s probably AI!\u201dOne user in the comment section reasoned that maybe what one can see in the video is an interplay of light, shadows, and human imagination. The human mind tries to find patterns and assigns meaning to random shapes\u2014a phenomenon known as pareidolia, where we see familiar forms, such as faces or figures, in otherwise abstract visuals. It is thus suggested, to not spread fear based on such videos until they are not authenticated."

And it was so surreal \u2013 a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he said.\n\n\u00a9 Agence France-Presse"

            "article_content": "Back in May, OpenAI said it was developing a tool to let creators specify how they want their works to be included in \u2014 or excluded from \u2014 its AI training data. But seven months later, this feature has yet to see the light of day.\n\nCalled Media Manager, the tool would \u201cidentify copyrighted text, images, audio, and video,\u201d OpenAI said at the time, to reflect creators\u2019 preferences \u201cacross multiple sources.\u201d It was intended to stave off some of the company\u2019s fiercest critics, and potentially shield OpenAI from IP-related legal challenges.\n\nBut people familiar tell TechCrunch that the tool was rarely viewed as an important launch internally. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a priority,\u201d one former OpenAI employee said. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember anyone working on it.\u201d\n\nA non-employee who coordinates work with the company told TechCrunch in December that they had discussed the tool with OpenAI in the past, but that there haven\u2019t been any recent updates. (These people declined to be publicly identified discussing confidential business matters.)\n\nAnd a member of OpenAI\u2019s legal team who was working on Media Manager, Fred von Lohmann, transitioned to a part-time consultant role in October. OpenAI PR confirmed Von Lohmann\u2019s move to TechCrunch via email.\n\nOpenAI has yet to give an update on Media Manager\u2019s progress, and the company missed a self-imposed deadline to have the tool in place \u201cby 2025.\u201d (To be clear, \u201cby 2025\u201d could be read as inclusive of the year 2025, but TechCrunch interpreted OpenAI\u2019s language to mean leading up to January 1, 2025.)\n\nIP issues\n\nAI models like OpenAI\u2019s learn patterns in sets of data to make predictions \u2014 for instance, that a person biting into a burger will leave a bite mark. This allows models to learn how the world works, to a degree, by observing it. ChatGPT can write convincing emails and essays, while Sora, OpenAI\u2019s video generator, can create relatively realistic footage.\n\nThe ability to draw on examples of writing, film, and more to generate new works makes AI incredibly powerful. But it\u2019s also regurgitative. When prompted in a certain way, models \u2014 most of which are trained on countless web pages, videos, and images \u2014 produce near-copies of that data, which despite being \u201cpublicly available,\u201d are not meant to be used this way.\n\nFor example, Sora can generate clips featuring TikTok\u2019s logo and popular video game characters. The New York Times has gotten ChatGPT to quote its articles verbatim (OpenAI blamed the behavior on a \u201chack\u201c).\n\nThis has understandably upset creators whose works have been swept up in AI training without their permission. Many have lawyered up.\n\nOpenAI is fighting class action lawsuits filed by artists, writers, YouTubers, computer scientists, and news organizations, all of whom claim the startup trained on their works illegally. Plaintiffs include authors Sarah Silverman and Ta Nehisi-Coates, visual artists, and media conglomerates like The New York Times and Radio-Canada, to name a few.\n\nOpenAI has pursued licensing deals with select partners, but not all creators see the terms as attractive.\n\nManaging media\n\nOpenAI offers creators several ad hoc ways to \u201copt out\u201d of its AI training. Last September, the company launched a submission form to allow artists to flag their work for removal from its future training sets. And OpenAI has long let webmasters block its web-crawling bots from scraping data across their domains.\n\nBut creators have criticized these methods as haphazard and inadequate. There aren\u2019t specific opt-out mechanisms for written works, videos, or audio recordings. And the opt-out form for images requires submitting a copy of each image to be removed along with a description, an onerous process.\n\nMedia Manager was pitched as a complete revamp \u2014 and expansion \u2014 of OpenAI\u2019s opt-out solutions today.\n\nIn the announcement post in May, OpenAI said that Media Manager would use \u201ccutting-edge machine learning research\u201d to enable creators and content owners to \u201ctell [OpenAI] what they own.\u201d OpenAI, which claimed it was collaborating with regulators as it developed the tool, said that it hoped Media Manager would \u201cset a standard across the AI industry.\u201d\n\nOpenAI has never publicly mentioned Media Manager since.\n\nA spokesperson told TechCrunch that the tool was \u201cstill in development\u201d as of August, but didn\u2019t respond to a follow-up request for comment in mid-December.\n\nOpenAI has given no indication as to when Media Manager might launch \u2014 or even which features and capabilities it might launch with.\n\nFair use\n\nAssuming Media Manager does arrive at some point, experts aren\u2019t convinced that it will allay creators\u2019 concerns \u2014 or do much to resolve the legal questions surrounding AI and IP usage.\n\nAdrian Cyhan, an IP attorney at Stubbs Alderton & Markiles, noted that Media Manager as described is an ambitious undertaking. Even platforms as large as YouTube and TikTok struggle with content ID at scale. Could OpenAI really do better?\n\n\u201cEnsuring compliance with legally required creator protections and potential compensation requirements under consideration presents challenges,\u201d Cyhan told TechCrunch, \u201cespecially given the rapidly-evolving and potentially divergent legal landscape across national and local jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nEd Newton-Rex, the founder of Fairly Trained, a nonprofit that certifies AI companies are respecting creators\u2019 rights, believes that Media Manager would unfairly shift the burden of controlling AI training onto creators; by not using it, they arguably could be giving tacit approval for their works to be used. \u201cMost creators will never even hear about it, let alone use it,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cBut it will nevertheless be used to defend the mass exploitation of creative work against creators\u2019 wishes.\u201d\n\nMike Borella, co-chair of MBHB\u2019s AI practice group, pointed out that opt-out systems don\u2019t always account for transformations that might be made to a work, like an image that\u2019s been downsampled. They also might not address the all-to-common scenario of third-party platforms hosting copies of creators\u2019 content, added Joshua Weigensberg, an IP and media lawyer for Pryor Cashman.\n\n\u201cCreators and copyright owners do not control, and often do not even know, where their works appear on the internet,\u201d Weigensberg said. \u201cEven if a creator tells every single AI platform that they are opting out of training, those companies may well still go ahead and train on copies of their works available on third-party websites and services.\u201d\n\nMedia Manager might not even be especially advantageous for OpenAI, at least from a jurisprudential standpoint. Evan Everist, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney specializing in copyright law, said that while OpenAI could use the tool to show a judge it\u2019s mitigating its training on IP-protected content, Media Manager likely wouldn\u2019t shield the company from damages if it was found to have infringed.\n\n\u201cCopyright owners do not have an obligation to go out and preemptively tell others not to infringe their works before that infringement occurs,\u201d Everist said. \u201cThe basics of copyright law still apply \u2014 i.e., don\u2019t take and copy other people\u2019s stuff without permission. This feature may be more about PR and positioning OpenAI as an ethical user of content.\u201d\n\nA reckoning\n\nIn the absence of Media Manager, OpenAI has implemented filters \u2014 albeit imperfect ones \u2014 to prevent its models from regurgitating training examples. And in the lawsuits it\u2019s battling, the company continues to claim fair use protections, asserting that its models create transformative, not plagiaristic, works.\n\nOpenAI could well prevail in its copyright disputes.\n\nThe courts may decide that the company\u2019s AI has a \u201ctransformative purpose,\u201d following the precedent set roughly a decade ago in the publishing industry\u2019s suit against Google. In that case, a court held that Google\u2019s copying of millions of books for Google Books, a sort of digital archive, was permissible.\n\nOpenAI has said publicly that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to train competitive AI models without using copyrighted materials \u2014 authorized or no. \u201cLimiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today\u2019s citizens,\u201d the company wrote in a January submission to the U.K.\u2019s House of Lords.\n\nShould courts eventually declare OpenAI victorious, Media Manager wouldn\u2019t serve much of a legal purpose. OpenAI seems to be willing to make that bet \u2014 or to reconsider its opt-out strategy.\n\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter! Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday."

            "article_content": "OpenAI held a massive ChatGPT-centric event before Christmas, making several key announcements for ChatGPT and other genAI tools it currently offers. The reasoning ChatGPT model o1 and the text-to-video Sora service got public releases. OpenAI also demoed the o3 model coming later this year, released Canvas, and even made ChatGPT available via WhatsApp texting.\n\nWhat OpenAI failed to do is keep a privacy promise made earlier this year. The company announced a Media Manager feature back in May. The tool is meant to allow creators of all sorts of content to opt out of ChatGPT and other genAI models training.\n\nOpenAI said Media Manager will be available by 2025, but that hasn\u2019t happened. Not only that, but the company might not be actively working on the feature, and there\u2019s no telling when it will come out.\n\nTraining models like ChatGPT require lots of data so the AI can learn to predict what the user needs. OpenAI uses all sorts of data from the internet to train its AI, including copyright content from creators it didn\u2019t obtain access to. Several creators sued the company after finding their works were used to train the AI.\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\n\nMedia Manager should be a tool that lets creators opt out of training for all sorts of media content, not just written text. OpenAI described Media Manager as a cutting-edge tool to protect user privacy:\n\nThis will require cutting-edge machine learning research to build a first-ever tool of its kind to help us identify copyrighted text, images, audio, and video across multiple sources and reflect creator preferences.\n\nWhile that sounded great on paper, we have all forgotten about it. OpenAI has not mentioned Media Manager since May, and development for the privacy tool might not have advanced. Says TechCrunch, which talked to people familiar with the project.\n\nThe blog has learned that Media Manager was rarely viewed as an important project internally. A former OpenAI employee told TechCrunch that Media Manager wasn\u2019t a priority. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember anyone working on it,\u201d they said.\n\nAlso, a person who doesn\u2019t work at OpenAI but coordinates work with the AI firm said they discussed the tool with the company but haven\u2019t received any updates.\n\nTechCrunch also notes that an OpenAI legal team member involved with Media Manager transitioned to a part-time consultant role.\n\nNone of this comes directly from OpenAI. Insiders who shared information might not have access to the bigger picture. But even if TechCrunch\u2019s information isn\u2019t accurate, there\u2019s still the fact that OpenAI has been quiet on the Media Manager feature for half a year.\n\nIf it were finished, the privacy tool could have easily been a \u201c12 Days\u201d announcement. At the very least, OpenAI could have updated the timeline.\n\nA more cynical view is that OpenAI is biding its time. Recent reports said that training next-gen ChatGPT versions isn\u2019t working as planned. OpenAI saw delays for GPT-5, and access to better-quality training data might be one factor impacting development. Copyrighted content that makes it into AI training data could be better quality than other types of content. I\u2019m just speculating here.\n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at is that a Media Manager tool might be released eventually, maybe once the copyright lawsuits against OpenAI are concluded and the company knows exactly what it can and can\u2019t do when training new AI models. Who knows if Media Manager might be needed once that happens. Also, ChatGPT\u2019s GPT-5 upgrade might get out of development and closer to release by then.\n\nFinally, even if Media Manager were available, it would still require some work from creators to flag out copyrighted content that should not train the AI. Despite that, copyright content might be found in all sorts of places on the internet that creators would not flag. OpenAI would crawl those places and the content might still make it into training data sets.\n\nMedia Manager delays aside; regular ChatGPT users have privacy settings at their disposal to opt out of having the data in their prompts train the AI."

            "article_content": "An app's performance is key to make users want to use it, say Meta engineers Dave LaMacchia and Jason Patterson. This includes making the app lightning-fast, battery-efficient, and reliable across a range of devices and connectivity conditions.\n\nTo improve Threads performance, Meta engineers measured how fast the app launches, how easy it is to post a photo or video, how often it crashes, and how many bug reports people filed. To this aim, they defined a number of metrics: frustrating image-render experience (FIRE), time-to-network content (TTNC), and creation-publish success rate (cPSR).\n\nFIRE is the percentage of people who experience a frustrating image-render experience, which may lead to them leaving the app while the image is rendering across the network. Roughly, FIRE is defined as the quotient of the number of users leaving the app before an image is fully rendered by the sum of all users attempting to display that image. Measuring this metric allows Threads developers to detect any regressions in how images are loading for users.\n\nTime-to-network content (TTNC) is roughly the time required for the app to launch and display the user's feed. Long loading time is another experience killer that may lead users to abandon the app. Reducing the app's binary size is paramount to keeping the binary small:\n\nEvery time someone tries to commit code to Threads, they\u2019re alerted if that code change would increase our app\u2019s binary size above a configured threshold.\n\nAdditionally, they removed unnecessary code and graphics assets from the app bundle, resulting in a binary one-quarter the size of Instagram.\n\nAs to navigation latency, this is possibly even more critical than launch time. Meta engineers carried through A/B tests to find out that:\n\nWith the smallest latency injection, the impact was small or negligible for some views, but the largest injections had negative effects across the board. People would read fewer posts, post less often themselves, and in general interact less with the app.\n\nTo ensure that no changes cause a regression in navigation latency, Meta engineers created SLATE, a logger system that tracks relevant events like triggers of a new navigation, the UI being built, activity spinners, and content from the network or an error being displayed.\n\nIt\u2019s implemented using a set of common components that are the foundation for a lot of our UI and a system that measures performance by setting \u201cmarkers\u201d in code for specific events. Typically these markers are created with a specific purpose in mind.\n\nCreation-publish success rate (cPSR) measures how likely it is for an user to successfully complete the process of posting some content. On iOS, posting a video or large photo is especially tricky, since the user could background the app after posting their content without waiting for the upload to complete, in which case the app may be terminated by the OS.\n\nHere, the approach taken by Meta was aimed at improving the user experience in those cases when posting failed. This was accomplished by introducing a new feature, called Drafts, to allow users to manage failed posts in more flexible ways instead of just providing the option to retry or abort the operation.\n\nWe discovered that 26 percent fewer people submitted bug reports about posting if they had Drafts. The feature was clearly making a difference.\n\nAnother approach was trying to reduce perceived latency, as opposed to absolute latency, showing a request has been received when the data upload completes but before it\u2019s been processed and published.\n\nLast but not least, Meta engineers saw a great improvement in app stability after they adopted Swift's complete concurrency, which, they say, does a great job at preventing data races and reducing hard-to-debug problems caused by data races."

            "article_content": "Currently, Riyadh has become the center of innovation in the mobile app industry given the fast-growing digital world. The flow of decisions made through modern technologies is aggressively fading barriers and offering tailor-made solutions aimed at meeting the new trends of consumer demand across industries. As the market for mobile app development continues to grow rapidly in KSA, it triggers organizations to expand and implement innovations as a means of providing value-added solutions as well as improving the app user interface.\n\nIn this blog, let me discuss some of the trending technologies in mobile apps that are changing the mobile app development in Riyadh and that\u2019s why it is important to choose the right mobile application development company in Riyadh.\n\nTop 10 Technologies in Mobile App Development in Riyadh Saudi Arabia\n\nHere in this section, you will get to know the top most famous and reliable Technologies in mobile app development.\n\n1. AI and Machine Learning Integration\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are probably among the most revolutionary technologies defining the mobile app environment. The apps that are based on AI are those that offer receptionists, intelligent recommendation systems, and analytical systems. Currently, almost every business in Riyadh incorporates AI in their applications in terms of chatbots; image recognition, and Predictive Analytics. Thus, these capabilities may help companies to raise user satisfaction and optimize the decision-making mechanism.\n\nExample Use Cases in Riyadh:\n\nRetail apps provide tailored shopping experiences.\n\nHealthcare apps offering AI-powered symptom analysis.\n\nFor such features to be incorporated effectively it is important to hire mobile app developers in Riyadh who have specialized in AI and ML.\n\n2. Blockchain for Secure Transactions\n\nBlockchain technology is in demand due to the efficiency it has in regards to providing an accountable and secure transaction. This is incredibly helpful in financial and medical industries as well as distribution services. Application development companies based in Riyadh are increasingly adopting blockchain to facilitate secure payment platforms, dApps, as well as supply chain solutions and services.\n\nBenefits of Blockchain in Mobile Apps:\n\nEnhanced data security and reduced fraud risk.\n\nStreamlined peer-to-peer transactions for digital payments.\n\nAs more individuals and companies adopt blockchain technology, the ability to align with a reliable hire of an Android app development company in Saudi Arabia will guarantee companies the benefits of blockchain technology.\n\n3. Internet of Things (IoT) in App Development\n\nInnovation in the IoT field is changing how the application communicates with connected devices. As Riyadh is more focused on smart city development, the Internet of thing-based mobile applications have gained much popularity. Such applications allow the devices to share information, make them smarter as well as help to make the systems better.\n\nKey IoT Applications:\n\nSmart home control apps.\n\nIndustrial automation and asset tracking.\n\nDevelopers from mobile app development services in Saudi Arabia are creating IoT applications and platforms to satisfy the increasing need for the Internet of Things in the region.\n\n4. AR and VR for Immersive Experiences\n\nMobile application consumers are rapidly gravitating towards Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) solutions. Indeed, technology constitutes a relatively significant element for industries such as the property market, schools, and gaming industries, among others. In Riyadh now, AR and VR are applied to provide experiences, for example, the virtual property tour or learning environment.\n\nIf you have intentions to utilize AR and VR features for the app you create, you may address any of the mobile app development companies in Riyadh based on your experience.\n\n5. 5G Technology for Enhanced Connectivity\n\n5G technology is rapidly becoming the new standard for mobile connectivity through the optimization of the connection\u2019s and application\u2019s speed and efficiency.

This guide by Christian Peverelli provides a detailed roadmap to help you create and monetize a no-code AI business focused on resume optimization for job seekers. By addressing a specific problem, using no-code platforms, and targeting the right audience, you can develop a functional and revenue-generating product in a short timeframe.\n\nChristian Peverelli takes you behind the scenes of a whirlwind 3 day journey, showing how a simple yet impactful idea\u2014an AI-powered resume optimization tool\u2014was transformed into a functional, revenue-generating product. Whether you\u2019re an aspiring entrepreneur, a tech enthusiast, or just someone curious about how to bring an idea to life, you\u2019ll find actionable insights here. From brainstorming and branding to building and selling, this guide breaks down the process step by step, offering a roadmap to help you create your own no-code business.\n\nCreating an AI Business\n\nTL;DR Key Takeaways : Identified a clear problem: Job seekers struggle with resume customization, addressed by an AI-powered resume optimization tool with a freemium model.\n\nBuilt a strong brand (\u201cGet Get Job\u201d) with professional branding elements and a user-focused landing page to attract and convert users.\n\nDeveloped the product using no-code platforms like Bolt, Supabase, and Make.com, allowing rapid creation without coding expertise.\n\nAcquired customers through LinkedIn outreach, using tools like Outbond and Smartlead, and offered discounted plans to attract early adopters.\n\nAchieved profitability within 72 hours, generating $348 in revenue against $110 in costs, showcasing the feasibility of launching a no-code AI business quickly.\n\n1: Identify the Problem and Validate Your Idea\n\nThe foundation of any successful business lies in solving a real-world problem. In this case, the challenge was clear: job seekers often struggle to tailor their resumes to specific job descriptions. This process is not only time-consuming but also tedious, leaving many job seekers frustrated. The solution? An AI-powered resume optimization tool that simplifies and streamlines this task.\n\nThe target audience was identified as active job seekers, particularly those using platforms like LinkedIn. These individuals could benefit significantly from a tool that automates resume customization. To validate the idea, a freemium business model was chosen. This model offered basic features for free while charging $29 per month (or discounted annual plans) for premium features. This pricing strategy ensured accessibility while providing a clear path to revenue generation.\n\n2: Build a Strong Brand\n\nA strong and cohesive brand identity is critical for building trust and attracting users, especially in the early stages of a business. The business was named \u201cGet Get Job,\u201d a memorable and relevant name that resonated with the target audience. Branding elements such as a professional logo, a consistent color palette, and a user-friendly landing page were created using tools like Namecheap, Luca, and Coolors.\n\nThe landing page played a pivotal role as the primary point of interaction with potential users. It clearly outlined the product\u2019s features, benefits, and pricing structure, making it easier to convert visitors into users. A well-designed landing page is not just a marketing tool; it is the cornerstone of any successful online business, as it establishes credibility and communicates value effectively.\n\nBuild a Profitable AI Business in 72 Hours (No-Coding)\n\nEnhance your knowledge on AI business optimization by exploring a selection of articles and guides on the subject.\n\n3: Develop the Product Without Coding\n\nThanks to advancements in no-code platforms, creating a functional product without writing a single line of code is now possible. For this project, the app was built using Bolt, a no-code app builder, while automation workflows were implemented through Make.com. Supabase was used to handle backend tasks such as user authentication and data storage.\n\nThe core functionality of the product revolved around solving the identified problem. Users could upload their resumes, link job descriptions, and receive AI-generated, optimized resumes tailored to specific roles. This feature directly addressed the pain point of resume customization, offering a practical and valuable solution for job seekers. By using no-code tools, the development process was not only faster but also more cost-effective, allowing the focus to remain on delivering a high-quality user experience.\n\n4: Acquire Customers\n\nWith the product ready, the next step was to attract users. LinkedIn emerged as the ideal platform for outreach due to its large base of job seekers. Tools like Outbond and Smartlead were used for lead generation, contact enrichment, and email automation. These tools enabled personalized communication at scale, making it easier to connect with potential users.\n\nTo incentivize early adopters, discounted annual plans were offered. This strategy not only encouraged sign-ups but also provided valuable feedback for refining the product. Early customer acquisition often involves unscalable, hands-on efforts, such as personalized outreach and direct engagement. While these methods can be time-intensive, they are crucial for validating the business model and building an initial user base.\n\n5: Overcome Challenges\n\nLaunching a business in such a short timeframe is not without its challenges. Technical issues, such as database integration and automation workflow errors, required troubleshooting and persistence. These obstacles underscored the importance of adaptability and problem-solving skills in the startup process.\n\nOperational challenges also arose, including managing outreach campaigns and responding to user inquiries. These tasks demanded significant time and effort but were essential for securing initial customers and establishing a foundation for growth. Overcoming these hurdles required a combination of strategic planning, resourcefulness, and a willingness to learn from setbacks.\n\n6: Measure Results\n\nDespite the challenges, the project achieved profitability within the 72-hour timeframe. Two sales were made, generating $348 in revenue against $110 in costs, resulting in a profit of $238. This outcome demonstrated the feasibility of launching a profitable no-code AI business quickly and efficiently. By focusing on a specific problem and using the right tools, it is possible to achieve tangible results in a short period.\n\nTools and Platforms That Made It Possible\n\nThe success of this project was made possible by a variety of tools and platforms, each playing a crucial role in different aspects of the business:\n\nAI and Automation: Make.com, ChatGPT, Dumpling API.\n\nMake.com, ChatGPT, Dumpling API.

This upper-level pattern is going to pull down much colder air than we saw at the end of December and the start of the new year.\n\nWith the new year and a new month upon us, our first weekend of January is looking calm and tranquil \u2014 although it will be cold. If you\u2019re looking to partake in outdoor activities, at least you won\u2019t have to worry about any snow or ice.\n\nTemperatures on Friday will be mostly in the 30s across New England. Boston Globe\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriday will be the least cold day with temperatures reaching the mid- to upper 30s, but the wind will make it feel a lot colder. Morning wind chills will be in the upper teens to 20s.\n\nLook for highs only reaching around 30 degrees on Saturday and Sunday. The wind will continue to be gusty throughout the weekend, knocking wind chills back into the teens and perhaps even single digits first thing in the morning.\n\nWind chills on Saturday will keep temperatures feeling bitterly cold. Boston Globe\n\nHighs will hover around 30 degrees on Saturday in Boston. Boston Globe\n\nBoston should stick around 30 degrees on Sunday with colder temperatures north and west of the the city. Boston Globe\n\nThe cold will cause an icy layer on many lakes and ponds, although it will not be at its required 4 inches or greater depth for safety just yet. Older ice is also weaker, so we have to wait for the new ice to form and grow for the greatest support.\n\nSaturday morning will also mark something we call \u201cperihelion.\u201d This is when the Earth is at its closest to the sun as our planet follows its elliptical orbit orbit. This may seem counter-intuitive since it\u2019s the coldest time of the year, but the angle of the sun is much more important than the changing distance throughout the year.\n\nBut the good news is this weekend means our sunrises start getting earlier, so now we are gaining time in both the afternoon and the morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeekend breakdown\n\nSouthern New England: Look for breezy and cold conditions throughout the weekend with temperatures around 30 degrees, starting near 20 each morning.\n\nWestern Mass.: Look for partly the mostly cloudy skies this weekend with temperatures in the 20s. The winds will continue to be gusty especially in the afternoon both days.\n\nCape and Islands: Look for blustery conditions both Saturday and Sunday. Temperatures will reach near freezing but start in the 20s each morning.\n\nNorthern New England: Wind will be the main weather feature this weekend along with colder temperatures. Readings will be in the 20s during the day and single digits and teens at night."

            "article_content": "It's been a topsy-turvy year for Super Micro Computer (SMCI -1.41%). Once seen as the next big artificial intelligence (AI) stock, it has come crashing down to reality in recent months due to concerns about the reliability of its numbers and accounting controls.\n\nHowever, after hitting a low of $17.25 on Nov. 15 on concerns that it could get delisted from the Nasdaq exchange, the stock has rallied heavily, and recently traded at about $30. With a new auditor in place and a plan to file its financials (which are late) by February, investors appear to be much more at ease with the stock these days.\n\nBut while you might be tempted to buy into the rally, there's still significant risk here, and multiple reasons the stock could be due for a big pullback in 2025.\n\nIs Super Micro's growth rate starting to slow down?\n\nWhen it comes to AI stocks, the name of the game is growth. Super Micro has experienced significant demand for its servers and storage products as companies race to develop AI models.\n\nSince the company is still transitioning to a new auditor, it hasn't posted a full set of quarterly numbers since August. In November, however, the company did release preliminary results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Sept. 30). What was a bit concerning is that Super Micro projects net sales to be within a range of $5.9 billion to $6 billion. That's considerably lower than its previous estimate, which projected sales of between $6 billion and $7 billion. These aren't final numbers, but it looks like a significant miss, and it raises questions about whether the business is seeing a slowdown in demand.\n\nEven if Super Micro does release its financials in a timely fashion, that doesn't mean that the results will necessarily be great or what investors will want to see. While $6 billion in sales would still represent an incredible increase of 183% year over year, the problem is that Super Micro's gross margins still remain incredibly low.\n\nGreater controls and procedures could squeeze Super Micro's thin profit margins\n\nTo alleviate concerns about accounting controls and procedures, it seems inevitable that Super Micro may need to hire more staff and spend money on implementing additional protocols to help maintain the accuracy and integrity of its financials.\n\nThat additional overhead could mean that Super Micro's profit margins will become even narrower. The tighter those margins are, the less benefit the company gets from any incremental dollar of revenue. In its preliminary numbers for Q1, Super Micro's gross margin was just 13.3%. While that's technically an improvement from the 11.2% it reported a quarter earlier, that's still dreadfully low -- and gross margin comes before overhead and other indirect expenses. The company's actual profit margin will be even narrower.\n\nThis will be the key metric that investors will want to focus on when Super Micro finally reports its full quarterly results -- what its profit margin looks like after factoring in all the changes it has made. If margins deteriorate significantly, that could quickly cripple the stock. The seemingly cheap 9 times forward earnings that it trades at today could be due for an adjustment, as analysts will likely update their future earnings expectations for the stock.\n\nSuper Micro's stock is a gamble right now\n\nThere are so many unknowns surrounding Super Micro today that it can be next to impossible to predict how it might perform in 2025. If it releases its annual report and quarterly filings as planned, and its numbers still look great, then it could certainly take off. But if it doesn't, or if it releases the numbers but its growth rate or its bottom line don't look as good anymore, any one of those reasons could trigger a sell-off. Of course, if it fails to report its financials by the Nasdaq's latest deadline, that too could quickly send the stock spiraling.\n\nSuper Micro is one of the more volatile stocks on the market right now. Unless you have a high risk tolerance, you may want to just take a wait-and-see approach with it for now."

Israel has devastated Gaza after the October 2023 attack led by Hamas. Syria\u2019s civil war took a shocking turn with rebels ousting Bashar al-Assad. A brutal civil war has broken out in... Read More\n\nSyrian opposition fighters celebrate after the Syrian government collapsed in Damascus, Syria, on December 8, 2024. (AP Photo)\n\nThe Ukraine-Russia war that began in February 2022 led to a series of conflicts for various reasons in different parts of the world, including Israel, Gaza, Syria, Sudan and Myanmar, taking a huge toll on not only the stakeholders, but the world at large.\n\nWill 2025 continue to witness the rage or will be there an end to this violence? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nrelated stories\n\nWhat Is The Status Of The Gaza War?\n\nGaza Strip, which is small territory along the Mediterranean Sea, became the hotbed of violence in October 2023 when Palestinian extremist group Hamas unleashed attacks on Israel, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities in the area.\n\nAbout 1,200 people were killed, and more than 250 were taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. More than 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health ministry said.\n\nOn January 1, 2025, Israeli strikes killed at least 12 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, mostly women and children, officials said. Israel\u2019s military said it \u201celiminated\" Hamas fighters.\n\nDefense Minister Israel Katz has warned that Hamas will \u201csuffer blows of a magnitude not seen in Gaza for a long time\" if it doesn\u2019t release the remaining hostages and stop firing at Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military has stated quite often that it only targets militants and has blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army said it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nSome 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million have been displaced, many of them multiple times, due to the war.\n\nThe US and Arab mediators have spent nearly a year trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release, but those efforts have repeatedly stalled. Hamas has demanded a lasting truce, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until \u201ctotal victory.\"\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) in November issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu and former defence chief Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe war has impacted Israeli citizens. More than 82,000 Israelis moved abroad in 2024 and 33,000 people immigrated to the country, Israel\u2019s Central Bureau of Statistics said. Another 23,000 Israelis returned after long periods abroad.\n\nBut there is a chance that the war could end this year. Donald Trump had told Netanyahu that he wanted the conflict to end before he returns to the White House on January 20. After he was declared a winner, Trump had said in his address that he wants all wars to end.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly said Israel will keep hold of Gaza for the \u201cforeseeable future\" after the war ends. He also wants the Palestinian Authority to take a role in Gaza\u2019s administration.\n\nJosef Federman, Associated Press\u2019 news director (Israel-Palestinian territories-Jordan), said there are signs that the war is in its final stages. \u201cBut even if it ends, I don\u2019t see how anybody would want to invest into rebuilding Gaza again, given the history where every three or four years there is another war where all your work gets destroyed. So for them to get investment this time on that the scale that\u2019s needed, there are going to have to be some big changes in the way people think.\"\n\nIs Putin Ending The Ukraine Conflict?\n\nExperts predict that Russian President Vladimir Putin could up the ante against Ukraine as he would be set to reclaim the territories that were once part of the Soviet Union.\n\nProfessor Anthony Glees from the University of Buckingham told the Mirror that Putin is unlikely to be satisfied with a peace deal imposed by the West and aim for further expansion, targeting post-1997 NATO states.\n\n\u201cBy 2025, Putin will advance his strategic plan to undermine and force post-1997 NATO states, including Poland, Finland, and the Baltic nations, to leave the alliance,\" Glees warns. He told the Mirror that this \u201cbig grab\" could cause a global war.\n\nWith Trump promises his electorate to end the Ukraine war within a day by negotiating a peace deal, reports suggest his plan may embolden Putin rather than deter him. Trump proposed deal includes freezing the current front lines, establishing a buffer zone, and delaying Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership by 20 years.\n\nAs per Kyiv Independent, Putin had said Russia would agree to a ceasefire and peace talks only if Ukraine withdrew from Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia and disavowed its goal of joining the North-Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Putin has also demanded that Ukraine acknowledge Crimea and Sevastopol as Russian territory.\n\n\u201cAs soon as Kyiv declares readiness for such a decision and begins a real withdrawal of troops, as well as officially abandons its NATO ambitions, we will immediately cease fire and begin negotiations,\" Putin had said at the time.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, and since then, Moscow has made steady gains in eastern Ukraine. Russian troops have taken over 30 square kilometres of Kyiv\u2019s territory.\n\nUkraine had responded to Russia\u2019s offensive by using US long-range Army Tactical Missile System. Though experts insist that Kyiv being given permission to use these missiles is not a game changer, Moscow has responded by lowering its threshold for using nuclear weapons.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose term was due to end in May 2024 has been extended due to martial law. He would need to be re-elected for Russia to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, Putin had said.\n\nSamya Kullab, Associated Press correspondent in Ukraine, told the Guardian that the situation is far different from when the war began. \u201cThe jubilation and the joy from those initial moments has kind of turned into this incredible feeling of gloom and coming to terms with what we\u2019ve always known \u2014 that Ukraine is at a terrible disadvantage. I would describe it as being bled out slowly,\" Kullab wrote.\n\nEuropean Union leaders believe Ukraine needs to hold on and maybe placate Trump to open ideas for negotiations with Russia. The EU will have to continue to sanction individuals and companies in Russia.\n\nWho Is In Charge In Syria After The Government Collapse?\n\nIn Syria, protests began against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad, who came to power in 2000. Pro-democracy protesters during the peak of Arab Spring in 2011 took to the streets in Syria, calling for the ouster of the dictator. But the movement was crushed by Assad\u2019s forces, leading to the establishment of small militias and armed opposition groups from the Syrian military.\n\nAs anti-establishment forces grew, the Syrian allies stepped up support. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards and Lebanon\u2019s proxy Hezbollah helped the armed rebel groups, while Russia bolstered the Syrian Air Force with warplanes. Soon, al-Qaeda started taking interest in the cause of Syria\u2019s opposition forces. By 2014, extremists, including ISIS swept the country.\n\nThe US then created the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2013 comprising Kurdish fighters \u2013 to eliminate ISIS without confronting the Syrian regime. The SDF fought against the ISIS and ended their territorial existence in Syria. In 2020, Russia and Turkey agreed to a ceasefire in the opposition-held region of Idlib.\n\nIn 2024, the war was triggered by a coalition of rebel forces calling themselves the Military Operations Command. They swept through the villages outside Aleppo\u2014the second largest city in Syria \u2013 and eventually seized Damascus \u2013 the capital city.\n\nAssad has vowed that Syria will continue \u201cto defend its stability and territorial integrity in the face of all terrorists and their supporters\". The defence ministry said it was preparing to launch a counteroffensive. \u201cJoint Syrian-Russian warplanes\" have intensified precise strikes on rebel positions, killing and wounding dozens, it said in a statement.\n\nBut some experts have already expressed scepticism over Assad\u2019s chances. Aron Lund of the Century International think tank told CBS, \u201cAleppo seems to be lost for the regime. And a government without Aleppo is not really a functional government of Syria.\"\n\nThey cited the fact that Russia was heavily distracted by the war in Ukraine and that Iran and Hezbollah were left weakened by their conflict against Israel.\n\nThe experts said the rebels had been biding their time for years. \u201cThis has to do with geopolitics and local opportunity,\" Emile Hokayem, senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies told The Washington Post. \u201cThe rebellion at large had regrouped, rearmed and retrained for something like this.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden had called the fall of Assad a \u201cfundamental act of justice\" but also a \u201cmoment of risk and uncertainty,\" and said rebel groups are \u201csaying the right things now\" but the US would assess their actions.\n\nExperts predict that West Asia could see massive changes in 2025. A US official told CNN that developments in Syria mark the collapse of \u201cIran\u2019s artifice\" across the region.\n\nWhatever happens in Syria will have a major impact on its neighbours Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Israel. \u201cIn a matter of weeks, Iran lost its pillars in the Axis of Resistance. After the heavy blow that Hezbollah suffered at the hands of Israel, the fall of Assad is a fatal strike on Iran\u2019s influence efforts in the Middle East,\" Danny Citrinowicz, a non-resident fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Middle East Programs, told Council for Foreign Relations (CFR).\n\nWhat\u2019s The Status Of Civil War In Sudan?\n\nThe Sudanese civil war between two military factions, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began in September 2024. It started as a power rivalry between the military heads of the SAF and the RSF, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Hamdan Dagalo respectively. What began as a conflict in the capital city of Khartoum has spread to Omdurman, Bahri, Port Sudan, El Fasher and the Port Sudan cities, as well as the Darfur and Kordofan states.\n\nThe war is taking place as both warring parties are adamant about gaining ground and legitimising their power. The SAF, which came to power through a coup in 2021, claims to be the legitimate government, with the UN just about recognising them. However, the RSF has territorial gains around the capital and other war zones. It opposes the SAF\u2019s efforts to represent Sudan internationally, claiming legitimacy. The RSF, a former Arab militia known as Janjaweed, seeks alliances from several Arab countries to support its claim to power.\n\nSudan has been under the UN arms embargo, since the 2004 Darfur crisis, which has been now been extended for another year. However, the embargo has not blocked the flow of weapons. A Human Rights Watch report in July claimed that the warring parties have been using armed drones, anti-tank guided missiles, truck-mounted multi-barrel rocket launchers, and mortar munitions produced by companies registered in China, Iran, Russia, Serbia, and the UAE.\n\nAround nine rounds of peace talks led by the US and Saudi Arabia have been held, but all failed in the initial stage. The latest round of US-led peace talks was held in Geneva, Switzerland, on August 14, 2024. But, neither of the warring parties attended.\n\nAny new administration ruling Sudan would be a challenge to the internationally recognised and army-led national government which was forced out of Khartoum last year and now operates on the Red Sea coast in Port Sudan. A group of civilian politicians and armed group leaders have agreed to set up a \u201cpeace government\", RSF members told Reuters.\n\nThey said it would be civilian-led, independent of the RSF and set up to replace the government in Port Sudan which they accused of prolonging the war.\n\nThe civil has impacted several regions, with more than 2 million people seeking shelter in neighbouring Chad, South Sudan and Ethiopia. The refugee camps are overflown and have raised concerns in Europe that many will attempt to reach the continent. In February, dozens of Sudanese drowned when a migrant boat capsized along the Tunisia-Italy route. A lack of law and order has triggered ethnic clashes along the South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea borders. More than 100 deaths were reported in ethnic violence in the Abiey region, a disputed land between Sudan and South Sudan, according to the UN.\n\nThere is a fear that the military rivals would divide Sudan, leading to a similar situation in Libya. Unlike Ukraine and Gaza, the Sudanese war has not gained international traction, but the repercussions have been the same \u2014 fatalities, fear and destroyed livelihood.\n\nWhere Does Myanmar Stand In 2025?\n\nThe ongoing civil war in Myanmar, since the military toppled the civilian government in 2021, has killed more than 50,000 people and displaced around 3 million.\n\nThe fighting between the junta and armed resistance groups in the first two years of the war led to a stalemate while 2024 saw the military on the back foot. With the active Ukraine and Middle East wars, violence in Myanmar conflict has been received global attention.\n\nIn February 2021, the Myanmar\u2019s military staged a coup to overthrow the civilian government\u2014on the same day the parliament is set to swear in the winners of the 2020 election, in which Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won by a landslide. As a result, international condemnation and pro-democracy protests swept across the country, with the junta responding with a brutal crackdown. Nearly 500 were killed in the first two months of the coup.\n\nIn May 2021, the National Unity Government (NUG), comprising ousted lawmakers, protesters and ethnic minorities, announced its armed wing \u2013 the People\u2019s Defence Force (PDF). But in August, Min Aung Hlaing named himself the Prime Minister, and announced a potential extension to the state of emergency.\n\nIn 2022, resistance forces become more united, with many PDF units and ethnic armies forming partnerships to launch joint attacks against junta troops.\n\nIn October 2023, the Three Brotherhood Alliance, a coalition of ethnic armies, launched \u2018Operation 1027\u2019, seizing control of key areas from the military, marking a key victory for the resistance and a turning point in the war.\n\nIn January 2024, China brokered ceasefire between junta and the Three Brotherhood Alliance. But the junta announced mandatory conscription for all men between 18 and 35 years old and all women between 18 and 27 in February. The embattled military proposed a peace agreement with the resistance in September, urging them to \u201csolve political problems politically,\" but it is widely snubbed by the NUG.\n\nRebels in December took control of the country\u2019s western border with Bangladesh after insurgents of the Arakan Army (AA) drove out the junta\u2019s Border Guard Police (PGP5) in northern Rakhine State. The 270 km border with Bangladesh is now governed by the rebels.\n\nThe AA will likely be the first insurgent group to take complete control of a state in Myanmar, as per BBC.\n\ntop videos View all Swipe Left For Next Video View all\n\nMyanmar\u2019s neighbours are tense. Thailand in December held talks to resolve the political crisis. The meeting was attended by foreign ministers and high-level representatives from Myanmar as well as Laos, China, India, Bangladesh and host Thailand. But experts think the approach is unlikely to fructify.\n\nDavid Scott Mathieson, an independent analyst working on conflict and human rights issues on Myanmar, told Deutsche Welle, \u201cUnless the Myanmar military is serious about peace, these talks will be extremely limited. You can\u2019t approach any diplomacy on Myanmar without a clear understanding that the military is the root cause of all the problems.\"\n\nFirst Published: January 02, 2025, 18:04 IST"

            "article_content": "Image source: Instagram\n\nNicholas Aujula's 2025 predictions\n\nAujula's psychic journey of past life insights\n\nAlso Read |\n\nThe New Year begins with a wave of questions and people asking for future predictions to navigate their future lives. A catastrophe around the world was predicted to take place in 2025, as according to Baba Vanga. On the other hand, Nicholas Aujula, 38 years old, is also known to have given very dire predictions that came true when he said COVID-19 will erupt in 2018, the hypnotherapist from London shared his visions for what might happen in 2025.Aujula confirmed to be a believer in reincarnation, based on which the experiences gathered for centuries direct his psychic development. He described death as transformation, not something that ends or marks the disappearance of the soul. The process of death allows the soul to go forward by taking on a new form. This lets him, Aujula added, experience things before it occurs and explain it to humankind.Aujula has forecast that the year 2025 will be one of worldwide turmoil. According to him, religious and nationalist violence will start the Third World War. In his opinion, political murders have become commonplace, evil, and violence prevail over the world, and compassion and peace are as rare as grains of sand. Such predictions present a very grim picture of a world mired in conflict and suffering.Apart from political instability, Aujula feels that science will make giant leaps, particularly in medical technology. He feels that organs will be grown in the laboratory and this will be a breakthrough in medical science. But this will be balanced with natural disasters, he says, where heavy rain will cause widespread flooding, displacing millions of people and destroying homes. He further warns that flooding of whole cities by rising sea levels will exacerbate the calamity even worse than the cause created by environmental change.According to Aujula, the political meltdown of the British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is an omen, while inflation keeps steadily on the increase across the entire globe. Meanwhile, amidst the pandemonium, he expects Prince William and Prince Harry will again reconcile once in a blue moon. In this regard, their estrangement will also soon be rewarded. All these prophesies hint at a mixture of political predictions with personal ones around the international scene.Nicholas Aujula claims that his psychic ability has its root in a profound experience he had as a teenager. He says at the age of 17, he had a dream in which he was shown things that were to happen by an unknown figure. He asserts this experience initiated him into psychic prediction. Aujula's prophecies have gained fame over the years, and several of his prophecies have already been seen to be correct, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, Donald Trump winning the presidency, and the COVID-19 pandemic.Aujula also claims that he was in a coma for some time after waking up from it, during which he started experiencing visions of his past lives. He believes these experiences have contributed to his ability to predict future events. He says that he has lived a previous life as an ancient queen of Egypt, a tailor in China, a nun in the Himalayas, and even as a lion in Africa. Such is his faith in reincarnation, the premise for his predictions: \"The soul never dies,\" he claims. \"It just comes back to be reborn in some form.\""

            "article_content": "Ever since Microsoft first introduced its Arm-based Copilot Plus laptops in June, I\u2019ve been wondering when we might see Copilot Plus features appear on desktop PCs. Six months on, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re about to see mini PCs that deliver the AI performance required for features like Recall, Click To Do, and AI-powered image generation and editing in Windows 11. These mini PCs might even help Microsoft compete with Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nAsus became the first PC manufacturer to announce a mini PC that\u2019s Copilot Plus capable in September. It then revealed the full specs of its upcoming NUC 14 Pro AI last month, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that kicks off next week. Asus\u2019 mini PC even has a Copilot button on the front and is almost identical to the size of Apple\u2019s latest Mac Mini.\n\nThe timing of Asus\u2019 spec drop came on the same day that Taiwanese company Geekom revealed three new mini PCs that it will showcase at CES. Geekom is releasing a mini PC with AMD\u2019s Strix Point CPUs inside and one with Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processor, meaning both will be Copilot Plus compatible. The third model is powered by Intel\u2019s unannounced Arrow Lake-H laptop processors, which are unlikely to have an NPU sufficient enough to be Copilot Plus compatible.\n\nI\u2019m going to be paying close attention to CES next week to see if there are any other Windows OEMs that are ready to launch Copilot Plus mini PCs. CES is usually a launch point for Microsoft\u2019s latest laptop or tablet initiatives, and last year the company convinced OEMs to put a Copilot key on their laptop keyboards. Asus wouldn\u2019t be adding a Copilot button on the front of its own mini PC without Microsoft\u2019s involvement, so I wonder how many other PC makers Microsoft has been working with to add dedicated Copilot buttons.\n\nGeekom\u2019s mention of Qualcomm chips inside its mini PC means we\u2019ll start to see Qualcomm\u2019s latest chips venture beyond laptops for the first time. Qualcomm was supposed to ship its mini PC Snapdragon Dev Kit in June alongside Copilot Plus laptops, but it ended up canceling it months later after issues with manufacturing the device. Qualcomm has also teased that its Snapdragon X Elite chips could appear in mini PCs or even all-in-one PCs, so perhaps we\u2019ll see some Copilot Plus all-in-one PCs next week, too.\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to see when we might get Copilot Plus features on traditional powerful desktop PCs. Intel\u2019s latest Core Ultra desktop CPU arrived in October with an NPU inside, but it wasn\u2019t capable enough to hit the 40 TOPS requirement that Microsoft mandates for Copilot Plus features. We\u2019re going to have to wait until next-gen desktop CPUs from Intel and AMD arrive to see if more capable NPUs are a priority for chipmakers. Until then, mini PCs and all-in-one PCs that use laptop processors are going to be the only way to get Copilot Plus features in a desktop PC form factor.\n\nWhile Copilot Plus features remain limited to Windows PCs, that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t see the main Copilot assistant appear on more devices. I\u2019ve heard from multiple sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans that the company is keen to get Copilot on devices beyond just PCs, phones, and tablets.\n\nWe might well see Copilot appear on some unexpected hardware at CES next week, just as Microsoft has also been hinting about its ambitions for dedicated AI hardware in recent months. Windows chief Pavan Davuluri admitted in an October Notepad interview that the power of modern AI models \u201cwill free up the ability to innovate in hardware and come out with purpose-built hardware.\u201d\n\nDavuluri stopped short of detailing what dedicated AI hardware would look like for Microsoft, but weeks later Yusuf Mehdi, executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer at Microsoft, dropped some additional hints in an underreported interview with YouTuber Austin Evans.\n\n\u201cThese devices that see the world, that you wear on your body, on your person, I think that those combined with AI will be very valuable,\u201d said Mehdi in late October. \u201cIt can do image recognition, it can talk to you about what\u2019s going on. I think that\u2019s a fascinating place that we\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview Mehdi also describes wearable health-related devices as exciting and \u201ca big opportunity\u201d for the future. Microsoft then confirmed last month that Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has hired multiple former colleagues to help run a new AI health unit. It\u2019s hard to imagine Microsoft venturing into fitness wearables again after the Microsoft Band was scrapped in 2016, but I could definitely see the company wanting to partner with device manufacturers and offer up AI-powered health services for these types of devices.\n\nEither way, 2025 won\u2019t see Microsoft slow down with its ambition to get Copilot on all the screens we look at every day.\n\nThe pad:\n\nThanks for subscribing and reading to the very end. I\u2019ll be reflecting on Microsoft\u2019s 50-year history in Notepad later this year, so if there\u2019s a particular period of time you\u2019re interested in hearing more about,please get in touch: notepad@theverge.com."

            "article_content": "Listen to the article 5 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The following is a guest post from Ang Troy, senior director analyst at Gartner.\n\nMost IT organizations have cloud services in place or have made conscious decisions regarding its adoption. Such decisions may include adopting the cloud quickly and wholly, to proceed methodically with cloud services or to delay for a period of time.\n\nIn any of these strategies, IT organizations face major obstacles building, deploying, consuming, managing, securing and integrating cloud services.\n\nThe adoption of cloud computing is multidimensional, and it must be run like a multiyear program, not a fixed-duration project. As a result, the complexity of cloud adoption requires at least one accountable architectural leader to guide the organization through the transformation. This is the task of a role that many IT organizations are now finding to be mandatory: the enterprise cloud architect.\n\nMany organizations can clearly point to their lead enterprise cloud architect, but others have yet to formally name this individual or have piled the cloud responsibilities onto an already overburdened enterprise architect. Organizations that are the most successful have formally assigned cloud architecture responsibilities to ensure that a single, accountable architect is in charge.\n\nWhat is an enterprise cloud architect?\n\nAn enterprise cloud architect is responsible for the cloud computing initiatives in an organization and for directing the architectural aspects of the cloud team across all aspects of IT and the business.\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect should be the foundation of a cloud center of excellence, or what will become the CCOE \u2014 the enterprise architecture function that governs the organization\u2019s approach to the cloud.\n\nCommon alternative names for a CCOE include: the cloud business office, the cloud transformation office, the cloud brokerage team and the cloud enablement team.\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect is usually a senior individual contributor who serves as the leader of the CCOE \u2014 or, if there is no cloud EA function, then as the leader of cloud initiatives.\n\nOften, the role of the enterprise cloud architect is largely self-directed, and day-to-day responsibilities are usually fluid. The specific tasks vary, depending on the level of the organization\u2019s cloud maturity and the maturity of its CCOE.\n\nEnterprise cloud architects are typically not \u201chands-on.\u201d They will make decisions, but hand off responsibility for their technical implementation to a cloud engineering function. Cloud technical architects may be hands-on, but they are associated with the cloud engineering function, not the CCOE.\n\nWhere cloud sits in the organization\n\nThe lead enterprise cloud architect is the foundation of the CCOE, and may be the only member of this hub in some organizations.\n\nCompanies may not have a structured center of excellence in name, and may rely on the enterprise cloud architect to effectively assume the role of this center. This is a common and acceptable practice, though Gartner recommends building out the CCOE with additional members.\n\nRegardless of the organizational design, the enterprise cloud architect has six key relationships:\n\nAdvisory-level access to senior IT leaders, either directly or through the EA team Direct and collaborative access to senior EA teams Direct and collaborative access to domain architecture teams Collaborative access to technical architects and teams Collaborative access to central function architects and teams Collaborative access to business unit representatives to discern business needs for specific solutions\n\nSkill sets of enterprise cloud architects\n\nDue to the broad applicability of cloud computing in an organization, it\u2019s unlikely that any individual will possess all the skills that the enterprise cloud architect role demands. However, the enterprise cloud architect should possess as many of the desired skills as possible.\n\nWhere a specific skill is lacking, the enterprise cloud architect should be able to collaborate or engage the relevant, resident experts in the organization. For example, if the enterprise cloud architect does not have a skill or strength in IT service management (ITSM), that individual needs to build a strong relationship with an ITSM expert to drive objectives to completion.\n\nAt the core, enterprise cloud architects are enterprise architects. Therefore, they need to have the competencies of good enterprise architects in order to drive business outcomes, empower business partners and develop and build effective architecture disciplines\n\nCloud computing is not a matter of \u201cif\u201d; it\u2019s a matter of \u201chow.\u201d Adopting cloud services is similar to a complex IT program that has no clear end in sight. Guiding cloud adoption requires strong leadership, not just at an executive level, but also at an architectural level.\n\nEnterprise cloud architects are paramount to the eventual success of cloud adoption. Organizations should not delay placing the right individual into this crucial IT role."

Her discovery this week puts an end to one of Great Britain\u2019s oldest missing person cases.\n\nFox, now 68, disappeared from Coventry in 1972. On Sunday, West Midlands police released a grainy photo of her from around the time she vanished to the public asking for help one more time. The police stated in their plea that Fox had been living with her parents when she disappeared and could have been in a relationship with a man at the time. They also suggested that she may have moved out of the area.\n\n\u201cWe searched through every piece of evidence we could find and managed to locate a photo of Sheila,\u201d said Detective Sergeant Jenna Shaw, a member of the West Midlands police cold case investigation team.\n\nJust a few hours later, the 52-year-old mystery had finally been solved.

The footage shows multiple human-like figures seemingly standing atop a sea of clouds, prompting various conspiracy theories ranging from alien lifeforms to shapeshifters.\n\nThe video was first shared by Myra Moore, a self-proclaimed paranormal expert, who posted it on her social media account with a call for others to weigh in on what could be behind the strange scene. In her post, Moore expressed her fascination with the unusual footage, saying, \u201cThe following footage was captured by a passenger on a commercial airline. They were glancing outside when they noticed something weird, what appeared to be beans standing on top of the clouds and it\u2019s more than one, but what is it?

That\u2019s why the Cowboy State is one of the best places to see and possibly explain the unexplainable.\n\nThe National UFO Center keeps records of every sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) reported in the United States since 1995.\n\nThe website Stacker used that data to compile a list of the top 10 with the most reports of strange, inexplainable sights in the night sky.\n\nThe world of UFO and UAP sightings has gotten more serious in the last several years, and more people are looking up and looking for answers.\n\n\u201cI can tell you is that quite a few sightings in Wyoming remain unexplained,\u201d said Richard Beckwith, Rock Springs city attorney and part-time UFO investigator.\n\nHe\u2019s spent decades investigating UFO sightings in Wyoming, but had his first personal experience with one spotted near Green River earlier in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon is real,\u201d he said. \u201cEven the Pentagon has admitted UFOs and UAFs are real, and they can\u2019t explain them. It was treated as a joke for most of the time I\u2019ve been doing it, and now it\u2019s become real.\u201d\n\nThe List\n\nOverall, the National UFO Center has 421 reports of UFOs and UAFs in Wyoming. Cheyenne tops the list of Wyoming places with the most sightings, reporting 50 aerial phenomena since 1995.\n\nSeeing Cheyenne at the top doesn\u2019t surprise Beckwith at all. One would expect more sightings in Wyoming\u2019s most populated city, but Cheyenne is also home to a critical U.S. Air Force base.\n\n\u201cWyoming\u2019s UFO sightings, from my perspective, primarily appear over the Warren Air Force Base and the nearby missile silos,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been quite a few sightings, going back to the 1950s.\u201d\n\nCasper is second with 37 UFO sightings, followed by Laramie with 29, Rock Springs with 17 and Gillette with 15. Cody, Sheridan, Riverton and Evanston round out the bottom half of the list.\n\nYellowstone National Park sits at the bottom with eight UFO sightings. Sasquatch isn\u2019t the only elusive and mysterious thing hanging around the pristine wilderness of northwest Wyoming.\n\nThe state that\u2019s seen and reported the most UFOs is California, with more than 16,500 sightings. The Pentagon attributes most of these sightings to balloons, drones, aircraft and other terrestrial sources.\n\nOne thing Wyomingites won\u2019t want to do is try to shoot down any UFOs they spot. If that UFO happens to be a neighbor\u2019s drone, that would violate federal law and could come with a fine and a jail sentence .\n\nNot Explaining The Unexplainable\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that the number of sightings corresponds with Wyoming\u2019s most populated areas. Beckwith said that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been, but that doesn\u2019t make these phenomena any easier to explain.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, we had the simple explanation that these were aliens from another planet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the longer I\u2019ve done this, the explanations have become more elusive. It\u2019s much more complex than that.\u201d\n\nModern-day theories for UFOs and UAP include black technology programs, foreign espionage and astronomical events in addition to the extraterrestrial. If there are any probable explanations for what\u2019s been seen over Wyoming and elsewhere, the federal government has declined to comment or elaborate.\n\n\u201cThey continue to say emphatically that we have no evidence that these objects are extraterrestrial in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cThat begs the question \u2014 if they can\u2019t explain it, how can they determine that these objects are also simultaneously not manufactured elsewhere? It's almost like, \u2018Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.\u2019\u201d\n\nRecently, there have been three congressional hearings on UFOs and UAFs, and Beckwith said he\u2019s spoken with two members of U.S. Congress about the phenomenon. Wyoming scientists are skeptical of their findings, but Beckwith described it as one of the rare bipartisan issues that has reached Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPeople who looked at this phenomenon were ridiculed about this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s changed since 2017, now that the government has admitted they\u2019re real.\u201d\n\nWyoming Watchers\n\nBeckwith is one of four Wyoming field investigators for the Mutual UFO Network, an organization of civilian volunteers that follow up on and report UFO and UAF sightings. The number of investigators shows Beckwith how much interest has grown for these unexplainable phenomena in the last decade.\n\n\u201cI have investigators in Cheyenne, Riverton, and two in Rock Springs that investigate sightings all over the state,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil a couple of years ago, I was the only one.\u201d\n\nBeckwith described his first experience with a UFO back in March. He used his Sony SR4 camera to capture a video of \u201canomalous nocturnal lights\u201d hovering near Green River.\n\n\u201cI got the radar records from that night, but haven\u2019t been able to correlate what I saw with any particular targets on the radar,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly didn't have a transponder. So, to that extent, I can't explain it. But I saw and filmed it.\u201d\n\nBeckwith hopes more Wyomingites will report any UFO or UAF sightings to the National UFO Center or the Mutual UFO Network. Regardless of what people believe they've seen in the sky, he and many others want answers.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of space and open sky in Wyoming. Beckwith believes the Cowboy State could be the key to getting better data and information to shine more light into the darkness surrounding UFOs and UAFs.\n\n\u201cWyoming is the ninth-largest state in land area, and we have the lowest population,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, we have sightings with several witnesses in different locations. They\u2019re rarer than other places, but they still occur.\u201d\n\nAndrew Rossi can be reached at arossi@cowboystatedaily.com."

            "article_content": "With global interest in UFOs at an all-time high, particularly in the United States where mysterious drone sightings have been driving everyone crazy, two Israeli researchers have uncovered fascinating patterns in who reports these mysterious sightings \u2014 and when.\n\nTheir study, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, reveals that UFO reports might tell us less about what\u2019s in the sky and more about what\u2019s happening on the ground, particularly in our bank accounts.\n\nOhad Raveh from Hebrew University and Nathan Goldstein from Bar-Ilan University were trying to solve an interesting puzzle: How can we measure what the public is paying attention to in different places and at different times? This is important for understanding the economy, but it\u2019s difficult to measure.\n\nThey looked at years of data cataloguing recorded sightings of UFOs \u2014 or as they refer to them, UAPs (unidentified aerial phenomena).\n\nTheir assumption was that when people report seeing something strange in the sky, they\u2019re clearly paying attention to their surroundings. The researchers thought this could be a useful way to measure public attention.\n\n\u201c We set out to understand what the association is between attention given to the sky and attention given to the economy,\u201d explains Raveh.\n\nTwo contradictory findings?\n\nThe researchers analyzed thousands of reports from the National UFO Reporting Center in the United States and discovered that more wealthy areas consistently report more UFO sightings than less wealthy regions.\n\nRaveh and Goldstein initially believed that this phenomenon could be explained by understanding attention as a hierarchical system: you give attention to the most pressing issues before you worry about other things.\n\n\u201cOnce you give attention to the fundamental things, then you may give attention to things that are more luxurious,\u201d Raveh elaborates. \u201cAttention to the economy is a fundamental thing, because in the end that\u2019s what brings food to your table. But once you attend to that, then you have more time on your hands to start looking at the sky.\u201d\n\nSo, because people who are more financially secure can let their minds (and eyes) wander from their budgets, they\u2019re more likely to see UAPs, right?\n\nHowever, that theory runs into some turbulence when considering the second pattern they uncovered during their research: Across the board, both poor and wealthy areas saw an increase in UFO sightings during economic downturns \u2013 a pattern that caught the researchers by surprise.\n\n\u201c We thought that the two types of attention would be substitutable. Because attention is a limited resource, and if you give attention to, say, the sky, that would be at the expense of other types of attention that you can give to other factors like the economy,\u201d says Raveh. \u201cBut apparently it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d\n\nTo summarize: Wealthy areas generally report more UFOs than poor areas, but when any area hits hard economic times, UFO reports increase.\n\nTurns out rich people get to spend more time looking for aliens. Photo by Jonas Von Werne via Pexels\n\nIt\u2019s all about attention\n\nThis apparent contradiction makes sense when you realize UFO reports are really measuring how much attention people are paying to their surroundings.\n\nWealthy people generally have more free time and mental space to notice unusual things in the sky. But during economic downturns, people everywhere have more time on their hands (often due to job losses or reduced work hours) and thus spot more UFOs.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by what the researchers saw during Covid lockdowns: When people were forcibly given more free time (even if they weren\u2019t necessarily experiencing economic hardship), UFO sightings increased.\n\nOverall, the research findings serve as strong evidence that UFO/UAP sightings serve as a reliable indicator of public attention patterns, which opens new possibilities for understanding how public attention influences economic outcomes.\n\nOnly one question remains, though \u2014 have the researchers seen any UFOs themselves?\n\n\u201c I wish!\u201d jokes Raveh. \u201cActually, since we started to work, I\u2019ve tried to give more attention to the skies. But I haven\u2019t seen anything, unfortunately. I hope they visit Israel sometime.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

Ajith, astrophysicist with the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Bengaluru, has said.\n\nHe was at the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium (RSCP) in Kozhikode on Thursday (January 2) to deliver a lecture demonstration on \u2018Universe: yesterday, today and tomorrow\u2019. It is the first in the \u2018Cosmic Snapshots\u2019 series of lectures being organised by the RSCP.\n\nMr. Ajith pointed out that the concept of a primordial atom, proposed in the early 20th century by Georges Lemaitre, who is considered the father of the Big Bang theory, was just a \u201cstory\u201d and not a scientific fact. According to Lemaitre, the universe began with an explosion from a single particle at a specific moment in time. \u201cThe primordial atom is just a way of explaining what might have happened. At some point, the universe shrank into one tiny entity. To understand what happened then, we need to combine Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity with quantum physics,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ajith traced the history of our understanding of the universe, starting with Nicolaus Copernicus, who first suggested a sun-centered universe, and Galileo Galilei, who proved it through observations. \u201cGalileo\u2019s discoveries changed how we saw the universe and sparked the age of enlightenment and the Renaissance, leading to modern science and technology,\u201d he said. German astronomer Kepler improved Copernicus\u2019 ideas, discovering that planets move in elliptical orbits. Isaac Newton later proposed that the same force making an apple fall also keeps planets revolving around the Sun.\n\nMr. Ajith highlighted that Newton\u2019s laws of motion are still used today, especially in rocket science. He explained how the sun-centered universe concept evolved, revealing the Sun as just a small part of the Milky Way. Later, astronomers debated whether Earth was part of a single galaxy or many. Edward Hubble then developed a telescope to measure the distance to distant galaxies. Mr. Ajith also mentioned Einstein\u2019s theory, which described gravity not as a force, but as the effect of space-time, a concept he introduced to explain how gravity impacts space and the flow of time."

            "article_content": "Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity has revolutionized our understanding of gravity and the universe. However, it leaves some unanswered questions, particularly about singularities and black holes.\n\nRecent studies suggest quantum mechanics could help resolve these mysteries and offer new insights into the fundamental nature of space-time and black holes.\n\nGeneral relativity\n\nGeneral relativity is a theory developed by Albert Einstein to explain how gravity works.\n\nInstead of thinking of gravity as a force that pulls objects toward each other, like Isaac Newton suggested, Einstein proposed that gravity is the result of massive objects bending the space and time around them.\n\nImagine space and time as a stretchy fabric, and when something heavy, like the Earth or the Sun, sits on it, the fabric bends around it.\n\nThis bending is what we experience as gravity. So, objects like planets and moons move in curved paths because they are following the curves in this \u201cfabric\u201d created by mass.\n\nOne of the most mind-blowing predictions of general relativity is that time isn\u2019t the same everywhere.\n\nTime actually moves slower near a strong gravitational field, like near a planet or a star, and faster in areas with weaker gravity.\n\nThis effect is known as time dilation. It\u2019s something that satellites in space have to account for because they experience time a little differently than we do on Earth.\n\nUnderstanding singularities \u2013 the basics\n\nThe elegant framework of general relativity encounters a critical limitation at singularities \u2013 points in space-time where matter collapses to infinite density, and the curvature of space-time becomes infinitely sharp.\n\nThese singularities arise under extreme gravitational collapse, as shown by Nobel laureate Roger Penrose. When a massive star exhausts its fuel and collapses under its gravity, the result can be a singularity.\n\nAt a singularity, the fundamental laws of physics, as we know them, no longer work. Concepts like time, space, and the behavior of matter lose their meaning, rendering physical predictions impossible.\n\nThis unpredictability would challenge science\u2019s foundation, which relies on consistent, testable laws to explain the universe.\n\nUnderstanding and addressing singularities is, therefore, a major challenge in modern physics.\n\nResearchers aim to find ways to reconcile this breakdown, often looking to quantum mechanics or other advanced theories to fill the gaps left by general relativity.\n\nBlack holes and cosmic censorship\n\nBlack holes, nature\u2019s enigmatic phenomena, may conceal singularities. Their defining feature, the event horizon, prevents anything, including light, from escaping.\n\nAccording to Penrose\u2019s cosmic censorship conjecture, singularities resulting from gravitational collapse remain hidden behind these event horizons, preserving the predictability of physics elsewhere in the universe.\n\nDespite its elegance, cosmic censorship remains unproven. Scientists have found no definitive counterexamples, making it one of the most significant open problems in mathematical physics.\n\nQuantum mechanics and black holes\n\nWhile general relativity focuses on large-scale structures, quantum mechanics governs particles and atoms.\n\nCombining these frameworks to understand black holes has proven complex. Recent research published in the journal Physical Review Letters suggests that Penrose\u2019s conjecture is supported by quantum mechanics.\n\nPhysicists have long speculated about \u201cquantum black holes,\u201d where quantum effects play a significant role. These black holes raise questions about how cosmic censorship applies in the quantum realm.\n\nA potential answer lies in developing a theory of \u201cquantum gravity,\u201d which integrates quantum mechanics with space-time. However, such a theory remains elusive.\n\nAdvances in quantum cosmic censorship\n\nQuantum mechanics introduces new complexities such as negative energy, a phenomenon allowed in quantum mechanics but absent in classical physics.\n\nPenrose\u2019s theorem assumes that all matter has positive energy, so the existence of negative energy introduces scenarios that the theorem does not address.\n\nTo explore these complexities, researchers use a hybrid approach called semi-classical gravity. In this model, the space-time structure still obeys Einstein\u2019s general relativity, but the matter within it is treated according to quantum mechanics.\n\nThis allows scientists to study how quantum effects influence the behavior of space-time and black holes.\n\nFrom this perspective, quantum mechanics might play a role in keeping singularities hidden. The concept, called quantum cosmic censorship, proposes that quantum effects could reinforce the \u201cclothing\u201d of singularities by black hole event horizons.\n\nThis means that quantum mechanics may prevent singularities from becoming observable, thus modifying their behavior and preserving the predictability of the universe.\n\nThe idea builds on Penrose\u2019s original cosmic censorship conjecture but extends it into the quantum realm, offering a potential bridge between classical and quantum physics.\n\nThe energy of space-time\n\nA key to understanding quantum cosmic censorship lies in the Penrose inequality. This mathematical relationship links the mass of space-time to the area of black hole horizons, assuming cosmic censorship holds. In quantum systems, a similar inequality could provide insights.\n\nIn 2019, researchers proposed a quantum Penrose inequality. Building on this, the new study introduced a refined version that applies even in strong quantum effects.\n\nThe research shows that the energy of space-time relates to the combined entropy of black holes and quantum matter, which thus maintains the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nStrengthening theories with quantum mechanics\n\nThe new quantum Penrose inequality strengthens the idea of cosmic censorship. While not a definitive proof, it shows that quantum mechanics reinforces the principles governing black holes and singularities.\n\nThis advance bridges classical and quantum physics, and paves the way for deeper insights into the universe.\n\nAs space-time might end at singularities, quantum mechanics ensures we remain shielded from such extremes, preserving the predictability of our universe.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\n\u2014\u2013\n\nLike what you read?
