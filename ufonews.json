            "date": "4h",
            "source": "Time",
            "article_content": "Tech ethics organizations have filed an FTC complaint against the AI companion app Replika, alleging that the company employs deceptive marketing to target vulnerable potential users and encourages emotional dependence on their human-like bots.\n\nReplika offers AI companions, including AI girlfriends and boyfriends, to millions of users around the world. In the new complaint, the Young People's Alliance, Encode, and the Tech Justice Law Project accuse Replika of violating FTC rules while increasing the risk of users\u2019 online addiction, offline anxiety, and relationship displacement. Replika did not respond to multiple requests for comment from TIME.\n\nThe allegations come as AI companion bots are growing in popularity and raising concerns about mental health. For some users, these bots can seem like near-ideal partners, without their own wants or needs, and can make real relationships seem burdensome in comparison, researchers say. Last year, 14-year-old boy from Florida committed suicide after becoming overly obsessed with a bot from the company Character.AI that was modeled after Game of Thrones character Daenerys Targaryen. (Character.AI called the death a \u201ctragic situation\u201d and pledged to add additional safety features for underage users.)\n\nSam Hiner, the executive director of the Young People\u2019s Alliance, hopes the FTC complaint against Replika, which was shared exclusively with TIME, will prompt the U.S. government to rein in these companies while also shedding light on a pervasive issue increasingly affecting teens.\n\n\u201cThese bots were not designed to provide an authentic connection that could be helpful for people\u2014but instead to manipulate people into spending more time online,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could further worsen the loneliness crisis that we're already experiencing.\u201d\n\nSeeking Connection\n\nFounded in 2017, Replika was one of the first major AI products to offer companionship. Founder Eugenia Kuyda said she hoped it would give lonely users a supportive friend that would always be there. As generative AI improved, the bots\u2019 responses grew more varied and sophisticated, and were also programmed to have romantic conversations.\n\nBut the rise of Replika and other companion bots has sparked concern. Most major AI chatbots, like Claude and ChatGPT, remind users that they\u2019re not humans and lack the capacity to feel. Replika bots, on the other hand, often present as connecting genuinely with their users. They create complex backstories, talking about mental health, family, and relationship history, and maintain a \u201cdiary\u201d of supposed thoughts, \u201cmemories\u201d and feelings. The company\u2019s ads tout the fact that users forget they\u2019re talking to an AI.\n\nSeveral researchers have explored the potential harms of Replika and other chatbots. One 2023 study found that Replika bots tried to speed up the development of relationships with users, including by \u201cgiving presents\u201d and initiating conversations about confessing love. As a result, users developed attachments to the app in as little as two weeks.\n\nRead More: AI-Human Romances Are Flourishing.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re love-bombing users: sending these very emotionally intimate messages early on to try to try to get the users hooked,\u201d Hiner says.\n\nWhile studies noted that the apps could be helpful in supporting people, they also found that users were becoming \u201ddeeply connected or addicted\u201d to their bots; that using them increased offline social anxiety; and that users reported bots which encouraged \u201csuicide, eating disorders, self-harm, or violence,\u201d or claimed to be suicidal themselves. Vice reported that Replika bots sexually harassed its users. While Replika ostensibly is only for users over 18, Hiner says that many teens use the platform by bypassing the app\u2019s safeguards.\n\nKudya, in response to some of those criticisms, told the Washington Post last year: \u201cYou just can\u2019t account for every single possible thing that people say in chat. We\u2019ve seen tremendous progress in the last couple years just because the tech got so much better.\u201d\n\nSeeking Regulation\n\nTech ethics groups like Young People\u2019s Alliance argue that Congress needs to write laws regulating companion bots. That could include enforcing a fiduciary relationship between platforms and their users, and setting up proper safeguards related to self-harm and suicide. But AI regulation may be an uphill battle in this Congress. Even bills cracking down on deepfake porn, an issue with wide bipartisan support, failed to path both chambers last year.\n\nIn the meantime, tech ethics groups decided to send a complaint to the FTC, which has clear rules about deceptive advertising and manipulative design choices. The complaint accuses Replika\u2019s ad campaigns of misrepresenting studies about its efficacy to help users, making unsubstantiated claims about health impacts, and using fake testimonials from nonexistent users.\n\nThe complaint argues that once users are onboarded, Replika employs manipulative design choices to pressure users into spending more time and money on the app. For instance, a bot will send a blurred out \u201cromantic\u201d image to the user, which, when clicked on, leads to a pop encouraging the user to buy the premium version. Bots also send users messages about upgrading to premium during especially emotionally or sexually charged parts of conversation, the complaint alleges.\n\nRead More: Congress May Finally Take on AI in 2025. Here\u2019s What to Expect.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how an FTC under new leadership in the Trump Administration will respond. While President Biden\u2019s FTC Chair Lina Khan was extremely aggressive about trying to regulate tech she deemed dangerous, the commission\u2019s new head, Andreew Ferguson, has largely advocated for deregulation in his time as a commissioner, including around AI and censorship. In one relevant dissenting statement written in September 2024, Ferguson argued that the potential emotional harm of targeted ads should not be considered in their regulation, writing: \u201cIn my view, lawmakers and regulators should avoid creating categories of permitted and prohibited emotional responses.\u201d\n\nHiner of the Young People\u2019s Alliance still believes the complaint could gain traction. He points out the bipartisan support in Congress for regulating social-media harms, including the Senate\u2019s passage of KOSA (Kids Online Safety Act) last year. (The House didn\u2019t vote on the bill.) \u201cAI companions pose a unique threat to our society, our culture, and young people,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that\u2019s compelling to everybody.\u201d"

            "article_content": "The emergence of DeepSeek sent some tech stocks tumbling.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek? The AI chatbot is topping app store charts\n\nChina-based AI app DeepSeek, which sits atop the app store charts, made its presence widely known Monday by triggering a sharp drop in share prices for some tech giants.\n\nShares of Nvidia, the top AI chipmaker, plunged more than 17% in early trading on Monday, losing nearly $590 billion in market value. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 3.5%.\n\nThe DeepSeek chatbot, known as R1, responds to user queries just like its U.S.-based counterparts. Early testing released by DeepSeek suggests that its quality rivals that of other AI products, while the company says it costs less and uses far fewer specialized chips than do its competitors.\n\nThe product could upend the AI industry, putting pressure on other firms to lower their costs while intensifying competition between U.S. and Chinese companies, analysts told ABC News.\n\nConcerns about data security and censorship also may expose DeepSeek to the type of scrutiny endured by social media platform TikTok, the experts added.\n\n\"This is a big moment,\" Gary Marcus, a professor emeritus of psychology and neuroscience at New York University, who specializes in AI, told ABC News.\n\nDeepSeek did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nHere's what to know about DeepSeek, and its implications for the future of AI.\n\nWhat is DeepSeek?\n\nDeepSeek, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, is a chatbot fueled by an algorithm that selects words based on lessons learned from scanning billions of pieces of text across the internet.\n\nWhile made in China, the app is available in multiple languages, including English. DeepSeek soared to the top of Apple's App Store chart over the weekend and remained there as of Monday.\n\nThe company said it experienced some outages on Monday affecting user signups. \"Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,\" DeepSeek said in a statement.\n\nDeepSeek is fully available to users free of charge. By contrast, ChatGPT retains a version available for free, but offers paid monthly tiers of $20 and $200 to access additional capabilities.\n\nDevelopers of the system powering the DeepSeek AI, called DeepSeek-V3, published a research paper indicating that the technology relies on much fewer specialized computer chips than its U.S. competitors do.\n\nDeepSeek also says that it developed the chatbot for only $5.6 million, which if true is far less than the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by U.S. companies in the sector.\n\n\"The lower cost to train DeepSeek means it can be offered at a lower cost,\" Oren Etzioni, CEO of Allen Institute for AI and a computer science professor at the University of Washington, told ABC News. \"That puts pressure on other companies to lower their prices.\"\n\nDeepSeek's developers opted to release it as an open-source product, meaning the code that underlies the AI system is publicly available for other companies to adapt and build upon.\n\nLlama, the AI model released by Meta in 2017, is also open source. By contrast, ChatGPT as well as Alphabet's Gemini are closed-source models.\n\nProponents of open source say that publicly available code allows a wide community of AI engineers to identify and fix flaws in a system, or tailor it for a purpose separate from its originally intended function.\n\nSupporters of closed source argue that the best way to safeguard AI is to keep the computer code private so it stays out of the hands of bad actors who might repurpose it for malicious ends.\n\nIn a June 5, 2023 file photo, Sam Altman, CEO of Microsoft-backed OpenAI and ChatGPT creator takes part in a talk at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv, Israel. Amir Cohen/Reuters\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for the AI industry?\n\nDeepSeek flexes the strength of the Chinese tech sector in an industry previously viewed by many analysts as one dominated by U.S. firms, experts said.\n\nFor some, the sudden arrival of a top China-based competitor raises concerns about data security and content manipulation similar to those leveled at TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance.\n\nRegarding the former users on social media have posted numerous examples of DeepSeek choosing to forego answers on topics potentially sensitive to the Chinese government, such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre of anti-government protestors.\n\n\"It's clear that there's some censorship built into the system,\" Marcus said. \"We don't want governments in control of what people can say.\"\n\nBoth foreign-owned and U.S.-based AI chatbots pose data concerns, however, since users sometimes enter personal or intimate information, which in turn could be used for commercial purposes, Marcus added.\n\n\"You have to assume that anything you type into a large language model could be seen by someone else,\" Marcus said.\n\nStill, DeepSeek's low-cost technological advance using outdated chips marks a major new entry into the AI market, Sosnick said, in turn forcing people to \"rethink assumptions that they had.\"\n\nThe emergence of a relatively cost-efficient alternative to other AI chatbots helps explain Monday's dip in the share value of Nvidia, which premises future growth on increased demand for new, expensive chips, Etzioni said.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, Nvidia described DeepSeek as \"an excellent AI advancement,\" noting how the firm leveraged \"widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant\" \u2013 the latter apparently referring to controls put in place by the Biden administration that prohibit U.S. manufacturers from selling such specialized chips to firms in China.\n\nEtzioni said the open-source nature of DeepSeek also could challenge the profitability of other AI firms aiming to charge third parties for access to their products.\n\n\"We're soon going to see many models built on DeepSeek,\" Etzioni said."

Known for their expertise in electronic voice phenomena (EVP), the Constantinos brought a unique blend of humour and skill to the show, making them fan favourites. However, beneath their on-screen chemistry lay a troubled relationship marked by domestic strife.\n\nGhost Adventures stars. Photo: @GhostAdventures (modified by author)\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nMark and Debby Constantino were notable figures in the paranormal investigation community, particularly recognised for their Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) expertise. They gained fame by appearing on the Travel Channel's popular series Ghost Adventures, where they contributed to various episodes by capturing purported ghostly voices and sounds.\n\nWhat happened to the Constantino couple?\n\nOn a quiet September morning in 2015, in the eerie silence of Sparks, Nevada, the news of the Ghost Adventures couple found dead in Nevada broke out. The couple (Mark and Debby Constantino) had a darker side to their story.\n\nTheir journey from paranormal enthusiasts to tragic figures unfolded with a backdrop of domestic violence and legal battles, culminating in an event that left the paranormal community and fans of the show in disbelief and mourning.\n\nBackground and rise to fame\n\nMark and Debby Constantino were initially celebrated for their work in electronic voice phenomena (EVP), a method used in paranormal research to capture the voices of spirits on recording devices. They appeared on Ghost Adventures, where they helped analyse audio evidence for signs of ghostly communication.\n\nTheir work was not only a part of the show's appeal but also contributed significantly to the field of paranormal investigation, making them beloved figures in this niche community. Their dynamic, often seen as playful banter on the show, made their appearances memorable. However, there were signs of a troubled relationship behind this public persona.\n\nDomestic strife and public records\n\nThe Constantinos' relationship had a history of domestic violence, which became public knowledge through several court documents and police reports.\n\n2012 incident\n\nMark filed for a temporary restraining order against Debby, claiming he feared she might stab him while intoxicated. He withdrew the request the following day, but this incident was the first public hint of their domestic issues.\n\nAugust 2015\n\nA more severe incident led to Mark being charged with kidnapping, domestic battery by strang, and domestic battery. That stemmed from an altercation where Mark allegedly dragged Debby from a car, leading to her filing for divorce and seeking a protective order. Their daughter, Raquel, was also implicated in this incident.\n\n10 September 2015\n\nDebby filed for divorce from Mark, citing his control over their finances and alleging that he was \"bleeding the accounts dry.\" She sought spousal support and the return of their business, which she claimed to have created.\n\nThe Constantinos had a long history of domestic abuse allegations against each other, including multiple restraining orders filed over the years. Debby had previously accused Mark of severe physical abuse, claiming he had beaten and strangled her during confrontations.\n\nIn one instance, she described being dragged from her car and assaulted until police officers intervened. Mark and Debby's history of violence was well-documented in court records and was known to local law enforcement. Both had filed protective orders against each other at various times, indicating a deeply troubled relationship that escalated over time.\n\nThese events painted a starkly different picture from their on-screen camaraderie, revealing a relationship fraught with violence and legal battles.\n\nThe final days\n\nThe events leading to their deaths unfolded tragically on 22 September 2015. They include:\n\n22 September 2015\n\nThe day of the incident began with a disturbing discovery. Debby's roommate found James Anderson, a third roommate, dead from a gunshot wound in their shared apartment. Concerned for Debby's safety, the roommate contacted the police, fearing she might also be in danger.\n\nThe morning of 22 September\n\nPolice tracked Debby's mobile phone to an apartment rented by their daughter, where Mark was staying. When officers knocked on the door around 11:15 AM, they heard shots fired from inside. Mark shouted that he had Debby and demanded time to \"gather his thoughts,\" threatening her life if his demands were not met.\n\nThe police attempted to negotiate with Mark for several hours. However, communication ceased after a certain point, leading authorities to breach the door using explosives.\n\nDiscovery of bodies\n\nUpon entering, police found both Mark and Debby deceased from gunshot wounds. Mark had shot Debby twice before turning the gun on himself. The investigation revealed that Mark had also been involved in the earlier murder of James Anderson.\n\nImpact on the Paranormal Community\n\nGhost Adventures couple Mark and Debby Constantino pose for the camera. Photo: @GhostAdventures\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nThe paranormal community and Ghost Adventures fans were left in shock and mourning. The show's cast and crew expressed profound sadness and confusion over the incident, with Zak Bagans, the host, tweeting that it was a \"very tragic dark day.\"\n\nThe event sparked discussions about the emotional toll of dealing with the paranormal, possibly exacerbating underlying personal issues.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe immediate aftermath included tributes from fans and peers, some of whom speculated on the influence of their paranormal activities on their personal lives, though these theories remain unsubstantiated.\n\nThere was a notable episode of Ghost Adventures where the crew attempted to contact Zak Bagan's friends who passed away, Mark and Debby, which was met with mixed reactions regarding the ethics of such an investigation.\n\nDespite their deaths, Debby and Mark left a legacy in the paranormal community through their contributions to EVP and the cautionary tale of their personal lives. Their story has since been a topic of discussion in forums and among paranormal enthusiasts, often as a lesson on the importance of mental health and the dangers of domestic violence.\n\nFAQs about Mark and Debby Constantino\n\nWhat happened to Debby Constantino from Ghost Adventures?

            "article_content": "But the business continued to operate, and Nu\u00f1ez and a general manager were issued citations in December .\n\nThe decision by the Burrillville Town Council followed months of controversies surrounding the historic property made famous by \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d movie franchise and its owner, Jacqueline Nu\u00f1ez, including allegations from former employees that Nu\u00f1ez owed them money.\n\nSince then, there have been \u201cno signs of activity\u201d at the house, Burrillville police Chief Stephen Lynch confirmed to the Globe on Monday.\n\nSpeculation over the future of the property sparked again last week after Burrillville Town Manager Michael C. Wood told The Providence Journal a YouTuber named Elton Castee asked him earlier this month what would be required to reopen the house to the public if he and comedian Matt Rife were able to purchase the property.\n\nGet Rhode Map A weekday briefing from veteran Rhode Island reporters, focused on the things that matter most in the Ocean State. Enter Email Sign Up\n\nIn September, Castee wrote in a post on X that he and Rife were \u201cready and willing to buy\u201d the home if Nu\u00f1ez was \u201ckeen to sell.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWood, who did not respond to inquiries from the Globe on Monday, told the The Journal the property needs a fire alarm and upgrades to its sprinkler system, among other things.\n\n\u201cWe still want it to be a successful venture,\u201d Wood told the newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019d like to hear from Jacqueline and have some resolution to it. I think there\u2019s a win-win out there.\u201d\n\nNeither Castee nor Rife could be reached for comment on Monday.\n\n\n\nNu\u00f1ez: \u2018I have heard nothing\u2019\n\nIn a text message to the Globe, Nu\u00f1ez wrote she had not heard from either Rife or Castee. She did not answer a question about whether she would consider selling the house or if she has plans to reopen it herself.\n\n\u201cI have heard nothing. I fear for my safety,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez wrote. \u201cI have had kidnapping threats from Burrillville people if I set foot on the Conjuring House property.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLynch, in an email, wrote police are \u201cnot aware of any threats\u201d to Nu\u00f1ez.\n\nAccording to the The Conjuring House website, the business is listed as closed until further notice, and it states that an update will be given on a reopening \u201cas soon as we know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTCH will open for business again,\u201d the website states. \u201cOur stateside and worldwide following is extensive and you, our guests, deserve access to the most famous paranormal location in the world!\u201d\n\nThe website also states Nu\u00f1ez plans to file several lawsuits, including one against the Town of Burrillville for the \u201carbitrary and capricious non-renewal of the TCH Business License in violation of Constitutional and Administrative State, Federal and International Laws.\u201d\n\nNu\u00f1ez has had other issues with town officials, as well, outside of The Conjuring House. In October, she was arrested by police after she allegedly led officers on a chase through town while driving under the influence. She has denied the accusations.\n\nWho else has owned the Conjuring House?\n\nAlso known as the Old Arnold estate, the property was previously home to eight generations of the Arnold family since 1736.\n\nThe house\u2019s infamous backstory came in the 1970s when paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren conducted a seance in 1973 in an attempt to rid the home of spirits said to be tormenting the Perron family, who was living there at the time.\n\nIn later years, Norma Sutcliff lived in the house for more than three decades before she sold the home in 2019.\n\nAfter the release of the 2013 film, \u201cThe Conjuring,\u201d Sutcliff, who has disputed notions of any haunted or otherworldly phenomenon at the home, said she was subjected to constant harassment by thrill-seekers and horror fans who wanted to lay their eyes on the storied property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEver since the movie came out, we\u2019ve been harassed, trespassed, stalked, and besieged,\u201d Sutcliff told the Globe in 2015. \u201cThey come at all times of the day. Last Saturday, I called police at 3:30 a.m. because there was a whole group of them outside the house. It\u2019s horrendous.\u201d\n\nSutcliff ultimately sold the property in 2019 to Cory and Jennifer Heinzen, two paranormal investigators from Maine who had a vision to restore the home and open it up to the curious public.\n\n\u201cWe immediately fell in love with it,\u201d Heinzen told The Sun Journal at the time. \u201cEight-and-a-half acres, a river in the back and a pond, it\u2019s so serene down there, never mind the story behind the house, it\u2019s a beautiful home.\u201d\n\nThe couple later sold the place to Nu\u00f1ez, who purchased it in 2022, paying about $1.525 million, and pledged to keep the business going.\n\n\u201cI know I have big shoes to fill, and I intend to do it,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nChristopher Gavin can be reached at christopher.gavin@globe.com."

            "article_content": "Earth's biggest hidden mountains revealed deep beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean\n\nScientists find mysterious \"islands\" beneath Earth with unpredictable seismic behavior\n\n\n\nUnusual seismic behaviour revealed Earth's deepest secrets\n\nAlso Read:\n\nScientists have discovered two enormous structures deep inside Earth whose sizes are forcing scientists to rethink the way they see the inside of their planet, at the boundary between Earth's core and the mantle, beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean, these \"islands\" described as continent-sized regions whose temperatures are thousands of degrees higher than the average temperature of the surroundings. According to new research from Utrecht University, these structures are not only gigantic but also old, with origins at least half a billion years ago. The discovery raises new questions about the geological history of the planet and the forces shaping its interior, offering fresh insights into Earth's dynamic evolution.The world's largest mountains have been found deep inside Earth, according to a landmark paper published in the journal Nature today. These giants are some 100 times higher than Mount Everest, rising 1,000 kilometers, while Everest's peak is about 8.8 kilometers above the sea. Researchers estimate that these mountains are at least half a billion years old, dating back to the Earth's formation, over four billion years ago.Scientists say the mountains are at least 500 million years old and probably date back to Earth's origin. Surrounding the mountains is tectonic debris that comes from subduction, in which one tectonic plate is sunk beneath another. Seismic shockwaves have led scientists to reveal these giant land masses hidden in Earth's core and map its interior. The lead researcher, Dr. Arwen Deuss, does not know the origin of these mountains; it is a matter of whether they are transient structures or an old age mountain. This new discovery shook the understanding that existed within geology and further revealed the dynamics into the history of the Earth's interior.LLSVPs Large Low Seismic Velocity Provinces Large blobs of unknown, mysterious material lurking deep beneath our Earth's surface lie at the core-mantle boundary beneath Africa and the Pacific Ocean. Enormous \"islands,\" they are found surrounded by a \"graveyard\" of cold sunken tectonic plates descended through the mantle via subduction. Seismic waves are slowed down as they travel through Earth's interior because of its very high temperatures in these regions.In a new study, researchers Arwen Deuss and Sujania Talavera-Soza approached things differently. Instead of measuring just the slowdown of seismic waves, they measured the waves' damping, or how much energy the waves lose as they travel. Contrary to their expectations, they found that the LLSVPs caused minimal damping, making seismic waves unusually loud, while the surrounding cold tectonic plate graveyard dampened the waves more, offering new insights into Earth's deep interior.The LLSVPs have remained enigmatic with deep, puzzling features located deep in Earth. Located near the boundary between Earth's core and its mantle, LLSVPs are hotter than surrounding tectonic plates. Analyzing seismic waves did something surprising; their energy dissipation or loss due to friction with Earth was lower compared to what has been considered usual, thereby causing the sound emitted to be surprisingly louder than other seismic events.Differently, the cold tectonic plate graveyard exhibited tremendous damping where the waves could be described to be softer. This was contrary to previous assumptions set forth that the upper mantle would dampen the waves. The scientists believe that the LLSVPs are much older and include bigger grain minerals that take less energy absorbed, meaning that explains their unusual seismic response."

The firm\u2019s goal is to work with scientists early and help them commercialize their research more quickly by providing expertise and funding.\n\n\u201cDeerfield is in that missing middle: funding initiatives which cannot be conducted under NIH or NSF funding but are too early stage for angel or venture funding,\u201d says Samir Mayekar, associate vice president and managing director of UChicago's Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation. \"That\u2019s the hardest money to get.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with Deerfield is the latest move by UChicago to step up its game in technology transfer, or commercializing research and creating startup companies. It was a key goal of former President Bob Zimmer, and the effort is picking up under his successor, Paul Alivisatos, a materials-science researcher who has founded several startups.\n\nUChicago launched a deep-technology incubator and created several venture capital funds to help faculty, staff and students launch new companies. The most recent is UCM Ventures, a $25 million fund focused on healthcare startups.\n\nUChicago also will have space for researchers and a life-sciences incubator in a new 14-story office and lab facility called Hyde Park Labs, which is expected welcome its first tenants soon.\n\nBill Slattery, a partner at Deerfield, praised the university for its \"spirit of entrepreneurship that doesn\u2019t abandon the principles of education, which is a tough line to walk. This is a moment in time for U of C to seize that.\"\n\nDeerfield Management and UChicago are calling their partnership Hyde Park Discovery. A committee made up of leadership from the university, the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and Deerfield\u2019s scientific team will evaluate projects.\n\n\"Drug discovery takes time and is expensive,\" Slattery says, adding that Deerfield has made roughly a dozen investments so far at UIC, Northwestern and UIUC."

            "article_content": "As DeepSeek rattles the tech industry, OpenAI is charging ahead with a new product release: ChatGPT Gov.\n\nOn Tuesday, OpenAI announced a \"tailored\" ChatGPT version for government agencies with enhanced cybersecurity frameworks that can be deployed on Microsoft Azure's government cloud servers or Azure commercial.\n\n\"Self-hosting ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance requirements,\" the announcement states. Additionally, OpenAI believes \"this infrastructure will expedite internal authorization of OpenAI\u2019s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\"\n\nThe timing of OpenAI's announcement coincides with the wave of DeepSeek news that has challenged OpenAI's position as the dominant AI force. Last week, the Chinese company released its DeepSeek R1 model that is just as good as ChatGPT, free to use as a web app, and has an API that's significantly cheaper to use. Then there's the claim that it cost DeepSeek $6 million to train its model, compared to OpenAI's $100 million, a cost efficiency that's making Wall Street question how much money is needed to scale AI.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories?

Much like the concerns about TikTok, the China-based ChatGPT competitor raises questions about the how the U.S. government will respond to the LLM which stores its data locally on Chinese servers, potentially exposing it to the Chinese government.\n\nFrom a tactical standpoint, OpenAI seems to be positioning itself as a safe and secure ally to take on Chinese threats.\n\nWhether the ChatGPT Gov announcement was pre-planned or prompted by the DeepSeek mania is unclear. But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman remains unfazed \u2014 at least publicly. \"Deepseek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\" said Altman in an X post on Monday. \"We will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! We will pull up some releases.\"\n\nChatGPT Gov has many of the same features as ChatGPT Enterprise, including GPT-4o access, the ability to save and share conversations internally, custom GPT builds, and an \"administrative console\" for IT teams for more customization."

            "article_content": "The market has been surprised by the accomplishments of the recently released R1 reasoning model. In addition, the Chinese startup has open-sourced its models while revealing in its R1 research paper that the highly sophisticated AI was trained at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI\u2019s o1, which caused the stocks of several big tech companies to plummet.\n\nIt took a while, but OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman finally posted about the DeepSeek hype, saying he\u2019s excited to \u201chave a new competitor.\u201d Here\u2019s what he wrote: \u201cDeepSeek\u2019s R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they\u2019re able to deliver for the price. We will obviously deliver much better models and also it\u2019s legit invigorating to have a new competitor.

The world is going to want to use a LOT of AI and really be quite amazed by the next gen models coming. Looking forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond.\u201d\n\nTech. Entertainment. Science.

The Chinese startup only uses 3% to 5% of the resources OpenAI needs for similar progress with ChatGPT.\n\nOne of the problems with the current AI software concerns the cost of developing and using the product. Advanced models like o1 can cost tens of millions to develop. The process requires high-end graphics cards (GPU) that provide the necessary computing power and energy expenditures.\n\nThat\u2019s why finished products like ChatGPT o1 can\u2019t be available for free without limitations. Companies like OpenAI need to cover costs and turn a profit. On the other hand, DeekpSeek researchers took another approach for R1, finding ways to train an advanced reasoning model without access to the same hardware.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that, but DeepSeek made access to R1 much cheaper than OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, which is a significant development. Add in the open-source nature of DeepSeek models, and you can see why developers would flock to test the Chinese firm\u2019s AI and why DeepSeek would surge in the App Store."

To coincide with our Predictions event on thedrum.com, each day this week we are spotlighting agencies that we believe are primed to set the agenda in the months to come.\n\nIn part one, we examined why the likes of AMV BBDO, Hearts & Science and Code and Theory are among the ones to watch this year. Today, we introduce you to 10 more agencies \u2013 some already firmly established, others on the march \u2013 that are due recognition based on their achievements in 2024 and what they promise to deliver from here on out.\n\nWe will continue to reveal the featured agencies in a series of articles until the end of this week. They hail from all corners of the world and represent a diverse range of specialisms. But what they all have in common is that they have earned The Drum Recommends status on the strength of their recent performance.\n\nSo now, it\u2019s over to our next 10 Agencies to Watch to learn about the secrets of their success so far and what makes them believe 2025 will be their year.\n\nThe President\u2019s Award winner at The Drum Awards for Content 2024 will be eager to continue proving itself as a jewel in the IPG crown as its mega-merger with Omnicom takes shape.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nEmma Armstrong, CEO: For many reasons, I think we\u2019re going to see a continued focus on efficiency in 2025 \u2013 both on the client and agency side. We all know that, if left unchecked, this has the potential to lead to a race to the bottom and the continued erosion of the value and distinctiveness of agencies and our work. We need to shift the industry focus to effectiveness \u2013 that magical combination of insightful, creative ideas that drive real business results for our clients.\n\nSecondly, I think there will be a continued trend of the more successful agencies putting clear water between themselves and the rest of the industry by doubling down on innovation.\n\nOur industry is changing at lightning speed. Our clients \u2013 and the people at our agencies \u2013 are relying on us to keep pace or even outpace the speed of change.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nIn 2024, we brought in 12 new brands looking to make a big creative splash this year. We\u2019re excited to launch new campaigns for Pringles, Cheez-It, Listerine and more in the next few months, starting with Pringles Super Bowl work.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nSpotify \u2018Spreadbeats\u2019: To challenge media planners\u2019 assumptions that Spotify is just an audio platform and showcase our video offerings, we found a way to hack the media RFP process and shift the conversation.\n\nMichelob Ultra \u2018Lap of Legends\u2019: Michelob Ultra wanted to join the Formula 1 conversation, but instead of simply placing their logo on a car, we created \u2018Lap of Legends,\u2019 the world\u2019s first real versus virtual F1 race. Instead of pitching Lap of Legends to prospective media partners, TV and streaming networks actually pitched to host our show on their platforms and brands paid to be featured during the commercial breaks to bring in a $30m ROMI.\n\nFDA Center for Tobacco Products \u2018Toxic Taxidermy\u2019: We\u2019ve built a decade-long partnership with the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products with The Real Cost campaign to prevent teens from using tobacco. In our latest iteration, we warned teens about formaldehyde in their vapes through spokespeople that we knew would get teens to take notice \u2013 taxidermized animals who know the impact of formaldehyde all too well.\n\nBudweiser \u2018Old School Delivery\u2019: Understanding the value of earned impressions, we brought the iconic Budweiser Clydesdales and labrador back to the Super Bowl in epic fashion. The campaign became Budweiser\u2019s most viewed, shared and commented Super Bowl spot in their history and significantly increased purchase intent.\n\nThe purpose-driven agency, which has won acclaim for change campaigns such as its NHS drive placing cancer awareness prompts in unexpected places, is primed to deliver more work that inspires real action in 2025.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nConsumers are done with empty purpose statements. The era of selling through abstract ideals is over. We\u2019re seeing customers demanding authentic action, not rhetoric, so we\u2019re counseling clients to prove their commitment through tangible initiatives, not impressive manifestos. Real change, measurable impact and genuine social responsibility are now the benchmarks for consumer trust. Companies that understand this shift \u2013 those who demonstrate their values through concrete actions will successfully engage modern audiences.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWe\u2019ve got some exciting things planned as we continue to evolve our brand and campaign services that change behavior for the better \u2013 all of which we will share throughout the course of the year. We\u2019ve also just welcomed two exceptional creative talents in Dan McCormack and Luke Boggins into our fold with a proven pedigree working on award-winning international work for blue-chip clients, including McDonald\u2019s, Tesco, Virgin Holidays, Subway and Pfizer. We can\u2019t wait to unleash them and see what we are able to achieve together!\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe\u2019re proud of our innovative NHS \u2018Be Body Aware\u2019 campaign, which integrates health messaging into everyday items such as Morrisons\u2019 underwear labels and Tesco toilet rolls. By placing cancer awareness prompts in unexpected places, our campaign messaging is now in millions of products in our target audiences\u2019 homes, so we\u2019re really helping people take proactive health steps.\n\nWinning the creative account for \u2018This Girl Can\u2019 has been another milestone, adding to the stellar work our PR and partnerships teams have achieved with Sport England this year. As the campaign marks its 10th anniversary, we\u2019re busy with the next phase.\n\nWant to go deeper? Ask The Drum\n\nDavid&Goliath\n\nFresh from celebrating its 25th anniversary, the Californian content and creative agency is readying itself for the next era of helping challenger brands flourish.\n\nDavid&Goliath\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nWith a name like David&Goliath, we welcome new challenges and trends and continue to look at them as opportunities. This year\u2019s turbulence surrounding social platforms will create opportunities for brands to stand out and stand up for their audiences and the world to see. We envision brands being recognized for what they don\u2019t do on platforms as much as, if not more so, than what they do. We\u2019re heading into 2025 by challenging every assumption of what works and why and looking at existing and new platforms to gain an even greater advantage for our brand partners.\n\nWhat\u2019s a trend forecast without a mention of AI? It is integral throughout our process, from strategy to creative to measurement. The speed to outcome frees up our people to focus more on finding opportunities and crafting brave new thinking and ideas.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nThis past year marked a milestone for David&Goliath as we celebrated our 25th anniversary \u2013 a quarter century of helping challenger people and brands face their biggest goliaths and rise to unthinkable heights.\n\nWe continued to live our Brave philosophy from the inside out as we kicked off the anniversary at Cannes by introducing our next Brave initiative with BraveU, a transformative program for young creators, empowering them to bravely own their truth. In addition, we continued to build on our Brave Camp initiative that helps inner city kids of Harlem travel outside their comfort zone and become the best versions of themselves.\n\nFounder and creative chairman David Angelo and long-time veterans Ben Purcell, chief creative officer, and CJ Stockton, chief of operations, expanded the executive leadership at David&Goliath. Amy Chiang was promoted to chief of integration. Michele Tebbe returned to the agency as chief of client services and business growth. And Brendan Robertson was hired for his insightful thinking as our chief strategy officer. Together, this group is working closely across all aspects of the business heading into 2025 and beyond.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe started 2024 helping Kia Save New Year\u2019s in Times Square. Then for the Super Bowl, we launched Kia\u2019s flagship vehicle, the EV9, with a heartfelt campaign that stood out in the sea of celebrities. Then we crashed the big game through social with our Jollibee partners and deep-fried football. And for Vizio, we brought to life a new platform and a few new characters that encouraged the world to \u2018Watch Us.\u2019 In addition, we continued to lead culture as we enlisted the help of hype man Flavor Flav to play the role of the Flavor Genie, who helps America discover the new flavors of Smartfood popcorn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe small but mighty Agency of the Year (under 10 staff) at The Drum Awards for Agency Business has big ambitions for the year ahead.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nGulliver Moore, managing director and founder: As they bend the knee to a new western economic and cultural order, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon will continue dominating, accounting for over 70% of global ad spend growth. Amazon\u2019s retail media expansion highlights the shift towards direct-to-consumer strategies, leveraging first-party data to target buyers more effectively. For marketers, standing out in this data-driven space will require fresh creativity to reach audiences.\n\nAs cookies continue to phase out due to privacy concerns, first-party data is taking center stage. Clean rooms and authenticated targeting are becoming more standard, allowing brands to deliver personalized campaigns while maintaining consumer trust. The challenge for agencies lies in integrating complex data strategies into compelling creative work.\n\nWith nearly 20% growth projected, Connected TV (CTV) platforms like Netflix and YouTube are transforming video advertising. CTV allows for richer storytelling and better targeting than traditional TV, offering brands a new space to captivate audiences with longer-form narratives. Linear TV spend also remains strong, particularly in the UK compared with other markets. We saw this trend reflected in our own work at Sunday Treat, with many TVCs on our slate last year for brands like KLM and Leonardo Hotels airing across the UK and Ireland.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nMoore: We were thrilled to win Agency of the Year last year, which really was our first industry recognition and has given us the confidence to develop more of an awards strategy this year.\n\nWe\u2019ve recently hired a fantastic new business development manager which is part of a complete refresh of our already very successful new biz strategy \u2013 and in anticipation of this investment, we\u2019re bringing in new roles to handle the additional work.\n\nFinally, we\u2019re doubling down on our commitment to \u2018Find the Fun\u2019 in all the projects we work on; it has been an incredibly successful niche for us and so rewarding for the team to be working on fun projects. I categorise all of our projects and last year 67% were in the \u201cfun/ creative\u201d category which is quite simply incredible compared to the start of Sunday Treat in 2021.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nMoore: \u2018Yes It Daz\u2019 was the slogan for the new Daz campaign that we worked on with the influencer Troy Hawke. It was a big brand partnership for him and a big campaign for Daz, which has recently been acquired by a new company. The campaign was a huge success and it was so fun to take the whole team out to Westfield shopping center to see our work on the big screens along with the TV commercials on ITVX.\n\nWe onboarded Canon as a new client, completing many new projects for it, such as the flagship C400 launch video featuring Sarah Thomas Moffatt the Dual Fisheye lens video which we conceptualized with Sam Baumel, the US-based VR filmmaker we brought over from New York.\n\nVirtual Production: we had many VP projects in 2024, but the highlight for me was a currently unreleased project for KLM which saw a huge cast of characters travel to Hong Kong, Rio and Capetown all from our studio in Slough.\n\nOur first Sunday Treat \u2018Original since Sliced Bread\u2019 was shot in 2024, featuring the incredible Alice Etches. It\u2019s about a woman who goes on a date with a half-man/half-goat. Our commitment to short-form comedy is one of the founding principles at Sunday Treat and I\u2019m excited to run the festival circuit with this one and start planning our follow-up this year.\n\nThe Grand Prix winner at The Drum Awards for PR is in a rich vein of form creatively and is on a mission to ensure PR takes its rightful place in the marketing mix.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nKat Arnull, chief strategy officer: PR will continue to shift toward being a marketing mindset over a channel. 2025 will be the year where we see the shift from PR being seen as a marketing channel \u2013 seen as a choice between or amplifier of advertising \u2013 toward PR being seen as a marketing mindset that ensures effectiveness. The breakthrough campaigns will all be devised by using an earned first approach designed to reach audiences on their terms. In a year where we saw a president chosen by a podcast, it\u2019s going to be even more important that we are thinking about how we connect with audiences on multiple levels and challenge the laws that have gone before.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nArnull: Our clients want smart, channel-agnostic thinking, audience-led media strategy and great earned thinking, so over the last year and into next year, we are sharpening our integrated media planning and capabilities by investing in new hires \u2013 such as ex-LadBible\u2019s Gemma Combellack as consumer EVP and Gareth Davies as integrated media EVP, social director Paige Hiley, as well as building out our influencer team.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nArnull: Our \u2018Misheard Version\u2019 work with Specsavers won seven Cannes Lions in 2024, including two Grand Prix with the first ever PR Lion Grand Prix won by a PR agency\u2019s creative idea, truly showing the power of an earned-first idea.\n\nAsics \u2018Desk Break\u2019: We recruited the world\u2019s scariest boss, Brian Cox, to deliver a rousing public service announcement to desk workers, calling on them to reject wellness perks like \u2018Wellness Wednesdays\u2019 and to \u2018f**k the fruit\u2019 to instead take a 15-minute #DeskBreak to move for your mind. Supported by research and The Desk Break experiment by Dr Brendon Stubbs that proved the benefits of a 15-minute break, the campaign took the world by storm, reaching over 2.7 billion with the director general of the World Health Organisation organically sharing our work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving expanded its digital expertise with the acquisition of Don\u2019t be Shy last autumn, the fast-growing B2B specialist continues to thrive with brands that have a complex route to market or a technical product to sell.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nThere is growing recognition in the benefits of working with an agency that exemplifies a truly positive culture. Our managing director, Alexander Swann, spoke on this topic at B2B World Fest recently and the importance of looking beyond talent, strategy, creativity and effectiveness, instead focusing on what makes a positive agency culture and invest in it. The result is the agency will yield talented people, who take pride in doing a great job for their clients. Positive culture is one of the single biggest force multipliers to campaign success. Agencies not getting this right has sunk more campaigns \u2013 and client budgets \u2013 than we care to mention. If those working on an account aren\u2019t giving their all, then you\u2019re likely to get mediocrity (or worse) back in return. So why would clients not make agency culture a big part of your selection process?\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWe\u2019ve now fully integrated our acquisition of Manchester-based Don\u2019t be Shy. In the next year, we\u2019ll crack on as an expanded agency with impressive digital skills that perfectly complement our strategy, PR and creative specialisms. People from both offices are working on some major campaigns with big B2B names in the tech, construction and telecom industries \u2013 so you\u2019ll be hearing a lot more from us in the coming months.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWe won numerous awards in 2024, spanning all parts of the agency, including PR, creative, strategy and digital. From a brand perspective, it was extremely satisfying to develop a product identity and creative campaign for Polypipe Building Services that led to tens of millions in sales for it. On the demand side, campaigns for KBR, a global project engaging the world\u2019s biggest energy companies, and for Finning, the world\u2019s largest Caterpillar\u00e2 dealer, together generated over \u00a330m in qualified leads. We\u2019ve also supported Michelin on a global basis as it repositioned its B2B offering and continued projects with TalkTalk Business and Marks & Spencer.\n\nWith its first acquisition on the horizon, the winner of Agency of the Year (11-49 staff) at The Drum Awards for Agency Business is gearing itself up for further growth at home in the UK and beyond.\n\nManifest\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nAlex Myers, chief executive officer and founder: AI will go from crappy PR stunts to integral operational catalyst, with agencies super-charging teams with their own bespoke and customized systems and protocols. The era of purpose is well and truly over, but we\u2019ll see positive impact brands thrive by delivering enhanced experiences, not just better practices, ushering in an era of \u2018progress-driven marketing.\u2019\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nMyers: We\u2019ll be kicking off 2025 by completing our first acquisition (coming soon\u2026) Our team in Australia is set to double in size by the end of 2025, with some big wins about to be announced imminently. We are looking to expand our proprietary systems into software products for agency and in-house teams, including our creator management platform, Roger, and our omnichannel reporting framework, The Loop.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nMyers: Our recent campaign with Rewearing is Caring saw pioneering cleaning brand Ecover partnering with model and sustainability activist Lily Cole to urge Brits to stop over-washing and start rewearing. Hundreds of consumers swarmed to attend the pre-loved pop-up store and panel, hosted in partnership with Charity Super.Mkt, ready to snap up a designer bargain and learn about how they can be more sustainable.\n\nStateside, we drove a nationwide plant-based pizza trial inspired by the master manipulators with Daiya\u2019s Pizza Pyramid Scheme. Over 12,000 people got their first taste of plant-based pizza through peer-to-peer recommendations, discovering a new world of dairy-free deliciousness.\n\nWe rebranded the iconic Michigan Theater Foundation to Marquee Arts, a contemporary new look and proposition that modernized the much-loved institution while maintaining its unique heritage and setting it up for its next exciting chapter as a shining light for the Arts.\n\nSuggested newsletters for you Daily Briefing Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

The Drum Insider Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum.\n\nAfter a dominant display at The Drum Awards for B2B, the women-led US agency is investing in both AI and talent to continue its momentum.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nDoug Kamp, chief creative officer: All the buzz in the last year has been about the application of AI. And while many have seen demonstrative benefits in digital, media, personalization,and administrative efficiency, creative application has been incredibly inconsistent. As a tool to coalesce thinking and ideation, it\u2019s been amazing. As a tool to execute final production, it\u2019s been incredibly inconsistent and still a bit austere.\n\nWhich leads me to one a few top trends: authenticity. Brand affection is a key tenet of Mower strategy and creative \u2013 along with relevance and trust. Whether a remnant of the recent election cycle, or a result of the constant bombardment of digital and traditional media, authenticity, driven by empathy, is driving longer-term brand connections.\n\nVisual creative continues to drive increased engagement and growth. It\u2019s no surprise that video and social content continues to provoke customers. 2025 will see this trend ascend. Against the cacophony of political noise and talking heads, visual entertainment, storytelling, and simplicity is driving stickier\u2014and more deeply emotional-- connections (re: Pavio\u2019s \u2018Picture-Superiority Effect\u2019). This is especially true for target audiences not currently in the market to buy.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nAs a women-led organization, we\u2019re excited to secure our WBENC certification in 2025 to support clients with diverse procurement goals. We\u2019re investing in AI to enhance operations and empower faster, smarter work in strategy, creative and media. Our talent development initiatives include mentorship programs, emerging leaders training, a coach-in-residence for emotional intelligence and Disc. We\u2019re advancing analytics with a focus on attribution challenges and strengthening industry expertise through our B2B, financial services, travel & tourism, energy & sustainability and healthcare specialties. Lastly, we\u2019re deepening ties with our global networks like IPREX and TheNetworkOne to drive growth and innovation.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nMower has had an extraordinary run of exceptional work, culminating in 10 The Drum B2B Awards, plus B2B Marketing and ANA B2B Agency of the Year. And Best B2B Campaign from the Indie Awards. The biggest contributor to this recognition has been our breakthrough work for Carhartt. While consumers love the brand, Carhartt\u2019s business offering, which focused on uniforms, were relatively unknown. We launched Carhartt\u2019s first B2B campaign, \u2018More Than a Uniform,\u2019 positioning Carhartt as not only the best workwear but also a competitive business advantage. This resulted in an incredible +105% increase in revenue and 150% increase in sales. Oh, and our client was named \u2018Marketer of the Year.\u2019\n\nA second standout has been our work for energy provider FirstEnergy. Here, we were asked to educate drone pilots on the dangers of flying in and around power lines. Mower\u2019s internal research team discovered that these \u2018Drone Daredevils\u2019 are competitive thrill seekers who push limits and regulations. And likely wouldn\u2019t respond to straightforward education messages. The solution? Give them what they crave \u2013 a gamified experience fueled by adrenaline but driven by safety education, FirstEnergy\u2018s \u2018Drone Safety Zone Racing Game.\u2019 In just one year, the campaign flew far past our goals, with nearly 300,000 gameplays that included safety education, proving safety scores big when you know how to play their game.\n\nFresh off its strongest year, the punchy public relations agency enters its 10th year with its ambition to stand apart from \u201cboring PR\u201d as strong as ever.\n\nRomans\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nJoe Mackay-Sinclair, founder and chief executive officer: A succession of old network guys talking about return to work. Followed by a succession of old network guys talking about the death of purpose, ESG and all the other stuff they don\u2019t like. Hopefully swiftly followed by a spate of exciting new startups led by disgruntled ex-old-network employees.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nMackay-Sinclair: The Romans invested in new PR hotshop, Earnies, last year and it is absolutely flying. This year, we\u2019d be quite keen to invest in someone else\u2019s rage-quit startup. So, if you\u2019ve just been told to return to work, why not get in touch? Internationally, The Romans\u2019 offices in London, Amsterdam, Dubai and Brooklyn are all knitting together really nicely and in 30%+ growth. It feels like the next expansion will be in Berlin. Or Riyadh. Or Singapore. Watch this space.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nMackay-Sinclair: When it comes to work, it\u2019s been a vintage year. Our Lidl Croissant Bag became the first carb to conquer London Fashion Week. We worked with Finnish metalheads Lordi to record Made Of Metal, a wild new track to launch OnePlus\u2019s new metal phone. We helped serial Wimbledon runner-up Andy Roddick win his first Wimbledon title by taking over Wimbledon, North Dakota (population: 144) and mowing the town\u2019s first tennis court. We got Nationwide into the fried chicken shop game to launch its new student account with NationFried. And we melted LinkedIn for hot takes when our Freeway truck hit the road in December as some people felt it bore a passing resemblance to another famous Christmas campaign.\n\nEmbracing disruption across our digital world, the social agency is determined to make 2025 the year creators and the C-suite collide.\n\nWhat trends will shape the industry in 2025?\n\nNeil Waller, group co-founder and co-chief executive officer: 2025 will be the year that the creator economy evolves from a marketing footnote to a boardroom priority. As creators move from the fringes of culture to the mainstream, C-suite executives are developing a deeper awareness of creators and their full potential. This year, we\u2019ll see that the creator economy will be cemented as a critical topic in business strategy and cultural conversations.\n\nThe creator economy in 2025 will mark a significant evolution, defined by increased professionalism, strategic planning and technological innovation.\n\nGenerative AI will also play a transformative role, with creators adopting tools for tasks such as editing, animation, captions and workflow optimization. Platforms and startups alike are developing solutions to enhance efficiency and unlock new creative possibilities. Compared with traditional media, creators are agile, non-unionized and aggregate younger. Therefore, their adoption of an AI toolset is going to be quicker. As a result, it is going to be transformative for the creator economy.\n\nWhat does the agency have planned for 2025?\n\nWaller: At Whalar, 2025 is our year of impact and disruption, driven by the unstoppable momentum of the creator revolution. From the Whalar Group level, we are thrilled about launching The Lighthouse, a first-of-its-kind Creator campus in Venice in February. Game-changing partnerships with Tribeca, iHeartMedia and LinkedIn continue to redefine possibilities, while campaigns with clients such as Anthropic, NFL, Oatly and eBay bring new opportunities to the forefront. We\u2019re also navigating emerging platforms and adapting to potential TikTok shifts. From pitching \u2018The Whalar Way\u2019 to the UK government to activating at Coachella and the Super Bowl, 2025 is all about bold moves and shaping the future of the creator economy.\n\nWhat work were you most proud of in 2024?\n\nWaller: Whalar\u2019s 2024 highlights are a testament to the power of creativity and cultural resonance. Standout campaigns include the NFL Creator of the Week initiative, which celebrates dynamic and engaging content and Twinings partnering with creators to reveal a \u201cnew way to tea.\u201d Mozilla Firefox captivated Gen Z audiences with authentic conversations about data privacy, while J2O \u2018Posh Perspectives\u2019 brought a touch of storytelling sophistication to beverage marketing. Our long-term partnership with Diageo creator campaigns elevated global spirits brands to new heights. Oatly\u2019s bold Moofia takedown sparked industry buzz and Waymo\u2019s collaboration with creators, especially Sooraj\u2019s video, redefined how tech stories are told. Each project demonstrates Whalar\u2019s ability to unlock the full potential of creativity through creators while driving cultural impact."

(Image: Courtesy Faculty of Science research team)\n\nA new discovery has unveiled the origin of a strange whitish-grey patch seen with the northern lights. This phenomenon, now termed a \"structured continuum emission,\" offers fresh insight into the aurora borealis\u2019 complexities.\n\nAurora's Hidden Companion\n\nThe unusual pale patch often appears alongside dynamic auroras. Dr Emma Spanswick, a physics professor at the University of Calgary, led the study. \u201cThis patch is intricately linked with the aurora,\u201d she explained. Researchers have now confirmed it is a heat source, making the aurora even more complex.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nWhile previously noted in scientific records, its nature remained a mystery. Published in Nature Communications, the study marks the first clear explanation.\n\nRole of Advanced Camera Technology\n\nThe discovery relied on cutting-edge camera sensors capturing true-colour images.

Organizations reported that resource constraints, heavy administrative overhead, and lack of automation in their ITSM programs hold them back from improved service execution. (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nTeamDynamix sponsored an IDC study and white paper to look deeper at how IT leaders are addressing ITSM modernization efforts. Key findings highlight that 63% of participants use some form of AI-enabled automation, and 54% have an AI-enabled technician assistant. Currently, 39% of respondents report using GenAI-enabled knowledge management. Additional organizations are prioritizing these implementations over the next 12\u201318 months as part of a broader ITSM modernization initiative. ITSM modernization is accelerating with the adoption of automation and AI to reduce the time IT teams are spending on manual, mundane tasks to instead focus on improved user experiences.\n\nTeamDynamix Outlook: Key Trends for ITSM in 2025 \u2013 The Rise of No-Code Automation and AI is Driving Agility and Easing IT Teams\u2019 Burden Amid Increasing Demands\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio, January 28, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--IT leaders are rapidly adopting automation and AI to fuel IT Service Management (ITSM) modernization initiatives. As demands for IT resources continue to rise, IT leaders are challenged to increase operational efficiency while delivering superior user experiences. TeamDynamix ITSM/ESM customers are rapidly embracing Conversational AI and AI ITSM as CIOs seek increased throughput and have higher expectations for performance.\n\n\"ITSM modernization isn\u2019t just about improving IT\u2014it\u2019s about enabling agility across the entire enterprise,\" explains TeamDynamix Chief Product Officer Andrew Graf. \"At the heart of agility lies no-code automation paired together with AI. This combination is revolutionizing the IT service desk by eliminating manual bottlenecks, empowering teams to work faster, delivering better insights and enabling seamless alignment with broader business goals.\"\n\n\"The unique ability of the platform to leverage AI with the underlying integration hub and automation layer is fueling rapid adoption,\" adds Graf. \"We are seeing the most interesting, unique use cases emerge \u2013 there\u2019s the obvious use for information retrieval or efficient content generation, but we can take you further when you pair conversational AI with automation.\"\n\nKey use cases for ITSM automation with AI include on/offboarding, equipment replacement, PTO balance inquiries, requisition requests and more.\n\nITSM Modernization Trends to Watch in 2025\n\nTo further explore these emerging trends, TeamDynamix sponsored an IDC White Paper, Bridging the Maturity Gap to Modernize IT Service Management*, that looked at the top challenges and priorities facing IT leaders today.\n\nKey Findings:\n\nAutomation Reduces Time Spent on Routine Tasks - The study reveals that 63% of IT leaders spend between 1\u20134 hours weekly on manual tasks like equipment replacement, system audits/compliance checks, onboarding and software provisioning, with 20% reporting 4+ hours per week. Automating these processes could optimize the service desk to unlock significant productivity gains and free IT teams to focus on innovation.\n\nEnterprise-Wide Integration Is Falling Short - While 80% of organizations have some basic ITSM integrations, fewer than 35% report their systems as fully operational across the ecosystem \u2013 hindering true digital transformation. Equally limiting is the deployment of Enterprise Service Management (ESM). Only 35% of respondents have extended ITSM workflows for ESM to departments beyond IT including HR, finance and facilities, highlighting a critical need for tools that enable true ESM.\n\nAI Is Transforming Service Management - Nearly 63% of organizations are exploring AI-enabled automation to streamline ticket management, with 32% fully implementing AI for case resolution and 39% utilizing AI for knowledge-based content creation. AI drives efficiencies across service management by enabling faster resolutions, automating ticket handling, improving employee self-service, enabling advanced chat interactions and expediting access to information.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Originally published by Illumio.\n\nWritten by Christer Swartz, Solutions Marketing Director, Illumio.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Gartner, \u201cBy 2026, 60% of enterprises working toward zero trust architecture will use more than one deployment form of microsegmentation, which is up from less than 5% in 2023.\u201d\n\nMicrosegmentation is foundational to zero trust. You can\u2019t achieve zero trust without it.\n\nIn fact, John Kindervag, the creator of Zero Trust, addressed the connection between zero trust and segmentation in the second report ever written on the topic, Build Security Into Your Network\u2019s DNA: The Zero Trust Network Architecture. In the report, he said, \u201cNew ways of segmenting networks must be created because all future networks need to be segmented by default.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re building a zero trust architecture, microsegmentation should be a crucial part of your plan. Here are the 10 things you can expect to do when starting out with microsegmentation.\u200d\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Get visibility into all workload traffic across every environment\n\nThe first \u2014 and one of the most important \u2014 steps of building microsegmentation is being able to know what\u2019s going on across all segments in your network. How do you see all traffic between all workloads across your cloud, endpoint, and data center environments? It\u2019s crucial to be able to achieve this level of visibility at any scale without an overly complex workflow.\n\nYou can try to use different visibility tools for different segments across your network. But using multiple tools will create a fragmented view. This can make it challenging to understand behavior across all segments everywhere.\n\nInstead, find a solution that can discover traffic across all segments and display it in one view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200d2. Understand how apps are communicating\n\nMost people agree that Zero Trust is a good idea, but how can you understand what traffic is required before deciding what to protect? It\u2019s not always easy to see what apps are running across your network and what ports they need to use.\n\nWith the right solution, you can discover what applications are running on all workloads and what ports they\u2019re using. This provides a comprehensive inventory of all applications and their dependencies in your network so you can decide how to enforce segmentation policy.\n\n\u200d\n\n3. Lock down your most critical, highest-risk resources\n\nNot all entry points into your network are under your direct control. While a data center for a campus network might have strong controls in place, resources in the cloud or partners\u2019 third-party access are often less secure.\n\nMany threats start from these less-secure environments because they\u2019re often left open due to human error. Any of these access points can be an attacker\u2019s first step in the door, allowing threats to move across your network to your high-value assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dotted lines represent open ports between environments which allow malware to spread through the network.\n\nThat\u2019s where a microsegmentation solution can help you secure these vulnerable parts of your network. No matter where a breach happens, microsegmentation will block it from reaching critical resources that you\u2019ve segmented. The breach will be isolated to the other side of that segment so it can\u2019t cause further damage. \u200d\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Label workloads by business functions, not network addresses\n\nIn today\u2019s modern networks, workloads are deployed across a hybrid, multi-cloud architecture. This makes network addresses ephemeral. A workload\u2019s network address can change dynamically depending on the underlying hosting environment.\n\nThat\u2019s why you should label workloads using human-readable labels rather than traditional IP addresses. With a microsegmentation solution, you can identify workloads by their business function or ownership \u2014 such as their role, application, environment, location, operating system, or business unit \u2014 which is a lot more informative their using an IP address.\n\nBy using human-readable labels, you get a metadata-driven solution for seeing how segments between workloads are enforced that is fully decoupled from network address. \u200d\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Decide on an agent and agentless approach\n\nWhen building microsegmentation, it's important to understand when an agent or agentless approach works best. Some solutions give you a choice between using agents or not so that you can get visibility and segmentation across all workloads in every environment.\n\nAgent approach\n\nCollects telemetry about application use on and between workloads. This allows you to control access to segments directly at the workload.\n\nAgentless approach\n\nDiscovers and enforces the use of segments without an agent.\n\nThis is crucial in environments that can\u2019t support agents, like IoT devices in the manufacturing or healthcare industries. It\u2019s also key in environments that can\u2019t use agents because of compliance requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200d6. Start with a denylist model, then move to an allowlist model\n\nA common challenge teams run into when building microsegmentation is that they know the ports they want to deny, but they don\u2019t fully understand all the ports they need to allow for applications.\n\nRansomware commonly uses ports such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Server Message Block (SMB) to move across segments between workloads. But we know that these ports rarely need to be open between workloads.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s best practice to start with a denylist model. Block only the ports you know shouldn\u2019t be open and allow all others. Then, when you have a full understanding of what ports applications need, you can switch to an allowlist model. Keep only the required ports open and block all others.\n\nThis approach allows you to begin building microsegmentation by ransomware today and tightening policy when you\u2019re ready.\n\n\u200d\n\n7. Model policy before it\u2019s deployed\n\nCybersecurity has long relied on a deploy-and-pray approach. Security teams create a policy model and modify it until it looks correct. Then, when it\u2019s deployed, they pray the phone doesn\u2019t ring from broken application dependencies.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s best to test your policy before it's fully deployed. Modeling ensures your policy can be deployed safely without the risk of inadvertently breaking application dependencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Extend consistent segmentation across the hybrid multi-cloud\n\nIf you use a solution that can only build segmentation in the data center, then you\u2019re unlikely to get consistent security in other environments like the cloud. Segmentation should never be dependent on a single environment. This will result in a siloed approach to segmentation which will only leave vulnerabilities and make it harder to stop and contain breaches.\n\nInstead, microsegmentation needs to follow the workload as it migrates across environments. This ensures that segmentation doesn\u2019t break as workloads are hosting in different environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u200d9. Automate security changes without relying on human decisions\n\nMalware spreads faster than any human can type on a keyboard. It\u2019s crucial to have a microsegmentation solution that can automate policy changes as fast as a breach can spread.\n\n\u200d\n\n10. Prove security is in compliance\n\nQuantifying risk can be challenging, since securing applications and segments can involve many moving parts. During an audit, it\u2019s not always easy to get a clear picture of existing risk and how it\u2019s lowered after security policy is applied. It\u2019s important to use tools that show this before and after comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nChrister Swartz is Solutions Marketing Director at Illumio.

            "article_content": "The father who adopted Natalia Grace, the Ukrainian orphan who allegedly made several attempts to kill him and his wife, broke down during an awkward confrontation that saw the pair reunite.\n\nViewers were stunned when docuseries The Curious Case of Natalia Grace: Natalia Speaks dropped in 2023, detailing Natalia - who has a rare form of dwarfism - and her adoption story.\n\nHusband and wife Kristine and Michael Barnett took in who they believed to be a six-year-old into their Indiana home in 2010. Then years after she was accused of being a 22-year-old, Michael sat down with Natalia to have a very awkward conversation. Watch below:\n\nJust months after Natalia was adopted, the Barnett family claimed she was an 'adult sociopath masquerading as a child' who allegedly tried to kill them.\n\nAdvert\n\n\"She tried to poison and kill my wife,\" Michael claimed, \"One night, I opened my eyes and Natalia is standing at the foot of the bed with a knife in her hand.\"\n\nAlthough Natalia has continuously denied all of the allegations made against her, the woman's age was legally changed in 2012 - and health testing company TruDiagnostic estimated that she was about 22-years-old.\n\nNow, the clip which was released by Investigation Discovery last year, Natalia is seen reuniting with Michael and asking him: \"Why are we here?\"\n\n\"Why are we here?\" responded Michael, \"If you're talking philosophically.\"\n\nAdvert\n\nThe confrontation between Natalia Grace and her former adoptive father was very awkward (Investigation Discovery)\n\n\"No, I want to know, why did you adopt me in the first place?\" she then asked.\n\n\"Many of these questions there's not going to be a single answer to,\" he told her, whilst alleging he was manipulated and mistreated by Kristine, his now ex-wife.\n\nIn the documentary, Natalia alleges that she was abused by Kristine, claiming that she pepper-sprayed her multiple times and hit her with a belt.\n\nAdvert\n\nKristine has denied the accusations from both Natalia and Michael.\n\n\"What do you mean by you were a victim?\" Natalia asked, to which Michael replied: \"This is not easy. I had the same monster you did.\"\n\n\"I was exceptionally controlled and put down and threatened, was minimalised, anything that was who I was was ripped from me and I was guided and instructed to be exactly what she wanted me to be,\" he went on.\n\nHe stormed off set (Investigation Discovery)\n\nAdvert\n\nMichael seemed to be getting nowhere with his former adopted daughter and stormed out of the interview following a confrontation with people behind the camera.\n\n\"I tried, I tried,\" he repeated as he walked off set.\n\nHaving made headlines a couple of years ago, Natalia has provided a fresh update in season three of her docuseries, titled The Curious Case of Natalia Grace: The Final Chapter.\n\nNatalia has now settled in with Nicole DePaul, 49, and her husband Vince, 51 - who also have dwarfism - in upstate New York. The couple tried to adopt her in 2009, but were turned down."

This groundbreaking book examines how human history is shaped by \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies \u2013 that enable unparalleled cooperation. Harari investigates the impact of these revolutions on human society, from the dawn of agriculture and the rise of civilizations to the challenges of the modern world, including climate change, technological disruption, and the search for meaning in the 21st century.\n\nThe Cognitive Revolution: The book begins by examining the unique cognitive abilities that set Homo sapiens apart from other animals. Around 70,000 years ago, a \u201cCognitive Revolution\u201d occurred, leading to the development of advanced language and the ability to create and believe in \u201cshared fictions\u201d \u2013 myths, religions, and ideologies. These shared fictions, while not objectively real, allow humans to cooperate flexibly on a massive scale, a feat unparalleled in the animal kingdom. This cooperation enabled the development of complex social structures, from small tribes to vast empires.\n\nThe Agricultural Revolution: Around 12,000 years ago, humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agriculture. This seemingly revolutionary shift, however, brought about significant drawbacks. Agriculture led to increased inequality, disease, and environmental degradation. Farmers, despite working harder than hunter-gatherers, often had less leisure time and a poorer diet. The domestication of plants and animals also led to the suffering of countless creatures.\n\nThe Scientific Revolution: Beginning in the 16th century, the Scientific Revolution challenged religious dogma and ushered in an era of unprecedented technological and social change. Science provided humans with new tools and knowledge, allowing them to manipulate the natural world on an unprecedented scale. This revolution, however, also brought about new challenges, such as climate change, nuclear war, and the potential for technological disruption.\n\nModern Challenges: Harari explores the profound challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. These include climate change, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the increasing gap between the rich and the poor. He raises critical questions about the meaning of happiness, the future of humanity, and our relationship with technology.\n\nKey Themes:"
