        "article_content": "Do you fondly remember playing 8-bit adventures on the NES and original Sega consoles? Titles like Contra, Ninja Gaiden, and Mega Man 2, all from the late \u201880s, provided a unique gaming experience that\u2019s hard to replicate today with modern technology. Hard, sure, but it\u2019s possible\u2014as we\u2019ve now witnessed firsthand with the release of UFO 50.\n\n\n\nThe collection\u2014presented as a lost collection from a forgotten developer of the era\u2014features an assortment of single- and multiplayer games across multiple genres, from platformers to roguelikes, with even a few in-depth RPGs mixed in. All are created with an 8-bit retro style that harkens back to the days of gaming in your living room after school. You can beat some of the games in mere minutes, then move on to the next; others, however, require a few hours and multiple playthroughs. They\u2019re all unique, many of them are memorable, and some deserve no more than a single run-through.\n\nWhen we sifted through the Steam user reviews, we found an overwhelmingly positive reception from the gaming community. Most people love the indie retro collection and cannot praise the fun factor enough. As you\u2019ll see below, nostalgia plays a significant role in many of the reviews. Numerous players gave a thumbs up because it felt like playing a game from their childhood, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with feeling young again and enjoying your hobby!\n\nBut a few couldn\u2019t get past many titles, which lack the quality-of-life features in modern gaming, or--they say--feel outdated and unnecessarily complex just for nostalgia\u2019s sake. Despite the positive reviews, the negative ones prove highly negative. Many curse out the game and its developers; they shout from the rooftops about how unfun they thought most of the retro titles were to play.\n\nSurprisingly, we didn\u2019t find many meme reviews, just plenty of positive or negative reviews to help you better understand the game. Here is UFO 50, as told by Steam reviews!\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\nScreenshot: Valve / Kotaku\n\n.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."

On March 13th 1997, thousands of people saw a stream of mysterious lights bathe the night sky across Arizona and Nevada for three hours. Being the largest and most reported UFO in history, it was only a matter of time before the incident inspired a movie adaptation.\n\nPhoenix Forgotten opens with Sophie discovering footage of her brother, who went missing during the Phoenix Lights sighting 20 years ago. Sophie starts analysing the video, hoping to learn the truth about her brother's disappearance.\n\nRather than being a straightforward found-footage feature, Phoenix Forgotten keeps cutting between the unearthed tapes and Sophie's own investigation, which is a great way to amplify the tension. The initial tape ends as the brother discovers a charred corpse, so the audience is desperate for Sophie to uncover the rest of the footage to learn more.\n\nEven though the found-footage angle has been done to death, few films in the genre seem more authentic than Phoenix Forgotten. The scratched frames and analogue defects make the footage look like it originated from a VHS camcorder, making it easier to remain invested in the story."

A local business owner is standing out in a male-dominated space and is helping others save time and money.\n\nAdriana Lacy knows what it\u2019s like to be constantly busy. She runs her own consulting business, teaches at Brandeis University, and launched two apps to help small businesses and content creators.\n\n\u201cA lot of the clients that we have are very small and they definitely don\u2019t have the staff or the resources to have a full communications team,\u201d said Adriana Lacy, Cofounder and CEO of Adriana Lacy Consulting.\n\nWith a small team around herself, Lacy and her employees jumped into the AI world to help add more of what we all want---time and money. Her team created two apps---one, called Social Chime, helps with social media management.\n\n\u201cSo with this app, not only can they manage their social media profiles, but they can also use AI to help them with caption writing AI to help them with generating images, to really just help them increase their workflow.\u201d\n\nWith 4.9 billion people on social media, according to Forbes, businesses are searching for ways to make themselves stand out. Lacy explained how her app worked, including using the AI assistant button to write out a post and within seconds, a caption spits out. She said this helps drive traffic to a site, using minimal time and money. Her other app compiles data from multiple sources and issues daily reports.\n\n\u201cWhat I see with a lot of smaller business owners is they may never, you know, check their sales or their advertising on a daily basis, and they might just be losing out on money or on customers because they\u2019re not staying ahead of this and being able to deliver them,\u201d said Lacy.\n\nLacy says AI can help businesses make more informed decisions, but she\u2019s also focused on the ethical use of AI and double-checking what it spits out.\n\n\u201cEven though it is, you know, machine-controlled machine outputs, these outputs were created by humans,\u201d said Lacy. \u201cSo of course there\u2019s always biases that are baked into these models that can disadvantage people.\u201d\n\nAs a Forbes 30 under 30 honoree, she hopes her influence can break some barriers in the field of AI.\n\n\u201cYou look at some of the biggest AI companies right now, they\u2019re all run by men,\u201d said Lacy. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s a really great time to have more women in the field really thinking and just providing more diverse perspectives.\u201d\n\nLacy created the apps to serve as a lifeline for small businesses that can\u2019t afford social media management tools that cost hundreds of dollars. Her Social Chime and Insight Analytics apps start at $33 a month.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW"

        "article_content": "At first not many were using Google's NotebookLM to take notes. But it's been receiving more attention since it added a feature letting users create an audio summary of files in a conversational, podcast-like format featuring one male and one female voice. Zacharie Scheurer/dpa\n\nA previously little known Google-created AI research and note-taking tool has \u201creally taken off\u201d after it added an audio feature which turned notes into podcast-like audio and the results went viral, one of its product managers has said.\n\nNotebookLM was first released last year as an AI tool to help users interact with their documents \u2013 allowing them to upload a range of files and get summaries and explanations based on that content.\n\nBut the app has begun receiving more mainstream public attention in recent weeks after it added a feature called Audio Overviews, which enabled users to create an audio summary of their upload files, but in a conversational, podcast-like format featuring one male and one female voice.\n\nVarious results from using the tool quickly circulated online and brought new users to the app.\n\nNow Raiza Martin, a product manager at Google Labs and one of the people leading the build of NotebookLM, says users are hungry for more editing control over the type of Audio Overviews they can create with the tool.\n\n\u201cThis is such an exciting time, because since we\u2019ve launched it everyone on Twitter and Reddit and even in our Discord is saying \u2018I want the knobs\u2019, particularly for more voices, or \u2018I want to change the length\u2019,\u201d she told the PA news agency.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to change everything, and we\u2019re definitely going to address this. We\u2019re shipping features quickly to give people more control, but we\u2019re trying to be thoughtful about which controls we ship first.\u201d\n\nAn update to NotebookLM has since rolled out, allowing users to tweak which topics or areas from their source notes they would like covered specifically.\n\nMs Martin added: \u201cI always get asked the question \u2018who is the tool for\u2019 or \u2018who is your target audience?\u2019 and most of the time I\u2019ve thought about it in the same way, which is; what is the person\u2019s profession? How are they applying this to their everyday life?.\n\n\u201cAnd I think we were very, very fortunate in that when we launched Notebook as Project Tailwind last year, we just launched the tool with none of those assumptions to try to find out how people would use it.\u201d\n\nShe said this lack of a specific target audience has helped show that the app could be applicable for anyone who \u201cworks on a computer\u201d, particularly when it came to the audio summaries, and the team building the app were already hearing stories of people listening to the Audio Overviews like a podcast to help them digest their notes.\n\n\u201cSpecifically for the audio, I think one of our key insights is that there are a lot of jobs that require you to digest a lot of information \u2013 and not just jobs \u2013 learners, students of all ages, educators\u2026 basically, if you\u2019re working on a computer, this is the sort of thing you could probably find utility in,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from a lot of people that the way they use it is to listen to the audio first and then write their own questions down, and that had me thinking what a magical harmony between people, technology, information, knowledge, and I think we\u2019re just at the starting line of what this can do.\u201d\n\nNotebookLM has not had the high-profile launch of Google\u2019s flagship AI assistant, Gemini, which powers NotebookLM, but Ms Martin said the newfound fame the note-taking tool had found meant this \u201ctrue experimental product for Google\u201d was getting a more serious product road-map.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ll say in terms of how we\u2019re approaching the continuing rollout is that I think we\u2019ve learned a lot in the last year; what is really resonating with people, what is really useful, how they\u2019re using it every day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that the way we want to keep pushing forward is to really stabilise the experience, and there\u2019s still a lot of work to do to try to connect this to everyday people and make it really relevant.\n\n\u201cSo I think that while the feature work that we\u2019re doing is exciting, I think now is the right time to also start addressing how do we make it so much easier to use.\n\n\u201cBecause for better or worse, that\u2019s not where a lot of our attention has been, but now that we have a lot more interest, a lot more users, let\u2019s make it a lot easier.\u201d"

Did you hear that?\u201d McLean reacts.\n\nIt\u2019s someone working upstairs, mostly likely.\n\nBut maybe not.\n\nPresentation House Theatre is one of the oldest buildings on the North Shore and, according to the Vancouver Paranormal Society, likely one of the most haunted.\n\nResearchers from the society are preparing to share the findings of their investigation into spirits who still dwell in the theatre at a one-night show scheduled for Oct. 29.\n\nGhosts in the machines\n\nLeah McLean and Mike O\u2019Dell of the Vancouver Paranormal Society scan for paranormal activity at North Vancouver\u2019s Presentation House Theatre. The group will present their findings at a one-night show on Oct. 29. | Paul McGrath / North Shore News\n\nSearching for proof of an afterlife here on earth doesn\u2019t involve a s\u00e9ance or a Ouija board. Instead, paranormal researchers prefer more sophisticated tools \u2013 night vision cameras and infrared spectrum lighting, proximity sensors that emit light if something interrupts the electromagnetic field around them, devices that scan radio frequencies for unexplainable interruptions.\n\nThe most important piece of equipment though is a simple digital voice recorder that the investigators say is capable of capturing voices that our naked ears can\u2019t hear. More than passively listening or scanning for activity on their instruments, investigators like McLean speak out to the seemingly empty room and find answers only when they\u2019re analyzing their recordings at home.\n\nAll of it is based on the theory that, even after a person has died, there remains a spirit that is tangible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all made up of energy, right? And that energy of ours is housed in our body, but when we no longer have a body, we\u2019re in a spirit form. We\u2019re just energy,\u201d Kelly Berge, president of the Vancouver Paranormal Society, explains.\n\nRather than attributing every flicker of light or bit of static on the radio to a presence from beyond the dead, they first look for corroborating evidence from their other instruments.\n\nOther times \u2013 rarely \u2013 our own senses are enough to do the job.\n\nBerge said she\u2019s always felt since she was just a kiddo that there was something more beyond the corporeal. As she was peering into her closet one night when she was about 10, she got all the proof she\u2019d need for a lifetime.\n\n\u201cI saw a floating opalescent skull. You know when you do that thing where you rub your eyes and you look again, and it was still there,\u201d she said. \u201cI never slept in that room again, but that experience stuck with me.\u2026 I always knew I wanted to figure this out.\u201d\n\nTypically, at least three or four of the non-profit\u2019s team of 11 volunteers are out every weekend carrying out investigations on behalf of clients who\u2019ve requested them. Importantly, the team never charges a fee of any kind, Berge notes.\n\nMost of their work comes from residential homeowners who want to know what\u2019s making things go bump in the night, but it\u2019s the public buildings with long histories that offer the most promise.\n\nThanks to rumours already swirling about it in the community, Presentation House Theatre had long been near the top of the list of places that the team was itching to get into, Berge said.\n\nPresentation House Theatre\u2019s haunting inhabitants\n\nPresentation House Theatre in North Vancouver. | Alanna Kelly / North Shore News\n\nThe building itself dates back to 1902 when it was built as a school. It later became the City of North Vancouver\u2019s municipal hall, a police station and jail, and offices for the city\u2019s engineering department before finally becoming a museum and arts facility in the 1970s.\n\nAraceli Ferrara, marketing co-ordinator for Presentation House Theatre, said she began hearing about the building\u2019s ghosts on her first day of work, and she\u2019s tagged along with the investigators on all of their visits.\n\nActors have reported feeling a strange presence while backstage. One of the technicians has heard the sound of footsteps sprinting toward him while working alone late at night. Once, after one of his gloves went missing on the job, it turned up the next day folded neatly in the middle of the set. And everyone gets \u201cbad vibes\u201d from the third floor, Ferrara said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely seen a few things,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been here past midnight. I don\u2019t want to be.\u201d\n\nInvestigators have made five official visits to the theatre since 2023, with more planned in the future.\n\n\u201cEvery time we come, we get more and more confirmation that there\u2019s something here. So, we just keep coming back,\u201d said McLean, one of the Paranormal Society\u2019s volunteers.\n\nUntil the recent investigations, the most authoritative source on paranormal activity at Presentation House Theatre was the word of Cecil Halsey, the building\u2019s caretaker for more than 25 years. Halsey, who sometimes slept in the 122-year-old building, was well acquainted with Frank, one of the most frequently encountered spirits there.\n\nBerge said they found plenty of evidence that Frank is still there and that he is \u201ckind of inappropriate.\u201d\n\nHe likes whiskey, they learned, and among the phrases they captured him saying were \u201cbad and beautiful\u201d and \u201cshut up, bitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are usually the same personality in death and spirit as they were in life,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s just being a jerk. He\u2019s being who he was in real life, but he\u2019s not going to harm me. He\u2019s not going to harm the staff.\u2026 It\u2019s not like those TV shows where everything is demonic and all that. That\u2019s extremely, extremely rare.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean though that wayward spirits can\u2019t still send a chill down the spine of even a seasoned paranormal researcher. On their last visit to Presentation House, the batteries in the team\u2019s cameras all died simultaneously and unexpectedly. Moments later, Berge saw an apparition in the very seats where Presentation House\u2019s guests pay to sit.\n\n\u201cI saw a black shadow figure, very stark, crouch down and lean into the aisle chair, and then it was gone,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was something that shouldn\u2019t have been there.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also another spirit of a younger girl on the third floor, according to the team. And it appears as though there's someone new to keep Frank company: the old caretaker Halsey died in 2019, but he identified himself, albeit faintly, to the investigators at the theatre, Berge said.\n\nI ain\u2019t afraid of no ghosts\n\nLeah McLean and Mike O'Dell, investigators with the Vancouver Paranormal Society, listen for activity in North Vancouver's Presentation House Theatre. | Alanna Kelly / North Shore News\n\nWhether it\u2019s in a home or place of business, more than anything after an investigation, clients get some peace of mind, Berge said.\n\n\u201cPeace of mind, and (knowing) they\u2019re not crazy. They weren\u2019t making this up in their heads. They did experience these things, as did we, and that is a huge thing,\u201d she said.\n\nKnowing you have a spirit present is one thing. But ghosts, she added, are not in need of \"busting.\" Instead, some frank communication (no pun intended) is probably what\u2019s most needed \u2013 letting the spirit know that the living inhabitants of today have a right to be there and that everyone can coexist harmoniously.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give the client a tool to be strong and to take their power back in their home. And quite often, when that happens and they\u2019re feeling more settled, the activity tends to settle down a bit,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the things I always say is ghosts are people too. They\u2019re just further along in the journey than we are, but we\u2019re going to be there someday, right? So we have to come with the utmost respect.\u201d\n\nDo you believe?\n\nRunning into skeptics comes with the territory, and Berge acknowledges none of the evidence they\u2019ve collected will be enough to meet some people\u2019s standards. But, she added, those who are committed to their closed-mindedness are robbing themselves of the possibility that there may be something else \u201cout there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t certify it as haunted, because we\u2019re dealing with a science that isn\u2019t recognized by mainstream science, right? So the jury\u2019s still out, because there is no definable proof,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced it over hundreds of investigations, but they still just make up their mind so they\u2019re not open. And that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nAnd more people are closer to believing in the paranormal than might be prepared to admit, suggests Mike O\u2019Dell, another of the Vancouver Paranormal Society's volunteer investigators.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s skeptics out there \u2013 I\u2019m one of them \u2013 and people who don\u2019t believe in this, and that\u2019s fine.\u2026 But for me, it\u2019s when I can\u2019t apply logic or science to something that makes me go \u2018hmm,\u2019 and if I can\u2019t explain something, then that\u2019s the definition of paranormal,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say 99 per cent of the time, it\u2019s just an entity or an energy that wants to be acknowledged, wants to communicate, wants to say \u2018Hi,\u2019 and just wants to live in peace.\u201d\n\nThis is a busy time of year for the Vancouver Paranormal Society. Around Halloween, people are more willing to explore the big questions that ghost stories pose about the nature of mortality. Or they just want to have some good, clean seasonal fun and have the wits scared out of them in the process.\n\n\u201cPeople, especially around Halloween, are very interested in the paranormal. They want to know if it\u2019s true or not. They want to have that little bit of a thrill and some people may have had their own experiences,\u201d Berge said.\n\nBecause of that innate desire to know the unknowable, Ferrara said she expects the Haunted Histories show to be a hit for the true believers, the skeptics and those caught between worlds.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of interest in death. I know it\u2019s macabre, but, because there\u2019s a stigma around it, we don\u2019t talk about it as openly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting to delve into something that you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHaunted Histories: An Evening with the Vancouver Paranormal Society runs Tuesday, Oct. 29, 7:30 p.m. at Presentation House Theatre.

        "article_content": "For the first time, physicists have observed a \u201cblack hole triple\u201d in space. This new system is about 8,000 light years away from Earth and is made up of a central black hole that is in the act of consuming a small star spiraling very close to it. Surprisingly, a second star appears to also be circling the central black hole, but much further away. The discovery is described in a study published October 23 in the journal Nature.\n\nHitting a triple\n\nMost of the black holes that scientists have detected appear to be part of a pair called a binary system. These systems are made up of the black hole and a secondary object like a star, much denser neutron star, or another black hole. The binary system then spirals around each other and are drawn together by the black hole\u2019s gravity.\n\nFor this new black hole triple, there is an additional object orbiting the central black hole. The closer star orbits the black hole about every 6.5 days. The authors estimate that the more far-off companion orbits the black hole every 70,000 years.\n\n[Related: The hunt for the first stars in the universe.]\n\nThat a black hole appears to have a gravitational hold on an object that is so far away is raising some questions about the origins of this black hole itself. Scientists believe that black holes form from a supernova\u2013the violent explosion of a dying star. During a supernova, a star releases a huge amount of energy and light in one final burst before it collapses into an invisible black hole.\n\nIf this newly-observed black hole resulted from a typical supernova, the energy it would have released before it ultimately collapsed would have kicked away any more loosely bound objects orbiting on its outskirts. In theory, that second outer star shouldn\u2019t still be hanging around.\n\nThe team believes that the black hole formed through a more gentle process instead\u2013direct collapse. During direct collapse, a star simply caves in on itself and forms a black hole without that last dramatic burst. A gentle origin like this wouldn\u2019t really disturb any loosely bound, faraway objects.\n\nSince the new triple system includes a very far-off star, the system\u2019s black hole was potentially born through that gentler direct collapse. While astronomers have been observing violent supernovae for centuries, this new triple system may be the first evidence of a black hole that formed from this more gentle process.\n\n\u201cWe think most black holes form from violent explosions of stars, but this discovery helps call that into question,\u201d study co-author and MIT physicist Kevin Burdge said in a statement. \u201cThis system is super exciting for black hole evolution, and it also raises questions of whether there are more triples out there.\u201d\n\nChance discovery\n\nThis discovery also came about almost by chance. The physicists found it while looking through a repository of astronomical observations taken by telescopes in space and around the world called Aladin Lite. They used Aladin Lite to search for images of the same part of the sky, taken by different telescopes tuned to various wavelengths of energy and light.\n\nOriginally, they were looking within the Milky Way galaxy for signs of new black holes. Out of curiosity, Burdge reviewed an image of V404 Cygni, a black hole roughly 8,000 light years from Earth. In 1992, V404 Cygni became one of the very first objects in space to be confirmed as a black. Since then, it has been documented in over 1,300 scientific papers and is one of our most well-studied black holes. However, none of these studies reported this strange triple system.\n\n[Related: 1.5 billion cosmic objects dazzle in the largest infrared Milky Way map ever created.]\n\nWhile looking at optical images of V404 Cygni, Burdge saw what looked like two blobs of light that were close to one another. The first blob was the black hole and an inner star orbiting close by. That star is so close to the hole that it is releasing some of its material onto the black hole itself and giving off visible light. However, that second blob of light was most likely coming from a very distant star that had not been observed before.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we can see two separate stars over this much distance actually means that the stars have to be really very far apart,\u201d said Burdge.\n\nCalculations found that the outer star is 3,500 astronomical units (AU) away from the black hole. One AU is the distance between Earth and the sun. The outer star is thus 3,500 times further away from the black hole as we are to the sun, or 100 times greater than the distance between Pluto and the sun.\n\nThe team then questioned whether the outer star was linked to both the black hole and its inner star. To find an answer, the team looked to Gaia, the satellite that has been tracking the motions of all the stars in the galaxy for a decade. They analyzed the motions of the inner and outer stars over the past 10 years of Gaia data and found that the stars moved in tandem compared to some of the nearby stars. According to their calculations, the odds of this kind of tandem motion are about one in 10 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly not a coincidence or accident,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing two stars that are following each other because they\u2019re attached by this weak string of gravity. So this has to be a triple system.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s go fly a (space) kite\n\nThe team then wondered how this system could have formed in the first place. The violent explosion of a typical supernova would have kicked that outstar away a very long time ago.\n\n\u201cImagine you\u2019re pulling a kite, and instead of a strong string, you\u2019re pulling with a spider web,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cIf you tugged too hard, the web would break and you\u2019d lose the kite. Gravity is like this barely bound string that\u2019s really weak, and if you do anything dramatic to the inner binary, you\u2019re going to lose the outer star.\u201d\n\nTo test out this kite string theory, Burdge carried out computer simulations to see how this kind of triple system could have evolved and kept the outer star.\n\n[Related: Biggest black hole jets ever seen span 140 Milky Way galaxies.]\n\nAt the beginning of each simulation, he introduced three stars. The third star was the black hole, before it became a black hole. He then ran tens of thousands of simulations. Each simulation had a slightly different scenario for how the third star may have become a black hole and affected the motions of the other two stars. For example, he simulated a supernova and changed the amount of energy and the direction all of that energy traveled in. He also simulated scenarios of direct collapse, where the third star caved in on itself to form a black hole, without sending off any energy.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of simulations show that the easiest way to make this triple work is through direct collapse,\u201d Burdge says.\n\nThis extra outer star also revealed the system\u2019s age. The team observed that the outer star is in the process of becoming a red giant, a phase occurring at the end of a star\u2019s life. They believe that the outerstar is about 4 billion years old, based on this transition. Since the neighboring stars are born around the same time, the team believes that this black hole triple is also 4 billion years old.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been able to do this before for an old black hole,\u201d Burdge said. \u201cNow we know V404 Cygni is part of a triple, it could have formed from direct collapse, and it formed about 4 billion years ago, thanks to this discovery.\u201d"

Automation offers a solution. Robotic systems can perform experiments continuously without human fatigue, significantly speeding up research. Robots not only execute precise experimental steps with greater consistency than humans, they also reduce safety risks by handling hazardous substances. By automating routine tasks, scientists can focus on higher-level research questions, paving the way for faster breakthroughs in medicine, energy and sustainability.\n\n\"Robotics has the potential to turn our everyday science labs into automated 'factories' that accelerate discovery, but to do this, we need creative solutions to allow researchers and robots to collaborate in the same lab environment,\" said Dr. James Cahoon, a co-author of the paper and chair of the Department of Chemistry. \"With continued development, we expect robotics and automation will improve the speed, precision and reproducibility of experiments across diverse instruments and disciplines, generating the data that artificial intelligence systems can analyze to guide further experimentation.\"\n\nThe researchers defined five levels of laboratory automation to illustrate how automation can evolve in science labs:\n\nAssistive Automation (A1): At this level, individual tasks, such as liquid handling, are automated while humans handle the majority of the work.\n\nPartial Automation (A2): Robots perform multiple sequential steps, with humans responsible for setup and supervision.\n\nConditional Automation (A3): Robots manage entire experimental processes, though human intervention is required when unexpected events arise.\n\nHigh Automation (A4): Robots execute experiments independently, setting up equipment and reacting to unusual conditions autonomously.\n\nFull Automation (A5): At this final stage, robots and AI systems operate with complete autonomy, including self-maintenance and safety management.\n\nThe levels of automation defined by the researchers can be used to assess progress in the field, help in establishing appropriate safety protocols and set goals for future research in both science domains and robotics. Although lower levels of automation are common today, achieving high and full automation is a research challenge that will require robots capable of operating across different lab environments, handling complex tasks and interacting with humans and other automation systems seamlessly.\n\nArtificial intelligence plays a key role in advancing automation beyond physical tasks. AI can analyze vast datasets generated by experiments, identify patterns and suggest new compounds or research directions. Integrating AI into the laboratory workflow will allow labs to automate the entire research cycle\u2014from designing experiments to synthesizing materials and analyzing results.\n\nIn AI-driven labs, the traditional Design-Make-Test-Analyze (DMTA) loop can become fully autonomous. AI could determine which experiments to conduct, make real-time adjustments, and continuously improve the research process. While AI systems have shown early success in tasks like predicting chemical reactions and optimizing synthesis routes, the researchers caution that AI must be carefully monitored to avoid risks, such as the accidental creation of hazardous materials.\n\nTransitioning to automated labs presents significant technical and logistical challenges. Laboratories differ widely in their setups, ranging from single-process labs to large, multiroom facilities. Developing flexible automation systems that work across diverse environments will require mobile robots capable of transporting items and performing tasks across multiple stations.\n\nTraining scientists to work with advanced automation systems is equally important. Researchers will not only need to develop expertise in their scientific fields but also understand the capabilities of robots, data science and AI to accelerate their research. Educating the next generation of scientists to collaborate with engineers and computer scientists will be essential for realizing the full potential of automated laboratories.\n\n\"The integration of robotics and AI is poised to revolutionize science labs,\" said Angelos Angelopoulos, a co-author of the paper and research assistant in Dr. Alterovitz's Computational Robotics Group. \"By automating routine tasks and accelerating experimentation, there is great potential for creating an environment where breakthroughs occur faster, safer and more reliably than ever before.\"\n\nThe research paper is available online in the journal Science Robotics at: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adm6991"

        "article_content": "Clinical trials for drug development are becoming increasingly complex, with numerous variables that must be identified and defined from the start. This complexity arises from rigorous study design, evolving regulatory requirements, diverse patient populations, and the significant time to conduct trials.\n\nTo address these growing challenges, biotech and pharma companies often choose between commercial simulation tools and open-source software. However, an alternate approach leveraging both commercial and open-source software can mitigate risk, transform drug development, and accelerate time to market.\n\nOpen source in pharma\n\nTo fully understand the potential of combining commercial and open-source tools, we must first explore the growing role that open source is playing in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nSince the introduction of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) in the late 1990s, statisticians have increasingly embraced the opportunity to contribute to and utilise open-source software. This is evident from the gradual shift from SAS software to the open-source R programming language.\n\nThe collaborative spirit of the open source movement, first established in the tech world, is now increasingly influencing the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. There has already been a notable shift towards open source in drug discovery and development, including initiatives like the Open Source Pharma Foundation, which advocates for open source approaches to pharmaceutical research and development.\n\nA key advantage of open source is its potential to facilitate rapid innovation. Developers and researchers from diverse backgrounds can quickly evaluate and validate new algorithms. Additionally, by democratising access to advanced tools, open-source software enables smaller biotech companies and academic researchers to participate in novel drug development and contribute to an innovative ecosystem.\n\nHowever, adopting open-source tools in drug development has brought several challenges. These include:\n\n1. Lack of industry support and documentation \u2013 Open-source tools often lack the extensive support and comprehensive documentation that commercial tools offer. This often leads to a steep learning curve and a higher barrier to entry.\n\n2. Concerns about reliability and validity \u2013 Without the rigorous testing and validation that commercial tools undergo, reliability can become a concern. Though many open- source software packages include extensive testing, there is no guarantee that this will persist over time. The challenge is exacerbated by the need to meet regulatory standards, as well as the long timelines that are inherent in drug development.\n\n3. Unclear financial incentives \u2013 The lack of clear commercial incentives can limit the ongoing development and support of open-source tools. This can also create conflicting incentives for developers and pharmaceutical companies, sometimes discouraging commercial software development due to the availability of limited open-source alternatives.\n\nA hybrid approach to drug discovery\n\nDrug developers can overcome these challenges by adopting successful hybrid approaches taken from the tech industry.\n\nIn cloud computing and AI, combining open-source components with commercial solutions has proven highly effective. Companies like Google, Amazon, and IBM have seamlessly integrated third-party open-source tools such as Apache Kafka and PostgreSQL into their enterprise offerings. These frameworks bring innovative, community-driven development to commercial platforms that ensure enterprise-grade reliability, user support, and regulatory compliance.\n\nPharma is beginning to adopt similar strategies. A notable example is AlphaFold, the open-source protein structure prediction tool developed by DeepMind. While AlphaFold\u2019s core model is freely available, companies like Schr\u00f6dinger have enhanced its utility by integrating it into their commercial drug discovery platforms.\n\nThese platforms combine AlphaFold\u2019s predictive power with proprietary algorithms for virtual screening, molecular dynamics, and lead optimisation, providing pharma companies with powerful, regulatory-compliant environments for drug discovery.\n\nBy blending the strengths of open source innovation with the reliability and scalability of commercial solutions, companies can streamline drug discovery and bring new therapies to market more quickly.\n\nClinical trial design\n\nWhile there are currently few examples of clinical trial software utilising a hybrid approach, the potential is significant. Open source R packages like multiarm for adaptive trial design could be integrated into commercial platforms that offer user-friendly interfaces, visualisation tools, and regulatory compliance features.\n\nSuch integration could enhance simulation and optimisation by leveraging cloud computing, leading to faster response times and improved trial designs. By merging open source insights with commercial optimisation tools, pharma and biotech companies can accelerate the development of novel solutions for more efficient and effective drug development.\n\nThe future of drug development\n\nAs we look to the future, the most effective clinical trial designs will undoubtedly arise from a hybrid approach, integrating the strengths of both commercial platforms and open-source software.\n\nHowever, the success of this approach will rely on strong collaboration between commercial entities and the open source community. By fostering partnerships and ensuring compatibility, both sectors can drive innovation and create more effective tools for drug development.\n\nBy leveraging open-source tools, hybrid approaches can also help reduce the overall cost of drug development, making it more affordable and potentially accelerating the time to market. This cost reduction could translate into greater accessibility to new therapies for patients worldwide.\n\nSuch an approach not only enhances efficiency and innovation, but also ensures that clinical trials are conducted with the highest standards of ethical and scientific rigour. As the pharma and biotech industries continue to explore and adopt hybrid models, we have the opportunity to significantly benefit patients and advance drug development."

The figure by itself may not speak volumes about the maturity of the Indian tech and startup ecosystem, but it does highlight the road taken to get there and the role played by Indian angel investors, global venture capital giants and hundreds of family offices backing Indian startups.\n\nWhile hundreds of billions of dollars have been pumped into startups to get them to the point of maturity, many of these stakeholders believe it\u2019s time for the next leg of the journey.\n\nThe maturity of the Indian startup ecosystem is playing out in terms of exits through IPOs or secondary sales or M&As, but what about backing the next generation of startups?\n\nWhat often goes under the radar is that most of these exits and returns have gone to foreign investors. The share of domestic investment in India is estimated to be less than 15% over the past decade.\n\nHow keen are Indian investors \u2014 angels and family offices \u2014 to join the next wave? And in particular, are family offices the key to unlocking the domestic capital vault in India?\n\nBehind The Family Office Wave In India\n\n\n\nConcerns around foreign capital dominating the Indian market have lingered for years. We have seen founders and Indian fund managers bemoan the lack of domestic investor participation.\n\nBut the trigger point came around the end of 2022 when startups realised that foreign VCs were tightening their purses, and the current phase of growth for Indian startups depends on Indian investors. With this foundation laid down, VC firms and fund managers are looking to tap that all-important domestic investor pool for their fundraising.\n\nRecent market trends, particularly around growth expectations and bloated valuations, have highlighted the importance of having domestic investors who know the Indian market and its peculiar challenges, particularly around profits and scaling up.\n\nDomestic investors have learned valuable lessons from the period of FOMO investing and the \u201cspray-and-pray\u201d approach of 2020 and 2021, and now, there\u2019s a lot more focus on value than valuation. Instances of governance lapses at unicorns have also led to some fears about a startup bubble. But fund managers claim domestic family offices and limited partners are more diligent at times because of how well they know the market.\n\nFamily offices are also realising that startups need patient capital and that they are best suited to deploy such capital, as they are more familiar with the ground reality, according to fund managers and multi-family office managers.\n\n\u201cSo many foreign VCs are now realising that the Indian market does not have the depth for large deals, especially in deeptech. We are not creating an OpenAI or Anthropic yet, so founders need to seek investors that don\u2019t bring the pressure of growing like OpenAI,\u201d according to the family office manager for a Delhi NCR-based real estate giant.\n\nTech giants in the US and China took advantage of access to patient domestic investors who were willing to make long-term bets on new and disruptive ventures. In India, a similar shift is underway, and it\u2019s vital for domestic capital to actively participate in this transformation to nurture homegrown innovation and create globally competitive companies.\n\nIndia\u2019s Patient Capital Pool\n\nStartups, especially those led by founders from Tier II and Tier III towns, are increasingly looking to HNIs and family offices helmed by seasoned industrialists and entrepreneurs for funding. Unlike foreign investors, who might be focussed on achieving quick returns, domestic investors often have a more nuanced understanding of the local market and are better positioned to provide patient capital for this very reason.\n\nThis type of capital is crucial because it allows startups to grow sustainably without the immediate pressure of delivering rapid returns. Domestic investors bring the added advantage of regional market insights and experience, enabling them to offer more than just financial backing\u2014they can offer strategic support as well.\n\nGaurav VK Singhvi, the founder of We Founder Circle and SEBI-registered Avinya Ventures, believes India needs a robust base of domestic investors, even those with a lower appetite for investing than global VC giants. Startups are seeing that large cheques come with pressure to grow and scale in a manner that the Indian market does not allow.\n\nSinghvi added that the startup playbooks backed by foreign capital are now mature enough to be scaled up with domestic money. \u201cFamily offices are the true patient capital, and if we have to change the direction of Indian tech from established and mature sectors to emerging sectors, we need this patient capital. And the best way to attract more family offices is to have an established track record as a fund manager,\u201d he told Inc42.\n\nIn this regard, Singhvi\u2019s background as the founder of We Founder Circle as well as his record of exits as an angel investor have proven to be key propositions to attract family offices. Singhvi pointed out that with exits from the likes of BharatPe (80x returns), Rooter (32X returns), Zypp Electric (28x returns) and Coutloot (22x returns), many family offices are convinced that he is able to find the right deals.\n\nHowever, bringing family offices on board for funds investing in emerging and new frontier technology is easier said than done.\n\nHow HNIs Are Testing The Waters\n\nWaterfield Advisors\u2019 managing director Rohan Paranjpey believes family offices in India are fortunately seeing the right indicators in many of the new AIFs launched in the past year. Fund managers are coming with unique insights and a track record that makes it easier for family offices to invest in funds. Family offices began their startup investments as a hobby, with smaller cheques of around INR 10 to 50 Lakh and limited fund allocations of 2% to 5%. But they are maturing fast.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing in Tier II, III and IV that family offices are being created, which we had never heard of before. They are excited to invest in startups, but the first cheque may not be that large. Only when they are aligned more with the startup\u2019s model, they are ready to invest more,\u201d he added.\n\nThe focus was on testing the waters rather than making major commitments.\n\nAccording to Sreepriya NS, cofounder and director of Entrust Family Office, a multi-family office manager and advisory, there is reticence among older generations of industrialists and HNIs when it comes to such investments. However, millennial and generation Z members of a family office may want to allocate a small portion of the portfolio to such areas and sectors.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a generational shift happening in some of the older family offices. We are seeing the move from public markets to private investments, and younger HNIs are definitely more keen to explore areas like deeptech or AI today. This may not have been the case even five to six years ago,\u201d Entrust\u2019s Sreepriya told Inc42.\n\nToday, family offices typically invest in startups through VC or angel funds, relying on these funds\u2019 reputations. However, when they co-invest or invest directly, it gives them a chance to showcase their business expertise and build their own presence in the startup world.\n\nEven so, founders often prefer to raise from established VC funds or angel funds rather than family offices, due to the perceived brand value of having such a name on their cap table. In some sectors such as insurance, having domestic investors is crucial, so these are sectors where family offices have an advantage over foreign VCs.\n\nWhy Multi-Family Offices Are Booming\n\nOf course, running a family office is not unlike running a fund. They need the talent and the structure of an institutional fund. Often, this means hiring lawyers for various deals, getting chartered accountants to vet deals and statements, having a roadmap for the next generation in the family and so on.\n\nThis is where multi-family office managers and advisors come into play. Multi-family offices such as Entrust, Cervin Family Office, Legacy Growth, Waterfield Advisors and others are looking to become the pillars for horizontal aspects of running a family office.\n\nEntrust\u2019s Sreepriya believes that when it comes to cost, expertise in investments, legal compliances, estate planning and indeed rifts within the family, multi-family offices can be a godsend for HNIs looking to set up a formal investment portfolio.\n\n\u201cFor family offices to successfully invest in startups, they need to build professional teams, set clear objectives, and deal with significant annual expenses, which can eat up a lot of their corpus. Sometimes you may need multiple lawyers for various kinds of deals, and other times, you may need to educate the next generation on how to go about investing,\u201d she added.\n\nSharan Asher who runs Eragon Ventures, the family office for the former promoters of J.B. Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, points out another challenge: managing family offices isn\u2019t yet seen as a serious career option among fund managers. But having a multi-family office means the HNI family can bank on those with expertise and credentials in investment advisory.\n\nOne cannot understate the significance of IPOs and the public markets in swaying the domestic LPs and investor base towards the startup ecosystem.\n\nIn particular, the massive gains for stocks such as Zomato, TBO Tek, Policybazaar, Honasa and RateGain in the past year, as well as the boom in the SME IPO market have turned heads. It\u2019s not just about the large brand names but also smaller promising IPOs, and with the likes of Swiggy entering public markets soon, startups and funds are likely to see more domestic HNIs and family offices queuing up to back them.\n\nDomestic family offices and investors are more than familiar with the dynamics of public markets \u2014 some of the promoters behind these offices lead public companies themselves. For these investors, the IPO-led exit momentum is a massive validation of the maturity of the new-age tech and startup ecosystem.\n\nAnd it\u2019s creating a virtuous cycle where each wave of successful listing brings gains and attracts more family offices to the investor pool. No wonder then that there\u2019s a lot of optimism around India\u2019s domestic capital finally showing its true colours."

Antivirus, ransomware protection, malware blocking, and more are available in free and paid subscription plans.\n\nA few months ago, I reviewed Avast One for Windows and found it to be a good solution. However, the Mac is a very different computer with unique hardware and software, so I tested Avast One for Mac to find out if it\u2019s a good fit for Apple\u2019s system and one of the best antivirus apps for your Mac.\n\nSpecs\n\nAvast One Platforms Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android Devices 5 (individual), 30 (family) Support Chat, email Price $180 Free version? Yes\n\nTiers and pricing\n\nAvast One\u2019s website describes its free tier as Basic, but the documentation refers to it as Avast One Essential. Either way, it\u2019s powerful antivirus software that protects your Mac for free. You get a malware scanner and browser protection to block malicious downloads. A free VPN is included but the monthly data is restricted to 5GB. Avast One offers one of the best free Mac antivirus apps available.\n\nIf you subscribe, more features are unlocked, and you can pick from three price tiers and a few variations. Avast One Silver starts at $36 annually with a choice of more protection, privacy, or performance features. Renewal costs are significantly higher than the first year, jumping to $80 in year two and beyond. You can get all three feature packs at once with the $60 Avast One Gold ($130 renewal).\n\nAvast One comes in family plans as well. For $84/$180, Avast One Silver Family increases the number of supported devices from the standard five to a generous 30, enough for everyone to enjoy protection. Avast One Gold Family costs $114/$280 to cover 30 devices.\n\nThe top tier is Avast One Platinum for $120/$300, a relatively minor increase from Avast One Gold Family that adds identity protection, dark web monitoring, and $2 million in identity theft insurance.\n\nDesign\n\nInstalling Avast One was simple, and much easier than my experience with McAfee\u2019s antivirus for Mac. After downloading the installer, a Finder window opened with a message to double-click it. After agreeing to the terms of use and allowing the required permissions, the installer placed itself in the trash and launched Avast One for setup.\n\nI started with the free version, Avast One Essential, initially skipping the sign-in option. The app guided me to enable Avast access in System Settings, opening the appropriate tabs along the way. After a few clicks, everything was ready in about a minute.\n\nI got a friendly message saying \u201cEverything looks good,\u201d but lacking enough details to convince me. I scrolled down to the shortcuts and found an option to run a system scan. The app updated its virus data, checked my browser caches, and scanned for malware. In the final step, it suggested file cleanup, giving me an option to upgrade to use this feature. I declined and moved to the next shortcut, the VPN.\n\nAfter allowing a pop-up approval request from macOS, the free VPN was switched on. It\u2019s capped at 5GB per month, which isn\u2019t enough for daily use, but could be useful for occasional checks or vacation planning.\n\nThe free app shows all the features in the explore tab, but some are locked until I subscribe. Still, plenty are available in Avast One Essential. The system scan checks for malware and includes a VPN, which is capped at 5GB per month.\n\nThe account tab shows my subscription level \u2014 currently none \u2014 and has subsections to set preferences, browse help documents, check the community forums, get support, or uninstall the app. It\u2019s refreshing to see an easy way to uninstall since removing antivirus software is sometimes difficult.\n\nFeatures\n\nAvast for Mac enjoys a near-perfect malware protection record in ongoing evaluations from the independent security research lab AV-Test. In fact, there were only two instances when Avast fell below a perfect six out of six.\n\nIn September 2020, a minor miss dropped AV-Test\u2019s rating to 5.5. The more notable flaw was from six years ago when Avast for Mac failed in 3.7% of the 241 malware tests performed in December 2018.\n\nEvery other quarterly test since December 2017 has been perfect. That\u2019s an impressive protection record that\u2018s almost as good as market leaders Bitdefender and Norton.\n\nWhile I trust AV-Test\u2019s results, I still wanted to spot-check for myself. I visited Wicar\u2019s malware test website to see how good the free web blocker was. Avast One Essential recognized all 13 browser exploits and malware downloads, blocking the danger at every turn.\n\nI tried again with the VPN switched off, and each threat was blocked without using any monthly data to safeguard my browsing. The free app is very good, a generous gift to the often overlooked Mac community.\n\nSwitching the VPN back on, I loaded BrowserLeaks website to check if my IP address was visible. The IP address and location shown were different from mine, so Avast\u2019s free VPN did its job.\n\nWith my Avast One Essential testing complete, I upgraded to Avast One Gold to continue with the subscriber version. That removed all locks on the explore tab, so I used the disk cleaner to free up over 4GB of app caches, trash, and log files.\n\nThere are plenty of extras that help with privacy, protection, and cleaning my Mac. The most important paid features are the uncapped VPN with an option to choose a server in another country to avoid geoblocking and live chat support.\n\nSupport\n\nAs an Avast One Gold subscriber, I requested priority support on the website via live chat. At first, I got a chatbot that misunderstood my question about how Avast One works. A multiple-choice selection let me switch to a live agent who immediately took over. After being speedy at first, the second response was much slower, and I had to repeat what I told the chatbot.\n\nIt was a bit frustrating, as if the agent didn\u2019t understand my question. I asked for another agent but they tried again to answer. After my second request to transfer, I was told to hold.\n\nUnfortunately, no one else was available, so I tried simplifying my question. That worked, and I got the answer I expected \u2014 Avast One protects my browser from malware and also scans my computer. I also asked some VPN questions and received prompt and accurate replies.\n\nAfter 15 minutes, suddenly the answers came quickly and with higher quality. I suspect the misunderstanding was a side effect of trying to help too many customers at once. That\u2019s the nature of live support, and it will always vary.\n\nOverall, I was satisfied with Avast\u2019s support via live chat.\n\nPrivacy and security\n\nAccording to Avast\u2019s privacy policy, Avast One\u2019s free app might show targeted ads. In my brief test, I didn\u2019t see any, but I quickly switched to a paid plan to complete the review.\n\nThe end-user license agreement allows Avast to send you promotional offers to upgrade to a higher-priced subscription. After three months on Avast\u2019s mailing list, I haven\u2019t noticed many emails, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to be concerned about.\n\nHowever, Avast has had some privacy issues in the past. Google removed the Avast browser extension in 2019 for spying on Chrome users.\n\nAfter five years of behaving kindly, Avast has well-rated security extensions in the Chrome Web Store. I think it\u2019s safe to let those worries fade away.\n\nAvast One protects your Mac and MacBook\n\nIf you like the sound of Avast One\u2019s subscription plans but want to save money, check our guide to the best antivirus deals. Sometimes Avast has sales that cut first-year costs even lower. Still, the costs will skyrocket to more than double the first year when it\u2019s time to renew.\n\nAvast\u2019s parent company, Gen Digital, also owns Norton Security. Norton 360 for Mac has a better subscription package at lower prices, so that\u2019s a better choice if you\u2019re paying for protection.\n\nAvast One Basic (Essential) is a nice, free antivirus that could provide everything you need. It includes prevention and protection just as powerful as what\u2019s in the paid version. If you want more, our guide to the best antivirus software breaks down features and costs to help you make an informed purchase."
