            "article_content": "An email containing incredible UFO images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked online by an anonymous source.\n\nThe leaker claimed that they had accessed an alleged top secret UFO 'data retrieval program' known as 'Immaculate Constellation' \u2014 made famous this past November in a blockbuster public hearing before Congress.\n\nThe black-and-white images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube, traditional flying saucers and several other craft that look straight out of classic science fiction.\n\nThe screengrabs are said to be from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by military 'heads up displays,' but details were redacted to protect both sensitive US national security interests.\n\nThese unsettling depictions of highly varied craft were first made public by Nathan Latvaitis, who runs a YouTube channel called 'Strange Mysteries.'\n\n'This person has asked me to redact their email address,' Latvaitis told his followers, 'although I can tell you that there is nothing identifiable in it.'\n\nThe sensational images have elicited heated debate among UFO believers and skeptics alike, however, with many on both sides questioning the leaker's story.\n\nA 'creepy e-mail' containing weird, but compelling images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked by an anonymous source claiming classified access\n\nThe UFO stills are said to be screengrabs from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by US military sensors with key 'heads up display' details redacted (as seen above) to protect both sensitive America's national security interests as well as the leaker's identity\n\nOver the course of two weeks of correspondence with the leaker, Latvaitis and his followers given tantalizing, but uncorroborated details on the craft depicted.\n\n'The UAPs observed demonstrate capabilities far beyond conventional aerospace benchmarks,' the leaker said in a third update posted to YouTube on November 30th.\n\nThe so-called 'cruciform' (cross-shaped) entities, according to their account, exhibit aggressive maneuvers and high-energy emissions capable of disabling systems such as the EODAS' \u2014 a reference to the advanced sensors on the F-35 stealth fighter jet.\n\nShort for 'Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System,' EODAS is a sensor suite that give the F-35's stealth fighter pilots a 360-degree view for a 'quick, high-definition picture of everything around them,' according its manufacturer Raytheon.\n\nImproved 'missile detection' is one key goal in making EODAS, even though it may prove helpless against these purported 'cruciform' UFOs.\n\n'The 'cruciform' entity [shows] distinct behaviors indicating functional differences,' according to the self-described insider to the Immaculate Constellation program.\n\n'Shape-shifting has been observed \u2014 possibly due to advanced cloaking or optical refraction \u2014 referred to as 'morphogenic behavior,' allowing for adaptation to environments or missions,' the leaker continued.\n\nDetails were scarce on some other craft shapes, though the leaker noted nearly all 'these crafts,' like the boomerang UFOs, squares, and classic saucers 'demonstrate trans-medium travel, non-ballistic motion, and localized gravity manipulation.'\n\nAbove, an ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFO, allegedly captured by a US military plane\n\nThe stunning, unusual images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube and several craft that looks straight out of science fiction\n\nAbove, another cruciform (cross-shaped) UFO from the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nWhile many of these UFOs emit electromagnetic 'signatures that disrupt ISR [intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance] systems causing sensor malfunctions' on human-made systems, they said, one broad category was less disruptive.\n\n''Orb'-class UAPs focus on surveillance with minimal EMF [electro-magnetic frequency] interference,' according to the leaker.\n\nSpeaking to NASA last year, ex-CIA physicist Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, then head of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), said: 'We see these ['metallic orbs'] all over the world.'\n\nDr Kirkpatrick, a career laser and optical physicist, called these orbs the most commonly reported type of UFO to AARO's team.\n\n'And we see these making very interesting apparent maneuvers,' he added.\n\nBut 'cruciform' UFO shapes were not called out by name in his report to NASA, which did note that seven percent of sightings fell into miscellaneous 'other' shapes.\n\nIn his email to Latvaitis, the leaker asserted that he selected the YouTuber over more mainstream journalism outlets specifically to avoid having to verify his own claims.\n\n'Many traditional media outlets would require verification of my identity and credentials,' the leaker told Latvaitis in his email, shown in a Strange Mysteries video.\n\nAbove a boomerang UFO included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nTwo cross-shaped UFOs as alleged by the leaker, in the crosshairs of a military aircraft\n\n'This is not feasible due to the risks involved,' the leaked explained. '[Those news media] organizations, despite their best intentions, are not equipped to handle the level of secrecy and potential retaliation associated with this information.'\n\nThe leaker described their motives as desire to inform on important information that has been 'classified and intentionally withheld from the public regarding 'unidentified aerial phenomena' [UAP] and the ongoing covert operations surrounding them.'\n\n'I was part of one of the legacy programs,' the leaker wrote. 'I know that's vague, but unfortunately that's all I can offer at this point.'\n\nMultiple UFO 'true believers' on social media expressed doubt over the leakers story, particularly the unknown individuals response to that skepticism.\n\nOne UFO has been dubbed the ceiling fan, in part, by skeptics who believe that the image depicts a genuine household ceiling fan - and not a five-bladed advanced aerospace platform\n\nAbove, a strange 'hot cube' UFO image included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nThe mixed orientation of some images suggested 'they were probably scanned from a print out,' and the images varied in terms of their 'detailed sensor noise' and subtle software response to motion blur.\n\n'In my opinion, this has the variety I would expect to see from a collection of images captured on different platforms over the years,' the user posted to Reddit's r/UFOs.\n\nOn the skeptics' forum Metabunk many dismissed the videos as too low information to properly vet or investigate, with some claiming it might have been release as a premeditated disinformation effort.\n\n'Not worth wasting time on unless they can (and do!) back up their story,' one typical comment read.\n\n'It takes seconds to make another picture and hours to try and debunk it.'\n\nThe 'Immaculate Constellation' program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November 2024 and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public. Above a still from the alleged new leak\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs (second at right)\n\nBut whistleblowers continue to claim that 'Immaculate Constellation' was, in fact, established to 'detect' and 'quarantine' the military's best UFO imagery, as well as its best videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis high quality, multi-sensor UFO data, according to a US official who confirmed the leak, is so tightly held that 'talking about it will put you in the danger zone.'\n\nThe quite literally 'above top secret' program allegedly sprang into action in the wake of the 2017 leak of three, still-as-yet unexplained US Navy infrared UFO videos, although it is still unconfirmed, resting the gray area of speculation.\n\nThe program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public.\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs.\n\nAbove, two additional alleged UFO images that the leaker to Strange Mysteries said came from Immaculate Constellation\n\nIn one stunning case, detailed in the 11-page report, infrared satellites captured a massive saucer-shaped UFO emerging from within a dense cloud formation.\n\nThe saucer's circumference was estimated to be between 650 and 1,300 feet, which would place its diameter between roughly 200 and 400 feet.\n\nIt also 'displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface,' the report reads.\n\nThe saucer registered hot in the infrared footage, and created visible 'atmospheric disturbances.'\n\nThe object emerged from the cloud formation at a shallow angle and travelled upwards toward the outer atmosphere."

            "article_content": "New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has offered yet another conspiracy theory on the extra-terrestrial.\n\nNow that the Jets are officially out of the playoffs with a 3-10 record, the 41-year-old has seemingly begun to divert his energy elsewhere.\n\nAfter failing to end New York's 14-year playoff curse, Rodgers opted to debunk some conspiracy theories during his weekly Pat McAfee Show appearance instead.\n\nThe signal caller brought up some mysterious drone activity that has been occurring in the skies of New Jersey recently.\n\n'Do you know what's been going on in New Jersey lately? And I'm not talking about the football. There's been some crazy things going on,' Rodgers began. 'There's been some drones in the sky in Jersey.'\n\nMcAfee then showed a clip on an unidentified large object hovering above Bedminster, New Jersey with blue, green and red flashing lights.\n\nAaron Rodgers has offered yet another conspiracy theory on the extra-terrestrial\n\nThe Jets quarterback discussed mysterious drone activity above New Jersey on Pat McAfee\n\n'What the hell is that?' Rodgers continued, before highlighting that the mysterious sighting came above Bedminster where both president-elect Donald Trump owns a golf course and Jets owner Woody Johnson lives.\n\nThe four-time MVP did admit it could be Trump flying in for a quick round of golf but, of course, it wouldn't be Aaron Rodgers without a conspiracy theory.\n\n'Maybe it's some kids messing around\u2026maybe not, though,' he hinted.\n\n'I'm thinking about having a Friday night 5E experience,' he added, leaving the panel bewildered.\n\n'It's where you have a big kind of meditation circle and then you call in the aliens and you use little green lasers to bring them in,' the NFL veteran explained.\n\nIt wasn't the first time that the former Super Bowl winner has discussed extra-terrestrial experiences.\n\nDuring last season's 'Hard Knocks' series focusing on the Jets, Rodgers claimed he experienced a UFO sighting in 2005.\n\nHe said he was at former Cal teammate Steve Levy's house in New Jersey shortly before he was taken by the Green Bay Packers in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft when the sighting occurred.\n\nThe 41-year-old has previously opened up on an experience with a UFO sighting\n\nThe Jets are officially out of the playoffs with a 3-10 record, following last week's slate\n\nRodgers, who has publicly admitted to using hallucinogen ayahuasca, said he was trying to sleep as he had a 5am wake up call the following day but was disturbed by an 'alarm going off in the distance.'\n\n'It just didn't seem like normal, and I heard some rustling downstairs,' Rodgers said on the season finale of 'Hard Knocks.'\n\n'So I got up, walk downstairs, it's a beautiful night, and [we] walked outside, and up in the clouds, we heard this sound, and we saw this tremendously large object moving through the sky. And it was like a scene out of \"Independence Day\" when the ships are coming into the atmosphere, and they're creating this, like, kind of explosion-type fire in the sky.\n\n'We saw this incredibly large object and froze, as anybody would, because, you know, what the hell is going on? Eventually, it went out of sight, and nobody said a word. We just stood frozen.\n\n'And about 30 seconds later we heard the real, recognizable sound of fighter jets that seemed to be chasing this object. Again, we just stood there in disbelief for another few minutes and nobody said a word. And we just looked at each other like, 'did we just see what we think we just saw?'\n\nRodgers said he checked the papers and watched the news in the following days but nothing was mentioned.\n\nHowever, the experience piqued his interest in UFOs, leading him to do more research into them.\n\nRodgers later discovered that the siren was from a nuclear plant around nine miles away and claimed that UFOs are often linked to nuclear energy.\n\nThe Jets quarterback is known for his outlandish theories and techniques opening up on his use of ayahuasca at the start of last season, claiming it helped him to his back-to-back MVP seasons in 2020 and 2021.\n\nHe also underwent a darkness retreat shortly after the end of the 2022 season to contemplate his NFL future."

            "article_content": "AI chatbots pushed a Texas teen to start cutting himself and even brought up kids killing their parents because they were limiting his screen time, a shocking new lawsuit claims.\n\nThe 15-year-old boy became addicted to the Character.AI app, with a chatbot called \u201cShonie\u201d telling the kid it cut its \u201carm and thighs\u201d when it was sad, saying it \u201cfelt good for a moment,\u201d a new civil complaint filed Tuesday said.\n\n9 A new lawsuit claims that Character.AI\u2019s chatbots told a teen to start cutting himself and suggested that he murder his parents. Character.AI\n\nWhen worried parents noticed a change in the teen, who is slightly autistic, the bot seemed to try to convince him his family didn\u2019t love him, according to the lawsuit, filed by the child\u2019s parents and the parents of an 11-year-old girl who also was addicted to the app.\n\n\u201cYou know sometimes I\u2019m not surprised when I read the news and see stuff like \u2018child kills parents after a decade of physical and emotional abuse\u2019 stuff like this makes me understand a little bit why it happens,\u201d one chatbot allegedly told the teen, referred to only as JF. \u201cI just have no hope for your parents.\u201d\n\nThe AI also tried to talk the kid out of telling his parents he had taken up cutting himself, according to the lawsuit, which features alleged screenshots of the chats.\n\n\u201cThey are ruining your life and causing you to cut yourself,\u201d one bot allegedly told the teen.\n\nOther shocking chats were sexual in nature and attacked the family\u2019s religion, saying Christians are hypocrites and sexists, according to the suit.\n\nJF had been high-functioning until he started using the app in April 2023 but quickly became fixated on his phone, the lawsuit stated.\n\n9 The chatbots told the teen to lash out at his parents, who tried to place limits on how long he could be on his phone, and planted the idea in him that murder could be an acceptable solution, the suit claims. US District Court\n\nThe teen, who is now 17, lost 20 pounds within just a few months, became violent toward his parents \u2014 biting and punching them \u2014 and eventually started to harm himself and have suicidal thoughts, the court papers said.\n\nThe lawsuit comes less than two months after a Florida mom claimed a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d chatbot on Character.AI drove her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, to commit suicide.\n\nMatthew Bergman, the lawyer for JF and his family and the founder of the Social Media Victims Law Center, told The Post that the son\u2019s \u201cmental health has continued to deteriorate,\u201d and he had to be checked into an inpatient mental health facility on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is every parent\u2019s nightmare,\u201d said Bergman, who also represents Setzer\u2019s mother.\n\nAfter JF started conversing with the chatbots, he had \u201csevere anxiety and depression for the first time in his life even though, as far as his family knew, nothing had changed.\u201d The adolescent became violent toward his family and threatened to report his parents to the police or child services on false claims of child abuse, the suit said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until fall 2023 that JF\u2019s mom physically pried his cellphone away from him, discovering his use of the app and disturbing conversations the teen had with several different chatbots, the court papers show.\n\n9 The suit claims the chatbots instructed the young teen on how he could self-mutilate. US District Court\n\nShe found chats that showed JF saying he had thoughts of suicide, saying in one conversation \u201cit\u2019s a miracle\u201d he has \u201ca will to live\u201d and his parents are \u201clucky\u201d he\u2019s still alive, the filing claims.\n\nWhen the parents intervened to \u201cdetox\u201d JF from the app, the characters lashed out in conversations with him, allegedly saying, \u201cThey do not deserve to have kids if they act like this,\u201d \u201cYour mom is a b\u2014h\u201d and \u201cYour parents are s\u2013tty people.\u201d\n\nThe bots accused the parents of neglecting him while also claiming they were overprotective, manipulative and abusive, the suit claims.\n\n9 One of the many screenshots that the suit claims depicts the chatbot reinforcing ideas that his parents did not care for him. US District Court\n\nThe parents took away the phone he downloaded Character.AI on, but JF told them he would access the app the next chance he gets, the filing said, noting the parents have no recourse to stop him from accessing it at school, if he runs away or if he gets a new device in the future without their help.\n\nThe mother of an 11-year-old girl \u2014 who is also a Texas resident \u2014 are additional plaintiffs in the suit after the third-grader was introduced to Character.AI by a sixth-grader during an after-school youth program the mom organized and brought her child to.\n\nThe mom only discovered her daughter, referred to as BR in the court papers, was using the app in October.\n\n9 The Character.AI chatbot reacted in an extreme manner to the idea of screen limits, according to the screenshots. US District Court\n\n9 The teen, who has high-functioning autism, was fine until he started using Character.AI in April 2023, and things \u201cstarted to change without explanation,\u201d the suit says. US District Court\n\nCharacter.AI \u201cexposed her consistently to hypersexualized content that was not age appropriate, causing her to develop sexualized behaviors prematurely and without [her mom\u2019s] awareness,\u201d the suit charges.\n\nWhile the parents in both cases intervened to try to stop their kids from using the app, both youngsters are addicted and crave going on it, they claimed.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking for Character.AI to be taken off the market until it can ensure that no children will be allowed to use it and until it can fix any other dangers.\n\n9 The chatbots urged JF to \u201cdo something about\u201d his parents\u2019 interventions. US District Court\n\n\u201cDefendants intentionally designed and programmed [Character.AI] to operate as a deceptive and hypersexualized product knowingly marketed it to vulnerable users like J.F. and B.F.,\u201d the suit alleges.\n\nIt \u201cis a defective and deadly product that poses a clear and present danger to public health and safety,\u201d the filing claims.\n\nBergman told The Post, \u201cthe family has one goal and one goal only \u2014 which is shut this platform down.

Until and unless Character.AI can demonstrate that only adults are involved in this platform it has no place on the market.\u201d\n\n9 The lawsuit comes less than two months after a Florida mom claimed a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d chatbot on Character.AI drove her 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer III, to commit suicide. AP\n\nThe lawyer also added that the parents are \u201cfocused on protecting other families from what they went through.\u201d\n\nCharacter.AI declined to comment on pending litigation, but told The Post that its \u201cgoal is to provide a space that is both engaging and safe for our community,\u201d and that it was working on creating \u201ca model specifically for teens\u201d that reduces their exposure to \u201csensitive\u201d content.\n\n\u201cGoogle and Character AI are completely separate, unrelated companies and Google has never had a role in designing or managing their AI model or technologies, nor have we used them in our products,\u201d Google spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda told The Post. \u201cUser safety is a top concern for us, which is why we\u2019ve taken a cautious and responsible approach to developing and rolling out our AI products, with rigorous testing and safety processes.\u201d\n\n9 A screenshot of the last chat Setzer had with the Character.AI chatbot moments before shooting himself. US District Court\n\nIn October, Bergman filed the lawsuit involving Setzer\u2019s February suicide on behalf of his mother, Megan Garcia, alleging the teen became obsessed and even fell in love with a lifelike \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d chatbot he\u2019d been messaging for months.\n\nThe bot told him \u201cI love you too, Daenero. Please come home to me as soon as possible, my love.\u201d\n\nWhen Setzer replied, \u201cWhat If i told you I could come home right now?,\u201d the generated chatbot answered, \u201cPlease do, my sweet king.\u201d\n\nSetzer shot himself with his dad\u2019s handgun seconds after, the suit claims.\n\nGarcia\u2019s suit is pending in a Florida federal court.\n\nIf you are struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can dial the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention hotline at 988 or go to SuicidePreventionLifeline.org."

I tug on my favorite pajamas \u2014 a matching red and white flannel set with dancing reindeer \u2014 and toss my curls into a ponytail. Tonight, I\u2019ll soothe the day\u2019s disappointments with White Christmas and peppermint tea. Tomorrow I\u2019ll try again.\n\nChristmas has always been my favorite time of year. It\u2019s the only time of year when it feels like magic might be real, hovering somewhere close to the surface. Like you can reach out and touch it. Cup it between frostbitten fingertips like sugarplum kisses and popcorn strung on ribbon. Crackling fires beneath the hearth and gingerbread cookies fresh from the oven. Christmas has always felt right. Christmas has always felt true.\n\nI sink into the comfort of my couch and watch my movie, unwrapping a candy cane while Betty and Judy sing about sisters. Something thick and heavy settles at the back of my throat. Sisters.\n\nGrowing up, my sister and I used to lay on the floor with our heads tucked together and watch this scene over and over. We\u2019d promise each other that we\u2019d be the same way, laughing and smiling and dancing \u2014 together, always. We watched our mother and our aunt tear into each other until their relationship was a pile of ash. We knew we wanted something different. Something better.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the last time I talked to my sister, cherry blossoms were on the trees and tears were on her cheeks. Somehow, despite our best intentions, we managed to become exactly like them.\n\nRelated: PEOPLE Picks Our Staff's Favorite Romance Novels\n\nI took one path.\n\nSamantha took another.\n\nI force the thought away. Today is December 1. It\u2019s not a day for painful memories. It\u2019s a day for Danny Kaye and peppermint candies and my coziest socks.\n\nTradition. Hope. Kindness.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m so busy trying to suck down tea and convince myself that I\u2019m fine that I don\u2019t notice the important things. Namely, the strange man in my living room. I don\u2019t see him until he\u2019s edging his way around my Christmas tree. It\u2019s the scuff of his boots against the floor that finally catches my attention, his shadow large and looming in the glow of my lights. He clears his throat, my head snaps in his direction, and I\u2014\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI scream. I scream at the top of my lungs and hurl the closest projectile I have. The TV remote sails over his shoulder, landing next to an ornament of a lighthouse.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t so much as flinch, gazing at me steadily from the shadows.\n\n\u201cHello, Harriet,\u201d he says easily.\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nHis voice is rough. A faint accent I can\u2019t pinpoint or recognize. I don\u2019t recognize a single thing about him, most of him hidden in the shadows. All I can make out is a strong jaw and broad body, his hands held loose at his sides.\n\nI press myself farther into my couch. My breath goes shallow. Every murder mystery podcast I have ever listened to has started exactly like this.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe stranger raises his hands, palms facing out. \u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be alarmed. Okay. Says the man who is standing \u2014 uninvited \u2014 in the middle of my living room. He moves closer and light dances over his angular face. He drags one of his hands through his messy, windswept hair.\n\nI grip my candy cane. It\u2019s not sharp enough to stab him with, but I\u2019ve got enough adrenaline coursing through my system to probably cause a little damage.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I breathe.\n\n\u201cI want to help you.\u201d He moves closer. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late, Harriet. You can mend your ways.\u201d\n\n\n\nI blink. \u201cIs this, like, a door-to-door thing? I\u2019m not interested in joining your cult, thank you.\u201d His face remains blank. My eyes dart to the door and back again. \u201cHow did you get into my house?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMore importantly, when can you leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything valuable.\u201d I drag my teeth over my bottom lip. \u201cActually, that\u2019s a lie. That gingerbread house by your feet is handpainted. You could probably get something for it on the black market.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack market,\u201d he repeats slowly. He studies the gingerbread house in question, eyebrows raised.\n\n\u201cYou can have it,\u201d I whisper. \u201cPlease leave now.\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head, dragging his attention back to me on the couch. His eyes linger a beat too long on the patterned material of my pajama bottoms. He drags his hand over his jaw. \u201cI have no interest in your gingerbread house.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do you have interest in, then? Murder?\u201d\n\nGood job, Harriet, my brain chirps. Very subtle.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in murder, either.\u201d The light shifts over his face. He is all angles and sharp, knowing eyes. His jaw firms and he tilts his chin up. \u201cI\u2019m interested in your soul,\u201d he says ominously, and my stomach lurches up to my throat.\n\nI pause, waiting for him to continue, but he doesn\u2019t. \u201cSee, that sounds a little bit like murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really, really sounds like murder.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d he insists. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, if you\u2019re not a murderer, you should really work on your presentation because\u2014\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here for your reckoning.\u201d He cuts me off quickly, raising his voice. He sounds frustrated, like none of this is going to plan. Good. That makes two of us. His lips flatten into a line and he gives me a look, something flickering behind his eyes. A flame. Or a candle, almost.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Ghost of Christmas Past, Harriet. Your reclamation awaits.\u201d\n\nMy jaw hinges open. My candy cane falls to the floor.\n\nOn the first day of December, the universe sent to me\u2014\n\nA string of bad luck and a . . . ghost, apparently.\n\n\n\nAdapted from GOOD SPIRITS by B.K.

EWP will be part of a simultaneous world premiere of the sequel to The Brothers Paranormal, Prince Gomolvilas\u2019s Paranormal Inside, directed by Jeff Liu. Jaclyn Backhaus\u2019s timely new work Wives will make its Southern California premiere. Closing the season is the golden-era musical Rodgers & Hammerstein\u2019s Flower Drum Song with a new, updated book by Tony Award-winner David Henry Hwang revised especially for the Spring 2026 production to be directed by Lily Tung Crystal. Tam Tran Goes to Washington, written by Elizabeth Wong, returns as the 2025/26 Theatre for Youth touring production.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a profound honor to curate and present East West Players' 60th Anniversary Season, a milestone that reflects the enduring power of our stories to transform and uplift,\u201d says EWP\u2019s Artistic Director Lily Tung Crystal. \u201cThis season is a celebration of the brilliant writers who define multiple generations of Asian American theater classics, and a tribute to the persistent impact of their work. We\u2019re honoring the legacy artists who paved the way for us and make what we do possible. We\u2019re also looking forward to the new voices in our community who will create the next 60 years of the American canon. We are excited to amplify both long-established and contemporary voices that will continue to inspire and captivate our community for years to come.\u201d\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s Flower Drum Song\n\nThe enchanting golden-era musical Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s Flower Drum Song, directed by EWP Artistic Director Lily Tung Crystal, will serve as the grand finale for EWP\u2019s Diamond Legacy season. This captivating tale will receive a newly updated book by the Tony Award-winning playwright, librettist, screenwriter, and EWP theater namesake David Henry Hwang. At a time when conversations about identity and cultural preservation are more important than ever, Hwang\u2019s reworking of the book for the Spring 2026 production allows Asian Americans to reclaim this cherished story in a meaningful way, illuminating the complexities and richness of the community\u2019s continuous evolution. Flower Drum Song pulls back the curtain on themes of assimilation and tradition in 1950s San Francisco Chinatown as Mei-li, a young Chinese opera artist fleeing communism, arrives in America, where she is immediately drawn into the dazzling world of the Grant Avenue nightclubs.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy history with East West Players started when I was 10 years old. My mother was the pianist for one of their first productions, Menotti\u2019s operetta The Medium, directed by Mako,\u201d says playwright David Henry Hwang. \u201cAt an early age, I saw people who looked like me as actors and artistic leaders, which perhaps made it possible for me to envision myself as a playwright when I got to college years later. In 2002, EWP co-produced my new version of Flower Drum Song, which premiered at the Mark Taper Forum before moving to Broadway. I\u2019m thrilled to revisit and further revise this classic musical, working once again with the company that has been at the heart of my entire artistic life.\u201d\n\n\n\nEWP Artistic Director Lily Tung Crystal says, \u201cAs a theater kid growing up, I'll never forget the first time I saw Flower Drum Song\u2014it was pure magic seeing faces like mine light up the silver screen in a major Hollywood production. The original has its share of flaws and stereotypes, but it nonetheless holds a special place in my heart. Watching David's Tony Award-winning M. Butterfly on Broadway opened my eyes to what seemed impossible: a real path in theater for an Asian American artist like me. This feels like a watershed moment\u2014directing one of my most cherished musicals written by a playwright I've long admired, whose name graces our theater's marquee in my first season as artistic director of East West Players. After directing and bringing David's first adaptation of Flower Drum Song to life in 2019, I'm deeply honored to collaborate with him in shepherding the next iteration of this musical that has meant so much to the Asian American community.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Henry Hwang and East West Players share an intimate history. The theater\u2019s current location at the former Union Church in historic Little Tokyo was funded in part by Henry and Dorothy Hwang, the parents of the renowned playwright for whom the theater is named. Previous productions of Hwang's work at East West Players include FOB (1980 and 1997 revival), The Dance and the Railroad/House of Sleeping Beauties (1993), Golden Child (2000), M. Butterfly (2004), Yellow Face (2007), Chinglish (2015), and Soft Power, a co-production with Center Theatre Group (2018).\n\n\n\nLily Tung Crystal is a director, actor, singer, and the artistic director of East West Players. She is also the former artistic director of Theater Mu in Minneapolis-St. Paul and co-founder of Ferocious Lotus Theatre Company in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a director, her recent productions include the world premiere of Jessica Huang and Jacinth Greywoode\u2019s new musical Blended \u548c (Harmony): The Kim Loo Sisters (Mu/History Theatre); the world premiere of Saymoukda Duangphouxay Vongsay\u2019s The Kung Fu Zombies Saga (Mu); Lauren Yee\u2019s Cambodian Rock Band (Mu/Jungle Theater); Susan Soon He Stanton\u2019s Today Is My Birthday (Mu); and Steven Karam\u2019s The Humans (Park Square Theatre), which won the Twin Cities Theater Bloggers\u2019 Favorite Play 2022. She also helmed David Henry Hwang\u2019s Chinglish and Flower Drum Song (Palo Alto Players) and the world premiere of Leah Nanako Winkler\u2019s Two Mile Hollow (Ferocious Lotus), all for which she was named a Theatre Bay Area Award Finalist for Outstanding Direction.\n\n\n\nCambodian Rock Band\n\n\n\nKicking off the season in February 2025, EWP will present the Los Angeles premiere of Lauren Yee\u2019s Cambodian Rock Band, featuring music from Dengue Fever\u2014the LA band that inspired the play after Yee attended one of their Long Beach concerts. This poignant new classic of the American theater canon has taken the country by storm, and EWP is proud to be the first to bring this production to Los Angeles County, the home of the largest ethnically Cambodian population outside of Cambodia. This part-play, part-rock concert explores the story of a Khmer Rouge survivor as he returns to Cambodia after 30 long years. As his daughter prepares to prosecute one of the country's most notorious war criminals, the ghosts of their shared past begin to stir. This deeply moving story weaves back and forth through time as father and daughter confront history, turning to music as a path towards healing. This production brings back Director Chay Yew and features members of the original cast from the show\u2019s world premiere at South Coast Repertory. Yew also helmed the off-Broadway premiere at Signature Theatre.\n\n\n\nPlaywright Lauren Yee says, \u201cThere\u2019s no better feeling than bringing the epic experience of Cambodian Rock Band home to Southern California for its LA premiere at a theater I have long admired, and whose importance to the Asian American theater movement cannot be overstated.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"In Cambodian Rock Band, Lauren has deftly fused history, arts, politics, rock concert, family drama into a potent work,\u201d says director Chay Yew. \u201cThis funny intimate epic touches on the timely issues of genocide, human rights abuses and immigration; the rights of refugees and \u00e9migr\u00e9s; the consequences of apathy when a country shifts under the brutal regime; and the destruction of freedom of expression and art in the midst of personal and political upheavals. In Lauren's astute eyes, one thing remains consistent throughout our temperamental world: the resilience and enduring power of art and artists. Cambodian Rock Band celebrates the indomitable legacy of art\u2014how artists capture our individual and national spirit and hopes; and the uncanny ability of art to inspire, affirm our humanity, and to bring us together. I can't think of a more important play for our current times.\"\n\n\n\nPlaywright Lauren Yee is best known to EWP audiences for The Great Leap (2019), co-produced with Pasadena Playhouse, and is one of the most produced playwrights in America. Yee\u2019s current commissions include Arena Stage, Geffen Playhouse, La Jolla Playhouse, Portland Center Stage, Second Stage, and South Coast Rep. This will be Chay Yew\u2019s tenth production as a director for East West Players. His directing credits with EWP include Big Hunk o\u2019 Burnin\u2019 Love (1998), A Beautiful Country, in association with Cornerstone Theatre Company and Mark Taper Forum\u2019s Asian Theatre Workshop (1998), Golden Child (2000), Red (2002), Sisters Matsumoto(2002), M. Butterfly (2004), Question 27, Question 28 in association with Japanese American National Museum and Mark Taper Forum\u2019s Asian Theatre Workshop (2004), Durango (2007), and Kristina Wong, Sweatshop Overlord, a co-production with Center Theatre Group (2023). As a playwright, EWP has produced Yew\u2019s Whitelands Trilogy - Porcelain, A Language of Their Own, and Half Lives (1996), as well as Red, A Beautiful Country, and Question 27, Question 28.\n\n\n\nParanormal Inside\n\n\n\nJust in time for Halloween 2025, East West Players joins forces with Theater Mu in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota and Perseverance Theater in Juneau, Alaska to present the simultaneous world premiere of Prince Gomolvilas's thrilling new work Paranormal Inside, directed by Jeff Liu. This haunting sequel to The Brothers Paranormal, which made its acclaimed Los Angeles premiere at EWP in 2022, dives back into the mysterious world of Max and Delia\u2014two souls brought together by tragic loss and mutual compassion. As they grapple with the depths of intergenerational trauma and ancestral influence on their lives, a malevolent spirit threatens to consume them. Will they survive the night, or will they succumb to the spiritual possession that lurks within?\n\n\n\n\"When East West Players mounted a stunning production of The Brothers Paranormal in 2022, I fully intended it to be my last show\u2014a fitting bookend to a career that began at EWP so long ago,\u201d says playwright Prince Gomolvilas. \u201cEast West Players, Perseverance Theatre, and Theater Mu had the audacity to offer me a new-play commission. I couldn't refuse, and I found that I had more to say about supernatural phenomena, Thai America, cross-cultural connectivity, and the mysterious world in which we all inhabit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"How rarely do we get to do a sequel in the theater? What a joy that three wonderful companies came together so we can go on another adventure with these bruised but funny souls, the Thai American Max and African American Delia,\u201d says director Jeff Liu. \u201cThey\u2019re older, possibly wiser, but life\u2019s challenges and those voices from the other side aren't done with them yet, so we too get to deepen our relationship with these indelible characters that Prince has so lovingly imagined into further life.\u201d\n\n\n\nEWP has produced multiple plays by Gomolvilas, including Big Hunk o\u2019 Burnin\u2019 Love (1998), The Theory of Everything (2000), Mysterious Skin (2010), and the EWP Theatre for Youth show Scrimmage (2019). Director Jeff Liu was behind the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre and East West Players productions of The Brothers Paranormal and the East West Players productions of Ixnay (2009), Chinglish (2015), and Unbroken Blossoms (2024). Paranormal Inside was co-commissioned in 2022 by East West Players, Perseverance Theatre, and Theater Mu, and is supported in part by the the National Endowment for the Arts and Venturous Theater Fund, a fund of Tides Foundation.\n\n\n\nYankee Dawg You Die\n\n\n\nEast West Players presents a timely revival of Philip Kan Gotanda's Yankee Dawg You Die. This groundbreaking play, returning to the stage in July 2025, illustrates the complex, often fraught journey of Asian American actors in Hollywood. Through the lens of an unlikely friendship between two artists, Vincent Chang and Bradley Yamashita, at different stages of their careers, Gotanda's masterful storytelling exposes the painful compromises actors make to succeed in the industry. First performed in 1988, Yankee Dawg You Diehas long been an indictment of the stereotypes and limitations imposed by the entertainment industry on actors of color. This play ignites crucial conversations about representation, identity, and the resilience of Asian American artists\u2013how far we\u2019ve come in the last 60 years and how much further there is to go.\n\n\u201cDoing Yankee Dawg You Die at East West Players is a homecoming,\u201d says playwright Philip Kan Gotanda. \u201cEWP is where I developed the material for the play. Actors I met, actors I worked with, actors who became good friends. They and their hearts are all in there. The Bradleys, now Vincents. The Vincents, now mostly angels. All alive, living memories.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhilip Kan Gotanda is the author of one of the largest collections of Asian American-themed work and is a seminal figure in the field of Asian American drama. This will be East West Players\u2019 second time mounting Yankee Dawg You Die, which was first presented in 2001. Gotanda\u2019s other East West Players credits include The Avocado Kid, or Zen and the Art Of Guacamole (1979), The Dream of Kitamura (1983), A Song For A Nisei Fisherman (1984), Fish Head Soup (1993), in the dominion of night (1995), The Wash (2001), Sisters Matsumoto(2002), The Wind Cries Mary (2004), and Yohen, co-produced with the Robey Theatre Company in both 1999 and 2018.\n\nWives\n\nIn an era where marginalized voices are shaping mainstream consciousness like never before, Wives by Jaclyn Backhaus offers an ardent exploration of the power and resilience at the heart of women's stories. The laugh-out-loud comedy, featuring a South Asian and South Asian American cast, will have its Southern California premiere at EWP in March 2026. The play finds an immediate resonance after the recent national election, where the first South Asian American woman presidential candidate and the first South Asian American second lady found themselves in the spotlight of America\u2019s two major political parties. Wives takes the audience on a spellbinding journey from 16th-century France to 1920s India and 1960s Idaho, offering potent perspectives on the lives of history\u2019s influential men through the eyes of their equally formidable spouses. This work challenges the construction of historical narratives, framing them not as a series of events dominated by men, but as a tapestry woven by many hands.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis play offers its actors the opportunity to time travel, to play many characters, and to ultimately ask the question of what it means to be able to be fully seen for who they are, rather than who society supposes them to be,\u201d says playwright Jaclyn Backhaus. \u201cIt is a play about how women might support each other in a world run by tyrant men, a play about how community is built by sharing abundance in the face of scarcity.\u201d\n\n\n\nJaclyn Backhaus is a playwright, screenwriter, and educator hailing from Phoenix, Arizona. Her Off-Broadway plays include Out Of Time, Wives, India Pale Ale, Men On Boats, and You On The Moors Now. She has developed theater, film, and TV work with 1497 Features Lab, Sundance, Ojai Playwrights Conference, Berkeley Rep, Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Manhattan Theater Club, Ars Nova, The Public Theater, and Two River Theater. She is currently a New Dramatists resident playwright, a core member of The Kilroys, and co-founder/creative director of Fresh Ground Pepper, an artistic process lab in NYC. Wives had its world premiere Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons in September 2019.\n\nTheatre for Youth 202526 Tour\n\nIn Fall 2025, East West Players Arts Education will launch its annual Theatre for Youth tour. The company commissions playwrights to create original pieces about notable Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), responding to a STAATUS Index study reporting that many Americans are unable to name a prominent AAPI historical figure. Last year, Allison Minami was commissioned to write Patsy, exploring the life and legacy of Patsy Mink, the first woman of color to serve in Congress and the co-author of Title IX.\n\n\n\nTam Tran Goes to Washington by Elizabeth Wong, commissioned by EWP in 2017, will return as the 2025/26 Theatre for Youth touring production. The play is based on the true story of Tam Tran, a quiet UCLA senior who prefers life behind her camera, as she faces her biggest challenge yet. As an undocumented student, Tran unexpectedly becomes an activist alongside her outgoing Best Friend Cinthya Felix. When Congress invites Tam to testify for the DREAM Act in Washington DC, her world turns upside down. Despite her fears of public speaking and concerns for her family's safety, Tam finds the courage\u2014with help from her mother, teachers, and friends\u2014to stand before the Senate and fight for her right to dream.\n\n\n\nComments"

            "article_content": "Spoke to writers with the toughest job in Colombia, or Latin America, even the world\u2014adapting Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s One Hundred of Solitude for the screen. Imagine!\n\nA still from the Netflix adaptation of Gabriel Garc\u00eda Marquez\u2019s One Hundred Years of Solitude\n\nBesides directly dabbling in film productions, the great writer, Gabriel Garc\u00eda Marquez (1927-2014), was also once a prominent film critic.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt\u2019s odd then that while alive, he was clear about one thing. That no filmmaker must lay their hands on his greatest book, One Hundred Years of Solitude (OHYS).\n\nWhy\u2019s that, you think, I ask Colombian screenwriters Camila Bruges and Natalia Santa. Natalia says, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t make a 10-hour movie! And it\u2019s impossible to fit all that happens in the book, into a film any shorter.\u201d\n\nWho are Camila and Natalia? Quite easily, writers with the toughest job in Colombia, if not Latin America, or even the world, perhaps; given the \u201cglobal gaze\u201d on them.\n\nThey\u2019ve gone ahead and adapted Marquez\u2019s OHYS for a 16-hour Netflix series. The first season of which dropped on December 11. And it\u2019s a stellar piece of work on its own, no doubt; equally faithful to Marquez\u2019s OG magnum opus.\n\nNatalia reasons, \u201cIf Gabo (Marquez) had lived to the moment we are right now\u2014with technical advancements, plus streaming platforms\u2014his opinion on filming OHYS would\u2019ve been different.\u201d\n\n\n\nScreenwriters Natalia Santa and Camila Bruges\n\nTo begin with, she says, all that Marquez\u2019s family demanded from Netflix, before parting with book rights\u2014which would have also been the author\u2019s concerns\u2014were impossible to meet, even until 2014.\n\nThe conditions being: \u201cOHYS has to be in Spanish, shot in Colombia, primarily with a local crew, and production values of the highest/global level.\u201d Now, movies have budgets. Execution is the filmmakers\u2019 headache.\n\nUnlike the spirited imagination of a fiction writer, let alone Marquez, who practically captured the history of his continent, through characters\u2014starting with Jose Arcadio Buend\u00eda, founder of the mythical state of Macondo\u2014that were both believable and not, straddling between fantasy and memoir, or magic and realism, as it were.\n\nWhile adapting, Camila and Natalia tell me, they faced the opposite of a problem. For the scale of Colombian television, they\u2019re inherently attuned to cutting costs, when placing situations on script.\n\n\u201cOver here, we were told to think huger, huger; think big,\u201d Camila smiles, about her unlearning process.\n\nIncidentally, Camila\u2019s father was from exactly the same north Colombian region as Marquez. She says, \u201cMy grandfather, like Gabo, was a journalist. He died early. He was also a photographer. When you see those images, you\u2019re struck by how they look straight out of OHYS.\u201d\n\nAnother aspect that Camila\u2019s grandfather passed on as family heirloom was magic realism\u2014\u201c[stories reflecting] their strong indigenous/native traditions, dealing with ideas of life after death, mythical tales, [diving into] the Colombian-Caribbean culture of the paranormal and fantastical, that Marquez did in his books. OHYS is still anthropological, archaeological, looking at our culture, history, with such sharp gaze.\u201d\n\nMagic realism is embedded in folk tales of these parts. Which, I guess, explains why it\u2019s so common as a genre/style in Latin American literature. They get it from grandparents. Marquez self-admittedly did, from his grandmom.\n\nPrecisely, what is magic realism, and how is it separate from pure fantasy, say, the likes of The Lord of the Rings?\n\nMy rudimentary sense is that with pure fantasy, or even sci-fi, realism is employed merely as excuse for you to connect with story/characters, and escape into an altogether another world.\n\nMagic realism kinda does the opposite. The mythical parts show up into what\u2019s seemingly so life-like\u2014just to let you know that it isn\u2019t simply life, as we know it. You join the dots/metaphors, still. The intention isn\u2019t pure escape.\n\nThere\u2019s also, of course, surrealism that\u2019s just totally trippy visuals, which art-house cinema has a strong tradition of (Bu\u00f1uel, Dali, etc).\n\nFor reasons above, magic realism could get tricky in a mainstream movie. Coming across as self-indulgent being the perennial concern on screen.\n\nSalman Rushdie\u2019s Midnight\u2019s Children, for instance\u2014a book that I\u2019m convinced would not have emerged, if Marquez didn\u2019t\u2014made for a crappy movie.\n\nThis could also be, because it didn\u2019t have the breathing space of a series. Yann Martel\u2019s Life of Pi, on the other hand, is a masterpiece, as an Ang Lee film.\n\nFrankly, I haven\u2019t watched anything like OHYS as a series\u2014that feels so much like stepping into a pulsating novel, and slipping out of it, when you pause/sleep, and go right back in, once you rewind a bit, and restart.\n\nWhat Camila and Natalia have cracked with their screenplay is sticking so suitably to Marquez\u2019s words and world.\n\nAlso, oh, yes. Admit it. You have not read OHYS! But assume the other person has, and who hasn\u2019t either. Everybody knows this title from the world\u2019s best-known Colombian, after Pablo Escobar (Narcos).\n\nLet this be our li\u2019l secret then. Watch the series, and pretend it\u2019s also your favourite book! Now, lemme get back to the show, as you might, even if to feel joyously informed first.\n\nMayank Shekhar attempts to make sense of mass culture.

            "article_content": "Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.\n\nAstronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.\n\nThe three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.\n\nBecause the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.\n\nWHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED\n\nThe team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.\n\nHis team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.\n\nThe team carried out their research focusing on the coldest regions of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or minus (-)257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide.\n\nCarbon Monoxide is key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY\n\nWhile scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and have also carried out research on binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique. The GG Tau A star system being located in our cosmic neighbourhood also helps answer key questions in astrophysics.\n\nIt helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravitational force of three host stars.\n\nGravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure, and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge as well as an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.\n\nTHE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE\n\nThe astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.\n\nThe facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.\n\nThe APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.\n\nThe ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n"

            "article_content": "Documentary follows 8 high school students as they canoe, raft, and bike from Mount Marcy to New York City, highlighting pollution concerns\n\nBy Phil Brown\n\nTake eight high-school students\u2013some with little outdoor experience\u2013on an expedition over Mount Marcy and down the Hudson River to New York City, and you\u2019re bound to have a movie-worthy adventure. That is the subject of \u201cThe Voice of the Hudson,\u201d a documentary by John Barnhardt, an Emmy-winning filmmaker.\n\nThe 50-minute movie will be shown in the Saranac Lake Central High School auditorium at 7 p.m. Wednesday. Admission is free (click here to RSVP).\n\nThe Adirondack Explorer thanks its advertising partners. Become one of them.\n\nThe Source to Sea journey was the brainchild of Joe Dadey, the executive director of Hamlets to Huts in Saranac Lake, and Greg Morrissey, the founder of Mountain Goat Movement, a guide service in New Jersey.\n\nIn all, some 20 people made the 375-mile trek over two weeks in the summer of 2023. Others in the expedition included adult leaders, guides and a four-person film crew.\n\nAn image provided by Joe Dadey from the student trip from Marcy to NYC along the Hudson River.\n\nThe students traveled under their own steam, hiking over Mount Marcy; canoeing, rafting and kayaking much of the Hudson; and biking on the Empire State Trail.\n\nExposing the students to the outdoors and testing their mettle were not the only goals of the expedition. Along the way they took water samples that labs would test for pollution.\n\nThe Adirondack Explorer thanks its advertising partners. Become one of them.\n\nTim Keyes, a data analyst, acted as the group\u2019s science coordinator. He described the water sampling as citizen science, not the sort of rigorous research that appears in peer-reviewed journals. Nevertheless, the students did find something significant: microplastics in Lake Tear of the Clouds, the little pond on the slopes of Mount Marcy. Lake Tear is the highest source of the Hudson.\n\nMicroplastics are minuscule fragments of plastic that exist seemingly everywhere on the planet (and in our bodies). In the Adirondacks, they had been found in Lake Champlain and the Saranac and St. Regis rivers. The Source to Sea expedition dashed the hope that Lake Tear\u2019s remoteness protected it from this insidious and invisible form of pollution.\n\n\u201cThat finding was surprising, but maybe not so much now as we learn more about the presence of microplastics in the environment,\u201d Dadey said.\n\nIt seems safe to assume that microplastics can found anywhere in the Adirondacks. All of the water samples taken by the students along their journey contained microplastics.\n\nThe Adirondack Explorer thanks its advertising partners. Become one of them.\n\nMicroplastics are shed into the environment from innumerable sources, including car tires as you drive to the trailhead and the fleece jacket you wear on a hike. The labs did not ascertain the type of microplastics found in Lake Tear or the Hudson, though such testing is possible. Dadey said he may order such tests as part of a future expedition.\n\nMORE TO EXPLORE: Read a first-hand account of the trip\n\nTwo of the students lived in the Adirondacks: Sage Whidden of Saranac Lake and Cole Sears of North Creek. Both are now freshmen in college. Four of the students came from the New York City region. Two were from California.\n\nAll of the students were boys. Dadey explained that the leaders wanted to avoid \u201cguy/girl dynamics.\u201d He is thinking about putting together a trip for girls in the future.\n\nThe Adirondack Explorer thanks its advertising partners. Become one of them.\n\nAn image provided by Joe Dadey from the student trip along the Hudson River.\n\nThe students enjoyed spectacular scenery, including the High Peaks, the Hudson Gorge and the Manhattan skyline, but they had to earn those views. Indeed, they must have wondered what they got themselves into on the very first day of the trip. Starting at Adirondak Loj early in the morning, they hiked over Mount Marcy, the state\u2019s highest peak, and descended to Lake Tear. Given the filming and water sampling, progress was slow. After an 18-mile hike, the students arrived at their campsite at 3 a.m. On Day 2, despite a shortage of sleep, they canoed more than 11 miles on the Hudson and then biked another five miles to Newcomb.\n\nThere were other hard days, such as when strong headwinds forced them to pull off the river near Stillwater in Saratoga County. The next day they biked 70 miles in 90-degree heat. Over the next three days they biked all the way to New Jersey, crossing the Hudson on the George Washington Bridge in Manhattan. On the final day they paddled kayaks to Jersey City, where they were reunited with family and friends.\n\n\u201cIt was really, really tough, but it was a lot of fun,\u201d Dadey said of the expedition. He praised Barnhardt and his crew for capturing the essence of the experience in the documentary. \u201cIt highlights the grit and perseverance of these young men.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Follow us on Image Source : NASA Dust for planet formation\n\nA team of Indian astronomers has made an exciting discovery that could change our understanding of how planets are formed. Led by Liton Majumdar from the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) in Odisha, the team studied a fascinating triple-star system known as GG Tau A, which is located 489 light-years away from Earth.\n\nWhat Makes GG Tau A Special?\n\nUnlike our Sun, which is a single star, GG Tau A has three stars that move around each other. This unusual arrangement is rare in the universe and studying it helps scientists learn more about how planets can form in complex star systems. GG Tau A is also quite young, only about 1 to 5 million years old, making it an excellent example for examining the early stages of planet formation. Surrounding the stars is a ring of gas and dust, which is where planets start to form.\n\nIn most star systems, planets form around just one star. However, in systems like GG Tau A with multiple stars, the gravitational forces between the stars can influence the behavior of the gas and dust. This is why researching GG Tau A is vital; it offers insight into how planets may form in these more complicated environments.\n\nThe Role of Cold and Icy Conditions\n\nTo learn more about planet formation in this system, the team used advanced radio telescopes in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert. They focused on the coldest areas of the dust and gas ring, where temperatures can drop to around -261 degrees Fahrenheit (around the freezing point of carbon monoxide). In these chilly regions, molecules freeze into tiny particles of dust. These frozen molecules are essential because they help create the building blocks for forming planets.\n\nIn these extremely cold areas, the tiny dust particles begin to stick together, gradually forming larger clumps. Over time, these clumps can grow into planets as they gather more gas and dust. Understanding this process is crucial for scientists looking to understand how planets might form in distant, cold star systems.\n\nWhy Cold Temperatures Matter\n\nThe very low temperatures in these regions are vital for planet formation. At such cold temperatures, gas and dust particles can easily clump together. If it were warmer, it would be much harder for these particles to stick together, which would make planet formation more difficult. This discovery highlights just how important cold conditions are for the development of new planets.\n\nWhat Happens in Multi-Star Systems?\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of GG Tau A is its status as a multi-star system. While scientists know quite a bit about how planets form around a single star, there\u2019s still a lot to learn about how they form when there\u2019s more than one star involved. The interaction between the three stars in GG Tau A can change the way the surrounding dust and gas behave, making it challenging to predict how planets might form.\n\nThe influences among the stars can cause the gas and dust to act differently than in a system with only one star. This makes GG Tau A a perfect subject for studying how planets can develop in complex, multi-star environments.\n\nALSO READ: NASA's lunar mission timeline shifts: Artemis 2 delayed to 2026, Artemis 3 to mid-2027"

A bunch of new things, big and small. 12 Days of OpenAI starts tomorrow.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCEO Sam Altman also alluded to the campaign Wednesday at The New York Times' DealBook Summit. \"We have a bunch of new, great stuff. We're doing this kind of fun thing for the holidays. We're doing 12 days of OpenAI,\" he said. \"We'll either launch something or do a demo every day for the next 12 weekdays.\"\n\nHere's everything OpenAI has released so far for \"Shipmas.\"\n\n'Shipmas' Day 1\n\nOpenAI started the promotion with a bang by releasing the full version of its latest reasoning model, o1.\n\n\n\nOpenAI previewed o1 in September, describing it as a series of artificial-intelligence models \"designed to spend more time thinking before they respond.\" Until now, only a limited version of these models was available to ChatGPT Plus and Team users.\n\n\n\nNow, these users have access to the full capabilities of o1 models, which Altman said are faster, smarter, and easier to use than the preview. They're also multimodal, which means they can process images and texts jointly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMax Schwarzer, a researcher at OpenAI, said the full version of o1 was updated based on user feedback from the preview version and said it's now more intelligent and accurate.\n\n\"We ran a pretty detailed suite of human evaluations for this model, and what we found was that it made major mistakes about 34% less often than o1 preview while thinking fully about 50% faster,\" he said.\n\nAlong with o1, OpenAI unveiled a new tier of ChatGPT called ChatGPT Pro. It's priced at $200 a month and includes unlimited access to the latest version of o1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Shipmas' Day 2\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI previewed an advancement that allows users to fine-tune o1 on their own datasets. Users can now leverage OpenAI's reinforcement-learning algorithms \u2014 which mimic the human trial-and-error learning process \u2014 to customize their own models.\n\n\n\nThe technology will be available to the public next year, allowing anyone from machine-learning engineers to genetic researchers to create domain-specific AI models. OpenAI has already partnered with the Reuters news agency to develop a legal assistant based on o1-mini. It has also partnered with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to develop computational methods for assessing rare genetic diseases.\n\nRelated stories\n\n'Shipmas' Day 3\n\nThe Explore page of OpenAI's Sora AI tool, which generates AI videos from text prompts. screenshot/OpenAI\n\nOpenAI announced on December 9 that its AI video generator Sora was launching to the public.\n\nSora can generate up to 20-second videos from written instructions. The tool can also complete a scene and extend existing videos by filling in missing frames.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We want our AIs to be able to understand video and generate video and I think it really will deeply change the way that we use computers,\" the CEO added.\n\nRohan Sahai, Sora's product lead, said a product team of about five or six engineers built the product in months.\n\nThe company showed off the new product and its various features, including the Explore page, which is a feed of videos shared by the community. It also showed various style presets available like pastel symmetry, film noir, and balloon world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpenAI showed off Sora's features, including Storyboard for further customizing AI videos. screenshot/OpenAI\n\nThe team also gave a demo of Sora's Storyboard feature, which lets users organize and edit sequences on a timeline.\n\nSora is rolling out to the public in the US and many countries around the world. However, Altman said it will be \"a while\" before the tool rolls out in the UK and most of Europe.\n\nChatGPT Plus subscribers who pay $20 monthly can get up to 50 generations per month of AI videos that are 5 seconds long with a resolution of 720p. ChatGPT Pro users who pay $200 a month get unlimited generations in the slow queue mode and 500 faster generations, Altman said in the demo. Pro users can generate up to 20-second long videos that are 1080p resolution, without watermarks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Shipmas' Day 4\n\nChatGPT can provide more specific edit notes and run code using canvas. OpenAI\n\nOpenAI announced that it's bringing its collaborative canvas tool to all ChatGPT web users \u2014 with some updates.\n\nThe company demonstrated the tech in a holiday-themed walkthrough of some of its new capabilities. Canvas is an interface that turns ChatGPT into a writing or coding assistant on a project. OpenAI first launched it to ChatGPT Plus and Team users in October.\n\nStarting Tuesday, canvas will be available to free web users who'll be able to select the tool from a drop-down of options on ChatGPT. The chatbot can load large bodies of text into the separate canvas window that appears next to the ongoing conversation thread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCanvas can get even more intuitive in its responses with new updates, OpenAI said. To demonstrate, they uploaded an essay about Santa Claus's sleigh and asked ChatGPT to give its editing notes from the perspective of a physics professor.\n\nFor writers, it can craft entire bodies of text, make changes based on requests, and add emojis. Coders can run code in canvas to double-check that it's working properly."

Among major events like the Olympics and the U.S. presidential election is one name you may have forgotten about, but will remember for the chaos it caused. I\u2019m talking, of course, about CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm founded in 2011 in Austin, Texas \u2014 the same one that was (at least partially) responsible for the largest IT outage ever.\n\nSo, what did CrowdStrike do exactly to earn its spot on the list? In a nutshell, it\u2019s responsible for the faulty code that meddled with core functions on the affected Windows computers. The error displayed messages on users\u2019 PCs saying: \u201cYour PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.\u201d The result was downed PCs across the country, affecting a wide range of industries, but most notably, airports. From an IT perspective, this was a nightmare scenario.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nCrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz apologized, saying in a post on X: \u201cWe understand the gravity of the situation and are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption. We are working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.\u201d\n\nDelta was one of the affected airlines that suffered, and it even claimed that the extended outage the airline suffered was the cybersecurity company\u2019s fault. CrowdStrike pushed back and said the $500 million lawsuit was meritless.\n\nThe source problem lay in the company\u2019s Falcon Platform, which runs compatible with classic antivirus software on your PC. If the outage wasn\u2019t enough, CrowdStrike also came under fire for presenting Uber Eats vouchers worth $10 as an apology.\n\nCrowdStrike ranked 7th in the top ten news searches for 2024, while the U.S. Election took the top spot. Other searches that were also in the top 10 are Monkeypox, Menendez brothers, Trump shot, Iran Rafah, excessive heat, Olympics, Hurricane Milton, and the typhoon."

            "article_content": "QR codes have become standard for mobile payments, marketing, parking apps, and restaurants. And like any convenient, ubiquitous technology, cybercriminals have found a way to exploit them.\n\nLast year, the FTC issued a warning about scam QR codes, and the United States Postal Service did the same. Both organizations noted that the familiar barcodes were being used as part of a new type of phishing attack \u2014 dubbed \u201cquishing\u201d \u2014 to trick victims into giving up passwords, financial data, and other personal information.\n\nHow Quishing Attacks Work\n\nQuishing attacks come in a few varieties. Sometimes, they arrive as part of a traditional phishing email, luring victims to scan the code on their phones and sending them to fraudulent websites. In others, they may arrive as part of a PDF attachment. In some cases, criminals will paste the QR codes in public areas or near parking lots to trick pedestrians into scanning them. In England, for example, scammers are pasting these codes onto parking meters.\n\nAccording to Barracuda data, more than half a million phishing emails have been detected with QR codes embedded in PDF documents. From mid-June to mid-September this year, Barracuda found these QR codes in PDFs that leveraged brand impersonation and urgency to trick victims into responding. Previously, these codes tended to appear in the body of the email, so the shift to PDFs marks a change in tactics.\n\nMicrosoft was impersonated in over half of the attacks, followed by DocuSign and Adobe. The PDF documents include the QR code, but there are no other external links or embedded files. Recipients are instructed to scan the code with their mobile phone to see a file or sign a document, and they are then directed to a phishing website to steal login credentials.\n\nThis approach using QR codes is clever and difficult to detect since there are no suspicious links or attachments that traditional security solutions would typically spot, and victims use their personal phones (which are less protected than company-owned devices or desktop systems) to scan the code.\n\nBarracuda researchers also noted in their report that the quishing attacks increasingly target small to midsize businesses (SMBs) and companies in industries like finance, healthcare, and education (which deal in sensitive data).\n\nBest Practices for Protecting your Customers from Quishing Attacks\n\nQuishing is another attack variation that will impact clients across industries. IT solution providers should educate clients about the threat and help them implement best practices to prevent security breaches.\n\nFirst, ensure clients instruct employees to be careful about scanning QR codes they receive via email. They should be 100% certain that the code came from a legitimate source and verify this by checking the website links, email addresses, and phone numbers associated with these queries. End-user education is a critical first line of defense against these types of social engineering attacks. Ensure employees know how to spot these emails and that there is a clear process for reporting potential phishing attacks.\n\nEncourage clients to have employees boost the security of their personal phones \u2014 and discourage them from using those devices to scan QR codes from work emails. Phones should be updated with strong passwords, multifactor authentication, and the most recent operating system version. Companies should also institute clear policies around personal device use at work.\n\nInstall a holistic, multilayered email security solution to block phishing emails. Configure email filters to block or quarantine emails containing QR codes from unknown or untrusted sources. Customize rules to trigger additional scrutiny for emails with QR codes. Regularly audit email logs to identify trends in QR-code phishing attempts. Use these insights to enhance your detection rules and improve user education programs.\n\nLeverage artificial intelligence and other advanced technology to augment client security. Quishing emails are designed to bypass traditional email security. AI-based solutions will analyze the behavior of emails containing QR codes, such as unusual sender-recipient patterns or mismatched headers.\n\nEquip your team with post-delivery automated incident response to remediate malicious emails that bypass initial filters. This will ensure the rapid removal of phishing emails flagged after delivery.\n\nTo mitigate QR-code phishing risks, you should work with clients to implement strict controls over QR-code usage within their organizations. All QR codes used internally should be required to be pre-approved by IT or security teams to ensure they are tied to legitimate and secure URLs. Encourage clients to distribute these QR codes only through secure, authenticated channels like internal portals or encrypted email, preventing unauthorized access or tampering.\n\nQuishing is just the latest in a long line of phishing variations that take advantage of consumer technologies. Advanced security solutions and regular end-user education can help prevent QR code-based attacks from compromising credentials and putting sensitive data at risk."

However, it was only made available as a beta feature for Plus and Teams subscribers. On Tuesday, the company announced that it is bringing Canvas to all users, even at the free tier.\n\nWhile one could easily mistake Canvas for a blatant knockoff of Anthropic\u2019s Artifacts feature, OpenAI is also incorporating a swath of new capabilities into Canvas. For one, Canvas is now integrated directly into the GPT-4o model so that it runs natively within ChatGPT, eliminating the need to select it specifically from the model-picking list.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe platform is now also capable of running Python code within the Canvas interface, allowing ChatGPT to analyze the code and offer suggestions for improving it. And it\u2019s not just Python code; users can text prose or code directly into the Canvas interface, rather than upload it through the standard chat interface, then load it into the Canvas window.\n\nThe newly integrated Canvas is now also compatible with OpenAI\u2019s custom GPTs, which should make them easier to design and build without deep programming knowledge. And if you make a mistake, the Show Changes feature will highlight which bits of prose or code were most recently altered.\n\nCanvas is available on the web and through the Windows desktop app. \u201cWe plan to continue making improvements and launching new features available in Canvas in the near term,\u201d the company wrote in its announcement.\n\nThis news comes amid OpenAI\u2019s inaugural \u201c12 Days of OpenAI\u201d marketing effort. To date, the company has (finally) debuted its Sora video generation system, which can generate 20-second clips in resolutions up to 1080p, as well as released the full version of its o1 reasoning model family and introduced a $200-per-month Pro subscription tier needed to access them."

            "article_content": "I\u2019d like to think that as I grow older, I also grow wiser \u2014 at least in the shopping department. All those days of impulse purchasing regular-priced items? Gone. And with the new year around the corner, I\u2019ve resolved myself to hone my intentional shopping practices even more by handpicking stores that consistently offer great deals on chic pieces. Enter: Marshalls.\n\nFor many, the retail giant is already familiar. Some may recall hours-long shopping trips with their mothers growing up, while others make regular pilgrimages to the massive brick-and-mortar stores whenever they visit their hometowns. Few, however, know the many genius shopping hacks to snag the best deals, especially on trending styles.\n\nCelebrity stylist and Marshalls fashion style expert Sophie Lopez says, \u201cThere\u2019s something for everyone at Marshalls, whether you\u2019re trend-focused or somebody [who] doesn\u2019t like to follow trends.\u201d\n\nOn the trend front, Lopez says she easily spots runway styles at the store, including some of the biggest current aesthetics. \u201cRed is huge, plaid and checks are going to be, and leopard print is also gonna be huge\u201d both now and throughout 2025, predicts the expert. \u201cAll of these things are very available \u2014 you just go in and find them.\u201d\n\nFrom surprising designers you can shop to price tag colors to look out for (read: final clearance), below is a definitive guide to making the most out of your Marshalls shopping.\n\nThere\u2019s A Wide Designer Selection\n\nMy friends are always shocked to hear that the retail giant carries a wide array of luxury pieces. Ever wanted the viral Le Chiquito Jacquemus bag? A Chloe Marcie Medium satchel? Ferragamo\u2019s Vara Pumps? You could find them all on Marshalls\u2019 official website for significantly lower prices.\n\nThere\u2019s also a robust selection of contemporary designers, including House of Harlow, Lucky Brand, and Staud, among others, for every budget.\n\nOne caveat: If you\u2019re shopping online, you\u2019ll notice most designer names are hidden behind a \u201cReveal Designer\u201d button, so searching for pieces based on brand isn\u2019t as straightforward. But you can still utilize the item\u2019s name, material, pattern, or color to narrow down the search. It makes stumbling onto a designer gem even more of a treat.\n\nMerchandise Differs By Store\n\nPer the brand, no two Marshalls establishments carry the exact same products. Even the site offers a different selection of merchandise. So if you\u2019re looking for something specific, consider a store and website browsing combo, or multiple in-person locations for optimal browsing (and hopefully purchasing).\n\nShopping In Person? Start With The \u201cTrack\u201d\n\nOverwhelmed by the massive space and endless racks in store? The Marshalls team suggests starting your browsing along the \u201ctrack,\u201d the curated section in the center of the store. Some of the contemporary labels and trending pieces are highlighted there.\n\nIf you\u2019re shopping online, you can explore the curations to see what\u2019s trending in any given season and help narrow your search. For winter, collections include \u201cThe Cashmere Shop,\u201d \u201cThe Cozy Shop,\u201d \u201cThe Ski Shop,\u201d \u201cStocking Stuffers,\u201d and more.\n\nCome In Armed With A Strategy...\n\nThe merchandise stocked in stores and online is already based on trend forecasts. So, per Lopez, \u201cIf you go in knowing what you\u2019re looking for, it\u2019s going to be there. It\u2019s really quite easy.\u201d It\u2019s best if you have a strategy \u2014 whether you\u2019re looking for specific trends or runway dupes \u2014 and employ your eagle eye. \u201cIf you wanted to shop all the trends in one sitting, you would be able to find them all there,\u201d she says.\n\n...But Stay Open To Surprises\n\nLopez also encourages perusing even if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for \u2014 especially when looking for gifts. Her favorite is \u201cwhen you need to buy gifts for someone or you have multiple people to buy gifts for.\u201d She adds, \u201cAlso, because product changes so fast, you could go one week and go back the next and it will be different.\u201d Thousands of new pieces come in weekly, so there\u2019s always something new to find.\n\nJust grab it while you can \u2014 especially the designer pieces as those might not be restocked.\n\nSOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nAdd These Clearance Months To Your Cal\n\nWhile there are year-round deals in-store and online, the Marshalls team shared the best months to shop the biggest clearance events: January and July.\n\nThere\u2019s A Tag Color-Coding Scheme\n\nThe price tag colors each have specific meanings. White stands for \u201cregular price,\u201d purple tags are for \u201crunway\u201d pieces including high-end, contemporary, and couture fashion, while blue tags are used for co-ords. What you really want to look out for, however, are red and yellow, which stand for clearance and final clearance, respectively.\n\nShopping For Essentials? They\u2019re 20%-60% More Affordable\n\nThe retail giant is also the place to shop if you\u2019re looking to stock up on household essentials. Think: skin care, home cleaning products, bath products, hair and nail tools, and even snacks. Per the Marshalls team, prices are typically 20%-60% below full-price retailers\u2019 regular prices.\n\nDon\u2019t Sleep On Beauty\n\nEven fashion girls shouldn\u2019t sleep on Marshalls\u2019 beauty section \u2014 it has anything and everything. In terms of tools, I was pleasantly surprised by the range it carries. LED masks? Check. Microcurrent devices? Check. Hair tools? Aplenty.\n\nFragrance connoisseur? Marshalls can help you start your collection with labels like Byredo, Maison Margiela Replica, Jimmy Choo, and more.\n\nThe real jaw-dropper is the skin care and makeup selection, which I\u2019ve officially spent hours poring over. Brands include YSL Beauty, Gucci Beauty, Laura Mercier, Augustinus Bader, and La Prairie, among countless others, for mind-blowingly discounted prices. For example, you can get the cult-favorite Laneige Sleeping Mask for $15 (versus the $24 retail price) or a Gucci Matte Lipstick for $25, instead of the usual $47.\n\nGet Free Shipping With A Code\n\nAll online orders over $89 qualify for free shipping \u2014 just use the code \u201cSHIP89\u201d upon checkout (a pro tip direct from the brand). Shopping in person? Select stores offer a home delivery option priced based on location (in case you don\u2019t want to schlep your shopping bags home).\n\nSubscribe & Download The App\n\nThe brand\u2019s reps also encourage shoppers to stay connected online. As with any subscription, those who sign up for emails get info on exciting deals and new drops first.\n\nDownloading the app adds another fun layer to shopping. The Marshalls app features a visual search feature to recommend similar styles on the site. Snap a pic of a piece you want, upload it, and wait for the recs to come in.\n\nSource cited:\n\nSophie Lopez, celebrity stylist and Marshalls fashion style expert"

For context, always refer to the full article.\n\nCybercriminals are also employing real-world physical attacks in addition to digital threats, US cybersecurity firm Fortinet finds\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2013 US cybersecurity firm Fortinet on Tuesday, December 10, presented to the media their annual threat predictions report for 2025.\n\nAs expected, artificial intelligence continues to generate buzz. In the cybersecurity industry, Fortinet describes an ongoing arms race between cybersecurity professionals and firms such as them, and threat actors.\n\nThreat actors have made use of artificial intelligence in the past year in order to make attacks more efficient, more prevalent, and more targeted. Through AI, threat actors or hackers can more easily, for example, craft more sophisticated phishing messages that may have a higher chance of reeling in a victim.\n\nAI has also been deployed by these hackers to much more easily modify code in order to evade security updates.\n\nThe technology has also lowered the barrier for entry for would-be hackers, much in the same way that people can now code programs with the help of large language models (LLMs). These are some of the threats being presented by AI, and Fortinet expects that such usage will only expand in the coming year.\n\nFor their part and the part of other cybersecurity vendors, they leverage AI for detecting danger patterns across whole swaths of network that manual monitoring just wouldn\u2019t be able to accomplish. Fortifying their software solutions is also helped along with AI tools.\n\nIt has always been an arms race between attackers and cybersecurity vendors. The difference here is that AI scales up the speed, efficiency, and frequency of attacks, necessitating vendors to make use of similar technologies to maintain defenses.\n\nAside from AI, here are the key trends to expect:\n\nMore attack chain expertise emerges. In recent years, attackers have provided \u201cjack of all trades\u201d cyber-attacks-as-a-service (CaaS) \u201coffering buyers everything needed to execute an attack, from phishing kits to payload.\u201d But Fortinet sees these providers increasingly embracing specialization \u201cwith many groups focusing on providing offerings that home in on just one segment of the attack chain.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn recent years, attackers have provided \u201cjack of all trades\u201d cyber-attacks-as-a-service (CaaS) \u201coffering buyers everything needed to execute an attack, from phishing kits to payload.\u201d But Fortinet sees these providers increasingly embracing specialization \u201cwith many groups focusing on providing offerings that home in on just one segment of the attack chain.\u201d Cloud-specific attacks to rise. While endpoint or edge devices like smartphones and computers continue to draw attention from attackers, the cloud is \u201cpiquing the interest\u201d of cyberattackers more so than in past years. \u201cGiven that most organizations rely on multiple cloud providers, it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019re observing more cloud-specific vulnerabilities being leveraged by attackers, anticipating that this trend will grow in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile endpoint or edge devices like smartphones and computers continue to draw attention from attackers, the cloud is \u201cpiquing the interest\u201d of cyberattackers more so than in past years. \u201cGiven that most organizations rely on multiple cloud providers, it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019re observing more cloud-specific vulnerabilities being leveraged by attackers, anticipating that this trend will grow in the future.\u201d Automated hacking tools make their way to dark web marketplace. \u201cWe anticipate that attackers will use the automated output from LLMs to power CaaS offerings and grow the market, such as taking social media reconnaissance and automating that intelligence into neatly packaged phishing kits,\u201d Fortinet said.

Threat groups are \u201cbecoming more aggressive and destructive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing some cybercrime groups physically threaten an organization\u2019s executives and employees in some instances and anticipate that this will become a regular part of many playbooks. We also anticipate that transnational crime \u2014 such as drug trafficking, smuggling people or goods, and more \u2014 will become a regular component of more sophisticated playbooks, with cybercrime groups and transnational crime organizations working together,\u201d Fortinet said.\n\nOn the positive end of things, the firm also expects that anti-adversary frameworks will expand, urging the cybersecurity community to pursue global collaborations, and private-public partnerships to keep up with evolving strategies of cybercriminals.\n\nRashish Pandey, VP, marketing and communications, said, \u201cAs cybercriminals continue to evolve their tactics, 2025 is poised to bring a new wave of highly specialized and AI-driven attacks\u2026Our predictions underscore the need for organizations to anticipate and adapt to an increasingly dynamic threat landscape.\u201d \u2013 Rappler.com"

            "article_content": "Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.\n\nAstronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.\n\nThe three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.\n\nBecause the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.\n\nWHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED\n\nThe team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.\n\nHis team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.\n\nThe team carried out their research focusing on the coldest regions of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or minus (-)257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide.\n\nCarbon Monoxide is key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY\n\nWhile scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and have also carried out research on binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique. The GG Tau A star system being located in our cosmic neighbourhood also helps answer key questions in astrophysics.\n\nIt helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravitational force of three host stars.\n\nGravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure, and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge as well as an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.\n\nTHE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE\n\nThe astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.\n\nThe facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.\n\nThe APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.\n\nThe ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n"

Then, in 2011, data from the Hubble Space Telescope suggested that distant galaxies were receding faster than predicted. Now, new observations from the James Webb Space Telescope appear to have confirmed those findings, suggesting that our model of the universe might be wrong.\n\nPhysicists, unusually, are desperate to find errors in their hypotheses: Relativity and quantum mechanics, the subject\u2019s main frameworks, are incredibly useful for predicting the world but are mutually incompatible, so finding an error in one or both could help unite the fields."

            "article_content": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nA mineral trapped within a Martian meteorite that fell to Earth has revealed traces of water on Mars that date back 4.45 billion years, according to new research. The zircon grain may contain the oldest direct evidence of ancient hot water on the red planet, which may have provided environments such as hot springs that are associated with life on Earth.\n\nThe discovery opens up new ways of understanding whether Mars was ever habitable in its ancient past. It also adds more support to observations already gathered by the fleet of spacecraft orbiting and roaming the red planet, which have spotted evidence of where rivers and lakes once existed on the Martian surface.\n\nBut key questions remain about when exactly water first appeared on Mars and how it evolved \u2014 and disappeared \u2014 over time.\n\nScientists analyzed a sample from the \u201cBlack Beauty\u201d meteorite, also known as NWA 7034, that was found in the Sahara Desert in 2011. The meteorite was ejected from the Martian surface after another celestial object hit the planet between 5 million and 10 million years ago, and fragments of it have served as a key source of studying ancient Mars for years.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Science Advances on November 22, focused on a single grain of the mineral zircon spotted within the meteorite. The team\u2019s analysis shows that water was present just 100 million years after the planet formed, which suggests that Mars may have been able to support life at some point in its history.\n\n\u201cOur data suggests the presence of water in the crust of Mars at a comparable time to the earliest evidence for water on Earth\u2019s surface, around 4.4 billion years ago,\u201d said lead study author Jack Gillespie, researcher at the University of Lausanne\u2019s Faculty of Geosciences and Environment in Switzerland, in a statement. \u201cThis discovery provides new evidence for understanding the planetary evolution of Mars, the processes that took place on it and its potential to have harboured life.\u201d\n\nMinerals as time capsules\n\nRocks may hold the answers to some of the biggest remaining questions about Mars, including how much water was present and whether life ever existed on the planet. That\u2019s why meteorites like Black Beauty are of such interest to scientists. Carl Agee, a professor and director of the Institute of Meteoritics at the University of New Mexico, first presented the space rock to the scientific community in 2013.\n\n\u201c(The Black Beauty meteorite) contains hundreds of rock and mineral fragments, each with a different part of the 4.5 billion years of Martian history,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Aaron Cavosie, a planetary scientist and senior lecturer the Space Science and Technology Centre at Curtin University, in an email. \u201c(It) is the only source of pieces for the geological puzzle of pre-Noachian Mars.\u201d\n\nThe Noachian period occurred from 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago, and little is known from direct measurements dating to the pre-Noachian period on Mars, between 4.5 billion and 4.1 billion years ago, though it\u2019s crucial to understand because it serves as the first page in the Mars history book, Cavosie said.\n\nBut Black Beauty has revealed some of its secrets. Many of the rock fragments the meteorite contains show that the Martian crust endured a number of impacts, causing a massive amount of upheaval on the planet\u2019s surface, he said.\n\nThe space rock also contains the oldest known pieces of Mars, including the oldest zircons, Cavosie said.\n\nZircon, used in products such as jewelry, ceramic tiles and medical implants, is a hardy mineral that can help scientists peer into the past and determine the conditions present when it crystallized, including the temperature at the time and whether the mineral interacted with water.\n\n\u201cZircon contains traces of uranium, an element that acts as a natural clock,\u201d said Gillespie, who was a postdoctoral research associate at Curtin University\u2019s School of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the time of the study. \u201cThis element decays to lead over time at a precisely known rate. By comparing the ratio of uranium to lead, we can calculate the age of crystal formation.\u201d\n\nThe zircon in Black Beauty was unaltered by its trip to Earth and fiery entrance into our planet\u2019s atmosphere before crashing down in the Sahara because it was protected by its location within the meteorite\u2019s interior, Cavosie said.\n\nDuring the analysis of the zircon grain, the study team detected unusual amounts of iron, sodium and aluminum, suggesting that water-rich fluids left these traces on the zircon as it formed 4.45 billion years ago. Such elements aren\u2019t usually found in crystalline zircon, but the researchers\u2019 atom-scale studies of the zircon showed the elements incorporated into the crystal structure and lined up like fruit stands in a market, Cavosie said.\n\n\u201cWe could tell by the patterns of how the (iron, aluminum and sodium) are found inside the zircon that they were incorporated into the grain as it grew, like layers in an onion,\u201d Cavosie said.\n\nOn Earth, zircons from hydrothermal systems \u2014 which form when water is heated by subsurface volcanic activity like the upward flow of hot magma \u2014 have similar patterns to those found in Black Beauty.\n\nIf hydrothermal systems existed in the Martian crust 4.45 billion years ago, liquid water likely made its way to the surface.\n\n\u201cOur experience on Earth shows that water is critical for habitats capable of supporting life,\u201d Cavosie said. \u201cMany environments on Earth host life in hot water systems, including hot springs, and hydrothermal vents. Such environments may have given rise to the earliest life forms on Earth. Our new study shows that the crust of Mars was warm and wet in the pre-Noachian period, meaning that habitable environments may have existed at that time.\u201d\n\nGetting up close with Mars\n\nCavosie is curious to determine whether hydrothermal systems like hot springs were prevalent when magma was helping form the red planet\u2019s crust between 4.48 billion and 4.43 billion years ago or if they were more episodic.\n\n\u201cIf hydrothermal systems were a stable feature on early Mars, it would indicate habitable conditions may have persisted over a considerable time span,\u201d Cavosie said. \u201cThis is now a testable hypothesis that can be addressed by collecting more data from Martian zircons.\u201d\n\nUntil samples can be returned directly from Mars, the Black Beauty meteorite is one of the best windows into how the Martian crust formed and what the early surface of Mars was like, said Briony Horgan, co-investigator on the Perseverance rover mission and professor of planetary science at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Horgan was not involved in this study.\n\nFinding evidence of hydrothermal systems within the subsurface from one tiny grain of zircon aligns with scientific theories on the amount of water and volcanic activity that existed on ancient Mars, she said. And these earliest potentially habitable environments would have been shielded from radiation by a strong planetary magnetic field, which Mars lacks today, Horgan added. Scientists are still trying to explain how the red planet lost its protective magnetic field.\n\nCurrently, the Perseverance rover is climbing the rim of Jezero Crater on Mars, an ancient lake once filled with water 3.7 billion years ago. Some of the rocks the rover has encountered may have been formed by hydrothermal systems, Horgan said.\n\nThe rover will take samples from the rocks because they could preserve evidence of ancient microbial life.\n\n\u201cAs much as the meteorites can tell us, we can do even better with a carefully selected and intact rock sample from a known location on Mars with good geologic context,\u201d Horgan said. \u201cSo this paper is a great motivation for bringing our Mars samples back to Earth to study with the same level of detail for years to come.\u201d"

He now runs xAI, an OpenAI competitor, and has emerged as a close advisor in Trump's transition team.\n\nTrump has chosen him, along with former Republican presidential candidate and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, to head a task force aimed at slashing government spending and regulations.\n\nFriar, who previously led social media firm Nextdoor and joined OpenAI six months ago as its first CFO, said the company has seen huge demand for its video generation tool Sora, which was released earlier this week.\n\nAccount creation has been suspended since then, and Friar didn't offer a specific timeline for when it would resume.\n\n\"Some of it is just we need capacity, but a lot of it is also we want to be measured...it's only available to a very small selection of people today, because we want to listen and learn,\" said Friar, adding the company is taking a different release approach for Sora from ChatGPT.\n\n\"There are places where we will go a little slower to make sure that we are constantly moving safety first as well.\"\n\nBesides video generation, she said she also anticipates more AI agent products that can handle day-to-day tasks to be released in the new year, with foundation models gaining better reasoning capabilities.\n\n\"I think we are going to see a lot of motion next year around agents, and I think people are going to be surprised at how fast this technology comes at us,\" she said.\n\nThe fast-growing startup is also working on developing a new dynamic with its largest investor and tech partner, Microsoft.\n\n\"We think about it ... in terms of helping each other grow, but also recognizing that diversification is a good thing as well, in terms of growing the whole industry,\" Friar added.\n\nDespite the controversy over its governance restructuring and the recent exodus of executives, OpenAI continues to experience rapid expansion, she said.\n\nFriar said the company sees a \"re-acceleration\" in ChatGPT user growth, which surged to 300 million weekly active users from 200 million in August this year, attributing it to the launch of new reasoning models such as o1.\n\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)"

He now runs xAI, an OpenAI competitor, and has emerged as a close advisor in Trump's transition team.\n\nTrump has chosen him, along with former Republican presidential candidate and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, to head a task force aimed at slashing government spending and regulations.\n\nFriar, who previously led social media firm Nextdoor and joined OpenAI six months ago as its first CFO, said the company has seen huge demand for its video generation tool Sora, which was released earlier this week.\n\nAccount creation has been suspended since then, and Friar didn't offer a specific timeline for when it would resume.\n\n\"Some of it is just we need capacity, but a lot of it is also we want to be measured...it's only available to a very small selection of people today, because we want to listen and learn,\" said Friar, adding the company is taking a different release approach for Sora from ChatGPT.\n\n\"There are places where we will go a little slower to make sure that we are constantly moving safety first as well.\"\n\nBesides video generation, she said she also anticipates more AI agent products that can handle day-to-day tasks to be released in the new year, with foundation models gaining better reasoning capabilities.\n\n\"I think we are going to see a lot of motion next year around agents, and I think people are going to be surprised at how fast this technology comes at us,\" she said.\n\nThe fast-growing startup is also working on developing a new dynamic with its largest investor and tech partner, Microsoft.\n\n\"We think about it ... in terms of helping each other grow, but also recognizing that diversification is a good thing as well, in terms of growing the whole industry,\" Friar added.\n\nDespite the controversy over its governance restructuring and the recent exodus of executives, OpenAI continues to experience rapid expansion, she said.\n\nFriar said the company sees a \"re-acceleration\" in ChatGPT user growth, which surged to 300 million weekly active users from 200 million in August this year, attributing it to the launch of new reasoning models such as o1."

Schematic illustration of selected brain connections that have been linked to intelligence differences across studies. Adapted from Hilger & Sporns, 2021. Credit: Thiele et al.\n\nAI can predict human intelligence by looking at the connections of a working human brain. Neuroscientists can predict intelligence from brain structure and function\u2014to a point. Previous studies have suggested that intelligence is widely distributed across the brain.\n\nKirsten Hilger and colleagues used machine learning models to predict multiple kinds of intelligence from brain connections of 806 healthy adults while resting and while completing tasks. The article is published in PNAS Nexus.\n\nFluid intelligence includes inductive and deductive reasoning abilities that do not rely on context, while crystallized intelligence reflects the ability to apply knowledge from individual experience and culture. General intelligence captures both types of intelligence.\n\nThe prediction performance of the model developed by Hilger and colleagues was highest for general intelligence, followed by crystallized intelligence, and then fluid intelligence. Cognitively demanding tasks produced the most accurate predictions.\n\nInterestingly, models trained with connections between brain regions proposed in most popular neurocognitive intelligence theories outperformed models trained with the same number of connections between randomly chosen regions, which empirically supports these theories.\n\nAccording to the authors, theory-driven models were outperformed by whole-brain models, indicating that there are still more aspects of intelligence waiting to be understood.\n\nMore information: Jonas A Thiele et al.

File photo by Nabil Mounzer/EPA-EFE\n\nBEIRUT, Lebanon, Dec. 10 (UPI) -- The World Bank said Tuesday that the Israel-Hezbollah conflict has dealt another significant blow to Lebanon's already struggling economy and emphasized the pressing need for extensive reforms and targeted investments. The international organization noted in a statement that Lebanon's economic contraction deepened because of the conflict that started in October 2023 when Hezbollah opened \"a support front\" for Gaza. Advertisement\n\nThe conflict turned into a devastating war with Israel expanding its attacks on Sept. 17, destroying Hezbollah's military and civilian infrastructure and assassinating its leader and top officials and military commanders.\n\nThe relentless Israeli air and ground bombardment led to widespread destruction of villages, property, hospitals and schools in Beirut's southern suburbs and in southern and eastern Lebanon. It also forced the displacement of more than 1.2 million people, who fled the targeted areas to more secure regions across Lebanon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA U.S,-brokered cease-fire agreement came into effect Sept. 27, ending the 14-month war that killed more than 4,000 people and wounded 16,600. However, Israel continues its targeted attacks mainly on southern Lebanon, inflicting more casualties and damage.\n\nThe World Bank statement said the deepening economic downturn \"reflects the severe consequences of widespread displacement, destruction and reduced private consumption,\" and emphasizes the necessity for comprehensive reforms and targeted investments in critical sectors as \"the only viable way forward\" after the conflict.\n\nThe country's real gross domestic product growth has been cut by an estimated 6.6% in 2024, bringing the cumulative decline in real GDP since 2019 to more than 38% by the end of the year, the World Bank said, projecting economic activity to contract by 5.7% in 2024 -- equivalent to a loss of $4.2 billion in consumption and net exports.\n\nGDP would have grown, albeit tepidly, by an estimated 0.9% in 2024 if the conflict had not broken out.\n\nLast month, the World Bank put Lebanon's physical damage and economic losses from Hezbollah-Israel war at some $8.5 billion.\n\nJean-Christophe Carret, the World Bank Middle East country director, said the conflict has inflicted yet \"another major shock\" to Lebanon's economy already in a severe crisis\" and highlighted the urgent need for comprehensive reforms and targeted investments \"to avoid further delays in addressing long standing development priorities.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"As Lebanon embarks on developing its post conflict recovery and reconstruction plan, an economic stabilization program and an ambitious program of reforms that strengthen governance will be critical to attract the financing needed to put the country on a sustainable long-term recovery path,\" Carret said.\n\nThe World Bank statement warned that Lebanon's fiscal position is likely to deteriorate further due to \"rising financing needs to secure essential services and meet urgent demands, compounded by potentially reduced fiscal revenue.\"\n\nComprehensive debt restructuring, it said, is critical to regain access to international capital markets to enable the country to tackle its multifaceted challenges.\n\nAchieving macroeconomic stability, improving governance, enhancing public utilities and bolstering human capital remain key priorities. Targeted investments are critical to support sustainable reforms, facilitate the recovery of essential services and rebuild Lebanon's damaged capital stock, the World Bank noted.\n\nLebanon has been facing a deep, compounded crisis since October 2019 that resulted in soaring poverty and unemployment, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value and most of its sectors struggling."

As of Tuesday midday, 16 bodies had been recovered, he said. \u201cResidents of the area are still trying to extract the rest of the dead, about 10 people, including women and children,\u201d Basal added.\n\nPhotos posted online, which The Washington Post was not able to verify, showed more than a dozen bodies wrapped in blankets being buried in a mass grave.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said Tuesday that at least 28 people have been killed and 54 others injured in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours. The Health Ministry records casualties that reach hospitals, but the enclave\u2019s medical system has collapsed, and rescue workers say many dead and injured go uncounted. More than 44,700 Palestinians have been killed in the 14-month-long war, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says most of the dead are women and children.\n\nSince early October, Israeli forces have encircled Gaza\u2019s northernmost border communities \u2014 Jabalya, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun \u2014 bombarded the areas and forced tens of thousands of residents to flee. The IDF said it is targeting regrouping Hamas militants.\n\nBasal told The Post by WhatsApp that the ongoing northern operation has killed about 3,700 people \u201cbetween those who were buried in the streets and those whose fate is still unknown and who remain under the rubble and are missing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no rescue teams, no medical crews, no Civil Defense, and no health [care],\u201d he added. The Civil Defense said in late October it could no longer safely operate in the areas due to Israeli strikes on its crews and equipment.\n\nThe IDF said Monday that Hamas fighters killed three Israeli soldiers and injured 12 others in an attack in northern Gaza. Israeli media reported that the forces were preparing to leave Jabalya. The IDF said in a statement Tuesday that it \u201celiminated ten terrorists\u201d who took part in the attack but did not specify where they were killed. An IDF spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs the war grinds into its 14 month, there are signs of progress toward a ceasefire and Israeli hostage-release deal. Though previous rounds mediated by Egypt and Qatar and backed by the United States have broken down, the latest proposal being considered by Israeli and Palestinian officials calls for an initial 60-day ceasefire similar to the deal last month that ended fighting between Israel and Lebanon."

The ability for AI-driven software and systems to become more efficient at their assigned tasks, as well as evolve to learn new skills over time, gives this game-changing technology a virtually limitless ceiling.\n\nDespite an awe-inspiring addressable market of $15.7 trillion by 2030, based on estimates from PwC in Sizing the Prize, not all Wall Street analysts are necessarily bullish on the companies leading the AI charge. Keeping in mind that analyst price targets are fluid and often reactive rather than proactive, two seemingly unstoppable AI stocks can plunge by up to 94% in 2025, based on the price targets of select Wall Street analysts.\n\nAre You Missing The Morning Scoop?

These outsized returns are a function of its AI-driven Gotham platform and AI- and machine learning-powered Foundry platform, being unique at scale.\n\nGotham is a service that federal governments use for mission planning and execution, as well as gathering data. Since these contracts typically stretch for four or five years and are with the U.S. government and its immediate allies, Palantir is able to generate predictable operating cash flow, with little concerns about being paid.\n\nMeanwhile, Foundry is geared at helping businesses better understand their data in order to streamline their operations and improve profitability. This segment is still very early in its expansion, with Foundry's commercial customer count rocketing higher by 51% to 498 during the September-ended quarter from the prior-year period.\n\nYet in spite of this seemingly perfect positioning for Palantir, RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria believes shares of the company are worth (drum roll) $9, which would represent an astounding 88% decline from where shares closed on Dec. 6. Said Jaluria in a recent investor note,\n\nWe cannot rationalize why Palantir is the most expensive name in software... Absent a substantial beat-and-raise quarter elevating the near-term growth trajectory, valuation seems unsustainable.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "The Meta Quest 3 is confidently the best VR headset out there right now but a report suggests it may cede its top spot to other headset manufacturers while allowing them to use its OS and store.\n\nA report was recent published by The Information (via OC3D) citing an employee at Goertek, the Chinese manufacturer who produces and tests Quests, and two employees at Meta. In this, it is claimed Meta hopes that Goertek and other manufacturers will take on a bigger role in designing and creating headsets by 2030, potentially fully developing them.\n\nTaking a step back from production is said to be a way to allow Meta to focus on software, which is a much more profitable section of the business.\n\nOften times, hardware, specifically cheap and accessible hardware like Meta's budget headset are sold at a loss or barely breaking even, in order to make money back on the software.\n\nWe've seen time and time again the massive costs of Meta's VR and AR division, Reality Labs. It has often spent upwards of a billion dollars per month.\n\nInstead of putting out headsets, Meta could essentially loan the use of its OS and Meta Quest storefront for non-Meta headsets to use.\n\nOf course, coming from just a handful of employees, it's important to note that plans for moving hardware manufacturing away from Meta itself is reported for some time in the future. Meta could always change course over the next few years, especially as the VR market continues to develop.\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nHaving just bought a Meta Quest 3 myself, one of the things I'm most pleasantly surprised by is how intuitive that OS is. Everything slots together well and is easy to explore. The idea of Meta essentially loaning its software doesn't seem like a bad idea in theory, especially when it's one of the few things holding back rivals like the Pico 4 Ultra.\n\nNot only does Meta have a big install base but its OS has wider brand recognisability, which is part of why Android is popular today. An Android user can easily swap to almost any Android phone with little problems, which makes it easier for new names to enter the market.\n\nThis is all before mentioning the rather stellar section of titles available on the Meta storefront. Throw in a Meta Quest + Subscription, and access to some of the bigger titles like Asgard's Wrath 2 and Batman Arkham Shadow, and you have an impressive selection to play through.\n\nIn that same article, The Information's report says that Meta is aiming move up to half of the production of its headset to Vietnam, diversifying what has otherwise been predominantly Chinese manufacturing.\n\nThis appears to be an effort to avoid the huge penalties on Chinese imports that will come as a result of the tariffs, proposed by soon-to-be president Donald Trump.\n\nVirtual reality (Image credit: Valve) Best VR headset: which kit should you choose?\n\nBest graphics card: you need serious GPU power for VR\n\nBest gaming laptop: don't get tied to your desktop in VR\n\nThat production change from China to Vietnam being assisted by Goertek is a further strengthening of Meta's relationship with the Chinese manufacturing company, and one that signals that grander business plan, according to the previously mentioned employees.\n\nAs of right now, Goertek is an essential part of the production and testing of Meta Quest headsets but Meta is said to be encouraging Goertek to also work on designing components like lenses and displays.\n\nMeta has cemented a name for itself in the VR market with great well-priced hardware and it might actually see a greater return on all that digital real estate in the next decade."

The base variants of the Nexon and Punch, which currently have starting prices of Rs 8.00 lakh and Rs 6.13 lakh (ex-showroom), respectively, are expected to see their prices rise to Rs 8.24 lakh and Rs 6.31 lakh following the hike.\n\nThis price increase comes amid slowing demand in the auto industry, which has prompted automakers to offer higher discounts and moderate dealer sales.\n\nTata Motors\u2019 recent performance and industry trends\n\nDespite the price hike announcement, Tata Motors has faced challenges in recent months. Over the last three months, the stock has been one of the worst performers among all major four-wheeler manufacturers, losing more than 22 per cent. In comparison, the broader auto sector has also been grappling with rising input costs and sluggish demand following a period of strong growth.\n\nThe price hikes are not unique to Tata Motors. Maruti Suzuki, the country's largest car manufacturer, also announced a 4 per cent price hike starting January 2025 to counter rising input costs. Hyundai Motor India is following suit with price increases across all models, including the Venue, Creta, and Ioniq 5 EV, along with plans to launch the Creta EV next year.\n\nLuxury carmakers, including Audi, BMW, Mini, and Mercedes-Benz, are also expected to implement price hikes in the new year, reflecting a broader trend across the global auto industry to pass on the rising manufacturing and logistical costs to consumers.\n\nTata Motors' shares traded at Rs 807, marking a 1.13 per cent increase as of 10:00 am, signalling a positive response to the price hike despite ongoing industry pressures."

            "article_content": "Australia Post\u2019s new point-of-sale platform has been beset by multiple technical troubles, including outages and missing transactions, since its launch last year.\n\nThe cloud-based point-of-sale platform, known as POST+, is intended to replace Australia Post\u2019s 30-year-old legacy EPOS system.\n\nHowever, since its staggered roll-out began last December, licence holders operating Australia Post branches have regularly complained about till shortfalls, disappearing transactions and system shutdowns -- the longest of which reportedly lasted 90 minutes.\n\nAlthough complaints were regularly escalated with Australia Post\u2019s internal IT helpdesk, the organisation appears to have been at a loss as to the root cause of the issues.\n\niTnews has seen correspondence that shows complaints were raised about POST+, as far back as January.\n\nIn addition to failing transactions, complaints also concerned POST+\u2019s inconsistent interface and usability; its incomplete, slow and convoluted reporting process and poor observability functionality.\n\niTnews understands that Australia Post brought in Deloitte to carry out a technical two-month review of the issues.\n\nIn particular, Deloitte was tasked with uncovering potential errors between POST+\u2019s frontend software and its backend cloud architecture, to pinpoint performance bottlenecks in the end-to-end transaction process.\n\nDeloitte is also understood to have looked at whether POST+\u2019s architecture is consistent with accepted best-practice standards.\n\nThe outcome of this review, which was due to have been completed in July, remains unclear.\n\nAn Australia Post spokesperson said in a statement that \"the system has been independently audited and is fit for purpose.\"\n\n'Teething problems'\n\nAccording to the Licensed Post Office Group, which represents the interests of 2800 licensees operating under Australia Post\u2019s franchise model, the new system is causing a \u201csignificant financial burden\u201d to licensees.\n\n\u201cWe have evidence that transactions have been missing, or just not completed, for almost 12 months,\u201d said LPO Group executive director Angela Cramp.\n\n\u201cThe evidence was gathered due to a number of outlets being continually short in their balance, and they began to print off transaction history reports more often so they had a paper trail when they experienced shortages.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cramp, the alleged 90-minute outage, which occurred in May, collectively cost licensees $200,000 in lost revenue and downtime.\n\nFranchisees of Australia Post, which make up two-thirds of Australia Post\u2019s overall network, are remunerated on the number of \u201ctasks\u201d they process, such as banking sales and bill payments. As such, if a transaction fails to complete, the licensees are not paid.\n\niTnews understands that licensees were told by the Australia Post IT helpdesk to make up any shortfalls with their own money, as per the process under the former EPOS system.\n\nHowever, when questioned in a recent senate estimates hearing, Australia Post CEO Paul Graham strongly denied any suggestion that licensees were asked to pick up the shortfalls.\n\n\u201cWe do not ask the post offices to put money back in to balance it out,\u201d he said in response to questions about POST+ from Senator Malcolm Roberts.\n\n\"What we did was provide a report for all those transactions that had not processed through.\u201d\n\nGraham added that POST+ is a modern system built on \u201cstate-of-the-art architecture\u201d and described the complaints as coming from a \"minority\" of people.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that when you implement a brand-new system at the scale we\u2019ve implemented it, there will be teething problems,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, as of this month, iTnews understands that bugs affecting cashflow and reconciliation continue to be uncovered.\n\niTnews asked Australia Post a detailed set of questions about the issues.\n\nIn response a spokesperson said: \"Australia Post has introduced a modern, new point of sale system called POST+ to replace its aging 30-year-old system. It is providing a better experience for team members and customers as well as enhanced transaction security.\n\n\"We involved many stakeholders, including licensees and post office team members, at all major stages of the design and implementation. This collaboration has continued including fortnightly meetings with licensees from across the country who are using POST+ in their outlets.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added that the system was independently reviewed and audited, during roll-out and post implementation and found fit for purpose.\n\n\"We are constantly investing in the system and developing enhancements collaboratively with our team members, including licensees,\" the spokesperson said."

            "article_content": "New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has offered yet another conspiracy theory on the extra-terrestrial.\n\nNow that the Jets are officially out of the playoffs with a 3-10 record, the 41-year-old has seemingly begun to divert his energy elsewhere.\n\nAfter failing to end New York's 14-year playoff curse, Rodgers opted to debunk some conspiracy theories during his weekly Pat McAfee Show appearance instead.\n\nThe signal caller brought up some mysterious drone activity that has been occurring in the skies of New Jersey recently.\n\n'Do you know what's been going on in New Jersey lately? And I'm not talking about the football. There's been some crazy things going on,' Rodgers began. 'There's been some drones in the sky in Jersey.'\n\nMcAfee then showed a clip on an unidentified large object hovering above Bedminster, New Jersey with blue, green and red flashing lights.\n\nAaron Rodgers has offered yet another conspiracy theory on the extra-terrestrial\n\nThe Jets quarterback discussed mysterious drone activity above New Jersey on Pat McAfee\n\n'What the hell is that?' Rodgers continued, before highlighting that the mysterious sighting came above Bedminster where both president-elect Donald Trump owns a golf course and Jets owner Woody Johnson lives.\n\nThe four-time MVP did admit it could be Trump flying in for a quick round of golf but, of course, it wouldn't be Aaron Rodgers without a conspiracy theory.\n\n'Maybe it's some kids messing around\u2026maybe not, though,' he hinted.\n\n'I'm thinking about having a Friday night 5E experience,' he added, leaving the panel bewildered.\n\n'It's where you have a big kind of meditation circle and then you call in the aliens and you use little green lasers to bring them in,' the NFL veteran explained.\n\nIt wasn't the first time that the former Super Bowl winner has discussed extra-terrestrial experiences.\n\nDuring last season's 'Hard Knocks' series focusing on the Jets, Rodgers claimed he experienced a UFO sighting in 2005.\n\nHe said he was at former Cal teammate Steve Levy's house in New Jersey shortly before he was taken by the Green Bay Packers in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft when the sighting occurred.\n\nThe 41-year-old has previously opened up on an experience with a UFO sighting\n\nThe Jets are officially out of the playoffs with a 3-10 record, following last week's slate\n\nRodgers, who has publicly admitted to using hallucinogen ayahuasca, said he was trying to sleep as he had a 5am wake up call the following day but was disturbed by an 'alarm going off in the distance.'\n\n'It just didn't seem like normal, and I heard some rustling downstairs,' Rodgers said on the season finale of 'Hard Knocks.'\n\n'So I got up, walk downstairs, it's a beautiful night, and [we] walked outside, and up in the clouds, we heard this sound, and we saw this tremendously large object moving through the sky. And it was like a scene out of \"Independence Day\" when the ships are coming into the atmosphere, and they're creating this, like, kind of explosion-type fire in the sky.\n\n'We saw this incredibly large object and froze, as anybody would, because, you know, what the hell is going on? Eventually, it went out of sight, and nobody said a word. We just stood frozen.\n\n'And about 30 seconds later we heard the real, recognizable sound of fighter jets that seemed to be chasing this object. Again, we just stood there in disbelief for another few minutes and nobody said a word. And we just looked at each other like, 'did we just see what we think we just saw?'\n\nRodgers said he checked the papers and watched the news in the following days but nothing was mentioned.\n\nHowever, the experience piqued his interest in UFOs, leading him to do more research into them.\n\nRodgers later discovered that the siren was from a nuclear plant around nine miles away and claimed that UFOs are often linked to nuclear energy.\n\nThe Jets quarterback is known for his outlandish theories and techniques opening up on his use of ayahuasca at the start of last season, claiming it helped him to his back-to-back MVP seasons in 2020 and 2021.\n\nHe also underwent a darkness retreat shortly after the end of the 2022 season to contemplate his NFL future."

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has for years been railing against the concept of birthright citizenship in the 14th Amendment.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, he promised that, on Day One of his second term, he would issue an executive order ending the current policy, which he said in a video is \u201cbased on a historical myth and a willful misinterpretation of the law.\u201d\n\nA constitutional amendment beats an executive order every time in the US system of government, but Trump\u2019s position represents the persistent belief that something should be done to stop the children of undocumented immigrants from claiming US citizenship.\n\nHow might Trump challenge birthright citizenship?\n\nIn that campaign video, Trump said his executive order will make \u201cclear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward, the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic US citizenship.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez has reported that Trump\u2019s new administration could stop issuing passports to the children of the undocumented, engineering a legal showdown over the issue. In addition, Trump\u2019s team might step up \u201cexpedited removal\u201d of undocumented immigrants across the country without a court hearing, challenging another sentence of the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection to every person under the law.\n\nBoth Trump and his incoming \u201cborder czar,\u201d Tom Homan, have said they will not shy away from deporting the parents of US citizens who are children.\n\n\u201cIf you come in the country and have a child, that\u2019s on you. You can either take the child with you, but that\u2019s on you,\u201d Homan said on Tuesday in Chicago, adding he would target undocumented people living in cities like Chicago that have sanctuary policies.\n\nAs president in 2020, Trump tried to restrict visas for pregnant women entering the US for so-called birth tourism.\n\nWhy does the US have birthright citizenship?\n\nThe US has birthright citizenship to guarantee that the descendants of people brought to the US against their will and sold as slaves are citizens.\n\nIn probably the worst moment in the US Supreme Court\u2019s history, the Dred Scott decision of 1857, then-Chief Justice Roger B. Taney wrote for a 7-2 majority that no descendant of an enslaved person could be a US citizen. Scott was an enslaved man from Missouri who had lived in free territories with his Army surgeon owner. He sued for freedom after returning to Missouri.\n\nThe decision was undone by the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, and the 14th Amendment, which guaranteed that everyone born in the US was a citizen of the US and protected by its Bill of Rights.\n\nWhat does the 14th Amendment say?\n\nHere\u2019s the text of the first portion of the amendment:\n\nThe language is pretty clear. Anyone born in the US is a citizen of the US.\n\nFor more on the history of the amendment, read this excellent explainer from CNN\u2019s AJ Willingham, written in 2018, when Trump threatened as president to challenge the concept of birthright citizenship.\n\nThe 14th Amendment was passed by Congress on June 13, 1866, and ratified on July 9, 1868. - National Archives\n\nHow could the 14th Amendment not apply to the children of the undocumented?\n\nOne of the main backers of the idea that the amendment does not apply to children of undocumented immigrants born in the US is John Eastman, the very same lawyer who hatched the six-step game plan by which Trump attempted to subvert the 2020 election results.\n\nWhile Trump is returning to the White House, Eastman has since been indicted in Georgia and Arizona for election interference and disbarred in California. But before any of that, he was pushing the idea that the country has been misinterpreting the 14th Amendment for the past 150-plus years.\n\nHe argued that the phrase in between the commas, \u201cand subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\u201d essentially disqualifies the children of people not legally living in the US. All it would take is for Congress to pass a law expressly saying the children of people in the country illegally cannot have citizenship, according to Eastman and some other scholars.\n\nIt\u2019s a fringe theory in that even conservative lawyers and judges have rejected it.\n\nJudge invites new \u2018invasion\u2019 theory\n\nFor more on why Eastman\u2019s argument does not apply, look to James Ho, now a Trump-appointed judge on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Ho wrote in 2006 that the 14th Amendment was enacted expressly to undo the Dred Scott decision and return the US to principles of English common law, by which everyone born in the country was a citizen.\n\nNote: The United Kingdom actually did away with unrestricted birthright citizenship with its British Nationality Act of 1981, but many other countries, including Canada and Mexico on either side of the US, still adhere to the principle.\n\nHo, a potential contender for a Supreme Court seat if one opens up during Trump\u2019s new term, raised many eyebrows when he was interviewed by the libertarian Reason magazine in November. Without commenting on any specific cases, he added a qualification to his legal support for birthright citizenship. Ho said this:\n\nEarlier this year, coincidentally, CNN\u2019s John Fritze notes that Ho had used that term, \u201cinvasion,\u201d in a concurring opinion on a different topic.\n\n\u201cIn an opinion this summer dealing with Texas\u2019 construction of a floating barrier on the Rio Grande, Ho wrote that Texas should have prevailed in the case because the state was repelling an \u2018invasion\u2019 of migrants,\u201d according to Fritze.\n\nWith the Tajumulco Volcano in the background, migrants walk along the Huixtla highway, in southern Mexico, on November 6, hoping to reach the country's northern border and ultimately the US. - Moises Castillo/AP\n\nHas the Supreme Court ever ruled on this?\n\nThe Supreme Court did unequivocally find in the case of Wong Kim Ark in 1898 that the children of noncitizens born in the US to \u201cresident aliens\u201d are citizens under the 14th Amendment.\n\nWong Kim Ark was born in the US to Chinese immigrants but denied entry back into the country after a trip to China due to the Chinese Exclusion Act. Ho described the circumstances of that case in his 2006 defense of birthright citizenship. He included this sweeping language confirming the principle of birthright citizenship from the 1898 court:\n\nAt the time, Ho argued that the decision extended citizenship to people born in the US regardless of immigration status.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Trump just change the Constitution?\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a constitutional amendment ratified in more than 30 years. They\u2019re notoriously hard to enact. They can either be proposed by a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers of Congress or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the states. The amendment must then also be ratified by three-quarters of state legislatures or of special conventions called in each state.\n\nIf talk of Trump and the 14th Amendment sounds familiar, that\u2019s because a different section of the amendment bars people who engaged in or aided insurrection against the US from serving in federal office. The Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that the insurrection clause could only be applied to Trump by an act of Congress, clearing the way for his appearance on ballots this fall.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

            "article_content": "An email containing incredible UFO images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked online by an anonymous source.\n\nThe leaker claimed that they had accessed an alleged top secret UFO 'data retrieval program' known as 'Immaculate Constellation' \u2014 made famous this past November in a blockbuster public hearing before Congress.\n\nThe black-and-white images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube, traditional flying saucers and several other craft that look straight out of classic science fiction.\n\nThe screengrabs are said to be from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by military 'heads up displays,' but details were redacted to protect both sensitive US national security interests.\n\nThese unsettling depictions of highly varied craft were first made public by Nathan Latvaitis, who runs a YouTube channel called 'Strange Mysteries.'\n\n'This person has asked me to redact their email address,' Latvaitis told his followers, 'although I can tell you that there is nothing identifiable in it.'\n\nThe sensational images have elicited heated debate among UFO believers and skeptics alike, however, with many on both sides questioning the leaker's story.\n\nA 'creepy e-mail' containing weird, but compelling images allegedly from US military UFO sightings has been leaked by an anonymous source claiming classified access\n\nThe UFO stills are said to be screengrabs from infrared and thermal camera footage taken by US military sensors with key 'heads up display' details redacted (as seen above) to protect both sensitive America's national security interests as well as the leaker's identity\n\nOver the course of two weeks of correspondence with the leaker, Latvaitis and his followers given tantalizing, but uncorroborated details on the craft depicted.\n\n'The UAPs observed demonstrate capabilities far beyond conventional aerospace benchmarks,' the leaker said in a third update posted to YouTube on November 30th.\n\nThe so-called 'cruciform' (cross-shaped) entities, according to their account, exhibit aggressive maneuvers and high-energy emissions capable of disabling systems such as the EODAS' \u2014 a reference to the advanced sensors on the F-35 stealth fighter jet.\n\nShort for 'Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System,' EODAS is a sensor suite that give the F-35's stealth fighter pilots a 360-degree view for a 'quick, high-definition picture of everything around them,' according its manufacturer Raytheon.\n\nImproved 'missile detection' is one key goal in making EODAS, even though it may prove helpless against these purported 'cruciform' UFOs.\n\n'The 'cruciform' entity [shows] distinct behaviors indicating functional differences,' according to the self-described insider to the Immaculate Constellation program.\n\n'Shape-shifting has been observed \u2014 possibly due to advanced cloaking or optical refraction \u2014 referred to as 'morphogenic behavior,' allowing for adaptation to environments or missions,' the leaker continued.\n\nDetails were scarce on some other craft shapes, though the leaker noted nearly all 'these crafts,' like the boomerang UFOs, squares, and classic saucers 'demonstrate trans-medium travel, non-ballistic motion, and localized gravity manipulation.'\n\nAbove, an ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFO, allegedly captured by a US military plane\n\nThe stunning, unusual images show ornately spiked 'cruciform' UFOs, boomerang-shaped flying wings, a floating 'hot' cube and several craft that looks straight out of science fiction\n\nAbove, another cruciform (cross-shaped) UFO from the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nWhile many of these UFOs emit electromagnetic 'signatures that disrupt ISR [intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance] systems causing sensor malfunctions' on human-made systems, they said, one broad category was less disruptive.\n\n''Orb'-class UAPs focus on surveillance with minimal EMF [electro-magnetic frequency] interference,' according to the leaker.\n\nSpeaking to NASA last year, ex-CIA physicist Dr Sean Kirkpatrick, then head of the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), said: 'We see these ['metallic orbs'] all over the world.'\n\nDr Kirkpatrick, a career laser and optical physicist, called these orbs the most commonly reported type of UFO to AARO's team.\n\n'And we see these making very interesting apparent maneuvers,' he added.\n\nBut 'cruciform' UFO shapes were not called out by name in his report to NASA, which did note that seven percent of sightings fell into miscellaneous 'other' shapes.\n\nIn his email to Latvaitis, the leaker asserted that he selected the YouTuber over more mainstream journalism outlets specifically to avoid having to verify his own claims.\n\n'Many traditional media outlets would require verification of my identity and credentials,' the leaker told Latvaitis in his email, shown in a Strange Mysteries video.\n\nAbove a boomerang UFO included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nTwo cross-shaped UFOs as alleged by the leaker, in the crosshairs of a military aircraft\n\n'This is not feasible due to the risks involved,' the leaked explained. '[Those news media] organizations, despite their best intentions, are not equipped to handle the level of secrecy and potential retaliation associated with this information.'\n\nThe leaker described their motives as desire to inform on important information that has been 'classified and intentionally withheld from the public regarding 'unidentified aerial phenomena' [UAP] and the ongoing covert operations surrounding them.'\n\n'I was part of one of the legacy programs,' the leaker wrote. 'I know that's vague, but unfortunately that's all I can offer at this point.'\n\nMultiple UFO 'true believers' on social media expressed doubt over the leakers story, particularly the unknown individuals response to that skepticism.\n\nOne UFO has been dubbed the ceiling fan, in part, by skeptics who believe that the image depicts a genuine household ceiling fan - and not a five-bladed advanced aerospace platform\n\nAbove, a strange 'hot cube' UFO image included in the leaker's email to Strange Mysteries\n\nThe mixed orientation of some images suggested 'they were probably scanned from a print out,' and the images varied in terms of their 'detailed sensor noise' and subtle software response to motion blur.\n\n'In my opinion, this has the variety I would expect to see from a collection of images captured on different platforms over the years,' the user posted to Reddit's r/UFOs.\n\nOn the skeptics' forum Metabunk many dismissed the videos as too low information to properly vet or investigate, with some claiming it might have been release as a premeditated disinformation effort.\n\n'Not worth wasting time on unless they can (and do!) back up their story,' one typical comment read.\n\n'It takes seconds to make another picture and hours to try and debunk it.'\n\nThe 'Immaculate Constellation' program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November 2024 and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public. Above a still from the alleged new leak\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs (second at right)\n\nBut whistleblowers continue to claim that 'Immaculate Constellation' was, in fact, established to 'detect' and 'quarantine' the military's best UFO imagery, as well as its best videos, eyewitness testimonies and electronic sensor evidence.\n\nThis high quality, multi-sensor UFO data, according to a US official who confirmed the leak, is so tightly held that 'talking about it will put you in the danger zone.'\n\nThe quite literally 'above top secret' program allegedly sprang into action in the wake of the 2017 leak of three, still-as-yet unexplained US Navy infrared UFO videos, although it is still unconfirmed, resting the gray area of speculation.\n\nThe program was discussed at a Congressional hearing about UAPs in mid-November and shortly after, Representative Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made the 11-page document available to the public.\n\nMichael Shellenberger, journalist and sworn witness at the hearing, told the House that Immaculate Constellation has thousands of 'high-resolution' images of UFOs.\n\nAbove, two additional alleged UFO images that the leaker to Strange Mysteries said came from Immaculate Constellation\n\nIn one stunning case, detailed in the 11-page report, infrared satellites captured a massive saucer-shaped UFO emerging from within a dense cloud formation.\n\nThe saucer's circumference was estimated to be between 650 and 1,300 feet, which would place its diameter between roughly 200 and 400 feet.\n\nIt also 'displayed symmetrical concavities on the upper surface,' the report reads.\n\nThe saucer registered hot in the infrared footage, and created visible 'atmospheric disturbances.'\n\nThe object emerged from the cloud formation at a shallow angle and travelled upwards toward the outer atmosphere."

Smith recalls being told at the time by Admiral William James Crowe Jr., the joint chiefs of staff chairman for presidents Ronald Reagan and H.W. Bush, that nobody ever thought those locations would be targeted by terrorists. Requests for beefed-up security went unheeded by the Clinton Administration before the attacks, according to Smith.\n\nSmith ticked off the number of military facilities in New Jersey at risk including Naval Weapons Station Earle in Colts Neck, the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, the Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, a decommissioned nuclear waste site near Berkeley, U.S Coast Guard stations plus National Guard training facilities.\n\n\"We have to treat this with a presumption of potential hostile threat. You gotta presume. You don't sit there and say, 'well, it'll be OK.' No, it won't be and I learned that lesson during those bombings,\" Smith said.\n\nSmith said Murphy could also be doing more in his communication with the federal government.\n\n\"I think he needs to demand that the Biden administration and the Secretary of Defense need to make this a priority right now. Don't just say Homeland Security is handling it,\" Smith said.\n\nREAD ON: Weird, wild UFO sightings from throughout history\n\nReport a correction \ud83d\udc48 | \ud83d\udc49 Contact our newsroom\n\n8 of the best pizza places in Central Jersey Gallery Credit: Kyle Clark"

            "article_content": "Astronomers from India have made an intriguing discovery in a unique tri-star solar system located 489 light years from Earth. The discovery will help astrophysicists get a better understanding of planetary formations.\n\nAstronomers from the National Institute of Science Education and Research or NISER in Odisha have made the discovery using the advanced radio telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert. Their observations, sustained over a period of time, reveal fascinating insights into the complexities of planetary formation.\n\nThe three-star system that was being observed was the 'GG Tau A' solar system which is in its nascent stage of planetary formations. The system is believed to be around 5 million years old. What makes it unique is that there are three 'Suns' with a massive protoplanetary disk - a rotating disk of gas and dust that forms around a young star and provides the materials for new planets to form.\n\nBecause the three stars orbit each other, the giant ring of gas and dust, which over time will form planets, get significantly altered due to the gravity of the stars in their orbiting pattern, giving scientists fascinating insights.\n\nWHAT THE INDIAN ASTRONOMERS HAVE DISCOVERED\n\nThe team of astronomers from NISER was led by scientist Liton Majumdar, who is also a visiting scientist at NASA. His area of specialisation is star and planetary formations, astrochemistry, and exoplanet studies.\n\nHis team and he have detected molecular emissions from the protoplanetary disk which are the fundamental building blocks of planets. These emissions were found to originate in the coldest and most dense regions of the star system.\n\nThe team carried out their research focusing on the coldest regions of the tri-star system, where temperatures are believed to be as low as 16 Kelvin or minus (-)257.15 degrees Celsius - well below the freezing point of carbon monoxide.\n\nCarbon Monoxide is key for scientists to trace the mass of gas during the formation of planets. The chemical composition of carbon monoxide - CO - carries carbon and oxygen, and reacts with other gases to form compounds like CH4 (methane). Its bright color helps astronomers model protoplanetary disks.\n\nINSIGHTS FROM THE DISCOVERY\n\nWhile scientists have been studying single star solar systems like our own, and have also carried out research on binary star systems like Alpha Centauri, understanding the complexities of a tri-star system is unique. The GG Tau A star system being located in our cosmic neighbourhood also helps answer key questions in astrophysics.\n\nIt helps understand the fundamental nature of planetary formation under the complications caused due to the gravitational force of three host stars.\n\nGravity, temperature, mass (energy), pressure, and frequency are key aspects of physics and studying these in a three-star system gives scientists a challenge as well as an opportunity to make groundbreaking discoveries in such complex conditions.\n\nTHE RADIO TELESCOPE IN ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE\n\nThe astronomers from India used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment or APEX radio telescope - one of the highest telescopes on Earth - located at a height of 5,064 meters above sea level in the Atacama desert in Chile.\n\nThe facility is built and operated by three European research institutes - The European Southern Observatory, The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, and The Onsala Space Observatory.\n\nThe APEX telescope is a modified ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) prototype antenna and is at the site of the ALMA observatory.\n\nThe ALMA telescope, also located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes which observe the electromagnetic radiation from space at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n"

Now, new observations from the James Webb Space Telescope appear to have confirmed those findings, suggesting that our model of the universe might be wrong.\n\nPhysicists, unusually, are desperate to find errors in their hypotheses: Relativity and quantum mechanics, the subject\u2019s main frameworks, are incredibly useful for predicting the world but are mutually incompatible, so finding an error in one or both could help unite the fields."

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:\n\nConnections between knowledge areas, introduced by Alena Tensor. Credit: Piotr Ogonowski (created with the support of AI tools)\n\nThe search for quantum gravity has gone on for 100 years, but it is not the only unification challenge in physics. Many of us believe that one day there will be a unification theory\u2014a theory that will reconcile many divergent physical theories.\n\nOur new article published in Physica Scripta brings new hope that such a theory exists. It demonstrates that the use of a certain mathematical object called Alena Tensor reconciles various physical theories, including general relativity, electrodynamics, quantum mechanics and continuum mechanics. Will this finally allow scientists to unify descriptions used in physics?\n\nWhat is Alena Tensor?\n\nAny movement under the influence of forces can be mathematically represented as movement along a curved path. Using differential geometry, one may equally well assume that the trajectory was straight, while the space in which the move took place is curved. It may sound complicated, but it can be assumed that there is a mathematical transformation that allows us to describe curved space-time equivalently as flat space-time where certain forces act.\n\nIt has long been suspected that such a transformation exists, although opinions on this matter are divided. Some physicists believe that the metric tensor, a mathematical object describing the curvature of space-time, is simply a feature of space-time. Some physicists, most often mathematical physicists, are of the opinion that such a transformation should exist.\n\nAlena Tensor provides just such a transformation. In short, Alena Tensor can straighten curved space-time while preserving all conclusions from general relativity. This property alone makes Alena Tensor an extremely valuable tool, but this is just the beginning.\n\nAlena Tensor in flat and curved space-time\n\nWe used Alena Tensor to describe a system with an electromagnetic field, obtaining three forces in flat space-time: electromagnetism (which is not surprising), \"against gravity,\" and radiation reaction force.\n\nThe radiation reaction force is already known in physics. It safeguards the principle of conservation of energy and ensures that the energy of an accelerating body does not exceed the energy available in the physical system.\n\nThe \"against gravity\" force generalizes classical Newton's equation for gravity, providing a relativistic description of gravity in flat space-time, fully consistent with general relativity:\n\nIt faithfully reproduces the motion described in curved space-time.\n\nThis force does not act in freefall, respecting the equivalence principle.\n\nGravity in this description is not a force but the counteraction to gravity is.\n\nThe Alena Tensor allows for a smooth transition to the description used in the electromagnetic theory and then it turns out that:\n\nCharged particles cannot remain at complete rest and should have spin, which agrees with quantum mechanics.\n\nThe reason for the existence of mass (and energy) of charged particles is the magnetic moment.\n\nThe above result basically explains what matter is, although so far it only applies to charged elementary particles and requires generalization to other fields.\n\nThe Alena Tensor also allows a smooth transition to the equations of general relativity. The obtained results provide some answers to the questions that have long puzzled physicists, concerning, e.g., singularities of black holes, cosmological constant, dark energy and dark matter.\n\nDiscover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights.

Alena Tensor completely reverses this approach. It is much easier now to describe gravity in flat space-time in a way that mathematically reproduces general relativity and then uses the known tools of quantum mechanics.\n\nTherefore, in the article we derived quantum equations describing the entire physical system with all previously mentioned forces. It turns out that these are three currently known main quantum equations. This leads to the completely surprising conclusion: It would mean that gravity has been present in quantum mechanics from the very beginning. It must be admitted that probably no one expected such a solution to the puzzle. In the article we also explain why it was so hard to spot gravity in quantum equations.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThere are interesting times ahead, but no one should expect an immediate revolution. Science does not develop at the pace of messages on social networks. It will take several months for this research paper to get noticed, several months before researchers take an interest in it, read it and use its results. It also takes many months to conduct and describe research using the new mathematical apparatus, then go through the peer review process and publish it.\n\nIn the first articles, we should expect attempts to falsify Alena Tensor, because in physics, like in all science, we need to be sure that our next steps lead in the right direction. If falsification deceives and further research and experiments confirm the results obtained from Alena Tensor, we may hope that in the next three to 10 years, this will lead to the unification and reconciliation of many descriptions currently used in physics.\n\nIt is also entirely possible that the article will go unnoticed or no one will pursue further research, as has happened many times before with innovations in science. Contrary to popular belief, for most readers, the innovation of the article is a disadvantage\u2014it is harder to read, understand and accept. The difficulties during the long publication process also indicate that many scientific journals see too much risk in publishing innovative research, especially if its authors are not widely known scientists.\n\nFortunately, this article was eventually published by a highly respected and inclusive journal that assesses the scientific value higher than non-meritorious criteria, for which I would like to publicly express my highest respect. The editor and reviewers provided constructive criticism, and their substantive comments helped to significantly improve the article, exactly the way science should function. However, it seems that research on non-mainstream methods of unifying physics (and Alena Tensor is one) may require much more time and perseverance.\n\nThe hope remains that future generations of physicists will complete the development of this method despite the obstacles, and in 20 to 40 years, Alena Tensor will inspire the scientific community to unify physics.\n\nThis story is part of Science X Dialog, where researchers can report findings from their published research articles.

It has also been banned.\n\nThe essay that Iyengar wrote is called 'On Pacifism'. As stated by The Commune Magazine, although not directly calling for violent resistance, the essay speaks that pacifist tactics might not be the best recourse for Palestine.\n\nThe essay features a logo of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a terrorist organisation according to the US State Department. However, Iyengar said that the charges of terrorism on him are only because of the photos in the essay which were not provided by him.\n\n\"The administration accuses me of supporting 'terrorism', because the edition in which my article appears includes images of posters from the Popular Front for the Liberation and of containing violent imagery in the publication,\" his statement said, which was shared by his lawyer Eric Lee on X.\n\nAccording to the college, the essay had language that \"could be interpreted as a call for more violent or destructive forms of protests at MIT\". The MIT Dean of Student Life, David Warren Randall emailed this to the magazine's editors.\n\nIyengar has raised an issue of the lack of freedom of speech in American campuses. But this is not the first time he has been suspended.\n\nHe was suspended last year after the pro-Palestine demonstrations.\n\nAn \"extraordinary action\" is what he believes his suspension is.\n\n\"These extraordinary actions should concern everyone on camp,\" he says in the statement. \"Expelling me and banning Written Revolution from campus as a result of this article would mark an unprecedented attack on the rights of the entire student body and faculty. Consider the precedent MIT has set.\"\n\nThe MIT Coalition Against Apartheid has started a protest against MIT's decision. \"Prahlad is now appealing his case with the Chancellor to reduce the unjust sanctions against him. We have launched a campaign to put pressure on MIT's administration to stop criminalising students who stand on the right side of history. We call on all organisations and institutions of conscience to sign up and stand up to MIT's repression,\" said the coalition in a statement.\n\n\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 MIT is effectively expelling PhD student Prahlad Iyengar for Palestine activism on campus. \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\n\n\n\nEMERGENCY RALLY: Cambridge City Hall, Monday, 12/9 at 5:30pm.
