        "article_content": "As founders plan for an increasingly AI-centric future, Gusto co-founder and head of technology Edward Kim said that cutting existing teams and hiring a bunch of specially trained AI engineers is \u201cthe wrong way to go.\u201d\n\nInstead, he argued that non-technical team members can \u201cactually have a much deeper understanding than an average engineer on what situations the customer can get themselves into, what they\u2019re confused about,\u201d putting them in a better position to guide the features that should be built into AI tools.\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Kim \u2014 whose payroll startup generated more than $500 million in annual revenue in the fiscal year that ended in April 2023 \u2014 outlined Gusto\u2019s approach to AI, with non-technical members of its customer experience team writing \u201crecipes\u201d that guide the way its AI assistant Gus (announced last month) interacts with customers.\n\nKim also said that the company is seeing that \u201cpeople who are not software engineers, but a little technically minded, are able to build really powerful and game-changing AI applications,\u201d such as CoPilot \u2014 a customer experience tool that was rolled out to the Gusto CX team in June and is already seeing between 2,000 and 3,000 interactions per day.\n\n\u201cWe can actually upskill a lot of our people here at Gusto to help them build AI applications,\u201d Kim said.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIs Gus the first big AI product that you\u2019ve released to your customers?\n\nGus is the big AI functionality that we launched to our customers, and in many ways ties together a lot of the point functionality that we\u2019ve built. Because what you start to see happen in apps is they get littered with AI buttons that are, like, \u201cPress this button to do something with AI.\u201d Ours was, \u201cPress this button so we can generate a job description for you.\u201d\n\nBut Gus allows you to remove all of that, and when we feel Gus can do something that is of value to you, Gus can in an unobtrusive way pop up and say, \u201cHey, I can help you write a job description?\u201d It\u2019s a much cleaner way to interface with AI.\n\nThere are some companies that say they\u2019ve been doing AI for a million years but didn\u2019t get attention until now, and others that say they only realized the opportunity in the last couple years. Does Gusto fall in one camp or the other?\n\nThe big change for me is, when you talk about software programming, for most people, it\u2019s not accessible. You have to learn how to code, go to school for many years. Machine learning was even more inaccessible. Because you have to be a very special type of software engineer and have this data science skill set and know how to create artificial neural networks and things like that.\n\nThe main thing that changed recently is that the interface to create ML and AI applications [has become] much more accessible to anybody. Whereas in the past, we\u2019ve had to learn the language of computers and go to school for that, now computers are learning to understand humans more. And that seems like not that big of a deal, but if you think about it, it just makes building software applications so much more accessible.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen at Gusto: People who are not software engineers, but a little technically minded, are able to build really powerful and game-changing AI applications. We\u2019re actually using a lot of our support team to extend the capabilities of Gus, and they don\u2019t know how to program at all. It\u2019s just that the interface that they use now allows them to do the same thing that software engineers have always done, without needing to learn how to code. If you want, I could talk through one example of each of those.\n\nThat\u2019d be great.\n\nThere\u2019s this one individual who\u2019s been at the company for about five years. His name is Eric Rodriguez, and he actually joined the customer support team [and then] transferred into our IT team. While he was on that team, he started to get pretty interested in AI, and his boss came up to me and was like, \u201cHey, he built this thing. I want you to see it.\u201d My first time meeting him in-person, he showed me what he had built, which was essentially a CoPilot tool for our [customer experience] team, where you could ask it a question, and it will just give you the answer in natural language. Just like ChatGPT might, except it has access to our internal knowledge base of how to do things in our app.\n\nAt this point, we show this to our support team, and they loved it. It completely changed their workflows and how efficient they are. Basically, anytime they get a support ticket, instead of going through this knowledge base that we\u2019ve built, they actually ask this CoPilot tool, and the CoPilot tool actually answers the question for them. There\u2019s still a human in between the CoPilot and the customer, but a lot of times they\u2019re able to just get the response from the CoPilot tool and then copy paste it to the customer. They verify that it\u2019s accurate, which most of the time it is.\n\nWe immediately transferred [Eric] to the software engineering team. He actually reports directly to me, believe it or not, and he\u2019s one of our best engineers now. Because he was one of the early adopters of just playing around with AI and now he\u2019s on the forefront of building AI applications at Gusto.\n\nNot everyone is technically minded like Eric, but we have found a way at Gusto to leverage the domain knowledge expertise of non-technical folks in the company, especially in our customer support team, to help us build more powerful AI applications, and in particular, enable Gus to do more and more things.\n\nAnytime the customer support team gets a support ticket \u2014 in other words, one of our customers reaches out to us because they want our support team\u2019s help on something \u2014 and if it comes up repeatedly, we actually have the customer support team write a recipe for Gus, meaning that they can actually teach Gus without any technical ability. They can teach Gus to walk that customer through that problem, and sometimes even take action.\n\nWe\u2019ve built an internal interface, an internal facing tool, where you can write instructions in natural language to Gus on how to handle a case like that. And there\u2019s actually a no-code way for our support team to be able to tell Gus to call a certain API to accomplish a task.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of conversation out there right now that\u2019s like, \u201cWe are going to eliminate all these jobs in this one area and we\u2019re hiring these AI specialists that we\u2019re paying millions of dollars because they have this unique skill set.\u201d And I just think that\u2019s the wrong way to go about doing it. Because the people who are going to be able to progress your AI applications are actually the ones that have the domain expertise of that area, even though they may not have the technical expertise. We can actually upskill a lot of our people here at Gusto to help them build AI applications.\n\nThe scary AI scenario is this top-down thing where executives are saying, \u201cWe need to use AI\u201d and it\u2019s disconnected from the reality of how people work. It sounds like this is more bottoms up, where you\u2019ve built tools to allow teams to tell you what AI can do for them.\n\nExactly. In fact, the non-technical folks that are closer to the customers, they talk to them every single day, they actually have a much deeper understanding than an average engineer on what situations the customer can get themselves into, what they\u2019re confused about. So they are actually in a better position than engineers or AI scientists to write the instructions to Gus to solve that problem.\n\nI think other people I\u2019ve talked to have noticed the same thing. The best AI engineers are actually the people that are the domain experts that have learned how to write good prompts.\n\nAs you think about how this plays out over the next few years, do you think the company\u2019s headcount across different teams is going to look pretty similar, or do you think that\u2019ll change over time as AI is deployed across the company?\n\nI think the role does evolve a little bit. I think you\u2019ll see a lot of our CX folks not directly answering questions, but actually writing recipes and doing things like prompt tuning to improve the AI. Everyone\u2019s going to just move up the abstraction layer, and then obviously it will bring more efficiencies to the company and also better customer experience, because they\u2019ll get their questions answered immediately.\n\nAnd that unlocks Gusto to do more things for our customers. There\u2019s a huge roadmap of things that we want to be doing, but we can\u2019t, because we\u2019re constrained in resources."

WhatsApp is no exception, with the app gaining the services of the Meta AI chatbot not too long ago. We've seen WhatsApp make multiple changes to its Meta AI implementation over the past few updates, with the app recently adding granular editing controls for AI-generated images. WhatsApp is now working on another update for its AI chatbot, one that could make it easier to manage what it remembers about your chats.\n\nThe WhatsApp sleuths over at WABetaInfo dug into version 2.24.22.9 of WhatsApp beta for Android to find a new Memory section within the app. More specifically, this Memory option has sprung up within the Chat info page, accessed by tapping the top of a chat.\n\nOn older betas of WhatsApp for Android, the Chat info page contains minimal options, including buttons for Message, Share, and Search, followed by a brief disclaimer about how AI can get things wrong at times.\n\nThere are also options for managing notifications and deciding whether media generated by Meta AI is saved to the device's gallery. But with v2.24.22.9 of WhatsApp beta for Android, a brand-new Memory option appears right below Media visibility, along with the description \"What Meta AI remembers about you.\"\n\nA much-needed privacy addition\n\nWhatsApp Meta AI Memory Tab\n\nThe text inside the Memory page mentions that \"Meta AI automatically remembers certain parts of your chat to give you more relevant responses.\" Users can ensure the chatbot remembers something by asking it to \"remember this\" after a prompt. Having Meta AI remember specific parts of your conversation should help generate better-quality responses over a period of time, especially if it's a subject you bring up frequently with the chatbot.\n\nWhile it's unclear what this Memory page will look like when populated, we suspect there will be an easy option to remove any memory the chatbot has stored. WABetaInfo says this feature is still in development, which explains why I couldn't get it to appear despite sideloading the APK from APKMirror. Nevertheless, given how important a feature like this is, particularly from a privacy perspective, we expect it to eventually make it to the stable version of the chat app.\n\nWhatsApp Messenger\n\nWhatsApp LLC\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nPrice: Free\n\n4.3\n\nDownload"

        "article_content": "NEW DELHI : Since the 1990s, Photoshop, an image-editing software, has become a colloquial verb for photo retouching. However, over the past two years, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has changed the way photo editing has worked so far, automating most of the steps into one-click commands. This, though, hasn\u2019t affected Photoshop's ubiquity\u2014in fact, it may well be better suited for even more users now.\n\nWhy is Photoshop so significant?\n\nThe Adobe-owned photo-editing software, which started as a college project in the late 1980s, is a verb now like Xerox, Band-aid and Velcro. While there\u2019s no official figure, the industry estimates it to have over 25 million monthly active subscribers. Those using it without a licence could be exponentially higher. On average, well over 90% of all designers and creative professionals use Photoshop in some form, making it a bellwether in the global photo-editing and -designing industry. With the global market for photo-editing tools estimated at over $3 billion annually, Photoshop alone makes a sizable dent in the creative economy.\n\nCan generative AI completely replace it?\n\nThat was an early-stage fear. However, Adobe has implemented generative AI to work alongside designers and not replace them. The company\u2019s proprietary AI model, Firefly, is now integrated into the application and is used to detect objects to remove, help co-design, edit images and posters, and more. Photoshop\u2019s idea of using generative AI is akin to what GitHub did with the technology: Use it to aid but not replace creators. This, experts believe, can speed up creativity processes, and more new users may end up using Photoshop instead of new editing applications replacing the tool.\n\nAre other image editors also on a similar trajectory?\n\nYes. Autodesk\u2019s Pixlr and Australia-based independent creativity suite Canva are two of the most popular image-editing applications after Photoshop. They, too, have started implementing open-source AI models into their software to attract more users beyond designers.\n\nAlso Read: What makes AI the next big revolution in personal computing\n\nWill other creativity apps face a similar impact?\n\nThe idea is to use generative AI to make creative designing accessible to novices and non-designers. Photoshop\u2019s trajectory now offers novices a reason to subscribe to it, with the AI interface making the app\u2019s technical features seem simple to most. Other creativity apps, such as Microsoft PowerPoint, are also incorporating generative AI to add illustrations and simplify designing. In the long run, Big Tech hopes that the simplicity of AI will draw more users to these apps, which, in turn, will increase subscription revenue beyond just those who specialize in creative fields.\n\nFor more such explainers, read Primer.\n\nDoes this mean designers are nearly out of business?\n\nThis is a mixed bag. India has a large, unorganized economy of image-related businesses in physical stores along office districts. These businesses specialize in making basic posters and illustrations. With generative AI integrated into Photoshop and similar applications, in-house marketing teams and even individuals can make basic creative designs. In a way, while this may reduce the revenue of unofficial businesses, that\u2019s good news for the likes of Adobe and Autodesk. However, professional designers would find great value in AI-assisted Photoshop\u2014this can reduce turnaround times and enable better original designs and animations in the long run."

        "article_content": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nCredit: Blumhouse Productions\n\nBlumhouse Productions is known for making terrifying movies on a tight budget. Now the horror movie studio behind the likes of Paranormal Activity, Five Nights at Freddy's and BlacKkKlansman is working with Meta to test Meta Movie Gen, the AI video generator that the owner of Facebook and Instagram revealed earlier this month. And that could be a scary combination.\n\nSelect creatives are taking part in the pilot, including Casey Affleck from I\u2019m Still Here and Light of My Life, Aneesh Chaganty, and the Spurlock Sisters, who are part of Blumhouse\u2019s first annual Screamwriting Fellowship. Aneesh has already produced a video using Meta's AI tool in which he says he was all against AI until he realised that his ten-year-old self would have loved it for his homemade movies.\n\nFor the video above, Aneesh used Meta Movie Gen to change the backdrops or add special effects to short movies he made as a kid \u201cI hate AI. But with a tool like this? I dunno\u2026 maybe I\u2019d have just dreamed a little bigger,\" he says, noting that what he likes about the tool is that \"little Aneesh would still have had to make the movie.\"\n\nIt's an emotive and clever plug for the tech that highlights its potential for human-led storytelling while also excusing the current limited quality of the AI output. I mean, sure, it is good enough for a kid's home movie. I would have been thrilled to have had access to this tech when I was a kid trying to produce Doctor Who episodes in the lunch break at primary school.\n\nBlumhouse founder and CEO Jason Blum continues the tone in his statement in Meta's announcement. \u201cArtists are, and forever will be, the lifeblood of our industry,\u201d he says. \"Innovation and tools that can help those artists better tell their stories is something we are always keen to explore, and we welcomed the chance for some of them to test this cutting-edge technology and give their notes on its pros and cons while it\u2019s still in development.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThese are going to be powerful tools for directors, and it\u2019s important to engage the creative industry in their development to make sure they\u2019re best suited for the job.\u201d\n\nAs for Meta, it says Movie Gen will allow creatives to more quickly express ideas and \"explore visual direction, tone and mood.\u201d \u201cWe heard that filmmakers see potential for Movie Gen as a collaborator and thought partner, with its unexpected response to text prompts inspiring new ideas,\u201d it said.\n\nIt also seems that public access to Movie Gen might arrive sooner than we thought. Meta initially said it had no plans to open access \"anytime soon\". But CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted on Instagram to say Movie Gen would be coming to the platform next year (he made the announcement via a video of himself doing leg presses in different historical eras \u2013 you can see that gem below).\n\nA post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) A photo posted by on\n\nConnor Hayes, VP of gen AI, has confirmed that timeframe. \u201cWhile we\u2019re not planning to incorporate Movie Gen models into any public products until next year, Meta feels it\u2019s important to have an open and early dialogue with the creative community about how it can be the most useful tool for creativity and ensure its responsible use,\u201d he said.\n\nMeta's collaboration with Blumhouse is another example of how studios are starting to take AI video generation seriously. It comes shortly after Runway entered into a deal to create a bespoke AI model for the film and TV producer Lionsgate.\n\nMeta says Movie Gen can currently create videos of up to 16 seconds in different aspect ratios and audio of up to 45 seconds and that it compares well against Runway, OpenAI's Sora and Kling. If it gets a release, Meta's AI video generator is also likely to compete against Adobe Firefly Video, which is already powering the new Generative Extend in Premiere Pro.\n\nIt's not clear how the model was trained, however. Meta has said that Movie Gen was trained on a \u201ca combination of licensed and publicly available datasets\u201d but hasn't specified which. Meta has access to vast amounts of video data through its products like Instagram and Facebook."

It's also said to be haunted by the ghost of Gulielma \"Elma\" Sands, the woman whose body was found in the well more than two centuries ago.\n\nHistorical novelist Lauren Willig, who researched the trial for her upcoming book, \u201cThe Girl From Greenwich Street,\u201d said the ghost stories began immediately after Sands\u2019 death.\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re going and collecting testimony about Elma\u2019s murder, there are all of these stories about people hearing a voice in the night from the meadow crying, \u2018murder, murder, help me,\u2019\u201d she said, noting that at the time, the well was located outdoors in an area known as Lispenard\u2019s Meadow.\n\nSands, 22, disappeared after leaving her boarding house on the evening of Dec. 22, 1799. She\u2019d told her cousin she was on her way to marry Levi Weeks, a man who had been courting her. Her bruised body was found in the well about a week-and-a-half later. Sands\u2019 family immediately suspected that Weeks was behind her murder, and a grand jury later indicted him.\n\nWeeks\u2019 brother Ezra was well connected in New York, and retained the services of an all-star legal team consisting of Henry Brockholst Livingston, Aaron Burr, and none other than Alexander Hamilton.\n\nAccording to the Historical Society of the New York Courts, the state\u2019s case was \u201centirely circumstantial,\u201d while the defense team produced witnesses who testified that Weeks was with his brother and other friends the night Sands went missing. The jury acquitted Weeks of the murder after just five minutes of deliberation, and Sands\u2019 murder remains unsolved.\n\n\u201cI think the ghost story, in some ways, catches on that sense of injustice and uncertainty, because where there can't be earthly justice, there's still the ghost trying out for some sort of restitution, or just for attention,\u201d Willig said.\n\nA four-story building was built just south of the well in 1817. It eventually came to house the Manhattan Bistro starting in the 1950s, when the well was no longer visible at street level. It was rediscovered when the owner excavated the basement in the 1980s, according to a 2011 Wall Street Journal report. Although the owner said at the time that she wasn\u2019t sure about paranormal activity, she added that bottles had inexplicably shot off the shelves behind the Bistro\u2019s bar on two occasions.\n\nCOS moved in after the building was sold in 2015."

        "article_content": "A new discovery about how the liver flushes cholesterol from the body could lead to more effective treatments for cardiovascular disease \u2013 the leading cause of death worldwide.\n\nUniversity of Leeds researchers have found that the production of bile, which is vital for flushing excess cholesterol from the body, is affected by the rate blood flows into the liver via the 'portal' vein from the intestine.\n\nPrevious research has shown that blood flow in the portal vein increases and decreases throughout the day in response to movement, rest, and intake of foods.\n\nThe Leeds team has now identified that bile production increases when blood flow in the portal vein decreases, which happens as a result of exercise or fasting. Conversely, bile production is lower when blood flow in the portal vein increases, which happens when people eat and rest.\n\nLow bile production can result in high levels of cholesterol remaining in the blood, which can contribute to the development of fatty liver disease. If untreated, this can progress to liver inflammation and fibrosis, currently affecting one in three people in the UK.\n\nThis breakthrough provides an opportunity for the development of new treatments to tackle cardiovascular disease and prevent the progression of fatty liver disease.\n\nThis discovery, that the liver does not have a constant and stable function but is able to sense the changes and adjust its functionality depending on the body's needs, is incredible. Our findings can be used by surgeons and experts in diseases of the liver and digestive system such as gallstones and liver cirrhosis, in their treatment of patients, to understand better the origins of these diseases.\" Dr. Laeticia Lichtenstein, Lead Researcher, Lecturer in Nutrient and Metabolism in the School of Food Science and Nutrition\n\nThe team's research, published in Science Advances, has revealed for the first time that portal vein blood flow is linked to cholesterol levels in the blood.\n\nIt shows that a pressure-sensing protein called PIEZO1 detects blood flow rate through the vein, sparking a chemical chain reaction which turns cholesterol in the blood into bile acids to be eliminated from the body.\n\nLiver and heart function\n\nOne of the key functions of the liver is to regulate the amount of fat in the blood, so when levels are elevated, fatty liver disease can develop. This can damage the liver and lead to more serious conditions including cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer.\n\nCholesterol is a type of fat that is essential for the body's normal functioning and is found in all the cells of the body. There are two types - 'good' which is helpful for the body's functioning, and 'bad' which can build up in arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nHigh cholesterol levels may have a genetic basis or be linked to some medications and health conditions but are also associated with lifestyle factors including diets high in saturated and trans fats; a lack of physical activity; obesity; smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.\n\nFirst-line treatments include following a healthier lifestyle, but patients can also be prescribed medications such as statins to reduce so called 'bad' cholesterol. However, some patients may have reduced mobility or suffer from side effects from statins. Furthermore, a better understanding of other factors, like blood flow and its impact on the regulation of fats, is needed to improve how medications work.\n\nSenior investigator Professor David Beech from the University of Leeds' School of Medicine, said: \"Laeticia's exciting work opens a potentially important new avenue for clinical interventions in the increasing global problem of liver dysfunction.\""

You must take two materials that have the properties that you want and, like making a baby, you must see how to combine them to get exactly the offspring that you want.\n\nMeta (formerly, Facebook), often bashed for cashing-in on data, has now given a meta gift to mankind: tomes of data \u2014 for research into functional (meta) materials.\n\nThe global giant has just released copious amounts of data about behaviour of materials at the atomic level, under its Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) initiative, for free.\n\nThis data can help scientists combine different materials with different desired properties to create something new. Examples of functional materials that can tackle climate change include new catalysts for renewable energy storage, carbon neutral fuels, new sorbents for direct air capture, etc.\n\nCreating such materials is somewhat similar to discovering a drug molecule for disease by trying out different combinations of molecules or making a dish of desired taste, texture and flavour from millions of ingredients.\n\nTraditionally, making meta materials involved playing trial-and-error with millions of data points from thousands of materials. But now, there is Artificial Intelligence (AI), which can deliver the goods, however, AI is data hungry.\n\nMeta has provided this food for AI. The OMat24 dataset is a collection of data generated from simulations and calculations on different inorganic materials. This dataset contains information on 118 million atomic structures, whichhas information on three parameters \u2014 total energy (the overall energy of the material\u2019s structure), forces (acting on each atom) and cell stress (indicating how the material could deform under certain conditions.) All this was calculated using \u2018density functional theory\u2019, a quantum mechanics-based method for predicting material properties .\n\n\u201cThe search space of possible materials is enormous and remains a significant challenge for both computational and experimental approaches to material science,\u201d says a yet-to-be peer-reviewed paper by scientists at Meta\u2019s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) group. \u201cIdentifying promising candidates through computational screening with machine learning models offers the potential to dramatically increase the search space and the rate of experimental discovery,\u201d says the paper, written by Luis Borroso-Luque et al.\n\nFAIR scientists took over 400 million core-hours of computing to get the data of 118 million structures labelled with total energy, forces and cell stress. (One CPU core used for one hour is one core-hour.) These parameters give an idea of the stability of materials under given conditions.\n\nNow that there is data on over 118 million atomic structures, one can train an AI model to come up with the best combination of any of them for a desired material."

Lalit has also taught a course as a visiting faculty on Nutrition & Health at IIT Kanpur for one semester. LESS ... MORE\n\nDuring the early 20th century, several significant developments led to the emergence of what we now call modern medicine:\n\n1. The overhaul of medical education, initiated by the Flexner Report in 1910, commissioned at the request of John Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, the two richest men in the world.\n\n2. The discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, a bacteriologist at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in London.\n\n3. The discovery of vitamin C by Hungarian biochemist Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi in 1928, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1937.\n\nIt had long been known that sailors on extendegd voyages suffered from a disease called scurvy. The French and British navies had established recommendations for sailors to consume citrus fruits daily. However, after the discovery of vitamin C, it was believed that the ill health of sailors was due to a deficiency in vitamin C. This understanding contributed to the evolution of the science of nutrition as we know it today. Modern nutrition is largely reductionist, focusing on breaking down food into its nutrient components. Patients are diagnosed based on the composition of nutrients in their blood, with deficiencies supplemented and surpluses managed through dietary restrictions.\n\nHad early observers of scurvy in sailors concluded that the problem was due to a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables, rather than solely a vitamin C deficiency\u2014which we now know to be a more accurate understanding\u2014the trajectory of nutrition science might have been different. However, this approach would have posed a challenge: it wouldn\u2019t have generated profit. Neither doctors, supplement manufacturers, nor pharmaceutical companies would have benefited. Dr. Colin Campbell, regarded as one of the foremost nutritionists today, has consistently emphasized the need to rewrite nutrition science and unlearn much of what has been taught over the past century.\n\nThe discovery of epigenetics in recent decades has shown us that it is not just the individual components of nutrition that matter, but the whole food, along with its inherent bacteria. As Dr. Campbell puts it, rather than focusing on individual instruments, we should focus on the symphony.\n\nNutrition science has unfortunately centered around creating a \u201cnormal\u201d range for various nutrients, against which any sample is analyzed. Let\u2019s explore how these so called normal ranges are derived.\n\nWhat is normal?\n\nWhen you get lab tests done\u2014whether blood, urine, or stool\u2014the report compares your results to a range called \u201cnormal.\u201d But have you ever wondered who decided what \u201cnormal\u201d is?\n\nThis range is derived from a large sample of the population. For any test, readings vary from person to person, forming a bell curve. The area under two standard deviations (2\u03c3) covers about 95% of the total sample. This is what \u201cnormal\u201d means. For example, if your hemoglobin is between 14-17 g/dL, you fall within the 95% of the population. If your reading is above 17 or below 14, it simply means you\u2019re in the top or bottom 2.5%. This is often misunderstood as a sign of a problem, which may or may not be the case.\n\nIt\u2019s essential for both you and your doctor to understand why your reading is outside the \u201cnormal\u201d range. For some blood chemistry markers, the cutoff is determined by committees made up of healthcare providers, pharmaceutical industry representatives, and government agencies like the FDA. For example, the criteria for total cholesterol, vitamin D, fasting glucose, and blood pressure are established by different bodies.\n\nThere are various vested interests in keeping these cutoff points low (or high), as it can increase the number of patients, benefiting doctors and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nSince modern medicine has largely developed in Western countries like England and America, large samples were taken from their local populations to establish these \u201cnormal\u201d criteria. These reflect the diet, lifestyle, and health of those populations. However, in countries like India, medical guidelines are often adopted from the West without considering genetic differences and dietary habits.\n\nFor example, Americans predominantly consume meat, while many Indians are vegetarians, leading to discrepancies. Hemoglobin is one area where Indian people often fall short of the established \u201cnormal\u201d range. But this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are unhealthy or in need of medication or supplements.\n\nAnother example is potassium. The normal range is 3.6 to 5.2mmol/L. Americans typically don\u2019t consume much green leafy vegetables, which are rich in potassium. Once you start a diet rich in plant-based whole foods, intermittent fasting, or similar health-conscious programs, your potassium intake rises, and blood tests may show levels above the upper range. This doesn\u2019t mean you have a health problem\u2014it means you\u2019re healthier than 95% of Americans!\n\nVicious cycle of overdiagnosis\n\nWhat increasingly happens is that a seemingly healthy person with poor eating habits undergoes a checkup at age 45 or 50. The doctor orders various tests, points out discrepancies, and prescribes medication or supplements. You take the medication, start to worry, and a \u201cnocebo effect\u201d takes hold\u2014you imagine symptoms. Medication also comes with side effects or adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Within six months, you feel unwell and visit the doctor again, who prescribes more medication. This vicious cycle continues, and before long, you\u2019re 60 years old and taking five medications. This is what happened to me.\n\nDoctors today are not trained in nutrition, so they don\u2019t provide dietary guidance. If pressed by patients, they share whatever they\u2019ve gleaned from mass media, which is heavily influenced by the food and drug industry.\n\nDon\u2019t kill the messenger\n\nLifestyle diseases exist on a continuum. They start as soon as a child is weaned off breast milk and begins eating whatever their parents feed him. If the diet is unhealthy, the body compensates by increasing blood pressure, insulin secretion, or other mechanisms. These compensatory systems keep major markers like blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol in check. However, once the body can no longer compensate, these markers slowly rise. When they reach a certain point, as determined by governing bodies like the ADA, AHA, or ACP, the person is labeled as having a chronic disease.\n\nThe right approach would be to correct the diet and lifestyle that led to the rise in markers. However, in practice, doctors focus on lowering the markers through medication. When the markers return to the \u201cnormal\u201d range, the person feels \u201chealed,\u201d but no attention is paid to the underlying cause. Over time, the markers rise again, and the doctor either increases the medication dose or adds a new drug. The side effects of these medications often lead to other health issues.\n\nI call this the suppression of symptoms, akin to killing the messenger. Rather than addressing the root cause\u2014an unhealthy diet and lifestyle\u2014we attack the symptoms. Most medications for lifestyle diseases work this way: they don\u2019t address the disease\u2019s cause, just the symptoms. Unfortunately, nutrition science is not part of medical school curricula, and doctors are trained to focus on managing symptoms and bring them in normal range rather than understanding the bigger picture of health.\n\nPlease listen to Padma Vibhushan Dr. B.M.Hegde and Dr. Colin Campbell speak on the subject.\n\nWhat is Normal BP\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NQoD-LiwSFw? si=swZtRjvq4LIgzI1V\n\nT.

        "article_content": "Summarize Simplifying... In short A recent study has discovered that the liver's bile production, which helps flush out cholesterol, is influenced by the rate of blood flow from the intestine.\n\nThis blood flow, which varies throughout the day due to activities like exercise and eating, triggers a protein that converts cholesterol into bile acids.\n\nHowever, low bile production can lead to high cholesterol levels, potentially causing liver diseases.\n\nThis groundbreaking research could aid in treating liver and digestive system diseases. Was a long read? Making it simpler... Next Article Next Article\n\nThe discovery could help in treating cardiovascular diseases\n\nNew study reveals how liver flushes out cholesterol\n\nBy Akash Pandey 01:21 pm Oct 20, 202401:21 pm\n\nWhat's the story In a groundbreaking study, researchers at the University of Leeds have revealed a new way in which the liver rids the body of cholesterol. The discovery could pave the way for more effective treatments for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide. The study looked at bile production, an essential process for removing excess cholesterol from the body, and its link with blood flow into the liver.\n\nKey findings\n\nBile production and blood flow: A crucial connection\n\nThe study found bile production is affected by how quickly blood enters the liver via the \"portal\" vein from the intestine. It was found that this blood flow varies throughout the day as a result of movement, rest, and eating. The researchers found an inverse relationship between bile production and portal vein blood flow, with bile production increasing during periods of decreased blood flow due to exercise or fasting.\n\nHealth risks\n\nImplications of low bile production on health\n\nThe research also emphasized that low bile production can result in high cholesterol levels in the blood, which may contribute to fatty liver disease. If untreated, this can progress into liver inflammation and fibrosis. Dr. Laeticia Lichtenstein, the lead researcher of the study, stressed the importance of their findings saying, \"This discovery...is incredible.\" She added that these findings could help doctors treating liver and digestive system diseases.\n\nNovel discovery\n\nLink between portal vein blood flow and cholesterol\n\nPublished in Science Advances, the study is the first to link portal vein blood flow to blood cholesterol levels. It found that a pressure-sensing protein called PIEZO1 senses the change in blood flow rate through the vein. This initiates a chemical reaction that converts cholesterol into bile acids for removal from the body. The study highlights the liver's importance in controlling fat levels in blood and avoiding fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, liver failure, and cancer.\n\nCholesterol types\n\nCholesterol: A double-edged sword\n\nCholesterol, a fat necessary for normal body functioning, can be both good and bad. There are two types of cholesterol - \"good\" cholesterol that helps body functions and \"bad\" cholesterol that can build up in arteries, increasing heart disease and stroke risks. High cholesterol levels may be due to genetics, certain medications or health conditions but are also associated with lifestyle factors like unhealthy diets, lack of physical activity, obesity, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption."

        "article_content": "As founders plan for an increasingly AI-centric future, Gusto co-founder and head of technology Edward Kim said that cutting existing teams and hiring a bunch of specially trained AI engineers is \u201cthe wrong way to go.\u201d\n\nInstead, he argued that non-technical team members can \u201cactually have a much deeper understanding than an average engineer on what situations the customer can get themselves into, what they\u2019re confused about,\u201d putting them in a better position to guide the features that should be built into AI tools.\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Kim \u2014 whose payroll startup generated more than $500 million in annual revenue in the fiscal year that ended in April 2023 \u2014 outlined Gusto\u2019s approach to AI, with non-technical members of its customer experience team writing \u201crecipes\u201d that guide the way its AI assistant Gus (announced last month) interacts with customers.\n\nKim also said that the company is seeing that \u201cpeople who are not software engineers, but a little technically minded, are able to build really powerful and game-changing AI applications,\u201d such as CoPilot \u2014 a customer experience tool that was rolled out to the Gusto CX team in June and is already seeing between 2,000 and 3,000 interactions per day.\n\n\u201cWe can actually upskill a lot of our people here at Gusto to help them build AI applications,\u201d Kim said.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIs Gus the first big AI product that you\u2019ve released to your customers?\n\nGus is the big AI functionality that we launched to our customers, and in many ways ties together a lot of the point functionality that we\u2019ve built. Because what you start to see happen in apps is they get littered with AI buttons that are, like, \u201cPress this button to do something with AI.\u201d Ours was, \u201cPress this button so we can generate a job description for you.\u201d\n\nBut Gus allows you to remove all of that, and when we feel Gus can do something that is of value to you, Gus can in an unobtrusive way pop up and say, \u201cHey, I can help you write a job description?\u201d It\u2019s a much cleaner way to interface with AI.\n\nThere are some companies that say they\u2019ve been doing AI for a million years but didn\u2019t get attention until now, and others that say they only realized the opportunity in the last couple years. Does Gusto fall in one camp or the other?\n\nThe big change for me is, when you talk about software programming, for most people, it\u2019s not accessible. You have to learn how to code, go to school for many years. Machine learning was even more inaccessible. Because you have to be a very special type of software engineer and have this data science skill set and know how to create artificial neural networks and things like that.\n\nThe main thing that changed recently is that the interface to create ML and AI applications [has become] much more accessible to anybody. Whereas in the past, we\u2019ve had to learn the language of computers and go to school for that, now computers are learning to understand humans more. And that seems like not that big of a deal, but if you think about it, it just makes building software applications so much more accessible.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen at Gusto: People who are not software engineers, but a little technically minded, are able to build really powerful and game-changing AI applications. We\u2019re actually using a lot of our support team to extend the capabilities of Gus, and they don\u2019t know how to program at all. It\u2019s just that the interface that they use now allows them to do the same thing that software engineers have always done, without needing to learn how to code. If you want, I could talk through one example of each of those.\n\nThat\u2019d be great.\n\nThere\u2019s this one individual who\u2019s been at the company for about five years. His name is Eric Rodriguez, and he actually joined the customer support team [and then] transferred into our IT team. While he was on that team, he started to get pretty interested in AI, and his boss came up to me and was like, \u201cHey, he built this thing. I want you to see it.\u201d My first time meeting him in-person, he showed me what he had built, which was essentially a CoPilot tool for our [customer experience] team, where you could ask it a question, and it will just give you the answer in natural language. Just like ChatGPT might, except it has access to our internal knowledge base of how to do things in our app.\n\nAt this point, we show this to our support team, and they loved it. It completely changed their workflows and how efficient they are. Basically, anytime they get a support ticket, instead of going through this knowledge base that we\u2019ve built, they actually ask this CoPilot tool, and the CoPilot tool actually answers the question for them. There\u2019s still a human in between the CoPilot and the customer, but a lot of times they\u2019re able to just get the response from the CoPilot tool and then copy paste it to the customer. They verify that it\u2019s accurate, which most of the time it is.\n\nWe immediately transferred [Eric] to the software engineering team. He actually reports directly to me, believe it or not, and he\u2019s one of our best engineers now. Because he was one of the early adopters of just playing around with AI and now he\u2019s on the forefront of building AI applications at Gusto.\n\nNot everyone is technically minded like Eric, but we have found a way at Gusto to leverage the domain knowledge expertise of non-technical folks in the company, especially in our customer support team, to help us build more powerful AI applications, and in particular, enable Gus to do more and more things.\n\nAnytime the customer support team gets a support ticket \u2014 in other words, one of our customers reaches out to us because they want our support team\u2019s help on something \u2014 and if it comes up repeatedly, we actually have the customer support team write a recipe for Gus, meaning that they can actually teach Gus without any technical ability. They can teach Gus to walk that customer through that problem, and sometimes even take action.\n\nWe\u2019ve built an internal interface, an internal facing tool, where you can write instructions in natural language to Gus on how to handle a case like that. And there\u2019s actually a no-code way for our support team to be able to tell Gus to call a certain API to accomplish a task.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of conversation out there right now that\u2019s like, \u201cWe are going to eliminate all these jobs in this one area and we\u2019re hiring these AI specialists that we\u2019re paying millions of dollars because they have this unique skill set.\u201d And I just think that\u2019s the wrong way to go about doing it. Because the people who are going to be able to progress your AI applications are actually the ones that have the domain expertise of that area, even though they may not have the technical expertise. We can actually upskill a lot of our people here at Gusto to help them build AI applications.\n\nThe scary AI scenario is this top-down thing where executives are saying, \u201cWe need to use AI\u201d and it\u2019s disconnected from the reality of how people work. It sounds like this is more bottoms up, where you\u2019ve built tools to allow teams to tell you what AI can do for them.\n\nExactly. In fact, the non-technical folks that are closer to the customers, they talk to them every single day, they actually have a much deeper understanding than an average engineer on what situations the customer can get themselves into, what they\u2019re confused about. So they are actually in a better position than engineers or AI scientists to write the instructions to Gus to solve that problem.\n\nI think other people I\u2019ve talked to have noticed the same thing. The best AI engineers are actually the people that are the domain experts that have learned how to write good prompts.\n\nAs you think about how this plays out over the next few years, do you think the company\u2019s headcount across different teams is going to look pretty similar, or do you think that\u2019ll change over time as AI is deployed across the company?\n\nI think the role does evolve a little bit. I think you\u2019ll see a lot of our CX folks not directly answering questions, but actually writing recipes and doing things like prompt tuning to improve the AI. Everyone\u2019s going to just move up the abstraction layer, and then obviously it will bring more efficiencies to the company and also better customer experience, because they\u2019ll get their questions answered immediately.\n\nAnd that unlocks Gusto to do more things for our customers. There\u2019s a huge roadmap of things that we want to be doing, but we can\u2019t, because we\u2019re constrained in resources."
