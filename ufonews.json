            "article_content": "Dallas County, April 1897\n\n\n\nNewspapers of the day reported the sightings straight-faced, although one can read more than a little tongue-in-cheek writing into some of the dispatches from community correspondents.\n\n\n\nDescriptions of the airships varied somewhat, but there was a general consensus that they had cigar-shaped bodies or cabins 50 to 60 feet long with propellers at each end, large bat-like wings, and huge floodlights fore and aft. Most witnesses saw neither pilot nor crew, but in some cases, not only did observers see people manning the ships, but talked to them. The Dallas Morning News' correspondent at Waxahachie reported a long conversation between Judge Love of the community and an airship crew, which claimed to be from the North Pole.\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Field, 1952\n\n\n\nThere was considerable air traffic in the vicinity (normal Love Field activity) and there was enough light that aircraft were identifiable as the general type when viewed in the southwest, the sun to the rear. I first noticed an orange colored light which appeared to be nothing more than the exhaust or running light of an aircraft. Then, I noticed the light gave off an exhaust trail similar to that of an afterburner. I watched the light in its descending path for about four seconds when it seemed to fire a number of \"rockets\" and vanished.\n\n\n\nUniversity Park, 1961\n\n\n\nAt exactly 4:07 AM CST early Thursday morning, March 9th, I was out in my back yard doing a bit of amateur satelloon watching [a balloon satellite] ....hoping to see the polka-dot 12 footer, and I SAW A BIG, extremely fast, unidentified object streaking from about ENE to SW across the sky. It moved so fast was hard to focus on it, but I DO remember quite a bit of the impression it left on me. This object, seemingly, moved so darn fast that I would never have given it much later thought, except that the 7:00 AM news that morning carried big story that the Russians had orbited a dog, etc. in a 5-ton rocket.\n\nDenton, 2007\n\n\n\nI think I saw a UFO. I am not really sure. I feel like I am kind of crazy for thinking this. I was driving on 35W in Denton, TX around 10:15 a.m. 11/21/07 this morning and when I came over a hill I saw three white things in the sky. It was like 1 mile in front of me, slightly to the right. I wasn't sure if it was the balls that are on powerline to warn airplanes and then I thought it was a reflection the stadium. the balls were white with some silver tint. They were almost a perfect circle, but a little oblong.\n\n\n\nThey were perfectly aligned in a row a little to the left of me looking straight ahead. I was thinking I should take a picture because I thought oh it might be a UFO. I was trying to figure out what it was and the one on the right disapeared and one second later the middle one dissapeared and a little less then one second later the left one dissapeared. It didn't fade out or dart away. It just dissapeared in a split second.\n\n\n\nI am super freaked out right now and I don't know if It was something from Carswell air base or Lockead Martin, but I have NEVER seen anything like this before. It was soooo clear too. Not fuzy at all! PLease let me know if anyone else has seen this one in Denton! I have been very skeptical of UFO sightings, but I am so freaked out and paranoid now!\n\n\n\nIrving, 2021\n\n\n\nThe shiny spinning disc was seen hovering over a golf course before it appeared to have landed on the ground in Irving on April 25.\n\n\n\nFootage was recorded by a man who was visiting the area with his friends. They then saw the strange object reflecting the sunlight from a distance.\n\n\n\nA man was heard saying in the background: \u2018You see that? That\u2019s not a weather balloon, dude, it\u2019s flat.\n\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s moving really weird, it\u2019s like spinning and it\u2019s got another disc inside of it that\u2019s spinning.\u2019\n\n\n\nHe described the object as a \u2018large metallic ring that floated around a separate metallic sphere within the ring, like a flying armillary sphere.\u2019\n\nPilots flying near Dallas Fort Worth International Airport recently reported some suspicious lights floating around that air traffic controllers couldn't spot with their technology. It provoked quite the conversation.Seems UFO sightings is a topic that may never go out of style, especially in North Texas. In fact, a recent study names Texas as one of the top hotspots for UFO sightings in the U.S. Some of the more talked-about UFO sightings in the nation\u2019s history have occurred in other parts of Texas like Levelland, Lubbock and Dayton, for example.It got us to thinking about North Texas\u2019 history with UFO sightings. In case you aren\u2019t aware, it\u2019s neithera rare nor recent phenomenon. This is by no means a comprehensive compendium of North Texas UFO sightings, but here are some of the accounts that stuck out the most to us.UFO sightings in North Texas were all the rage back when ol\u2019 Charles Culberson served as the state\u2019s 21st governor, just 30-plus years removed from the Civil War. According to the Texas Almanac , \u201cbetween April 13 and 17, 1897, there were 38 reported sightings of \u2018airships\u2019 in 23 counties in Texas, including in Denton and Dallas Counties.\"In 2015, the published an article looking at the Dallas UFO sightings mentioned in Project Blue Book, a federal program that subjected reports of UFO sightings to certain scientific analysis. This sighting noted in Project Blue Book caught our eye.Another local example logged in Project Blue Book was intriguing to us. One man who reported a UFO sighting was indeed looking to the sky for something unique, but not for what he says he found.Did you know there\u2019s a National UFO Reporting Center? The center has a website where folks can log their sightings. This account from Denton, reprinted as it appeared, caught our attention, as we could relate to feeling more than a little perplexed at what we think we may have just seen.Look, not all UFO sightings are created equal. Not all accounts are going to get the public all riled up. But here\u2019s one from Irving from only three years ago , and it includes the term \u201c armillary sphere ,\u201d for which we give props. It's a wonderfully on-point description of what we think an alien spacecraft may look like. Plus, there\u2019s a video of it, posted to a website called Newsflare."

            "article_content": "Footage has emerged of what appears to be a 'UFO' hovering in the skies over New Jersey before suddenly accelerating away leaving the family who were watching lost for words.\n\nIn a short 13 second clip posted to social media, a white light can be seen blinking in the sky before suddenly vanishing.\n\nIn the footage which was shot on Sunday night close near Atlantic City, family members can be heard discussing what they are witnessing before suddenly the object disappears.\n\n'It just vanished!' one exclaimed excitedly. 'I just watched it through the telescope,' they said.\n\nThe footage was sent to Tim Janicki by a friend.\n\n'I was starting to lose interest in these #drones #orbs until I received this video from our friends who went out tonight down by the bay. I don't trust random videos I see on X\u2026 but this is 100% real (wait till 4 sec mark),' he wrote.\n\nThe footage generated some interesting comments online with many agreeing that what the family witnessed appeared to be extremely unusual.\n\nThe video is the most recent in a long line of mysterious drone sightings that have been reported flying over New Jersey and across the eastern U.S., sparking speculation and concern over where they came from and why.\n\n'You can see it didn't just disappear but took off with incredible speed, there's a small flash of light to the left as it leaves. Humans can't produce the energy required to go that fast, especially from standstill,' wrote one.\n\nFootage has emerged of what appears to be a ' UFO ' hovering in the skies over New Jersey before suddenly accelerating away leaving the family who were watching lost for words\n\nIn a short 13 second clip posted to social media, a white light can be seen blinking in the sky before suddenly vanishing\n\n'Yeah this is appears to be another genuine one. Exactly what I filmed in the UK. The light dims and moves off left and upwards. If you want me to frame by frame enhance send me the original. I've got a lot of experience doing this analysis for my own sighting,' added another interested observer.\n\n'Send this to some proper Professors. They can make the math if it's moved at all and just freeze in time while the Earth keeps moving. I have a feeling they are just traveling back in time and keep recharging their batteries here on our Nuclear Energy and travel further back,' suggested a third.\n\n'Note: it didn't vanish, it took off at impossibly high speed diagonally up and to the left of frame (about 10 o'clock angle). Using your own logic, we shouldn't believe this video,' added a fourth.\n\n'This is exactly how the orb I saw flew away. That's why I said nothing can move like that. No flight system we have right now can go from stationary to warp drive in an instant. These flight characteristics are... Well beyond light years beyond us,' said another, transfixed.\n\nLast week the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey and 30 areas in New York, mostly in and around New York City and on Long Island, where critical infrastructure is located.\n\nFAA officials said federal security agencies requested the flight restrictions, which are effective through mid-January.\n\nThe FBI, the Homeland Security Department and state agencies have been investigating, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat.\n\nA wave of footage has emerged of the drones since they were first spotted last month including this footage from Bernardsville, New Jersey\n\nSeveral drones appeared to be flying over Randolph, New Jersey earlier this month\n\nAuthorities say many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has said there appears to be nothing nefarious about the flying objects.\n\nDespite federal officials' comments, many state and municipal lawmakers have called for stricter rules about who can fly unmanned aircraft - and for the authority to shoot them down.\n\nDozens of witnesses have reported seeing drones statewide since mid-November, including near the Picatinny Arsenal, a military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump's golf course in Bedminster.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has said drone-detection equipment supplied by the federal government has yielded little new information.\n\nHe declined to describe the equipment except to say it was powerful and could even disable the drones.\n\nThe growing anxiety among some residents is not lost on the Biden administration, which has faced criticism from Trump for not dealing with the matter more aggressively.\n\nSwarms of drones have been spotted in the skies of New Jersey for weeks, sparking officials to call for a 'limited state of emergency'\n\nIn recent months New Jersey has been ravaged by thousands of unexplained drone sightings, as over 5,000 reports of unusual drone prevalence have been filed with law enforcement\n\nWhite House national security spokesperson John Kirby said the federal government has yet to identify any public safety or national security risks.\n\nThe federal government has deployed personnel and advanced technology to investigate the reports in New Jersey and other states, and is evaluating each tip reported by citizens, he said.\n\nAbout 100 of the more than 5,000 drone sightings reported to the FBI in recent weeks were deemed credible enough to warrant more investigation, according to a joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Defense.\n\nSpeculation has raged online, with some expressing concerns the drones could be part of a nefarious plot by foreign agents or clandestine operations by the U.S. government.\n\nDrone activity earlier this month led to an hourlong closure of runways at New York's Stewart International Airport, about 60 miles north of Manhattan, a four-hour closure of air space around Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, and the arrests of two men in Boston accused by police of flying a drone too close to Logan International Airport.\n\nTrump has said he believes the government knows more than it\u00b4s saying.\n\n'Let the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!' he posted on Truth Social.\n\nU.S. Sen. Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, said he has heard nothing to support the notion that the government is hiding anything. He said a lack of faith in institutions is playing a key part in the saga.\n\n'Nothing that I\u00b4m seeing, nothing that I\u00b4ve engaged in gives me any impression of that nature. But like, I get it, some people won\u00b4t believe me, right? Because that's the level of distrust that we face,' Kim said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut last week called for the drones to be 'shot down.'"

            "article_content": "Michael Busby is a Texan who has authored one of the most riveting works of nonfiction you\u2019re ever likely to read, a book destined to stand as a classic in the field of UFO research. Indeed, it offers an answer to the riddle of the earliest wave of UFOs in the modern era. From late 1896 to mid-1897, starting in California and trailing off in the Lone Star State, thousands of witnesses saw strange flying craft in the skies. Solving the 1897 Airship Mystery is at once illuminating, enthralling, and expertly researched.\n\nBefore newspaper headlines about crash debris in Roswell, before pilot Kenneth Arnold\u2019s sighting of \u201cflying saucers\u201d in 1947, even before Zeppelins took to the skies, Americans from all walks of life saw airships passing overhead. These Victorian-era UFOs were reported in thousands of newspaper articles. Farmers, lawyers, ranchers, and doctors all gave eyewitness accounts. Thanks to modern researchers like Busby, these witnesses can now be verified to have been genuine citizens, living in the time and place of their sightings. They spotted mysterious, Jule Verne-like airships. Some even saw the craft land for repairs or to take on water. A few spoke to the crewmen and were even granted tours of the airships. One of the most startling parts of Busby\u2019s book is when the names given to witnesses by the alleged crewmen are verified, like the witnesses themselves, as having been real, flesh-and-blood human beings.\n\nBusby\u2019s work seeks to trace the origins of the airships back to engineers and inventors who came over to America fleeing the German Civil War in the 1840s. After arriving in New York City, some of these brilliant minds partnered with the inventor Dr. Solomon Andrews, who built one of the first airships and successfully demonstrated its flight during the American Civil War. Busby examines the possibility that men who served in the Army of the Potomac became knowledgeable of Dr. Andrews\u2019 craft and in the post-war decades these same men sought to perfect his airship prototype, finally resulting in the astonishing events of 1897.\n\nIf you\u2019re intrigued by tales of UFOs or stories of the strange and mysteries, Solving the 1897 Airship Mystery is indispensable reading. Busby\u2019s careful research, relying on primary sources and inductive reasoning, makes his work stand out from the crowd of ufology books. It serves as nothing less than the key to unriddling the 19th century origins of the modern UFO phenomenon and proof that there are far stranger things in heaven and earth than tales of little green men from Mars.\n\nPhoto: Author Michael Busby\n\nThe book reaches toward a fiery climax with the tale of the 1897 Aurora, Texas airship crash. Students of UFO tales and Texas mysteries alike should be familiar with the newspaper story that claimed an airship, piloted by a \u201cman not of this world,\u201d crashed into a windmill in the small town of Aurora in April 1897. Now you can find out the hidden truth behind the legend! Get your copy here. Read Solving the 1897 Airship Mystery now and discover the Texas location of the airship\u2019s daytime hideout. Busby employs a critical reading of eyewitness accounts, noting time and place, to triangulate the most likely location where the airship was landing during daylight hours.\n\nMichael Busby was born in Montague County, Texas and raised on his great-great grandfather\u2019s ranch near the Red River. When he graduated high school, Busby enlisted in the Marines and went on to serve in Vietnam. His only regret during his time in the corps was not taking advantage of an offer to receive helicopter training. After eight years in the corps, he embarked on a career as a Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency contractor. A soldier and scholar, he received his Bachelor of Science Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas at Dallas and pursued an MBA at the University of Iowa and a software engineering degree from Carnegie Mellon University. His work, often classified, took him through war-torn countries all around the world. In 1979 he had a close call escaping a firing squad south of Tehran. Unable to reach the American embassy for evacuation, he hid out for a time in a foreign embassy, then masquerading as a member of a flight crew, he took a plane out of Iran. Before retiring, he worked at the Naval Air Warfare Center. Busby now lives in the beauty of the Ouachita Mountains of southeastern Oklahoma. His book Solving the 1897 Airship Mystery was the result of many years of deep research and critical analysis. A compelling read, the book is sure to become a classic not only of UFO research but Texas literature as well. Get your copy here and follow Michael Busby on Facebook."

            "article_content": "One of the most significant emerging trends of 2024 has been the interplay between artificial intelligence (AI) and the crypto ecosystem. Historically this has primarily been on the infrastructure side, affecting various layers of the stack such as decentralized compute, storage and model training and inference. However, the last few months the crypto x AI crossover has taken stage front and center as agents have surfaced and are multiplying by the thousands. While the AI agent narrative has taken up a lot of mindshare of late, we've barely scratched the surface of what we're going to see in 2025.\n\nWhat are AI agents?\n\nAI agents are autonomous programs designed to perform specific tasks. This could be as simple as sharing memes on X, all the way to complex on-chain transactions optimizing trade execution or yield farming strategies. Unlike standard bots, AI agents can learn best practices over time and make undefined decisions to meet predefined goals. Think of them as highly skilled, evolving crypto participants capable of navigating the digital economy autonomously.\n\nThe value of AI agents lies not just in their utility but in their potential to scale human capabilities. Agents are no longer just tools \u2014 they are emerging as participants in the on-chain economy, driving innovation across finance, gaming and decentralized social platforms. With protocols such as Virtuals and open-source frameworks like ELIZA, it\u2019s becoming increasingly simple for developers to build, deploy and iterate AI agents that serve an increasingly diverse set of use cases.\n\nEmerging applications of AI agents\n\nThis year offered glimpses of the potential applications for AI agents. From the bizarre rise of the Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT) memecoin to the rapid growth of agent-led experiments, AI agents are beginning to reshape how we interact with technology, culture and finance. Terminal of Truths (ToT) , an AI agent trained on a satirical internet religion, received a grant from prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreesen and amassed over 200,000 followers becoming crypto\u2019s first AI KOL (key opinion leader) and millionaire as it drove $GOAT to a market cap of more than $1 billion.\n\nWhile ToT might feel like an anomaly, it serves as a proof of concept for how AI agents can drive community-building, capture attention and fuel the next generation of on-chain activity. Since then over 11,000 agents have launched on the leading platform Virtuals, which may seem like a lot yet pales in comparison to pump.fun which is averaging 4x that every single day. While most of the agents launched are simple bots that simply propagate memes, we\u2019re also seeing agents such as aixbt, which provides sophisticated investment research, and zerebro, which creates unique digital art. These applications may appear niche, but they offer a glimpse into the growing design space for AI agent innovation.\n\nWhy crypto is the frontline for AI agent development\n\nUnlike the core foundational AI models that are developed behind the walled gardens of OpenAI and Anthropic, AI agents are being innovated in the trenches of the crypto world. And for good reason. Blockchains provide the ideal infrastructure as they offer permissionless and frictionless financial rails, enabling agents to seed wallets, transact and send funds autonomously \u2014 tasks that would be unfeasible using traditional financial systems.\n\nIn addition, the open-source nature of crypto allows developers to leverage existing frameworks to launch and iterate on agents faster than ever before. With more no-code platforms like Top Hat gaining traction, it\u2019s only getting easier for anyone to be able to launch an agent in minutes. Add in the financial incentive in which agents that gain traction tend to have a rise in price similar to your run-of-the-mill memecoin, potentially making the creator huge amounts of money, and you can see how this environment is ripe for attracting talent and accelerating progress.\n\nWhat AI agents will do in 2025\n\nIf 2024 laid the foundation for AI agents, 2025 will be the year they scale. Three trends will drive this evolution:\n\nFirst, agent-to-agent and human-to-agent interactions will proliferate. Decentralized social platforms like Warpcast have already shown how agents can launch tokens, trade autonomously and interact with communities. As tools for creating agents become more accessible, these interactions will become a defining feature of the on-chain experience.\n\nSecond, AI agents will dominate financial activity on-chain. As developers build agents capable of optimizing trades, managing wallets and automating yield strategies, the financial infrastructure of crypto will become increasingly autonomous. Blockchain\u2019s efficiency, combined with agents\u2019 adaptability, will position crypto as the preferred environment for financial AI.\n\nFinally, agent-led ecosystems will reshape gaming and entertainment. Projects like Wayfinder and Echelon Prime\u2019s Parallel Colony point to a future where AI agents not only participate in games but also manage assets, coordinate strategies and drive entire in-game economies. These agents will blur the lines between players, developers and automated participants, creating new dynamics for virtual worlds.\n\nThe rise of AI agents marks a new chapter for both artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. While the applications we\u2019ve seen so far \u2014 from memecoins to agent-led communities \u2014 may feel experimental, they mark a preview of the impact these agents will have as they scale."

            "article_content": "New Delhi: India\u2019s technology sector is likely to see generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) and related data applications define client orders, financial growth and technical innovation in 2025. In turn, this is expected to generate a spurt in demand for data centres and their services.\n\nIndustry stakeholders ranging from the US\u2019s Big Tech firms, as well as data centre and software services companies, are gearing up for a boom in demand amid expectations of easing inflation concerns in the West, and the Indian government\u2019s boost to domestic research and development (R&D) expenditure in the coming year.\n\nOn 12 December, Mint reported that the Centre was evaluating plans to roll out $3 billion in incentives to boost R&D in India. The country, already a hub for fresh technical talent, is now looking to invest in innovation to climb up the value ladder\u2014as opposed to being a usage economy so far.\n\nAlso read | The next great leap in AI is behind schedule and crazy expensive\n\nAt the core of this push is the establishment of generative AI as a key differentiator in the near term, and its impact on data centres.\n\nOn 28 September, Mint reported that the Adani group is likely to pump in $4 billion to establish a net data centre capacity of 1.5GW (gigawatt) within the next two years, a plan that originally had a timeline of five years. This boost is driven by the influx of AI in enterprises, and the anticipated data boom that is expected to come with it.\n\nAshish Arora, chief executive of Bharti Enterprises\u2019 subsidiary Nxtra, also added that the company is investing $600 million to double its net data centre capacity to 400MW (megawatt) by 2026, a chunk of which will be expanded in 2025 itself.\n\nEarlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Yotta Data Services, a subsidiary of the Hiranandani Group, is close to finalizing a $500-million investment through a group of creditors to expand its data centre \u2018parks\u2019, which are already operational in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Greater Noida and Maharashtra\u2019s Navi Mumbai regions.\n\nThe uptick comes even as generative AI has struggled to keep up with its heightened hype of rapidly transforming businesses. Driven by data privacy and copyright concerns, enterprises have largely remained cautious in adopting the technology rapidly through this year.\n\nAlso read | How scammers are using AI this holiday season to steal your money\n\nThe early signs of change, however, are here. On 19 December, Accenture, the world\u2019s largest technology services outsourcing and consultancy firm and a bellwether for India\u2019s $300-billion IT services sector, disclosed $1.2 billion in net new generative AI deals with businesses worldwide. generative AI, thus, comprised 6.4% of total new business during the company\u2019s Q1FY25 period, which in its reporting runs from September to November.\n\nThe first week of January, thus, will be key to see if India\u2019s IT services stalwarts, led by heavyweights Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and HCL Technologies, can keep up with Accenture\u2019s pace of executing generative AI applications with clients.\n\nEarlier this fiscal, K. Krithivasan, chief executive of TCS, had said that the company has a business pipeline worth $1.5 billion for generative AI. During the company\u2019s October earnings call for Q2FY25, Krithivasan further added that the company has 600 active generative AI projects. However, crucially, he declined to comment on the amount of revenue TCS is drawing from AI\u2019s youngest brainchild.\n\nAdoption likely to rise\n\nIndustry stakeholders, however, are bullish that 2025 is likely to see generative AI go on a stronger run of adoption, as the technology itself becomes more mature, and businesses find a way to implement them at the core.\n\nOn 11 December, Google announced its new generation of generative AI models under the Gemini 2.0 suite, underlining its suitability for \u2018agentic\u2019 AI applications, which experts said was a clear sign of the company trying to convince businesses of the technology\u2019s usability.\n\n\u201cAI isn\u2019t just an enabler anymore\u2014it\u2019s becoming the backbone of how industries innovate, scale, and solve their most complex challenges,\" said Sindhu Gangadharan, chairperson of Centre-affiliated think-tank Nasscom, and managing director of SAP Labs India. \u201cAI is evolving from being assistive to becoming truly intelligent, with autonomous agents capable of making decisions and orchestrating entire ecosystems.\n\nGangadharan added that custom AI, in particular, is emerging as a transformative force in 2025, allowing organizations to design AI solutions tailored to their specific needs. \u201cThis trend is set to democratize AI innovation. For India, this is an incredible opportunity\u2014we\u2019re perfectly positioned to lead this AI-driven transformation,\" she said.\n\n\u201cMore organizations are experimenting with building custom AI solutions tailored to industry needs, including custom copilots and AI agents,\" said Irina Ghose, managing director of Microsoft India. She added that Indian enterprises are at the forefront of this shift in scaling AI and data use cases to \u201cdrive innovation, improve productivity and streamline workflows\u2014bringing India on the brink of an AI-driven renaissance\".\n\nAlso read | The AI robots on their way will mostly be made in Asia\n\nGhose further added that as far as generative AI is concerned, there is no doubt that with the right combination of data and associated computing power, businesses across industries can be considerably redefined.\n\n\"2024 was the year of AI in action, and we saw a transformative shift in how companies approach AI, moving from exploration to execution. Increasingly, more and more organizations are experimenting with building custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs, including custom copilots and AI agents. The business opportunity of AI is clear. According to an IDC study, for every dollar a company invests in generative AI, the return on investment is 3.7x. On top of this, 92% of AI deployments are taking 12 months or less at an enterprise level,\" Ghose said.\n\nIpsita Dasgupta, managing director of HP India, said it was important to empower SMBs (small and medium businesses), which contribute about 30% of GDP but face various barriers, with AI technology. \u201cThe future of work means a more flexible, inclusive and digitally connected environment where technology empowers individuals and businesses of all sizes. AI PCs and advanced workstations will be at the core of this change,\" Dasgupta said.\n\nThe key, experts believe, will be in how generative AI grows in the coming year. Pointing out that generative AI is still only a two-year old technology, Jayanth Kolla, partner at tech consultant Convergence Catalyst, said we are still understanding a lot about it.\n\n\u201cThat said, the advent of domain-specific applications through generative AI is a key area of business interest, and whichever way you look at it, the boom in data centre demand is unavoidable in India as a result. As enterprises ramp up AI consumption, this demand will only rise, without any concerns of slowdown or saturation at least in the near-term,\" Kolla said.\n\nThere are also new directions that AI and data centre evolutions can take in the coming year. For AI, much will depend on what the US behemoths of Google, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI will do in the coming year. 2024 already saw reasoning AI make a debut, although the use cases of the latter will only build over time. For data centres, figuring out the energy consumption conundrum will be key, as net-zero and climate change accord targets inch closer.\n\nThe earliest proof of the generative AI pudding, each stakeholder agrees, is likely going to come in the first quarter of the upcoming fiscal\u2014suggesting that the true boom in AI and data centres could take until at least the middle of the year to play out. Despite that, all of them are certain that unlike the promise of 5G or satellite internet, there are no external factors that can stop 2025 from being the year for data centres and generative AI to define India\u2019s tech industries."

However, it\u2019s unclear if this was an isolated case or part of a widespread epidemic in the region.\n\nAlso known as the Black Death, the bubonic plague is one of history\u2019s most infamous diseases in history. It is spread when humans are bitten by fleas that piggyback on rodents\n\nWhen the microbes infect a human host, they ravage the lymphatic system, causing lymph nodes in the groin, underarm, and neck to balloon into swollen masses called buboes (hence the name).\n\n3 A depiction of a plague hospital in Vienna while the city was being besieged by the Turks in 1679. Bettmann Archive\n\nThe disease only snowballs from there, causing complications including seizures, vomiting blood, internal bleeding, and death.\n\nBubonic plague is most often associated with the notorious epidemic in 14th-century Europe \u2014 where it killed around 25 million people between 1347 and 1351 \u2014 as well as subsequent outbreaks in China, Mongolia and India.\n\nAnd while experts have long postulated about the plague\u2019s footprint in Egypt for decades, there hasn\u2019t been solid evidence for it \u2014 until now.\n\nIn 2004, scientists found millennia-old fleas at a repository on the banks of the Nile River.\n\nThere was also a 3,500-year-old Egyptian medical document describing a bubo filled with petrified pus, suggesting that the plague rats may have spread throughout the world by boat.\n\n3 The mummy is housed at the Egyptian Museum of Turin in Turin, Italy.

In its new whitepaper, 101 Technology Trends That Will\u2014and Won't\u2014Shape 2025, analysts from global technology intelligence firm ABI Research. ABI Research analysts identify 54 trends that will shape the technology market and 47 others that, although attracting vast amounts of speculation and commentary, are less likely to move the needle over the next twelve months. In the Digital Payment Technologies space, 2025 will see increased QR code payment acceptance but little growth for payment card IC ASPs.\n\n2024 Logo (PRNewsfoto/ABI Research)\n\n\"2024 has been marked by challenges, from global conflicts and inflationary pressures to political uncertainty. These factors have strained enterprise and consumer spending, leading to market inertia, short-term technology investments, sidelined capital, and the exposure of vulnerable suppliers,\" says Stuart Carlaw, Chief Research Officer at ABI Research. \"From a technology perspective, many industries and end markets are in that awkward stage of technology adoption where they are formulating implementation strategies, assessing solutions and partners, and trying to see if they have the resources needed to roll out solutions at scale. This is a particularly sensitive time, which tends to suggest 2025 will have tech implementers and end users on the brink of a period of a massive technology shift as they work through these issues.\"\n\nWhat Will Happen in 2025:\n\nQR code payment acceptance will continue to increase with use cases expanding\n\nAlthough QR code payment acceptance is prevalent in countries such as China and growing in emerging digital payment markets, including in India, use cases and potential growth areas are not limited to these countries. Significant and continued investments by vendors, including PayPal, Stripe, and SumUp, are setting the foundation for increased adoption in other mature and established economies with use cases expanding. Although QR codes are already being used by many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and pop-up retail businesses, 2025 will mark the year when the technology begins to shift from one niche to partial mainstream.\n\nWhat Won't Happen in 2025:\n\nPayment card IC ASPs will not return to pre-COVID-19 levels\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, chipset pricing has been on a continual rise, driven by increased pricing in myriad manufacturing areas, including energy, raw material, transit pricing, and inflation, driving up wages. The chip shortage further compounded this, and according to ABI Research, the Average Selling Price (ASP) for a payment card Integrated Circuit (IC) increased by approximately +30% between 2020 and 2023. However, despite pricing pressures returning, the cost of payment ICs is some years away from matching pre-COVID-19 levels. Although 2025 will mark another year of pricing deprecation, it will not be until around 2028 when pricing is expected to drop to levels similar to those achieved in 2019 steadily.\n\nStory Continues"

            "article_content": "Nestle Vietnam has set its sights to capitalise on rising demand for convenient beverage options in the country to drive the growth of its Nescafe a ready-to-serve liquid concentrate.\n\nAccording to the firm, Nescafe stepped up its format and product innovation to keep up with the latest trends and consumer demands.\n\n\u201cVietnam, in particular, is a country with a very rich coffee culture, and there have also been some novel popular trends emerging over the past few years,\u201d Nestle Vietnam Business Executive Officer Mostafa Youssef told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\n\u201cCold coffee tends to be more popular here, and interestingly there has also been a movement towards liquid coffees \u2013 which is why we have recently launched a new innovation in the form of a coffee concentrate in a stick.\n\n\u201cThe convenience factor is strong with these as all consumers need to do is open up the coffee stick, pour over ice \u2013 and that\u2019s all done, they can enjoy a very quick cup of coffee with no need to source hot water to dissolve powder or dilute the coffee unless they want to.\u201d\n\nFoodNavigator-Asia has asked experts in India to weigh in with recommendations for India\u2019s spice sector bounce back from two high profile contamination scandals this year.\n\nCarcinogenic ethylene oxide is a pesticide that was found in spice powders from major Indian brands Everest and MDH, putting the country\u2019s spice industry under intense scrutiny.\n\nThis has led to bans in Hong Kong and the Maldives, product recalls in Singapore, and stricter checks on India\u2019s spices in Australia and the US.\n\nDespite the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) emphasising its stringent regulations, overseas bans and domestic concerns raised questions about the effectiveness of these measures.\n\nFollowing the Hong Kong ban on 5 April, FSSAI issued a statement on 8 April that raised the maximum residue limits (MRL) of pesticides by 10 times from 0.01mg/kg to 0.1mg/kg.\n\nAlthough FSSAI clarified that these only applies to pesticides not registered with the Indian authorities, and that the international Codex standards were adhered to, it sparked criticism and confusion.\n\n\u201cIt does seem counterintuitive for the FSSAI to increase the MRL for pesticides not registered with authorities, especially considering the potential health implications,\u201d Equinox Labs CEO Ashwin Bhadri said.\n\n\u201cThe implications of such a decision could be significant, as it may lead to increased pesticide residues in food products, potentially impacting consumer health in the long term.\n\n\u201cIt may also raise doubts about the effectiveness of regulatory measures in ensuring food safety and quality.\u201d\n\nThe Indonesian government has revised food packaging regulations in response to consumer and academic concerns over the presence of dangerous chemicals entering the food supply chain.\n\nAs of 2023, Indonesia had no specific regulations in place regarding certain harmful chemicals such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), more commonly known as the \u2018Forever Chemicals\u2019 due to their slow degradation rate.\n\nA great deal of scientific evidence already linked PFAS exposure to an array of health issues from cancer, cardiovascular disease, infertility, elevated blood pressure and more.\n\n\u201cIndonesia currently has no regulations on PFAS in food packaging [but] the troubling findings from our study indicate that we need stronger regulations to protect our children and families from exposures to toxic PFAS chemicals especially in daily products,\u201d Nexus3 Senior Advisor Yuyun Ismawati said whilst announcing the study findings.\n\n\u201cPFAS can also be released when people wear clothing, during washing, and when used synthetic textile wastes are disposed \u2013 [this] can contaminate waterways, leading to PFAS exposures from contaminated drinking water or food.\u201d\n\nFoodNavigator-Asia took a closer look at five of the top trends affecting the Asia Pacific food and beverage industry in 2024.\n\nThese included the \u2018premium affordability\u2019 trend surfaced by many food firms, as well as the evolution of plant-based protein to moving away from mimicry in innovation.\n\nOther significant trends included the rise of ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages driven by convenience and relatability, the continuous rise of low-to-no alcohol, and major factors behind the growth of the snacking industry.\n\nThe European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) has faced major pushback from ministers and trade organisations within Europe, as well as alongside continued pressure from palm oil producer nations in Asia this year.\n\nOn March 28 2024, an industry-wide cross-commodity letter was addressed to EC President of the Council for Environment and Minister for the Climate, the Environment, Sustainable Development and the Green Deal of Belgium Zakia Khattabi, calling for \u2018urgent clarifications and workable solutions\u2019 on EUDR implementation.\n\nThis was signed by a coalition of more than 20 European industry organisations spanning many areas of trade, including representatives on food trade in cereals, oils, rice, livestock, meat and more \u2013 all highlighting concerns over the supposed enforcement in December 2024.\n\n\u201cConsidering the significant adjustments that are needed from suppliers, operators and traders, we would like to express serious concerns regarding the pace of preparation of EUDR-related legislative acts, the mandatory systems and the guidance and clarifications required for implementation,\u201d the coalition said in the letter, which FoodNavigator-Asia has viewed.\n\n\u201cOperators and traders are working hard to prepare their supply chains and adapt their systems and due diligence processes for compliance with the EUDR [and] try to develop workable solutions compatible with the EUDR provisions.\n\n\u201cHowever, these efforts are impeded by large gaps in information, lack of appropriate technical solutions and by misconceptions as to the functioning of our complex chains.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean government has planned to mandate label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, replacing this with a digital QR code system over the next two years.\n\nSouth Korea committed to a range of sustainability goals, including the slashing of plastic waste production by 50% and the doubling of recycling rates in the country from 34% to 70%, both by 2030.\n\nThis year\u2019s developments saw the ministry calling for public comment on an initiative to mandate the use of label-free packaging for drinking water bottles, to be implemented after a two-year transition period.\n\n\u201cIn order to reduce the amount of label waste in the country from drinking water bottles and improve the efficiency of recycling systems locally, we will introduce a new label-free QR code system for all such bottles,\u201d MoE said via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cFrom January 1 2026, all individual types of drinking water bottles such as mineral waters that are manufactured in Korea will be subject to this change.\n\n\u201cAs the label-free QR code display method is mandated for target audiences, we aim to start with a smooth trial operation and early conversion [in order to] reflect any industry difficulties regarding displaying any necessary sales information via the QR code, as well as to determine the scope for product promotion and advertising.\u201d\n\nGlobal food corporation Cargill has leveraged its cocoa-sourcing networks in Asia and other business units to support customers in overcoming the cocoa supply shortage, and ensure consumers continue to have access to chocolate products.\n\nAccording to the International Cocoa Organization, global cocoa supply is projected to decline by nearly 11% to 4.449m tonnes in the 2023-2024 season, compared with 2022-23.\n\nThis is primarily caused by \u201ccatastrophic harvests\u201d in Ghana and Ivory Coast, which are responsible for over 60% of the world\u2019s cocoa supply.\n\nIn the face of this crisis, Cargill has drawn on its extensive cocoa sourcing networks and innovation expertise to help customers address current challenges, and ensure consumers still get to enjoy chocolate products.\n\n\u201cCocoa supply is indeed a pressing issue for the industry. Cargill is a bean-to-bar solutions provider, which means that we have the capabilities to innovate along every step of the value chain, from sourcing of raw materials to product customisation and solutions provision. For example, we are able to provide Asian-sourced cocoa products as we source globally.\n\n\u201cRight now, we are actively reaching out to our customers to see if they need support in managing this situation, such as sourcing, alternative recipes and product trials. We are able to tailor-make cocoa powder for a certain flavour and colour, and combine different ingredients to create new solutions or replacements,\u201d Xiaoling Liu, Indulgence Leader, Food Solutions Asia Pacific at Cargill, told FoodNavigator-Asia.\n\nThe EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) has faced pressure from within its own Parliament to postpone implementation as an \u2018urgent\u2019 matter this year, with concerns over key trade commodities such as palm oil and cocoa.\n\nThe EUDR received much criticism particularly from palm oil industry experts and countries producing key commodities likely to be affected such as palm oil, cocoa and coffee, and came under fire from within the EU parliament as well.\n\nThis dissent was led by European Peoples\u2019 Party (EPP) environmental spokesperson Peter Liese, who pushed for an \u2018urgent\u2019 postponement and \u2018far less bureaucratic\u2019 implementation of the EUDR.\n\n\u201cThe goal of the EUDR is correct, but its implementation is far too bureaucratic [and] the European Commission absolutely must postpone the entry into force of the deforestation regulation, then use the transitional period to reduce bureaucracy in the text,\u201d he said via a formal statement.\n\n\u201cWe must do something about deforestation worldwide and take our responsibility seriously, [however] the regulation has been turned into a bureaucratic monster - Many small farmers around the world and even small forest owners in the European Union cannot work with the text.\n\n\u201cThe preparatory work that the Commission should have carried out has not been done [and many] countries are complaining massively about the legislation, including countries that are pursuing the same goal as we are, namely to stop deforestation.\n\nAs of time of writing, the EUDR implementation has been postponed to the end of 2025.\n\nResearchers in India have highlighted that the misuse of antibiotics in food animal production in Asia could pose a serious danger to public health in the region.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a significant global threat, causing substantial economic losses and an estimated annual loss of 700,000 lives.\n\nResearchers at the Veterinary and Animal Sciences University in Punjab noted the alarming rise of antibiotic resistance and its potential transmission to humans through the food chain.\n\nThey also shed light on the pervasive use of critically important antibiotics in food animal production across Asia as well as how limited surveillance and regulatory controls had amplified concerns over antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe study encompassed 11 WHO member countries \u2014 Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, North Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste.\n\nResults from the review of 108 selected publications revealed a staggering 1,126 scientific publications on antibiotic use in food animals, wherein the study identified a concerning trend of antibiotic misuse in livestock, poultry and aquaculture.\n\nChina\u2019s removal of tariffs on all dairy products from New Zealand has been posited to spell huge potential for brands with a strong focus on quality and sustainability.\n\nChina and New Zealand signed a free trade agreement (FTA) in 2008, but with regard to dairy it took 16 years to finally see all tariffs removed.\n\nAccording to New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade data, New Zealand was the first developed country in the world to enter into an FTA with China.\n\nVarious New Zealand dairy products have seen export tariff decreases over the years, but although many of these hit zero in 2019, duties were still in place for liquid milk, butter and cheese until 2021; and for milk powder until Dec 31 2023.\n\nAs of Jan 1 this year, all tariffs were officially declared to have been removed by the Chinese Embassy in New Zealand via a formal statement, which was warmly welcomed by New Zealand Trade Minister Todd McClay.\n\n\u201cAll safeguard duties on milk powder [entering China] have been removed as of January 1 2024, which marks the final liberalisation of dairy access under the [China-New Zealand] FTA,\u201d McClay announced via a separate statement."

The musical accompaniment of the films is organically intertwined with a familiar Christmas motif known worldwide as Carol of the Bells. The American composer John Williams arranged it especially for the movie. But this is only one version: Carol of the Bells can be heard in classical, jazz and even heavy metal arrangements. From the popular violinist Lindsey Stirling and the the Pentatonix cappella choir to the cult R&B band Destiny\u2019s Child with its lead singer Beyonc\u00e9, there is a fair number of those who have performed this piece. Without Carol of the Bells, it would be hard to conceive Christmas not only in America but all over the world.\n\nThat said, not everyone knows that this \u201cChristmas soundtrack\u201d was first performed on American soil a little over a centenary ago. And that it was written on Ukrainian soil. The exact time and place are unknown because the roots of the work date back to the ancient pre-Christian era. Back then, knowing nothing about the birth of Jesus, we celebrated the New Year in spring, when the first birds began to return from the south. That\u2019s how this line came about: \u201cShchedryk, shchedryk, shchedrivochka, a little swallow flew.\u201d People used to greet each other with these songs, wishing each other all the best for the coming year. Both faith and calendars have changed, but these words, along with a simple four-note musical motif, have survived in folk traditions.\n\nThe modern era has brought the fashion of recording and publishing folklore. However, the elusive Shchedryk did not feature on the pages of ethnographic collections for a long time, as if biding its time. But just a few years later, at the beginning of the 20th century, a series of fantastic events took place when, thanks to the energy of young artists from different parts of Ukraine, this ancient code conquered the whole world.\n\nThe shchedrivka (a traditional carol sang on New Year\u2019s eve) was first heard in his native village of Krasnopil (now the Berdychiv district of the Zhytomyr region) and recorded by the writer Klym Polishchuk, who was one of the famous representatives of the Executed Renaissance (a literary and artistic generation of Ukrainians exterminated during the Soviet times). In 1913, he published this folk gem in the Collection of the Best Ukrainian Songs with Notes, thus becoming the first to pave the triumphant way for Shchedryk.\n\nThe editor of the 1913 collection was the famous Kyiv composer and conductor Oleksandr Koshyts. At that time, he was the head of the student choir of St. Volodymyr\u2019s University (now the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv). Preoccupied with the search for new repertoire for the choir, Koshyts maintained ties with many Ukrainian composers of the time who were preparing high-quality arrangements of folk songs. One of the most brilliant composers among Oleksandr Koshyts\u2019s acquaintances was Mykola Leontovych from Podillia, an ordinary teacher who devoted his entire life to the development of Ukrainian choral art. Wherever his fate took him \u2014 whether to Tulchyn in the Vinnytsia region or to Hryshyn in the Donetsk region (the modern city of Pokrovsk, near which fierce battles with Russian aggressors are now taking place) \u2014 he created folk singing group of children, peasants and workers. Leontovych\u2019s arrangements of folk songs being already well known in Ukraine at that time, Oleksandr Koshyts did not hesitate to send him the collection to let his colleague look for a source of inspiration in it.\n\nAt that time, Mykola Leontovych himself felt an urgent need for new work. Although the composer was already in his thirties, he did not stop taking private lessons in music theory. Nowadays, this would be called a successful example of lifelong learning, a popular (and necessary) approach in contemporary pedagogy. For Leontovych, however, it was not just another fashionable expression but a need to constantly improve his skills.\n\nLeontovych\u2019s mentor was his peer, a talented music teacher from Kharkiv, Boleslav Yavorskyi. It was he who revealed to his student the richness of the creative heritage of European composers, especially Johann Sebastian Bach. Learning was not always easy: for a long time, Leontovych considered the composition of folk songs with their verse logic inviolable, did not approve of\u0456 \u201chandling the material liberally,\u201d so Yavorskyi had to invent new tasks to unleash the composer\u2019s creative potential to a greater extent. Here is how Yavorskyi described his pedagogical approach: \u201cThe tune should be only a \u2018starting point\u2019 for the development of the material, the tune should dissolve into the melody of the melody \u2014 the melody that the composer creates.\u201d Therefore, Leontovych\u2019s next home assignment was to remake a folk song in such a way that the constant motif varied, changed and was supplemented with new sounds and supporting voices during each repetition.\n\nThe homework stretched on for years as Mykola Leontovych was very thorough and self-critical. It was not until 1913 that he saw the material he was looking for in the said collection \u2014 the melody of Shchedryk, which in the folk version consisted of only four notes. And it was here that the composer\u2019s talent was revealed: he actually created a completely independent work in which he ingeniously combined the spirit of Ukrainian folklore and the principles of academic music.\n\nFinally satisfied with the result of his creative search, Leontovych sent his Shchedryk to Oleksandr Koshyts. The latter, having appreciated the work with a masterful eye, immediately learned it with the university choir. And at the end of December 1916, just in time for the Christmas and New Year\u2019s cycle of holidays, Kyiv residents listened with bated breath to the musical magic of Shchedryk. It resembled a glimmer of light that dispersed the heavy clouds of World War I that was in full swing.\n\nYou can\u2019t always believe in coincidence, but this was the case when the sounds of Shchedryk awakened the ancient spirit of the people. No wonder there is a saying: \u201cThe way you meet the New Year is the way you will spend it.\u201d The following year, 1917, turned out to be extremely encouraging and decisive for our country: the \u201cprison of nations,\u201d the Russian Empire, collapsed, and Ukraine regained its statehood. Not only did its laws and authorities begin to take shape, but so did its educational, scientific and artistic institutions. Ukrainians were able to freely create and develop everything they had been deprived of for a century and a half. In the tumultuous year of 1919, the Ukrainian Republican Chapel was founded by the renowned composer Oleksandr Koshyts with the support of the leader of Ukraine, Symon Petliura. This became part of the cultural diplomacy of the young state: it was necessary to show the whole world, especially the leading Western powers, that Ukraine was not an \u201cinvention of the Austrian General Staff,\u201d as the Moscow imperialists stubbornly argued, but a country with ancient historical roots and an incredible original culture. Soon, the Republican Chapel\u2019s grand tour began: Prague, Brussels, Paris, Vienna \u2014 Oleksandr Koshyts\u2019 team was greeted with enthusiasm everywhere. Of course, the director of the chapel used mostly works he was already familiar with, and among them all, Shchedryk evoked a tremendous response in the hearts of Europeans. As one Belgian newspaper noted, \u201cThe success of the premiere concert was resounding. At the request of the insistent audience, the Christmas carol Shchedryk and two folk songs had to be performed as an encore, so conductor Koshyts had to bring his singers on stage again.\u201d The only thing that was upsetting was the difficult title. \u201cStrong women sobbed like men because they could not pronounce the title of one of the most beautiful songs on the program, Shchedryk,\u201d a London newspaper wrote.\n\nAnd then Shchedryk, together with the Ukrainian Republican Chapel, crossed the Atlantic Ocean to bring the uniqueness of Ukrainian music to American audiences. For two months, they performed in more than 30 cities in the United States. The most important performance took place at Carnegie Hall, New York in October 1922. Many American homes probably continued hearing the melodious Shchedryk being sung by enthusiastic listeners later.\n\n\u0421\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e DALL\u00b7E \u043f\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0443 ZN.UA\n\nThe outlook in Ukraine at that time, however, was becoming increasingly gloomy. Russian communists and monarchists were taking turns destroying its freedom. In the midst of the Republican Chapel\u2019s tour in January 1921, Mykola Leontovych, the author of Shchedryk, was murdered by a Bolshevik agent in his parents\u2019 house in Podillia: the enormous success of his work abroad clearly displeased the new occupiers. And the following year, shortly after the triumph of the Republican Chapel in America, Ukraine was deprived of its independence and drawn into the Soviet Union. Subsequently, during Stalin\u2019s \u201cgreat terror,\u201d Klym Polishchuk, the discoverer of Shchedryk, was shot dead in the notorious Sandarmokh tract. This was a deliberate attempt to erase the Ukrainian cultural code.\n\nBut Shchedryk had gotten such a firm foothold on American soil that it continued its cultural and diplomatic mission even in times of statelessness. During the tour of the Republican Chapel, among many other listeners, it was heard by Petro (Peter) Wilhousky, the son of Ukrainian migrants who was also fond of choral singing. It was Wilhousky who, thanks to new technologies, gave Shchedryk\u2019s popularity a second wind. While working for the NBC radio company, in 1936 he came up with an English text for Leontovych\u2019s music. That\u2019s how Carol of the Bells came to be because the high notes that the piece is so rich in reminded Wilhousky of the sound of Christmas bells, those same Jingle Bells sung about in another Christmas song. Thus, the work became even closer and more understandable to the English-speaking audience. Wilhousky\u2019s text was not a translation of the Ukrainian original source, but it also reflected a positive and bright mood on the eve of the holiday. And it was this message that the NBC Symphony Orchestra sought to convey to Americans during the daunting years of World War II, which soon spread across the globe. In this way, Shchedryk healed wounded souls not only in Ukraine but also across the ocean. As it continues to do today, giving hope in an era of despondency, wars and pandemics.\n\nThe secret of Shchedryk is its profound simplicity, musical skill and versatility, which have allowed the work to become a true masterpiece of the global scale. The attention to it is enormous. In particular, in the now frontline town of Pokrovsk, to which Mykola Leontovych devoted many years of his life, creativity and organizational talent. Before the full-scale Russian invasion, the Shchedryk Fest all-Ukrainian chor competition took place here, and the very swallow that inspired this incredible story was even added to the updated city coat of arms. May the winged messengers of revival and peaceful skies come to this suffering soil, as well as to the entire Ukrainian land. And may the eternal Ukrainian Shchedryk be heard in hundreds of different languages all over the world, on Christmas Eve.\n\nShare\n\nNoticed an error?

            "article_content": "Although the bubonic plague is most often associated with its deadly impact on 14th century Europe, traces of Yersinia pestis have also been found in skeletons found in modern-day Russia dating as far back as 5,000 years ago. Thanks to recent analysis, however, researchers believe they have confirmed the first known plague case outside Eurasia: a 3,290-year-old, ancient Egyptian mummy.\n\nY. pestis, also known as the Black Death, is one of history\u2019s most notorious diseases. Usually transmitted by fleas hitching a ride on rodents, the bubonic plague attacks the lymphatic system, and initially results in flu-like symptoms a few days after infection. From there, things often get far more grim\u2014and fatal. Lymph nodes in the groin, underarm, and neck begin to painfully swell while the infected victim develops a high-grade fever, chills, and even seizures. Hematemesis (vomiting blood) sets in, along with the swollen lymph nodes developing into buboes that often rupture. Internal hemorrhaging causes large portions to bruise and turn necrotic\u2014symptoms that earned the plague its \u201cBlack Death\u201d moniker. Without proper modern antibiotic treatments, 30-90 percent of patients can ultimately die as a result of the disease.\n\nApart from its spread through Europe between 1346 and 1353, the bubonic plague is believed to be the root cause of the Eastern Roman Empire\u2019s Plague of Justinian in the 6th century CE, as well as a third epidemic that occurred across China, Mongolia, and India in 1855. But as researchers explained during a presentation at the European Meeting of the Paleopathology Association, Y. pestis is confirmed to have existed at least at one point in ancient Egypt, as well.\n\nThe team reached their conclusion after examining a mummy housed in Italy\u2019s Museo Egizio that dates back to the Second Intermediate Period or early New Kingdom. According to researchers, DNA extracted from both intestinal contents and bone tissue contained traces of Y. pestis, implying the victim endured an advanced stage of the plague before dying.\n\nGet the Popular Science newsletter Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\n\u201cThis is the first reported prehistoric Y. pestis genome outside Eurasia, providing molecular evidence for the presence of plague in ancient Egypt,\u201d the team wrote in their presentation abstract.\n\nExperts have theorized about the bubonic plague\u2019s presence in ancient Egypt for decades. As IFL Science notes, a research team in 2004 found millennia-old fleas at an archeological site in Amarna on the banks of the Nile River. This, coupled with a 3,500-year-old Egyptian medical text known describing \u201ca bubo [whose] pus has petrified,\u201d led scientists to believe the Black Death arrived in communities along the riverbanks thousands of years ago. But without any direct evidence of Y. pestis, the theory remained unproven. The discovery of bubonic plague remnants in mummy DNA, however, appears to finally provide proof of its existence in ancient Egypt.\n\nThe team can\u2019t be sure how widespread Y. pestis was in the region just yet, but they hope their findings will help others \u201cstudy virulence-associated genes, and to characterize its possible modes of transmission and pathology.\u201d"

            "article_content": "Earlier this month, researchers announced they found the smallest asteroids ever detected within the main belt, which is a field between Mars and Jupiter where millions of asteroids orbit. With this discovery, scientists say they can now identify and track asteroids that are likely to approach Earth more accurately and efficiently.\n\nEvery few years, an asteroid roughly the size of a bus \u2014 or a Boston Duck Tour boat \u2014 can strike Earth and send shockwaves through entire regions, researchers say. Now, a key advancement in planetary defense has been made by astronomers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other researchers, authorities said.\n\nOn the morning of June 30, 1908, an asteroid plunged into Earth\u2019s atmosphere and exploded over Siberia, Russia, creating a blast zone nearly three times the size of Chicago. In 2013, an asteroid unleashed a loud sonic boom and shockwave over Chelyabinsk, Russia that injured hundreds and damaged thousands of buildings.\n\n\u201cWe now have a way of spotting these small asteroids when they are much farther away, so we can do more precise orbital tracking, which is key for planetary defense,\u201d Artem Burdanov, the study\u2019s lead-author and research scientist at MIT, said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearchers have now located more than 100 new \u201cdecameter\u201d asteroids, asteroids tens of meters in size, in the main asteroid belt, according to a paper published in Nature. These \u201cdecameter\u201d asteroids are more likely to escape the main asteroid belt and plunge into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nRichard Binzel, research co-author and MIT professor of planetary science, said astronomers usually alert the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge of any detected objects approaching Earth.\n\n\u201cOnce those observations are at [the center], everyone can see those observations... and try to identify if the object will collide with Earth and where it will happen,\u201d Binzel said in an interview last week.\n\nA comparison of how many asteroids can now be detected with the team\u2019s detection method. Ella Maru/Julien de Wit\n\nUntil now, the smallest asteroids astronomers have been able to detect are around one kilometer, which is 1000 meters, researchers said. With this breakthrough, astronomers can now spot asteroids as small as 10 meters.\n\n\u201cThis is a totally new, unexplored space we are entering, thanks to modern technologies,\u201d Burdanov said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study\u2019s lead astronomers used data from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and \u201crecycled\u201d an image processing technique originally used to search for exoplanets to search for asteroids, researchers said.\n\n\u201cJWST has been observing the sky with extreme precision to do exoplanetary science, which is what we usually do, but it just so happens that we can use its unparalleled data to find the smallest asteroid in the main belt ever,\u201d Julien de Wit, research co-author and MIT professor of planetary science, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nDe Wit referenced the asteroid that exploded over Chelyabinsk in 2013, stating that it had only been spotted a mere 12 hours before it collided with Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This is the asteroid that prompted NASA to form a Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) in 2016.\n\nNow, with the researchers\u2019 discoveries, astronomers can detect decameter asteroids much further in advance.\n\n\u201cWith new technology, we can find populations of asteroids that were inaccessible previously,\u201d De Wit said. \u201c...Now we have the capability to be able to study this object further out, predict the orbit with much better accuracy, and decide what to do for potential or possible future impactors.\u201d\n\nSabrina Lam can be reached at sabrina.lam@globe.com."

            "article_content": "Table of Contents Table of Contents How to activate Notification Cooldown on your Android 16 smartphone Notification Cooldown is only available in the Android 16 beta\n\nManaging notifications is no easy task, especially when one tries to maintain the delicate balance between a no-interruption work mindset and the fear of missing out on important alerts. This not only applies to personal communication, but workplace interactions as well. A barrage of notifications can be overwhelming, especially if there are active group chats or users are working across multiple professional circles.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nDifficulty Easy Duration 5 minutes What You Need Smartphone running the Android 16 beta\n\nWith Android 16, Google offers a balancing act courtesy of a new feature called Notification Cooldown that slows the avalanche of notifications. This feature first appeared in the early builds of Android 15, but was subsequently pulled from the stable release. Now, it has again resurfaced in the first developer preview of Android 16.\n\nHow to activate Notification Cooldown on your Android 16 smartphone\n\nThe core idea here is that if an app is sending multiple notifications in a row, the first one will elicit an alert, as usual, while the subsequent notifications from the same app will be gradually reduced in volume.\n\nWith that, Google may have finally created a fuss-free way of making chained notifications less vexing. If that sounds like an intriguing premise, just follow these steps to experience the same nirvana on your Android phone.\n\nStep 1: Open the Settings app.\n\nStep 2: Scroll down and select Notifications.\n\nStep 3: On the next page, you will find the Notification Cooldown option under the General banner.\n\nStep 4: All you have left to do is flick the toggle corresponding to the Notification Cooldown feature.\n\nNotification Cooldown is only available in the Android 16 beta\n\nNotification cooldown first appeared during the early testing phase of Android 15, but it was inexplicably pulled from the stable release channel. It has yet to make a comeback on devices running Android 15, either the vanilla Pixel builds or third-party skins from different brands.\n\nRight now, it is only available on phones running the Developer Preview of Android 16. This build is only available to a handful of Google Pixel phones and the Pixel tablet.\n\nYou can download Android 16 right now, but only through the Developer Preview. It is, however, advised that users wait at least for the public beta updates of Android 16, as the Developer Preview is likely to have a lot of performance and optimization issues, as well as being fairly tough to install. Of course, it's always risky installing any beta software on a device, especially if it's not a spare, as bugs are common. And while bricking a phone completely is fairly rare, it's not unheard of. So, if you don't have a device you're willing to risk, it's almost always worth waiting until the final release of any new operating system software.\n\nNotification Cooldown is a neat convenience, but it makes an exception for more pressing alerts, such as calls, alarms, reminders, and priority conversations. Also, keep in mind that this feature only silences repetitive alerts for a span of two minutes.\n\nMore importantly, these gradually silenced notifications are not lost. Instead, they are simply grouped together under a unified app banner in the notifications shade. You can still access them all by simply tapping on the app\u2019s banner to open each one in the same order as they appeared."

            "article_content": "With the global population aging, and rising concerns about mental health, loneliness, and social isolation, understanding and enhancing later-life satisfaction has become increasingly crucial for both individual and global health and productivity. The World Health Organization1 reports that by 2030, one out of six people will be 60 years or older, comprising 1.4 billion people, with those over 80 approaching half a billion.\n\nGiven the vast scope of this issue, it's surprising that we have a limited understanding of what preserves and enhances generativity in our later years, as research to date is still early-on. Along similar lines, increased generativity would be expected to enhance well-being, and protect against many of the negative outcomes currently associated with aging. With the global population getting older and the average human lifespan increasing, it is imperative to work out how to extend healthspan and productivity, meaning, purpose and community.\n\nDeveloping Machine Learning Approaches to Understand Complex Problems\n\nA recent study by Mohsen Joshanloo, Ph.D., published in the Journals of Gerontology (2024), took a novel approach using machine learning to extract key variables from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) dataset. This study included a wide range of psychological and demographic variables and measured generativity using the Loyola Generativity Scale. Participants ranged from 39 to 93 years old, with an average age of 63.64. Using maching learning allows us to make sense out of complicated data sets where standard statistical approaches may falter.\n\nFrom a broad perspective, a few key concepts help us understand aging across the lifespan. These include Erik Erikson\u2019s developmental model, especially Middle and Older Adulthood (below, with some flexibilty on the age spans given how long we're living nowadays); the balance of stability and plasticity (contributing to consistency and change); and the two major forms of well-being\u2014eudaimonic (meaning) and hedonic (pleasure), which need to be in harmony. Personality traits, measured by the Big Five (Five Factor Model, or FFM), play a role in this process, with some contributing to stability or plasticity. For example, openness to experience is linked with plasticity, while neuroticism, because of an anxious reluctance to take risks, is often associated with stability.\n\nSource: Robert.G Sacco, CC BY-SA 4.0 / Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe study used a \"Random Forest Analysis\" machine learning technique. This method builds multiple decision trees to sift through large datasets, identifying non-linear relationships and dynamic interactions. The model was trained on a subset of data and then tested against the rest to minimize prediction error and enhance accuracy. It analyzed 34 variables for 2,830 participants, after removing those with missing data and reducing the original 70 variables to a set of non-redundant measures.\n\nThe final model predicted 40% of the variance in generativity, revealing five key factors as the strongest predictors, ranked by significance:\n\nSocial Potency: Assertiveness, persuasion, and leadership orientation are crucial. Generativity is inherently social, requiring not just drive but also the interpersonal skills to lead and influence others. Openness: Mental flexibility and the ability to entertain new ideas and experiences are the second strongest predictors. This is consistent with the personality trait openness to experience, which has also been linked to giftedness2. Social Integration: This factor emphasizes the importance of social function in generativity. Beyond leadership, the ability to be part of a group, experience belonging, and find one\u2019s place in the social order is also critical. Social integration protects against loneliness, and the ill effects on health. Personal Growth: The drive for continuous development, particularly in later life, is another important contributor to generativity. As people age and face existential challenges, this drive to grow becomes even more significant. Achievement Orientation: The drive and passion to pursue goals is a key factor in generativity. A strong desire to get things done is inherently generative, though without the other factors, it may lack deeper meaning.\n\nAdditional important factors include a sense of purpose in life and self-acceptance, which highlight the importance of living a meaningful life (eudaimonia) and having a coherent life narrative. Generativity is influenced by how we view ourselves against the backdrop of our life story. Spiritual experiences also emerged as a relevant factor, pointing to the role of transcending quotidian concerns to see ourselves within a broader context.\n\nFactors that were not significant in this model included demographic and health factors such as gender, health status, and socioeconomic variables. While these factors have been important predictors of well-being and life satisfaction in other studies, the machine learning analysis suggests they may not be the most crucial drivers of generativity, though they likely influence the key factors mentioned above. They may be necessary but not sufficient for generativity, perhaps accomplishments from earlier stages of life and provision of basic needs, providing stability and an all-important springboard for generativity into later life.\n\nBecause the dataset is cross-sectional, the results are correlational rather than causal. Future research using machine learning approaches such as Random Forest Analysis, and others, could look at longitudinal data sets to determine causality and further explore additional variables that may influence generativity. Hybrid intelligence, synergizing human and artificial minds to go beyond the capacity of either alone, holds promise for addressing knotty problems.\n\nLiving Large\n\nWhile the jury is still out, this study identifies important factors which, beyond their statistical significance, make a certain intuitive sense when contemplating how to flourish and increase generativity as we grow older. Rather than fading away, focusing on social factors including both leadership and belonging emerges as important. Cultivating mental flexibility and openness to experience are core. Stability is important, but in excess may lead to stagnation, and failure to take necessary risks.\n\nPlasticity factors dovetail with personal growth orientation, flowing together into Erikson's last two developmental tasks: Middle Adulthood Generativity vs. Stagnation, and Late Adulthood Integrity vs. Despair. It's important to maintain ambition as part of the story, but not to an extreme, understand who we are and where we fit into a broader sense of purpose and meaning, and at the same time enjoy ourselves along the way."

In fact, after our conversation in Brussels in the presence of all European leaders, nothing surprises anymore.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting for our lives, Fico is fighting for money, and it\u2019s unlikely that money is for Slovakia. Shadow agreements with Putin are either a trade of state interests or working for personal gain.\n\n\u201cWe offered him solutions regarding potential compensation for Slovaks \u2013 the Slovaks specifically \u2013 for losses from Russian transit, as well as alternatives for transit \u2013 any other gas, not Russian, at the request of the European Commission. We were ready to do this. Fico did not want compensation for the Slovaks. And he does not want to cooperate with the European Commission. For some reason, he finds Moscow more profitable.\n\n\u201cEveryone in Europe understands why. There\u2019s no one who doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRussian gas flows faster in face of Ukraine criticism\n\n08:45 , Albert Toth\n\nRussia\u2019s Gazprom said that it would send 42.4 million cubic metres of gas to Europe via Ukraine on Tuesday, up from 42.1 mcm on Monday.\n\nThe slight uptick in distribution comes after Zelensky said he would not allow contracts for gas exports which flow from Russia to Europe through Ukraine to be renewed.\n\nIn reaction to the announcement, Slovakia PM Robert Fico met with Putin on Monday for the first time since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nGazprom\u2019s exports to Europe and beyond decreased sharply following Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, dropping by 90 billion cubic metres (bcm) in a single year to 63.8 billion over the year.\n\nThis dropped again in 2023 to 28.3 bcm, and is estimated to reach 32 bcm overall for 2024.\n\nHowever, these figures are all staggeringly low compared to Gazprom\u2019s pre-war exports, with the 2018/19 peak of 180 bmc remaining far out of reach.\n\nUkraine launches first robot-only assault on Russia\n\n08:13 , Albert Toth\n\nUkraine has successfully mounted its first robot-only assault against Russia, its the military says, as unmanned vehicles pushed back Moscow\u2019s forces over the weekend.\n\nIn a display of modern warfare, Kyiv used dozens of remote-controlled vehicles mounted with machine guns, as well as unmanned kamikaze drones, in a raid near the Ukrainian-held town of Lyptsi, the Ukrainian military said.\n\nVolodymyr Dehtiarov, a representative for Ukraine\u2019s Khartiia Brigade, said: \u201cWe are talking about dozens of units of robotic and unmanned equipment simultaneously on a small section of the front.\u201d\n\nThe assault took place between Russian-held Hlyboke and Ukrainian-held Lyptsi, in the Kharkiv region near Ukraine\u2019s north-western border.\n\nKyiv has struggled with a shortage of manpower as the fight against invadin Russian troops continues into 2025.

The Kremlin also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRussia captures two villages in Ukraine as Moscow\u2019s forces advance on two cities\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 05:00 , Namita Singh\n\nRussian forces captured two villages in Ukraine, one in Kharkiv region in the northeast and one in eastern Donetsk region, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday.\n\nDonetsk region is where Moscow is concentrating most of its efforts to seize two cities.\n\nRussian forces, making steady progress across Donetsk region, are moving on the towns of Pokrovsk, a logistics centre and site of an important coking colliery, and appear to be closing in on Kurakhove, farther south.\n\nFile: A man rides on a bike in front of the mail office which was destroyed by a Russian airstrike in Kurakhove, Donetsk region (AP)\n\nThe Defence Ministry statement said troops had taken control of Lozova, near the town of Kupiansk, in an area north of Donetsk region also under Russian pressure in recent weeks. The village of Sontsivka, north of Kurakhove, was also captured.\n\nThe ministry on Saturday announced the capture of another village near Kurakhove, Kostiantynopolske.\n\nThe Ukraine military\u2019s general staff made no mention of those villages falling into Russian hands, but said Sontsivka was in a sector subject to 26 Russian attacks in the past 24 hours. The general staff also reported heavy fighting near Pokrovsk, with 34 Russian attempts to pierce defences.\n\nThe popular Ukrainian military blog DeepState said Sontsivka was under Russian control.\n\nRussian reports have described intensified pressure on Kurakhove.\n\nWho are the other European leaders who met Putin?\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 04:36 , Namita Singh\n\nVisits and phone calls from European leaders to Vladimir Putin have been rare since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine, although Hungary\u2019s prime minister Viktor Orban visited Russia in July, and Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer met with the Russian leader just weeks into the full-scale war.\n\nBoth trips drew condemnation from Kyiv and European leaders.\n\nMr Orban, widely seen as having the warmest relations with Mr Putin among EU leaders, has routinely blocked, delayed or watered down EU efforts to assist Kyiv and impose sanctions on Moscow for its actions in Ukraine.\n\nHe has long argued for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine but without outlining what that might mean for the country\u2019s territorial integrity or future security.\n\nVladimir Putin shakes hands with Slovakia\u2019s prime minister Robert Fico prior to their talks in Moscow on 22 December 2024 (AFP via Getty Images)\n\nRussian pressident Vladimir Putin meets Slovak prime minister Robert Fico in Moscow (EPA)\n\nMr Fico\u2019s views on Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine differ sharply from most other European leaders. The Slovakian PM returned to power last year after his leftist party Smer won parliamentary elections on a pro-Russia and anti-American platform. Since then, he has ended his country\u2019s military aid for Ukraine, lashed out at EU sanctions on Russia, and vowed to block Ukraine from joining Nato.\n\nMr Fico has also been a rare senior EU politician to appear on Russian state TV following Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In an interview with the Rossiya-1 channel in October, he contended the West has \u201cprolonged the war\u201d by supporting Ukraine, adding that sanctions against Russia were ineffective. He declared that he was ready to negotiate with Putin.\n\nMr Fico also vowed to attend a military parade in Moscow next May that will mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany\u2019s defeat in World War II. The Kremlin has used the annual \u201cVictory Day\u201d celebrations to tout its battlefield prowess, and Putin hailed Russian troops fighting in Ukraine as \u201cheroes\u201d at this year\u2019s event.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind Fico\u2019s rare visit to Russia\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 04:21 , Namita Singh\n\nRobert Fico\u2019s visit to Moscow was reaction to Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s opposition to gas transit to Slovakia through Ukraine.\n\nSharing details about his visit, Mr Fico said on Facebook that Ukrainian president supported sanctions against Russia\u2019s nuclear program, which was against Slovakia\u2019s interest as it relied on nuclear energy.\n\nMr Fico said Mr Putin confirmed to him that Russia is still ready to deliver gas to the West. He said the two also discussed the military situation in Ukraine, chances for a peaceful solution to the war and the bilateral relations between their two countries which Fico said they will seek to \u201cstandardise.\u201d\n\nVladimir Putin and Robert Fico pose for a photo during their meeting at the Kremlin in Moscow, (AP)\n\nHis trip, however, was condemned by the major Slovak opposition parties.\n\nSlovakia last month signed a short-term pilot contract to buy natural gas from Azerbaijan, as it prepares for a possible halt to Russian supplies through Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this year, it struck a deal to import US liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland.\n\nThe country can also receive gas through Austrian, Hungarian and Czech networks, enabling imports from Germany among other potential suppliers.\n\nUkraine says Russian forces executed five POWs\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 04:00 , Holly Evans\n\nRussian forces executed five Ukrainian prisoners of war, Ukraine\u2019s Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights, Dmytro Lubinets, said on Sunday.\n\nLubinets said on the Telegram messenger app that Russian troops shot the five unarmed soldiers after capturing them. He gave no details, but will report this fact to the UN.\n\n\u201cRussian war criminals who shoot Ukrainian prisoners of war should be brought before an international tribunal and punished with the most severe punishment provided for by law,\u201d Lubinets said.\n\nRussia did not immediately comment on the incident, but has previous denied committing war crimes.\n\nPutin holds talks with Slovakian PM Fico\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 03:02 , Namita Singh\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin yesterday hosted Slovakia\u2019s prime minister, Robert Fico, in a rare visit to the Kremlin by an EU leader since Moscow\u2019s all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nMr Fico arrived in Russia on a \u201cworking visit\u201d and met with Mr Putin one-on-one on yesterday evening, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russia\u2019s RIA news agency.\n\nAccording to Mr Peskov, the talks were expected to focus on \u201cthe international situation\u201d and Russian natural gas deliveries.\n\nRussian natural gas still flows to some European countries, including Slovakia, through Ukraine under a five-year agreement signed before the war that is due to expire at the end of this year.\n\nAt a summit in Brussels on Thursday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky told EU leaders that Kyiv has no intention of renewing the deal, something Mr Fico insisted will harm his country\u2019s interests.\n\nRussian oil refinery engulfed in flames after \u2018Ukrainian drone strike\u2019\n\nMonday 23 December 2024 02:00 , Holly Evans\n\nRussian oil refinery engulfed in flames after \u2018Ukrainian drone strike\u2019"

This week Berlin city government approved cuts of up to \u00a3108 million from its cultural budget for 2025 despite weeks of protest against the proposed measures. The plans have received vocal opposition from artists, museum leaders, and cultural organisations who fear that the sector could be set for venue closures and a hit to the city\u2019s cultural standing. The cuts represent a 12% cut on the previous year and has sparked fears that the city could lose its status as one of Europe\u2019s foremost cultural capitals.\n\nEmma Enderby, the director of the non-profit KW Institute for Contemporary Art, told The Art Newspaper: \u201cCulture and clubs bring people to Berlin. They don\u2019t come here for the food, they come here for the history and the culture.\n\nThe city has for years been considered as one of Europe's foremost cultural capitals\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very short notice, it also seems very short sighted. \u201cIn Berlin, culture costs around 2% of the overall economy, yet they\u2019re cutting us between around 10% and in some cases 50%.

            "article_content": "The more powerful the PC, the more heat it typically generates. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so impressive to see a silent mini gaming PC such as this new Cirrus7 machine, which has absolutely no fans. Cirrus7, a specialist German PC manufacturer, has been shipping the passively cooled Cirrus7 Incus since 2019, but it\u2019s now just announced a refresh to its lineup, with new CPUs from Intel and AMD from which to choose, including the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X.\n\nAs our Geekom AX8 Pro review showed, keeping a high-spec PC cool in such a small space can be tricky, usually relying on high-spinning fans to get the job done. The Cirrus 7 Incus, meanwhile, instead uses a special aluminum case to spread the heat away from the Intel or AMD CPU in use, keeping the PC silent in the process.\n\nThis highly powerful mini PC is available in several different configurations, but the new refresh allows you to choose between 14th-gen Intel Raptor Lake CPUs, such as the Intel Core i9 14900T, or brand-new AMD Ryzen 9000 series CPUs, such as the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X. The build itself uses a custom Mini-STX motherboard, with three different case designs that use metal cooling fins to help remove the heat.\n\nYou can choose your own storage, RAM, and built-in wireless connection options, as well as your preferred operating system. For a gaming build, a good configuration would be to choose an AM5 CPU such as the AMD Ryzen 7 8700G, which uses the same AMD Radeon 780M integrated GPU found in a gaming handheld such as the Asus ROG Ally X, which is capable of handling 1080p gameplay at modest settings.\n\nCombine that with 16GB RAM and a good-sized 1TB M.2 SSD for storage, using the bigger extended cooling case design, and this Cirrus 7 Incus PC will cost nearly $1,100. While that might seem expensive, this mini PC\u2019s whole design is focused on having zero fans, meaning that it\u2019s completely silent, or as close to silent as any electronic device can be.\n\nIf you\u2019re sick of fan noise ruining the immersion during your gameplay sessions, a totally fanless, passively cooled setup such as this Cirrus7 Incus machine would be a good alternative. You can check out this mini PC for yourself by visiting the Cirrus7 website using this link here, where you can test out building your own custom configuration. The German manufacturer does ship internationally, but you\u2019ll need to confirm with the company first about shipping outside of the EU.\n\nThis looks to be a great fanless mini PC, but if you\u2019re looking for more gaming power, check out our best mini gaming PC guide, where we take you through a number of options, some of which even include full-size graphics cards."

There are different tasks for every role, including cloud service architecture, development, or administration. The role falls into one of three categories:\n\n1. Cloud Architecture: Cloud architects design and implement cloud infrastructure that meets a company's technical requirements, ensuring scalability, security, and performance.\n\n2. Cloud Development: The development of the cloud relies on the action of software developers who write code and develop applications so they understand the services in the cloud perfectly.\n\n3. Cloud Administration: As a cloud administrator, engineers maintain and optimize cloud infrastructure to make sure everything operates smoothly. They manage cloud services, monitor performance, and handle security to ensure everything runs smoothly on cloud platforms.\n\nCloud technology, also known as cloud computing, has revolutionized the operation of businesses. It offers easy data storage, updating of software, and accessibility across platforms. As a cloud engineer, your task is to keep this giant network of services running."

He never thought that he'd be in the feds,\" prison expert Larry Levine, founder of Wall Street Prison Consultants, told The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"He's acclimating himself to his new surroundings. His lawyers are thanking God he's in New York, and they don't have to travel to Pennsylvania to visit him. So, he's just adjusting to where he's at.\n\n\"He'll be there for a week or so, maybe two weeks. Then maybe in a month, they'll move him where Diddy is.\n\n\"But [Diddy] can handle his s**t. I just know [Mangione] is f**king scared, and now they're probably trying to force-feed him.\n\n\"They're gonna offer him psych meds. He's gonna be like a f**king zombie. That's a given.\"\n\nYou're talking old, old, million old money. Now he can have cheese crackers, and maybe a bottle of a plastic bottle of soda. Larry Levine\n\nLevine, who served 10 years in federal prison on racketeering, securities fraud, obstruction of justice, and narcotics trafficking charges, said Mangione is in a situation unlike anything he's experienced before.\n\nThe Metropolitan Detention Center is plagued with inmate death and violence, rodents, raw sewage, understaffing, and a deteriorating infrastructure.\n\nChilling moment CEO \u2018assassin\u2019 Luigi Mangione tells classmates to \u2018challenge the world\u2019 in valedictorian speech\n\nCameron Lindsay, a former warden at the infamous federal building, told The New York Times in 2019 that the site is \"one of the most trouble, if not the most troubled facility in the Bureau of Prisons.\"\n\n'OLD MONEY' WEALTH\n\nMangione was born to a prominent, well-established Italian-American family in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nNicholas Mangione Sr., the family patriarch and the young Mangione's grandfather, left his 10 kids and 37 grandchildren an extensive multi-million dollar real estate portfolio, including country clubs, nursing homes, and a radio station.\n\nLuigi Mangione came from a privileged upbringing, attending the prestigious high school Gilman School in Baltimore, where tuition is currently $37,690 per year.\n\nHe was on the wrestling and soccer teams and was valedictorian of his graduating class of 2016.\n\nAfter high school, he continued his academic success, attending the University of Pennsylvania for his undergraduate and graduate studies.\n\nThen, after college, Mangione landed several internships with tech companies and found a job as a software engineer at TrueCar, an online marketplace based in Santa Monica, California.\n\nThe perks of his job allowed Mangione to work remotely, and he eventually found himself living in a shared space in a high-rise apartment in Honolulu, Hawaii, where he paid about $2,000 per month.\n\nDuring a trip to Thailand in April, Mangione boasted to another traveler that he was making \"lawyer money\" as a coder for TrueCar and claimed to have $6 million in his bank account thanks to his wealthy family, according to TMZ.\n\n10 Mangione, who came from a privileged upbringing, will experience a 'different life, different world' while in federal lockup, a prison expert said Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\n10 Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was executed outside the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan on the morning of December 4 Credit: AFP\n\n10 Police place bullet casing markers outside of a Hilton hotel where Brian Thompson was fatally shot Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\n'DIFFERENT LIFE, DIFFERENT WORLD'\n\nHowever, Mangione's elite lifestyle was upended when he was arrested on December 9 at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 280 miles west of where he allegedly assassinated the chief executive of UnitedHealthcare.\n\n\"You're talking old, old million, old money,\" Levine told The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"Now he can have cheese crackers and maybe a bottle of a plastic bottle of soda.\n\n\"He'll buy a honey bun. It's like all knock-offs, too. They don't sell the real s**t in the feds.\n\n\"What is it called, Mrs. Freshly - I never heard of it until I went in. I saw it once at a $.99 store.\n\n\"So, he'll be eating like off-brand, knock-off convenience, snacks, and s**t when he finally gets to get that.\"\n\nLevine added, \"So, different life, different world, you know. It's not like he's in the state where you can buy your own TV set.\n\n\"He's gonna have to deal with inmates, and he's not gonna be making the decisions.\n\n\"So yeah, that's a mindf**k.\"\n\n'LIFE BEHIND BARS'\n\nLevine compared Mangione's living conditions in the Metropolitan Detention Center to \"living in your bathroom.\"\n\n\"You know, if he's living in a cell like Diddy was for a while, you know how big those cells are? Picture living in your bathroom with no TV, no computer as well,\" Levine said.\n\n\"That's what his cell life will be like. You got nothing to read.\n\n\"Here's your Bible, though. So, he'll be reading the Bible, he'll be getting discovery, but what real discovery is there.\n\n\"He didn't commit a sophisticated crime. So, they'll give him discovery, 'We found this, and we found that this were his movements,' for the next whatever period of time.\n\n\"The guy already admitted that he did it, so you know what kind of big investigation do you need on that.\"\n\n10 The Metropolitan Detention Center is also where disgraced music mogul Sean 'Diddy' Combs is being held while he awaits trial Credit: Reuters\n\n10 Prison consultant Larry Levine believes Mangione is 'scared' and 'never expected to be in the feds' Credit: AP:Associated Press\n\n10 Surveillance video captured the moment a masked, hooded gunman assassinated Brian Thompson as he arrived at the Hilton hotel for an investor conference Credit: AP\n\n'HUMAN PING-PONG BALL'\n\nOn Monday, Mangione pleaded not guilty to 11 state criminal counts, including a first-degree murder that brands him as a terrorist.\n\nA grinning Mangione appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court, where his attorney raised issues with the New York City Police Department's \"staged\" perp walk of her client.\n\n\"He's a young man, and he's being treated like a human ping-pong ball by two warring jurisdictions here,\" defense attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo argued.\n\n\"They're treating him like a human spectacle.\"\n\nAgnifilo questions Mayor Eric Adam's presence at the December 19 perp walk, where dozens of heavily armed police officers and FBI officials waited for Mangione to arrive at a heliport near Wall Street.\n\n\"What was the New York City mayor doing at this press conference - that is utterly political,\" the attorney added.\n\n\"The New York City mayor should know more than anyone the presumption of innocence.\"\n\nDespite her concerns, Judge Gregory Carro assured Agnifilo that Mangione would receive a fair trial, saying, \"We will carefully select a jury.\"\n\nMangione's next court date in state court is scheduled for February 21.\n\nBefore then, he is expected to appear in federal court on January 18."

It\u2019s an artificial intelligence creation inspired by the mysterious drone sightings.\n\nReports of drones flying over New Jersey and other parts of the eastern U.S. have some wondering if the drones are actually unidentified flying objects (UFOs).\n\nAn Instagram post with more than 200,000 likes claims to show a video of \u201cUFOs over Maryland.\u201d An X post with over 690,000 views that shows the same video says \u201cMore #UFOs spotted in Maryland \u2026 What are these drones doing in US airspace.\u201d\n\nBut some commenters questioned whether the video was real.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nIs the video claiming to show UFOs over Maryland real?\n\nTHE SOURCES\n\nTHE ANSWER\n\nNo, the video claiming to show UFOs over Maryland isn\u2019t real. The video was made with artificial intelligence.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nThe video does not show real UFOs or even drones flying over a Maryland neighborhood. It was made using artificial intelligence. The creator of the video said he was inspired to create it by the lack of information provided by the government about drones.\n\nUsing InVid, a video forensics tool, VERIFY analyzed the video and conducted a reverse image search of each frame. The original video featuring the text \u201cNow they are over Maryland!\u201d, was posted to TikTok by Joey Malinski, a digital content creator, on Dec. 13.\n\nMalinski is the director of Maryland-based digital company ATB Productions. He took credit for the viral clip on both his TikTok and YouTube channels and also described how he made the video clip using Sora, an AI creation tool, to design the clip.\n\n\u201cWith my clip, obviously, the government hasn't been telling us about what these drones are. I've been a believer in aliens since I got visited in 2017. To me, I wanted to create something that was inspired by the original fake news. You know, UFO sightings and Bat Boy in the cave. Now we have me on a cell phone, shooting AI video of stuff that's plausible. Because the plausibility is why it's believable,\u201d Malinski says in the video.\n\nTo achieve the \u201cplausibility\u201d effect, he told VERIFY he chose to mimic existing drone videos circulating online, opting for a \u201chandheld, shot-on-a-cellphone\u201d style to make it appear authentic, while simultaneously incorporating elements that made it intentionally fake.\n\n\u201cI included the traditional \u2018circular\u2019 UFO design, flashing lights, and added the X-Files theme music to enhance the darkness and humor of the concept,\u201d Malinski explained.\n\nHe said he thought adding the music would be a giveaway that the video was fake, but the clearest indicator the video was AI-generated is how the lights reflect on the trees, a detail where AI \u201cstill struggles with realism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis video was an example of how surprisingly easy it is to make something look \u2018real,\u2019\u201d Malinski said.\n\nPentagon Press Secretary John Kirby has explained that the drone sightings include a mix of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones, and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even misidentified stars. Senior officials from the FBI, Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have stated the drones don\u2019t pose a national security threat, safety risk, or connection to foreign actors."

            "article_content": "Over the last decade or so, quantum computing has become the talk of computer town. Their potential to solve complex problems much faster than classical computers is an intriguing proposition that could benefit, if not transform, several industries.\n\nThe working of a quantum computer is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, an area of physics that deals with the smallest particles in the universe.\n\nPhysicist Richard Feynman proposed the idea of developing a computer to simulate quantum systems in 1982. He discussed the idea of a universal computer that could simulate all physics \u2014 both quantum and classical. Researchers realised classical computers, the computers of today, would struggle with the complexity of quantum systems and thus the idea of a quantum computer was born.\n\nSince then, scientists have made significant progress in quantum computing.\n\nBasics of quantum computing\n\nClassical computers work on the principles of classical physics. Their fundamental computing unit is the bit: each bit represents one piece of information with two possible values, 0 or 1. It is possible to represent all types of information as a combination of 0s and 1s using the binary system.\n\nQuantum computers rely on quantum bits or qubits to perform computations. Unlike classical bits, qubits can exist in the states 0, 1 or in a state that\u2019s partly 0 and partly 1. In this context, state refers to all the possible values the qubit can have.\n\nThe ability of qubits to be in two states is known as superposition. Superposition is one of two fundamental principles that animate quantum computers.\n\nImagine a spinning coin. While the coin is spinning, it can be both heads or tails, and it isn\u2019t until the coin collapses that you can see which it is. A qubit is like a spinning coin that holds both values simultaneously.\n\nWhen a qubit is measured, it collapses to one of the values, 0 or 1. This means while a classical bit holds one unit of information, a qubit can hold two. Because of this quantum computers can perform multiple computations simultaneously, with the measurement revealing one of the possible outcomes of the computations.\n\nThe second fundamental principle upon which quantum computers are based is called entanglement. This phenomenon allows qubits to be intrinsically linked no matter how far apart they physically are. Albert Einstein famously called it \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d.\n\nSo measuring the state of one of the qubits could immediately yield information about the state of the other. Say you have a pair of gloves. Each glove is put in a separate box and sent to different locations, and we don\u2019t know which box has which. But once a box is opened to reveal the left glove, we instantly know the other box has the right glove.\n\nThe instantaneous correlation between qubits allows shared information to be processed simultaneously, speeding up computations that would take far longer with classical computers.\n\nSuperposition and entanglement can\u2019t be described by classical theories of physics. They are exclusive to quantum mechanics \u2014 and central to the potential that quantum computers have to offer.\n\nSignificant milestones\n\nQuantum computers are technologically superior but this doesn\u2019t automatically mean they will be better than classical computers at different tasks.\n\nOver the years, experts have developed and honed specific tasks that prove quantum computers are capable of greater feats, and also show how.\n\nIn 1994, Bell Labs computer scientist Peter Shor created the famous Shor\u2019s algorithm. The algorithm could factorise (or find the factors of) large numbers in moments rather than the millions of years required by classical computers.\n\nThis has major implications for data security. Current methods to secure data involve locking the data and hiding the key to unlock it in the solution of a difficult mathematical problem.\n\nLarge-number factorisation is one such problem and classical computers require enormous amounts of resources to solve it. But using Shor\u2019s algorithm, a quantum computer could quickly solve the problem and open the locks.\n\nThe state of quantum computing came a long way in the next 25 years. In 2019, for example, IBM unveiled the world\u2019s first circuit-based commercial quantum computer Q System One. Circuit-based designs are believed to be the most versatile for general quantum-computing applications.\n\nQ System One uses quantum circuits composed of quantum gates that manipulate qubits, analogous to how classical computers use logic gates.\n\nIn the same year, researchers at Google reported in a paper in Nature that their 53-qubit \u2018Sycamore\u2019 processor had achieved quantum supremacy.\n\nA quantum computer achieves quantum supremacy when it can solve a problem that would take classical computers an unreasonable amount of time. The paper claimed Sycamore completed a task in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer 10,000 years.\n\nEarlier this month, in fact, Google unveiled a quantum chip called Willow, purportedly the world\u2019s first quantum processor in which error-corrected qubits improve as they scale.\n\nQuantum states are easily prone to errors due to interactions with the environment. Quantum computers need error correction to hold information long enough to perform useful calculations with them.\n\nWillow, Google has said, can finish a standard test in five minutes whereas the same calculation would take today\u2019s best supercomputers 10 trillion trillion years.\n\nPresent limitations\n\nThe advancements are flying thick and fast but there are still many significant challenges to overcome before quantum computers can become (relatively) common.\n\nThe chief concern is that building quantum computers remains expensive and complex. Keeping many qubits stable is also difficult because of error rates and decoherence (when a qubit loses superposition because of noise from its surroundings).\n\nThe problems for which we really need quantum computers \u2014 like discovering new drugs or cracking mysteries in astronomy \u2014 also require millions of qubits.\n\nAll said, their potential to be useful is clear. This is why India launched the National Quantum Mission in 2023. The government has set aside \u20b96,000 crore for the mission to be spent over eight years, among other things to develop quantum computers.\n\nTejasri Gururaj is a freelance science writer and journalist with a master\u2019s degree in physics"
