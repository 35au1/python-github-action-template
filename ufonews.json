By the way, the U.S Embassy,' as Elizondo told attendees at the paid event, gesturing to the photo: 'That.'\n\n\"'There's a whole lot more here folks.\n\n\"We're having pilots, military pilots and civilian pilots in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East, report what unimaginably seems impossible\n\n\"I just want to give you kind of a small taste of what's going on \"behind the scenes.\"\"\n\nThe startling claim directly links the U.S government to a deliberate alien cover-up, that he was exposing at the bizarre presentation.\n\nLUIS' CLAIMS HAVE DRAWN STRONG BACKLASH\n\nThese claims have drawn intense speculation from critics.\n\nVeteran US Air Force Staff Sergeant, Jeremy McGowan, witnessed a sensational UFO encounter in the Middle East decades ago.\n\nDespite this, he has cast strong doubt on Luis' credibility.\n\nJeremy said: \"This unfortunate situation with Lue follows my experiences with him nearly exactly.\n\n\"I witnessed him exaggerate or outright fabricate information that simply wasn't true.\n\n\"I've been on the receiving end where Lue has pulled out his cell phone and shown me what he described as highly classified video.\n\n\"For him to think I would believe he would simply carry classified info on an unsecure civilian cell phone is just insulting.\n\n\"And it wasn't just me, multiple podcast hosts were shown video Lue attributed to things they were not.\"\n\nIn the mid-90s, while serving as a member of the JSOC J2 Security Team for \"Ellipse Foxtrot,\" Jeremy says he was a witness to unusual aerial lights.\n\nAccording to reports, tickets to Luis' revelatory event at The City Winery, a Pennsylvania wine bar, cost between $30-$50 (\u00a323-38).\n\nCRITICS THINK THEY HAVE FOUND THE TRUTH\n\nIt did not take long for other internet sleuths to poke holes in Luis' outlandish statements.\n\nJohn Greenewald Jr, a government transparency advocate, tracked the photo back to September 2023, in a Facebook group called \"Mysterious Ancient Discoveries\".\n\nThis pic appears more likely to have originated as the reflection of an indoor chandelier reflected in window glass.\n\nThe Facebook picture has over 180,000 likes and 23,000 comments, suggesting the public were aware of the snap.\n\nFurther examination of the pic allegedly showed that it was not actually linked to the U.S Embassy, as Luis claimed.\n\nThe photo background appeared to show the Arad Power Station, a coal-fired plant.\n\nAmerica's Embassy is roughly 400 miles to the southeast of Arad, and is actually placed in the capital city Bucharest.\n\nLUIS HAS MORE EVENTS SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER\n\nOn October 30, two days after his paid event, Luis clarified that any misinformation involved in his presentation was the fault of his \"friend in the government\" who reportedly supplied the image.\n\nLuis has been criticised by the UFO community, who have accused him of using them as pawns in a money-making scheme.\n\nOne Reddit on the forum e/UFOs, one user remarked, \u201cLue is 100% using us as pawns to line his pockets.\n\n\"His most recent book was no.1 seller in the nation.\"\n\nAccording to Luis' X account, he has five more speaking engagements lined up for November.\n\nThe tagline on the promotional poster reads \"WE ARE NOT ALONE\".\n\n4 The Facebook group \"Mysterious Ancient Discoveries\" where critics think the pic was actually taken from Credit: Facebook"

A photo that was provided to me by a friend in Government a couple of years ago was presented by me two days ago at our engagement in Philadelphia. Looks like we can put this one bed, as our friends in Twitter figured/solved this one, major bravo to you! Excellent work to whoever solved this one and a big thank you! Crowdsourcing works. Now let\u2019s see if together we can figure out the rest. As folks at the show will attest, this is precisely why I showed the first few slides at the beginning with an example of a fake UAP. We must continue to be vigilant and always go where the data leads. As you know, I will always own up to any mistakes I make. A good lesson here, just because someone in Government gives me something, due diligence and scrutiny is always a good idea. Onwards and upwards!\n\nMeanwhile, the Daily Mail reports, retired United States Air Force Staff Sergeant Jeremy McGowan, who has had his own experiences with UFOs, said he has \u201cwitnessed him exaggerate or outright fabricate information that simply wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on the receiving end where Lue has pulled out his cell phone and shown me what he described as highly classified video,\u201d McGowan told the Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cFor him to think I would believe he would simply carry classified info on an unsecure civilian cell phone is just insulting. And it wasn\u2019t just me, multiple podcast hosts were shown video Lue attributed to things they were not.\u201d\n\nElizondo, recently published a book titled Imminent: Inside the Pentagon\u2019s Hunt for UFOs, about his alleged time working on the Pentagon\u2019s UFO program.\n\nIn 2017, a U.S. Department of Defense spokesperson confirmed the AATIP was real and it had been run by Luis Elizondo. However, after Elizondo began sharing some of his alleged UFO secrets, the Pentagon backtracked and claimed he \u201chad no responsibilities.\u201d"

By the way, the US Embassy,' as Elizondo told attendees at the paid event, gesturing to the photo: 'That.'\n\nHe went on to describe it as a 'huge mini city floating in the sky.'\n\nBut the UFO, which resembles a gleaming disc-shaped craft, has already drawn withering critiques from skeptics, believers and even military UFO witnesses alike, who claim to have traced the photo to, not to the US Embassy, but a Facebook page.\n\nOne suggested to DailyMail.com that Elizondo has been lax in his vetting of such images in a bid to add sensational new material to his 'paid speaking engagements.'\n\nEx-Pentagon official Luis Elizondo (right), who gained fame for blowing the lid off a $22-million, secretive government UFO program, has revealed an image of a UFO 'mothership'\n\n'Guess what we caught in Romania in 2022? By the way, the US Embassy,' as Elizondo told attendees at the paid event, gesturing to the photo (above): 'That'\n\nVeteran US Air Force Staff Sergeant, Jeremy McGowan, who witnessed a dramatic UFO encounter himself in the Middle East decades ago, told DailyMail.com that Elizondo's dubious 'mothership' UFO fits a pattern with the man's past claims.\n\n'This unfortunate situation with Lue follows my experiences with him nearly exactly,' McGowan said. 'I witnessed him exaggerate or outright fabricate information that simply wasn't true.'\n\nElizondo unveiled the 2022 Romanian UFO photo at an October 28, 2024 event held at The City Winery, a wine bar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for $50-$30 per ticket.\n\n'There's a whole lot more here folks,' Elizondo told the audience in a leaked clip. 'I just want to give you kind of a small taste of what's going on \"behind the scenes.\"'\n\n'We're having pilots, military pilots and civilian pilots in Eastern Europe and in the Middle East, report what unimaginably seems impossible,' as Elizondo began to explain his 'real photo' of a UFO.\n\n'They described it literally 'the mothership,'' Elizondo said.\n\nBut despite credible federal reports of 'mothership' UFOs over domestic US military sites \u2014 investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), an FBI task force, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) and 16 local sheriff's offices \u2014 internet sleuths quickly managed to poke holes in Elizondo's 2022 Romanian UFO.\n\nJohn Greenewald Jr, a longtime government transparency advocate who runs The Black Vault, quickly tracked the photo back to a September 13, 2023 post in a Facebook group titled 'Mysterious Ancient Discoveries.'\n\nJohn Greenewald Jr, a longtime government transparency advocate who runs The Black Vault , quickly tracked the photo back to a September 13, 2023 post in a Facebook group titled ' Mysterious Ancient Discoveries' (above)\n\nThe higher resolution image of this apparent 'mothership,' which looks at first glance to be piercing clouds with its beatific shafts of light, appears more likely to have originated as the reflection of an indoor chandelier lamp reflected in window glass\n\n'I reverse imaged searched it,' Greenewald posted on X. 'It got more than 182,000 likes and more than 23,700 comments.'\n\nThe higher resolution image of this apparent 'mothership,' which looks at first glance to be piercing clouds with its beatific shafts of light, appears more likely to have originated as the reflection of an indoor chandelier lamp reflected in window glass.\n\nThe placement of Romania's coal-fired Arad Power Station indicates the image was not taken from the US Embassy, but a building near the Mure\u0219 River a few miles away.\n\nAmerica's Embassy in Romania is roughly 400 miles to the southeast of Arad, in the capital city of Bucharest.\n\nWhile dedicated UFO skeptics were eager to pounce on Elizondo's inaccurate claims, UFO enthusiasts also expressed frustration over the episode.\n\n'Lue is 100 percent using us as pawns to line his pockets,' one contributor to the Reddit forum r/UFOs lamented. 'His most recent book was no.1 seller in the nation.'\n\n'It's muddying the waters and detracting from the important convo,' another opined.\n\nBy midday Wednesday, Elizondo was publicly attributing the error to 'a friend in Government' who provided him with the photo 'a couple of years ago.'\n\nRetired USAF Staff Sergeant McGowan, however, told DailyMail.com that Elizondo's error was far from a one-off mistake.\n\n'I've been on the receiving end where Lue has pulled out his cell phone and shown me what he described as highly classified video,' McGowan told DailyMail.com.\n\nThe placement of Romania's coal-fired Arad Power Station (above) indicates the image was not taken from the US Embassy, but a building near the Mure\u0219 River a few miles away. America's Embassy in Romania is roughly 400 miles to the southeast of Arad, in Bucharest\n\n'For him to think I would believe he would simply carry classified info on an unsecure civilian cell phone is just insulting,' he added. 'And it wasn't just me, multiple podcast hosts were shown video Lue attributed to things they were not.'\n\nFor the past two years, McGowan has been notably public about this instance in which Elizondo showed him what he claimed was, in McGowan's words, 'a highly secret video smuggled out of Russia' taken by a Soviet Union probe near Mars.\n\nThe video, as McGowan recollected to DailyMail.com, looked to be a decades-old public UFO video from the Soviet's Phobos 2 probe, released by retired Soviet Air Force Colonel Marina Popovich in 1991.\n\nElizondo had shown the video to McGowan, in hushed tones, in January 2021.\n\nWhile Popovich, who wrote a book about her own UFO encounters as a test pilot, long maintained the Phobos 2 video depicted a legitimate alien craft, the odd video had nevertheless been public for about three decades, in other words.\n\n'There is a striking similarity between that public video and what Lue showed me on his phone,' McGowan recollected.\n\n'Only saw it for a few seconds,' he said, 'so the granular details didn't get absorbed.'\n\nMcGowan, whose duties in the Air Force included service in Desert Storm attached to Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and drug enforcement missions in Colombia, has been public for years on his own UFO encounter.\n\nIn the mid-90s, while serving as a member of the JSOC J2 Security Team for 'Ellipse Foxtrot,' Jeremy McGowan (above) says he was a witness to unusual aerial lights appearing to survey a highly classified cargo container he had been tasked with guarding in the desert\n\nFor the past two years, McGowan has been notably public about an instance in which Elizondo showed him what he claimed was, in McGowan's words, 'a highly secret video smuggled out of Russia' taken by a Soviet probe near Mars. The video however had been public since 1991\n\nIn the mid-90s, while serving as a member of the JSOC J2 Security Team for 'Ellipse Foxtrot,' McGowan says he was a witness to unusual aerial lights appearing to survey a highly classified cargo container he had been tasked with guarding in the desert.\n\nHe spoke to the History Channel about this UFO sighting in the Mid East for the 2020 docu-series 'Unidentified,' which had been hosted by Luis Elizondo.\n\nAs McGowan recollected about his appearance on the show in a Medium blog post, he had agreed to this on-camera interview in the hopes of getting back in touch with other witnesses to the event, but felt 'used' by the experience.\n\n'I was supposed to be introduced to investigators and researchers who could help me identify the person with me on that dune and saw what I saw!' he wrote in 2022.\n\n'I left with no answers [...] I sent a few emails to production that were ignored, and I was never extended the courtesy promised to me.'\n\nBy midday Wednesday, Elizondo was publicly attributing the error to 'a friend in Government' who provided him with the photo 'a couple of years ago' (above)\n\nElizondo unveiled the 2022 Romanian UFO photo at an October 28, 2004 event held at The City Winery, a wine bar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , for $50-$30 per ticket\n\nFederal government concern about 'mothership' UFOs harboring swarms of 'drones,' have spilled out into public view following the release of internal reports via the US Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in recent years.\n\nWeeks of reports of mystery 'drones' swept eastern Colorado and nearby areas of Nebraska, Wyoming and Kansas over the winter holidays of 2019 into the new year.\n\nThe sightings worried citizens and local law enforcement alike, but odd craft and thier 'motherships' troubled the US military especially for their proximity to some of America's sensitive, nuclear-equipped intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).\n\n'They all seem clustered in an area that has quite a few Minuteman sites,' a redacted official confessed in one email released via FOIA by F.E. Warren Air Force Base.\n\nF.E. Warren security staff spoke to local sheriff's deputies who ' reported seeing a 'mothership' six feet in diameter flanked by 10 smaller drones (some fixed wing, some not).'\n\n'When deputies follow the drones, they clock them at speeds of 60-70 mph,' the redacted base official stated."

And while Google has done a pretty good job of making it easy to use, often updating the Play Store with new elements to enhance the experience, there are folks out there that still might have questions about the process.\n\nSo how does Google intend to go beyond the current screenshots, app descriptions, and user reviews? Well, there's a good chance that the brand is going to lean more heavily into using artificial intelligence, which to be frank, shouldn't come as a surprise. We've seen previous strings in code hint that AI content is coming, and Google has also started using AI-generated highlights in the Google Play Store as well.\n\nA new way to help users\n\nWell, it appears that Google may introduce a section in the Play Store that would allow users to ask questions about the app, with AI generating helpful answers. The possible inclusion of this feature was spotted by the folks at Android Authority, with new strings in code popping up in version 43.3.32-31 of Google Play Store.\n\nThe new feature could be introduced as \"Ask a question\", and while it's unclear just how it will work, Android Authority's Aamir Siddiqui suggests that there could be a button within the app listing, which users could click, and then ask questions. Users would then get answers based on their questions that would be generated using AI.\n\nFor the most part, this would solve a lot of issues, especially for first-time Android users or those that are unclear about an app and its uses. Of course, this feature has yet to be formally announced, which means that it could come out next week, or we may never see the feature come to light. Regardless, it's interesting to see features like this being worked on, and we can only hope that it will be introduced sooner rather than later."

        "article_content": "As India continues its rapid development and is set to become a USD 7 trillion economy by 2030, businesses face immense pressure to innovate quickly and operate more efficiently than ever before. Due to the current demand to outpace competitors and respond quickly to customers, businesses today operate in a hyper-evolving environment with the need for rapid innovation, increased agility, and real-time customer care.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nWhen it comes to the application development process, for many years, only two options were available to organizations: purchasing ready-made solutions off the shelf or employing skilled programmers to create solutions from scratch. This has changed with the introduction of low-code/no-code (LCNC) development platforms that have revolutionized how businesses develop applications by making the process easy and more available to a wider section of the workforce These platforms can lead to cost reductions of up to 70% compared to traditional application development methods. In fact, a recent survey from Gartner indicates that by 2025, 87% of new applications developed by enterprises will use low-code or no-code technologies.\n\nLCNC platforms have changed the traditional development approach that could only be implemented by technical users. Now, both technical and non-technical users are able to make applications without additional coding knowledge. So, these platforms allow citizen developers to rise and become leaders in their business processes and workflows. These platforms empower \"citizen developers\" not only to adopt new techniques and strategies but also to get involved in the whole process of application development.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nUnderstanding Low-Code/No-Code Platforms\n\nFirst of all, both low-code and no-code platforms are programming customization techniques for a high level of expertise in IT, and these two differ in the extent of expertise in information technology required. Low-code development platforms offer a more user-friendly coding experience, which means that a partial amount of programming skill will be required. Thus, the developers are free to do their part of coding as well as to create applications in a personalized manner that meets the unique requirements of the user's business. On the flip side, no-code platforms are completely free from coding as they support those with no technical skills to design applications. Beyond this, businesses can also develop applications using the drag-and-drop method without employing any programmers.\n\nLCNC platforms are designed to make application development faster and more efficient. Whether automating workflows, streamlining processes, or improving customer experiences, LCNC platforms provide the flexibility and speed businesses need to stay competitive. The growing adoption of LCNC platforms has led to impressive market growth. According to Forrester, the combined low-code and digital process automation (DPA) market reached $13.2 billion by the end of 2023, with a projected growth rate of 21% since 2019. This surge is driven largely by the institutionalization of low-code in IT, with 87% of enterprise developers now using low-code platforms for some development work. Furthermore, Forrester predicts this growth to continue, with the market potentially reaching $30 billion by 2028, driven by the increasing adoption of citizen development strategies.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nFuture Growth Potential\n\nWith the rise of generative AI market growth at an annual rate of 36% according to Forrester, LCNC platforms, being inherently flexible and AI-compatible, are poised to benefit from this trend. A similar AI-driven explosion in citizen development could push the LCNC and DPA market to $50 billion by 2028. However, a shift toward high-code methods due to AI-infused development platforms might slow LCNC growth, aligning it with the broader software market's 11% annual growth rate.\n\nThe Rise of Citizen Developers\n\nAdvertisment\n\nOne of the most significant impact of LCNC platforms is the rise of citizen developers\u2014non-technical users who now actively participate in application development. These individuals, often business process owners, possess deep knowledge of their domain but lack formal coding expertise. With LCNC tools, they can develop applications that address their unique challenges, driving innovation within their departments.\n\nThousands of companies are using low-code platforms to develop business-critical solutions. As businesses mature, however, some may encounter nonstandard practices that basic low-code platforms can't address. Borrowing development practices from core development, such as unit testing or build quality control, can help improve a solution\u2019s quality and reduce team effort.\n\nApplications Across Industries\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe versatility of LCNC platforms has led to their adoption across a wide range of industries. For instance, in supply chain management, businesses can develop applications to enhance visibility, traceability, and efficiency. In manufacturing, LCNC tools are powering smart factories by integrating IoT networks and automating workflows.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nIn finance and accounting, LCNC platforms enable businesses to automate complex tasks such as loan approvals and risk assessments. Human resources teams are using them to streamline hiring processes and develop training programs, while even IT departments benefit from faster application development and increased agility.\n\nLCNC platforms play a significant role in business process automation (BPA), complementing robotic process automation (RPA) solutions. RPA bots can follow rules set by citizen developers, reducing bottlenecks and increasing efficiency.\n\nLow-code visual software development is a powerful solution for modernizing legacy systems at reduced cost and with minimal risk. Low-code platforms provide developers with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface through which they find it easier to accelerate their software development and minimize inefficiencies accompanied by security vulnerabilities typical for traditional systems. In general, legacy applications, including ERP systems, happen to be quite cumbersome to update and not cost-effective.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nHowever, low-code platforms enable organizations to modernize such systems by integrating cloud-based innovations and extending them with modern web and mobile interfaces without the need to undertake costly customized development. It also helps in the gradual phasing out of existing obsolete applications without causing a jolt.\n\nAn important feature of low-code platforms is the democratization of software development, wherein the complexity of coding work is abstracted into more user-friendly and visual interfaces. This enables the possibility of collaboration among developers with varying skill levels, accelerates time-to-market, and reduces the risk of error. In addition, the built-in security and compliance features ensure that applications are better designed and show adherence to specific industry standards, which enhances the resilience of digital infrastructure.\n\nSuch low-code platforms offer pre-built connectors and APIs that connect easily to legacy systems for easy access to data and, thus, even modernization becomes a simplified exercise. Organizations can unlock actual new opportunities for innovation by embracing low-code development, thus propelling business growth in this fast-paced digital landscape."

        "article_content": "This feature was taken from our Fleet Leadership special report\n\nIn recent years, fleet decision-makers have been hit with massive levels of hype around new technologies which are predicted to transform the way they move people and goods.\n\nBut much-talked about concepts such as mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) and self-driving vehicles have \u2013 as of yet \u2013 struggled to make any meaningful impact as either the technology, legislation or other factors have stymied their introduction.\n\nDevelopment work on them continues, however, and they are still expected to have a major impact in the future, but for now vehicle manufacturers are talking more about another concept: the software-defined vehicle (SDV).\n\n\u201cBetween about 2016 and 2021, those in OEM circles were talking about CASE \u2013 connected, automated, shared, electric \u2013 but that phrase is pretty much dead now,\u201d says Jack Palmer, principal consultant at analysts Frost and Sullivan.\n\n\u201cNo one talks about that any more. If you go through OEMs\u2019 annual statements or reports, they talk about the SDV, which brings together all of those concepts.\u201d\n\nJonathan Davenport, senior director analyst at Gartner, agrees. \u201cThe biggest trend for sure at the moment is the SDV,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the past, autonomous vehicle technology was the number one topic people were enquiring about.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s definitely about SDVs and the impact they will have on the market.\u201d\n\nEach year, Gartner assesses new mobility technologies in its hype cycle series of reports and in its Hype Cycle for Connected Electric and Autonomous Vehicles 2024 document it has described the benefit of SDVs as \u201ctransformational\u201d.\n\nUnder its ranking system, it puts them as being at the peak of inflated expectations \u2013 a period of overenthusiasm and unrealistic projections, where a flurry of well-publicised activity by technology leaders results in some successes, but more failures, as the innovation is pushed to its limits \u2013 and five-to-10 years away from entering the mainstream.\n\nWhat is an SDV?\n\nIt is already possible to make over-the-air (OTA) software updates to the on-board system of some vehicles, as well as applying software patches to improve safety or functionality.\n\nSome manufacturers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Tesla, also offer a limited number of software-based services that drivers can subscribe to, such as parking and safety assistance functions.\n\n\u201cThe consumer demand hasn\u2019t been fantastic for these, but it\u2019s certainly there,\u201d says Palmer.\n\nHowever, the SDV concept takes this idea much further and is seen as a significant evolution by the automotive industry, helping to pave the way for further technological advancements such as autonomous vehicles.\n\nKey to this is the architecture of the vehicle. Modern vehicles use an increasing number of on-board computers to make them work: a typical connected car has between 60 and 80 electronic control units (ECUs), all dedicated to a single function such as vehicle lighting, driving aids and power steering.\n\nThe idea with the SDV is to have a streamlined infrastructure using just one or two ECUs, which are much more powerful, more robust and more flexible than the vehicle needs when it is built.\n\nAs well as controlling the car\u2019s functions and process the huge amount of data collected by its various sensors, they will have the capacity to accommodate new functions without slowing the system down.\n\nThis will change the historic link between hardware and software development life-cycles.\n\n\u201cAn analogy I use is what happened in consumer electronics about 20 years ago,\u201d says Davenport.\n\n\u201cYou had all your separate electronic items; your video camera, your digital camera, your calculator, your mobile phone, etc.\n\n\u201cThe companies would encourage you to buy the new model after a couple of years so you could go from a 20MP camera to a 25MP camera, for example.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s almost where we are with automotive today as if you want to get the new functionality you need to buy another car in a few years\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cThe change we are going to see with SDV is that we will get this continuous improvement driven by the software.\u201d\n\nManufacturers will be able to offer OTA updates beyond what is currently possible, allowing them to make money from subscription sales of digital content and software-based features.\n\nIn addition, indirect monetisation benefits will be achieved through OTA updates that fix warranty or recall issues.\n\nThis will change the business model for OEMs, as they will want to drive revenue by selling software-enabled services during the vehicle\u2019s life than just the one-time sale or lease of it. These services promise to deliver much higher gross margins.\n\nStellantis, for example, forecasts around \u20ac20 billion in incremental annual revenue, with a 40% gross margin by 2030, fuelled by software-enabled vehicles.\n\nFleet benefits\n\nThe focus on software \u2013 and with it data \u2013 could have major benefits for fleets.\n\nDavenport says although some major manufacturers are developing their own operating systems, many others \u2013 including General Motors, Volvo, Ford, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and Renault Nissan Mitsubishi \u2013 are using Google\u2019s Android Automotive.\n\nThis should not be confused with Android Auto, which is a mobile app developed by Google to mirror features of a smartphone on a vehicle\u2019s infotainment system.\n\nOne potential effect is that multiple OEMs using the same operating system in their vehicles could change the way fleets use telematics.\n\nCurrently there is no way of getting consistent data collection from different brands of vehicles on a fleet unless fleet decision-makers use aftermarket devices, says Davenport.\n\n\u201cWe always see two counter-trends in the vehicle telematics space,\u201d he adds. \u201cOne is we see organisations trying to dig out the cost of their traditional telematics services so we\u2019ve seen a movement from the black box to an OBD2 dongle, potentially even going to a smartphone application or maybe sourcing data direct from the automotive manufacturer.\n\n\u201cThe counter-trend is that the video telematics space is putting higher-performance computers in an aftermarket box into the vehicle.\n\n\u201cBut what I think could happen with Android Automotive is that an application could be deployed into the different vehicles\u2019 infotainment systems to request things like access to the forward-facing camera, access to the driver monitoring system etc., and so you could have a fleet management package that runs in the vehicle.\n\n\u201cThe automotive manufacturers are still acting as gatekeepers to their application marketplaces, so that may impede this vision, but certainly in the longer term I think that\u2019s what will happen as Android Automotive provides the common data platform that we\u2019ve never really had in the past.\u201d\n\nPalmer identifies a further area where SDVs could benefit fleets \u2013 rental vehicles.\n\n\u201cOne area I really see big potential for, but don\u2019t see any conversation about, is on the rental side,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cThe concept of features on demand \u2013 the idea of flexibly buying or accessing features for a short amount of time \u2013 surely makes sense for the rental sector.\n\n\u201cA customer could get a vehicle, upload their profile and then have all the features they want to use: this sounds like a fantastic use case.\u201d\n\nGartner says the introduction of SDVs will also eventually lead to a new market for car hardware upgrades as eventually \u2013 and as with smartphones and computers \u2013 there will come a point when an SDV\u2019s factory-installed computing hardware will not be able to cope with in-life software advancements.\n\nOn average, a passenger car\u2019s useful life is around 12 years in the US and Europe, it says, and this will increase given the greater longevity of electric vehicles.\n\nThis means the widespread adoption of the zero-emission technology will bring a major long-term drop in the revenue from new car sales and aftersales for OEMs.\n\nHowever, easy and price-competitive vehicle hardware updates will allow OEMs to keep selling new digital features/services to the owner to replace this lost revenue, as well as extending an SDV\u2019s useful life.\n\nIn today's rapidly changing world, fleet managers aren't just managing vehicles\u2014they're leading critical conversations about strategy, sustainability, and efficiency. And whether you realise it or not, you are at the centre of key decisions that shape your business.\n\nYou play a pivotal role where finance, HR, operations, and procurement meet, ensuring cost efficiency, legal compliance, and CSR efforts are realised. Fleet managers are at the heart of driving business success.\n\nOur latest special report on \u201cFleet Leadership\u201d is packed with insights and strategies to help you become a standout leader in your organisation.
